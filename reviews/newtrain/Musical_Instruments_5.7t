It's fine for the price. Quality is OK. My only quibble would be capacity: With only 7 harps, you just know someone's going to call out a tune for which you don't have the proper key. 8 or 9 would be perfect.	1
My wife was always on to me about leaving harmonicas all over the house.  this was the answer. The pouch is made for 7 but you can get 8 or 9 inside if you need to.  It is very compact and well made.  It also has a pocket inside the top cover you can slip a little music or tabs into and a nice Lee Oscar "bumper sticker" is included.  For me I'd rather cary this around than a brief case, but that's just me.  I'm sure I'll probably get another one as my collection keeps growing.	1
This is a nice case for storing and carrying 7 harmonicas. It's not crush proof so if your carrying high end custom harps looks for something else. If you want an easy to use storage for you cheaper backup harps it works great. It also has a single pocket on the inside for notes or polishing cloth.	1
Real made in Paris....Best (Easy-to-use) but high price.	1
works great	1
Cool capo. Haven't got to mess with it much but want to get another one to play open tunings without having to tune. Definatly is recommend to an open minded guitarist that likes to experiment.	1
Great product! Works just like it should!	1
Great little capo. Much much better than cutting out the rubber to customize.	1
Nice product. Good price, but be careful if you use this Live...	1
This item is pretty much not worth the few dollars that this cost. It's $5 cheaper than when I bought this now and even at 5 bucks cheaper, being hollow does NOT produce high quality sound. I guess my 5 bar wind chime is far louder and brighter than this. It won't be worth using while I perform live as I can barely hear this in a quiet room. Because the bars are hollow, they continually hit each other thus bouncing of each other with the same sound that is all over the place.	-1
Makes her $100  Clarinet sound like it costs $3,000! Terrific Investment!	1
Like this ligature a lot and it's far, far superior to the one that came with my sax (an Antigua Pro One alto). It might not fit all mouthpieces, but it fits a Vandoren V16 A6 mouthpiece fine, which is what I use. It's very easy to use. I love the fact that the screw mechanism turns so easily and feels very high quality. It does fit snugly, but I like that, because you don't need to spend much time loosening or tightening it, since it already goes on pretty snug. Nice!	1
This ligature does not fit my mouthpiece, which is a  Vandoren M30D.  It is SO tight...I had the screw "at capacity" (as loose as I could get it), and with a reed on, I couldn't even turn the screw.  It was a struggle to get the reed on straight.  When I managed it, I found that no matter what plate I used, my sound is the same as with my Silverstein ligature.  I do love to try new things, sometimes they just don't work out!	1
Warmer sounding version of the metal optimum.	1
The product itself works great, except if you're trying to capo G-E it starts sliding up and off. But that could just be a neck issue. I for one, don't use it much but it functions how it's supposed to and it's Kyser; they make really good, long lasting stuff.	1
Cut capo lets you play all three chords of a given key with only one or two fingers.  Great for beginners, for the handicapped, or for someone wanting to experiment with alternative tuning. The chords have an inverted voicing.	1
its a capo, it works	1
Too small for my classical, but great for all my other guitars.	1
I've really enjoyed using this over the last week.  I wouldn't really compare it to DADGAD, but it's close (in Esus4).  Very well built like I would expect from Kyser.	1
opened another level of guitar playing for me, not a pro but i have a pretty sweet tune now from this little guy.	1
Very effective for the price.  A little difficult to figure out how to put on initially, but was able to do it by looking at pictures.	1
Good tone and quality if you are a 3rd finger player. Very loose pinky slide, unless that is what you are going for. I wear an extra large glove. Slide doesn't shatter so easy as antique glass, so its safe in a case with accessories.	1
Met all expectations, good price, great quality,  good feel.	1
Delivered on time and as described.  A useful purchase.	1
GREAT PRODUCT.  GOOD PRICE.	1
These are really fun to play with.  Work best on 6 string acoustic guitars.	1
Works very well. Just pull slowly when using this on the upper part of the clarinet.	1
This is the best swab I have owned.  It does tangle inside the upper bore, so getting it worn in is important.	1
really gets clarinet dry	1
Smooth/Soft. Doesn't get stuck. Does the job. Durable. A must have for a clarinet player of all levels!! (I mean, it is Vandoren... Vandoren makes everything good)	1
I managed to get this swab stuck in my clarinet the second day I used it. It's a little bulky for the upper joint, and it got caught on the register tube. I ripped the material as I pulled it out. I was being very careful.  I'd recommend purchasing a silk swab.	-1
Love the open E suspended this capo produces when placed on the 2nd fret. I also add a full capo with the cut capo. i.e. Full capo on the 2nd fret and the cut on the 4th. It makes a really cool F# suspended sound.	1
works great	1
Strong, absorbent, and haven't had any issues running it through the bass as of yet - I have a Buffet 1193 bass clarinet w/a Backun custom bell. It holds a lot of moisture, but is almost as smooth as silk. Great idea. One problem, is that it holds onto that moisture a bit too long, so... when ya get home from the gig, open the case and dry it out, or better, keep it out of a case until it dries. Still, I think it's the best swab I've used for bass clarinet.	1
This swab is working fine for me. No complaints	1
I was concerned because of the size. Not a problem at all. It works much better than my old chamois. This is more expensive than the the others but is worth every penny. Why skimp on this considering the cost of repair or replacement of your clarinet? My highest recommendation.	1
My daughter loves this swab for her clarinet.	1
A+++ as described and shown in photo.	1
If you need a quick change cut capo, this is the best.  Great tone quality and it holds the tuning well.	1
I play in different tunings and just slapping this on a standard tuned guitar makes for a lot of fun.  That's all I can say.  It makes me creative and I have easily thrown together a dozen instrumental fingerstyle tunes using this.  It's just fun.	1
Very well made with large size cloth (compared to the manufacturer supplied skimpy one).	1
This is the second purchase for me, since it works with the flute, of course the flute has to have its own swab.  Works best if pulled slowly through the instrument to allow time for it to absorb the liquid.	1
Perfect to clean the clarinet	1
Great seller delivered as expected,I will order from them again!***** Great product as expected.	1
Oh my..... I had no idea a mouthpiece would make such a difference.  Bought my first tenor sax at the end of Feb.  I've been playing for less than 6 mos... but instructor said, "you are not going to get the big sound you are looking for, until you invest in something like a Selmer C*"  Had bought my sax on Amazon and took it to a local place and had it checked out... all good, tried lots of mouthpieces, but only found the leather ligature made a difference for me.  Six months later--- I have been reminded that I tried the mouthpieces before I learned to play sax.  I agreed, but I wasn't prepared to spend over $150 for a mouthpiece, yet - so I tried this one.  I obviously can't compare to the C*, but I can say that it is an amazing improvement over the stock mouthpiece that comes with my tenor.  I have a fuller tone and my low notes are huge!  Thank you!  This will keep me playing until next year when I've proven I am a player, not just a learner.  Until then, I am VERY HAPPY with this mouthpiece.	1
As a beginner alto sax player I chose this mouthpiece as a step up from the Yamaha 4C. It has a wider tip opening than the 4C, thus produces brighter sound. I have a LJ Hutchen student model alto sax and I use this mouthpiece in conjunction with a Rico Royal # 2 or Vandoren Java # 2.5 reed and a Rovner 1RL ligature. I have used this mouthpieces to play romantic ballads, jazz and merengue. This is a very good choice for beginner alto sax players!	1
Selmer seems to still be a selmer...35 years latter. The mouthpiece is good. I noticed a improvement in tone over a stock moutheice I have used various brands of alto and and tenor sax mouthpieces,since 1980. Hard rubber,metal...you name it. I always gravitated to a number 3 Selmer. Works for my chops..I can recommend this brand.	1
I was pleasantly surprised to play on this Selmer Tenor mouthpiece. It is a noticeable step up from my starter, Belmonte mouthpiece I was so comfortable with. It has a nice design and is easy to play. I smoothed out some of my problem areas nicely .I also purchased the Brillhardt Rico Metalite 7 to try and just couldn't make the same music as with this mouthpiece. I think the Metalite 7 is probably beyond my skill level so I put it away for a few months and will concentrate on how far I can go with this, as it felt "Good " right away. I was really pleased with the price too. Now ...I want a good cap to protect it!	1
I'm no cheater with a capo. If I'm using a capo, it's for a darn good reason. THIS capo opens up infinite possibilities for exploring cool chords and tonal things. It's the difference between a great guitarist and a downright virtuoso.	1
this capo helps make aesome music, thankful for it, i like using it for all kinds of palying, like at the beach	1
This neck strap makes me itch like crazy and will probably make you itch like crazy too. Get the Rico instead much better or perhaps a better neckstrap that I have seen the professional Jon Manasse is the BG Clarinet Neckstrap. It is on 1stopclarinet (just Google the name).	-1
This item arrived several weeks ago, When it arrived I was very pleased to see it was of a high quality- with especially good zippers. The only improvement I can think of would be to include more stitching on the inside where the Drumsticks are separated as to allow for better Stick organization.	1
The Keyser Short-Cut Capo is an amazing tool that opens up a whole new world of possibilities for guitarists. I have been playing guitar for nearly 40 years and this capo makes the guitar feel like a new instrument to me. As with all Kyser products, this capo is a finely-crafted tool whose value far exceeds the price paid.  I also highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/PARTIAL-CAPO-THE-BASICS-TIPS-TRICKS-AND-MORE-BK-CD/dp/1423421361/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">PARTIAL CAPO: THE BASICS, TIPS, TRICKS, AND MORE BK/CD</a>&nbsp;here on Amazon. This guide will get you up to speed quickly. It's inexpensive and chock full of TnT. It includes a CD but the guide was so well written that I never found the need to use it.  If you're a guitarist and want to open up new territories on your fret board, get these two products and prepare to spend hours exploring the new landscape on your guitar. It's a blast!	1
I needed another kazoo and this is a good one, not plastic.	1
I use kazoos in musical performances and find the metal ones louder and more substantial than the plastic.  I know most people buy kazoos as toys but can't tell you how much adults like them if you bring them out late enough at a cocktail party. I've bought several of these for my own use and as giveaways. They come boxed and would make a nice little stocking stuffer or party favor.	1
This is a well made strap. I use it for my clarinet and am very happy with the wide, thick neck strap. The hook is easy to adjust and secure.	1
Installed it and it doesnt work at all. Im so bummed out.guess ill have to buy a new pedal. Disappointing......	-1
made my VOX wah pedal sound better than it did before the pot got scratchy. replacement was simple provided you know how to solder	1
says made in usa on the package, wrong says mexico on the pot!	-1
My Cry Baby got all scratchy sounding. I swapped the pot with this and it sounds great again.	1
I follow Teese's advice and change the wiper capacitor to a .33mf. What else is there? These things last forever.	1
This partial capo from Kyser has the same design, construction, and ease of use as Kyser's top-ranked and bestselling 6-string cano. It is definitely recommended. If you choose to go down he partial capo path, though, it's best that you either jam with friends who are familiar with partial capos or buy Randall Wolliams' manual on the partial capo, since its use is not intuitively obvious.	1
Just bought this to see if it would inspire any new sounds for me.  WOW I love it.  The capo works great with no buzzing and holds the strings down well.  I am using it with a Seagull Entourage mini jumbo.  It sounds divine.  It makes chords nice and open and it is a blast to play with on the folk sound of the seagull, a nice mellow relaxed open sound.  Inspires my ears to make music.  Buy it.	1
This is a quality product as are most Kyser capos.  I purchased it in order to explore more 'open' tunings on the guitar.  There is limited instruction on the package, and limited information out on the web.  Other than that one has to experiment with applications for this capo.  I have not as yet explored youTube for help, but I expect there may be helpful videos out there.	1
great	1
Connected this drumstick bag to my big tom-tom and worked well allowing me to switch sticks, brushes and mallets with ease.	1
Great tool for guitarists. I own a music school and we purchased 6 of these for our rooms. They are made with a durable plastic and the winding mechanism hasn't broken in 3 years.	1
Does exactly what it is supposed to. No issues	1
Works great,great price !	1
never dropped a guitar with these.  i own 10 guitars.	1
I've used these strap locks on 5 guitars now. They hold great add give me the confidence to let go of my guitar and let it just hang off my shoulders when my hands are busy with peddles and knobs. Easy fast install.	1
They work as expected and don't make me worry about dropping expensive guitars. Make sure to carefully follow the instructions and lock everything into place before whirling your instrument around your back.	1
Works as it should. Nice.	1
These pots are well made and last a long time. I've tried other wah pots before and like the Hot Potz II and the Fulltone ICAR replica pot the best in terms of quality, reliability and sweep taper. More care needs to be taken when you solder the leads to the Hot Potz since the lugs are much smaller than those found on most other wah pots. As long as you are careful and don't over do it with the solder, you should be fine. Don't automatically assume that a botique pot that claims to be more authentic or "vintage" sounding than the stock Dunlop Hot Potz will automatically be an upgrade. You might be disappointed and end up putting the Hot Potz back in. I've done this before!	1
My old pot had gotten scratchy, so I de-soldered the three points and soldered this new one in. It works as it should with a nice smooth taper in my wah again.	1
AWESOME ROCK AWESOME ROCK AWESOME ROCK	1
easy to install. It cleaned up all the scratching in my wah pedal. Clear as a bell	1
my wah pedal that I got 20 years ago was making horrible sounds.  I replaced the pot and its perfect now.  Easily fix	1
This replaces the original Hot Potz in most Dunlop models.  The instructions were simple and easy to follow.  Done in a half hour, and it sounded wonderful.	1
Much larger than I thought they'd be. they are mostly likely perfect for what they are made for, too large for what I wanted to use them for.	1
Very nice bag.  Ordered it for storage for my grandson's drum sticks.	1
I've tried other strap locks along the way, but I always come back to these Dunlop models. They are simply the best. Very easy to install, and very easy to engage and disengage. If you really want strap locks for your instrument (and you DO), but these.	1
The cushions are not included which is a bog disappointment to me, the size of the screw are a joke.	-1
I've used Dunlop Straploks for almost 20 years. I have them on almost all of my guitars. I've never had one fail; even the oldest ones I have still look like new and work perfectly.  Tip: The screws are really long -- much longer than the ones on a regular strap button I highly recommend piloting the hole instead of just driving it in by brute force. Along those lines -- if you're putting one of these on the neck heel of an acoustic, you need to carefully measure the depth of the hole; a couple of times, I've had to cut the screw so that the tip didn't poke through the other side of the heel.	1
I love this strap.  I have never used a strap before when playing clarinet.  However, I needed to take the pressure off of my teeth (I have an issue with clarinet and my front teeth, but I am determined to play).  I read that this strap is not adjustable, but it is.  I am about 5'6 and I purchased the "regular" size.  I easily adjusted it to where it totally takes the pressure off, and there are several more inches it could shorten up still if I needed it to.  It is a thick, padded neck cushion, this strap is awesome.	1
I never thought I'd use one of these, but if you have any hand or wrist pain, try it!  It helps!  I don't have to use it every time I play, but it's great to have around when I need it!  It's easy to attach and great with the clarinet.	1
Missing a part..sent it back.  Looked really useful but, if it is missing parts, its not worth anything.  I will order another brand.	-1
Excellent product. Thanks Amazon.	1
Broke with first use. At least it was inexpensive.	-1
I ordered a black one, they sent a white version. Not worth the hassle of complaining. Works fine.	1
nice	1
Great bag .	1
works as it is supposed to	1
Works great	1
really, really useful. Only complaint is that it sometimes bumps against nearby pegheads if the guitar you're trying to string has pegs that are close to each other.	1
Use it!!!	1
Solid and works well.  Very kazooey.	1
I've used these for years and love them. New strap, new set. Look up a youtube video to explain how to put them on. Don't fight with it... just look up the video lol.	1
I've reviewed Dunlop's Dual Design locks on here already; love 'em, swear by 'em, using them on all my basses and guitars since 1992. These are pretty much just as good, just with a different looking strap button. I mainly needed another set of locks for a new strap, and these were a hair cheaper, and the Prime shipping got them here in 1 day.  I'm one of those guys who prefer Dunlops over Schallers. Schallers fall apart easier on stage (seen it happen too many times). Dunlops are more secure... may stick out a smidge more, but worth it. Plus as a Metallica fan growing up, I noticed James, Kirk, and Jason used them a lot which was a slam-dunk for me.  As far as the Dunlop straplocks, the coolest are the flushmount that require more drilling, Dual Design are the most common and have a really nice strapbutton, these (Traditional) are a little weird but also have a very usable strapbutton, and Original have the least usable strapbutton, and tend to wiggle too much if the strew in the guitar gets loose.	1
Had my first set of these 20 years ago, still the same, they just work.	1
Easy install. works great.	1
I've used this straplock set on two Fender Strats that i've owned and I will never purchase any other system for my guitars. I also have this set on my Fender Jazz bass. They are easy to install (a little longer and a little thicker than traditional strap screws on the Stratocaster), and once installed there is no issue.	1
I like this system a lot.  It's easy to install, required no drilling on either of my guitars or bass and works flawlessly.	1
Good fit, and finally one for lefties... I would recommend this product to those interested in a thumb pick - I give it a thumbs up. Is this enough words now?  Lol	1
As a lefty, my only option used to be purchasing right handed thumb picks and filing them to a lefty angle. No more! I did have to shape them a bit for comfort, length & angle refinement, but they work like a dream. Now I just need to find them in size XL.	1
The handle snapped off after only a few uses.	-1
This works perfectly well. Although it is made very cheaply, the price is obviously very economical. I've never had a problem using it, but would hesitate to have this as my only winder during a gig.	1
Is ok, good budget bag.	1
I love this Promark drumstick bag !!! This inexpensive, light weight bag has 6 inside pouches with room that I can easily store up to 13 full sized mallets, plus an outside pouch which can store up to 8 smaller [shorter sticked] mallets. The outside is made from stitched nylon and the inside is lined with a plastic material. After you insert the sticks there is even extra room at the top of the bag to put other small items [such as your wallet, a small datebook, etc.] . The metal zipper works easily and the bag has 2 handles - one standard strap on the outside plus a rope which you can use to carry it or attach it to a music stand for easy access to your mallets. Highly recommended !!!	1
a little flimsy in thickness but once you get it on the floor tom and tighten it up well then it just works perfect, have all kinds of sticks, malletts and brushes and it holds all items very well, tightly in place....you can't go wrong for the price.	1
Gets in what you need as an amateur drummer. Sturdy bag and quality.. Oh Yeah I am a sabian fan...	1
Plenty of space for what I need. It fits nicely on the floor tom for easy access to my sticks.	1
The reason I bought this bag over any other is strictly because it has a hook and string to connect it to your floor tom...  Why no other company has thought of this so far I will never know but thank you guys	1
I purchased this from a different store with a gift card. It lasted less than 10 string changes. The design could be easily remedied by using a metal shaft instead of a piece of plastic. After it broke, it took about 10 minutes for me to drill the hole out a little and then put a screw in there. Works fine now. If you are up for purchasing a thing that's going to last a few times and then spend a little time fixing it, then this is your product!	-1
A MUST HAVE IN YOUR GUITAR CASE .	1
Worked great!	1
It works like any other string winder.	1
No guitarist can do without a few of these	1
reliable	1
Works!	1
Overall excellent and satisfied!	1
Dunlop are the best... never had any of them fail on mr	1
These are great.  Two guitars and two straps and I can switch them in seconds.	1
lots of fun, sound is ok	1
eh.. only giving this 4 of 5... doesn't stay on tuners very good (sloppy) but I suppose they need to fit loose to accommodate various tuners.. also the 'handle' is suppose to spin, but it's pretty tight, so that makes it a little tough to crank round and round... for the price tho it beats all those turns with bare fingers on a string change.	1
Does the job of winding and unwinding my uke strings. That's enough for me.	1
does what it is supposed to do	1
I play this on my Selmer CL300. It sounds good. It is easy to play. This is a great improvement from the stock mouthpiece.	1
This is a very low price for a mountpiece. It may work for some folks, but I had to reface mine to get a clear sound from it.  However I am writing to warn about the cork on the tenon. It is too thick and trying to put the mouthpiece on as it is  might  either split the barrel or twist part of the key mechanism with your hands.. Do not force this mpc on your clarinet. Instead take some fine or medium grit emory paper and reduce the thickness of the cork by forming a circular place of paper that you smooth with thumb and forefinger  around the cork. This will take a few minutes. The mac should fit snugly, but not tightly. The  Forbes mac called "Debut" is much better value. It costs about $50 and you get a cover with it.	-1
Great product, great seller. Definitely recommended. Was a gift to the drummer in the band. Makes it easier to carry sticks around. Something every drummer should have.	1
I didn't like these, because I don't like thumbpicks and I was trying them again. THese are PERFECT lefty thumbpicks. I have medium sized thumbs for a man and these fit well. Good finishing. I just prefer greatly to play barefingered.	1
I Am A Guitar Master & These Lefty Thumb Picks Are Getting Rare & Are King For Fat Sound !!!!	1
Perfect for a lefty.	1
These are the best. My guitar teacher John, said the same. Got these in lefty too.	1
It gets the job done!	1
It does the job!	1
It's smaller than I expected which is a plus. Easy to carry around. And very good quality. Once you go Dunlop you won't go back. Dunlop rocks!	1
This tool is handy and couldn't be simpler. Next time, though, I will buy the one with the little string snipper built in, so i don't have to get my wire cutters out in addition to the stringwinder every time i want to change a string.	1
It broke the first time I used it. what a piece of junk. Really, stay away from this. It's a scam. Faulty by desing, a very thin plastic part is supposed to support all the effort, and it obviously breaks. I really hate this thing.	-1
I'll never trust any other straplock system to securely hold my instruments. These are great! install is very easy, as is affixing the holder to the strap. Can't be beat!	1
These are my favorite strap locks!	1
I have these on all my guitars and basses. I think they are a superior design to the Schaller ones as you can remove the strap with one hand just by pressing in. Some strap locks require two hands.  There is one consistent problem...the screws they give you are TERRIBLE and strip out VERY easily. Do not use the provided screws. There is nothing worse than having one strip out on you half way in, this has happened to me twice.	1
These work great. Bought multi sets for interchanging strap with my guitars.  Clean and neat fit onto strap and guitar	1
As advertised! Works perfectly	1
a tight fit for our clarinet but it works.	1
I have ordered/used 2 of these mouthpieces, one for myself and a replacement for my son.  There is a huge sound difference and it is worth the money you pay for it.  Excellent sound quality.  We use it on a Buffet B12 clarinet and it only makes it sound better.	1
great kazoo for such a low price	1
I've bought a few of these.  One for the truck, one for my guitar case, one for the fiddle case, one for the purse.  I love my kazoos.	1
It works fine.	1
The greatest few dollars you can spend when changing strings	1
love this thing, make changing strings easy and fast.	1
Strongly built quality guitar string winder. Compact in size so it fits perfectly in my already crammed guitar case. A must have for guitar enthusiasts.	1
I've been using these for years.. expect I will be using them for years more.. :)	1
Great straplock ! Haven't had a strap issue since it was installed	1
Peg winders are alot like wet personal wipes, sugar and condoms...you don't think of (or appreciate) them at all until you really, really need them. Stuck on the terlet with no wet wipes (are there still savages using dry toilet paper in 2016!). About to tuck into your tea but don't have sugar. About to slide into homebase but your lady insists on you using a raincoat, which of course you don't have...all of these are bad news.  But alas they pale next to changing strings on a guitar without a peg winder. Don't let it happen to you...	1
It works	1
Save your fingers, buy a string winder ! I've used this twice and it works perfectly. I expect to be using it for years.	1
I purchased this mouthpiece for my daughter who wanted to try to learn to play the clarinet I had when I was in school. The mouthpiece on my clarinet was intended for more advanced users and she could barely make a sound.  So, for no more than this mouthpiece cost, It was a no-brainer to get one that would work better for her.  It is much easier for her to use and would make a good mouthpiece for a beginner.  It has fairly good tone for a  plastic mouthpiece and seems to be of good construction.	1
The sound was great. My toddler loved it. The reason for low stars is that the paint chipped off like crazy and we didn't realize till a while after it has happen. So my child was basically consuming metallic paint chips (that likely contained lead, being a product of China). For $8 I would expect more. Would NOT recommend this for children.	-1
Live them.	1
What can I saw that hasn't been said already.  This is just a rock solid performer and I have them on all my guitars.	1
Dunlop Straploks are bar none the best strap locking system on the market.	1
Work well!	1
A++ No problems!	1
Worked as promised.	1
Don't let the weaky feel fool you, this cuts string change time by like a thousand percent. Pin puller was used for the first time yesterday. I am sad when I can't find it.	1
Works !!	1
Excellent	1
Not much to say here, solid tool that does what its supposed too.	1
Did not work very well on bass guitar,  had to modify it to get it to work.	-1
No	1
Real nice. No more neck aches. I can play for a few hours (as long as my lip holds up). I am 5'11". Regular size just barely works for me.	1
I myself am not a musician but my Son is and he said this is a decent clarinet mouthpiece and well worth the cost.  Barry Peralta	1
Good Product	1
These do the job. They are a little complicated if you are not handy and cant read or follow directions. Only issue I had was fitting them to a leather strap. If your going with a strap with a typical end, it should be fine. If its a leather strap it may be too thick I got mine to work with some force, did scratch the finish, but hey.. It does the job.	1
Perfect!	1
I bought these because my Fender strap locks sucked, and even though these are a bit hard to get on the strap (PLIERS HELP) these are really good. The strap comes on and off easily when you want it to, but when it's locked in, it STAYS.	1
Got it for my Fender 5 string Jazz bass, never will fall off	1
I get all wound up just thinking about this.	1
simple and functional.  What else could you ask for?	1
With this you can save a lot of time when changing the strings of your guitar!	1
A little cheap, and they feel it, but it does what it is supposed to.	1
I can not use this harness in a professional manner. It is cheaply made and very uncomfortable. It may be suitable for a high school marching band member and that is who I will donate it too. The service was great and it is just cheaply made	-1
As advertised. love it.	1
Had to wait and add it to an order but other than that it works good and saves time.	1
Thought it was a good deal but after a few winds the axel snapped. This is a total P.O.S.	-1
You have to have one of these cheap things if you have a guitar.  Makes changing strings far easier, both for winding and for removing the bridge pins.	1
My favorite strap locks.	1
The best out there. I have them on every guitar I gig with. I don't feel safe without them.	1
Great idea!  Just get the color that matches your guitar.  Don't over tighten the screws.  This is a great product. I'll say the same thing for the black version of these Straploks (sic)...	1
Works well.  Only issue is with handle is stiff and needs to be looser.  Also it does not clear the other keys well.  needs to be a little taller.	1
Very simple and low cost tool, but it works great and makes it so much easier to put on a new set of strings. Highly recommended.	1
How you can go wrong with this?	1
It's a faster way to change your strings that's for sure, but it feels a little cheap, it was like 2$ though so that's as expected, I recommend it if you have multiple guitars to preform string changes on, or just want a faster way to do it	1
Uncomfortable and always loosening itself. Would not get again.	-1
The best I ever used! Really love it, it has no compare!	1
It is a life saver. After visiting a chiropractor for my wrist, he became obsessed with my neck. I have a bulging cervical vertebrae exactly where a neck strap goes. After a Fall of college marching band I decided I needed to upgrade to a decent harness. I have not tried any others, but for tenor this fits perfectly for me. It is so comfortable, especially if you have a collared shirt. The stitching can be somewhat abrasive if you are moving a lot while playing, and horn moves are really restricted. But, if you are using it for a concert setting, it is perfect. Wearing it under a blazer hides it well, and the only real negative about it is the price, but it is worth it.	1
I have Dunlap straploks on every bass!  Craig	1
Works well on my Gibson Les Paul Studio Deluxe II.	1
Very useful accessories.	1
Been using those strapless forever - the best ones out there!	1
Bottom line, they work. I do feel like there's either an extra piece in the package or I did not put them together properly. They rattle around a little more than I'd like but they function like they should.	1
Good size to keep in a small bag to travel with. Helps make unwinding the strings to change them a lot easier than to do it manually.	1
Peg quality is impeccable. Velvet covering prevents the inner tube of one's precious flute from getting scratched as it is inserted onto the stand. 110% Functional.  I have purchased two of these - Hercules DS502B Flute/Clarinetinet PEGs ...  - one to replace the plastic one which came with my cast iron flute stand base (On-Stage Stands Clarinet or Flute Stand).  The incumbent plastic peg had some rough edges which scratched (once) the inner tube of my old flute.  - the second Peg is used to construct a homemade flute stand using a sturdy wooden base. A great ready made spare part to use in these projects.  Highly Recommended.	1
Because I'm a "doubler" I need flexibility.  I've used this peg with clarinet, flute, and oboe.  I especially like the felt-like exterior and the solid feel of the base into which they go.	1
I really like the harness for Tenor and larger saxes to keep the pressure off my neck. However, I am over 6 feet tall and this one is not suitable for a tenor sax as it is too long. the measurements given are best suited for the type of saxophone but not clear in the description. This one is better suited to a Baritone or Bass Sax. You have to try them on and see what works for you. If you have extra money check out the Vandoren Harness. I will be giving it a try as well.	1
It makes stringing your guitar a breeze.	1
I got this because I was told it would make guitar string winding easier. Completely true I have never strung a guitar until today, and I could not have done it without this. I will say the package looks like it was printed in the 80's and the package was old. But that only makes it that much cooler. The only reason I knocked 1 star is due to the crank portion which has a lot more friction than I would like, nothing a little lube won't fix.	1
Works just fine.	1
Updated review: wow, I've never had a tuning wrench break on me second time used. Problem here seems to be the plastic that holds the handle to the axel. Just cracked and flew apart. Cannot recommend this one at all.	-1
If you're looking to secure your guitar this is the product you need ....	1
This works well and makes adding and removing a strap on my banjo an easy, two second process.  I replaced one of the wood screws with a nut and bolt to attach one of the buttons to my banjo's rim.  I plan to add this system to my other banjos, too.  Extra buttons are available to use on other instruments, although it is just about as expensive to buy a whole set as the two extra buttons.	1
Works	1
These picks are great! Easy to grip, just the right thickness, and they produce killer tones!	1
I have settled on these when playing my electrics. Seems to be just the right thickness. Combined with the Monster Grips, I have finally found a winning combination. That said, I own alot of different brands and thicknesses of picks	1
great picks, the thickness is just right. the matte finish makes it comfortable to hold, not slippery at all.	1
For some reason these are thicker than my other .60mm picks but still good quality.	1
So i play the baritone sax and have been using the old neck straps for quite some time and it really messed with my neck. I bought this to help play longer and be more comfortable with my berry. Instead of it all on your neck its spread out around your back and it makes a hell of a difference. If you play a bigger instrument as maybe the tenor or alto(pretty light you could stick to a neck strap) then i would recommend this to anyone.	1
This is our third one of these.  The hook could be a little more sturdy, and the latch part broke on our first one, but the harness is very comfortable for my son.  He has a junker bari at school for marching band, and a professional bari at home for all of his other stuff - so that's why we're on our third order of these.  (The hook broke on the first one after about 1 1/2 years of very heavy use.)  We will stay with this brand.  Neotech products are great.	1
The other Harness, (same company, Neotech) is much better, puts all the weight of my sax on my shoulders, this harness (Super harness) hurts my neck.	-1
its not anything special, just a simple string winder. it does its job.	1
Perfect, makes it so much easier!	1
works. Real handy.	1
Super satisfying plectrums. These Tortex are my favorite just remember to empty your pockets before you find a handful of these bad boys in your lint trap!	1
Great product!!!!!!!!	1
Great Picks better than the Picks of Destiny by Clayton.	1
Great product, works like a charm. Does a good job of securing a heavy guitar.	1
Installed on a friends Ibanez 6 string Electric Bass. It works very well.	1
i simply  love them	1
I can't even remember how many sets of these I have bought or installed. This brand is my favorite, easiest to use, I have tied other brands and they work pretty good but these are the best I have found..I have well over 10 different Guitar Straps, all have the Male part installed so I can do a change quickly..	1
I love the security and ease-of-use of Dunlop Straploks, although you should be aware that the strap buttons--even the "dual design" ones--are much larger than the stock strap buttons on most guitars. The "flush mount" buttons are an interesting option, but they require a little more drilling than I'm comfortable with!	1
well these are the best invention since the strap...they should be on every guitar...	1
Great for tenor banjo (CGDA) - just enough thickness to get a nice clear tone, and the slight texture helps my grip as an intermediate flatpicker.	1
Can't go wrong with Jim Dunlop...	1
Great pics. What else can I say. I keep buying them. Over and over again. They have become "my thing".	1
Confession time, only one of my guitars is pitch black, but I use these Pitch Black Guitar Picks with my red, blue, green and silver guitars too. They work great, they make the strings vibrate, they let you scratch that weird itchy spot behind my right ear, and even work as a giant black colored buck tooth when you want to annoy your bass player.	1
Great  products!  I absolutely love Jim Dunlop products! This one works like a charm too! Highly recommend this product to all who re-string their guitars.	1
I love this - we have ordered several of these & they work perfectly.	1
Excellent for the price, does the job.	1
Works Great. A Must Have To Use While Installing My Strings. Smooth Operation.	1
Great item and great price	1
Very comfortable to play. Love the black color.	1
Thanks!	1
You've gotta love Dunlop Tortex picks. Your mileage will vary on pick thickness. I rarely use .73 but that is for you to decide.	1
The dunlop tortex pics don't slip and they hold up long term, i wouldnt use anything else.	1
Bought a 3rd set of these recently, for a 3rd guitar. The first set i bought is still in use 4 years after i installed, still in good shape. The only issue i've had with that set is that twice ( over a 4-year time span ) i've had to put a drop of oil or two on them to stop squeaks. They've held a Les Paul securely, through several hundreds of hours of use. An added bonus is that they are minimally protruding, so that i can just leave the strap attached when i have the guitar in its "model-specific" plush-lined hard case. It's easy enough to "unplug" them if needed, but i haven't once had any of them accidentally detach, or fail.	1
Awesome straplok system.  the only thing I don't like is the length of the screws on some of my guitars,  I used the original screws that I removed  and I am very happy.  I have these on 6 guitars and I would recommend for everyone with a Guitar you don't want to see hit the ground due to a strap coming off.	1
Works great!	1
Flimsy.  Very flimsy and cheap.	-1
Simple and effective	1
Love em!	1
This is my soft spot in terms of pick thickness; usual Dunlop Tortex grip, which I love.	1
Been my go to for 25 years!	1
Hard to see on the stage. So I reverted back to the yellow Tortex for stage use in case I drop them.	1
I have been using the 73mm yellows from Dunlop for years and now I found them in black. The same great feel, but way more METAL! ; D  \m/	1
only straploks i use.	1
excellent, use them on all my guitars	1
Perfect fit and so easy to install.  I always get these for new instruments!	1
I think these are the best straplocks available. I use them on my RG7421 and My Les Paul. I would feel comfortable hanging off a cliff by one of these locks, and that is no exaggeration.	1
works well	1
Great seller delivered as expected,I will order from them again!***** Great product as expected.	1
Pretty lovely and absolutely necessary plastic contraption for every guitar player. I use it for a few days and now cannot imagine how I lived a life without it.. Came in nice wrap. Decent made and works perfect so far!	1
This is one of many I have purchased over the years.  It is essential to anyone changing guitar strings on a regular basis as it speeds the winding process significantly.  I would recommend buying more than one, as they are popular walk-off items.  Great product, and great price.  Highly recommend!	1
way faster to string and unstring my guitar by using this string winder than just with my fingers.	1
great picks, great price, great shipping, what more do you want..?	1
Can't beat the price or the shipping!  Great picks!	1
Very nice soft grip.	1
Cool little additions to a guitar. Easy install and so far, flawless functionality.	1
A must have. These are the best straplocks available.	1
I am using them for years, and never had any issues	1
very nice. Product exactly as advertised	1
This kit contains the essentials for proper sax care. Good for students as well as pros. Essential in the care of your instrument. I recomend this to any musician.	1
these string winders are very handy when changing strings and there very simple to use.	1
does the job	1
This is the best metronome hands down, I have been using it with my students for over 5 years. However, i refuse to pay more than $40 for it as it has been offered previously for $38. The company(ies) selling it for $50+  are price gouging because this met. has become hard to find for its popularity. When the price comes back down, I'll begin buying it again.  As far as functionality and durability, perfect combination. I also find the click sound to be better than the beeps of other electronic metronomes. The students respond better and it's not as annoying. The volume control is wonderful, gets very loud - a plus when working with young kids, since they usually play loud naturally. The beat subdivision is also hard to come by but a great addition to this met. Some students struggle with eighth notes and the beat subdivision works like a charm. Among other benefits for the other beat subdivisions included.	1
This is an excellent metronome.  To me the sound in terms of tone and volume available is perfect.  It has a good range of tempo and some great features.  My only question is build quality.  The stand is flimsy and when put into position has to be shoved in.  I may be wrong, but I can't see that surviving with younger music students and may even break, in too soon a time, for anyone.  Of course you can just not use the stand, which is my choice.  The buttons also seem flimsy.  So the 4 star rating is based on a perceived lack of build quality, however in terms of quality for actually doing what it is purchased for and working properly, I could easily give it 5 stars.	1
Great Picks!	1
Great Picks!	1
My absolute favorite picks. I love both the .88 for guitar and the 1mm for bass. Great sound and great texture on them. They feel smooth but don't drop everywhere when your hands sweat.	1
Great picks for a beginner.	1
Great picks, seem to last longer that the regular yellow ones.	1
My all around favorite pick.  I like different ones for different guitars but the Pitch Black .73 is the one I would choose to be stranded on a deserted island with (assuming my guitars, amps, and plenty of electrical outlets were there too).  Works well with everything I play!	1
Solid, Flawless and So secure. I regret not buying this so long time ago. Installed on Gibson les paul studio.	1
Couldn't have been any easier to install. Remove your old strap pegs, install the strap lock receivers. The "male" locking mechanism installs on your strap. Snap it in to lock, push button and pull to remove. The only drawback is; if you're one that likes using a variety of straps, it would be a little time consuming and not worth the effort (to me, anyway) to change the locking mechanism to a different strap if done on a regular basis.	1
Personally, I think these things are just brilliant!  I've used Schaller's in the past and in general, love Schaller gear (particularly their tuners and bass bridges), however in this case I do actually prefer the Dunlaps.  The main reasons are 1.) Ease of use and 2.) More compatible with regular straps.  Since I've seen a couple of comments regarding this, I'd like to take a second here and talk about the installation.  First and foremost, please be aware that you should probably use a degree of common sense when installing these!  The screws for the strap pegs are a bit larger than most average size (guitar peg) screws...I suspect this is intentional on the part of Dunlap so as to more securely hold the instrument.  As such, you may very well need to drill out your existing peg holes just a bit, otherwise you may find yourself really torquing down on the screw driver.  This shouldn't be a big deal, however some folks do seem to over-look it.  Likewise, as someone else mentioned, if you are using these on something with a less than traditional design, such as an Ovation with a fiber/carbon/composite bowl, you may need to improvise just a bit....I would not expect these fairly traditional wood screws to work easily with an aluminum or acrylic body either without some degree of modification.  Likewise, as some folks have already mentioned, the locks themselves...the part that goes on your strap ends...does tend to have a rather snug fit, particularly with thicker straps.  With one of my nice leather straps, yea...it took some "patience" to get that clip on there.  That said, at this point I have installed 5 or 6 sets of these and I have NOT had to "beat the sh_t out of it" as one reviewer suggested.  Again I would suggest a degree of common sense here...these are designed for a fairly average strap thickness, so if your strap ends are exceptionally thick (such as a heavy leather), you may very well need to fudge with it just a bit or simply use them with a different strap.  In short, guitars aren't really "one size fits all", so there's no reason to assume that something such as a strap locking system should be.  Again please use some common sense and adjust to your own situation accordingly and if you're not competent or comfortable using basic hand tools, please refer the installation to a set up pro!  Now to get back to my initial comment up there, I do actually prefer these over the Schallers.  I've used the Schallers in the past and wouldn't hesitate to use them again, however I found the Dunlaps much easier to use...button on, button off...they really are THAT simple to use (as apposed to having to pull and fudge with that little knob on the Schallers).  I also like that the Dunlaps use a much more traditional strap peg design as compared to the Schallers.  I'll admit it...I can be a forgetful ol' fart sometimes and there have been one or two occasions where I forgot to toss my strap in my case before heading out the door.  While the Schaller's have a MUCH more rounded design, allowing a regular strap to slip off MUCH easier, with the Dunlaps I can simply borrow a strap from someone and I'm still good to go for the night...unlike the Schallers, the Dunlap strap pegs hold the strap as securely as a traditional strap peg would.  I also find that the larger washer and mount of the Dunlaps tend to hold the strap ends MUCH more secure than the Schaller's do with the smaller nut and washer design (when I still used the Schallers, I always replaced those stock washers with larger fender washers so as to get a better bite on the strap end).  If I really have any little niggle about these at all, it's simply that you can't purchase the strap pegs separately.  As a person who has around a dozen or so guitars that I use regularly (with more than 30 in the collection as of this writing),  I really only have 3 or 4 straps that I typically use.  It would be nice if I could use those straps on ANY of the guitars withOUT having to buy the full strap lock set.  Regardless of which brand you choose, as a person who has indeed dropped a guitar or two on his foot over the years, I feel that strap locks are nearly as essential as a good guitar tuner...I really can't see going on stage without them!  Definitely a worthwhile investment!	1
Straplock system maakes securing guitar fast, easy and convenient.  Absolutely recommended.	1
Excelente producto!	1
perfect	1
makes it so much easier to chang your strings and alot faster too.	1
An excellent tool	1
It does what it is supposed to do. It was also very handy when restringing my acoustic. Don't get caught up in paying 2 or 3 times more for a "fancy" string wonder. They all do the same thing and this is no exception.	1
...and found out I can use it on by girlfriend too.	1
exactly what i ordered basic string winder	1
The almost very best in my unending quest for the perfect pick... How can such a little plastic thing be so hard to find? Well, this is as close to hitting the holy grail as you'll come. I know, everybody's different, but start here and make this your pick to knock off the top of the heap. Would prefer a better more visible color so when it hits the floor, you can find it without missing 4 beats.	1
Nice picks!	1
I needed a new pick as the one I had been using was slipping and moving around as I played. After reading some reviews on Amazon about this pick I decided to give it a try, glad I did. There is some kind of coating on it that really locks it in place and prevents the 'travel' my other pick were doing. It stays right where I put it... so far I've only tried the .88 thickness, but I have the .73 on order as well and will review that once I have a chance to play with it some - I expect the same results so if my review for that one is similar - that's why, only so much you can write about a guitar pick after all.	1
I normally play with the Orange 0.60 Dunlaps but recently picked up a pack of these. They are just as good but a nice flat black color. Here what I said about the Orange ones: I've been playing acoustic and electric guitar for 30 years and I've tried just about every pick out there. If you pay chords or lead or flat-picking style, these are the ones to get. Flexible enough to give you that snap just be prepared to replace them after every gig	1
Works perfectly	1
A must to change strings....makes the job so much easier	1
I just got this for Xmas and it works very well by the way	1
I went 20 years without one of these. This has changed my life.  Works great.	1
These are made of strong materials (weight tested to 800 lbs!), easy to install, and look great!  They're simple to unhinge, so you can switch straps to other guitars that you've also installed the Straplok system on, but they hold on tight when you don't want them to slip.  The only issue I have, if any, is that they hold the strap out about a quarter inch from the body, so it looks a little strange.  Still, it allows the straps to free swing without any worries that they'll come undone.  These can save your guitar and your toes!	1
It's from Jim Dunlop, so they are great !!!	1
All I use!!!	1
This is amazing for my strap	1
These locks are low-profile, durable, and very easy to put on and use. I prefer them over any other strap locks. These are a must for live performances.	1
I just received this metronome and I've already fallen in love with it. Now that I have a volume control, I wonder why any metronomes are made without this simple feature. It is so nice to have the volume low while practicing soft passages, or even while playing scales and arpeggios as some metronomes are much louder than needed. Its top volume is louder than any metronome I've ever heard. I also like the pendulum feature, it's more dynamic than other metronomes and allows me to feel the pulse all the way through the beats, if that makes any sense. The main reason I purchased this was the 40 note tone generator, which the volume dial also controls. I've been wanting a drone sound to play as I work on difficult passages as a reference point to hear if all notes are in tune. This does that job very well, especially since I can turn the tone volume way down. Excellent item, I think I'll buy another...	1
I really liked this updated model of Wittner's fine metronomes. My music instructor approved as well! Seems well constructed for a delicate instrument and I really would not be surprised if it lasts decades as my old classic mechanical Wittner did. No problems with stand or anything, but I just set it on my music stand which I use for keyboard and violin.  Adjustable volume with classic wood block & chime sound, nice!  Flashy LED visual indicator as well.  Toss in violin case when done, no need to wait for wind-down. Good German Made Product!	1
good med/hard pics...	1
As Advertised,Fast Delivery,No Problems	1
Great!	1
nice feel and firmness.  Don't know how the will wear yet but I like these a lot.	1
Great product at a great price! I'd order again in a heartbeat!	1
great for speed chords.	1
The visual arc emulating the the pendulum on a wooden metronome is very helpful. The ability to pre-set the timing before you turn the metronome on is a great feature. Most of the other digital metronomes lose their count once they've been turned off, so you have to re-set the timing by tediously pressing and holding a button until the correct count reaches the count your want. Another great feature is that it has settings for counting out different timings like triplets and swing 1/8 notes. There are more features, but I'm not going over all of them. Obviously, I think this metronome is great. Very highly recommended!!!!!!	1
Have not used this product yet, but thought I would review it anyway. Because so far just in trying it, it does as they say. I hope it is durable and lasts a long time. I will use it to get my timing down as I play to keep rythm. This old tired hands move slow at times and speed up sometimes...so getting that timing down is a must for me, this product will I hope get those issues solved soon enough.	1
i really like these...use with thick walker williams straps and evernthough they are thick straps they are soft enough to get these on..  the washer that goes on the strap is extremely thick and you have to fight it...but once you got it its a fine product..enjoy	1
I've used this product before.  I knew how well they worked, so it was not a problem to order them, again.	1
I buy Dunlop locks pedals straps they all are top quality and I love them all. you need a strap strap locks or pedals buy dunlop	1
These are definitely my favorite strap locks there are plenty out there but these ones are mine I've always been a huge fan of Jim Dunlop products and will continue using them for years to come	1
Perfect for my Fender Strat Guitar! No problems, the screws are a little tighter on the guitar but they went in tightly though. Very happy with these Straplocks.	1
great price,easy to use.	1
Bought this to replace another brand with clippers etc., like these better - just simple and works as I like it to..... easy!!	1
This item is NOT I am expecting because when I use it to TUNE my Electric Guitar,, it MOVE and NOT THAT STABLE. So I just put it aside and tune my guitar with my finger as as before that is why I rated this item 1-STAR. I don't recommend this product to a friend,,, it a garbage for me, although it is CHEAP,,, SORRY ABOUT THAT,,, Next time I'll buy an expensive stringwinder......	-1
.88 is my number. The correct gauge for how I play. These are wonderful guitar picks. Reasonably priced too.	1
I've always used bright picks in the past.  But with a really fancy guitar and a black headstock, I don't want to see the bright picks against my gorgeous guitar.  The black blends in with the headstock color and is not so easy to see by your audience if you store your spare picks on your guitar neck headstock, like I do.	1
This is the same as the standard. 88mm green Tortex standard picks. That's not a bad thing, but these black ones cost more. I bought this 12 pack to complete the $35 requirement for Prime one day shipping. Otherwise, I just get the standard green ones.	1
These work perfect.	1
This picks are almost identical to their colored-version counterparts. They hold up nicely and the design doesn't fade like the colored ones. They look and play great!	1
Great pick for a beginner.	1
I found this strap too short to fit on classical guitars, the claw too big to use on ukuleles, and the strap too wide to use around the neck. Its well made, and the knitting gives it a unique appearance, but I would not use this for extended periods of time.	-1
So, it took me a little while to figure out that the strap has to wrap around the bottom of the instrument.  I use this for my ukulele and the result is satisfactory. The only downside for me is that the material is a bit itchy.	1
My favorite picks. Price is right	1
These are great.  Kinda feel like the yellow Dunlop Tortex picks, except a cooler black color.	1
Great picks. No moving parts : )	1
love these pics	1
These are just great. I'll never buy any picks but these. They hold up well, they're easily to hold for long sessions, and they come sharp. No complaints.	1
My perfect pick	1
I got this because I was too lazy to turn the stringing knobs by hand. This works perfectly. The peg remover is also very handy, as those pegs are pretty hard to ge out.	1
It's an industry standard that everyone should have in their guitar case or gig bag: the Dunlop String Winder.  There's no need for quoting specs, or talking about construction with this review; it's as simple as it gets.  Put the winder on your tuning key and CRANK.  Makes string changes a breeze, especially if you use locking tuners.	1
It costs 10 bucks at a BnM store to change your strings. Why not do research and pick one of these up? They aren't even 2 dollars. Come on, not even a pack of strings.	1
This system does not fail. Install it and you never have to worry about it again. Although it's a good idea to lube up bearings every once in a while. I put these on all of my guitars!	1
Do not hesitate to use the Dunlop Straplok system. I have been using them on my guitars for years and see no need to change now,.	1
Found that other strap locks - you know the brand...well after a while the latch that goes over the button wears the plating off and then makes creaking sounds and metal against metal....hate that sound honestly. These the pin goes into button and the bearings don't have the same contact space to uh "creak"....	1
I use these on all my guitars.  Love them.  Easy to assemble and use.  If you have trouble putting it on your strap google for some videos showing you how to use a pliers to push the clip on.  Once installed they are fantastic.	1
Here's what strap locks are supposed to do: securely attach your strap to your guitar. These do that much better than Schallers and the Fender rip-offs of Schaller. I used the Schallers many years ago. They look great, but the problem is they screw onto the strap with a nut. I am very good with maintenance, check for loose parts, etc., but at one gig with my super heavy American deluxe 5 string jazz bass, the nut worked its way off the strap, and I dropped it. It was with a heavy leather strap, and I did tighten it down with pliers upon installation and I'm sure I kept it maintained. Absolutely ridiculous and inexcusable. Never again. Unless you want to inspect and retighten your strap locks at every single rehearsal and gig, forget about Schallers. They're a good company and they make great tuners, I don't fault the materials, it's simply that threaded things can work their way loose, a fatal design flaw for this type of device. Come on, its only purpose is to not allow something to come off of something else. The Dunlop strap locks fit on with a locking ring. It is impossible to remove these from the strap by accident. If you're having trouble getting the lockrings on, I have a YouTube video posted to my channel, NickWeissMusic, just search for Dunlop strap lock installation. It's kind of tough at first but with experience, it's very easy. The package instructions are correct but not very helpful. I have these on more than 10 instruments, and have never had even close to a failure in well over a decade. The package recommends periodically lubricating the mechanism inside the lock, but I have never done so, in my experience lubricants usually gunk things up more than they help for things like this. I've never had so much as a grind or squeak from the button or ball bearings in these strap locks, if I did, I'd probably just replace it. I do give the locks a little tug when I put them on to make sure they're engaged, other than that, you can forget about them, which is the way it should be. The only possible downside is that these strap locks keep the strap a little further from the instrument then using no strap locks or the Schallers do, to which I say, who cares. Well, I guess a lot of people care about that, since I see it in a lot of reviews. If using no strap lock or a poorly designed one is worth it to you, just so you can have your strap a quarter inch closer to your guitar, so be it. I have seen Ernie Ball strap locks that seem to be a little lower profile, I think they use lock rings too. Maybe try those, but I'm sticking with the flawless track record of the Dunlops.	1
A definite guitar saver. I wish they would sell just the strap pieces by themselves. I've got them on all my guitars but hate having to buy the set every time I find a new strap I want to use.	1
Easy to put on and looks well made.  I'll look to add these to some of my other guitars soon.	1
Lets face it, in general string winders are pretty much all the same right? WRONG! I went with this one because I trusted the Dunlop name. What a let down. on the second guitar I used it on the handle and the head separated, sure you can press it back together, but after separating several times on every string, it gets a little old....quick. Already ordered a different one to replace it. One thing I cant stand is inferior tools.	-1
If your in a hurry these are the way to go.  I have used my fingers for the last 25 years and with this tool, the cramping goes away.	1
Pretty simple tool, did exactly what I needed it to for a decent price. I'd order again if I needed another one!	1
I can't believe I waited almost 20 years to get one of these.  I have been restringing my guitar by hand for that long.  I think I may of had one but just didn't realize the importance of it.  Same with tube amps.  I had tube amps back then and never thought of swapping tubes or even putting new pickups in my guitar.  I knew about the stuff it just wasn't a priority.  Man I have grown in wisdom.  I love music.	1
Nice to use and easy and smooth in putting the guitar strings on place on the guitar - very easy	1
Jim Dunlop has produced these for more years than I'd like to admit to personal knowledge.  As long as I can remember, I've had one in my case and one on the workbench.  There are dozens of wannabe models, but none are as genuinely authentic as good ol' Jim Dunlop's.  I gotta remember not to get the black ones, though.  I seem to lose them to easily - or maybe they are really that good, and they just get 'borrowed'.	1
The alternative to wearing out your fingers tuning your guitar. Especially good for you beginners who get frustrated tuning your instrument	1
These are exactly the same as the green .88mm tortex picks only in the pitch black color.  Creates a nice variety on my pick holder.	1
excellent	1
great feel	1
Now I know why Willie Nelson use's one. Steady, easy on/off and make's playing a real joy. I Love Mine. Got Lucky and got a really nice Blue one. No Regrets here !!!!!!	1
A simple device, yet so useful.  I hate changing strings without one, anymore.  Dunlop provided an inexpensive winder that's durable.	1
I hate winding strings. I got this to help with that. It does it job very well. You can string your guitar in a fraction of the time. It could be a little tougher but as long you don't give it hell it will be fine. Great and cheap product!	1
Great	1
Perfect thickness for a guitar pick, in my opinion.  Not too thick like their heavy duty guage, and not flimsy like a think pick at all. I got a 12 pack and 2 picks will probably last me 6 months that's how good these are!	1
lml	1
.88 Tortex picks are great. They're stiff but still a bit flexible. And these are black, which makes them better.	1
Okay everyone should know by now, tortex picks are some of the best you can buy. They aren't flashy or unique, but they have a subtle elegance in the way they play and they last much longer than a lot of other picks (if you don't lose them like me)	1
Too clicky. Not quite what I was looking for.	-1
Last so much longer than my fender picks	1
dunlop tortex have been the best pick ive ever used....and now that i found the pitch black instead of all the rediculous colors i love them even more	1
I really like the texture these have. Amazon has unbeatable pricing!	1
I bought this cause i needed something to easily change the strings on my guitars. This thing works great. For the price you can't beat it. Maybe one day I might get the powered one but until then this thing will do. Fits in your pocket, gig bag, etc. So you can have this thing on the go. Works great and you can't beat the price.	1
And that's all I've got to say about it. It hasn't stuck, broken, or slipped in any of the string-changes I've used it for. Costs a little extra, but well worth that price. You'll need a new one about every ten years or so.	1
Ok its cheap. You knew that when you bought it. I really thought it was going to be more then one since it said assorted and showed a few in the picture. It was only one and it was red. Broke with first use.	-1
Although not the best Capo, It is a good resolve for those who do not have one, Not the best though	1
Long lasting, VERY stiff, little wear or dust, tough as nails. The pretty silver stamping wears off kinda fast, but such is life.	1
I used these babies heavily until I found the BlueChip pick, now I'll never go back.  If you can't afford the BlueChip (average of $35 & up) then these are the picks to have.  I prefer the D'Andrea Pro Plec picks for tone, but they don't have enough volume for standing out when you're jamming with other instruments.  These, oddly enough, also have a completely differentand much bettertone than their purple counterparts.  I honestly think the material is different.  Either way, the black 1.14mm Tortex picks from Dunlop have the perfect balance of deep tones mixed with the treble sounds you need when it comes your time for a solo break on Acoustic guitar, especially Bluegrass, my specialty.  Highly recommended.	1
I love these picks and the .88mm seems to be the perfect balance of stiffness and suppleness for my playing.	1
I've been using Dunlop .88's for almost 20 years. They're my favorite picks. These are JUST like the green dunlop .88's, but they're black. They hold up, they have a good response (for my purposes at least), and they're at a good price point. Go for it -- you know you want some tough-guy black picks in your case.	1
favorites ones by far.  i used to like the dunlop grey nylon (.60) but they are too floppy.  i like these better.	1
Dunlop makes excellent picks. They are really all I use anymore. I generally use the yellow .88s. When I saw that these were the same in black, I had to order them. I love them and I use them, but they are slightly thicker than .88s. They aren't close to .96mms, but they are slightly less bendable than their yellow counterparts. I took off one star for that, because someone might not be very happy with this fact. All in all, great picks. One pack would probably last you for years if we didn't lose picks all the time.	1
These are my favorite picks to play with.  The Dunlop Tortex Picks have such a nice warm sound on acoustic.	1
this is a fun way to capo your guitar.  Not the easiest but it gets the job done in what seems to be a more real way	1
This capo is a great, and better looking, alternative to the more expensive "regular" capos. The only downside is that it is elastic and will eventually wear out, to the point that it can't do its job. However, they did account for this the best they could. There are 3 grommets on it, so as soon as it isn't tight enough on the first one,  you can just stretch it a little further to the 2nd one and you're good to go for another few months, and likewise with the 3rd grommet.  I don't use a capo all that often, but for me, it lasted about a year before I had to order a new one, which I am perfectly fine with because I like the way it looks AND buying two of these ones is still cheaper than buying a single regular/plastic/metal one.  So pretty much, it's great, but you'll have to replace it every year. The end.	1
I wanted a capo I could just put in my pocket and carry around if I needed to.  this is perfect for that purpose.  it holds all the strings tight and in tune with no problem.  it is not for quick fret changing, etc,. but for going to another key to play something,  it works perfectly.  good price too.  I recommend it.	1
This capo is going to fit nicely on my dread naught I assure you. It is the right fit and feel with the right amount of tightness on the frets.you will notice a difference in the way the guitar plays.	1
works like it is suppose to, good quality.  I am able to produce my music with the proper sound needed for the song.  Thank You Kyser Capos	1
I keep these in my guitar cases in case I travel and forget a capo. These are great standby capos and are pretty cheap. They are kind of annoying to use but they are a fraction of a cost of the nicer capos.	1
Great grip and awesome action.  Just one of the best picks out there!  These are my favorite picks for playing fast.	1
I am a LONG time user of the big Fender triangular picks.  I play rhythm guitar in a bluegrass here in Columbus, Ga.  I play mainly a Martin HD-28, but also have a Blueridge BR-180 and a Seagull S6 Coastal Spruce.  I bought a set of these to try them out.  While I have nothing negative to say about these picks, I still prefer my big Finder's.  I guess I'm just too used to the big pick.  While I was playing Katy Daley with one of these Tortex picks, I found that my index finger was hitting the strings, on occassion.  If you haven't been tainted for the big Fender picks, then try out a set of these.  I guess I could get used to them, but will stick with the big Fenders for now.	1
Tortex picks are the best.  Pitch black is so cool.  1.0 mm is the perfect thickness.  Don't buy those other picks, buy these because Tortex ... Black .... 1.0 mm is the perfect combination.	1
This works with equal ease across all six strings, or only the bottom three.  Haven't run across a need to try it on the top three by themselves yet. But judging by its performance on the bottom three, and its fierce grip, it'll do just fine.	1
This capo does not need to exist.  It takes way too much time to tighten/untighten the screw.  If you bring this capo to a jam session, you will exasperate your fellow musicians, as everyone will be constantly waiting on you to fix your capo.  Do yourself a favor and get a capo that can be changed in less than one second.  Your audience will appreciate it, too!	-1
I started out with Dunlop nylons .73 and they are good, although they tend to bend easily and then keep that shape.  I then moved to Fender thin, which don't get me wrong are awesome picks. The Fender thins have a quick release due to the surface.  However they break fast and the tip of the pick tends to get frayed.  Off in search of another pick, which led me here to these, not quite as bendy as the Fender thins and not to thick either.  Great pick for strumming, and single note work.  They also have a good tone to them as the celluoid does.  The best thing overall is they last and last and last...did I mention they last a long time.  Sweet pick.	1
These picks are excellent, but leave it up to me to get the wrong thing. I've been playing with the Tortex guitar picks for a while now but never realized there is a  "jazz" style and a "standard." I bought these picks thinking they were the same size I had been playing with. But when they arrived, to my surprise, they were huge. It wasn't until I did a bit of research that I realized that I'd been playing the "jazz" style.  Since it was completely my fault in not doing my research on the product, there is no way I can give these picks anything less than a 5 star review because I know what there capable of. They are super comfortable and don't slip around or wear out easily. My advice is, since they are so cheap, buy the standard, and the jazz picks and see which ones you like better. It is a huge difference in your playing in the size of the pick. Don't make the same mistake I did!	1
These are my favorite guitar picks because I can grip them better than any other guitar pick (even with sweaty fingers).	1
Nice design easy to use and secure tuning. I usually use a Kyser lamp-style capo. I bought this one on recombination from a friend. Glad I did. What I like is how the capo position locks it smoothly and doesn't throw my strings out of tune with each other.	1
Expensive capos are a waste of money. I own a $30 Kyser and another brand, but I always come back to Dunlop elastic capos.	1
Old school.  Kinda neat.  Will work if the other capos I have,  fail.	1
Unobtrusive, dead-simple ,WORKS, and is very easy on the wallet : what more do ya' want ??  same "good ole'" design I've used (if only  sporatically) for decades....very glad to find it's still made (and hasn't changed a BIT) !!	1
great product	1
VERY GOOD CAPO, NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR REGULAR CAPOS, BUT A COMPLEMENT TO IT. WELL BUILT. I HAVE USED THESE OVER THE YEARS AND FIND THEM QUITE HANDY. THEY DO GET TIRED AFTER MUCH USE, THE EXTRA HOLES HELP COMPENSATE FOR THIS. I DID HAVE ONE LAST 10 YEARS, BUT FABRIC DOES BREAK DOWN WITH TIME. A GOOD CHOICE!	1
For the money it works well without scratching you guitars neck.	1
Works great, but it is a little annoying to have to tighten and loosen the screw to use every time.  Some responses to comments I've seen in the reviews: --I've had mine for 5 years, used moderately, and the wear on the metal from the bottom of the screw is negligible. Haven't put a pad there or anything. --The manual screw functionality does, I feel, give an added level of control...you can make it very tight to ensure no buzz. --However, range of motion is on the wide side. To get it to properly capo the first fret on my acoustic, I have to put it right on the edge of the 1st string, and screw it down all the way, and it does sometimes leave some buzz.  The price is nice though, so I would recommend it as a perfectly fine capo.	1
I've been using this for roughly a year now, and it works fine.  It feels a bit cheap, but then it IS cheap.  It's not as easy to move as a spring-loaded capo, but it's also much lower profile.  Overall, I like it and it's certainly worth the (minimal) price.	1
Product as described.	1
Great accessory.	1
I've used these for several years. I like them a lot but after long use, they tend to crack at the top of the bend. For me, buying more involves two hours driving and the general hassle of finding a music store that carries them. I ordered a bulk pack which should last me quite a long time and works out to be cheaper than buying a few at a time.	1
This is a pretty good deal if you look at the price of other capos, and you get free shipping. Yeah, it's not as quick to use as the spring loaded ones, but still not bad; better than an elastic strap type. It is also great for creating your own short cut and drop D capos.  With a sharp razor you could do all sorts of crazy stuff.  Do not overtighten the screw because the bottom arm is thin. You can add a pad of some sort, or just take care to not to over-tighten it. I'm the type of person that would glue in a small piece of material if it broke through.  So, far it doesn't look like it will though.	1
Definitely not a fast release capo, but its a good and cheap capo that you can carry in your keys and thats why i bought it.	1
Doesn't work with the Dobro or guitar well	-1
Happy with it. Will buy again.	1
Thank You!	1
If you are looking for a great product that works good, for the right price, this is the one for you.  A great buy!	1
Excellent and perfect fit for my Takamine G Jumbo EG523SC Acoustic-Electric Guitar.  Actually, there was nothing necessarily "wrong or broken" with my original Takamine input jack.  The sodder points were all connected, but for some reason, I kept getting a crackling sound when plugged in live.  I've seen this happen before on a friends 414 Taylor.  It could be bad fit cables.  Although, I have tried Monster cables, Planet Waves, generic cables, braided fender cables, generic braided, etc.  I even tore apart the jack end pin and everything was  connected and assembled correctly.  I finally got fed up and bought this as a replacement. This was an easy replacement endpin jack.  I've had ZERO crackling cable issues when leading worship at church.  It's been over a year and a half now and still no issues.  Love this endpin jack.  Should fit all standard endpin holes.  Easy soddering..	1
This is a heavy-duty unit with very good chrome plating. It comes with the three screws to attach it to the tail end of your guitar. It is wired for a pre-amp set up also, if that is the kind of system you are using. I used it with a passive pickup, and it worked just fine. Note that you will have to drill a pretty large hole in your instrument, as this thing is thick--heavy-duty, like I said. I ended up using some longer screws to mount it securely, but it does the job and looks very nice.	1
Much better than the Dunlop style.	1
Use these all the time and are my favorite pick. Was glad to find the 12 pack on Amazon, much cheaper then $2 a pop at a music store. A single one last me about a week, more or less.	1
Great capo, it's lasted a couple months for me and does the job well no complaints	1
I know the title seems very scary but allow me to explain. I bought this with my tailor because it's a very cheap capo and honestly I wanted to try something different than the ones I have now. I figured it's extremely inexpensive and it can live in my Taylors case.  Be warned. This capo can scratch your neck in two different ways.  1. If you use the first hole on the capo which you will be inclined to do. You may scratch your neck because the metal on the capo is coming in contact with your guitar neck. So no matter how tight the elastic is or how thick your guitar neck is you must I repeat must use the second hole for the metal on the first one will be covered by elastic.  2. Taking the cable off the capo can be tricky. As soon as you unhook the elastic the metal rings on the elastic can scrape your guitar neck. Now I've scratched my tailor when I first tried to escape on it and I've also decided to order another one for my Martin backpacker. You wonder why there's two ways it can scratch your guitar because I scratch to separate guitars.  As a side note I've used the old walnut trick to get rid of the scratches. If you do not know this trick be sure to look it up.  Also another side note to take this cable off properly I would push to keep up against the strings so that when you touch the elastic it does not scratch your guitar neck. I have to say I'm shocked that no one else has had this problem that I've had but I felt that you needed to be warrant.  Now that all that is out of the way. I really love this capo even if it only lasts a year or two it holds on tightly to my guitar strap. And also went on the guitar body the capo takes up little to no room allowing you full use around the capo. I hope this helped and heed my warning.	1
Does not work well.  Very difficult to get to keep strings down.	-1
it works but a pain to put on and take off sometimes.  Really, you should get a Kayser or the Dunlop clamp/trigger style capo.  Not that much more and you will be better off in the long run.  I replaced this with one of those and never use this one now.  But it does work and it is cheap.	1
Couldn't find finger picks at music stores in town, so these were fine. Thanks.	1
Great quality picks. The business end extends toward the string just far enough. Large enough to fit my thumb perfectly.	1
These fit my thumbs well, but they are plastic, so they break of course. That's why I buy a dozen.	1
When they say small, they mean small.  I had to order the large to get it comfortably on my ring finger, and my hands are not large by anyone's standards.    Find the same slide in Large, and I wrote a complimentary review there.	1
...And I've tried them all.    Back in the day I was dumping Coricidin in the trash to get an empty bottle like Duane Allman, I've used socket wrenches, hacksawed off pieces of pipe, tried actual necks from wine bottles, and bought slides made out of chrome, ceramic, aluminum, and glass in a variety of shapes.    End of the day, this slide is balanced to be easy to handle, and it makes a wonderful classic sound, whether single notes on an electric, or open tuning on an acoustic.	1
After experiencing some frustration with the tone differences and the difference in the amount of noise between a Stevens steel bar (for lap playing) and a Dunlop 210 glass over-the-finger slide (for "Spanish style" playing), I decided to try the Dunlop Harris tapered brass slide.  It's probably a personal issue, but I much prefer the weight of the brass slide.  The taper seems to cover the stings of my resonator guitar more consistently than the straight glass slide.  The sustain is better and the string noise is easier to control.  This slide also seems to be well made and has a nice shine to it.  The material and the fact that it fits better than the glass slide are significant pluses.  Another practical plus for the brass slide is that I don't have to worry about what would happen if I drop it.  In short:  it's a winner.	1
For an elastic guitar capo it is very good and fits my 12 string Alvarez pretty well.	1
piece of crap. don't bother buying this. it doesnt cleanly hold down the strings and sounds so bad. buy a spring capo.	-1
I don't use a Capo all that often, but this traditional style single wrap fabric strap seems to work well enough for my needs and was priced right. It's easy for me to put on and remove and holds the strings down securely. Overall, it does what its supposed to do when I need it, so I'm happy with it.	1
If you want a P.O.S. holder to hold your prized harmonicas, then by all means get this one. This will come loose, and scratch your harmonicas up to no end. Stay away from this garbage, and get a Hohner, or better yet, get a Hohner FlexRack,(the best yet) and be done with it.	-1
I have been playing harmonica for close to twenty years and started playing the guitar a few years ago. Friends have been bugging me to do both simultaneously, so I thought I would buy this unit.  If I had looked carefully at the design I would not have purchased this holder.  The way it is designed it only holds the rectangular harmonicas and on both my Special 20s and Lee Oscars it will hold them but it is extremely difficult for me to get them in and out.  Each time I have scratched my harmonica pretty severely.  It also will only work on the rectangular type, I have a few harmonicas that are more rounded (Seydel and Hohner Golden Melody), this will not work for these at all.  The better kind of holder has the spring loaded plate that holds the instrument in place.  The unit is too cheap to bother returning, but I would not suggest it.  It may work for other people, but did not work for me.	-1
These are good fitting thumb picks. My hands are not that big, but the large fits well on my thumb. It is a "hard" pick, so took a little getting used to since most of my regular picks are "medium". But for finger-picking blues, these work great.	1
Nice picks, comfortable	1
Very good.  Comfortable and fits just right.	1
I bought this kind of on a whim, none of the songs my band plays really call for a bass wah. I'm really glad I did because I have been having a blast playing with it. You can get some really neat sounds out of this by experimenting a little.  I brought it to rehearsal, used it on a couple songs and my bandmates loved it.  I read some reviews online that complained the pedal colored their sound when not in use. I did some A-B tests with my rig and could not notice any of this, your mileage may vary.  It does a really good job of making the effect without sucking the low end away. I am impressed.  It seems to be built really well and it looks great too.	1
I purchased this pedal locally after owning a Boss Wah and wanting something different. After owning an original Crybaby forever, I bought this to use with a jazz bass and it has replaced to an extent my Boss Wah pedal. This thing is built like a tank, as are all Crybaby pedals it seems and the Q control makes using the pedal a great experience. I adjusted the Q and leave it in the middle and can regulate almost any wah tone.  The Bass crybaby seems to work as well as the original and I plan on using it for years. It works better for me than a pedal with 2 or three knobs and has been around forever. I removed the plastic feet and applied velcro to the bottom with ease. There is even a plastic film on the bottom which can be removed before pedalboard use. the connectors and gear on the pedal also seem to be solid. There is alot of grease on the gears also which is good for long term use. I highly suggest the bass Crybaby.	1
This is an incredible pedal, and is worth every cent you pay for it. It will certainly take a chunk out of your wallet, but if you want a bass wah that will sound incredible and LAST (it's seriously durable) this is the one you need to get.	1
I am very pleased with the purchase of the product arrived on time and just when it indicates amazon, thank you.	1
Ok	1
This slide really hits the strings right. It produces a nice clear tone and is well balanced	1
OK for a student, or someone with tiny fingers.	-1
Great quality balance and value.	1
Capos are generally well built, this one has a pretty tight band. Didn't fray so far, elasticity is still good,	1
They seem to work ok but I like the thinner thumb picks better so will be ordering a different brand in the future.	1
I have smaller hands, and even with the "L" for large, these fit my thumb the best out of all I've tried so far; they don't squeeze the life out of my thumb. The picking portion also does not stick out too much as some others. I definitely would buy these again.	1
had to return it because it was too small, but just what it was suppose to be	1
Nice weight, well machined, and a nice sustaining tone.  Not as heavy as some brass slides, but the tapered body is really what makes this slide special.  The taper seems to help when barring five or six strings, particularly when playing dead thumb bass, alternating bass or the like, I prefer this slide (and metal slides in general) for use with resophonic and acoustic guitars.	1
This is a very high quality Slide and really serves the purpose very well. Try one...............I think that you will love it, if that's what you're looking for.	1
I have very small hands. This slide is slightly loose on me, but I wouldn't recommend this medium size for any man with average sized hands.  However, this is a really great slide. The shape perfectly fits the curve of the strings and has a clear, warm tone. Being a brass slide, it's quite heavy. Make sure you have some really thick gauge strings when you use this.	1
I never use slide to play my guitar, this is the first I ever have, look like good quality, I just have to learn how to play ;-)	1
Amazing product. Highly recommend to friends and fellow musicians alike. Long battery life and the best pedal you can buy.	1
I recently had to replace my much older Cry Baby Wah and I am very happy with this pedal.  I like the new on/off by simply applying my foot to the gas!  Some reviews did not like the fact that it went off when they removed their foot from the pedal, but I do not find this a problem as when I use my pedal, my foot is always on it and when I want it to switch off, I just gently bring the pedal back to home and it's off.  I think the on/off is very smooth and actually like it better.	1
It is one of the best products. It is an excellent brand. it is my favorite. I use many of his products. IT WORKS VERY WELL	1
You can't lose with this classic, can't understand why there is even competition, why not go with the original? This is a solid, durable piece of equipment that can handle that will last for years. Highly recommend this pedal for all beginning and experienced bass players.	1
Looking to add some interest to certain bass parts. This is a lot of fun to play around with. The build quality is excellent and it works great.	1
I love my bass wah! It sounds amazing, great treadle action, adjustable pedal tension, adjustable EQ, adjustable volume. Sounds great with a guitar or bass!	1
The deep sound of this wah is very nice. The range is great and makes a great filter sound. Im not a dan of zakk wylde, but when i tried it at guitar center i had to buy it. Theres only one flaw: when activated the volume slightly dropped, but nothing major.	1
This isn't your standard Crybaby,so if that is the sound you are looking for, this isn't for you. This is really designed to play those awesome leads in the vein of Zak.....high end, pick squalled, rock and metal goodness. That isn't to say that you cant play some cool funky stuff with this wah, but rhythm isn't its primary purpose. Therein lies one of the primary differences between the original Crybaby and Zak's Crybaby. The original has that trademark warm tone that can reach a more more trebled state, whereas the Zak wah begins with a bit more of a treble tone. You probably wouldnt set this to play an Iommi style muddy, open wah rhythm, for example. Then again, you might...ultimately, it comes down to tone preference. Personally, i think this wah kicks some serious A@#! As you may have guessed, i primarily use this for leads. I have been toying with the idea of using both this and the standard together, but haven't actually done so yet, lol. Anyway, if you play a bit of a heavier style of music, i think this wah will suit you fine. I love it!  Enjoy!	1
This is the best cry baby pedal I have ever played with my stuff, I used to play with the original cry baby from Dunlop wich was great, but I needed something huge for Metal music, so I found an answer with this pedal.	1
Good, affordable lightweight strings for most types of mandolin playing. A preferred practice of mine is to keep a set around in case I have to restring entirely, and if something breaks, I can restring from this set, then replenish with a single pair of strings for $1-2$, so I always have a complete set, but don't get stuck with 4-5 of any one string size.	1
The J74's are sort of the default string that mandolin dealers put on their instruments.  They are bright and brassy when new, and give a decent punch to the sound.  However because they are bronze, they can discolor your fingers and they tarnish pretty quickly, especially in the summer when your fingers are sweatier.  Also, since they are round-wound, they are harder to fret than a flat-wound string and harder to shift up and down.  But the people who like them change them often, like once in 30 days or so, or whenever they play a gig, to get that nice bright brassy punch for when they are new.  This is because they get to a point where you have to work harder just to get the same volume, being less elastic, and less lively.  One thing is sure, that the J74's are loud and zingy, and that's why dealers put them on their mandolins.  Some folks move to the heavier J75's to get even louder and fatter woof on their chops.  The J74's are brighter and more aggressive than flatwound strings and cut through when you're in ensemble work.  Just make sure to change them often to get the best performance.	1
These have been my go to mandolin strings for over 25 years.  I've tried other brands but always come back to these.	1
The defacto standard for Mando strings.	1
Exactly what my hubby wanted!	1
good	1
Product works as advertised	1
As promised	1
I bought these to put handles on a 2x12 cabinet I recently built. They work perfectly. I didn't want the traditional side handles, and decided to mount these two straps on top at the outer edges. It makes carrying and repositioning the cabinet so much easier and the strap feels like it is plenty sturdy to carry the weight.	1
Strap fit perfectly. Easy to replace the old broken one,	1
This was a good replacement for the handle on my Fender Rumble 75 Bass Combo. It is, however, different from the original adjustable handle. The original handle had the ability be pulled out for grabbing or lying flat which is useful if you want to place something on top your amp.	1
nice handle	1
I'm pretty much addicted to those super snazzy new hi-tek strings from Elixir, but I keep a few packages of these around for emergencies (I keep a package in the cases of the mandolins I'll carry around, just in case).  Before the Elixir strings were developed, I used these (or the J62s) pretty much exclusively.  They sound GREAT, play great, and if you regularly clean and lube them, they'll last as long as any other fairly inexpensive great strings.  They're not my swear-by-one-and-only strings anymore, but they'll do! :-)	1
Arrived quickly and they are just what they are supposed to be! Thank you.	1
Buy these!  You won't be disappointed!  Bright, clear sound.	1
The standard that all other strings are compared to!	1
Wonderfull instrument, I recommend it	1
Actually bought these for someone else but I've used this brand of strings for years on my guitars and mando.  Always top quality. Great sounding, too!	1
Just wanted a set of strings for an seldom used Morgan Monroe mandolin. These strings sure put some new life back in the mandolin. I don't know how long they will last, as I don't play this mandolin very often.	1
Works great!	1
I like this little guy, I mostly use it in addition to a full size slide to broaden the note and fretting possibilities ... With this and a full size slide you can grab some minor chords and hit a whole new level in your riffs! I do occasionally use it by itself too, It has great tone, and a surprising amount of sustain for such a small slide. I'll wear it on my pick hand too on occasion  and lay down some convoluted counter rhythms to my fret hand slide! I only gave it 4 stars because my main slide is the 220...	1
I've been a user of Savarez strings (Red label - High tension) because I love their crisp and loud sound and feel. Got this combination of high tension bass cords with normal tension ones, but I find this set dull and difficult to keep tuned. It definitely lacks the brightness and volume I expect from a Savarez string.	-1
I tried ths model for the very first time. It has a combination of High Tension in bass chords D, A & E and standard tension in treeble chords E, B & G. It's an interesting combination keeping Savarez sound quality!	1
I have tried lots of other strings from Savarez and other brands but I keep coming back to these. I prefer high tension bases due to the low action of one my guitars. I also like nylon trebles over fluorocarbon as nylon is thicker and less likely to slip out of the bridge. These base strings are supposed to be more flexible but I can't really perceive a difference there. For overall sound and playability, these are great.	1
Kenny Hill in California designed my guitar and recommends these strings. If you cannot afford Kenny's high end guitars (costing thousands of dollars and owned by almost every big name music pro), then I recommend his line of Cordoba guitars. Look at the C7-CE cedar top, a very sensual guitar. This is a top of the line design (among many) executed with excellent manufacturing quality control delivering a quality guitar at a killer price point. Thank you, Kenny. You can buy it from Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/Cordoba-Nylon-String-Acoustic-Electric-Guitar-Natural/dp/B003XJ0320/ref=sr_1_5?s=musical-instruments&ie=UTF8&qid=1341080174&sr=1-5&keywords=cordoba+c7.  If you are a beginner, keep in mind that many beginners start with an el-cheapo guitar which even a pro could not make it sound good. Don't discourage yourself. Look seriously at Kenny's Cordoba line of guitars.  I got these strings from Amazon. I find them excellent. I tried some others but these beat them out. I love the resonant tone I get on the treble strings (possibly partly due to the normal tension) while still getting ringing bass (high tension in this set). It is a little weird that the tension level for the bass three strings is high while the tension for the treble three is medium. But it works really well.  I still have not tried strings with the plastic web type coatings. They claim these last a lot longer because they keep finger dirt, grease, and sweat from getting into the strings which crud makes them go "dead" a lot sooner. When strings go dead they become nearly impossible to tune so they always sound out of tune. I read this has something to do with the way they vibrate, but this info is too complex to explain right now. Fresh strings are easy to tune but when brand new they are still stretching a lot so you got to keep tuning between songs. This affects the bass strings more than the trebles. But then, that is always one characteristic of nylon string guitars. Get yourself a good electronic tuner or use the one built in to your guitar if it has one to check tuning between each song. Tuning on stage is ok, your fans will appreciate your attention to detail and respect for their ears. So the appeal is longevity. This longevity issue mostly affects the bass three strings because they are wound which leaves a lot more room for junk to contaminate them. Longevity is quite appealing because longevity is a large problem for nylon strings. One thing you can do is only replace the bass strings because the treble strings deliver good tone and vibration twice as long. If you do this, try using high tension bass with your existing normal tension treble strings. I just placed some web plastic protected strings on one of my guitars. To start with, they do not play as well as these Savarez split-tension strings. It is the first time I ever used high tension trebles. But the bass strings sound great. We'll see about longevity. What if Savarez began using the plastic Web coating or what if the other companies started using split-tension string sets? Maybe I'll update this review later...  godembryo	1
These were recommended to us by a couple of professional musicians & instructors and we have been extremely happy with the tone and life they offer.  We're repeat buyers on this product and I don't see that changing in the near future.	1
Fantastic strings.  Always amazed when I first put them on how the mandolin comes alive.	1
new	1
Love this Rosin. Great stuff.	1
good quality strings	1
I have used this specific set of D'Addario strings on most of my Mandolins, for over two decades. They are a well made string, noticeably warmer tone than bright bronze and last as long as the other company's competing products. The real plus that keeps me coming back to these strings (I try most everything out there) is consistency. Very rarely is there ever any kind of quality issue from this company. I also use their acoustic and electric Guitar strings, Octave Mando strings and Mandola strings. You would think as many as I use they would give me some free sets!	1
My son uses this on his cello and loves it.	1
good piece of equipment for the price! No concerns or complaints	1
I LOVE this Capo!  I've used these Dunlop Capos for years now, and for a number of reasons.  First, while they may not be as quick to place as the "clothespin" type of Capo, and therefore maybe not the first choice for LIVE performances (where you need to change setups quickly), they WILL give you far more secure control of the strings once in place. You may need to "arrange" the strings a little before clamping it down, in case they've splayed out a little (and they may). Once clamped down, it's NOT MOVIN'!  Secondly, it's LESS OBTRUSIVE than the "clothespin" OR "roller" types. You WON'T find yourself bangin' yer hand into it when you're playing up close to it, a CONSTANT annoyance to me with the other styles. If you DO hit it, it's not gonna MOVE on you like the other types do, and possibly go out of tune or start buzzing cuz it's moved too far away from the fret; it's gonna STAY PUT. It just plain doesn't "get in the way".  And maybe the thing I like BEST about the lil' Lever Capo? It's PORTABILITY. I'm a musician, and if I'm out-and-about and there's a guitar around, I'm probably gonna have to pick it up and start playing, if allowed, and if it's appropriate. Guitars are out there, sometimes seemingly EVERYWHERE; Capos are NOT. It's nice to have a few "tools" with ya, for when the occasion arises. I'm NOT about to carry one of those other-style Capos around in my pocket ("Is that your CAPO, or are you just happy to see me?"). But these Dunlops are so small, it's easy to carry around with the two or three picks you've already got stuffed in your pocket (you know you do).  So, get TWO; one for your CASE, one for your POCKET.  .	1
Yes, I,m enjoying the J74 D,addario mando strings.... Bar None the Best!  I have used D,Addario strings for 25-30 years in all my instruments (guitar, dobro, fiddle, and steel guitar!)  The Only changes I make....is the "guage-size" but Non Better than D,Addario for sounds n longevity!  Have used D,Addario strings for 40 years! Thanx LesH	1
These are pretty much THE STANDARD in a well-balanced, all-around mandolin string. Bright but not too much.  Plenty of punch.  Just a very, very good string.	1
I love these strings they are a little more mellow than most mando strings so they sit in the mix and let the guitars cut though a little more. I'm hoping they last a while!	1
I only use D' Addario strings on my Guitar and Mandolin.  I discovered the strings about eight years ago.  I was playing in a band all the used was D'Addario's so I gave them try.	1
I'm a fan of D'Adarrio strings and am pleased with this brand.  The company has these strings at a good price and shipping is fast.  I would recommend strings and this company.	1
great look and protection. A snap to install. Good price	1
I have a mahogany with no pickguard... This did the tick... I now have pick protection and a better looking guitar... Happy with purchase.	1
very good	1
EXCELLENT PRODUCT...	1
I've happily used D'Addario strings for guitars for many years.  These mandolin strings have not disappointed.  Great strings! Sweet sound!!	1
This is my first online purchase for strings, and the best . Very good price for the quality of strings, they are great	1
There is a reason that this is the best-selling set for mandolin. D'Addario's EXP (coated) version seems to be catching on now, and could give these a run for their money. I don't think they'd mind too much..	1
Quality strings at a very affordable price.  They are made from quality materials and care is given with quality control to ensure the buyer of a good product.	1
I have several mandolins and have tried every other brand and type of mandolin strings including GHS, Elixers and EXP.  I was getting some fret work done a while back and the luthier suggested these.  I now use J-74's exclusively on all my mandolins, including those with pickups.  They feel great and last a long time.  I play hard and have yet to break one.  D'Addario makes great mandolin strings, too bad they can't make decent guitar strings anymore	1
These strings are bright, have a crisp tone, and they feel great. I have just started playing mandolin and these are easy on the finger tips. For the price you really can't go wrong with these ones and if you have just started playing, I would recommend these.	1
I bought a cheap Rogue A100 mandolin, and after setting it up I of course replaced the cheap factory strings.  I put these on, and what a difference.  These aren't too heavy, not too light.  They ring nicely.  I find that coating bronze strings with a good string cleaner, like Dunlop 65 Ultraglide, can help you avoid the dirty fingers and get much more life from the strings.	1
I am using these strings on an inexpensive A-Style Beginner's Mandolin; these strings made a significant difference in the quality and tone of the instrument; I strongly recommend these strings.	1
What more can I say? These strings sound GREAT! They play wonderfully, work well together, have a nice brilliant (but not tinny) sound, and are excellently made. These are not going to unwind on you or break easily.  Excellent. That's all there is to say about it.	1
What can onsay about these/ They are just one of the best if  not the best strings.  They don;t require much stretching to stay in tune, super tone.	1
Nicely made, but the way the instrument arm screws onto the clamp side, it will come loose.  You will need to use some lock tight on the threads to keep it in place.  Also the head on the thumb screw that tights the clamp to the stand pole is small and hard to get a grip on.  I'll try to find a better style thumb screw. Maybe one with a knob so it is easier to grip.	1
Very hard to assemble. And the instructions included weren't for this product.	-1
Useful on stage	1
Not sure what the plate in the middle is for but otherwise it works well. Solidly made.	1
Great accessory for classical stringed instruments with bow holders!	1
Great piece to have	1
After buying one to make sure it fit on my&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/K-M-Heavy-Duty-Music-Stand-Regular-Black/dp/B0009JR9YC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">K & M Heavy Duty Music Stand Regular Black</a>, and then reading another review here where they mentioned having more than one hanger on their stand, I purchased a second as I play a concert uke and a banjolele.  Now I can keep both of my ukes on the stand, and safer from being knocked around.  Not only do these fit the K&M stand, but they also easily fit on the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Gearlux-Collapsible-Orchestra-Music-Stand-Black/dp/B009MBT68U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Gearlux Collapsible Orchestra Music Stand - Black</a>, so when I won't be traveling for a bit I put them on the Gearlux and get two more instruments off of my floor.  UPDATE just regarding stands-that-fit: I have had to replace my K&M traveling stand, and unfortunately these hangers do not fit on the bottom shaft of the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hola-HM-MS-Professional-Folding-Orchestra-Sheet-Music-Stand-Carrying-bag/dp/B00JL760E8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hola! HM-MS+ Professional Folding Orchestra Sheet Music Stand + Carrying bag</a>.  They do fit on the upper shaft, but the bottom shaft is so tall that unless you stand while playing it's going to be tricky if you are trying to change ukes quickly (like during a performance).  I did glue a thick piece of leather to the inside of the 'rod' side to keep from scratching my stands, I'm surprised the manufacturer didn't put something there to protect the stand.  And keep your eye on the plastic cover for the screw as they can fly off - I lost one right away.  It does seem to take forever to tighten the screw on the skinny post so I usually leave them on the traveling stand though I have to remove the 'Y' part or the stand won't fit in it's bag.  It would be awesome if the 'Y' could fold up, then I wouldn't have to deal with trying to screw them on when in a hurry while setting up.  I also bought some clear tubing from Ace and put it on the legs of the K&M to protect the ukes getting dings from knocking into them, as I am usually sitting when playing so the ukes hang pretty low.  Highly recommend!  Update 12/2017:  I have yet to have a problem with these ukulele hangers (other than the black cap has gone missing from one), and am going to buy a third to keep on my 'home' stand.  I leave the first two on my traveling stand all the time now that I've been performing more - it's impossible to put them on/take them off quickly, either removing from the stand shaft or removing the hook.  They keep the K&M stand from fitting in it's bag, but I'm going to make a wider bag so everything will fit.	1
It's an excellent product, very sturdy, but takes a lot longer than similar swings to take on and off your stand. if weight of your instrument is a concern, this is much more stable than a pricier "clip on" swing.	1
great quality	1
Easy to install, sturdy. In mine the additional violin hanger also had a spike to hang an 2nd bow.	1
Attached perfectly to my acoustic guitar stand.  I now have a safe easy access place to hang my Ukulele.	1
This thing comes in handy at many of my gigs. I play multiple instruments including the violin, and sometimes you don't have room on stage for a violin stand. It has a bow holder like in the picture and works great. Just make sure you screw it in tight so your violin doesn't fall on the floor during a set. And remember to take it with you when you leave! It's small so it's easy to forget it.	1
Works well for my concert and tenor ukes. With a small practice space, it gets the instrument off the floor and away from our <sometimes> crazy puppy.	1
Simple device.  Easy to use.  Perfect for band or any multi-instrument setting.	1
After reading the reviews for this strap, I wasn't expecting much....and to be honest, I prefer a nice vintage leather strap on my Hofner bass anyway. For the brief period of time that I had this on my bass, I was surprised by how many compliments I got on the strap. I now keep it as a back up in my gig bag, but for the price it's pretty cool.	1
This is a great looking strap for an acoustic or electric.  Things to note: - The patern is actually alternating diagonal stipes of a rust brown and yellow tweed colors - The strap ends look like cheap leather, unfortunately, but have not affected the finish of my guitar which is important - Since this is a fabric strap, it will bind on your clothing when trying to adjust shoulder placement or guitar angle on the fly	1
If you need a dust cover, then this is it, plus its zipper is on the rear so, the instrument has to slid in & out. It's nice looking and if this is what your looking for, it's OK but, I wouldn't use it, (no padding.) I take better care of my instruments. If you wish it to be a temp. use to cover your instrument from rain, it's good, for an occasional carry. It's more a sports bag.	-1
I didn't expect much for the money so was not disappointed. Half-size Hohner classical fits tight and is difficult to insert or remove, my grand kids can't do it without help. Bag is only useful to keep dust off of the guitar, and to make it easier to carry. It is not padded so it offers no other protection. But for what it is, and what it costs, it is fine.	1
I purchased this uke hook and attached it to my music stand in my home office. Easily installed in 30 seconds - makes picking up the uke on a whim easy to do. I play and practice more due to this little hanger! Love it!	1
We own two of these, and two of the violin holders. One set for our rehearsal space and one for stage, They work perfectly. Nothing else to say really. Affordable, and they work.	1
The hanger is inexpensive and so convenient for keeping the second ukulele or mandolin at hand.  if you play the instruments interchangeably.	1
I like their wall-mounted hangers and I also like this one. It will attach to any cylindrical object within reason and I like the bow hanger, I bought 2 of these.	1
This Gigbag is very basic. No padding and made to fit a variety of 1/2 size guitars. Unless you cover the guitar with some padding before putting it in the bag it doesn't do much. I wrapped the guitar in T-shirts.  I would suggest spending $5-10 more and getting something with padding	-1
I have a small guitar- I think called a requinto.  It has a normal-sized neck and headstock, and it did not come close to fitting in this bag.  The bag was also very flimsy compared to bags that are just a few dollars more.  Not a fan.	-1
This was a big disappointment.  The violin back hits the pole of the music stand, an encounter in which the violin invariably looses. It's too easy for the bow to swing and hit the belly of the violin even handling everything with utmost care.  I would not recommend this.  If it had at least come with a way to attach it to the wall or to a cabinet, it wouldn't be a total loss, but as it is, even returning it would cost would cost as much as the whole gadget costs.  A total waste of money.	-1
These are NOT large, and I have medium-size hands for a man. If these are large, I can't imagine what the "small" sizes are like. These just barely fit on the tip of my index finger, I would not recommend.	-1
Doesn't fit	-1
Too narrow	-1
Product does not look like the picture. I hate it when the product that was not delivered is not what was described or picture.	-1
unusable hunks of plastic	-1
Broken in a month use.	-1
Vintage leather is dull, sometimes even rough. Almost unfinished. By contrast, the leather on this strap is shiny and looks like cheap vinyl. It's leather, but they made it look like cheap vinyl (who knows why). Vintage tweed cloth also has a straw color to it. By contrast, this strap is striped taxi-cab-yellow and olive green. Maybe it would look like tweed to a blind blues player standing 50 feet away?	-1
Doesn't work.	-1
This would have been a nice slide if I could get it on my finger.  I'm borderline skinny and it still won't fit.  Save your money unless your under 10 years old.	-1
These are my favorite finger and thumb picks. They sound good on the strings, and they are just malleable enough to be made to fit your fingers. The only problem is that the package contains 20 finger picks and no thumb picks.	-1
It has petroleum distillates in it. There is a warning right on it that says "DO NOT DRINK" and "Contains Petroleum Distillates". I guess I'm back to using cooking oil to lube my neck and strings. It would have been nice of the manufacturer to warn us on their web page that this stuff is deadly. They only tell you what's not in it. Yes, petroleum distillates are deadly, and you don't want to have it in contact with your skin. Rubbing it into your fingers for hours while playing the guitar has to be a risky practice. I don't want poison all over my playing hand. Screw that. Why not just soak your fingers in gasoline? One might as well just spray WD-40 all over his guitar. It too is full of petroleum distillates, but it's a lot cheaper.	-1
I read a lot of good things about this. I went to a music shop and the salesman said he used this every time he changed strings. He said it was good for strings also. I tried it on two guitar. A cheap one and a mid price one. On the cheap on it did make it look much better. It does muff the sounds of the strings. On the good guitar it made the color darker. So, far I do not like it. I will try some other ideas. The bottle does not tell you what you are using. Many are using some kind of oil, maybe lemon or orange or other. The bottle says it never dries. It says the only way to get it off is to rub it off. It also says to use a very small amount. If I change my mind on this I will come back an amend this but right now I do not like it at all.   It says it can go on strings but do not do it. It will not come off. You will rub but you will have to get new strings. You might could use it as a wax but this is not what the big companies use.	-1
very poor quality, don't bother. Unless your guitar also is cheap and useless.	-1
Flimsy.  Seems like a nit, but it is so thin that when you need to adjust quickly when clinging to your shirt you can't move the strap.  The Ernie Ball straps are heavier and easier to adjust and cheaper.  This strap drives me crazy when playing on stage and the strap is stuck to my clothes and too thin to just flip it and reposition easily.	-1
HI SPORTS FANS I GOT BACK INTO PLAYING GUITAR RECENTLY AFTER A 12 YEAR LAYOFF DUE TO A FINGER INJURY. SO I ORDERED STRINGS, CAPO, POLISH, PICKS YOU KNOW. WELL TO MAKE IT BRIEF THAT 65 POLISH DOESNT CLEAN OR SHINE BIG WASTE OF MONEY. ENDED UP BUYING MUSICNOMAD FROM MY LOCAL GUITAR STOREE THE STUFF WORKS GREAT, AND NO I DONT WORK FOR THEM ITS JUST A MUCH BETTER PRODUCT. BYBY FROM SYRACUSE HOME OF THE DIRTIEST LAKE IN THE COUNTRY. SYRACUSE SCOTT	-1
Very flimsy. Not what I expected.	-1
I bought these strings because they are designated flamenco and I just wanted to see if there is a difference in tone to what I normally use, (Daddario classical normal)  These do not stay in tune as well and the winding on the fourth string broke right over the third frett the second day I had them on, maybe a bad string I don't know but I won't use these again	-1
Item is not quite what is advertised.  Do not buy this thinking you can just install them and be good to go...what is not told is that they are only HALF of the rivet pieces needed to complete the job.	-1
Dont waste your money, these clave are made of soft wood and sound terrible. Buy the LP grenadilla wood clave instead.	-1
Sorry Fender...this one is just a waste of money.  Get something better that doesn't twist up an ravel into knots.	-1
I ended up returning this item because in the picture it looks tan/brown, but it really looks yellow and brown.	-1
This is the second, a replacement for the first which was completely unacceptable. The quality of assembly and how stored prior to sale is poor. They store them folded which means the tubing is likely butchered where it meets the Harp clamp edge. The first had allot of discoloration there, rust I guess, looked like some liquid of some kind, --it was hard to see through the beaten up bag it was in.  This one too, is a bit chewed up from this way of storing, not guarding it, or build it so it may be folded and not damage itself (?).  Well, that would mean the other assembly should be done with care like the Harp stops on the back to keep the Harp from pushing through, lining uip straight in the clamps. On this one, the replacement, they are not in line, actually 3 mm off (~1/16in) so the Harp will be farther back on one side.  So, now, I suppose one has to start BENDING things to make it all align for use and ignore the self chewed up issues on this new item.  I suppose I can AGAIN try for a replacement, but, then what?  The alternatives are a very large, much more expensive units, or very questionable wire, stamped out designs. Any of these would not be as much a concern for me if sold for far less than they ask for them.  So, regardless of any old reviews, or by folks who don't have a clue about this equipment and be prepared to send for exchange at least once or more even. I am still not sure I won't try for a well stored, packed, undamaged poorly assembled unit, and regardless of price. By it's very nature it is bendable, but ideally not meant to be bent since does what? Accurately holds a 1/4in hole in front of your face while you place guitar, ---geese...    -- Oh, yes, a large Stamp on the bottom bracket "Made in China", proudly embossed, yes, indeed.	-1
Not sure what all the complaints are about, Just got my strap in and it looks and feels fine and for less than 8 bucks? The hooks and hardware are polymer and will not ding the banjo, the short straps are black nylon and the shoulder strap is made of a soft weave material (not sure appears to be a natural fiber). So over all I'm very pleased with its a good looking bluegrass pattern and functional fittings.  Best all,  Follow up: well sorry to say but the strap didn't hold up very well; it worked well for about 2 months and then started to roll up into a rope like form over the shoulder and the banjo neck would not stay in the up position :( So I ordered a Gold Tone Leather strap (about $35) and it works great, sorry, but it was nice while it lasted, but I would recommend buying a better strap. Note: if money is an issue Deering offers a really nice nylon strap for $12.95 on their site.  Best all	-1
Not a good idea.  The Violin can fall down.	-1
It is too tall for me so the "one size fits all' does not apply. I have to actually tilt my head up in order to use this and there is no adjustment to lower it. I saw someone with the same problem say that they reversed the direction of the holder so that the neck brace part curved down instead of up.  That works for the height but the brace then digs into your chest. I'll keep this but try to find one that fits better.	-1
Go with the higher end ones from Hohner. I did and was much happier	-1
Inexpensive but cheap. The plastic clips "slip" off the metal loops easily. The strap is too smooth and shifts across my back too easy. Should have spent a bit more on a better strap.	-1
Not very comfortable with weight of banjo	-1
The product picture looks better. The quality is not what I expected. There was no instruction how to use the strap. The strap have to be hooked directly onto the drum screw. It is broken after a couple of tries.	-1
At first, I thought it would be OK, but I soon discovered that between getting harps in and out, and working with its limited adjustments, surely there was something better. After trying the Hohner Harmonica MZ 2010 Flex Rack, though overpriced, I realized that the HH01 was a waste of time and money. However, if, by chance, its geometry fits your anatomy, and you want to struggle with changing harps, or perhaps only use one harp, some electrical tape on the pinch bars to avoid damage to harps and improve traction might make this a real bargain.	-1
Very small, Line it up good not a lot of room for mistakes.	-1
Oops, this is not the strap I wanted. It's for a saxophone, not a stringed instrument. I'm donating it to our middle school band department.	-1
As a low volume player by necessity, I have tried all of the sticks that claim to be able to keep volume down. Of all the different types of stick that I use, the Tala Wand is at the bottom of the list. It's cymbal sound lacks much, drum sound, not so bad, but not the best. I can't vouch for the Tala Wand's durability, as I just didn't like them enough to find out.  The best low volume stick for all around sound are Regal Tip Blasticks. True, the Blastick is a little harder to control, with it's "whip-like" feel, but it's cymbal bell and drum sound is by far the best, in my opinion.  Hot Rods (medium size) are a better stick, tonally, as well.  Updated - January 2013:  I no longer use these, since the Blasticks are SO much better.  I wouldn't recommend the Tala Wand at all.	-1
Very hard,not what I expected.	-1
This strap is uncomfortable and too flimsy to feel good, also doesn't fit an instrument where there's no place to hook it .  I returned mine, as it just didn't fit well for my uke or mandolin.	-1
Too thick and rough...	-1
Seem a little too rigid for uke	-1
Don't know what I expected for such a cheap price, but this product's quality is in line with its price. Also, the fit over my ukulele's fretboard is very tight, making it hard to put on and remove.	-1
Even with the capo put on correctly, brand new, at the tightest possible setting, some strings still buzz, no matter how and where I adjust it. I can't get it to work so I suppose I'll have to buy a more expensive one	-1
Elastic is very tight and hard to stretch - maybe a larger diameter rubber contact would make it easier to handle and use.	-1
These are thin and not very flexible, though not quite as inflexible as the Performance Plus straps. After receiving this strap, I decided that I am NOT putting it on any of my guitars. Oh well...	-1
Too heavy	-1
Hum hum hum too much, can't use it, cheap waste money, not recommend to any once.	-1
I think some people are cutting this pedal slack because of its low price, but I shall not. It is simply not a good overdrive pedal because the Tone, from MIN to MAX, goes from 'extremely muddy' to 'muddy'. As far as I know, a Tone knob is supposed to increase the treble and decrease the bass as it's turned clockwise, and vise versa counter-clockwise. Well, turning this Tone knob clockwise all the way will still have as much (or possibly more) bass than treble in the mix, to my ear; all it seems to do is raise the mids. If your guitar has any sort of twang or brightness to it, this pedal will cancel it out immediately, with no way to restore it but shutting the pedal off.  And I'm not a FAB hater; I own (and like) the FAB Chorus.  If the Tone was calibrated properly, I suppose this pedal would be a steal, but instead it is a waste. I'm reading some of the other reviews praising this pedal for its 'warm' tone. Yes, but it must be pointed out that a warm/muddy tone is really all this pedal is capable of. To me, that is unacceptable. It is a limitation that most/all other overdrive pedals do not share.	-1
Did not fit my classical guitar properly.	-1
This is a great idea but a terrible implementation. The tiniest bit of extra moisture in this leads to water all over the guitar and in the bridge. Also It barely fits under the strings of the guitar and I would be worried that it would eventually tear up the area around the sound hole. It also did not fit the sound hole on a Cordoba C7. I decided to go ahead and purchase a Humicase hard case otherwise i would have went with one of the oasis humidifiers.	-1
I'm sure the actual bridge shown is great. Instead they sent me one with no notches and no ebony insert. And they did it twice. From what I can tell, this is a scam to get rid of unwanted items by just sending them out and hoping you won't return them. The bridge I received is unusable for me, since it doesn't even have notches for the strings. Don't waste your time ordering here, since there's no way to tell what you will get.	-1
I don't own this PA system, nor do I plan to get one. The only reason I am posting this review is to tell potential customers not to be fooled by this ad. I don't know who listed this product on amazon.com and dared to say it was 600 watts regardless what terminology he/she used, RMS power, maximum power or peak to peak power. There would be no way that a speaker of this size could produce 600 watts of power, this ad is not only misleading, but exaggaration at its extreme. Typically, speakers range from 85-92 db measured at 1 meter with 1 watt applied. Everytime you double the wattage you increase the db by 3. So at 600 watts, it you stood three feet away from this speaker, the dB level would reach to 200 or more, it would be traumatic enough to cause permant hearing loss, then Pyle-pro would be in some serious trouble.	-1
I bought this.  A couple of weeks later the mic quit working.  I tried and tried to get help from Pyle to get it fixed.  No response.  I tried to find out how I could purchase a replacement mic.  For get it!!  Now I'm stuck with an amp, which I specifically purchased to use with the mic, and have no mic for it!!!!  Run!  Run!!!  Ahhhhh!!!!!  Run away from this item!!!  Pyle will give you NO support!!	-1
You have to have the mic IN YOUR MOUTH for the sound to be picked up.  From 3 inches away, it doesn't work.  I tried to work with PylePro to resolve this issue - that's a laugh.  Months and months later, they just sent me a replacement mic that's no better.  HOWEVER, if you get stuck with this PA System, it worked GREAT with a wired microphone from Radio Shack.  I have purchased PA Systems from Pylepro in the past, and their wireless microphones used to work really well.	-1
I purchased this item for a room for about 50 people to announce. 600-watt? I didn't believe its ad instead I expected 50-watt. When I turned on the power switch natural (basic) noise was loud and when turning on the VHF wireless mic the noise was too loud. I gave two star because it has many functions such as ipod player and charger and wireless mic. Otherwise one star is enough.  I think its normail power is around 15~20-watt and max is 50-watt. You can use it outside or in a noisy place with people talking. Don't expect listening to music in a quiet place. Far away from people and speaker. We will use this with wired mic because of the loud noise with wireless mic. If its natural noise is low I would give 3 star.	-1
i can see how others may like these for flatpicking, but in my experience they are useless for finger picking. if i am aggressive at all with it while finger picking it slips off. i think increased (over the usual) pick length (while nice for flat picking) increases the leverage when you pick i string and pries it. i would much prefer a ticker material. it sounds alright, but not useful to me.	-1
this rhythm machine is nowhere near as good as the zoom rhythm machine RT223	-1
I think Meinl suffers from quantity control issues. I've watch several videos with great sound, but my same model has absolutely no sizzle. No amount of tweaking the front plate or snare strings makes a difference. Just slapping a dead wooden box.	-1
Sorry but these are just stained red.  As they don't have a bright sound	-1
These definitely work and are very handy for powering a number of effects out of the back of your TU-2 and NS-2. That being said, the way the plugs are arranged is with a straight input. If you buy the One Spot version of this, the plugs are right-angled, taking up less space on your board. Further, I believe you can power one more effect and the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Visual-Sound-One-Spot-Multi-Plug-8-Cable/dp/B000XXBHA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Visual Sound One Spot Multi Plug 8 Cable</a>is cheaper	-1
I wrote this review a year ago "This is an unexpensive practice chanter and the sound is not specially great, but it's enough for a good start. I live in Costa Rica and, as you should've guess, it's impossible to find a bagpipe teacher in this country, but this product gave me the basic knowledge I needed to star learning to play."  I had to change my mind!!  At first I was having fun playing this thing but, when I started to play a little more seriously, I realized that this is not a good instrument if you really want to learn to play the bagpipes, it's samaller than the regular chanter and the quality of the sound is poor. I bought a Gibson long practice chanter for about 90 bucks and my playing skills realy improved.	-1
If you are serious about learning the bagpipes you are going to have to start out on a practice chanter.  This practice chanter is junk. It squeaks and sqawks like a sick goose! Buy a better chanter that costs about $80 or more.  Beleive me its worth the extra money!	-1
If you want to learn to play the pipes you need to buy a quality practice chanter from a reputable manufacturer. You also need too find a competent instructor.  Do yourself a favor and check out any local pipe bands, especially those who are members of competitive associations such.  Many such bands offer free instruction.  Some instruction is also available over the internet via Skype.  Otherwise, check with one of the many online piping specialty shops about a quality practice chanter, books, and videos. Local music shops may offer to help by ordering instruments, but are in reality clueless (ask if they play and for how long). Don't doom yourself from the beginning with cheap junk and poor or no instruction.	-1
I bought it and read the instructions carefully. The upper holes make a sound just fine but the lower holes do not change the pitch at all. Maybe they sent a bad reed? Doesn't look rosewood, is painted a flat black all over. Directions are hard to follow and shouldn't be since I have played music most of my life. The CD is music only and helps very little. I am going to have to buy another type or kind. I really do want to learn to play bagpipes.	-1
Always move around	-1
Nice features, terrible quality. The bag is great, and the board size was just perfect for the intended use, but the quality of the board itself was just awful. Unglued corners all over the place, even a missing piece of wood in one of them. Even before the first gig the board looks like it has taking a beating already. Sadly since I live in Mexico it would be too expensive to send it back, but I really regret this purchase.	-1
This is a very versatile unit that can be a portable base for many different applications. However, it is most ill-suited to its advertised function, namely, that of a keyboard stand. I bought the stand to use with a Yamaha Motif XF8, which is a heavy (appx 70 lbs) full sized 88 key workstation. I thought that the four legs and table platform would do the job for supporting such a keyboard. Not so. The legs are thin and appear fragile. They splay outwards, and during the short period of time that I allowed the XF to remain on top, I noticed the legs to slide, or at least shift position, on the hardwood floor. On top of that, whenever I played the Motif, I could feel the stand moving under the weight of the unit, and the additional pressure fluctuations of my playing. Like a frightened schoolboy with shaking knees, this one just couldn't take it. Maybe this stand can really hold its advertised weight, but I certainly wasn't going to wait and find out that it could not. Maybe a very light keyboard will be stable on top of this, or maybe a sewing machine or an ironing board, but not a large keyboard. I sent this one back.	-1
The balance of the throne is severly altered... ther's no way to have the seat leveled, with this attached... an I have placed it on a NEW double braced gibraltar throne.  It just doesn't feel solid... and back support is not that much better... plus it's heavy as hell I just removed it. THE ROC n  SOC is just so EXTREMELY BETTER (you can read my review on that one) ... it is both LIGHTER feels WAY more solid, doens't come undone... and it easier to attach... total no brainer... as far as drum seats go Roc n Soc is the choice... I wouldn't trade a sued one for two new ones.	-1
Not that good!	-1
DOESN'T REALLY WORK	-1
I bought this rosin because so many articles stated it was the  premier rosin to get for cello. When it came in, it separated from the holding  cloth. When I tried to etch the surface, it broke into many pieces..some  of them into fine shards that could not be used at all. I salvaged the one remaining big piece and applied it to my bow, and it did not make any difference in the sound that my cheap rosin was doing for me. I suspect it was old and dried out, but I wasn't going to buy another one to find out. I did buy another rosin product called Jade (see  my review). It was remarkable. The rosin stayed stuck to the cloth, was able to etch the surface, and screeches have been minimized to a lovely tone.	-1
tried both this and ardsley drops and neither worked on my horrible pegs.  sometimes you just need to replace the pegs themselves, but i didn't want to go through the hassle so i gave the instrument away.  buy this or ardsley at your own risk.  maybe others will have better luck.	-1
Had to return , #1 guitar didn't fit , #2 measure your guitar before buying	-1
Incorrect dimensions given here at Amazon and on Gator Case's website. It say the interior body height dimension is 3.5" and the interior lower bout dimension is 15". This case is FLAT, like an envelope.  There are no "sides" or "edges" to it at all.  Just two pieces of padded nylon with a zipper.  How could it possibly allow for a 3.5" body?:  Well, it can't.  My bass is less than 2" of body height and the lower bout is only 13" and yet my Dean EVO XM bass will not zip up in this case.  Very disappointed that I have to waste money on packing up and labeling yet another return due to false information provided by a manufacturer.	-1
The zips on this bag are extremely unreliable. In the first instance when carrying the bag in the vertical position the zips moved apart allowing my (flying V) guitar to fall out of the bottom causing minor damage. With this lesson learned I always zipped the bad to the zippers were at the top of the bag when carrying in the vertical position so not to have a repeat where the zippers move apart. However, the problem now is that zip splits open when carried vertically - this caused more damage to my V. I cannot recommend this bag to anyone wanting to protect their guitar	-1
Wasn't long enough to fit my bass as advertised. Very thin, almost no padding at all, & zipper rubs against end of headstock now. I can't fully close it. Too late to return it.	-1
Okay, the gig bag is, itself, great.  It's sturdy, well made, and feels durable.  The zippers are solid and easy to use.  But - and this is a big BUT! - there was no shoulder strap in the bag, when I opened it up.  The strap is pictured in the product photo, and I need one to make it a useable instrument carrier, as I use a wheelchair, and don't have an extra hand to grab the nicely stitched case handle.  I didn't find out until it was too late to send messages via Amazon's system, so I guess I'm stuck.  Check your order the day you receive it!!	-1
Bought this for my daughter's fender squier mini-strat.  I was concerned about the sizing when I bought online, but this fits the 3/4 sized guitar perfectly.  We pretty much just use this just for taking the guitar back and forth to guitar lessons.  It has a reasonable amount of padding and is easy enough for my seven year old to pack up and carry.  There is a large zipper pocket which is nice because it can fit her guitar lesson book as well as some guitar picks and a cable.  As some have noted, this type of gig bag isn't going to protect your guitar the same way a hard shell case would.  But for light duty hauling the guitar round or even stowing it at home, it will get the job done well enough.  I looked at three of four different bags, and thought the price for this was fair, not great.  --- EDITED REVIEW ---  So I had to edit this review and change my rating.  We got this gig bag as a Christmas present with the kid's guitar.  By June, the thing was falling apart.  The seam at the bottom of the bag has come undone and the guitar can slip out, so it would literally be safer for her just to carry it to lessons with no case at all.  This wasn't especially heavy use. She takes the bag once a week in the car to guitar lessons, really no reason for the bag to fall apart like this. Its possible I just got a defective case, but...?  Anyway, I hate to do it but I'm going to pay the extra $10 for the Fender 3/4 gig bag.  Hoping its not to late to return this one to Amazon!	-1
Decent case for the money, however this tiny bag will not fit your normal sized acoustic guitar...as I need to mail mine back unfortunately...	-1
didn't fit the floor tom leg brackets on my Gretsch catalina jazz	-1

This 14" bag fits very tight and the inside lining seam came apart, most likely because it was sewn improperly. Disappointed to say the least. Had used the bag 3 times.	-1

I would buy this harmanica for a child. It has a nice tone and it came in tune right out the box.	-1
It's an embarrassment with the Lexicon name on it. It's like puting a Lexus emblem on a Yaris. It works well at a great price, but so does the Behringer at a lower price.  The Tascam US2X2 and The Focusrite 2i4 are far better units, quailty wise and soundwise and are the best bang for the buck for someone who has an expectation of decent audio quality and craftsmanship quality.	-1
product works but it is not comparable with Cubase recording studio , so until I found this it was late to return it back to the seller, I both Focusrite and this product is working  grate with no issues at all,  but I wasted $125  with Lexicon Alpha, do not buy it, there are good products available on market!!!!	-1
They don't tell you that the Cubase software that comes with this is obsolete.  Cant even run on windows 7. Would be good if you still have a computer that runs XP	-1
Avoid this like a hooker with a running nose!	-1
Should I get it working I shall come back delete this review if possible or update. As of present it just appears to be a simple splitter. Microphone Jack plus one Instrument Jack. I've not had a chance to test the preamp for mic yet. You need a 1/4" plugin or the regular XLR 3 prong mic chord to plugin. Soon as I get that chord I will update how the mic jack works. For the price probably a little bit high if it is just a splitter box with no decent preamp. Being powered from the USB port with supposedly input/output which I not been able to get function yet, which I probably won't be able to get function as has been my experience when things don't work the 1st time not sure what else to say at this time unless some magic comes my way to show me something the instructions didn't. Think I covered every possibly so far and the only use I can find for it so far is just a peak meter. When it hits red I know I'm playing to loud. At this point I would say use simple splitters that match correctly and amp it a nice camera with a mic or line in plugin.	-1
But really you need the correct software to do anything . The software in this package is the worst iv ever had to deal with . , The studio has no other use to me besides a splitter . The software has three steps and you need to licence the software . If you lose the key-code you will never get another . Even if you have your key-codes like I do it will not except them . I don't write bad reviews ,But in this case I could have spent my money wisely . And just bought a software program . Live and learn .	-1
Please purchase a focusrite product, please. Even a Focusrite Saffire 6 USB interface will blow this puppy out of the water. Focusrite sounds a trillion times better in the low end and super high end frequencies. I can't believe I even wasted my time with this product. You pay for what you get for...	-1
I had high hopes for this given its specs and price, however, though it is said to be compatible with Windows XP, I couldn't get my rig to recognize it and load the drivers without which nothing worked. I called the tech people at Lexicon (Harman is the parent company) I was immediately connected with a knowledgeable engineer-type who listened to the symptoms, had me look in my device driver where we saw that it was listed, but not as an audio device. It was under "Other Devices."  "Ah." he said "That's the problem. XP doesn't recognize it for what it is and therefore won't load the drivers."  Encouraged by his astuteness, I asked, "OK, what's the workaround?"  He answered, "There isn't any. Windows was supposed to have fixed it in SR 3. Which version do you have?" "SR3," I told him. "Yeah," He sighed, "this comes up every once in a while. I'm afraid I can't help you. It's a Windows thing." "Really?" I whined, "Nothing you can do?" "Sorry. Everyone here in engineering has been talking about this since it first came up, but nobody's got a fix for it. Like I said, It's a Win..." "...dows thing," I sang along in harmony.  Left with no other recourse, since Windows online support naturally had nothing remotely close to helpful that I could find, I returned the item and purchased, for about 30 bucks more, (at 170) an m-audio firewire solo audio interface which I set up yesterday. I had a few awful moments when the blue screen of death kept appearing, after I'd installed the drivers and was trying to open my recording app, Sony Acid. But m-audio's extensive and well-organized knowledge base led me right to the problem: I had downloaded the most current drivers and installed them *after* I installed the older ones from the disc that came with the solo. The KB told me that is a big no-no and you must never install their drivers without first uninstalling the old ones. Once I cleaned that issue up, it started working like a charm. At least for some simple test vocal recordings. But I'm not reviewing the m-audio solo here, so I'll stop, with a warning to Win XP folks that you may, like me, be one of the unlucky few who run into the same "Windows Thing."  If anyone reading this does know a work-around for this issue, do everyone a favor and post it!	-1
Not what i was looking for	-1
I bought this phantom power supply to go in my pedal board for use with my LR Baggs ParaAcoustic DI that needs 48v phantom power to operate and for my Neumann KMS 105, in the rare instances that 48v phantom power is unavailable on a mixer for my vocal microphone or acoustic guitar.  All guitar pedals use a standard barrel size adapter...usually a 5.5mm x 2.1mm (center negative) barrel connector. This makes using daisy chains or multiple output isolated power supplies like the Voodoo Labs Pedal Power or the BBE SupaCharger (and the many others) a simple way to power ALL guitar pedals requiring 9-18v of power.  BE ADVISED - THIS UNIT DOES NOT ACCEPT A STANDARD SIZE (2.1mm) ADAPTER!	-1
OK	-1
I sold it after a year and got back about 1/2 what it cost.  The reason I got rid of it is that I found a much better guitar; actually, two that are far and away better than this "Martin."  First, the Takamine EGMini: absolutely excellent quality and tone, and it even has built-in electronics.  Second, and this is actually the one I recommend to anyone looking for a high quality student guitar, is the Mitchell MDJ10.  It must be made by Takamine because it has all the features of their better G-series models (high gloss finish, solid spruce top, bound rosewood fingerboard, third fret peghead joint that is reinforced by the fretboard and truss-rod, and excellent intonation all the way to the 17th fret).  The Mitchell sells for only 150 bucks!  I have mine set up now in Nashville tuning, which is the high octave of a 12-string.  But I've played it with extra light regular strings and it has very good tone.  What a great travel guitar!	-1
I work  at a professional haunted house and I usually use a couple fog machines outside in the wooded trail that we have. I have used everything from the walmart fog machines and juice to chauvet fog machines and high end fog juice.  Last year was my first year trying out froggys and I was excited because of all the hype they have. I also ordered a gallon of code 6 fog juice as well just in case I didn't like one or the other. The fog machine I used on both of them was a chauvet fog machine at 20,000 cfm. Also I diluted each for juice at 1:1 with distilled water and a splash of distilled white vinegar. This was recommended by froggy's to dilute the juice so it won't clog or ruin the fog machine. I also added in the vinegar to help keep things clean since chauvet's can die if not taken well care of.  Comparing this stuff to the cheaper walmart brand there is a difference. It's thicker, doesn't smell bad if at all and hang around more. However the code 6 lasted a lot longer than froggy's. both were used right after one another with minimal to no wind on the same night with the same temperatures in the same location. I also tried it the next night and use froggy's first to see if the machine temp had anything to do with it. Same results. The froggy's just didn't last for me outside. I haven't used it inside but I don't think there would be different results.  I would also like to point out that there are some internet trolls that froggy has or a couple fanboys of froggy's on amazon. My last review I recently took down since it saw too many people leaving negative responses toward it. It was an honest review just like this one and I wasn't being biased. Also I left a 5 star review for code 6 and was thanked by the seller but that is also getting negative reviews as well. Every review for code 6 is positive besides 2. And every positive review has 2 dislikes. I highly suspect froggys is jealous of their competition and trying to spam other reviews on their competition. It's not a coincidence that every single positive review has 2 thumbs down and 1 thumb up from people reading them.  I will never by froggys again and if I see someone with a fog machine I will point them in the opposite direction.	-1
When the item arrived, there was a light fret buzz on the G string that I assumed was from cheap strings. Today, I bought a strap and attempted to play while using the strap and the G string fret buzz is absolutely terrible.  The playing the G open is indistinguishable from playing the first fret; it is the EXACT SAME NOTE, and for noobs - thats not normal. Other people have mentioned the cheap sounding strings, etc. so I have already destroeyd the boxes this thing came in.  I will now have to pay MORE money to get this fret buzz problem fixed.  TLDR: DO NOT BUY THIS.  IT ARRIVED DEFECTIVE	-1
Perhaps I should say 'poor factory calibration' as I'd question how much handwork actually went into the instrument. Don't be fooled by the mahogany and spruce mentioned in the description. They're nothing but veneers over composites of what appear to be cheap boxwood, the kind you see in low-end violins. I found this out after disassembling the body to repair the bridge plate that was so misaligned the pin holes barely made contact with about 1/8 of an inch of the plate back edge. The notches in the X braces were cut too far up or the braces themselves mismatched.  After a few months I noticed the top was beginning to dome behind the bridge: a mirror revealed the plate edge was so chewed up as to provide almost no support, hence the bellying of the top.  Aside from this, there were cosmetic blemishes along the binding of the top and on the back of the neck.  I happen to enjoy tinkering with cheap instruments, which is the only reason I gave it two stars (plenty to work on!). But for someone looking for a solid, playable instrument, this bass is strictly low-budget and you get what you pay for.	-1
The SE Electronics Reflexion Filter gives home and location recordists a decent amount of control over unwanted ambient sound in a compact package.  At $150-$175 this unit would be well worth it, but at $300, I'd like to see a more robust stand mount, slightly larger surface area and a better counter balanced approach to rigging.  First the sound... I use the Reflexion in my small project studio to help isolate soloists, mostly horns, on small combo jazz tracks.  I don't have a soundproof vocal booth - just a 13' x 25' open studio with moveable acoustic partitions for isolation. Typically, we record live jazz performances and run the upright bass, electric piano or guitars direct, plus a second channel for each instrument that's mic'd. Since drums are played in the same room, there was a problem with too much bleed into the sax or trumpet players mic. Vocals, of course,  were even more problematic. By using the Reflexion, I'm able to get much better isolation and clean up the tracks for superior control during mixdown. However, I find that one must also place a acoustic foam baffle behind the soloist to block reflected sound from behind the player/vocalist - the SE parabola just doesn't knock it down far enough by itself.  In a relatively small space, the Reflexion doesn't block drum set sounds sufficiently, unless you surround the kit with additional foam barriers and/or plexiglass shields... then the SE Electronics Reflexion can get you in the ball park for ambient control, and will slightly improve isolation on "softer" vocal tracks. It actually works better on stage, where the small parabolic surface doesn't visually interfere with the musicians eye contact with other players and the audience as much as other devices would. Horn players don't object to blowing into one of these units and it will surely improve live recordings in this situation. Finally, the "C clamp" mounting doesn't hold the filter, rigging and most studio condenser mics that well - the unit tends to tilt and sag.  More importantly, it is not a well-balanced device and that requires you mount it on a heavyweight mic stand, or use sand bags at the base to prevent having the whole rig and an expensive mic crash to the floor... use caution.  FOLLOW-UP The more I use this device, the more I dislike the mounting arrangement. It only gets looser and less secure the longer you own it... took it from three stars (it works fine) down to two because of the poor mounting clamps and top heavy design.	-1
I received the 12 Fret Ultimate Guitar Chord Rubber Stamp and the large and mini chord rubber stamps as a gift. All three stamps were mounted crooked on their wood blocks making them just about impossible to get straight on paper. Absolute sloppy workmanship. I have no complaint about the Ink It Up! stamp pad.	-1
How do you screw up such a simple product? Simple ... glue the stamp onto the the wood block crooked.	-1
normally not upset with anything I have received from amazon, but now we have a different story. this chord stamp is half the size of a postage stamp.!!  you couldn't see the lines or the frets to note a cord.. the one I need is much larger. I could not imagine using this. got to be the worst purchase I have ever made.	-1
too small	-1
When they say MINI.. this is TINY TINY TINY. If I ink it, it would fit perfectly on the end of my finger. I am not sure how you would see it while practicing unless you have a magnifier handy. If I could I would exchange it for the larger size. I am not HAPPY and don't think I can get any use out of it at all.	-1
Junk. Showed broken.	-1
I was expecting too much for my money. One of the tubes was dented, finish pretty bad. I'm glad I only bought it for a practice kit.	-1
sent me a blank piece of wood.	-1
First off, this product will provide you with a somewhat clean way of getting audio into your computer (although there is a bit of tube noise in there, which is preferred by some for its sound), only it will be at a very low level. The downside is that it doesn't work well with all microphones.  Dynamic mics are not a good match with this unit.  I have to push in the +20db switch and turn both the gain and output nobs almost fully to the right in order to get enough gain. With that, it works fine, though. There isn't much room to tweak for just the right adjustments.  This product is OK with condenser mics, and doesn't exhibit the same gain issues it does with Dynamic mics, but I am still not overly impressed with the overall amount of gain on this unit.  My cheap Behringer board has far more gain than the ART.  It's not even a contest.  This does "warm up" your voice somewhat because it has a tube.  Sometimes, I think the bass almost sounds slightly more muddy, but after a while, I have come to like it, provided I have it set correctly.  That's it.  It's not a miracle product that's going to make you sound like a $1,000 amp.  If you're looking for tube distortion, this product is not what you want, because you don't have the adjustments necessary to get the type of sound you're looking for.  I purchased this expecting some tube improvement and warmth.  I got some more warmth, but I'm disappointed with the lack of ability to use it with a dynamic mic easily.  Is it better than my Behringer audio board?  Hmm... it depends on the task I'm using it for.  Someone said that you need to spend a chunk of change in excess of $500 for some, and $1,000 for most preamps to get a "real" tube sound.  I now believe it.	-1
I bought it for a piece of sound processing equipment I had no adapter for figuring it was a great idea, but sure was wrong.  I set it to the proper settings and plugged it in... BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ! You get the picture...  The power generated by this item was definitely not of the same standard as ANY other adapter I have ever used.  Also another reviewer mentioned this product almost set fire to their house...  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT it is cheaply made and unsafe.  Spend a bit more for to protect your electronics and maybe even save yourself from a house fire.	-1
I bought these for my mobile DJ business. I didn't expect the best, but I expected them to work until I got more business in. They worked only once when I tested them. The red was a little static, but I thought I'd just use the green for wireless and have the red corded and as backup. Well, it turns out I finally needed the microphones for a gig. My first complete wedding. What a mistake! Not only was the red one worse than before. The green one was muffled and had feedback both with and without the wireless adapter. I was so embarrassed. Don't buy these for your business. It's too risky of a proposition and may end up costing you more than the price for the item itself.	-1
It doest sound crispy clear	-1
BE WARNED.  I am disappointed over-all. The light functions well and rotates to the beat of music just fine, but the product description does not tell you it overheats quickly and needs to be shut off after 10 minutes so it can cool off for 10 minutes, and so on.  Because these are halogen bulbs and get very hot quickly, the manufacturer recommeds a usage pattern of "10 minutes on, 10 minutes off."  For what I need, this is extremely high-maintenance. I am a karaoke host and just wanted a light that would flash for a 4-5 hour show.  I can't be going back and forth making sure this light isn't overheating every 10 minutes turning it on and off. I called the manufacturer and they recommended I buy one of their light controllers which will time it automatically (which costs more than the light itself).  I guess if you were a DJ who had a big light show and you had the controller anyway, this might work for you.  But if you're looking for a single light just to accent a small stage, look elsewhere.	-1
DO NOT GET! My lights are evenly spread and still sags in the middle! Get the ADJ LIGHT BRIDGE DURA TRUSS! It is sooooooo much better!!	-1
I ordered this and one of the plastic T-junctions was broken when it arrived.  I had an old, beat-up stand with parts, so I pulled one off to replace it, and it did the job.  But I wouldn't use this to mount metal lights.  For lightweight plastic PAR 64 LEDs, I'm sure it will be just fine.	-1
I am a DJ and I used it approx 4 times and it has already malfunctioned. The sound activation does not work and I can only use it in still mode now, which defeats the purpose of having a dance light. It is only good for small rooms that hold 50-75 people (standing/dancing)with little to no light present. If the space is any bigger than that and has any light in it at all, forget it. There is no on or off switch which is annoying. If you need a light for more than 2- 3 hours at a time, spend the extra $60 and get a better light than this one. The American Pro Jelly Fish looks like a good light for a little over $110 so I'll try it and update my review.	-1
The effect that this light creates is AMAZING, even compared to a few LED lights I've acquired. I only wish there was a no-duty-cycle LED version available; I had it running while sitting on my table instead of hanging at one gig and I smelled smoke. It didn't ignite, but dang, this thing gets HOT.  If you have a timer, this might be fine. But otherwise, I'd highly recommend you look for LED lights.	-1
BE WARNED.  I am disappointed over-all. Not only is this NOT a sound-activated light (there is a speed controller but it did not respond at all to music) but the product description does not tell you it overheats quickly and needs to be shut off after 10 minutes so it can cool off for 10 minutes, and so on.  Because these are halogen bulbs and get very hot quickly, the manufacturer recommeds a usage pattern of "10 minutes on, 10 minutes off."  For what I need, this is extremely high-maintenance. I am a karaoke host and just wanted a light that would flash for a 4-5 hour show.  I can't be going back and forth making sure this light isn't overheating every 10 minutes turning it on and off.

But if you're looking for a single light just to accent a small stage, look elsewhere.	-1
I used this light for 3 shows and it no longer spins. I have not taken it apart to find out why. It was allways sticky and i had to spin it by hand to get it going. Its cheap but u would spend the money elswhere. 2 stars because it worked good for 2 shows.	-1
This isn't what I had hoped it would be. Literally after seconds, this thing was too hot to touch and it smelled as it something was burning, I had just turned it on and in less than 5 seconds it was so hot, that when I grabbed it, it burned my hand. Plus, its a very boring fixture, all it does it spin around in a circle and it's too noisy. The description in the website didn't specify any of this characteristics.	-1
Garbage. The pickups stopped working after a month. It sounds like sh! t on my tube amp, horrible. I'm comparing it to my $300 Schecter - which blows this thing out of the water. Pass. Sorry guys, but it IS a cheap one.	-1
Does not fit Floyd Rose II as advertised - Had to return	-1
I looks nice, but as soon.as you play it. The paint start chipping away. Don't bother buying this product. BUYER BEWARE.	-1
The BR-600 is a useful machine, but there are some limitations. The 8 tracks are actually 4 unique tracks and 2 stereo tracks. This is limiting when recording back up guitar, two drum tracks, bass and then, oops, out of tracks, have to mix down. The unit uses 1G Flash Memory or smaller. You can't use a larger capacity memory. 1G will fill up after 5 or 6 songs if you've recorded a few takes and mixed down a few times. The unit comes with a 256M chip that won't last long. At $50 - $60 each the 1G memory chips will eat up a lot of cash. Also, the 1G Flash chips are getting hard to find since most consumers want larger memory capacity for newer devices.  For about $50 more than the new BR-600 you can pick up the Fostex MR-16HD. This machine has a 40G hard drive. It also has 8 unique inputs, with 4 stereo tracks. A similar problem to the BR-600, but 8 tracks give you much more versatility than 4.  I'm going to keep my BR-600 to use to record rehearsals and live gigs, but I'll rely on the Fostex for studio work.	-1
the hair on the bow is not adjustable we cannot play it without a proper bow	-1
I have to give this cello only two stars because, despite the many good things one could say about it, I have discovered an unexpected defect that makes it impossible to give a better rating.  The good things:  good finish (but darker than pictured), solid woods, well-shaped bridge (which still needed lowering and reshaping a bit), excellent pegs and tailpiece (I wanted a cello with the rosewood fittings), and very good endpin.  The hard case and the soft case that came with it were both good-enough quality.  The bad things: the varnish used is fake-glossy and has visible but small blemishes; the supplied strings are useless; and (worst of all) the back of the cello for about 8 inches on either side of the endpin had never been glued to the sides but showed a 1/16 inch air gap (and actually did not fit the sides quite right).  This last fault I did not discover till I had been playing it for a couple of months (adult beginner, experienced with violin, viola, guitar).  I would have returned it if I had noticed this fault right away.  I suspect that Cecilio's quality control is not up to par with student instruments available from other vendors.  One would much prefer a better-made cello with fewer accessories for this price point.	-1
My original review grew to 3+ Screens of text, and I had as well uploaded a video too -- OMG! :-). I removed all of that.  Moreover, I had accumulated many pictures documenting the issues as requested by Cecilio for review----lots of time spent on this Christmas Gift Purchase.  I then attempted to revise this review here a couple of times as I worked thorough the return, replacement process. However, I could not keep the narration of the experience accurate in brief as appropriate for this context.    -- So, I'll just leave the 1-Star concerning this  However, kudos to Amazon's Staff! who implement and make real the Business Process/Enforced Customer Advocate Policies concerning providing a safe buying experience nonetheless----it's why I've been a daily customer for nearly a decade. Best regards to all.	-1
Low E and A went dead in 10 minutes	-1
Haven't tried them yet. But, I like DR strings anyway but can't give them 5 stars until I install them, SORRY!	-1
Product wat too large for a 76-not keyboard. Do not buy this unless you want your keyboard bouncing around like pinball in a bag that could literally hold two of them.	-1
I wish I could give no star at all. This is not only slim, it is too tiny and not long enough. Pure waste.	-1
The height adjustment pins have a hard time fitting in the hole because they won't retract far enough. Got to bang it in.  Works ok otherwise.  But it's a pain to use.	-1
Product arrived with bent tubular steel foot. Rocks terribly.	-1
I am a professional musician and was gonna use this for a chair during my acoustic solo gigs. I thought it looked comfy and had a good price point. But after just using it 2 times and being careful loading in and out the seat cover was torn. All they have to do is use a burlap type cover and this would not be a issue...	-1
I bought this for my Larrivee 12 string, with high expectations. It does not work! No matter how it is adjusted, the smaller gauge E and A strings are not depressed. I am stuck with it because I didn't keep the packaging - I foolishly thought this 'premier' capo would work. It is pathetic!! Keep away.	-1
I had heard wonderful things about this capo, but I have a 12-string Rainsong, and the capo was not strong enough to work properly.  The strings all buzzed.  Fortunately, I had no problem returning it at Amazon.	-1
First, I love the G7th 6 string capo.  It's a miracle.  I was so anxious to get the 12 string version.  When I did I simply cannot get it to fret all of the strings.  I'm using it on a Taylor 855CE, tuned a step low, with medium Elixer strings.  The problem is on the higher pitched octave strings.  The capo's rubber doesn't seem to yield enough to allow it to reach the narrower width octave strings, the rigidness on the wider strings don't allow it to  press the octave strings to the fret without enormous pressure, and even then, sometimes I can't get a clean sound.  I've considered trying to modify it by cutting or burning the rubber, but I'm afraid I would ruin it, and it has found a place in another 6 string case where it works perfectly (hence 2 stars instead of 1).  If they ever address this problem, I'd buy one in a second, but I feel pretty burned on a very expensive capo.	-1
Got it to working and then it stoped working the next time I tried it, can't figure what happened	-1
Hate to give a bad review for a good product, but no support from the manufacturer is inexcusable. A product like this needs good customer support in order for installation to be successful. I give one star because of the product which I finally was able to get working but only because some very smart person posted links to the needed updated drivers, and links to 'how to' and settings to get this working in Logic Pro X.  Come on people (at wherever this is supposed to come from) get off your duffs and help your customers or sell the business to someone who cares.  Let me add, that if this product included updated and proven software downloads to fix the problem, there would be no problem. As it is, the manufacturer website has sketchy and difficult to search out, patches and fixes that address the Logic Pro X software and then also updates to the driver for Faderpro, none of which fix the problem of most of the controls not working or being addressed from within Logic Pro X.	-1
This is an update to my previous review of this product. I had my Faderport working with Cubase 5 - when I initially got it about a year and a half ago. Then all of a sudden, for no given reason, the motorized fader stopped working. I thought I'd upgrade the firmware. Contrary to my expectations, things got much worse - half of the controls stopped responding.  A few weeks ago I upgraded my DAW to Cubase 8. The Faderport thing stopped working altogether. You see a button or two lit up when the machine is running, but the unit is non-responsive. No driver updates, no fixes whatsoever are available on Presonus.com. I am tired and frustrated with this thing. Searched everywhere on the web for solutions, found none that worked so far. I hear some guys have had luck with old drivers, but all they were able to do was to get this thing to work with limited functionality.  BOTTOM LINE: The idea behind this device is absolutely brilliant. I got it along with an external pedal to punch myself in/out when recording - a great solution when you record alone, both hands are busy playing and nobody else is around to help. No device on the market comes even close to this functionality and price point, yet the software is useless. Might have to sell this thing and move on with something else. If anyone has any advice for an alternative device with the above functionality, I'd appreciate you mentioning it.	-1
Would be a cool device if it worked I'm sure. Unfortunately the only way to run it in cubase 6, 7 and 7.5 is in HUI mode which makes it totally unusable with a large number of tracks. HUI is an old protocol and not really in use any more. Even Avid has abandoned it. If persons would update a 64 bit driver I'm sure this cheap controller would rock. I remember having to contact persons about my monitor station and never heard back. I didn't even bother this time. This particular unit also arrived with broken power supply which would make the fader move. Will have to go with the CC 121 from Steiny.	-1
So, it's a great idea, but the PreSonus FaderPort is a piece of junk. I know, I know, that's what most of the reviews say. (Well, not here at Amazon, but just about everywhere else.) But I figured that I'd give it a try. Seriously, it doesn't work with Logic and my colleagues tell me it doesn't work with ProTools. What's left? Oh.. yeah, you could probably use it with PreSonus' software, and, if you are an amateur, that may be enough for you. What do I mean by "it doesn't work?" I mean that, with a lot of tinkering, you can get it set up and working. BUT, after you take all the time to do that, and you switch projects, or GOD-FORBID unplug your FaderPort or any other usb midi equipment you have plugged in, you will have to quite our of Logic, dig back into your preference, set it up again as if it is brand new, JUST to get it working again.  It just stinks!!!  Anyway, I don't want you to think I'm a brand hater. Actually, I LOVE my PreSonus mixers. (We have two StudioLive mixers, and they are AMAZING.) But, truth be told, I do very much dislike PreSonus. Their customer service is absolutely terrible. One of the WORST companies to work with in the history of bad companies. They don't answer their phone. They don't answer their emails. They don't have the current drivers up on their website for download. Really, they just stink. The SECOND Mackie or Yamaha makes a mixer that is comparable to the StudioLive, I will sell my PreSonus mixer just so I don't ever have to talk with them again. (Or should I say... wait on hold indefinitely and then get help from somebody that doesn't really know what they are talking about.)  So, do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy the PreSonus Faderport.  RESIST the tempatation. IT DOES NOT WORK!!!! On the other hand, my AxiomPro25 by M-Audio is an example of a product that works BEAUTIFULLY. Always. It always just works. Just like it should. No matter what.	-1
not that good	-1
It does allow you to add echo and reverb to your singing.  However, it does not do anything close to what it says it will do.  I'm talking about removing the vocal parts of music so that you can sing karaoke.	-1
JUst for the voice..it sounds good, BUT IT NEVER GOT RID OF THE VOCALS. Even i changed it for another....it did the same. I'm keeping it because for my backing tracks my vouce sounds better. But dissapointed....	-1
I have bought other Behringer products similar to this one and they work fine for the price but the minimix karaoke machine is a low quality equipment and it doesnt deliver for the price. maybe if it wasn't that expensive but its not worth the money... but be my guest and try it, youll be karaokeing sad songs in no time...jajajajaja!1!!!	-1
I'm editing my original post because the mixer is now emitting a horrible noise coming from the FX processor. I was in the middle of a high profile gig in Malibu and was so embarrassed by this mixer failing. Gear fails. I get it. But doing some research online, there's so many people with Behringer mixers that have the exact same issue.  I wrote Behringer. Hopefully they'll replace the unit.  I'd look elsewhere.	-1
I have a Behringer personal monitor which works well, but this unit was defective right out of the box. There was a nasty noise (not subtle at all) which developed after being on for a few minutes. I really like the format and size, but I just didn't feel confident in the quality control of the brand to go for a replacement. I ended up spending more money for a replacement item, but have had Mackies for years without any problems and so went with one of them.	-1
Needs a 3 band per channel eq instead of extra sends on each channel. Needs a 3 band per channel eq instead of extra sends on each channel. Needs a 3 band per channel eq instead of extra sends on each channel.	-1
Disappointment all around, came w cracked toggle cap, unlevel frets, feels light and cheap, pickups are weak and even after replacing them the tone was weak, junk guitar, I sold it off for $50, lesson learned, double your money and get a real guitar..	-1
I was very disappointed with this purchase and had to return it, the guitar had cracks where the neck connects to the body and a crack under the front pickup. I loved the body style of the guitar and the price, but unfortunately it was damaged. Your experience if you've ordered the item may be different from mine, at least I would hope so, to avoid the deep disappointment I felt.	-1
[...]. I was very excited initially, to convert 100+ professionally mixed 90 minute cassettes from the days that I owned a chain of dance clubs. I have always worried about them deteriorating since there are many cuts that were from artists in both rock and r&B, which are totally inaccessible today. I suspect from the many 5 star reviews that this might be a good product but my experience was extremely frustrating. I am pretty electronically savvy and have been using PC's since 1993. Plugged Inport Deluxe into my USB port on a Dell laptop running Vista (high powered system with 4 gig of RAM and plenty of horsepower). At any rate, the user manual is confusing, incomplete, and not in synch with Vista. During set up, several of the screen prompts that they said I would see, with the expected drop down menus in Vista, were not accurate in the "manage audio devices". Xitel was "out to lunch", telling you what to enable and disable. Vista has Sigmatel Hi Def Audio Codec speaker drivers and when asked to disable the speakers Xitel listed something totally different. So I just ignored the discrepancy and moved on through the setup instructions. I spent 4 hours trying to figure this system out, due to the discrepancies. It is not intuitive at all, so you just go with the flow and hope it works.  I was finally able to download a 90 minute cassette, but then it was a real chore trying to find the darned thing on the laptop. I always had to go into the "Find" C:\Cassettes, which was the file name I gave the folder in which I was going to store all my downloads. There is no way to create a shortcut from LPRecorder and LPRipper so that you can access them from your desktop. You have to keep going into the Start menu "All Programs" every time you want to use Inport. After I burned the cassette to my hard drive, I discovered that my soundcard was disabled (forever). Xitel hijacked my system and would not give it back to me. When I went back into Control Panel /"Hardware and Sound" /Manage Audio Devices...my soundcard speaker system had disappeared. It did not show up at all, in order to allow me to re-enable it so that I could listen to what I had just downloaded. After an hour of trying to recover my soundcard I got frustrated and un-installed all three of the Xitel programs. But even then I had no sound so I had to do a complete system Restore from a week earlier to get my system back to where it was before Xitel jacked it up. Unfortunately lost a few things that I had done in the meantime.  [...].	-1
Yeah I thought this thing was amazing for about a week, after that I took off the headphones and hooked it up to an Amp, all of the tone and volume is just completely sucked out when this pedal is in use I tried to go through the setting and try to fix it but then it would make my amp just squell a really high pitched ring, so I reset it to factory settings a few times and tried and tried this pedal is great for practice but once you plug it up get ready to turn your amp up even louder, The bass pre-settings are very awful it claims to model other amp Models, Well it doesn't...  The Description says "The Zoom B2 Bass Multi Effects Pedal features the new ZFX3 processor loaded with 9 preamp/cabinet and 5 stomp box models faithfully accurate to the originals in every way."  Faithfully Accurate is the wrong word for it when I started using the pedal I couldn't get much volume for anything, I also wanted to use it as a tuner and turn all the effects off but theres no setting for that either it still sucks all your volume out!  "Many conventional pedal effects make the low end sound thin and lifeless." Well this pedal takes your Low end and makes it sound like an over compressed volume reduced low end MP3 terrible! low end  I love how the description tries to tell you what other pedals do wrong when this pedal does everything wrong the only thing it does perfectly is tune, I have had no problem what so ever tuning the low b string, as with other tuners I have had don't do so well, with headphones on this makes a perfect practice tool but thats the only reason it gets 2 stars but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone	-1
I HAVE NEVER USED AN EFFECTS DEVICE BEFORE SO IT IS HARD FOR ME TO COMPARE IT WITH OTHER MODELS.  I FOUND THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL TO BE VERY HARD TO FOLLOW.  IT COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN MUCH SIMPLER AND IN MORE DETAIL.  I PROBABLY WILL NEVER USE THIS DEVICE BECAUSE I CAN'T GET IT TO WORK PROPERLY WITH MY AMP.  I ALSO GOT THE FOOT PEDAL THAT TURNS THE EFFECTS OFF AND ON.  WHEN I AM PLAYING NORMALLY AND THEN STEP ON THE FOOT PEDAL, THE VOLUME IS AT LEAST 10 TIMES LOUDER.  IF I SET THE EFFECTS VOLUME TO A COMFORTABLE LEVEL AND THEN TURN IT OFF  THE NORMAL SOUND IS SO LOW I CAN'T HEAR IT.  I  LOOKED THROUGH THE MANUAL BUT FOUND NOTHING REGARDING THIS VOLUME ADJUSTMENT.  IT ALSO SEEMS VERY CUMBERSOME TO EDIT SOUNDS EFFECTS.	-1
Didnt screw onto my 58 all the way... but I only got it for the foam	-1
It was very disheartening to open a small package about 5 inches by 5 inches big and find easily under 5 dollars worth of cable with connectors that I just paid 79 dollars for? Seriously? Add the fact I thought this was some George Lynch endorsed due to the name George L's... my fault I got duped. These things are way over priced! Seriously do yourself a favor and get the normal well shielded pedal cables and save yourself a ton of money. Yeah sure you can custom size them, sure they are have zero noise but for 80 buck? No! 45 tops! I feel ripped off. Lower your price and change your name before lynch sues you.	-1
Bought this product because a friend recommended it, but despite that the plugs are good quality cables apparently not, since I'm using these types of cables have had many problems apparently sound cables are very delicate and tend to break and the guitar does not sound or loose gain pedals sound, apparently goes only part of the signal. Is a product that does not work well I went back and buy cables and rubber lining gets out as if stay loose cable. and I still have problems with the sound and when this happens I have to identify which is the cable having trouble removing them and testing them one by one until you find one that is bad. I would not recommend this product to Satan.	-1
When it works the sound is good, but there is no dramatic difference from the usual $99 microphone.  At a little over a year old, it just cuts out in volume, pops for no reason, and is just not reliable for recording.  It never went anywhere outside my home studio and even had it's own stand.  Never dropped or mishandled in any way--nobody touched it but me.  I have mics that are 5 to 20 years old that I use in my studio constantly, do get dropped and fumbled all the time, and they all work perfectly.  Maybe it's just my turn to get a bad one and has nothing to do with it	-1
I bought one of these as a cheap version of the DBX mic to use with my PA+ speaker processor. It does not play well with that system. The Behri mic is much hotter than the DBX, and subsequently throws off the processors calculations. Do not use as a DBX system analyzer!!!	-1
Sold it on Ebay	-1
The product is fine, but I had to pay for shipping twice since I assumed they come in pairs.  So I overpaid when i didn't need to.  Amazons fault for not being clear and not having anywhere to talk to someone about it.  It did not say anywhere this is for one record or for two and of course it was only 1.  When I ordered a second one, it came from a diff manufacturer and had different packaging and more shipping fees.  Feels like hit or miss sometimes with Amazon.  I guess thats what you get when you order from computers and humans are nowhere to be found.	-1
The stitching holding the velcro on the handle came apart.  The stitching on the seam where the top panel meets the right side/end fabric came loose and is slowly becoming a larger hole. The stitching for the identification card holder came apart. I purchased this bag 9 months ago and use it as a utility bag for 1/4" and XLR cables, mic, extra strings. I'm a gigging musician and probably open and close this bag 3 nights a week. It does not see extreme conditions and I am careful to take care of my things. I am quite displeased with this product. $40 bag and it hasn't lasted a year. This has been the first time and will be the last time I purchase and use an Arriba product. I am currently attempting to contact them and see if they will refund my money, or replace the defective bag.	-1
I've liked some of their cases, but they just aren't as strong or durable as I would like. You can only use them for lightweight objects. Anything heavy will tear out the seams. Better reinforcement at the stitching would improve these bags greatly	-1
Like the other reviewer who gave this a 1-star rating, I bought one of these to use for recording my rock band's performances, but it's completely unusable for that purpose.  This microphone simply cannot handle bass frequencies in loud live music without completely distorting, even with the 80Hz high-pass enabled.  Now I have to buy something else and resell this P.O.S.  [UPDATE] I took a chance on the Rode Stereo Video Mic *Pro* ($50 more) based on the other 1-star reviewer.  Received it and did a quick A/B test.  I cranked my PA system really loud in my rehearsal space, set the camera about 2 feet in front of the subs, and recorded some with each mic.  The difference is incredibly.  The SVM distorts like crazy, and the SVMPro doesn't distort at all.  If you want to record live music, the SVMPro is definitely the way to go.	-1
Actually, it is marked "By Trophy Music" in a very obvious place. Please upload the right picture. Note that this product is exactly the same as the one provided by another amazon seller, but that one is cheaper.	-1
Not a good low end, have alot distortion for a monitor. The crowning jewel is that after barely a month of LITE use the right speaker blew! FOR NO REASON! I have had these speakers for around 6 months and for the first 5 they were just sitting in my to be studio that was the storage room. I finally got my studio set up and everything working. I have been using them for use learning komplete and maschine and watching you tube tutorials, not even music videos or anything crazy, then while playing with the maverick, A PIANO INSTRUMENT!, the right speaker poped and was done. It literally popped I've blown plenty of speakers and for good reasons and never have I heard it sound like it was about to explode when it! As for the 3 year warranty sure behringer said they will fix it but the cheapest I found  for a 25lb box that big enough is around $60 to get it to vegas were the only warranty center in the US is. So I'm paying the price of a better set now for a cheap set that doesn't sound that great to begin with and broke because a piano was apparently to hard for them! Save yourself the trouble and get a higher end set. I bought a huge amount of behringer eq and so far everything I've used has broken and I bought $3500 worth in one go, stay away from behringer!	-1
It does amplify the signal really but noise comes with it. :( Lots of ground noise even though it is grounded.	-1
Sounds alright. One time, I was playing a gig, I stepped on this... nothing. It cut the signal overall. I haven't put this in my live signal chain since. I kept playing it after that on my own but it would seem to kill my signal whenever it felt like it. I'm sure EHX makes other pedals that are probably great but this is not one of them.	-1
The pedal gives way more than enough boost. It does make an audible pop noise when stepped on. Aaaaand, it took a crap and quit working. Not happy.	-1
After 3 months of gigging with this I went to stomp it on for my solo and... nothing. The pot gets sticky and you never know if you're going to get it to work or not. Which is not good when it's soul purpose in life is to make your solo stand out! Very embarassing and frustrating. But EH is known for bad quality parts on the ElNano series, so I guess I should have known better. I switched to the Boss Booster/Feedback pedal and have been MUCH happier. Not only is the footswitch design flawless, but the extra feature of feedback when you want it has given me a new dimension in my lead parts!	-1
I tested this pedal on a Mesa/Boogie Triple Rectifier and 4x12 cab setup.  This pedal works great if you are boosting on a clean channel or lightly distorted channel where you have alot of headroom for a gain increase.  However if you are already in a high gain metal distortion situation stepping on this pedal doesnt have any volume effect, as you have no more headroom to boost into. This is not the pedals fault, but it is important to remember if the pedal doesnt appear to boost volume, you are simply out of headroom and your amp's preamp is going into compression. (atleast thats how it works with tube amps, couldn't say about solid state)  This pedal does seem to boost your low end frequency quite a bit, which can be good or bad depending on your style, but I like my boost transparent and to have no effect on my tone, so i did return this to amazon. If you want a pedal that gives a boost without changing the tone, look for something else because this does boost your low to low mid range freq. Aside from that it is quiet (In regards to feedback and hum) and functional. Doesnt effect tone when bypassed.	-1
This product has very poor drivers...I had to install the drivers with all my antivirus/system protection software disabled to get it to work with internet and general audio files. I tried to watch a DVD and Windows disabled the driver (again) so it worked with one or two audio sources not internet or DVD...Rebooting does not solve the problem. Once disabled by windows the driver is done...I suspect if I disabled all protection from software having carte blanch to control my system it might work with all but DVD Audio sources. This is unacceptable...I will not disable my anitvirus and system protection permanently to record, master or listen to audio , or use my old interface to watch DVDs or master DVD audio which would make the most use of the performance of the interface....This is just pure junk of a driver. My old interface worked with anything what so ever I threw at it with no setup or special considerations. My old interface is flat out plug and play ....This interface the EMU 0404 is not plug and play in any translation of the term. For $200 I expect total functionality...I am heart broken. This unit looks like one of the best made...But it won't work so it is useless...I tried for hours with various set ups and installs to get it to work....AND LET ME express this to you. I am a recording engineer and bought this for my home projects outside of the very professional studio I work in. I totally know what I am doing and just can't get this Driver to work....Don't buy this if you have premium anti virus software from McAfee and Windows Vista Premium.....	-1
We hosted a seminar at my job so my boss gave me $400. I bought this, a stand and a cable. Plugged it into the mixer and it seemed to work so I left for the night. The next day the seminar speaker used it. He stood 20 feet away from the receiver. When he walked further than 20 feet or behind anyone or anything (such as a pillar) it dropped. I stopped the seminar in the middle of 300 guests to switch channels. no luck. I stopped him again to switch frequencies. No luck. When it was over the president came up to me and said, "You ruined the event." I took full responsibility but no, I didn't ruin it, Shure ruined our event with the cheapest piece of junk I've ever laid eyes on in my 30 years of doing audio. As a graduated audio engineer, I've worked with hundreds of mics and systems in my lifetime. In all my life I have never ever seen or held a cheaper mic in all my life. This garbage isn't suited to give to your 2 year old to play with in the car. It's featherlight and feel like it's made of thin plastic with nothing inside. The receiver is super thin and cheaply made. The mic is equally thin and light as if it is a toy. What the heck was I thinking? I'll never ever buy another sure product as long as I live and neither should you. Sure sold out and now they simply suck. They now specialize in selling cheap dollar store junk. What a horrible terrible product experience. Shure, you used to be such an amazing company with a rich audio history, why did you sell your soul to the devil? You ruined my reputation because I banked on you. I won't make that mistake again.	-1
I used this at a presentation and the receiver was only 20 feet from the transmitter. The audio would cut out several times in a short period. I tried several channels as well with no luck. This item was returned for refund.	-1
I like deals, but this had no power, no bite	-1
While I believe the mechanism is the same for most mechanical  metronomes, the plastic cabinet on this unit creates a noise that will drive you to drink!!  The volume is not adjustable.....and even if it were, the plastic case resonates the HORRIBLE  sound.  Buy an electronic metronome.	-1
It's crap, don't buy it. It had one job, stay on beat so I can. But it failed me. Goodbye and good riddance.	-1
The winding piece has come off through gradual use, and cannot be put back in place. My kid's piano instructor says this maybe a faulty piece as it seemed loose to begin with, and now suggested to return it for an exchange. Unfortunately it is past the 30 day window and Amazon does not permit exchanges either! While returns maybe dis-allowed, atleast exchanges should be allowed for genuinely faulty equipment.	-1
To difficult to use	-1
This instrument worked for 15 minutes and then went all over the place with uneven and untimed beats.  I sent it back and got a good quality used one off E-Bay.	-1
this looks really cool but the recording has so much buzzing in it i could not even use it i wood suggest something with a 64bit at90ish hz that dosent  suck you can get one for the same price gust minus the mixer	-1
based on many positive reviews and personal experience with Behringer keyboard amp (with built in 4 stereo channels mixer), i ordered one of these from GC online. Shipping is fast, but right out of the box, this unit produces a hum when connected to any of the 3 sound systems I have, the more volume I turn ON, the louder is the hum. I returned it immediately to a local GC which promptly refund me in full. The bad thing is GC does not sell the one they have as a demo unit, and no extra one to replace either. I guess this is a Quality Control issue of the manufacturer (China) which did not perform a final test on each unit that comes out their production line. I envy the buyers who are lucky to get a good working unit. Well, I ordered one Mackie brand (Mix12FX, similar functionalities), crossing my fingers that this one comes in good. Again, GC does not want to sell me the demo unit as they only have one in store !!!	-1
To make a long story short. Nothing works right on this mixer. L&R knobs do nothing, volume pots went out and all of a sudden the FX pots turned into volume control. What's next? Burn down the house? This thing was obviously wired and soldered by an 8 year old anxious to go out for a smoke!	-1
VERY VERY HOT.	-1
Keeps shutting down on me. And there is no power on/off switch. Wish I could send it back but I had it for a month before I hooked it up. Not happy with this product at all.	-1
Why did this order arrive with no Behringer box or manual, just a mixer and power cord in a bag.	-1
i would have given this thing 5 stars but i barely used it and it just stopped working one day. i tried to call the company about it and they didn't want to send me a replacement. When it worked it was an amazing product, but because of poor customer service I'm going to have to give them a bad rating.	-1
not comfortable because the product came defective, I could not return questions distances.	-1
I needed a small, cheap, mixer fast, for some solo gigs that were coming up. This fit the bill, and I found it for about $65. I heard all the negative press about Behringer, and went into it figuring it would be disposable.  It didn't disappoint on any of those levels. I got about a year out of it before everything started crackling and sounding over modulated....threw it out. Replaced it with a quality, small board. No hard feelings.	-1
It is nice mixer with 100 effects like reverb etc and it is nice. It is small and compact so it can fit in a small bag. I am still learning how to use it to get the best sound out of it. I don't have any complaints. It is a great buy! **Update** As with all Behringer equipment I found out that 2 of the channels aren't working for some reason had to purchase another one. Sounded great while it lasted though.	-1
Be warned!  It does not say so in the description, but there is no EQ on the four stereo channels.  No solo or mute, buttons either; as well as no power switch (although I expected that from other Behringer small form mixers I've used).  If, like me, you can't see the pictures, you may be surprised by some of these, especially the lack of stereo channel EQ. The description also doesn't mention that the send is post-fader, in case that matters to you.  Also, this seems much more cheaply made than the old version of this mixer (I think it used to be metal!).  In short, Behringer still has some good products (such as the nifty little UCA202), but their really starting to disappoint me with their smaller mixers. Having used the three channel version of this, I know it does not take much to get the nobs to start shorting, and so the lack of a mute button (meaning you must use level to turn off a channel) is a potentially big problem down the road. The use of a proprietary power supply connection format is also a negative in my view--can't replace it with a universal p/s if something goes wrong.  This is definitely not road worthy equipment.  Sending it back and getting one from a different manufacturer (Sampson or Nady).	-1
This unit runs extremely hot - over 110 degrees.  Over time, that's really damaging to electrical components.  The documentation packaged with the unit is extremely scanty.  My attempt to download more product documentation from the manufacturer's website resulted in multiple "page not available" error messages.	-1
Im a pro singer and this has the very worst reverb ive ever had from any equipment.  IF YOU ARE A SINGER, STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!!!!	-1
Considering the price is so cheap on these, I took a chance on this about a year ago for my home hobbyist studio. To say that I used it "rarely" is an understatement - maybe once a month when I have friends over for jamming as a way to get my vDrums and a bass DI through my powered wedges. That said, within a year two of the channels stopped working altogether, and the main volume fader became scratchy and jumpy to the point that the volume all the way down would = the volume ALL the way up.  Aside from it not working less than a year later, as others have mentioned the lack of a power button combined with the wall wart adapter is a bit of a pain as well. However, if you're building a studio on a budget and want to roll the dice, it's a decent little mixer while it works.  Pass on this - sound quality is decent for the price, but reliability gets a zero.	-1
The mixer is good for the price but I had to return my first one soon after opening it due to some loose parts moving around inside. The packing way below average. As a matter of fact, it was the only outer box without any cushioning. After seeing those UPS and FEDEX delivery videos I would not pack a UPS or FEDEX shipping item in such a poor packing. However, the great seller ( I am referring to AMAZON) immediately responded and sent me a replacement along with a prepaid label to return the fist unit. Second unit too had the similar packing but no damages. Worked fine.	-1
Power cord/block is huge. The plug that goes into the mixer is non-standard, and doesn't stay inserted. No on/off switch. All of the above seem to be common complaints with this mixer. I have no idea what they were thinking with this power cord. Why so big and non-standard? After getting this mixer, I paid close attention to choosing its successor, and every other mixer I looked at had a typical barrel connector. This is my first mixer, so I won't comment on its sound or build quality. Sent it back, simply because it kept turning off because the plug barely engaged with the mixer body. Wouldn't even move it, and the plug would fall out.	-1
every basic interface... I returned it, I seems to have a problem with every Behringer product  I have ever bought. Go With the name brand on this one	-1
Produced an awful amount of noise at gain levels just over half. Returned for a similar 8 channel (same brand) and got far less noise. Picked up a USB interface (same brand) that also produced a fair amount of noise. 2 friends of mine swear by these devices and have similar equipment - It's odd but it seems when buying this brand, you have a chance to get a good device or a bad device. Buyer beware!	-1
Too much background noise. Wont buy anything Behringer every again. I have 3 of their products and only the phantom power seems worth anything.	-1
When it worked it worked well. But after about three months it unpredictably cuts in and out. Unfortunately I don't think I can return it at this point either.	-1
The unit itself is well made and does a fine job. HOWEVER, the AC power supply connection in the back makes this little mixer practically useless for any sort of live application. The connector falls out with the slightest of movement. Most other connectors "snap" or "click" in when you insert them. This one however just loosely sits in the socket and falls out routinely.  If this design flaw was addressed properly I could recommend this unit, but not as is.	-1
This didn't serve the purpose I needed it to; previous similar Behringer mixers I had were able to work as a mini-PA of sorts, just to put 1 vocal mic through into a monitor for practice. Well, not this unit. Seems fine but definitely not for much more than mixing a few small things that have plenty of their own power.	-1
very fragile. ust stopped working after a few months. AVOID!!	-1
It's a mixer, it's a Behringer, works for me. Power supply connection is just plain dumb. It's the proprietary Behringer type that looks like an old S-video connection with little pins - that's fine, I've had Behringer mixers before and they've lasted long enough, never had a problem with power connection because it was a snug, secure fit. NOT SO here - you look at it the wrong way and the thing comes loose.  Lame.  Apparently this mixer doesn't supply phantom power. Not an issue as I wouldn't plug anything less robust than a 57 into a budget mixer anyway, but consider that. Also, no rubber feet on the bottom, so it's prone to slide a bit, which wouldn't be a big deal except that little sliding will most likely disconnect the power supply.  My plan (and a possible suggestion) WAS to find a permanent spot where it will live on my desk and attach it with velcro. And probably somehow fix the power cord in place, perhaps with gaffer tape. Then, as I was leaving for work this morning, I randomly checked the power connection again - was I missing something? Is the plug pushed in all the way? I pushed it, it didn't budge - it's in all the way. I release it and I lose power. I nudge it a bit, I get power. On my previous 2 Behringer mixers, the cord would push in about 1/4" and be secure. This one pushes in maybe 1 cm - no exaggeration - and is not secure.  Returning.  Bye, bye, Behringer!	-1
Gain knob for channel 1 is very loose, unlike other knobs. 1/4" inputs are too close together for some cable sizes, which limits what you can plug-in.  Only channel one contains the pre-amp, it does not apply to channels 2/3 and 4/5, even though it says it accepts unbalanced inputs for those channels, they are line-level only.  I do my research before purchasing and this needs to be clearly stated on Amazon. Also, too much noise on the pre-amp for my taste, I was looking for a clean channel boost. I either I got a lemon or expecting too much from this unit.	-1
If all you're doing is putting instruments through it's fine, but WARNING THIS HAS NO PHANTOM POWER. I was on a gig and realized that TOO LATE!	-1
can't adjust it properly.  But sounds ok!  Would not recommend it to anyone. The shipping was great got it in two days and didn't have to pay for faster delivery. Thanks Amazon	-1
This was a gift for a cousin who wanted to just get a signal into his computer for recording. It works just fine for someone starting out, but for someone more experienced, hopefully you'd already have the brains to not buy from Behringer. They're not well known for pro-audio like others such as Sennheiser, PreSonus, Focusrite, etc. They're for beginners.	-1
I tried two different of these mixers (sent one back, and am keeping the other), and both give horrible amounts of extra noise on the Mic in plug, especially when using a Condenser mic that requires Phantom Power.  I have a different Behringer mixer (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Behringer-Xenyx-802-Premium-8-Input-2-Bus-Mixer-with-Xenyx-Mic-Preamps-and-British-EQs/dp/B000J5XS3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Behringer Xenyx 802 Premium 8-Input 2-Bus Mixer with Xenyx Mic Preamps and British EQs</a>) that introduces much less noise than this one (but still not perfect).  Its a soothing white noise in the treble range for those who like it.  All other parts of the mixer works great, line inputs give no noise.  Perfect for mixing together two other pieces of equipment (Guitar, Tape Deck, etc..) but not microphones.  You get what you pay for, so don't expect a silent Mic Pre on this one.	-1
The switch is well made, but it's slightly too wide to fit into the rout on my 2012 American Standard Telecaster, regardless of which direction you mount it to the swtichplate cover. So unless you want to do some woodwork, you might try a different switch. I didn't because the switchplate already barely covers the rout. I bought it to go along with some Bill Lawrence Keystone pups--Bill has a wiring diagram that uses a five-way switch. Guess I'll try a standard Strat switch instead.	-1
This was the highlight of my order and of course it was broken when it arrived. Some of the nugs were bent and the lever was snapped in half. I threw it away and bought one from a guitar store.	-1
Totally unusable sounds-like-a-joke piece of crap. I wish I could give it minus 5 stars. I plead temporary insanity for buying this thing. I was sure I'd never plug it in again after the first 10 seconds of trying it out. Sounds kind of like the sound track on a really really bad sci-fi movie. And to make it worse, it's unfriendly with other pedals, you have to power it on it's own power source, or isolated from all other pedals, I guess because other pedals can't stand the thing either! This thing is a total insult to music!!! I wish it would disappear from the face of the earth! shame shame ehx. Whoever decided to release this thing to the public should lose his job and all of his guitars! On second thought, let him keep his crapiest guitar and a nano clone.	-1
I wanted a simple chorus pedal to use on a song or two with my band.  As a Nirvana fan, the Small Clone was the first thing I was drawn to, and I figured that the Nano Clone must be more or less the same thing in a tiny package, so I found a good deal on one.  This pedal is horrible, and I can't imagine how any musician who cares about their sound would find it acceptable.  It cannot be powered through a daisy-chain with other pedals.  There is a significant volume drop when it is switched on, it introduces a hissing noise, and there is very noticeable bass roll-off.  Underneath all that, yes, it applies a pretty nice chorus effect, but the tradeoff is not worth it.  There are some trimpots inside that can be messed with a bit, but they don't do anything to fix the problems.  I've not played one in person, but I hear that the actual&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Small-Clone/dp/B0002D0C5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Small Clone</a>&nbsp;doesn't share the problems that its defective smaller brother has.  If you really want an EH chorus, go for that.  I picked up a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Danelectro-D-5-Fab-Chorus/dp/B000CCJP4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Danelectro D-5 Fab Chorus</a>, which outperforms this in every possible way except the true bypass.  It's a sad day when Electro-Harmonix's product is completely dominated by a $17 plastic-cased pedal.	-1
For  70 bucks what do you expect, right?  Well, not much.  This amp is one of the most  frustrating amps I've ever worked with.  The amp has a clean channel and a distortion channel but what makes me furious is the fact you always have to toggle the switches yourself to get a true sound out of it.  Say you turn the amp off while it was on clean and then you turn it back on and switch to some crunch or distortion.  You are going to have preset effects attached to the channel.  It's so absurd.  The amp, after many adjustments, can get a  somewhat true clean channel sound but it still has a  slight hint of something being phoned in over the top of it.  Probably one of the many useless  presets it has.  All of the effects sound phoned in on this thing.  Nothing sounds true to pitch.  IT all sounds like your guitar is being plugged into a toy and then filtered with some absurd, cheap affects.  I was pretty upset with it at first but then I thought to myself, it was only 70 bucks and I don't use it for gigs or anything like that so why cry about it.  This amp is probably good for someone who just got into guitar, doesn't know if he wants to stick with it and or someone who wants to toggle in a clean channel manually every time and record with it via PC.  There you can use software to mask the cheapness  that comes from the amp itself.  I've played for  17 years, 8 years of that professionally.  This amp isn't worth much.  To get any kind of "decent" crunch or distortion out of it you have to crank it up so loud all you hear is noise.  Save your 70 bucks and put it towards a decent Vox tube amp or a  Marshal 10inch amp.  Hell, you can buy a decent gigging Marshal amp for about 250 bucks.	-1
I've owned a Line 6 POD 2.0 for a couple of years now.  I was looking for something a little more robust than my Digitech Genesis 1.  The POD came highly recommended, was not inexpensive, and so I figured the unit must be good.  That evening when I plugged it in, I was anticipating an experience somewhat similar to what I'd had using other similar devices by Digitech, Boss, & Zoom.  What I experienced was several hours of disillusionment and frustration.  The device is real easy to plug in and get sound out of, the same as the other devices I'd used.  The problem was the sound I got out of the POD 2.0.  It did not sound good.  The sonic deficiency is difficult qualify, but essentially, the unit sounds flat & unconvincing.  Similar to the effect you get if you wire speakers or guitar pickups out of phase: the sound you get is constantly trying to cancel itself out with only partial success.  You get a hollow sound, and with speakers, you lose most of the definition, including the ability to isolate where the sound is coming from.  With the POD 2.0, I knew where the sound was coming from and I didn't like it.  I chalked up my experience to user error.  Surely the problem lay with me.  I figured the unit is SO capable, that its complex, and since its new to me, I just didn't know how to tweak it into acceptable auditory form.  As loathe as it was, I broke out the manual.  I lined up all the shortcut hint-cards that came with the unit, logged onto the Web, and sat down to learn how to properly use the device.  I spent days reviewing every line in the manual. I read between the lines just in case there was some piece of universal knowledge that somehow wasn't bestowed upon me.  I read forums, and opinions, and lots of other stuff.  I input custom patches created by others.  I tried different guitars, cables, audio amplifiers, speakers, and had other musically-trained ears listen to the output from the POD.  The inescapable conclusion was that the sound the  POD 2.0 produces is crud.  The unit is very solidly constructed.  It comes with quite a manual (though it does take more space on its pages bragging about how wonderful it is than I would like to see in a manual).  The switches and knobs and buttons and lights all work very well.  It sports a gorgeous paint job.  It just doesn't perform its primary duty adequately.  At the risk of sounding like I just hate Line 6, I'll add that the interface ergonomics of the unit, i.e. the way the controls function, the guides painted for the various options, is counter-intuitive.  Sure, after memorizing the manual the device is easy enough to use, but what rock-n-roller has the time (or inclination) to read the manual?  The other devices I have, Digitech Genesis 1, several Zoom multi-effect boxes, Boss & Ibanez effect boxes, Rockman II, and on and on, can all be operated without reading the manual, simply by utilizing the minimum of instruction silk-screened on their cases.  The Digitech is dead simple.  It has a knob, it tells you what the knob does, and has a description painted on the case for each possible setting.  Not the POD.  Both of these issues are inexcusable.  For a company as full of themselves as Line 6 is (as evidenced by the boasting going on in the manual), you'd think they'd actually pay attention to the basics and produce something with a modicum of usefulness.  I didn't return the unit, though I wish I had.  Even after all those days reading and experimenting with the POD, I still figured it was me.  So I kept at it off and on for several more months without even achieving sound as good as I got from my Zoom (straight out of the box with no adjustment).  With the popularity of Line 6's guitars and modeling amplifiers, I've tried episodically to figure out where I'm going wrong configuring the POD 2.0.  I've come to realize where I went wrong was in purchasing the device.	-1
I suppose it's possible that Line 6 could have made a cheaper piece of crap than this pedal, but they would have had to put some real thought into it. Completely plastic build, right down to the input jack. That jack was rather tight and required a bit of force to get the included cable to connect properly. Needless to say, the cable was as cheap a the pedal it came with, and the plug end snapped to the side as I tried to force it in. I then tried the other end of the cable, with the same result.  The motion of the pedal itself, whose plastic inner gear was dripping with some kind of pink gelatinous lubricant, can best be described as "hitchy."  The pedal is short, so that your toes will likely poke over the end by 4-6 inches.  I removed the four rubber feet so that I could velcro the pedal into my pedalboard. With this change, the pedal profile is so low that I could't be sure when I had actually reached "heel down" position.  In use with my DL4 delay unit, the effect is more weird than entirely useful, but that's not this pedal's fault.  $50 doesn't get you much nowadays, if you're a musician.	-1
I bought 3 of these, 2 didn't work.  One failed during a gig!  I had been using M-Audio Uno's before, I thought this tiny design looked cool.  I have replaced my 3 XMIDI's with Uno's and sent the XMIDI's to recycle.	-1
Got the drivers for it on line. Still didn't work. Went with the E-MU. Put that in, updated the driver and it worked	-1
These were faulty, and sent junk signals whenever initially plugged in our used steer clear.	-1
This is a very limited use microphone. I tried a number of different recording types (voice only, voice with music in the background, and instrumental), and the only one that worked with this microphone was a voice only recording. You can't use this for instrumental recordings, music with voice backup, or voice with music backup. I also wouldn't use this for internet radio shows.  Here are more downsides to this microphone. You have to speak directly into the microphone with your face only two or three inches away from it at all times or it won't pick up your voice very well. It is not a multi directional pickup microphone, and it has very limited pickup range. On the worse side, this microphone will pick up all of the background clutter just fine--even with a pop filter. The background clutter just happens to be very soft on the recordings. The microphone is also very heavy, so you will need a microphone stand that won't topple over.  As a band director, orchestral musician, and motivational speaker, I have used many more microphones that are better than this one and less the cost. I would not recommend this microphone unless you are in a recording studio with zero background noise.	-1
I returned mine. This is why:  For $200 you get a basic bass (not bad, but a $110 bass). You also get a bunch of accessories that are really bad: bad cable, junk tuner, useless amplifier, some picks, very light gigbag. I don't think they are $90 worth.  You may feel that for $200 that's a good deal.. but wait, you end-up paying $200 for a basic bass, and accessories that you will have to change immediately ... because really they are no good.  The amplifier has a 6.5 inches speaker (the product description says 8 inches!). And it's not even loud enough for a bedroom! if you increase the volume more than half, you get distortion noise which is awful. It's a useless amplifier.  The bass itself is ok, finish of the frets was not great, some paint issues. Some people will say "You get what you paid for". Well, I've seen instruments from China of this price range with better finish. I think the problem for this bass is quality control.  About sound, well, I don't know, I had only the amplifier with the set so I really can't tell.  I ended-up returning it, I bought a Yamaha RBX170 Metallic Red for $170 and wow, I feel I spent my money more wisely with a better instrument. I'll spend $99 on a decent amp later, like the Ampeg BA 108 25W 8 inches which rocks!  If you want to stick with the bass in this set, I'd suggest you buy just the instrument without the crappy accessories, and you buy a decent amp like the Ampeg. You'll be much, much more happy spending almost the same amount of money. Oh.. and for the tuner, buy a Snark SN-1 Tuner, that's $9 and so much better.	-1

With EMAD the plastic ring dries out and becomes brittle then it is prone to crack esp if it gets nicked. That crack creates an annoying buzz. If you cut to fix then the foam ring can pop out. This has happened the past 3 heads for me so no more. Go Aquarian Super Kick series or REMO PS 3.	-1
This just didn't work for my application which was to use with a native American flute.  Two problems:  1.  the clip is fairly small and only opens about 3/8 of an inch which is too narrow for the top of the flute  2.  the microphone picks up even the slightest vibration of the instrument it is mounted on.  Any tap on the flute body would be heard as a thump via the mount, you could actually hear my fingers thumping on the holes.  It also seemed a little expensive however it did have superb sound and most likely works great in the right application.	-1
This unit came free with my Kamaka ukulele I purchased in Hawaii (a $1,000.00 instrument).  It worked fine for two years and then the seam failed  and leaked, leaving a damaged area of my ukulele.  I would never recommend this device, and I have also let the seller of the instrument (world's largest seller of ukuleles) know how bad it is.  They are going to connect me with the factory to have my  instrument refinished at reduced cost, but there is no excuse for this type of failure. Still a expensive loss to bear.	-1
I've had a few of these in the last few years, and finally after loosing all  quit buying them.  PROS: - doesn't drip - refillable - compact - rubber finish, no scratching  CONS: - quickly get moldy and smelly ..  require antibacterial cleaning - have to be VERY CAREFUL filling them, as the gel balls inside easily spill out - when they dry out, they shrink and get stuck, you have to leave them 1/3 way, let them sit to 'open up' so you can fill them up to the top  Basically, for $20 I can buy 2 of the ones with replaceable sponges and never have to worry about maintenance.	-1
Living in Phoenix I needed a good humidifier for my Taylor guitar. I found the Oasis to be a bit tricky to take in and out. You really have to stretch the strings to slip it in. If you don't it gets caught where the yellow and blue parts connect. I can see how over time the snagging could compromise the seams or construction. Also, it only got up to 35% humidity. I put a sponge based one into the guitar and was getting more like 43% humidity and that one was $11.	-1
$20 for maybe a year? from my own experience. I have several of these laying around all of them leak badly and all of them are less than one-year-old. For anyone who says they don't s*** I'll sell you mine half-price. These are pure garbage for 20 bucks!	-1
My OH-1 had a slow seam leak.  The "gel" CAN leak, despite product literature claims.  Especially through defective seams.  A $7,000 Kenny Hill Signature classical guitar was destroyed.  Back seam split.  Braces swollen and popped off.  Neck joint unglued.  Oasis responded by informing me there is no warranty against this product leaking, and they have no liability.  Note:  the SEAMS were defective.  The product was defective, and yet they feel NO obligation.  DO NOT TRUST YOUR INSTRUMENTS to this company's products.  Caveat emptor.	-1
I used this last year, and followed all the instructions for handling. This winter, the crystals won't absorb moisture.  I see that they sell replacement crystals.  For the price, I think this was a rip.	-1
I've had a DigiTech Jam Man Stereo looper for a couple of years now, and really like it.  I gave it four stars in a review here:  http://www.amazon.com/review/RTY7SNGAPFFXR/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm and with a few minor tweaks it would have rated five stars.  Not so the accessory footswitch for the device.  The FS3X purports to work with the Jam Man Stereo, to allow footswitch control over functions that would otherwise have to be accessed by bending over and tweaking knobs or buttons on the unit.  And it does do that... sort of.  The switch unit itself is well-made and solid-feeling, with a metal case, heavy-duty momentary-contact buttons that are nearly silent in operation, and enough "heft" to it to not slide around when you stomp on it.  The cable that connects the footswitch to the Jam Man uses simple 1/4" TRS stereo phone plugs.  It plugs in at both ends, which is handy for when the cable wears out -- as they always do -- you can just replace it by plugging in a new cable; no disassembly or soldering required.  The real down side (for me, anyway) is what the buttons control, and the non-intuitive way they are labeled. The three buttons are labeled "Mode", "Down", and "Up".  * Now there is a "mode" selector on the Jam Man, for choosing the recording mode; it would have been handy if the "Mode" button on the FS3X controlled this; it doesn't.  * "Up" and "Down" could most reasonably be expected to apply to either tempo control (up = faster; down=slower), or to loop selection (to step either up or down in loop number.  These buttons don't really do either of these things.  * The Jam Man manual says that the FS3X facilitates "loop selection"; it doesn't.  So just what -do- these three buttons do?  Well...  - The "Mode" button does an erase and reset of a loop in progress.  But you can already do this from the main Jam Man, by holding one of the existing foot-buttons down for a second or two.  - The "Down" button kicks playback into and out of "Reverse" mode.  Say what?  - The "Up" button does actually control tempo, but only in one direction:  it speeds up the loop during playback, until you reach the maximum available playback speed, then it drops back to the lowest available speed and starts over.  If you need to pick up the tempo a little during playback, this is useful.  If you need to -slow down- the tempo during playback . . . not so much.  One has to wonder what they were thinking when they assigned functions to this switch?  Having a switch labeled "mode" has nothing to do with the actual "mode function" of the device is not only counterintuitive, but the actual function needlessly duplicates one already available from a footswitch on the main box. Having "Up" and "Down" switches that not only don't correspond to the only parameters it would make any sense to move "up" or "down" is bad enough, but neither do these two switches have any functional relationship to /each other/, as, I think, almost any English-speaking user would assume they did. Finally, since I never use the "reverse" feature, adding a footswitch to activate this feature is pretty much a waste for me no matter how you look at it.  Why didn't DigiTech make the functions of these outboard switches user-assignable, or assign them to more useful functions?  At the very least, why didn't the LABEL the switches to reflect what they actually DO control (e.g.:  "Erase/Reverse/Tempo", instead of "Mode/Down/Up")??  I can only speculate, but it seems as if this footswitch was originally designed for some product -other than the Jam Man Stereo-, and labeled accordingly.  And DigiTech may have had a bunch of these laying around.  So, rather than design a new footswitch for the Jam Man Stereo, they just started marketing the existing switch for the new device.  Too bad, because they have a good product in the Jam Man unit itself, and this kind of shoddy attention to detail annoys customers to no good purpose.  Bottom Line:  If this switch had cost $8-$10, none of this would bother me too much, but it sells for $35.  Not expensive enough to make it worth my while to ship it back, but just enough to make me feel like I wasted my money on it.  Buy the Jam Man Stereo; give the FS3X footswitch a pass by.	-1
I wanted a compressor primarily for bass to take the edge off the occasional excessive transient and smoothen up the tone. Well you shouldn't expect magic from a compressor, of course, but I was pretty underwhelmed by this one. The effect is very subtle (or nonexistent), then as you turn it up it suddenly kicks in with a rather unpleasant effect. To my ears it works better on guitar, but again I find the compression extremely abrupt when it kicks in and very audible, not in a good way. I was much more pleased with my TC Electronics rack compressor which I put in the effects loop of my bass amp. That has a much more subtle effect + you get a noise gate as well (and two channels too!) and a lot more versatility for pretty much the same price.	-1
If you are just starting with a small bedroom studio and don't want to throw away much money on equipment, this might be the preamp for you. It's inexpensive. If you decide to buy it, keep in mind that the stock Chinese tube sounds kind of shrill when cranked up, and will most likely have to be replaced by a better quality brand name tube, which is fortunately both inexpensive and relatively easy (you only need a screwdriver and no more than 10 minutes).  Now the bad news. I've had tho of these for a few years. They are unreliable and not well built. While they do add some tube warmth to your signal, they are not the best sounding. The top end is kind of muted, and the Tube MP adds undesirable low end rumble to your sound. They don't have the headroom of a pro tube preamp - instead of opening up the signal, the Tube MP kind of shrinks it.  Bottom line: a decent first mic pre for beginners, but if you've been recording for a while and are looking for quality, this is not your mic pre.	-1
Maybe I got a bad one, but it did not do very well in my setup. I tried it on my pedal board and isolated, as well as with the provided power supply, 1spot and battery.  To start, I'm not a fan of the fact that it's huge. A clean boost has a relatively small circuit, and should not take up as much space as my TC Electronic Noa Delay.  It also added tons of nasty noise. Not what I would call clean gain at all. The vol pot sizzled and crackled when it was turned, and the bypass switch produced a VERY loud/nasty popping noise, quite bad compared to all other pedals I own.  It does seem to feel like it's great quality, unfortunately once plugged in it just didn't work out for me. Again, maybe mine was defective, but my opinion if it has been tainted, and wouldn't own another one.  This got returned.	-1
Does not work with senheiser wireless lavilier systems! No doubt it is wired slightly different then what I needed for my application. However I was unable to output ANY audio to my mixer when using this product...mono nor stereo output worked. Returned for a full refund! Look elsewhere	-1
Total crap.  Bought this to use with my PA system for doing wedding receptions and such, TONS of crackle,distortion, and outright signal loss, I threw it away after trying it the first time.  Luckily I had a backup plan with some adapters or else I would have been scrambling to the nearest Radio Shack and had an angry bride on my hands. I have bought other Hosa cables that were okay but this one was awful.	-1
My band needed a simple 1/8" to XRL cable to connect an iPod to our mixer to play music during breaks....pretty simple, right? This cable isn't the solution.  Not only does the poorly thought-out 90 degree angle 1/8" end get in the way, but does not allow for use with any kind of iPod / iPad case. These design flaws aside, the cable died after a couple weeks....avoid	-1
I bought this product to get the output of my iPad2 to my PA system for live music.  I have sound processing apps on the iPad that I use and was looking for a balanced cable to handle this task.  This cable is horrendously noisy and completely unusable.  It is costing me more in shipping to return it, so it will be going into the trash.  Save your money.	-1
Bought this for a RODE quality mic and from the day I got it, it just wouldn't fit tight into the mic handle. I had to use black electrical tape to hold it. It falls apart after some use, don't waste your money on this one.  Finally bought a quality replacement and the fit was tight and the build much better then this one.	-1
I have owned this a little over a month and it stopped working and I repaired it and now it is not working again. I made my own cable and I would reccomend not wasting your money on this cord!!	-1
I bought these because I needed something to go from a 3.5 mm TRS (tip-ring-sleeve) connector to XLM male - so far, so good. However, in my particular application, the 3.5 mm jacks that I am using (and with which these will ultimately mate) carry a balanced signal, as do MOST TRS connectors. Labeling a connector "TRS" implies that it is meant for a balanced signle-channel signal. Granted, normally, 3.5 mm-style connectors are used to carry two-channel unbalanced signals (i.e. 'stereo' signals), and my use of the 3.5 mm jacks with which these are to mate is a bit unconventional, but in my particular application, I used 3.5 mm TRS jacks to carry balanced audio signals due to space constraints in the installation.  Enough of that...back to "the item'.  So... in a TRS connector, the tip (T) carries the V(+), the ring (R) carries the V(-), and the sleeve (S) is the gound to which both channels are referenced; this is the reason that it is known as a balanced signal, because the signals on pins 2 and three are the same as one another, but 180 degrees out of phase. HOWEVER, these connectors, while they do indeed have three conductors coming from the 3.5 mm TRS connector, do NOT mate 1:1 with the same pins on the XLR male. That is, if it were wired 1:1 the tip (T) of the 3.5 mm would be tied to pin 2 of the XLR, the ring (R) of the 3.5 mm would be tied to pin 3 of the XLR, and the sleeve (S) of the 3.5 mm connector would be tied to pin 1 of the XLR. The cable is wired with the signal from the tip (T) and the signal from the ring (R) mating to pin 2 on the XLR; the sleeve (S) part of the 3.5 mm TRS mates with pins 1 AND 3 of the XLR.  So, if you are expecting to use this as a connector to adapt a signal obtained from a 3.5 mm TRS connector to a XLR connection you will not get a balanced signal out of the XLR - it's not physically (electrically) possible.  I think this product is really mis-labeled, because this is clearly designed to take a two-channel unbalanced signal from something like an mp3 player and (kinda-sorta-mostly-in-a-way-but-not-really) yield a signal that is compatible with an XLR female input; normally, and almost universally, an XLR female implies that a balanced (not a single-ended) signal will be fed to that input. These should really be labeled as 'stereo 3.5 mm to XLR male' as that would be more accurate.  Still, to simply tie the left and right channel outputs of an mp3 player together (or ANY output for that matter) is really a bad idea, because you are effectively shorting the left and right channels together in an attempt to sum them to a single-channel signal - if the XLR connector barrel had some reasonably-valued dropping resistors connected to pin 2 and to pin 3, and then the other side of those resistors connected to the tip and ring signals, then you would have a summer (a simple mixer), but that's not what's been done here.  Mind you, this can all be remedied with some small wire-cutters, a soldering iron, and some time. Frankly, I bought these thinking that they really were TRUE TRS to XLR (1:1) and this was a bit cheaper than I could make them; I would not have to spend my time building them myself. As it is, it's a bigger hassle to send them back for a refund / exchange, so I will simply modify them to make them a true 1:1 3,5 mm TRS to XLR connector. That is, I will re-solder the XLR connectors such that:  (This is how they SHOULD be wired):  XLR pin 1 = SHIELD TRS XLR pin 2 = TIP TRS XLR pin 3 = RING TRS  Again, just to clarify, this (described below) is how these ARE wired (and shipped) by HOSA - and this is NOT the correct way to wire this:  XLR pin 1 = SHIELD TRS XLR pin 2 = TIP TRS, RING TRS XLR pin 3 = SHIELD TRS (and therefore, pin 1 XLR = pin 3 XLR).  Clear as mud?	-1
Didn't work for me.  My $15 pickup works much better.	-1
Barcus Berry does make good violin pickups, but it's not this model. The sound is just too harsh, no matter what preamp or Amplifier I played it through. If I play the violin acoustically, I have to remove it from the bridge as it acts like a mute. I would not recommend this to a friend.	-1
These were great until they recently began using a material on the rings that flakes off after just a few hits.  Junk now.	-1
The amp is "ok"... but I'm not that happy with it.  It should have more options for input, perhaps a 1/8" input, or RCA or dual quarter-inch.. it's an odd input format when considering being used in a studio situation.  In any case, it's also very noisy.  I ended up not using it for the application I bought it for.	-1
Noisy. Just noisy.	-1
Tried to use this for practicing boosting tracks and playing with them, but the boost is nonexistent. All it does is allow the same volume to more people.for that, its great I guess.	-1
Sound quality was diminished, quality is poor and the power is weak. I do not recommend.	-1
The unit is sold as accepting a TRS STEREO input and producing a set of 4 STEREO outputs. The unit I received takes the STEREO TRS input, converts it to mono on one side only and then puts the signal out on one side of the output. If I slide the input connector, I can get it rough MONO on both sides of the output, but that is not what it said it did.	-1
Typical Behringer quality. Adds noise and hardly any gain. Why do I keep falling for Behringer?	-1

returned this cause it did not work properly.  did not replace it.  I ordered a different one.  BUT- if it did work, it is a nice looking unit build very well.	-1
Great until it stopped functioning properly after about 6 months of pretty light use.	-1
It came with a UK or Egyptian or Peruvian type power supply and has to be returned.  I mean, it said nothing about a non-american style electrical plug.  Pretty useless.	-1
Bought to use for a podcast, I couldn't get a useable level plugging the mics into it via 1/8 jack. Bad sounds, bought a cheap mixer and it worked TONS better. I would recommend looking at other products, I ended up going with a Alto Professional ZMX52 but you can decide what works for you.	-1
This thing doesn't work good. I could only hear sound from the left headphone. At first I thought it was my headphones but I tried different kinds and I realized it was this cheap cue amp. Forget it, don't waste your time	-1
This unit hums sooooo much, it's too stressful to use, I cannot recommend. Once you pluck a string there is a ocean of white noise following the tone. I just had to put it aside, now it is just a waste of money.	-1
This item has a European plug.  I'm particularly irked because I noted this in feedback from other customers and checked with the seller.  He informed me that all mixers sold in the US had US plugs.  I ordered based on this info.  I feel duped.  Now I need to purchase a plug adapter.  Not cool....	-1
You get what you pay for.  This is a cheap headphone amp for a cheap price.  There's a lot of noise but it will make your signal louder,.	-1
I'd give this 1 and a half stars if I could. This little Amp is so noisy if you hardly touch/move a cable plugged into it. It is so hard to get full sound in head/earphones with this. I can only hear in one ear in every headphone/output, and hardly anything in the other. I have to always adjust my cable's connector to get any full sound for a second. I can still use this, but hardly. I really don't like this.	-1
The power adapter that shipped with this unit does not work in a standard U.S. outlet! I would have purchased another product had I known this.	-1
I got this to help with a simple home recording studio setup, however there was a noticeable drop in audio quality when using it. High frequency sounds were muffled and the bass was slightly boosted, basically making everything sound muddy.  If you don't care about differences in audio quality, the device itself seems well built and otherwise works as designed.	-1
I purchased three of these. This product actually does not do what it advertised to do - carrying the audio signal.  The 1/4" side gets stuck in the middle of removal. The 1/8" side does not to make proper contact.  It looks very similar to Radioshack ones at a much lower price. Caveat: Radioshack ones work and this one does not.	-1
I'm getting an intermittent connection with this adapter. I have tried it in different devices and with different cables and it always takes spinning and wiggling to make it work right.  Then at times, I'll lose one side and have to start over to make it work again. With headphones this is annoying, because you can reach over to fix it, but with other connections that aren't so easy to reach, it could really be a problem.	-1
I used this once and as I took it out of the jack it fell apart into 3 pieces. I managed to put the pieces back together, and it fell apart again. I see several other people have had the same experience. An item like this is not worth the time and effort to return.	-1
I bought this to use with amplified harmonica. It does stop some of the feedback, but mutes the tone a lot in the process. I did not like the sound. I sent it back for a refund. My Kinder AntiFeedback Plus is more expensive, but WAY better.	-1
Cheap Boss 7 EQ clone. Sliders are meagers. Sound quality is passable. I intended to use it as a boost. A little noisy.  I would recommend the Danelectro Fish and Chips which is by far superior at only a slightly higher cost.  If this broke, I'd definitely use it for target practice.	-1
Introduced a serious buzzing noise when on.  Liked the ergonomics and extended range of it, tho.  Plastic case was a minus, but seemed serviceable.	-1
If you're just hanging out at home or jamming casually this works just fine.  It is far too noisy to gig with.  It's fairly common with Behringer pedals, they do what they are supposed to at a really good price but they are made of really cheap parts and add an unfortunate amount of noise to the signal path.  The other issue I have with it is the frequencies you can control.  Half of the frequencies are FAR higher than what is useful for a guitar player!!  You can just cut the top one completely off.  It is up there with the noise old TVs used to make.  The next two are above any actual guitar tone, but I guess they affect upper harmonics some.  Once you're in the middle of the controls you have a couple of bands that you can work with then it goes to sub-bass.  If it were tuned to control actual guitar frequencies it would be WAY more useful than it is.  If you're a purist you probably shouldn't bother with this.  It's functional enough to use on occasion, but just barely.	-1
EQ is not great on this. The set frequencies for each fader does not make a big difference in sound. Sounds gets uglier most of the time to be honest.	-1
Mid to upper frequencies didn't even change while adjusting. Only the bottom 2 or 3.	-1
It's plastic. Battery is VERY hard to access. The sound just didn't do it for me. I returned it. Fast shipping and easy return, though.	-1
Works well to take care of noise and some of the boomy frequencies in our church. Although, it is easy to forget to turn it on when getting everything set up, I'd prefer if it would always turn on when plugged in with a stomp to turn it off.  EDIT: I stopped using for a while after we got a new sound system with a better equalizer, but then got the pedal out again just the other day and found that the thing was dead. New battery didn't work. New power cord that I just bought didn't work. No lights, nothing. Changing my 4-star to only 1-star rating because something like this ought to last longer, especially if it's not even being used.	-1
Arrived on time dead. Installed 9 volt battery and no led activity at all. Wondering if there is any quality control on this unit? Power adapter is a separate purchase. Plastic housing. Ordered replacement unit and purchased Power adapter. Didn't save the original box and paid 2.75 at UPS store for another box to ship defective unit back. Cheesy method to get to battery compartment. Boss equalizers are easier to get to battery compartment. Hoping the replacement unit will be functional. Extremely disappointed. Amazom is replacing unit no charge including return shipping. Just had to buy another box since I didn't keep original box intact.	-1
i have used behringer products in the past. They make nice, inexpensive mixers. had high hopes this bass equalizer would be a bargain, but it fell way below expectations.  It made my Rickenbacker bass muddy and muffly. It actually sounded better just going direct into my mixer, for recording. Gonna try the more expensive MXR 10 band. I used the MXR years ago and it added definition and a slight boost that made my bass stand out. Now the Behringer may work in live performance, it did not work in my music room.	-1
I can't really speak to how well it works as an equalizer, because I rejected it because of the extra noise it introduced.  It seemed to be reasonably well made and I was disappointed that it wasn't usuable.	-1
5 stars to the seller for the professional an fast delivery, packageing an cost!!!! but shame on the behringer co. for even putting this pos out on the market, all plastic pedal that sound dual an barely adds any tone to your setup. WEAK	-1
Poor quality. The sliders don't appear to do anything to the sound.	-1
I bought this to level off my vocals/guitars while recording in my home studio... It does do that, but comes with lots of extra noise and is soo sensitive when tweeking... finally, i just turn the level down and adjust as i like and filter the noise out later... I would never buy again or recommend, but i'm on a budget, so i am still using it... 2 stars for the fact that i can actually still use it	-1
if you go very high with the boost in frequencies, you will get noise in significant quantities. too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation. Pay the extra money and get something quiet. Others complained about this and they were right. If you want to experiment with equalization, its good and cheap. Some complained about each band boosting others. This is more of a user problem than manufacturing. If you want to isolate a frequency range, boost that range and then cut the ones before and after it and you'll get a narrow range. In this respect, its like an MXR 6 band.	-1
Behringer pedals are really cheaply made and the feel amazingly light, cheap and unable to take the riggors of gigging. I just didn't want to spend $100 on the Boss version, but you get what you pay for! Another thing that I hate is it's really hard to change the battery, unlike the Boss pedals. save your money and steer clear of this one. I also bought a Behringer power amp for $200 that lasted a few gigs befor it crapped out.	-1
when open the box and you see this piece of plastic and cheap made product the only thing that you have in mind is in resale or put in some place away from your sight... i don`t recomend this pedal even the others ones made for behringer even when the cost is no expensive but you could and would see the DANO`s before buy this things. i don`t recommend at all this things.	-1
If you move any EQ slider off of "zero", either up or down, this unit produces a very obvious hiss; making it unuseable.  It gets worse the farther you move off any "zero" setting.  The Berhinger EQ700 is a very disappointing product.  This is not a negative review of the seller; just the product.	-1
Considering the price, I wish I could say it is excellent but it is not.  Not terrible but just does not produce what my ears is seeking.  I had a MXR phaser and got used to it because it is incredibly effective. But then I decided to drop my pedal board and go rack mount instead.  Didn't like that so had to start pedal activity again.  Unfortunately, I had sold the MXR Phaser.  I didn't want to buy a new one so went cheaper.  The vintage phaser is not bad but it does not produce the inline results I like.  I play COB and EVH and it just seems to not play well with my guitar and JVM amp.  I have it for sale now, cheap (of course) and would recommend that anyone wanting to use pedals should just get the top pedal you want for the sound.  MXR Phaser, Boss Super Chorus cannot be replaced, in my opinion.  Though I will say Blackstar tube pedals are exceptional but far too expensive.	-1
Horrible, noisy, distorted, and tone sucking, but at least it worked for 15 minutes.  Behringer stuff is a waste of money.  You'd think I would have learned by now.	-1
This pedal quit working after a couple of months wouldn't recommend	-1
Crap.  Worked about 50% of the time when brand new.  Ended up in the trash.	-1
It's a decent unit, but stopped working completely after about 6 months. Tried everything I could, but it's gone. I would not recommend this pedal.	-1
Garbage	-1
VERY disappointed in very low gain and poor tone. Not even close to approximating a Tube Screamer. Like all Behringer pedals, it's annoying that input cables must be pulled to save batteries.	-1
You need a 9v power supply (sold separately) but it takes a 9v battery. Guess what I didn't have? You basically take the entire thing apart (there are NO directions) to replace the battery. Nonetheless not hard to figure out, just impossible0 in execution. You must compress a spring from two sides holding the "pedal" to the top. If you manage it, prepare for one or more flying springs or parts when you remove the top. Did I say wear eye protection?  Moving on... Now you can see the engineering genius. See the tiny chintzy switch on which the blob of rubber comes down to switch it.... maybe.... and you go "WTF?? Who thought this was a good idea?" You'll realize you only have about a 50-50 chance of it going back together as "designed."  I winged it with a cut-down spring and a coat hanger.  Works ok now.  Adds noise to the signal, however.	-1
When you pivot your foot back, the effect is automatically shut off. This is a horrible feature. How are you supposed to use the expression pedal for wah-wah sounds if when you pivot back, it shuts off!?	-1
AMAZON WHOLESALE WHAREHOUSE "Discounted?  TERRIBLE, whoever did the Quality control should be re evaluated. This Pedal was defunct on numerous levels. OUT to AMP loose connector onside. Right button switch had insane static and was unable to subdue. turning it to the LEFT "off" was even worse. So this one should have never been send out. The Pedal otherwise seems to be pretty useful.	-1
Range is quite limited.  Doesn't cut in until halfway down.  Doesn't even come close to an original late 60's Wah Sound.  Wouldn't buy it again!	-1
I bought this pedal and the Behringer power supply for it.  Within five minutes I noticed one of my pickups making a hissing and crackling noise.  I actually had to re-solder the pickup on to fix the problem.  Still don't know what happened but all I can come up with is it sent a reverse charge in to my guitar and charged a capacitor in the guitar.  Anyway it scared the heck out of me and I'm returning the pedal.  The sound wasn't too bad...except when the pedal was turned off.  The bypass is terrible and sucked an insane amount of tone.  Seriously...I'm not talking a little bit of tone difference.  With the pedal in my loop and out of the loop the difference was huge.  Test it yourself if you get one.  Hit some hard clear notes with the pedal turned off and hooked up.  And then take it out of your loop and hit the same notes.  You WILL hear the difference.  I'm not a cheap pedal or guitar snob either.  Skip this one....get a different cheaper pedal clone of a tube screamer with true bypass.	-1
Just received the 2nd one, the first one didn't work. This one doesn't either...sad...	-1

...but this Wah is just horrible. I bought it many years ago when I didn't have the same budget as I have now. I used it two times. It can't even be called a wah... Since then I played Vox, Morley, Dunlop... They are all different and everyone has his preferences but they are all 'real' wah pedals. You can find good second hand wah pedals for about 20$ more. It is worth it, trust me.  I put two stars because I tried to plug it and it is still working after all those years. That was the only time this pedal surprised me.	-1
not suitable for bass, no matter what anyone says. Drains batteries almost immediately. Use with a adapter. I modified mine to get more sweep..if anything, take off the rubber pads so the pedal has more travel. There are mod videos online.	-1
Ok.  I buy a lot of musical equipment.  I saw this Behringer while looking to buy a new Crybaby.  My old Crybaby finally quit after 28 years of steady use.  The price was attractive, and I decided to go for it.  When it arrived, I unpacked it, plugged it in and started up some recorded tracks to work on.  This is the worst piece of equipment that I can remember ever spending money on.  The wah absolutely sucks.  I can't think of any use for this pedal, AT ALL.  It's that bad.  If you're considering purchasing this , to get a good vintage 60's and 70's wah sound, forget it.  Go ahead and spend the extra money for a Crybaby.  You'll be glad you did.	-1
NO INDEPENDENT ON/OFF SWITCH! If the pedal didn't effect the signal while at idle (every wah does to some extent ) and if there was no lag both in/out (off/on) then this pedal would be a winner given it's price point. IMO what looked good on some designer's drawing board doesn't cut it in the real world, at least the one I live in. The pedal has decent sweep and tone. Durability won't be an issue because it won't get used much.	-1
Bought this because of all the great reviews, But This doesn't work, just like the last Beringer product I bought. Will I ever learn? Very disappointing.  UPDATE- Now working; got my mate an Aussie genius to have a look. Found pedal wasn't engaging when pushed down. Took plastic cover off and pressed black button with his pinky and light came on; sheer genius. Worked fine with cover off; then replaced cover with new bit of rubber. And it still works. Amazing sound actually Still not sold on Berhinger though	-1
The metallic coating damaged. The manufacturer should have inspected it beforehand.	-1
JUNK...don't waste your $$$	-1
Terrible.  Made my acoustic sound worse... no preamp gain at all... I perform nightly at the top hotels and resorts in Florida, The Ritz, JW Marriott, Disney, etc.  My sound is of the utmost importance. (I play acoustic and play piano and sing)  I formerly performed in Las Vegas 6 nights a week at the Venetian | Palazzo where I used a Boss AD3 Acoustic Guitar Multi Effects Pedal.  It finally crapped out on me and when I moved back to Florida and I waited a while to replace it with something new. So I purchased the BEHRINGER V-TONE ADI21.  Sorry to say, no comparison... well, they serve different purposes... but in any case, the V-Tone made my awesome sounding Simon & Patrick acoustic electric sound WORSE. It happens to sound great on its own, I was just looking for some preamp boost along with finer tone control, but alas, any adjustment I made on this unit made it sound worse.  I also own a recording studio (a real one) and sound is something that matters to me.  So unfortunately, having purchased this unit based on the stellar reviews, I will be returning it for a refund on Monday.	-1
didn't make much of a difference...and it added more noise to the mix.....pass on it	-1
BOTH my friend and I bought this DI because we needed a backup and had been very happy with Behringer products.  I got mine and immediately HATED the sound.  I know it's subjective, but I had a pro friend listen and we both agreed it completely muddied and distorted the sound and the EQs weren't responding the way they were supposed to.  We both said the guitars sounded better bypassing the Behringer.  I returned it to Amazon and made them pay shipping figuring it was a fluke.  ANOTHER friend bought one and had the exact same experience with it.  SO.  This has clearly gotten a lot of good reviews, so if yours sounds like crap SEND IT BACK and order another to see if maybe it was a fluke.  But honestly if you gig in ANY live settings bite the bullet and just get a better DI.  These two are the ones I recommend....  Dean Markley Plus DI - http://www.amazon.com/Dean-Markley-DI-PLUS-Amplifier/dp/B0002J157G  LR Baggs Para Acoustic DI (I would argue the best on the market for the money) - http://www.amazon.com/LR-Baggs-Para-Acoustic-D-I/dp/B001E95KEC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1449339383&sr=8-1&keywords=baggs+para+di	-1
Used twice.... put it away and the next time I used it.... it didn't work... at all. Bummer.... sounded good while it worked.	-1
Well, I guess you shouldn't really expect a whole bunch, especially when you're paying less than $30 for an effects pedal. I received this as a birthday present when I was 15, so I suppose I don't have to worry about any of my money being wasted. But if you're really serious about music and on a budget, I suggest saving up, waiting, and getting a better distortion pedal, such as the ones this pedal tries to emulate (BOSS DS-1, MXR D+, ProCo RAT).  Pros: -Super cheap -Emulates three different pedals for a variety of sound to choose from.  Cons: -The emulations themselves are poor. The DS-1 emulation is shrill, irritating, noisy, and makes your tone extremely thin. The D+ emulation falls short of the original pedal in terms of tone and clarity, and finally, the RAT emulation has nowhere near the same, deep grumble and growl of the original pedal. -The pedal is not good bypass. At first I didn't notice it, but when I finally purchased a better amplifier and started playing at louder volumes, I was able to notice that the "clean" setting still has slight bits of distortion. Even though the switch is in the off position, the distortion doesn't completely turn off. This is bad because you need to have access to your clean tones during the middle of a performance or recording. This is why pedals turn on and off. Regardless of your opinion of the sound or quality of the actual distortion, this fact alone is enough reason not to buy this pedal. -The pedal itself is constructed of plastic, so it feels cheap in your hand compared to the nice metal build of most other guitar effects pedals. -The power input is located on the side of the pedal, right next to the input jack. This is literally one of the most inconvenient locations to place the power input, especially when your power supply is a daisy chain and you're connecting multiple pedals. -Unlike other pedals which conveniently have a clip-on cover (Ibanez Tube Screamer, for example) or an easily turnable screw (Boss pedals), you have to have two finely pointed objects (I used pens) to push in two separate buttons on each side to open the battery compartment of this pedal. Literally, you cannot open it with just your fingers. This is a huge inconvenience if you are needing to change the batteries quickly.  Overall, I would not at all recommend this pedal to anybody, especially when one of the pedals it attempts to emulate, the Boss DS-1, is a thousand times better quality and only about twenty to thirty dollars more expensive at $45. I literally cannot think of any decent reason for you to purchase this pedal, either for yourself or for a friend of yours who enjoys music. Save up the money and get something that is worth your time and will actually serve you in the long run. 1/5.	-1
yeah this is great if you want a cheap ass pedal with no sound improvement. Awful awful awful save some money up and buy something that doesn't suck, do your band a favor.	-1
sounded great until it died the third time I used it. 5 weeks later and still waiting for the replacement.  would not rely on it.	-1
On the one i was sent i can play only one guitar threw one amp at a time. I cant play two guitars threw one amp or one guitar threw two amps. The wording in the description is tricky and mislead me it is not worth what i paid for it. It adds some noise to the signal also. I am not happy with this pedal at all.	-1
I purchased the PB100 for my own use, hoping to enhance my sound.  It came with no power supply or manual.  It worked great for about 2 weeks.  Then it just quit.  Behringer support is difficult in the least, like trying to drive through a obstacle course in a snow storm.  I do not recommend this product.  If you purchase it, you might get lucky, but I didn't and I don't even know what to do with the thing now except throw it in the trash.  Wasted money.	-1
Battery that came with it was rotten and unusable.  My ball rotates about 10 seconds before the motor stops.  If this was a more expensive product it would have been immediately returned	-1
looks very nice when get it but after a couple uses start loosing the little mirror squares, they are attached to the ball with a very low quality glue,not recomend to buy it.	-1
Absolute garbage. Completely kills the tone. I would suggest a better quality unit like the Lehle P-Split II  I tried to call and email Behringer about the issue, but never got a response.	-1
It is suppose to sound like a tube amp. I like the actual Tube Ultra Gain Mic 200, with a new tube, this sounds nothing like a tube amp. A few of the settings are workable and I do like the high pass sweep. Just use it for recording into an iPhone.	-1
We had an old Behringer 1202 mixer with only unbalanced 1/4" outputs  connected to a pair of newer Behringer 10" powered speakers, and there was a pronounced hum - a surprise, gear of the same brand not compatible? So we bought the hum destroyer - same brand - and it made the hum worse. The old mixer was pretty noisy anyway no matter how the signal chain was arranged, so we retired it and bought a Soundcraft with balanced XLR outputs. (The speaker upgrade has to wait.)	-1
Only added it's own noise to the circuit, blocked out apx. 60% of the audible input from a guitar. With a 16watt studio amp, the sound was so severely cut as to make the guitar inaudible.  t may  be defective; I can't say it did nothing, because it did- all BAD.Better not have it. I own 7 Behringer pedal effects, no problem.	-1
I tried different Guitars, Amps and Basses. KILLED the signal...and sucked out all the tone. Massive High end and gain loss.	-1
I returned this as it didn't work well and was not transparent. Its presence in the signal chain impacted my tone.	-1
it takes to hums and buzz but it also takes away the overall gain	-1
Didn't do very much at all for me.  It might help someone with 60hz hum (I doubt it though) which wasn't my issue.	-1
When it comes to a hum in audio equipment, there could be so many causes.  This item might have worked just fine, but it didn't stop the hum I was getting which could be coming from anywhere.  Still trouble shooting for the cause.	-1
this device seems to create hum rather than eliminate it. With Behringer products, its hit or miss. If they work, they are great value - but this is one that doesn't do its job.	-1
Very unsatisfied with this.  I decided to pay more for a DI thinking it would be higher quality than ones half its price.  I was wrong.  I continue to get fooled by Behringer products.  They seem to have good specs and pricing, but ultimately the cheap build quality raises its ugly head.  I just did a session with a brand new unit and it was extremely noisy.  I ended up switching to a Pyle Pro DI and that worked much better.	-1
Bought 4 of them. 1 never did work, the other 3 have all stopped working or have a loud buzz. Spend a little more money and get a good one.	-1
Way  too quiet. Used it between an Ibanez bass with active elecs and a JBL PA (The plastic one portable one that most people use now), barely could hear anything. Tried an audio player on full volume out through it as well, same result. It does work, but not usable, at least for me.	-1
Haven't had much luck with this box, granted, we have it as a backup, but every time I've used this, it hasn't sent a clear channel. I've always gave up on it quickly and grabbed another DI box.	-1
Bought this behringer headphone amplifier to give my headphones a little more boost .. received my package on delivery time but did not perform anything as described in the detailed description. . I would return it if i had that option. .. don't waste ur money	-1
low signal	-1
signal is very weak.	-1
Peace of junk, simple as that.	-1
I bought two of these for use as headphone amps for IEM's in a practice room. The output is ridiculously weak and they were completely unusable. Thankful for Amazon's excellent return policy!	-1
I tried using this with a Casio Privia PX-5S, but it didn't really do it for me.  Probably going to return it and go for a different one.  I'm probably using it wrong, but if I can't hear myself, then it is what it is.	-1
If you use phantom power, it will cause a loud hum, unless you use a hum eliminator between the stereo mix and the Micromon. Also, there wasn't really any mic amplification when I was using a dynamic mic with no phantom power. Then when I went to a condenser with phantom, I got a hum and still no amplification on the mic. But when I put a hum eliminator between the Micromon and the stereo mix, then removed and then reinserted the power to the Micromon, suddenly I was getting good amplification from the mic. So I think this model is a bit flaky, but I might be able to work with it, now that I've got the hum eliminator there. But don't even think of buying this for use with a condenser mic unless you have a hum eliminator (I used a Morley).	-1
This was my 2nd one because it's a convenient way to run sound from my PC to my stereo receiver but there's a high pitched frequency that constantly bleeds with this thing and I definitely won't be buying another. At first, I thought it was just the original unit that went bad but the 2nd one is doing it too. Waste of money.	-1
good	-1
Couldn't do what I wanted to do. It does work. Works with audacity , could not make it work with protools	-1
It arrived crushed.want refund.	-1
I had this hooked up to my 2010 iMac and the return RCA channel adds so much noise it is unusable.  I have a few Behringer products which are all quite cheap, a USB mixer, a headphone amp.  None of them are as low quality as this.  Please please please if you are thinking about buying this as part of a recording setup, forget it.  Heck even if you just want to use this to get digital audio out of a computer, move one, find something else, this is horrible, trust me I am a studio engineer.	-1
sucks	-1
this device is a little to noisy for me but for some other application it may work better	-1
I got it to use it to drive a set of ear buds from my work laptop, which has the typical weak audio output or workplace computers. The output from this device was even weaker. Full volume from anything intended to drive headphones should put you at risk of earbleed. This goes back.	-1
Great idea of a very compact audio In / USB out converter, but the audio output was so high that my Windows computer had to set the audio input gain to 3 out of 100.  Wish it could have been adjustable on the unit.	-1
I could not figure out all these things and what they worked with exacly ugh so I gave it away after I asked some music store guys if went with what I got it for and didn't even I learnt you need a million things  JUST to record music apparently?!	-1
Doesn't work. Tried on 2 computers. Shows up in sound preferences, but input and output produce nothing. I've been working with sound card interfaces for computers for a little while, so yes, I made sure everything was enabled and turn up. This particular one I got sent, just didn't work.	-1
Could not figure out what it was good for...didn't have an RCA jack interface, only optical. S/pdif is old RCA stuff...why no jack???	-1
It's a fine product, but it sells for $29 elsewhere on Amazon.	-1
The identical item sells for $29 on Amazon.  BTW - it is a wonderful product.	-1
I planned to use this to record different audio sources to my PC. Unfortunately, the recording quality seems below average. It was somewhat noisy, not clear or crisp. It might be ok for everyday use, but I really wanted high quality recordings. I ended up buying a used soundblaster x-fi pro from amazon, which so far is doing the job perfectly for only 15 dollars more.	-1
First: my hearing is just regular. I have no recording experience, but I play drums and I am a beginner in recordings, very newbie though. I don't like the sound of this card. First of all I know that if you like the way your drums sound in real life, then you should expect a 99% accurate recording of them. No major tweaks should be made. My systems: Tama Drums w/Evans and Remo heads, Vaio laptop with Ubuntu OS (linux) and with Audacity software. Just did not cut it for me. I mean, the 6$ Sabre sound card, was capturing a more accurate sound than this card from Behringer. By the way, I have a Yamaha MGc102 mixer and am happy with it, now glad I did not go with a Behringer mixer... But won't rule their mixers out forever. The card works out of the box, but the sound it seems to be processed in a "wrong way", too much bass - in may opinion. My bass drum sound is literally tweaked by the sound card in a plain, regular bass heard on most cheap songs. I KNOW my bass is a bit different since I've worked on tuning it to sound like Pantera, Metallica, and some other melodic metal. And in my room, it sounds like it, but through the Behringer... sounds as any other bass. Then the sound of toms... some of them (Evans - especially) are pure incorrect.  Now, after recording 2 times through Behringer, I tried my second purchased card: Vantec NBA 200U  Oh man... what a difference! Drums sound exactly as in real life. Better than my USB Sabre 6 bucks card (laptop fell, broke my card). Clear sound, short, defined. I could say which tom, cymbal was hit etc. So, go with Vantec.  NOTE: There is no output if you use Vantec on Linux (WHYYY??) What's wrong with these people not supporting Linux?? But at least you get the mic on, and it records. (or, what am I doing wrong? - yet... I know they say "Linux not supported" but still, VANTEC start supporting Linux if you want to survive! ha-ha).  Yeah, you need to reboot PC and have Pulse Audio installed, but you'll see all the digital and analog options/combinations, after reboot.  So, am still playing around. And will use the Behringer on my other PC whose sound card is "half fried" hopefully will get a good output from there, without recording, just regular use. Cheers all, thanks for reading.	-1
Ok I understand it now - I use Abelton Live 8 and thought this would be and easy, read cheap, interface to record some instruments with. WRONG! I am returning it. It does not work, has no drivers and is not detected on my Mac (my Mac finds everything). Bought the Focusrite unit instead. Got it to work on garage band but latency was miserable and so was hiss on recordings. Save your money and time. Buy the Focusrite interface or one of the others. Yes over $100 but you either want feedback, hiss and frustration or you want a smooth interface connection with good resonance. It also lacks 1/4 plug, one rca input, you need an addapter. Not what I thought I was getting - dumb me.	-1
My U Control seems to be the reason why my microphone keeps making a static noise, and i don't understand why, it's been holding me back on recording, so I am disappointed. :/	-1
It was a promising little device, but it's too noisy to actually use.  By "noisy" I don't mean a little.  I mean it has a continuous, very audible noise, even with nothing connected to it.	-1
I was really excited to receive this product until I tried to install it. The installer fails with a 'source file not found' error message. My PC is a newer Windows 7 PC and I do not have any problems with other software. I went to the ToonTrack website and found that this problem has existed since 2011 and ToonTrack has yet to fix it! I was not able to find an updated installer at their website. Very disappointing!  Update ======== Ok, here is the scoop. Before you attempt to install EZ Drummer, fill your Pez dispenser with valium and prepare a large pitcher of margaritas.... you will need it!  1: First off , the CD installer is crap (see above).  You need to get the program from the TuneTrack website. 2: Before you can find or download the product from the website, you need to create an account and identify your sequencer (reaper for me). 3: Download EZ drummer from the ToonTrack site to your desktop and unzip. 4: Install EZDrummer from the msi installer (windows install).   when the install is complete, the installer just disappears.... no desktop icons or hints what to do next. 5: Locate the pdf manual for EZ Drummer in the zip file you downloaded.   The manual says the EZDrummer.dll (VST) is installed in the sequencer's (reaper) VST folder..... not correct 6: The VST is installed in C:\program files\VSTPlugin folder.   You need to manually move/copy the EZDrummer vst to your sequencer's VST directory. 7: Upon starting your sequencer, your sequencer should find the EZDrummer dll.   you will be prompted for serial number, computer name,... and online registration will occur. 8: With a little bit of luck, your install should only take one hour.   It took me close to 4 hours to figure out how to work around the convoluted install process and many documentation errors.  You should note that the registration process precludes you from installing this product on more than 2 PCs. I have 4 PC's that I use for music production. Good luck	-1
I bought this violin hoping to have something I can practice with in the evenings when the kids are asleep. My daily player is a nice French made JTL Campagnon acoustic violin and I have been playing now for 7 months after a 23 year absence.  The sleek looking body and the numerous positive reviews were very encouraging to me. Unfortunately, this violin is a very poor player. The plastic pegs slip in the peg box and the action is too high. I changed the pegs to ones made of ebony and I replaced the tailpiece with a Wittner model that has built in fine tuners. Now the tuning is stable. The action is still very high and you will need to adjust the height of the bridge by shaping it. It's hard but doable. Even then the nut is extremely high. So, you will need to cut down the nut and shape it.  The violin does produce a sound. You can listen to it through headphones or hook it up to an amp (like a guitar amp). The tone and volume knobs work very well together and you get a wide range of textures. Go ahead and run the sound through an effects processor to get distortion, reverb, echo, etc. It will do that and for that it earns one star.  In the end, if you are a serious student or player then this violin will seem like a toy at best. It will disappoint you if you expect something that you can pull out of the box and start playing after minimal setup. A good setup with new strings, tailpiece, properly fitted pegs, and nut shaping can run $150+ and that's not worth it for this violin. If you want a toy to screw around with or if you want a project to putz around with then this violin will be fine. Otherwise, save your money for something else. At least get something with as many wood fittings as possible.	-1
I didn't like the advertising it was misleading so now I'm stuck with something I thought was the right product instead I got the wrong product	-1
Too hard to locate holes for pins . Can get much cheaper on e-bay , go with hipshot tuners .	-1
Not usable on my 1971 Strat.  You don't see it until the product arrives but it has two guiding pins that must already be in your guitar in order to use these.  Unless you want to "try" to line these up perfectly and then drill 12 holes in the back of your headstock.  More photos would have been really helpful.  Come on Fender, are you really that lazy?	-1
I like the product but I strongly dislike that they don't put any instructions in the packaging. And the product description and photos don't explain or show that you need to drill small peg holes for the tuners to lock.  There is also no explanation showing how to use these tuners. If you're familiar with standard tuners, it will take a bit of figuring out to get it down.	-1
very nice	-1
I bought these, and although they look very nice, two of them came defective, and that is unacceptable. The string capturing shafts slid out of the base.  Not the solid sound I was looking for.	-1
These tuners are NOT the same as on the American Deluxe series. These tuners are a fender accessory, but the American Deluxe series has locking tuners that are chrome, matching the rest of the instrument's hardware, and they have the fender logo on them.  This item is functionally fine and it does fit the Fender necks, but will not match the rest of your hardware if you have an American Deluxe, American Standard, Mexican standard, etc.	-1
Keep your money	-1
light has a problem with staying lit. has some kind of short in it. when it is on it work fine.	-1
This would be great if only the light were brighter. A brighter light and bigger battery seem to be needed.	-1
Not very bright. Not very flexible. Too big. Clunky. I really don't like it. I wish I had went in a different direction.	-1
I really like this at first.  The ability to operate each light independantly added flexibility over the reglar stand lights.  However, after less than 10 uses (maybe 12 hours of light), the bulbs on one side flicker so bad I can't use it.	-1
Our worship team has coined these "Might Be Brights" due to their unreliability.  I originally had this as 2 stars because they were bright enough, but I just can't count on these anymore.  They chew through batteries for us. 3 AAA last maybe 1 month being used 3 hours / week, and after 2 services, the lights go dim and start to flicker.  We often have to flick them with our fingers to keep them turned on.  It's not uncommon to see 3 or 4 of these clipped to each music stand, because the first couple pairs just didn't want to work that day.  In other words: I have no idea why these things get such good reviews.  Save your money.  Buy something nicer.  We are now trashing 10+ of these and looking for something more reliable.	-1
The lights are not very bright and one of my lights does not stay lit and with turn off with stage vibration. I am going to buy a heavier duty, and brighter light for use on stage	-1
I was looking for a lamp for my grand piano's music stand in order to avoid having a plugged-in floor standing lamp next to me while practicing, as floor space is very limited in my bedroom with the piano and bed. There is a strong (3000 lumen) floorstanding light in the corner of the room by the tail of the piano, but it lights towards the ceiling and doesn't provide enough coverage on the music stand to sightread.  After reading the reviews here, I went to buy this lamp at Guitar center for the same price as Amazon. I asked to see it in action before purchase, but they wouldn't demo it for me.  This lamp is simply not bright enough to adequately cover 2 pages of sheet music. In particular, there is not enough light at the bottom of the music stand.  To get an acceptable amount of light, one has to position both necks very close to the page (2 inches), but then the light will cover only half of one page. I estimate that one would need at least about 4x as much light as this lamp provides. It is too bad that lamp manufacturers do not quote the lumen on their lamps as this problem would be easy to spot if they did.  Unfortunately for me, Guitar center doesn't accept returns on lamps. So this lamp is now useless to me. If you still want to buy this lamp, get it from a place that accepts returns like Amazon.	-1
I am a tall DJ at 6'3", and I wanted a stand that was 39"-40" high; I am sure that a majority of my back problems are spent DJing on inadequate, short surfaces. The specification say that this stand extends up to 38" high, so while that wasn't quite as high as I'd like, I'd be satisfied at 38". The stand DOES NOT extend to 38" safely - it extends to 36 3/4" on the final height adjustment hole that the bolt goes into - this may sound like splitting hairs, but for me, a world of a difference to my back. You can, in fact, physically extend the height to the stated height of 38", BUT THERE'S NO HOLE AFTER 36.75", so you'd be pushing the bolt literally onto flat metal - ABSOLUTELY UNSAFE and the laws of physics will slide it down under high weights, eventually, unexpectedly. I now am at a crossroads of drilling another hole to achieve the full 38" - altho I am now questioning the stability of the stand with the shaft being raised to a point that's < 2" from its end. That in itself may hinder stability. I will be writing to On-Stage for an explanation.  Otherwise, it's a fine stand at a good price, and is the sturdiest solution for me as a DJ to my knowledge (anyone with any other suggestions?). Hate to give it 2 stars but I bought it specifically for the 38" height.	-1
After two months not heavy use, the sound ceased to work. Flash only. I changed battery, no help. I took it apart to see if any other soldered points on components were cracked, but the sound unit is under the circuit board, which has no screws so no help there; I can resolder but not if I have to potentially break something to get to it. Money out the window. My 80's era old one, BTW, is going strong and actually does more. Not recommended.	-1
I think the attraction for this is it's simplicity - no menus or screens to deal with.  Unfortunately I found it difficult to use because I can't see the scale.  They used small white numbers on a red background then compounded the problem with a CLEAR marker.  Go ahead and zoom in on the display - terrible design.  It also only steps in 4 beat increments - you want 75 or 90 BPM?  Forget it.	-1
I owned the Seiko SQM-357 for over 30 years and bought the SQ50-V so I could retire the SQM before it broke. For my purposes, the only improvement of the SQ50-V over the oldie but goodie is the volume control. The two different click settings and the addition of the B-flat tuning drone is of no use to me.  There are four negatives, hence the poor rating.  The first negative is the On/Off switch.  The SQM switch was broad and flat and didn't dig into one's thumb. The switch on the SQ50-V is a sharp, tiny nub of plastic that digs uncomfortably into my flesh--I don't like it at all. The second negative is the display. The old model was painted with concentric circles of black and blue and was embossed with metallic lettering. The beat pointer was red. The old design was highly readable from 18 inches away in a variety of lighting conditions.  The new design isn't quite as large and I don't find the red and white to be quite as readable.  The clear pointer is practically invisible so I just use the "Quartz Metronome" lettering on the dial, which is aligned with the pointer.  It works, but why'd they feel like they had to change a perfectly good face design?  The third negative is the stand. The SQM stand allowed the metronome to lie back at an angle that put the face in a plane parallel to my face. The SQ50-V is too upright and hence the face is more difficult to view.  I often have to tilt it to see the display clearly. The fourth negative is the size.  I don't mind the metronome being heavier than the old SQM models that I and others miss, but the larger size, in all three dimensions is unacceptable.  Isn't advancing technology supposed to make things smaller and lighter?  What did Seiko think they were doing when they cosmetically and functionally ruined their almost perfect metronome designs, the late and great SQM-35x models?	-1
The BILL-ME-LATER $10 for $50 discount is a DIRTY TRAP to get your personal information. It will tell you "It can not apply to this production..." after you filled in your information. It didn't ask you much but only YOUR NAME and ADDRESS, and then it denied you (I'm sure it denies everyone) after it got your info.  I bought a H4 last year and it is a great handy recorder. Now the "Bill Me Later" is making this product and Amazon look BAD.  This is not about that $10 discount but the principle and honestness. Now I've changed my mind not to buy one more H4 from Amazon. I have been buying a lot from the Amazon although I know there are many other online places where I could get the same product with less. Amazon gave me confidence of buying from them. Now now I'm doubt... Well, enough about this.  Thanks and God Bless You All !	-1
I suppose this is a product that can be improved in many area: 1. User interface - not easy at all for a techie 2. Background noise can be cancelled (microphone seems okay to capture the show) 3. The recording part from other media should be improved. (Should have a linein for microphone for computer synthesized music)	-1
I wasn't pleased with this item. I returned it for a refund.	-1
Although the cable functions, I am not happy with the quality. My main gripe is that the rubber piece where the cable meets the connector fell out of the connector with almost no pressure whatsoever applied to it. The purpose of this piece is to keep cable bending force from getting inside the connector and damaging the connections between the wires in the cable and the connector pins (usually solder connections). With the rubber piece not serving this purpose, the cable is likely to fail much sooner than it should. I tried to force the rubber piece into the connector but was unable to. Maybe if I disassemble the connector... but hey, I shouldn't have to do that. Maybe this cable is OK for a studio where it is installed and never moved, but I would never take it out on a gig.	-1
The strap hole is way too small for any of my instruments, and the strap itself is very small. Also the color depicted for my version is a dark red, but it's more a bright Clifford the big red dog red. The strands are small enough to go under a classical head stock, which is appreciated. However, I'll need to buy another strap. This one is not dependable.	-1
Definitely good for the price, but the material seems a bit cheap. Mine also came a bit dirty with the "leather" part frayed. Does really affect the usage and it definitely a good strap for 5 dollars  Bit of an update, I've had to stop using the strap because it causes strain on my shoulder and back, really don't recommend this to anyone planning of regular using the strap, or with heavier guitars	-1
Piece of junk not even big enough for an acoustic, also texture is hard plastic.	-1
Disappointed. The top doesn't close properly without having to twist it with force. The internal compartment door is loose and hardly attached. There's quite a bit of glue smeared on the fabric inside the guitar. It's better than nothing but I won't buy another Gator case.	-1
This case is far too big to hold most dreadnought size guitars.  My Seagull Artist Cameo had almost an inch and a half of space the body letting it shift all over the place.  It seems well made but I have no idea what guitar would fit snugly in it .	-1
This is a piece of crap. Would probably be a good case if it wasn't so damaged. Dings and scratches. Looks like the headstock was crushed. And one of the stand buttons was smashed completely off. I give it 0 stars.	-1
I use these to replace my 3 pickup covers, a fat 50, a seymor ducan, and a fender noiseless.. Funny part is it did not fit the fender noiseless, but these did fit the other 2 pickups.... I ended up spray painting my white fender noiseless pickup cover with black lacquer paint.	-1
The dimensions provided by Gator Cases are incorrect.  The one most wrong is the body depth which is stated to be 4.5".  The depth in the bottom half of the case is only 3.25" to 3.50".  The depth in the upper half (lid) is only 0.50" to 0.75".  Even a 4.0" body acoustic guitar will not fit in this case.	-1
Says it fits mexican made players edition, it does not. I can't get them to fit on my deluxe players strat. I'm starting to get really annoyed by fender. I've tried buying a few parts made by fender for my strat. Nothing seems to fit ( except tone/volume knobs )	-1
Seriously. Get a different case. My Telecaster Clone barely fit in this. The headstock was right up against the edge. Almost no protection. The sides are so thin, they bend and give easily. I am moving across the country, having a moving company move all of my stuff. I am pretty sure I would not trust this to protect the guitar. I flipped the case over to look at the back. It was damaged. The shipping box was not damaged. Quick and easy Amazon return as usual. I am ordering a different, better, more expensive case. I recommend you do the same.	-1
I bought one from Best Buy...and if the salesman wasn't a buddy, I'd likely have passed on it.  First, it isn't typical of Gator's standards.  I own several Gator cases, and this is bottom of the barrel.  I have a Jay Turser JT200 that will live in this nicely...my other axes...no way!  This is what you might call a Bird Case.  Cheapcheapcheap.	-1
Behringer products "appear" to be a great value for your money.  However, many of their products have a short life expectancy and crap out without any warning. The K3000FX was no exception.  For starters, the stock Bugera woofers don't hold up well.  I am conservative with my volume and blew 2 of them since 2007. I also found that the plastic knobs are fragile and can break easily if you are not careful with how you load it.  The was a constant tweeter buzz that never went away.  Even with the EQ flat, the high frequencies were very harsh. 3 months after the extended warranty expired, the input board gave way.  My advice for potential buyers is to purchase the extended warranty and upgrade the stock woofer which is 4 ohms by the way.	-1
Looks and feels like poor quality plastics. What can I say? Expected more from Martin.	-1
I am using this as a keyboard amplifier; has plenty of power to play with a classic rock band; 3 inputs for separate controls; I am using this on top of a tripod speaker stand;  UPDATE: After only 88 days of use, the amp started making a bunch of noises, pops and crackles; the problem is intermittent; I contacted the manufacturer; they want me to send the unit back to them, at my expense (about $50), for repair. Be aware!  Update November 2015: I received a replacement unit from Amazon (they didn't have to!!). Starting in August I started having the same exact problems with the replacement unit that I had with the original. There are obviously some bad parts in this product. I have retired the unit and purchased an A lot unit. But, I also have a 200 Watt Behringer, and a Behringer 2,000 Watt PA that are working fine. it just seems to be this model.	-1
It didn't work out of the box.  I think that sums it up.  Also, the box is beyond shoddy.  Its my opinion that this model should be totally discontinued.	-1
Terrible. Cant get it to position right with the mechanism that it gives you with	-1
Not truly universal, when it comes to fitting other mics in it.  I keep trying, but it keeps letting me down.  I have used it, here and there, but could have saved the money for something better.  Probably should have, that is.  That's what you should do.	-1
Most mics will have a lot of extra wiggle room in this mount so just be careful not to ruin your mics.	-1
While the product came as described, the build quality felt a little lacking. On the website it mentioned that it accepts the Shure KSM32 threading but it does not, so if you're threading matches the KSM32, look elsewhere.	-1
Absolute overpriced junk! Produces much less bubbles than $35 no name machine I have. Poor design: Fan is way too powerful - strong wind prevent bubbles from forming at wands, soap liquid container build from very thin plastic (similar to disposable caps) and will not stay long, when hood opens for liquid refill, soapy liquid drops fall directly to the fan motor - it will be damaged very soon. Need to return and get proven No Name $35 snow machine.	-1
Worked great for a few months and then the engine gummed up and refuses to spin the wands around. Completely useless now. This cost more than the POS Chinese unit I had prior and that lasted way longer. Avoid this unit.	-1
I picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store.  Who doesn't need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag, right?  The price was less than ten bucks, but unfortunately it doesn't work very well.  The microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate.  It gets you in the ballpark, but just barely.  Strike a note once, and it's sharp.  Play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune.  I think the Korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better.	-1
This tuner is okay but don't get it if you just want the chord finder. If you want to learn chords just go to a website (Chordbook.com is my personal favorite). It works fine as a basic tuner but I would recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Korg-CA1-Chromatic-Tuner/dp/B002PMHAVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Korg CA1 Chromatic Tuner</a>. The Korg is a chromatic tuner which if you are a beginner means that you can tune your guitar strings to different notes than the standard E-A-D-G-B-e. Some songs require alternate tuning such as D-G-F-C-g-c. The pitch pipe feature is mediocre but it could be a lot better if they added a volume adjuster because it is very loud and gets annoying if you accidentally hit the button. It feels very cheap in your hands. Overall I would not recommend this tuner to a guitar player of any skill level.  UPDATE: I've recently returned this tuner because when I would plug my guitar into it, it would say that I was strumming a different string and it was way sharp or way flat. So basically, the one thing that was good about this tuner is now sucky.	-1
Have another Z-stand of better quality.  This one is wobbly, which is an unnecessary design flaw.  I am suprised Yamaha would put their name on it.  Kept it anyway for limited home use.  Other reviewers had forewarned consumers of this issue.	-1
Flimsy feeling, but stores easily.	-1
This doesn't do much. I see people are saying it 'holds fat books open.' All I know is it doesn't hold the first half of my 140-page beginners book open worth a darn. I'm going to try one of those clips and see if that works better. This was a waste.	-1
Does it work well?  Yes.  But this one is way too expensive.  It's taking advantage, so to speak.  You can get these at some local music shops for about $2.50 each.  That's 4 for what one here costs.  Come on....start giving a good honest deal.	-1
Had to return it. Broken pieces.	-1
Well...technically they work. Let me explain my setup. I had these going into my Baehringer mixer. Then from my mixer, into my camcorder. We had these hooked up to conduct interviews at a convention for our podcast. They worked, however the sound was coming across just a wee bit muffled and they picked up EVERYTHING. Crowd noise and all that. I expected some noise, but not to that extent. I have returned these and actually have opted for a boom/shotgun mic setup since the vocals will be more a direct pickup.	-1
Piece of junk! Returned. Attends didn't stay connected well. Horrible sound. 2 quit working after one use.	-1
This is an absolutely horrible product. Do NOT buy if you're looking for anything remotely usable.  a) Wireless packs cut out at ~50ft even with fully extended antenna's. Especially when batteries are running low. b) Batteries run out in less than 4 hours even on mute. c) Flimsy components on the headsets, one of them got destroyed by unpacking it from the plastic d) Absolutely horrible frequency response curve with audible range between 200-10k (very low voices or high pitched voices are unclear) e) Lavaliers barely pick up anything. Headsets need to be exactly in front of mouth to pick it up. Both microphone types are very much unidirectional by method of a piece of plastic tubing. f) Gain button on the wireless packs is missing (the hole is there, there is no pot) g) Squelch system does not seem to work (doesn't make one iota of difference) h) No balanced outputs (the singular XLR connector is NOT balanced) i) Large amounts of noise (hum) even when microphone is muted j) Susceptible to all sorts of interference (people walking in the path, cell phones etc) k) When batteries start to run out, the packs don't gracefully quit but keep popping in and out l) Doesn't work with rechargeable batteries (operates in the fashion as if it were a low battery)	-1
I ordered this wireless PA system from PylePro for a horseback riding/teaching facility. The unit itself worked okay at first but right from the beginning I was very disappointed in the limits for the transmitter range. When the instructor walked a mere 60 feet from the unit the signal was intermittent. I improved the signal slightly by installing an external receiving antenna just outside of the small building the equipment was installed on. The transmitting antenna on the belt transmitters are extremely poorly mounted and pulled out on both the units supplied. I understand that things like this can happen but here is the big problem. Customer service is NON-EXISTANT with this company.  I can't even count how many times I have called them and been put through their cue only to leave mutable messages for their parts/service department that NEVER gets returned! After at least ten attempts over mutable days, I finally got some guy that could barely speak English (sounded Asian) and he assured me that someone would call me next week to order parts. Guess what, no call to me was placed. Out of pure frustration I called yet again and went through their sales department pleading with them to put me through to someone that could provide me with the needed parts. It appears that they answer their sales lines. This time I finally got my order placed through a very rude employee that seemed to be put out that he had to help me. I would ovoid this company like the plague purely based on the worst customer service ever. I hate this company and will never use them again.	-1
I took a chance on these speakers. I bought 2 pair of these for our home at the beach, to go on the upper and lower porches -we are across the street from the beach. They are partially covered underneath each porch, though still exposed to the elements. They didn't last a year. The mounting hardware, and the fittings on the speakers are very flimsy. The grills are a thin metal, and so rust quickly, the terminals are not very well made, and the body is apparently not really sealed. The sound was pretty good while they lasted, but I would not recommend these for outdoor use at all.	-1
Bought this pack, took the 14 in Remo out and replaced with Evans. What a mistake, after a week of tuning and trying... got 12 year old Remo back tune 3 min, and there I was drumming as I like it.  What can I say, it just sounded bad. Lagging, long bass, too much of resonance to much of... blah.  Remo? Oh man.... what a nice crisp sound. Clear, short, to the point, good bass, good resonance, good response, stick coming back in time as you need it.  But check my review on Evans used on Bass... :)	-1
This is clearly a "toy" useful for only casual applications, like watching TV late at night with headphones. Critical adjustment and listening demands a high-equality equalizer (my system uses two A.R.T. units, being bi- and tri-amplified). I also use a Behringer digital electronic crossover, which is expensive, but had to be replaced because the first one had several malfunctions. Clearly Behringer has very poor quality control (if any).  I haven't hooked up this mini-equalizer yet to my headphone amp, but from the feel of it, it seems like a cheap, empty, plastic box. I will update my review soon.	-1
There are absolutely better choices out there.  I got this because of the price but once I received it I felt there may be further issues with it.  1) I knew this but it has only one balanced set of TRS 1/4" outputs.  The others are unbalanced RCA.  This created quite a bit of noise on my second monitors. 2) EXTREMELY cheaply built.  I like a lot of Behringer products but this one is flimsy and a light plastic.  The speaker & in cables coming from the back put enough pressure (think about it, it's only a 4 cables) on it to tilt it backwards forever more.  So either I keep it tilting or put some weights on to to prevent this...not. 3) I didn't really care about the talkback but when I tried it it was like talking into a McDonalds take out order speaker, yuk.  I am going to order a different one and return this.  It's just not worth it when you can spend a little more and get the Samson.	-1
There are 16 presets. This unit I received presets 9-12 (delay, chorus, flanger, phaser) did not work. All the other presets worked fine. I then read additional reviews of the product here on Amazon and on forums where it appears the unit has some longevity issues. In my case it came defective. I returned it for a Lexicon MX200 which is 3 times the price but with the Behringer I got what I paid for. BnB Beatles Depot	-1
Junk. save your money and buy a real pedal and run it through a good amp. Mesa boogie makes a pedal called the throttle box that slaughters any other overdrive/distortion I've played. I can do anything from texas country to full blown metal with the turn of a knob.	-1
I own 5 Hohner Special 20 and 2 Honer Blues Harp and love all of them. Got this one a few weeks at sale price but don't like it at all. I know Key F is more difficult to play because of higher pitch. But it shouldn't be this hard. Then I notice that this harmonica was made in China instead of Germany. (Should have mentioned this in product description) Is that why? or I just got a defective one? Price is low and not worthwhile to return it. I will just get another German made Hohner or a Lee Oscar.	-1
I'm still learning.  The 10 blow needed extra effort to sound; bending other notes takes some work.  It's OK if you're honking through "Oh Susanna".  You can take it apart and adjust the reed gaps, but one cover screw was stripped & needed replacement.  If you really want to learn to play, you probably want to spend more & get something like a Hohner Special 20 or a Lee Oskar Major Diatonic.	-1
I need to clarify my review. Amazon have 5 stars and A+ in the way they managed my situation. Behringer have a big 0 and F+ for not taking care of they quality control. In December 2016 I bought one of these little amps that I keep at my older son's house in Orlando, Florida. I played that thing in 5 or 6 Christmas parties going for 5 to 6 hours on continuous playing and singing. It managed like a champ at volume knob set at 5. Clear beautiful sound on my guitar and microphone. Every body was impressed. So I decided to buy one for my small gigs with family and friends down here in Puerto Rico. The first one was delayed and the tracking number was changed so no tracking was possible for it. Then I ordered a replacement. Both of them arrived. I tried the first one and the sound was really bad. No way to set it up to get what the one in Orlando produced. Sounded like a blown speaker. So, I tried the second one and to my surprise it sound worst than the first one. I invited some musicians friend that brought their guitars and microphones just to make sure that the amps were the problem. They went in love with the size and high volume they produce but the sound continued to be really bad in both amps. I wrote to Amazon customer service and they guided me to the return process and took care of freight charges for the return and refunded me for the cost of the original order. I am very satisfied with Amazon customer service. They really make you feel sure about ordering from Amazon. But Behringer should be more careful about their products quality control. It is no fun to make a return just because the manufacturer do not care. Thanks Amazon for your great customer service. Ramon Diaz	-1
I was not too thrilled with the sound of my acoustic guitar through this amp as compared to the Fender Acoustasonic 15.	-1
I have had 3 of these pedals, all of which eventually stopped working, sent them back to EHX and had them return me another each time with exception to the last, because it was going to cost me that time.. cannot be fixed at your local electricians due to the custom parts. It has been serving dutifully as a very handy paperweight though.. took very good care of these things and for as rugged as the case is, the parts inside just don't seem to hold up.. at the time I was using a 1 spot and then I upgraded to a voodoo ISO power supply and still the last one fried.. how do they keep selling this crap?	-1
This case might be okay if you are just transporting things from the trunk of your car to a gig, but this case is not worth considering if you plan to fly with it. First of all, the latches are both flimsy and exposed to shearing on both sides. This case has been through about 4 round trips, and already one of the latches is bent and coming apart. The latches can easily open during travel, so tie wraps are a must in order to secure them into place.  The case itself is okay, fairly light duty and the power strip is of nice quality.  This is not a professional product.	-1
I've tried this unit on several guitars and with other musicians who have used it in the past (in previous iterations), and I simply cannot recommend it. It's finicky, and really doesn't do what it says on the tin.	-1
The ebow might work fine without the huge crack in it	-1
This is a pretty cool device, but it didn't function exactly how I had expected. I watched some YouTube videos and saw some guitarists with a chrome one and they could actually "strum" the strings with it. This one isn't powerful enough to do that. Those videos were from the 80s or 90s I think though, so they must have redesigned it and made the signal weaker? You have to hold this on a string for a second or two before enough of a vibration builds up for the string to produce a sound. While you play around on a single string, it sounds pretty cool. If you're moving around from string-to-string, you have that period of delay when the eBow is getting the new string "up to speed" so that it's vibrating enough to be audible. It's a short period of time, but it's still somewhat limiting, I feel. All-in-all, mine is going on eBay. I'm glad a tried it out so that I can stop wondering, but I'm sorry that I had to waste some money.	-1
A PROBLEM WITH THE CONNECTION AND THE FRONT READ OUT WASNT THERE	-1
The microphone in the lavalier is terrible. Bought it for an event and it was completely useless. The transmitter and receiver are good though. If you plan to use it with something else than this lavalier, it might be good.	-1
2nd unit I bought from this company.receiver stopped working....not a happy camper with this company.	-1
Horrible and lots of static noise. Very unrealuable unit had to send it back.  Bought another product, which is more reliable.	-1
I used this in a customers home because he wanted a cheap way to Karaoke. I connected these mics and his laptop to his home theater system through a small tabletop mixer.  The range was about 60' from the base before the sound started to cut out.  When using for Karaoke, there is a slight delay from the time you speak into the mic to the time you hear it through the speakers which makes it almost impossible to use for my need.	-1
Item damage	-1
Pros: -Price point -Good, clean audio quality when working. -Changeable mesh balls  Cons: -Limited upper frequency response (>8kHz) -One stopped working after about half an hour of use. It was not dropped or abused in any way. -Requires nearly direct line of sight between transmitter and receiver for any distance greater than 10 feet.	-1
I bought this so I could modify a cordless PA system to have wireless mics as well. Before doing anything, I decided I should try it out. I took it into the high school gym and plugged it in. I walked around with both mics and talked a little bit, and everything seemed to work alright. I put everything back in the box, and the next day there was a meeting outside and they usually use a small PA system so the teacher's voice doesn't get drown out. Instead of the usual mic, I used these.  First of all, feedback rejection and the signal compression are great. It does have a compressor/expander in it to serve as a bit of an automatic gain control. The people talking held the mics at different distances from their mouths and even were doing stuff with the mics in their hands and the signal coming out of the receiver stayed the same.  But, and this is a game breaker but, every  minute or so the mics would just completely cut out, and the range was dismal at best.  At about 10 feet away, the cutting out got very bad, and even standing about 5 feet away from the receiver it would sound fine then just cut off.  I thought I was doing well by buying a name brand, even if it was a cheaper one. At least it's not Pyle or something. But now I'm questioning if I did good on these. I'm returning them right away! They're completely worthless to me.  Meanwhile, I have a set of unbranded (they just say "Professional" on the box) lapel mics that work perfectly without dropping out and with the receiver and transmitters over a hundred feet apart. That set wasn't much more expensive either and it has 4 mics!  I'm returning this and getting a used Audio Technica setup. The situations I need to use this in are critical enough that I can't have the mics cutting out and I need to have pretty good range.	-1
Check other reviews before buying.  This is terrible.  I've been playing guitar for 35 years and this is garbage.  The volume of your guitar cuts in half. It sucks tone and the sound compresses too much.  Noy even suitable for home use.  Maybe I got a bad one but we'll never know because I won't be getting another one.	-1
I purchased this item in Dec but only recently opened the package and tried it out. It is not great, if it hadn't been so long since my purchase I would send it back. you have to almost have the mic in your mouth for it to pick up your voice. I wasted my money.	-1
I bought these a couple months ago. I used them for 2 gigs. First gig was OK as it was just me talking. 2nd gig was no good. One of the mics is dead and the range is only 15 to 20 feet. At about 10 feet they drop off and get static. I keep them in the box and take care of them. I used the 10 dollar durecell batteries and buy them before each gig. This was embarassing. I had a cerimony where the transmitter was no more than 15 feet from the reciver and the pastor doing the wedding was droppin out BAD! Only about 1/2 the cerimony worked. When the mic was used for the Vows the bride had zero reception and everything she said was NOT heard! Its deadly when you have a paid gig and things do not work! So i am going back to the good ol long mic cords. More stable. I may even invest in a real mic such as sure or EV. You get what you paid for. Its not worth sending back as im sure shipping will be as much as the unit costs!	-1
I purchased this product with hopes that this would be a reliable mic. I must say that I am not happy with it. It cut off from the first event and on. I used fresh batteries and even tried out ther mic and had the same issue.  It's only 50 bucks and may just use it for when I do my restuarant shows but would not use for a wedding that features toasts, etc  I will def be looking for a more reliable wireless mic option	-1
first this only covers 1 instrument and a gemini VHF 2100 covers 2 second Nady intentionally installs an resistor/cap/attenuator to stop mic from working on this model (because they charge more for one that a microphone will work on..). gemini 2001 can handle instrument or microphone ! I thought Nady was better because all the reviews and (it costs more ...) I ended up with more feedback probs and interference from emp with this model as well. *bottom line* buy the frikn gemini and get 2 instruments OR Mics for less than what you pay for this...	-1
I bought these mics mainly for assemblies at my school.  For $50 I wasn't really expecting much, but when I tested them out I was pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and range.  I may even try them out with my acoustic duo.  I use Shure SM58s for my bar gigs and these Nady's don't sound much different.  I also put windscreens on them for protection since the other reviews mentioned that they dent easily.  I would highly recommend these for speaking and maybe karaoke.  I would probably go with something a little more sturdy if I were to use them for live music situations.  I play guitar so I really don't need wireless mics as I am stationary.  I am editing my review because I recently used these wireless mics and for some reason the signal is now very weak.  I changed the batteries hoping that this might solve the problem but they still gave me trouble even with new batteries.  A strong signal is a very important feature for a wireless mic.  Otherwise, stick with the regular mics.	-1
THESE GOT PUT IN GARBAGE AFTER 2 MONTHS OF USING THEM COUPLE TIMES NOT A GOOD BY AT ALL ,IF YOUR GOING TO USE THEM FOR TALKING ON THEY MIGHT WORK JUST FINE BUT FOR MUSIC AND SINGING WITH NOT A GOOD BUY....	-1
I have a Shure Microphone and there is no comparison in quality!!!!  Im a professional singer and know the difference in sound quality with this piece of CRAP compared to my Shure.  This makes the voice sound awful!!!!  It eats 9Volt batteries too, I can't believe they are selling this "Throw In" microphone for for $50 bucks, I had this thrown in with a package deal when I ordered my equipment (speakers, CD player etc...)  Im glad I didn't pay $50 dollars or I would have sent it back for my money back!!!  Just a molded piece of empty plastic with no substance what so ever.  Hold a Sure microphone and hold this-NO COMPARISON WITH SUBSTANCE!!!	-1
ALL THIS DOES IS TURN IT ON AND TURN IT OFF, USELESS...	-1
It's OK for what it is -- a PICCOLO stand.  It will not hold a regular size flute (which is not on the advert)	-1
I purchased the Hercules GS414B A/G Guitar Stand recently and after reading reviews about this bag, I decided to purchase one to make carrying my GS414B stand  a little easier (September 2014).  The material is just average and I am not crazy about the big bright yellow name on the bag or the bright yellow carrying strap. They shout advertisement for the manufacturer. The bag itself is almost too short to accommodate  the GS414B stand even when it is collapsed to its minimal length. The drawstring barely closes around the stand.  I may look  around for a different bag which is a better fit  for the GS414B and which is more conservative in appearance.  Update: October 11, 2015 After a year of toting the bag twice each week, the stand is beginning to punch a hole in the bottom of the Carry Bag. Reason? There is no reinforcement inside the bottom of the bag and the feet of the guitar stand eventually wears on the fabric of the bag. Considering the price, Hercules could have made the bag about 3 inches longer to accommodate the Hercules GS414B stand  and should have definitely added a piece of hard plastic or similar material on the inside bottom of the bag to provide protection from the feet of the stands being placed in the bag. Suggestion to Hercules...forgo the large bright yellow name brand on the bag and instead make it longer and reinforce the bottom on the inside.  Update: Here is the status of the bag as of 12/24/2016. A large hole in the bottom rendering it almost useless. Has been like this for about one year but just decided to take the time to update and add the photo.	-1
I bought a set, tried them on a few of my violins and can't say that they did anything for me.  They took away any edge and interest from the violins, making it warm, soupy and bland.  The gold e was unremarkable, except that it makes the set more expensive.  They are heavy and not very responsive.  I think from reading the boards, that people primarily buy them to tone down a brash, harsh, shrill violin.  So they seem to be a fixer-upper string, if you have a misbehaving violin, they will make the sound more pleasant and smoother.  However, on responsive high end violins, they take away the sizzle and spark.  I have also heard that they don't last long, and as one luthier joked, they're called "Obligato" because they oblige you to buy another set soon.  Beware if the luthier fits a violin with Obligatos, he is trying to give you a warm rich sound on a violin that has the shrill nasties and only after the trial period is over do you realize the strings have gone false, and the sound has deteriorated.  (insert smiley, half joking)  That said, I'll give it 2 stars because I'm sure there are violins out there where these strings are a perfect fit for, and someone out there will swear by them and love them.	-1
Like the strings, they sound warm and rich. Should be 5 stars. However, 10 days after a luthier put these on, the e-string snapped at the peg when I tuned it slightly.  I couldn't communicate with the seller except to return these -- and I didn't want the hassle of taking all the strings off, sending back, waiting another 2 weeks then having to restring before playing the violin.  So I ended up buying e-string only for additional $15 instead of having this seller replace them. From the reviews, sounds like I'm not the only one this has happened to. Would really like a credit for additional cost.	-1
I only tried the A string - since these are expensive I thought I'd start with one string.  I hated it.  It sounded shrill and tinny.  I tried these on two different violins.  I have since read that the remaining strings are superior to the A (they'd have to be).  I'm wondering if I just got a bad string?	-1
Warning for Windows 7 users, especially 64-bit versions: Do not purchase! M-Audio advertises that the product is Windows 7 compatible, both on website product description and a sticker on the box. I bought mine from Guitar Center for my son in college, and he could not install it at school. I came to his dorm and tried with no luck, so I took it home to get it going.  The reality is that if you try to install from the included CD, it will not work at all. Then you go to the M-Audio web site, and there is a Win7 driver, both for 32 & 64 bit. Fine. However, the KeyRig 49 software player DOES NOT FUNCTION with Win7 of any flavor, and M-Audio has no intention of supporting Win7 at all. This is really deceptive advertising. Unfortunately, I can't take it back to GC, as his dorm-mate pitched the box, and it's after the 30-day limit.  Note that this USB MIDI interface does work with third-party software like the NI KONTAKT4 player, but the point of the product for our use was a low-cost "mini-piano" for his keyboarding class.  Unfortunately, this sort of SW costs at least $100.  All of the freeware and shareware virtual instrument players are ancient, supporting only XP at best.  Most are Win98!  I looked around at other M-Audio products, and it appears their software development staff are either Mac-only types, or are newer Windows version ignorant. I'd suggest going elsewhere for modern Windows supported solutions for music HW & SW.	-1
I bought this keyboard from Best Buy. It is not a very good keyboard. It has the following problems: When you are in the normal Octave (both octave lights on the left are on which is the default), when you go into G4 and above which are on the right, the keyboard produces a very muted sound. It is a drastic transition from F4 to G4 keys. It sounds OK when you set the keyboard to a lower octave. Also, in the normal octave mode, chords A minor and C sound the same. This is because when you hit the A minor chord the A note is hardly heard.  Now I am looking at options. May be it is the particular piece that I got.	-1
I purchased these for on stage gigging use. They fail miserably because one of the feet is located EXACTLY where my output jack is and pushes the instrument out of vertical and is unstable unless unplugged. I suppose if all you need is a display stand that never sees a stage then you could use it to store an instrument while unplugged and it would be OK.	-1
I loved the design of this stand, very stable and it looks cool, but I just now noticed it has damaged the finish on the top of my $4000 ES 335. Instead of keeping the nice soft foam rubber coating all the way to the end, the geniuses at Hercules put hard rubber caps on the end. These caps have sharp edges, and over the months I've had this thing, unseen by me, these sharp edges have been slowly grinding away at the guitar's lacquer finish. So no, I cannot recommend this stand. And now I have a refinishing job ahead of me. Thanks, Hercules.	-1
Didnt work for me but my grandson claims he loves them.	-1
Not good for me..may work well for others.	-1
waste of money. Pure junk	-1
Good idea, but they are uncomfortable on my fingers and don't stay in place no matter how much I adjust them. The sound they produce is less harsh than a standard Dunlop banjo fingerpick, so it would be nice for some guitar work if I could make them stay in place.	-1
