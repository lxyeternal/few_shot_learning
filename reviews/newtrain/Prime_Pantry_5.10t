Very satisfactory	1
I like not having to unload the groceries. Fresh and last a long time.	1
My favorite mayonnaise and we use it quite frequently The price was good.	1
Only Best Foods. Good price	1
Along with Helman's my favorite mayo	1
Price was equal to the stores..........have been a Best Foods fan since longer than I can remember.	1
Best foods makes a great mayonnaise. It is tasty and smooth and I love its flavor. This is for sure my favorite!	1
Excellent for my special recipes	1
I have tried other mayos but Hellman's is still the best.	1
Hellman's is the best!	1
Um, the ONLY mayonnaise! Salad dressings are not mayo. Mayo is made with egg whites. I only use Hellman's, no matter what "project" I'm working on.	1
good	1
Hellmann's always tastes great.	1
It's pretty good, but it's a little more dry than I would like. It would be nice if it was a little creamier. There isn't much cheese flavor, or broccoli, but it's still pretty good. It cooks really fast. All you need is 1/2 cup milk and some water. You can use butter too, if you want. I didn't use butter. Maybe that's why it was a little dry, but the directions said it was optional.	1
This is such a quick and easy side dish (or great as a snack on its own!) - you just add water, milk and butter, boil and simmer and it's done! The whole family loves this Cheddar Broccoli mix and yes, there is broccoli to be found in it (unlike some where you can't tell if it is broccoli or parsley flakes lol). Depending on preference and portion size, you can get 2 to 4 serves from this one pack - and what a bargain price! I know I'll be stocking up:)	1
Doesn't need to be a side dish. Throw in other staples it become a one course meal.	1
I have to be honest, these are awesome. I have been a Lipton noodle fan for a long time but these have ACTUAL pieces of broccoli in them (not ust a thousand little pieces of flowerets lol) ! At first I thought my boyfriend added them but nope. Delicious side to go with just about anything you can think of!	1
This is a family favorite!  I was excited to find a Prime Pantry deal for this, so I stocked up!  :)  Great flavor, great consistency, easy for my teenage daughter to cook to go with dinner!	1
As expected	1
good	1
One of the better sides that they have. Good enough to have by itself but again, It's better when paired with something.	1
nice	1
It is not all that good, but it works	-1
Great healthy taste	1
Love it	1
Awful as no taste and the broccoli was a joke as the total amount was like taking 1/2 of one small floret and cutting into micro pieces then using half of that. Wasted money do not buy.	-1
This stuff is great, we like to chop up fresh broccoli though and mix it in since the pasta itself doesn't have very much.	1
Our 2nd favorite Mac-n-Cheese mix, just behind Knorr's 4-Cheese.	1
always good and easy to cook	1
They great tasteing	1
As described	1
Had no idea how good these would be ! Seriously ! You won't be disappointed in this product ! Have ordered this many times and will continue to do so ! And its very easy to make ! It only takes about 25 minutes from start to finish ! And makes great left overs ! As you can see in my picture !	1
we love this pasta dish as a side dish .  good price and great taste	1
We love these even as a main dish.	1
Awesome	1
Most awful thing ever! Tastes like old shoes or dirty socks would. Would not even insult a dog with this slop.	-1
I've bought these noodles a bunch. Love them.	1
Great side dish!	1
Tastes good. Easy to make. Inexpensive. Works for me.	1
Good side dish !!!	1
Not quite as easy as had hoped.  Just slightly easier than homemade but good price point.	1
yum	1
Use these products for everything ! even by themselves! buy all the time	1
Nice	1
Good	1
Easy and quick to prepare, great taste, my kids love it!	1
I've eaten these many a time. The Cheddar Broccoli is one of my favorites of this brand.  I like this with Heinz Ketchup&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Heinz-Tomato-Ketchup-32-Ounce/dp/B000WHXN3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Heinz Tomato Ketchup, 32 Ounce</a>&nbsp;or sometimes French's Spicy Brown Mustard&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/French-s-Spicy-Brown-Mustard-18-ounce/dp/B019G3DIDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">French's Spicy Brown Mustard, 18 ounce</a>. I know that probably grosses some people out, but I also know there are a few of you out there that understand. Sometimes I take a small carrot and slice it up in really thin small pieces and add it to the water. If cut thin it's done cooking when the noodles are done. I've even made some whole grain raisin bread toast, cut up in bite size little pieces and put it in the bottom of the bowl before adding the noodles. It's an unassuming combo that really hits the spot.  I don't bother with the milk part of the directions, and just substitute all water and add more butter. I also like to add a little Italian seasoning and maybe some paprika, black pepper and turmeric while it's cooking.	1
Tasty rice.  Easy to prep.	1
Nice side dish or small meal.  Can be spruced up easily to make a main dish. Not non GMO, organic or low sodium, but doesn't pretend to be.  Quick, easy, inexpensive.  Noodles have a nice tooth.  Nice to have in the cabinet for emergencies.	1
These took forever to cook - much longer than package states. Then it was bland.	-1
When I bought this, I was thinking I was buying the broccoli rice and cheese flavor. It wasn't until I poured it out into my pot that I realized I got the pasta one. My Mom would always get on to me about not reading before I do things....But, it was a nice surprise, and with the fun twisty pasta, that hugged and the cheese sauce coated it nicely. I added more broccoli and it was yummy to our tummy, as my niece likes to say.	1
tasty and not too salty	1
Great product for the price!	1
Its Ok but I tend to make this myself	1
good stuff	1
handy substitute meal preparation for lazy people	1
Better than decent	1
I LOVE THESE THINGS. JUST HAD SOME FOR LUNCH AND ADDED SOME HAMBURGER FROM MY LEFT OVER TACOS THE OTHER NIGHT AND IT WAS SMACKING.	1
Fresh	1
Was open when it arrived, had to throw it away, not worth enough to try to send it back.	-1
good	1
I could not hate this more. I bought it by accident, meant to get the Cheddar Broccoli Rice, this is the pasta. Maybe it's a preference thing, but pasta does not work with this...the rice is much better.	-1
ARRIVED AS EXPECTED, LOVE IT WHEN I CANNOT LEAVE TO HAVE THIS SERVICE!!	1
I love this product, and others like it. I could make a meal out of one package...just add shrimp, chicken, or whatever type of "meat" you like. Woild recommend.	1
prime pantry staple	1
Nice quick side dish for our family at meal time instead of potatoes all the time. Kids liked them to so we get some of the many different kinds.	1
We liked it. I added more broccoli.	1
good stuff	1
I buy these at the store and they are amazing. But they had a coupon here so they were a steal	1
is my new favorite	1
decent freeze-dried dish	1
Product is as described. I would purchase again.	1
Great side	1
Can't go wrong with this little package of Pasta - definitely make on STOVE - it is  much better if you add more broccoli to this dish.  The broccoli in Knorr's package are 'spec' can hardly see em. I made this dish with 2 cups of milk, 2 tbsp. of butter, NO water and it makes it a much richer sauce.  Then I followed the Knorr's directions.  Letting this sit in pan for (5) five minutes and the added (1) cup of Augason Fram Broccoli Florets freezed dried.  Rather expensive but excellent if you don't have access to fresh vegstables, like me.  .  Don't hesitate - wonderful product.	1
Great product with quick delivery.	1
As a quickie meal I added frozen shrimp and it was a winner.	1
Fairly tasty, cheap.  I suggest adding normal broccoli to it once you make it. It's the cheap m&c cheese powder though, so...	1
Yum	1
Good and well priced. Arrived on time, in good condition and posted expiration of this product is well into the future.	1
GREAT BUY	1
Use about once a month with beef or chicken.	1
healthy side dish quick and easy	1
These are great. So yummy!	1
Good & easy.	1
These are delicious. I had my doubts however we tried them last night with chicken and they were a hit with the whole family. Will be ordering more.	1
very versatile	1
wonderful product; exactly as promised.	1
taste great	1
These sides are really easy to make and the taste is great.  I sometimes put browned hamburger in pan and use it as a main dish.  Also, try crumbling in some crisp bacon..Yum!	1
Delicious as a side dish or converted to a meal! I love that these pasta sides are super quick and do not require ingredients that I don't have on hand. This cheddar broccoli pasta tastes great! I love to add extra broccoli and diced chicken to make a more filling meal!	1
Was OK when mixed with frozen broccoli, but very salty.	-1
very easy side dish	1
Arrived quickly, accurately described and tastes good.	1
yummy	1
This is one of my regular side dishes I like to make with dinners. It is a cheddar broccoli rice mix and goes good with just about anything. The flavor is great and has enough cheese flavor. I like these because they are quick and easy to make when your trying to cook dinner. You can also use them as a complete meal by just adding some meat in the rice and you have yourself a casserole. I trust Knorr sides they are good quality.	1
This pasta mix was much better than I expected. It was creamy and tasted wonderful. This is an item that I will definitely be reordering. It went great with my steamed chicken and mixed vegetables. Thanks.	1
Great food when you have no time to cook.	1
Prepare a couple of packages, add chopped or shredded white chicken meat, top with shredded cheese and you have a quick and easy dinner casserole. Reheats easily, too.	1
Absolutely perfect!! Just what I was looking for and at a great price as usual on amazon!! Super fast shipping as expected :)	1
This is a great side dish at a cost that is also great.	1
These were good but not great. They do add on for a nice side dish with chicken or pork.	1
Another handy side dish... good just 'as is' , and lends itself to extra 'fixins' for a more substantial meal.	1
quality goods .	1
I love everything made by Knorr.  I have never found anything they make that I don't like and I've tried it all.  These are great to have on hand for an easy side dish.  I also often add meat and vegetables and make the main entree with it as well when I get off work and don't feel like doing a lot of cooking.  I order these in bulk with my prime pantry box and so happy to have them around.  There were coupons available too so they were cheaper than I could buy at the store.	1
this is prefect and helps my daughter get what she needs delivered at college.	1
Delicious!	1
Good quality and price. Great service. Very functional.	1
very tasty ordered several times	1
Quick and easy for a busy life!	1
Quick, easy to cook, economical and my boys love them.	1
love	1
OMGosh this pasta is so good. I don't know why the servings are so small though. Every company does that with food packages. The broccoli is great, not big flora..just tiny amount. The cheese is delicious. I usually pair with some type of meat and veggie for dinner. I highly recommend!!!	1
great taste and texture, prefect with chicken	1
In a world filled with stress of all kinds, I feel strongly that dinner shouldn't be one of them.  I've used packaged (rice and noodle) side dishes for years to help incorporate more veggies into our meals.  I frequently add a handful or two of chopped fresh vegetables to them, and this one was no exception.  Over the years, I have found our taste preferences lean more to the Knorr brand of sides when it comes to the pasta sides. (The rice based sides are a toss-up with a different brand.) Maybe this is because long before Knorr produced these, they sold sauce packets of all the traditional sauces used in cooking.  I often used those sauces when I was introducing new vegetables to the family because it was easier to sell "Brussel sprouts with Alfredo sauce" to kids who love all things Alfredo.  I feel that having something familiar along with the new food made it much more likely for them to at least try some without putting up a fuss.  The kids are all grown and it is now just my husband and me.  (I am proud to say that there are very few vegetables they do not eat.)  The Knorr packages are the perfect size for two people, unlike most food products on the grocery shelves, and I appreciate that.  I also admit to adding a small can of tuna or chicken breast to a package and calling it lunch when I don't feel like eating a sandwich, and we don't have any leftovers in the refrigerator.  This particular selection was not one of my favorites but only because I found the noodles difficult to deal with.  They wanted to slide off the fork!  It won't keep me from buying it again though and maybe I will try eating with a spoon.	1
great	1
great sides.	1
Yum. Quick and easy to make.	1
A great side for most all dishes. Very tasty and easy to make. Have bought this for years and will continue to. Knorr's has a good product line.	1
This is coming from a person who is not a big pasta fan. This is probably as good as any other. It's easy for a single guy. Just add some veggies & it's a simple fast meal.	1
really surprised on this one liked it alot	1
Love this! Exactly what I was looking for!	1
Very good would buy again thanks	1
Great Stuff!	1
This wasn't bad, but wasn't good either.  Very bland, and what broccoli there was, was just single little buds.	-1
Great!	1
Tastes good and easy to make.	1
Yummy !	1
This one was actually surprisingly tasty and the size if the meal was decent.  I'd buy it again !!	1
Pretty decent, but comes out with a "sticky" consistency.	1
We really like the convenience when out traveling.  We have not found a Near East product we did not like.	1
Completely Smashed!!	-1
good for side	1
My family loves the simplicity of these sides. Really helps to keep wholesome meals during busy times. Just add a good meat and make a selection of side dish. Helps us when sports and school or just a lazy dinner night. To me, it is a much better option then deciding on going to fast food. Pros: Easy to make Great selection of flavors Quick Convenient Very Cheap  Cons: Not as healthy as homemade 20  *This review is my honest opinion of the product. I may have been compensated for this review with discounts in exchanged for an honest unbiased opinion.	1
I love stocking up on these for quick dinner sides, or even as a quick meal for Soccer nights. Really good!	1
Wonderful price, and love to have the convenience of amazon prime pantry!  The ability to clip coupons on some items is also great!	1
Great taste. I thought I ordered rice but I didn't know they made these in pasta. It was my own error though and they are really good!	1
Cant beat the flavor	1
Very quick and great taste!	1
Quick, easy side dish or a nice warm lunch addition for the kids. Definitely not enough broccoli, but I like to add a handful or two of fresh broccoli into mine to improve the taste and make it a more hearty meal.  You can make it in the microwave or stovetop. Serving size is 2. 310 calories per serving. May contain sulfites. Cooking time on the stove top is ten minutes once you have the water boiling. One complaint is that the nutritional information on the front (240 calories, 4g of sugar etc.) is for the DRY mix, which you are obviously not going to eat without adding the rest of the ingredients.	1
it's vaseline	1
makes the best dry skin crme and I like the small package.	1
Best way to buy and distribute Vaseline!	1
I use this all the time	1
It's Vaseline in a travel size.  It's the same reliable product and the tube doesn't leak.  All good.	1
Nice travel size	1
Works	1
Wife loves it and have to keep them coming from Amazon to keep the shelf stocked.  Smell stays with you a long time after the bath, so that better be what you like.	1
Gf is happy so I'm happy	1
All i know is my husband sniffed at me for over an hour. and didn't want me to leave the house. This makes this fragrant body wash a winner for me. I will be buying this again and wearing it with caution. We are now expecting a baby. LOL.	1
Thus caress scents is one of my favorites! It smells so good. Will order again!	1
great, long-lasting scent!	1
super !	1
It has so much dye which is both bad for skin and the shower; it gets EVERYWHERE!	-1
Smells great! Comparable to premium shower gels from Bath and Body Works. My husband accidentally used this instead of his shower gel and started yelling "I think I'm bleeding!" The shower gel is a deep red and he wasn't expecting it! Haha! Bonus star for entertainment value!	1
smells great!	1
Wonderful body soap for the shower.	1
This product is horrible and contains way too much dye. I receive a small sample size from RueLaLa and it RUINED my tile. I tried bleach, CLR, acetone---nothing cuts this stain! Horrible product that has cost me a great deal of money. Zero stars or -5 stars is more appropriate. What were they thinking? Any suggestions on removing the stains would be most appreciated!	-1
Caress body wash, love forever is a fabulous scent.  The smell lasts long, and cleans well.  The color is a pretty pinkish red and the bottle lasts a long time, through many, many, many uses.  I would recommend this fragrance LOVE FOREVER, it is perfect.  Caress leaves you body feeling soft.	1
I kept buying the heavy-duty anti-perspirants which never worked.  I bought this on a whim and love it.  It's my new go-to deodorant.	1
I purchase this for my spouse mainly because the smell is subtle and I love it.  I absolutely HATE the smell of men's deodorant.  He doesn't like it either and since the woman is supposed to like how a man smells, men may as well smell the way we like. am I right?!	1
This deodorant has a decent smell, but be wary if you have allergies. I ended up being allergic to it. I felt it did a good job at keeping my underarms dry, but I prefer aerosol or gel to these.	1
This sent smells so clean. The formula itself feels soft and goes on smooth. It also made my skin softer over time.  My rating guide: *****5 stars: Wow! This product is of awesome quality! A steal in value and definitely can live up to whatever their claims are. I will definitely be keeping and maybe purchasing more. I would recommend to friends and family. ****4 stars: Good product of quality! This item has met at least 90 percent of my expectations, The design is sound, The build is great and the product does what it was made for. Its a great product that i can recommend buying. However it didn't completely wow me. This is what most products fall under. I would not return item. ***3 stars: Product is just okay. May have some cool features but did not meet all of what it claimed it would be able to do. Something is off and you would want to be warned about it before hand of buying it. I probably will not return but it would be settling. **2 stars: Product is not the worse of the worse but is of cheap quality or does not live up to description. Would still be returning because does not meet the needs I purchased it for or that it would probably won't have longevity in my opinion. *1 star: Not worth the time or money I recommend you keep looking for something of better quality. I wish I would have not purchased and wish I could have given it no stars. Will be returning product.	1
My absolute favorite deodorant from Dove .I hope they never discontinue it . Best scent I've smelt so far and it works great at keeping me fresh all day.  No sweating and it makes my underarms super soft and clean all day long.	1
Received as described and in a timely manner.  Like this item.	1
Served it's purpose. Smells nice.	1
College Students purchase. Arrived on time without damaged.	1
Mmmmmmm!!!! Creme Brulee lip balm?? Heck yes!! Love it!! Excellent product!!	1
I don't really like it. I don't like the perfume and I don't like that it is not easy to get into the tiny box. I don't have big fingers but I didn't feel it easy.	-1
I've bought 3-4 of these now. Small enough to keep in my purse, and small enough for little gifts to put in Easter baskets or Christmas stockings. Smell is nice too. I'll be buying more to stash!	1
I love how adorable this is! It is a little thicker than regular Vaseline, I've noticed, but I was hoping it would actually be flavored, or at least have a slightly stronger scent. I think the cocoa butter Vaseline smells better, honestly, but this works better for its intended purpose, so I'll keep using it..plus I just love seeing it! It's so cute!	1
works  very well	1
LOVE this little plastic jar, great for carrying in purse or travel bag!  Easy to refill from a larger container.	1
really cute and very small women love to carry in purse	1
Wonderful for dry winter lips.	1
Vaseline Lip Therapy Brulee is pretty good but it doesn't moisturize my lips as well as expected. It coats my lip pretty well to protect it from the elicited but does not meet my expectations.	1
Nice scent.	1
Great little lip balm. Fits into any purse or backpack easily.	1
love the smell!!	1
Excellent!	1
Perfect size to throw in your bag.	1
Great scent and perfect for lips!	1
So cute and only chapstick that I can see improves the flaking of having constantly chapped lips. It smells great!	1
great smell, a little difficult to get out when almost empty	1
I love this lip therapy from Vaseline! It helps my lips from chapping and peeling - especially during cold months!	1
Great!	1
Can I just say that this is the cutest little bottle of Vaseline I've ever purchased. I fits easily in my purse to use on the go for my chapped lips or cracked heels. My 11 years old daughter is a Chapstick junkie and asked me to pick up a few for her because she loved how small it was.	1
Smells like a nice man parfume, I hope my hubby will like it too	1
A little more expensive than other balm, but this works great!	1
This feels and smells really good. The Vasaline makes my lips feel greasy, but it stays on a long time. The jar is very, very tiny so it will fit just about anywhere. I do recommend this product.	1
Love this great little pot! I bought it because it was cute.  I rebought it because it works!  has a great scent and keeps my lips moist	1
I have had several different scents of these.  I really like the way it goes on smooth and silky.  I love the scent on this one and I love the cute little containers that look just like the big ones.	1
I love ponds. This is my go-to product for make up removal	1
I like washing my face with Ponds, it cleans and leaves my face feeling moisturized.  I am in my 40's now and can't use a cleanser that is too harsh.  I think I will keep using this from now on.	1
good	1
I find it amazing that it took me a long time to discover the wonders of Ponds. I do not wear makeup often. But when I do, I prefer to use Ponds. Everything comes out into a damp washcloth. A few times when I've overdone the eye area, I've had to do a second application but it is not often. It works perfectly well and it moisturizes as well! Perfect during dry winters.  I do occasionally use another face wash, but my go to is this product. I don't believe I have any clogged pores or unsightly blemishes.  As a mom I found another use: it will remove those tattoos kids get. You know the kind you apply with water? All you have to do I dab a good coat of ponds, wait a few minutes for it to do its magic and wipe it off (ok depending on the quality of the tattoo and how many your kid got maybe rub a little?) but it works better than anything else I've tried. You may need to re-apply.  This has a very slight fragrance. Enough that if I had my eyes closed I'd recognize it as ponds. But it isn't a perfume. The jar says it is hypoallergenic and suitable for sensitive skin. All I can say is that neither I nor my children have had a reaction to this. Although I really only use it on my kids for the aforementioned tattoos or when they've had makeup on (rather when my daughter got a hold of a lipstick...). So I am not sure about children and long term use.	1
great	1
I have ridiculously sensitive skin that tends to dry out very easily. I've been killing my pocket with natural recipes that were only somewhat effective, but I thought they were my only option because I'm allergic to so much out there. This stuff is great though. I love that it's so easy to clean my face and there's no mess. You just put it on like lotion and then wipe it off with a wet rag and you're done! You don't even have to apply lotion afterwards because it is very moisturizing, though I usually do just because my skin is very dry in general. But it doesn't leave that stretched-out cracking feeling that I used to get after washing my face. I was kind of reluctant to believe that this would have any genuine cleaning power, but it really does clean well! My pores are clear and I've used it to wash off makeup now and then and needed nothing else! The bottle seems pretty small, but it does last longer than you'd expect, so for the price it's really great. I think I've finally found my skincare routine.	1
I don't use anything other than this to remove waterproof mascara!	1
Love it.  This is what my grandma used.  I was skeptical because i thought old meant outdated.  Ponds works great to remove even the most chunky mascara!	1
So glad to be able to still get this here. I am a 35 YO "Old Lady" I've been using Ponds cold cream for years *But I hide it when guests come (don't wanna ruin my street cred, ya know) But seriously, to have been able to use a product for so many years with such a level of reliability is amazing to me. This stuff is still around because it's the real deal. Ladies (I'm looking at those painted on eyebrows and that wing tip on point) This stuff could take spackling off of your face with one swipe it's THAT good. Also it's nice and thick and has a wonderful clean smell. The way I use it to cut down on putting it on too thick is that I apply it with tissue or cotton balls then use a nice HOT damp towel and clean my whole face. It's never let me down. Thank You PONDS for never selling out.	1
Good Deal.	1
Best makeup remover ever!!	1
Love this classic cold cream	1
I like this deodorant. Dove Advanced Care Deodorant has a pleasant fragrance that is not overpowering in the least and keeps me dry. I am very pleased that I tried this and will be buying again.	1
I have very sensitive skin and this is by far my favorite deodorant.	1
Came in 2 days and love this deodorant	1
Great Product	1
Great	1
So glad I tried these. I actually like the thins better than the original. And these ones might actually be my favorite. I love the chocolate but these are so light and yummy.	1
My favorite cookie, both vanilla and chocolate thins- came unbroken and well protected	1
DELICIOUS reminds me of Vienna fingers cookies but thinner....	1
love the things. not too much cookie and easy to bite.	1
Favorite cookie and at a great price.  Always fresh and tasty.	1
Purchasing these with prime pantry is the first time I have tried them. I love Oreos, but sometimes feel like there is too much cookie and not enough cream. The thin ones are the perfect balance and taste delicious.	1
these and the chocolate are soooo good.	1
I'd not tried these so thought I'd give them a try. If you like lemon, you're gonna love these! I love these with milk but best with a good cup of tea!  I like them...a lot! And I'm not a kid either. Try them!	1
Given as a birthday gift.  I heard our Daughter-in-Law loved them.	1
delicious!	1
Good product. Good transaction.	1
If you dunk your Oreos in coffee, you will probably like the Thins because they really don't crumb up as much as the regular Oreos. You will also appreciate these if you eat your Oreos straight up, as you don't have to bite hard. If you like taking your Oreos apart, you might not like these as much because each cookie wafer is about as thin as a potato chip and they break easily when separated from the filling.	1
sweet but not too sweet. crunchy cookie. I believe it's vegan because it only contains soy. no honey, egg or milk.	1
YUM. Loving the thins, all the taste but a crispier texture.	1
Gr8	1
perfect- just enough filling	1
Like these better than originals. Perfect size!	1
yummy	1
Works great smells great	1
Very gentle on my sensitive underarms.	1
Awesome	1
Everything that I loved in a thinner cookie which I'd wanted for years.  Now only if they had it for the lemon.	1
I LOVE these cookies! Nice addition to the Oreo lineup.	1
Two words that do not go together...'Oreo' and 'Sophisticated'.  Until now!  This is the cookie to have with your coffee, Oreos aren't just for milk anymore. The taste is exactly the same as the full size version, like I needed a reason to savor both, heh heh. If you cringe at the Double Stuf Oreos, you'll be delighted to know that the filling is just as slimmed down as the cookie. I expected them to have a lot more crunch, but any difference is negligible. Four cookies are 140 calories, 60 fat calories, but who's counting? There are 160 in three regular Golden Oreos, with the same 60 fat calories. About 40 per package. The only stat you might care about is that they do contain high fructose corn syrup. The packaging has that familiar lift-up-easy-close, important on humid days.  And for the kid in you, yes, you can still twist them apart to get to the creamy filling.	1
This is some of my favorite deodorant I've ever used. It's just so smooth and silky. I never get white stains with this, and gel deodorant just doesn't seem to work as well. The smell is amazing too.	1
Love this product. Great price!	1
Smells great and works really well. I love it.	1
Best product ever! I have not found any other primer thar works like this one does!	1
SMELLS GOOD.	1
This is a great smelling body wash.  It has a color in it but it doesn't, as I've seen in other reviews, stain.  This is a very thick liquid. It bubbles up nicely and keeps up a nice lather. The bubbles are colored. The smell stays during the whole bath and lingers on your skin for a while.  Enjoy.	1
Smells awesome.  Scent lasts a long time.  Great price in Pantry.	1
I have used Suave for a long time and I will continue with the hot flashes I don't sweat as much.	1
fine	1
It's deodorant, what can I say, smells good.	1
great scent	1
LOVE SECRET	1
Love it!  It works very well as a deodorant without a strong lingering fragrance.	1
Inexpensive, effective and smells great!	1
A fav	1
Daughter loves this product, says it works GREAT, and smells divine! Highly recommended! Great value!!	1
no problems.. works as well as you could expect a deodorant  to work.. I am stepping down from using Mitchums for years .. and find this works quite well.	1
as described	1
My go to deodorant. The scent is light and fresh and the coverage is great.	1
I love these they smell great	1
Love this deodorant. The small is awesome! This was a 2 pack so that was nice. They have lasted a while. I am always careful thought, they do leave white marks on your clothes. I always put on AFTER I am dressed and I have no issues.	1
Its just deodorant	-1
Prefer the baby powder scent, but this works just fine.	1
Great value for the double pack! Will be purchasing again when I run out!	1
I've been using this for about a year, and it works just fine for me. I really enjoy the scent.	1
NICE	1
Idk if it's just a bad mix for my body chemistry,  but this did nothing for me. Made me smell like that trying to cover up armpit funk smell with perfume or something.  It's too scented.	-1
This is a wonderful scent, appropriate for year round use. Does a fantastic job of preventing wetness and odor. Always a great price with Suave.	1
It smells great! Works well even when you're really sweaty.	1
This brand did not work well for me. Returning to my previous brand instead.	-1
Love Suave products	1
Works great, smells great.	1
This used to be my favorite stick deodorant but I couldn't find it often at stores.  Was very glad to find it on Amazon.  Still the same great fragrance and ingredients in it.  I hope it stays in stock on Amazon so it won't be so hard to find.  I am very pleased with my purchase.	1
Works good.	1
It has a nice smell and it works	1
Over twenty years	1
Love the smell and the cost is great for 2 deodorants.  Nice when you are trying to save a few dollars here and there.  Suave is a great brand.	1
Good	1
Smells great and works all day	1
Love the scent. The formula could be a little better. Doesn't last all day, which is unfortunate.	1
Very nice smelling deodorant. It smells exactly like sweet pea (and like the sweet pea lotion they have at bath and body works!) It lasts you quite some time too. Plus it comes in a pack of 2 so you are getting a great deal!	1
It's my favorite scent deodorant and I usually have trouble finding it at the store. Good price and size!	1
great	1
Idk what I would do without this. I sweat profusely and this deo never lets me down	1
I love suave products. I think they work just as well as more expensive products. Great product, great price, ,& fast shipping/.	1
Smells very nice. Not too flowery or strong. Not a scent I can find in stores. Works well. Love that it comes in bulk.	1
Works great, smells nice	1
Smells very sweet and feminine which is fine, but it can overwhelm a small area right after you apply it....say an elevator or car within a half hour after your shower. My husband swears he can smell the Sweet Pea & Violet coming down a hall before he sees me.  On the plus side, like the other, more subtley scented, Suave antiperspirant varieties, this one does work well for my needs. I don't worry about sweat odor or marks when I'm working horses, doing barn chores or just playing with the dogs in the Texas sun. And this comes in a two pack via Prime Pantry so I never run out.	1
classic scent and reliable protection.	1
I bought this from the amazon pantry the price was great and I will definitely be adding this to my monthly amazon prime pantry shopping cart.	1
good to use nice scents	1
I usually use crystal deodorant, but I still trust the "normal" stuff a bit more when I know I'm going to be in a particularly sweat-inducing situation. This deodorant has a very pleasant, gentle scent. It's floral, but sweet like candy, not overpowering like old lady perfume. I've only been using one stick so far, but it has been keeping me dry and stink-free.	1
This is a great scent.  And Suave makes a body wash with the same scent, so if you're trying to not have clashing scents, that's a good way to go.  It keeps me stink-free and relatively dry-ish for about 14 hours, so I gotta call BS on the 24 hour part...	1
Favorite.	1
My favorite deodorant!	1
Good value and fresh product.  Gave one to each of my pre-teens who loved the fragrance and that was that.  Very good price and saved me a trip to Target where I would have spent $200 even though all I MEANT to buy was deodorant.	1
I've always depended on Suave deoderant and antiperspirant for dependable yet cost effective coverage.	1
The item was as advertised in the description, arrived in the correct time frame and was shipped well and all in tact upon delivery. When the price is right, Amazon is my number one go to for almost everything. The Prime membership is (a lifesaver sometimes even) well worth it and the fact you can keep things in the cart until the price drops makes it a huge shopping tool.  Thank you.	1
It love the way this one smells. It does what it promises.	1
Nice product for a good price point. Shipped and arrived fast.	1
Like the product.  Good deodorant.	1
Nice	1
Item as described	1
Works well throughout the day.  The fragrance is light and lovely.  The pricing is much better than comparable brands.	1
Smells good, not really invisible and will crease under your arms if you put even a little too much.	1
I love the smell, and this size bottle is larger than the grocery store for the same amount of money.  I do not stay as dry with this as I do with another brand, but since I love the smell, I will use it on the days when I plan to stay home.  That way if I do work up a sweat no-body will see it but me and my kids.	1
Been using this stuff for years now. Never have any problems with it! Works great all day...the sweet pea is a nice change!!! The price for two,is FABULOUS!!!	1
I'm super pleased with this purchase for the following reasons:  1. It works - I don't stink 2. The scent - It smells wonderful and I can't always find this scent in the stores 3. The price - Great value for 2 - better than the stores 4. Invisible - It doesn't leave  residue on my clothes	1
very easy to fix and keeps well	1
Smells wonderful, works great, will buy again.	1
GREAT	1
I bought this product to help get my daughter used to using deodorant, same as my mother did with me. I liked that I was able to buy a 2 pack so that we both would get one at a better price. This product as a great smell to it and it does the job at preventing B.O and my daughter likes using it as well. I would highly recommend this brand and this product for the value and that it works.	1
As described	1
only one I will use	1
This is a great Antiperspirant.  I love it.	1
great thanks.  love the scent	1
ok	1
Nice smells and lots of suds.	1
Great product!	1
This is one of my husbands favorite body washes and to get a coupon to purchase and get the buy 5 free shipping deal was awesome. Nothing better than a nice smelling man.	1
If Thin Mints and Oreos had a "child" these would be it! It's a rather strong mint flavor that reminds me of a Thin Mint. The texture, however, is nothing like a Thin Mint. The outer cookies seem to be the regular Oreo cookies but the inside is all mint. These cookies are rather thin which can be a good or bad thing. It's good because you can easily pop a whole one in your mouth, it's bad because it's easy to eat a lot them!  I'm giving these a 5 star rating for a couple of reasons. They tasted fresh to me and they tasted really good. All of the cookies came unbroken and I was happy with the packaging so I guess I have to thank Amazon Prime Pantry for that! I actually prefer these to regular Oreos and I think they are quite enjoyable.	1
I like Oreos. Who doesn't?  Then I tried the vanilla AKA 'Golden' Thins. My-O-My! Slim and sophisticated. I tried the vanilla first because I'm one of those rare humans that turns her nose up at a Thin Mint Girl Scout cookie. Bought the mint for others.  Now the question is, do I confess that I actually have a package, or snarf them all down and hide until my breath no longer has a telltale minty-chocolate thing going on?  Although the taste is identical to the full size version, there is some kind of mystical magic going on that even a vanilla lover will swoon over these. Any extra crispness is negligible, so it isn't that. Is it the ratio of filling? Can't be certain, as both cookie and filling appear to be slimmed down by the same percent. By the way, fans of 'Double Stuf' Oreos will need to untwist and re-engineer their cookies, which despite the elegant exterior, is still possible with the Thin Oreo.  Who knows, but who cares! These are absolutely delicious! Refined enough to rest alongside the demitasse, casual enough to adorn a scoop of chocolate mint ice cream. Four cookies are 140 calories, 50 fat calories, but who's counting? There are 180 in three regular Mint Oreos, with 80 fat calories. In a perfect world they wouldn't contain high fructose, but natural sugar is the first ingredient.	1
These are great!	1
Unfortunately, these are soooooo very delicious, I can tell the once a year door to door sales women to move along, I have my mint cookie solution. I always hated oreos because of the disgusting cream filling, these have just a touch of the goo, you can taste the dark chocolate cookie so very well. Mmmmm mint and chocolate...	1
Good product	1
Taste like Girl Scout thin mint cookies. Yummy?	1
very tasty	1
pretty tasty when stoned	1
best way to have an oreo	1
They taste just like thin mints!	1
Hard to find in stores.  The Oreo Thins sandwich cookies are, to my taste buds, better than the larger originals.  This is true of the regular and the mint varieties.	1
Delicious!	1
yummm!	1
Great cookie. Mint goes so well with chocolate.	1
bigger bag please!	1
I don't like a lot of filling but these were really lite on filling.  I guess I'll stick with the regular.	-1
Love the flavor of these!!	1
I wasn't terribly excited about these when ordering them..I just needed to fill up a pantry box. But when they arrived, I found them to be so addictive! Better than the regular mint Oreo. The thin cookies is a more elegant take on the originals... if that makes sense. Just the right amount of mint to cookie ratio. Ended up ordering another pack as soon as our first pack ran out.	1
My daughters love these thin mint oreo cookies.  If they love them then they are a hit.	1
Yummy cookies	1
They didn't last long in my house.	1
Yum!  Great cookies, they are quite thin as indicated.  They went well with my morning coffee!	1
I don't like regular oreos, but these were delicious!	1
Afternoon treat.  Yummy	1
love it	1
fine	1
These are really good and satisfy our sweet tooth!	1
So tasty!  Can eat them without dipping.	1
these to me are better then Girl Scout cookies	1
Amazing, we keep buying this product.	1
taste great	1
crispy and minty perfect for dunking in coffee	1
Yuck. These were like a sad version of thin mints.	-1
My whole family loves these thin cookies.  Just the right amount of mint.	1
Tasty/	1
There is a reason I don't go down the cookie isle..... this would be one of the reasons. I hadn't even heard of these but was trying to fill up my prime box.... HAVE MERCY I DID NOT NEED TO FIND THESE!!! Yummy, yum, yum!	1
Perfect combo of flavors	1
So glad to find the mint Oreos in the snack packs  The flavor is so good and I love the portion control for me and the east to pack in lunch bags for grandchildren.  Will buy this snack again.	1
I'm not into Oreo's really, but when I saw the thin mint ones I had to try.  The thinness takes these to a whole new level.  One of the things I didn't like about Oreo's was the cookies were thick and then you were getting two thick pieces, just too much cookie, and the filling just wasn't all that good.  The thin cookies are crispy, not soggy and thick and the filling is a nice minty flavor.  Taste like a thin mint candy.  These are so good, they are addicting.  Great by themselves, but as a pie crust, wow.  I wish now I'd never found them, they are just too good.	1
What a find.  I love Oreos.  Have loved them since I was little.  Delicious, crunchy and taste like the same Oreo cookies with less calories. I could still dunk them in milk and enjoy that cream center.  Will purchase again and recommend to others.	1
very good	1
Horrible after taste!	-1
Great taste of Oreo will mint....fantastic	1
these are so good, i cannot buy them anymore. they are addictive and i can scarf the entire package.  so much better than those you buy once a year.... from girls in green.  :)	1
These are my favorite Oreos. Bold mint flavor and great cookie to filling ratio.	1
great	1
Oh my gosh, I was so skeptical of these Oreo Thin cookies.  I put off trying them for a long time.  I finally bit the bullet and got a package.  This has two of my favorite things - oreos and mint flavor.  I'm actually a huge fan of this thin cookie version.  These are a great option if you aren't a fan of the bigger oreos.  Just enough flavor.  The cookie part is thin as is the middle filling.  It's just a greater, lighter version.  You really expect that the flavor might be dull due to the thinness but it's not ... I promise.  It's perfect.  If you love the girl scout cookies - this is a great alternative!	1
I like these....  but not as much as the regular ones.  Will probably not buy again - but the flavor is there.	1
Love them	1
I was honestly expecting these to be a little more like Thin Mints (a'la Girl Scout Cookies) but I should have realized...this is for the Oreo fans who A. like that minty center; B. Prefer more of the outer cookie layer than the inner filling layer; C. enjoy thin mints but prefer the crunchiness of an Oreo...  Though I was a little disappointed when I realized what I had ordered, I still enjoyed these very very much (maybe a little too much). The rest of my family also liked them a whole bunch, so much so that they didn't last more than an hour once they were opened! That's a testament to how delicious they are (but still no substitute for my favorite, of course).	1
Thin are as good as regular. Like both it's hard moderate the intake; the "just one more" voice speaks so much louder than the "limit yourself" voice! Sooooo gooooo! I'm salivating as I type!!	1
Terrible Oreo	-1
They were good.	1
Fresh products.  Very satisfied.  I recommend Amazon Pantry.  Shipping box is very durable.  All goods were neatly packaged and arrived safely and undamaged.	1
Nom nom nom.	1
I originally saw these at the store... and passed...  While I was ordering a few odd snacks for a party, I added these... Wow... they FLEW!!  Yum.  Yeah.  Extra thin, crispy chocolate oreo cookies and a very thin smear of green mint filling. Not too sweet, just the right minty.  I wish they would have skipped the green dye... but then Oreos are NOT health food...  still... Nabisco! drop the dye.  :)  If you're on the fence, TRY them.. If you're into mint chocolate thin cookies, you'll be back.  They arrived quickly (I have prime) and in great condition.  Also, I do NOT receive compensation for any of reviews, ever.  I update if new info would help.. .but honestly, these are just plain good.	1
I bought several snacks for my son who lives in the dorm and would like the convenience of a snack without having to leave and go by a snack for those evening cravings. They are classic snacks and a great option for sending a food care package to loved ones. I love prime pantry for purchasing a variety of products with a flat shipping rate that is always super fast!!!	1
Good cookies for mint lovers.	1
It's Oreo,it's fabulous! Thin mint cookies are the best of all their snack food products.	1
These are sooo good!!!  I know they are "thins", but I wish Nabisco would make a full size version of these!	1
I actually don't care for regular Oreos, and I think it's because of the cookie to creme ratio. These are perfect.	1
All the Oreo flavor with a mega dose of crunch.  My new fav.	1
Taste as good as girl scout thin mints.	1
Love	1
I'll admit it now...I'm not a huge fan of Oreos. Okay I said it, but these have totally redeemed Oreos in my book. I bought these as a gift for someone else, but I have purchased some for myself. I don't really like the creamy center that Oreos have, and find myself peeling it off just to eat the crunchy chocolate cookie. These are perfect because you get a hint of mint, which I like, and a stronger chocolate taste, which I like more. They seem so much crunchier than regular Oreos, but I think that's because there is less cream. Either way I love these although I do love GS cookies more. They're similar but the cookie is a bit different in texture. Plus the GS cookies are coated in delicious chocolate.	1
Love these! They are the best and have the perfect mint flavor!	1
If you're a fan of mint do yourself a favor and snag some of these. The flavor is out of this world good. Pair these up with some Junior mint cocoa.	1
WARNING:  Once you try these, you WILL be addicted.  They are light and delicious! Yummy!	1
AS EXPECTED	1
Love these.  They are better than Girl Scouts Thin Mints.  And that is saying a lot for me!	1
So much like the Girl Scout's thin mints, but you can buy them all year round!	1
I love these, and so glad they came ut with the thins. The regular are too much and these are perfect.	1
Delicious	1
Someone said these taste like the mint cookies sold by troups . Perfect description without the melting outer chocolate . We will still support the fundraising efforts of the kids but in between these are very close in taste . Saw these in magazine but not in the stores . Easy open/ resealable package . Very fresh through prime pantry .  Very thin cookies which we like to have with tea /coffee . Very nice little cookie .	1
These have the G.S. Thin Mints beat hands down. The thin Oreos are just right!  Not a fan of the Double Stuff!  I would like to say The new lemon Oreo and think they could make the  change to thin as well!	1
Only cookie we buy these days.	1
Tasted great, arrived in tact.	1
great	1
Excellent product, great taste!	1
Lovv these and so hard to find, plus greT price!	1
Why are these so addictive! Mine come crushed most of the time but I don't mind anymore. I just dump some in a cup with milk! I only get these when I have prime pantry credits to use though! I just get them from the store usually so the cookies are intact.  I love the ration between cookie and cream! The cookies are thin and seem to be crispier than the original. Plus I am not a big fan of the cream so I prefer the thins compared to the original oreos.	1
I like these way better than regular Oreos. They are delicate like thin crackers but sooooo good. Where have these been all my life? I also love that I can eat 4 of these for the same amount of calories as 2 regular Oreos. Don't try these if you don't want to be addicted!	1
These are the best variation of the Oreo cookie I have tasted so far. They are consistently delicious and so crunchy! They remind me very much of the Girl Scouts Thin Mints. Yumyumyumyumyum!!!!	1
family can't get enough of these little treats.	1
These are really good, for the kid in all of us, and they are not overly minty.  I love them.	1
These are a new twist, on the "new twist" of Oreo Thins! These thins have a yummy mint flavored center and it makes these wafer thin cookies very hard to resist!  The mint taste I find, is "just right". Not too minty and sweet, but just plain delicious! They remind me of those mint chocolate thins, only these are crunchy.  These cookies hold together very well despite being wafer thin, and can even be dunked in tea or coffee if you so please :) Everyone in the family really enjoys these Oreo Mint Thins and we will certainly be buying again!	1
Great as expected	1
These are dangerous!!! They are soooo good!! I can eat a whole box. Why didn't the come out with these sonner?!	1
MMMMM so GOOD!!	1
A family favorite! lower calorie!	1
I left my other half alone with this....I had to pry it out of his grip...could not find it in local stores.  Gotta love amazon.  They do not feel so heavy when you eat it.  Reminds me of the 100 calorie packs, except you need to portion control it yourself.	1
Bag could have another row! small bag.	1
I wish I'd never found out about these. Ordinarily, I'm not an Oreo fan but these are irresistible. It seems as if 1 serving = 1 bag...only the strong-willed should try them.	1
Too sweet for me but my father gladly finished the pack for me in just a few days. Lol so if you like rich sweets you will love these!	1
These are so good.  They are really great covered in chocolate and decorated for special occasions.	1
These are delicious!  Oreo's answer to the mint Girl Scout cookie.	1
Awesome way to be on a diet and have your cookies too!	1
Never really liked Oreo filling, but these are amazing. They're like 'thin mints' but better.  Thin crispy and minty.	1
oh my awesome reminds me of the thin mints sold by girl scouts loved them	1
tooooooooooo good	1
I am not big on sweets but I do like a little something every once and a while. These are great. Just like regular Oreos but thinner. They are easier to eat and just enough sweet for me. The mint flavor is good on these. I love how easily they break when I bite into them but they are still sturdy enough to open up and eat the filling if that is your method. Good stuff from Oreo.	1
If you like the cookie part these are great, you can taste the mint but it isn't overpowering.  Yummy!!	1
Yummy!  Crisp and light.  Tastes like Girl Scout Thin Mints.	1
I had a hard time not eating the whole package.  These were excellent!	1
Didn't think original Oreos could be topped but these are just delicious--- crispy and are flavored with  just the right amount of mint.	1
Really tasty. The mint flavor is absolutely perfect. These are a pretty good alternative to the Girl Scouts "Thin Mint" cookies. Granted they are not the same style, but they deliver the same taste.  I recommend putting them in the freezer to make them nice a crispy!	1
Thin mints are better.  These are cute	1
Delicious.	1
A new favorite!  The only downfall to this product is that you can eat the whole package without even noticing.  They are the perfect thin cookie.  Soo good!  A welcome addition to the Oreo family and to my pantry.  Well done Nabisco!	1
Yum Yum Yum	1
Get the mascara off. Good make-up remover	1
It's a great fave lotion for the winter. My skin is neither dry nor oily all the time. Depending on the season (summer oily, winter dry) I have to switch between facial creams.	1
good	1
Great product	1
So soft.  Perfect	1
Value priced, excellent moisturizing!  Will definitely buy again. Results every bit as good as much higher priced products!	1
I really like this cream. I originally got it because I have Fibromyalgia, and I was going to try the Guaifenesin (aka Mucinex) protocol, which is where you take Guaifenesin daily, but salicates infer with the Guaifenesin, so I was instructed to get salicate free cosmetics and personal care items like shampoo, conditioner, body wash, toothpaste, and face cream.  And this cream was on the OK list to get, which is why I ordered it.  I really like this cream is very light, and doesn't upset my adult acne.	1
Still waitiing for it	-1
excellent as always	1
It's a nice face lotion that doesn't sit oily or greasy, and also does not irritate my sensitive skin. The smell is a little weird, but not bad overall. I also like that it comes in a jar versus a bottle with a pump, so you can use every last bit.	1
My youngest daughter (14) has very dry and sensitive skin. During the winter months her skin is very dry. This has been one of the few face lotions that have helped with her dryness and does not cause a burning/itching sensation.  Very happy with the product.	1
The best hydrating cream. My skin looks great and hydrated throughout the day. My grandma used this and barely had any lines at 90 and since I started using it several years ago my skin has improved and fine lines disappeared. 56 and not a wrinkle. Will never use anything else again	1
These are the best Oreos I've ever had, mostly I think because they have a bit more crunch and the ratios of cookie to creme are amazing! Seriously the packaged cookie I've been waiting for!	1
Wow, these are awesome!  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because you get a lot less for your money!	1
Always a winner in our house.	1
Terrible cookies, much too sweet. Original much better	-1
There thin and that is how I like em just a bite or two and I'm good to go.	1
who dose not like oreos	1
They were very good. I think I like them more than the original cookie	1
How come I did not discover these earlier in my life!	1
Great Product.	1
tasty	1
Best cookie evahhhhh	1
Ordered 5, 4 came in perfect, 1 came with half of the cookies 'demolished', but who cares. How can you not love this ppl.	1
Love the thins! Perfect for a small sweet snack!	1
My fav indulgence. Arriba on time  packed with good protection. I have never recieved a box with any broken cookies.	1
Bought as a gift via The pantry, arrived well within expiration, packaged well and were very fresh.	1
I love all the varieties of the thin Oreos. It's great for a snack and doesn't have too much of the Creme in the middle. The mint ones taste like thin mints, yum !	1
I gave these new Oreo cookies four stars because the thinness slightly changes the flavor that you normally get with an Oreo cookie; but they are still a tasty treat.	1
I actually really like the thin ones !	1
perfect!	1
Love the new thin cookies	1
I love these thin cookies better than the regular cookies.	1
Oreo thins are the best!	1
I love these. Not too sweet.	1
Great Taste.	1
Yummy--Oreos!	1
Oreo thins are the best	1
Crumbled upon arrival	-1
BETTER THEN THE REGULAR OREO'S LESS FILLING AND MORE COOKIE YUMMY	1
Prefer the "thins" - not too much cookie.	1
Tried these on a lark..and found I LOVED them even better than the regular ones... the only downside is that the package is so darned small...you don't get a lot of them, and you tend to eat more of them because they are thin... Would have went with five stars if they came in a larger package.  bottom line:  excellent but not enough of them	1
Perfect snack!	1
My husband loves Oreos, and GASP, I do not. I got these as I figured they would be better to smash up and put into ice cream. Well I actually like these! Win-Win!	1
Yummy cookies	1
I love these cookies!  Just perfect for a quick snack and so crunchy and good.	1
Great taste small pack though.	1
Awesome, awesome, awesome	1
liked it	1
love these...did not come crumbled from transit	1
kids love them	1
Nice	1
TASTY THIN AND PERFECT BALANCE!	1
Afternoon treat.  Yummy	1
Much better than double stuff in my opinion.	1
We seem to go through the bags of the things cookies faster than the regular ones.	1
aaaa	1
Love these cookies!  Better now that they're thinner.	1
Same as OREO minis. Too much chocolate, very lil stuffing. Flavor lost in translation. Not cool.	-1
I really liked these! This was a great idea!	1
Letdown, no taste, very  thin	-1
If you're like me and you don't care much for the icing in the middle but you can't do completely without the icing because otherwise they wouldn't be oreos, these are for you!	1
wanted to try the thins out because I'm not much the creme center of oreos and these are great	1
I didn't think the shape would change the taste much, but I love these!	1
I like the thin ones.	1
One of the cookies we like the most!.	1
should have gotten the double stuff	1
Excellent!	1
Oreo thins ARE SO MUCH BETTER than regular Oreos!!  I am obsessed with these and if you are trying to cut calories it helps a lot that these are so much thinner and have less filling than the regular Oreos. My daughter loves them too!	1
good	1
So sinfully better than double stuff!	1
Always loved this cookie.	1
Love these because they have a lot less frosting. Works out better in recipes calling for crushed oreo cookies.	1
I was afraid that sending all came crumbling because their are THINS, but their come pefect... great cookies, not too sweet, just the perfect flavor balance.	1
My way of letting the kids have their favorite cookie Oreos with half the fact and calories.	1
Finally an Oreo that I can love. Love the thins, getting harder to find in my local grocery, so I'm ordering from Prime.	1
Oreo cookie - not filling - lovers rejoice!  These are the cookies for you.  Oreo Thins Chocolate Sandwich Cookies are seriously my favorite cookies of all time.  While I love normal Oreos, I was never a big fan of eating the filling.  However, I love the cookies themselves, and often found myself scraping the filling off to the side.  The Oreo Thins cookies are thin, crisp, and so full of flavor, but in a smaller more waist friendly size.  The best part - there's less filling in there so I can enjoy the cookie without having to eat tons of frosting.  I love the texture of these tasty treats and the flavor is still absolutely delicious.  I have to watch out...these are like potato chips - can't just eat one!	1
For those of us who are Team Wafer, and who have been known to scrape most of the frosting off our Oreos and throw it away, this is the perfect Oreo.	1
OMG this is thin and yummy and helps you not eat the entire box.	1
These are my favorite kind of cookies!	1
Delicious!	1
I have always loved oreo cookies, whether they be the original or the golden ones. The Oreo thins are two steps above the original Oreo cookies. They are absolutely delicious! We actually finished the bag in one sitting because it was so addictive. It doesn't feel like too much chocolate and it doesn't feel like too much cream. It is just the right amount and they're less messy to eat (in my opinion). I will definitely be purchasing some more Oreo thins if they're ever on sale again! If you're an Oreo lover, you will absolutely love these!	1
Did not like this new product - we ill not order again. I guess I like the filling way too much to let it go.	-1
My favorite, especially crumbled up in ice cream!	1
nice and thin, shame they didn't make these sooner.	1
Oreos are always delicious. Can't go wrong. When they say thin.....they are thin. Only problem ordering these online is they get broken easily because the mailman does not always handle with care.	1
Love thins and less cream filling.	1
I bought several snacks for my son who lives in the dorm and would like the convenience of a snack without having to leave and go by a snack for those evening cravings. They are classic snacks and a great option for sending a food care package to loved ones. I love prime pantry for purchasing a variety of products with a flat shipping rate that is always super fast!!!	1
Made in Mexico, Same price for less amount. Shame on Nabisco, The USA supported you for so long then you just leave us high and dry.	-1
Good product. Good transaction.	1
Order these, and you will wonder why it took them so long to come up with Thin Oreos! They are perfectly bite-sized, and completely addicting! The proportion of cookie to cream is perfect!	1
Food	1
These are terrific.  Glad gave them a trym	1
Great....perhaps too delicious as they were inhaled by our children!	1
Love	1
The crunch and ratio on these is awesome!  Try them now!	1
This was yummy, I bought this as part of my prime pantry box.	1
Addictive, delicious	1
When they take old classics and change them up, I always worry that they're messing with a good thing. There's a million different kinds of Oreos out there now, it's so overwhelming. I gave these a shot from Prime Pantry and I have to say, they're better than the original! You can eat them like chips! Just the right proportion of cream to cookie!	1
Sorry, mmmmm,  hard to type with my mouth full of these wonderful Oreos  !!	1
those are better than originals, maybe someone may find disappointed by how thin the filling is, but not from me!	1
Thin is in!!!  Only problem, is eating the whole bag in one sitting!!!!!  AWESOME!!!! A+++++	1
These are addicting. I don't know how they figured out how To make Oreos even better but they did	1
Loved these!  Perfect small bite of chocolate and icing!	1
Used for colonoscopy and would NEVER use for any other reason. Massive stomach pains. So many better more nature ways to go!	-1
Can we just have one size of toilet paper and paper towels?  I am tired of trying to figure out 6=12, 8=10, 12=24, etc, can we just have 1=1. This toilet paper also leaves a lot of lint.	-1
This was unusable due to being saturated by juice from open fruit cups in shipping container. Don't know where else to put this.	-1
I have used Charmin Ultra (strong or soft) for years. Recently I have found them to be less strong and less soft compared to the other leading brands and I think I have found the reason. Charmin no longer compares itself to other leading brands, instead it is putting itself up again bargain brands, as you can read in these ads. Well, that's fine for them. If you're only reaching for the lowest step, there's no chance of failing. Personally I'm going back to looking for TP that is soft and strong, and not the one with the biggest center on the market.	-1
I like Charmin and with this you get what you pay for unlike my other experiences with Cottonelle that are a bit light. However, this is too expensive to buy online. There are plenty of sales and this was a desperate buy when I didn't have the time. I won't do this again unless it proves to be more economical.	-1
great deal	-1
This is not the same Charmin Ultra Strong you get in a store (i.e. Target, where I usually buy it). It is thinner, and not strong at all. I suspect it may be a knock off. I ordered it twice to verify my suspicions, and it was the same cheap stuff both times. Looks like Charmin on the outside, definitely not Charmin on the inside. DO NOT BUY.	-1
THESE ARE NOT POST-ITS!  I was fooled into thinking I was getting an amazing deal on post-its, and now I'm stuck with index cards that have been cut in half (I won't ever have a purpose for these!).  I guess reading is a skill... that was my fault so still 2 stars BUT- if you actually DO need half sized index cards, I'm 110% sure it would be cheaper to just buy regular sized ones and cut them yourself, but, as I always say... you do you.	-1
Cheaply made but good price. I wouldn't order it again.	-1
Nothing special, and the purple color is light purple.	-1
This doesn't dissolve..put it in a bowl overnight to see..YET I've found a great way to use it. IN THE DISHWASHER DISPENSER. I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT AND HAVE THE 'CHEAP" DISHWASHER. I DON'T USE IT OFTEN; USING THE CRYSTALS REALLY HELPS CLEAN where the water drains. Laundry..cleaning..it just won't dissolve....even putting it in a drain overnight....	-1
the crystals are supposed to dissolve in water. they don't	-1
This is a strange product. I cannot get these crystals to dissolve in water , which is the whole reason I bought it. But if any fall and scatter on the floor (which they will) and anything falls on them, they will bleach on contact despite being dry. Then I took a sweater out of the washer and there were intact bleach crystals clinging to it, even though I didn't add bleach to that washload  the garment must've picked up some crystals from the floor or somewhere! The crystals never dissolved. You need to be super careful with liquid bleach but I would say the same thing about this product.	-1
I have a front loader: I pretreated the stains, put the crystals in and the stains did not come out.	-1
Within days the grass started growing a white mold on it.  My cats puked a lot after eating the grass and it started to brown within 2 weeks.  Sad as I had high hopes for this.	-1
It did grow just as it said it would. Unfortunately my cats just weren't interested in so it went into the trash. I am always looking for new safe toys/treats for my spoiled cat babies.	-1
We had high hopes that this product would help a certain member of the family with a preponderance of flatulence. Unfortunately, there was no noticeable difference. It may as well have been placebos.	-1
Don't knoe	-1
Not good if you have EBS. Don't use this if you have it.	-1
Price was good so I tried these. Problem is that your nose has to be directed an inch from it to smell it. Not good as a room air freshener. I even put it by the window and you still can't smell it in the room. Not a good freshener for the home. Maybe for a car which is enclosed and smaller.	-1
they lasted approx 35 minutes.	-1
I didn't find the scent anywhere near strong enough.  I placed 3 completely open in one bathroom in order to detect a fragrance.	-1
Smells terrible	-1
These don't smell very strong & they don't stick. Will not be buying these again.	-1
It fell off all the time. Put it on my garbage cans. Didn't notice when the first or second fell in. Got maybe two weeks of use.	-1
I got a spider bite on the side of my waist. It oozed and itched for almost a month before looking at what I could use to help with the itch. The area kept growing in size and alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, clay mask, antibiotic ointment wasn't helping.  This didn't help either. It was like rubbing on white, thick lotion. Didn't help the itch or redness.  I kept taking my allergy pills (Zertec) and kept washing the bite site and keeping it covered with a thin, airy gauze sponge and after another month it finally started to heal.	-1
This did not do a thing.	-1
This is a very potent smelling melt. It is very sweet and flowery, but also has an almost chemical smell to it. Sadly it reminds me of strong air freshener or toilet cleaner, and I just don't like it. A small amount produces a lot of scent, and after about a half hour of being in a bedroom with it I had to get rid of it as it had given me a headache. Maybe others will love it - scents are such an individual thing. But this one is definitely not for me.	-1
The cap broke on the first time, product seems nice.	-1
Looking for a massage oil that is not sticky. Maybe since this one doubles as a lubricant?  Anyway, it gums up really bad seconds after you apply it- even if your just spreading/applying it.  Not to mention the stickiness makes it itchy and necessary to shower, soap required.	-1
smells very strong.  Its actually a little overpowering.	-1
not fond of this no sugar version.  Like the original	-1
Doesn't taste very good :( 10,000x worse tasting than their NON zero flavors. I'm fine with diet sodas and lightly flavored drinks like citrus S. Pellegrino, but this stuff is pretty nasty. The orange, sunrise or "rise" flavor is just as disgusting.	-1
had a funny aftertaste	-1
Not for mr, tastes awful	-1
Taking in mind that I am used to the non-zero XXX Vitamin Water, I have to say this is a poor substitute. I tend not to drink diet beverages as I don't drink soda and to be perfectly honest, I didn't realize I had ordered the zero version but I figured I would give it a try. The two other zero versions I tried (power-c and essential) are very close to their full-calorie counterparts (obviously not identical, but enough that it is hardly noticeable). I must say this zero version tasted a bit sour to me and essentially tasted like I was drinking regular XXX about a year after it's sell-by date.	-1
I bought this to have to use when I have an occasional breakout. So far all it's done is make the breakout much worse vs. not using anything at all, and it dries my skin out even if I use moisturizer afterwards.	-1
This was the wrong one	-1
Doesn't taste very good :( 10,000x worse tasting than their NON zero flavors. I'm fine with diet sodas and lightly flavored drinks like citrus S. Pellegrino, but this stuff is pretty nasty. The xxx flavor is just as disgusting.	-1
Works fine as a massage gel but really isn't fit for play.  Lacks sufficient lubricant properties and quickly dissipates.  Has an odd scent that I find offputting.  The warming sensation is barely noticeable when compared with other oils or lubricants.	-1
Dopes not warm the skin and dries up quickly. Not good for massage.	-1
too small	-1
Leaves hair sticky.	-1
Color is very faded.	-1
Ick.  The flavor is really strange.  They taste like overripe fruit to me.  I will go back to cherry Ludens for when I just have a dry throat, and Halls when I have a cold.  Obviously, taste buds vary, so the only way to know is to try them.  I gave mine to kids in the children's room of the library where I work.  They mostly didn't like them either.	-1
I was excited to try a new flavor of the Luden's drops, as I really like the cherry kind.  But these just tasted.... gross.  I couldn't even finish the whole drop without spitting it out.  I will stick to the cherry ones from now on.	-1
Didn't realize it was carbonated. Horrible taste.	-1
smashed!!!!	-1
Complete deception - photo shows multiple packs! This only includes one package.	-1
Not the taste I expected.	-1
These are awful. Not consumable.	-1
meh	-1
its way too sweet	-1
Cheap for a reason.  The flavor and texture was underwhelming for sure.  The cuts of meat were fine with nothing with excessive fat or connective tissue, but it was just very weak in flavor.  Brought on a camping trip, and no one really enjoyed this brand.  It was a dud, which is a shame because we saw Sweet Baby Ray's and through it would be the best like the sauce.	-1
This wasn't very good beef jerky. Too sweet, too soft and chewy. To each their own, but I wasn't a fan.	-1
never knew about non-irradiated herbs! I do now. I don't like the smell. We grow basil in the summer. Lots of it. I make pesto and use loads of basil on pizza and cooking etc. I can't understand how the smell is in this huge bag. It's cheap, and I should have known better. I listened to the reviews and they are not right as far as I am concerned. I will just throw whole bag away. Would never buy any again.	-1
Creamy! Even velvety! But bland. Decent base to which you can add your own seasonings and other ingredients. I tried fresh dill--no. Tried fresh jalapeno peppers--better. Next I will try adding fresh garlic and sweet red peppers; maybe bacon or ham. Number one ingredient is water. I hoped for more taste of corn.	-1
I didn.t care for this.	-1
No dumplings, noodles! Nasty yellow fatty stuff and mushy veggies.	-1
not my favorite. expensive for size, in my opinion	-1
Meh. Totally underwhelming. I was expecting a big bold flavor and all there is to find here is sweet pork. Too sweet for my tastes with no other real spice or flavorings to back it up. I love sweet and hot, but just sweet portk? No thanks. A seemingly really small bag for the price too. I'll pass next time.	-1
I was really hoping this soup would be creamy and substantial and looked forward to eating it for the first time. Sadly, it is watery and lacking in flavor. However, it is low sodium and organic, which are two positives. I was terribly disappointed.	-1
Doesn't taste very good	-1
Not a very good flavor pack. The flavors were very weak, except for the banana one.	-1
didn't work in our K20	-1
Didn't help hubbies dry scalp. But every one is different and it might work for others.	-1
In the past I have used scent boosters that I could still smell after the laundry was hanging up in the closet and I liked that. I decided to give these pods a try in hopes I would get the same affect, sadly I did not.  They did dissolve in the wash whether I was using hot, warm, or cold water. Out of the wash the clothes smelled amazing. Once out of the dryer the clothes barely held on to the laundry booster scent. The scent out of the dryer was not strong enough to make me want to buy these again.  As I type this review the laundry I pulled from the dryer is still sitting next to the bed two days later (don't judge me) so I just leaned over and took a quick whiff and there is absolutely no remaining smell from the scent boosters.  So where my other scent booster left my clothes smelling wonderful for days, this one does not. It is just not worth the expense of this product to have only a nearly noticeable scent upon pulling clothes fresh out of the dryer and then absolutely no scent two days later. I'll go back to my other scent booster - which happens to also be Snuggle, but in liquid form.	-1
This product doesn't completely dissolve in warm or cold water and creates a hard glue like spot on your fabric.  It melts only so much and then catches on the fabric causing it to be stuck together in a wad.  If you pull it apart it will tear the fabric.  If you wash it again, it will dissolve, and the fabric can be saved.  As far as scent goes  I prefer the smell of some of their other scents.  Even so, the scent doesn't last.	-1
It was like any other water I've tasted.	-1
I usually don't buy bottled water, except to keep a small stock in the refrigerator in the event of a water outage or such, but I had some room in my Prime Pantry box, and there was an exceptional coupon which put the price near 50 a bottle, so I decided to give it a try. Well, I have to say I'm as unimpressed as it gets. It tastes like regular purified water, no difference in taste than to Ozarka. I was expecting a nice crisp taste like with Evian, but it's really just plain water. I would not buy this product again, and would not recommend it to others.	-1
Yuck	-1
Like eating fatty tubes of unflavored, mashed scraps. After eating two, I threw the rest away.	-1
These looked good once fried to get a crisp outer on them but the inside texture is terrible, mushy like baby food. No bite or chew to them, very unappealing texture.	-1
Not at all what I expected. No flavor at all.	-1
A little too smokey vs. tasty. Spongy texture and flavor does mimic some meat products I've had.	-1
just ok	-1
Gave 2 stars because can good arrived dented.  I don't purchase or consume dented can items for health reasons.  Needless to say don't even know how the product tastes because it was discarded.	-1
If  you put enough sauce on them and hide the taste these aren't too bad.  If you are looking for something that has the texture of chicken, this is not it.	-1
I gave the linkettd a try because I am struggling to find and get a hold of their "leanies" frozen vegetarian hot dogs which are great. I was hoping the linketts eould be as good as worthington/loma linda's "leanies", however they are not! These linketts are awful in taste as they are bery bland for any kind of flavor. The typical negative stereotypeof a vegetarian food. The texture of the linketts are accurate to a real meat hot dog texture which is cool but they taste absolutely bland! I had to add seasoning and himalayan pink salt to give the linketts flavor so that they wouldn't have to be tossed to the trash or wasted. Condiments alone wouldn't have made a difference to making the linketts taste better. I will never buy these or any of loma linda's canned priducts again. I will have to try to find the worthington/loma linda "leanies" or forget vegetarian hot dogs/links altogether.	-1
The taste of the gravy was not great.  If you wash it off and use a different condiment it is ok.	-1
I found that these are way too strong for my taste to the point of making my eyes water and making me gag I would not purchase again as they also leave a nasty after taste in my mouth. I can't say they do a very well on freshening my breath they just seem to taste terrible	-1
These strips are melt in your mouth fun. And offer about 3 seconds of freshness. Then the sensation and the effectiveness is gone, right after the 3 seconds.	-1
i didn't like the taste.burned my tongue	-1
They came stuck together. I was disappointed.	-1
Too strong	-1
nasty taste that coats ur mouth	-1
The taste is awful,  it burns your mouth & tongue, plus it doesn't smell good. How is this freshening my breath at all. It's way too many chemical-ly tasting for me. Never again	-1
I'm not sure how effective this stuff is but it is the worst tasting mouth wash I've ever tried.	-1
The price was good and it had high reviews, so I tried it.  Will never purchase again.  The floss breaks easily, you can break it just pulling it from the container.  It shreds and can get easily stuck between teeth.  Since it is shreds so easily you can't go a couple times on each tooth, Once and you have to use more floss.  I find I'm having to pull out a couple feet of floss to get the job done.  Just terrible.	-1
its open! no cover	-1
Unfortunately, this ended up being a waste of money as something within the liquid caused an allergic reaction that was quite unpleasant. I'm told that "anti cavity" type mouthwashes can cause this reaction in users so just be forewarned.	-1
I thought it would be minty tasting and not anything like the original nasty Listerine.	-1
This item really has an unpleasant taste.  Just wasn't for me.	-1
all broken	-1
Not great.	-1
Didn't do it for me, the veggie straws are much better.	-1
I was not impressed by the taste. I won't be buying these again.	-1
I just did not like them	-1
Hollow cylinders, these apple cinnamon straws have a good crunch and a one ounce serving looks like a lot, but like many snacks, they are not filling. The base for the snack is an assortment of flours  corn, rice, wheat, oat, barley and potato. Following the order on the ingredient list, sugar falls between the oat and barley flour with apple puree and flavoring further down the list.  The fat level may be 30 percent less than potato chips (7 grams versus 11 grams) but I am having trouble seeing this as a positive thing, or for that matter understanding the thinking behind this snack when there are other less processed options with no fat grams, like dehydrated apples.  Further nutritional comparisons with potato chips reveal the same level of carbohydrate at 15 grams, sodium is a little better at 100mg versus 180mg with chips, sugar is one gram higher with these sticks and the rest of the breakdown is the same between the two snacks.  Regarding flavor, I like cinnamon but sometimes it has an almost perfume/air fragrance taste. Hard to describe but it is instantly recognizable when encountered, which is the case here.  And, it is more prominent than the apple flavor which fades to the background.  The product is edible but I do not like it enough to buy it again. The bag in my prime pantry box had a best by date nine months in the future.	-1
Not impressive.  Very little apple flavor. Very little flavor at all. Small single serving package a bit pricey. I guess it's ok if you want to munch on puffed up air with calories.	-1
not salty.  no taste whatsoever	-1
I don't know what's worse, the taste or the fact that despite the name, this product does not contain vegetables.  Given the fat content and calories, I would have been better off buying baked potato chips.	-1
I thought this would make a nice snack.  Wrong.  Not much flavor and they were extremely salty.  Had to toss them.	-1
These bags are Tiny not for a Grown Man more for little kids	-1
The flavor is ok, But there are no actual vegetables in this. There are some types of dried vegetables like this, but these are not actually dried veggies.	-1
Cheaper at Wal Mart and smaller bag	-1
I didn't like this ones. Not nice taste. With chessee maybe are ok. I won't buy this ones again.	-1
very disappointed bags were not even half full	-1
I was not impressed by the taste. I won't be buying these again.	-1
Very little flavor and they all taste the same.  Will not order these again.	-1
Okay, overpriced. I won't buy again.	-1
Small bag not very full, and not as good as the ones from Wal Mart	-1
these are dry and horrible, my kids won't eat them, never buying again	-1
Super crumbly and my one year old doesn't care for them. We like the Earth's Best brand better than these, but they are all tiny and overpriced. We are just going to buy Nutrigrain's from now on.	-1
My kid hates this and the whole line of "Jammy Sammy".	-1
My kid hates this and the whole line of "Jammy Sammy".	-1
Neither of my kids liked these so I tried one and I spit it out. Way too sweet and the peanut butter didn't taste like peanut butter at all.	-1
Didn't work at all for me.  I took three before bed for three nights and still woke up with terrible cramps.  I slept well but I always do.	-1
The blueberries are wonderful but I really wish they hadn't been moved to PrimePantry with the dried cherries. I'll be buying less of them from now on.	-1
Not great as another brand I have purchased. Simply don't think it dissolves as rapidly	-1
For some reason, this made us break out in a rash for the first time. Have been a purchaser for years. Will not buy again.	-1
Waaaay too sweet for me.	-1
We purchased this ketchup via Prime Pantry for the balsamic vinegar and were disappointed. It tastes like Heinz ketchup (with High Fructose Corn Syrup) and being a balsamic lover, I had high hopes...  My husband couldn't taste a difference at all. To me, it tasted subtly less sugary but no real tangy flavor. Not that it tasted terrible but I definitely wouldn't recommend paying extra for this and we won't order it again.  Uploading photos so you can get a closer look and see the ingredients. Smile. Hope this is helpful!	-1
Great price but too many chemicals. Will donate to food pantry.	-1
I've always bought the little jars of sweet relish and just love them. This is the first time I bought Heinz relish as well as first time i've bought sweet relish in a squeezable plastic bottle. It definitely tasted different than the little jars of relish i've been buying for so many years. Don't think i'll buy this again.	-1
Tastes funny to me. Not like the ketchup I grew up with, and I am real curious as to why. I've always loved the vinegar taste in Heinz, but something is just off with this stuff. It doesn't taste bad, just not normal, which is disappointing considering that this version should be healthier for consumers than their HFCS non-Organic versions.	-1
seal was open, the ketchup run watery,	-1
I bought this mistaking less sugar for less ALL sugars. But unfortunately they mean less cane sugar, more fake sugar. Not at all what I expected. Should have read the details...	-1
Tastes funny?	-1
Not strong enough roast	-1
Not good taste	-1
note the best coffee ive ever had.	-1
Tastes awful. I had to give it away.	-1
Had not tried this scent and won't try again.  Almost smells like Kool-Aid...not good.  Will keep around for emergencies only.	-1
Half empty	-1
The product arrived wrapped up in good condition but the contents was a gooey mess. The smell is unappealing to me and I plan on placing this set where it belongs, it the garbage! I do not recommend this and I wish I had not wasted a measly $4 on it. Try putting this mess on your armpits---it literally becomes a mess.	-1
got lipton because of using the bags.  I don't like this, you may.  It so fine it comes thru the keurig container and residue in you cup which doesn't taste so good.  I'll not buy it again.	-1
TASTE LIKE CANNED SOUP I WILL NEVER PURCHASE AGAIN	-1
Nothing like what I used to get at Costco for much less money. Disappointing.	-1
Horrible. Campbell's you really MISSED the mark; will never order agian	-1
The worst Campbells soup ever.  Just plain nasty and I love most Campbells soups..	-1
I like the idea of organic soup, but this tasted a bit weird - I'm thinking it's possibly due to using an aseptic container.	-1
too sweet.  This is a pretty watery soup and sugar is listed before water.  I don't eat much sugar so when I tasted this it was just too sweet for me.  I like chicken tortilla soup but have never had one that required sugar in the recipe.  I like the fact that it is organic, but as for flavor it just didn't taste like a tortilla soup to me.  I will just continue to make my own.	-1
OMG What is with companies loading everything with salt???  I had to dilute it with milk and even then it was too much sodium. Taste would have been good without the overpowering salt. Guess I learned my lesson: never buy Campbell's soup until they learn to tighten the salt shaker.	-1
YUCK!! Way too sweet. I could not choke it down:(	-1
OMG it tastes terrible. I would NEVER buy this again.	-1
First of all, I think it's great that Campbell's has come out with an organic line.  At least they are trying.  This product however, (for me) was a miss.  I did not care for it all.  I had to add a lot of salt and pepper and Tabasco!  Even with all that, it still was bland.	-1
I am sorry I purchased these. I opened one when I wasn't feeling well and did not like it.  I don't buy many canned goods and never soup (not for years) I thought chicken soup would make me feel better but this tasted like a old can.  I purchased a few and won't use the other ones I bought.	-1
This is screwed up. Trying g to review the chefboyardee and the picture of the olive oil shows up. Computer error.	-1
These 7 oz boxes are $1.00 or so at the dollar store. Not worth it.	-1
These crackers are really tasty but the box is tiny!  I didn't even know Cheezits came in such small boxes!  You can get regular Cheez-its for like 20 cents more and you get almost twice as much!  Don't be fooled like I was!  It's easy to be tricked online by size!	-1
EXCELLENT... if you want to feel horrible from the amount of MSG in these little turd crackers. Seriously, if you want to feel sick these are guaranteed to make you feel that way. Don't be fooled that these have less sodium just because they aren't orange ! Disgusting AND super bad for you !	-1
TERRIBLE bang for your buck. Buy this from the store. It's a tiny package that it comes in. You could buy a family size in some places for the price of this.	-1
Barely edible for me, the only good thing I can say is that they are better than the regular cheddar variety which are nasty.	-1
tastes like cardboard	-1
very imitation blueberry tasting, stick with the raspberry flavored	-1
over half of each box was shredded in the bottom I called Kellogg's company and they agreed with me that they have had the same complains also.	-1
Not my favorite.	-1
I bought these cuz they were much cheaper than my regular brand.  Never again. I did not like the texture or taste.	-1
item came crushed had to throw them out. also they were old	-1
All broken to pieces! Not one cone is complete!=All broken in small amounts!  No it did not meet my expectations!	-1
Delicious but broken. Makes a better crumble topping them ice cream cone. Box was in perfect condition but cones were crushed.	-1
This product is from Vietnam and only labeled for a company in McKinleyville, Ca. Nowhere on the listing did it say is was from Vietnam, a country known to use forced slave labor on their fishing vessels as well as having poisons in their water.  The product tasted overly "fishy" indicating improper handling of the fish prior to processing.  Truly fresh fish does not smell very strong either prior to or after production.	-1
Yuck, taste like sawdust or something NOT Cheddar. Never aghain.	-1
Salty and nothing but chewy skin	-1
greasy, hurts stomach but you will like it. I'm sensitive.	-1
Too greasy - not to my taste - like Wisconsin beef bars better	-1
to strong	-1
For what they are, they're fine, but I'd go with a different jerky if you're thru-hiking. These are smaller, there's a lot of extraneous packing due to being individually wrapped, and they don't taste the greatest. They'll do if you're on a budget.	-1
Ones received were hard and dry. A couple of them "broke off".	-1
When i received the box it was damaged and laundry detergent was all inside box spilled on food and can of sprite was exploded and cookies had soap all over them and box of Barilla Pasta, Spaghetti, 32 Ounce was open and popcorn with soap every where so I am a little mad right now!!	-1
False advertising.  Originals are not 4 inches long and approximately as big around as a cigarette.	-1
dogs didn't even gobble this up	-1
I usually like Slim Jims, but these have hard things in some of the sticks - teeny hard white things that might break your teeth if you bite down too hard on one, so, chew lightly, my friend.	-1
didn't realize they were so small	-1
Yuck!  Sucks....... Droopy bacon in  a package	-1
tasted like mudd	-1
Some of the stew cans were old with green mold which apparently exploded during shipment covering the other  items and the box with the green mold and contents.  This was shipped to my brother in college and he apparently thought one item was ok and got a bad case of food poisoning, vomiting for a week, We had to discard the shipment.  Obviously, the stew was too old and should not have been shipped in the first place.	-1
Chocolate tasted off - as if burnt	-1
palm oil YUCK  gave them away.	-1
Yuck. Taste weird. Vanilla especially.	-1
Seal broke	-1
Wish I could rate lower. I received these and the vanilla were fine, but the chocolate were not. I kept feeling these tiny super thin pieces of plastic in the pudding. I threw the first away and tried another. The second cup was the same. I contacted the company but they didn't seemed too concerned. I threw them all away.	-1
There is something off about the box we got. Tasted... Fake? We couldn't eat it at all.	-1
I think I will stick to getting these from sam's club.  These were not fresh.  The chocolate was fine but the vanilla had a funky taste to it, like it had been in storage for way too long.	-1
I hadn't had this since I was a child. I added it to fill up a Prime Pantry order. Eating it was a bit nostalgic for me, but it doesn't taste nearly as good as it did when I was 9. Maybe they've changed the recipe or maybe my tastes have changed. I honestly don't know for sure, but I do know this pudding doesn't taste very good. The chocolate was ok, but the vanilla tasted artificial and just plain gross.	-1
Nice try. But I did not like these at all. Got them so my Diabetic  son could have a snack. Not tasty.	-1
Know that they will arrive in a million bits.	-1
I should have heeded the other reviewer's opinion.  These are rather bland, particularly for a product that states "triple ginger."  Do yourself a favor and buy Newman's Own gingersnaps instead.  Those cookies have a lot of ginger flavor and are crispy.  These are bland and dry.  I'm a bit surprised since I like a lot of other products made by Back To Nature.	-1
Dry, dusty texture and bland flavor.	-1
I didn't like the very chewy ginger pieces. If you like chewy ginger pieces in a crunchy ginger cookie then these are for you.	-1
Turns stools to liquid. I'm a healthy, balanced eater, but a single dose of this gives me the runs for a day. Tried more than once. It's a waste of money, unless you're constipated.	-1
not color I expected	-1
I didn't find it anything close to what was described was quite disappointed in overall coverage	-1
the eyeshadow plalet is way to small and not nice. I only like the black eyeliner	-1
I bought this because it seemed extremely inexpensive, and I see that it was for a reason. I will go through the products one by one: Mascara- there is a black side and a brown side. Neither give any sort of volume or definition, it just kind of clumps up and sits there. The wand is short and stubby, not long enough to add definition at all. Eyeshadow- These eyeshadows LOOK nice and the color payoff looks great initially, but once you put them on you see that they don't last long at all, even with an eye shadow primer. The shadows crease and seem to just fade away during the day, no matter what I have tried. Eyeliners- This comes with two eyeliners. One is black and one is like a highlighter color. The highlighter color provides basically no payoff at all, and the black liner simply smears and bleeds, doesn't last at all. This seems like a good deal, but really, it's not. There is a reason why it's so inexpensive.	-1
It was ok	-1
I did not like the feel of this lotion. I left my skin dry and flaky. I am sorry, but I will not use this lotion again.	-1
These used to have a fantastic vanilla flavor.  Now they taste like nothing at all.  The recipe has been changed, and not for the better.	-1
Didn't like the tadte	-1
I'm sure there are others who love these things but they were way too tart for me.	-1
No, sir, I did not like it, said the Horse.	-1
OK nothing great it will clean your hair but I think the advertising to overboard!	-1
Not for me. Don't like how my hair feels after washing	-1
I usually love Aussie products but this line made my head itch and break out - so weird	-1
I didn't like it too much. Brought it to work to let others have it	-1
When i received the box it was damaged and laundry detergent was all inside box spilled on food and can of sprite was exploded and cookies had soap all over them and box of Barilla Pasta, Spaghetti, 32 Ounce was open and popcorn with soap every where so I am a little mad right now!!	-1
Thanks for nothing.  I got three packs of two in one box - that means there were six, not 8 in the box.  I normally don't buy Pop Tarts, and this reminds me why.	-1
It either was me, a bad box, or something else because these tasted dull...  Chocolate is the only way to go!	-1
These were worth a try, but unfortunately I didn't get the Blue Raspberry candy/snowcone flavor I was hoping for.	-1
Sorry - I fully expected I would have a great review for Maxwell House coffee, but this particular batch of K-cups is a disaster.  The first cup I brewed, the K-pot ran really slow, and seemed to struggle to finish brewing the cup.  My next cup that morning was a different coffee, and the pot brewed normally again.  Next day, the Maxwell House pods again brewed very slowly.  The next day, my pot would not brew at all.  Nothing would get it to brew.  Eventually (after finding coffee elsewhere) I did all the cleaning things, especially the upper needle.  I ran plain water (no pod) and got a cup loaded with very fine coffee grounds. I ran this cleaning a few times.  I used other pods for a while, and all was fine in my world.  But in the interest of science, I ran plain water after each cup - no fine grounds. So, now I tried another MH pod - and the problem instantly came back.  After the very slow brew, I ran a plain water through, and again had a cup loaded with fine grounds.  I know the coffee is probably fine, but the pods are defective, and dangerous to my pot - which has been a loyal and dependable machine until now.  And me without coffee - well, that is dangerous too!  ;-)	-1
I not the biggest fan of the flavor	-1
bitter and to sweet.	-1
I THOUGHT THE FLavor was disgusting	-1
TO SWEET... WAS SUPPOSE TO BE ORANGE FLAVOR...	-1
Does not taste the same as orange in the bottle.  Made exact to receipe.  Then tried adding a little more.  Has a heavy citric acid taste.	-1
I got hives from extended use of this (bought twice). They immediately went away with a little cortisone and rewashing all the clothes/sheets done with this. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin.	-1
Packed with the food. Yuck. Who does that?	-1
Really a waste of money: Barely cleans, No smell, No softness, my kids don't like using it, my husband tried to use 3-4 per load, so DON'T DO IT	-1
DONT BUY... I have never had hives but got it from this stuff.... I had used it occasionally before but apparently a large and consistent dose does it. Once rewashed all my clothes in purex no further hives.	-1
Too dark, almost black; not the color in the picture or description. The plastic gloves are so low quality and small that they rip immediately, proving to be useless.	-1
Box was crushed and bars broken	-1
too salty	-1
My local grocery used to carry this brand and most of their items were worth the splurge over cheaper ramen style noodles. They're not healthy we all know that. The nutritional content is pretty standard for this type of product. Loaded with sodium and msg. Don't let that little packet of seeweed powder fool you. Some things are worth the nutritional splurge once in awhile, so you eat something bad for you just because it tastes good. This was so not worth it. The seasoning is kind of wierd, a bit to sweet on the sweet and salty variety. The noodles, while nice, firm and otherwise good were extremely oily. Oily in the same way that bad chinese take out lo mein is on the second day. The little packet of seaweed flakes is quite bright green, but it was very powdery and stuck to the roof of my mouth in a very unpleasant way. I got about three bites in and threw it out. It's not terrible, but it isn't good either. If I'm going to eat pure junk food then I at least wanted it to taste good. There are similar products in this price range that are a lot better than this.	-1
Not impressed, I'll stick with ramen... not worth the price	-1
Seasoning pack is overwhelming - too sweet and salty.	-1
not worth the price	-1
I really like using sriracha in certain dishes.  I tried using this in a few things and just couldn't find anything I liked about it.  Other than the heat that it added.	-1
love this stuff ,this is my third time order .but this time it wasn't packed well.	-1
The flavor and the ramen itself is just subpar. Highly disappointed.	-1
The ingredients list is far longer and more processed than I realized. My dog has a sensitive stomach, and it did not agree with her.	-1
Opened package day of delivery and inside was a melted solid mass. No holes, no pockets. I broke off a piece to see how my dog felt about flavor amd for the first time in ten years she spit something out. Maybe the texture was the issue.	-1
I got these for our elderly cat who needed a month of antibiotics. She wouldn't touch them. I figured rather than waste the whole bag, I would give the remainder of the pockets to the other cats as treats. Even our fat cat (think basketball with legs) who never turns down food was not interested in these.	-1
A bit too hard...harder than they used to be.	-1
The antibiotic just falls out of these, even when mushed in and my cat just tastes it and spits it out and then won't go for it again. I was better off just using one hand to spread her jaw and tilt her head up and another to drop the tiny medicine into her mouth, closing her mouth and gently massaging her throat so she swallows it and doesn't just spit it out.  Skip it unless your cat really likes the taste of funky rubber-ish treats.	-1
IT SMELLS UP THE WHOLE ROOM. IT GIVES MY DOG DIARRHEA AND SHE THREW UP. SHE LIKES THE CHICKEN AND IT DOESN'T HAVE A DISGUSTING ODOR.	-1
my cat isn't crazy about them t	-1
Nope - my cat hated them	-1
They made her sick.	-1
My older cat does not like these. If I don't have any other types of cat treats, she will pick at these. Only, if she's desperate, though.	-1
I cannot think what possible advantage these containers have over plastic containers you can reuse.  They don't go into the conventional over, just a microwave.  The lids do not fit tightly, so you cannot transport food without spillage.  You cannot store anything too moist in them because they are paper and absorb liquid.  They are cheap, but not reusable.  I'm going back to Gladware.	-1
Made of really tough paper or something but when I stored some wet food in it, it held up better than I thought it would, didn't soak through or even break although it felt like it was on the verge of it. Seems like a single-use food storage container is more of a waste than the plastic ones tho, so I'll be sticking to the washable plastic ones to store leftovers. Didn't use it to heat anything, so can't comment on the durability in the microwave.	-1
I'm all for saving the planet, but I'm also selfish and practical, so I generally use Tupperware and/or the little plastic containers that pre-packaged cold cuts come in. The concept of a biodegradable "Heat & Eat" container was intriguing, so I figured I'd give it a try. The size is nice, and each container can hold a generous portion of food. I wasn't thrilled by the loose fit of the lid, but I could live with it. What I couldn't live with was the fact that, after a night in the fridge, my leftover Hamburger Helper had pretty much soaked through the bottom of the container. The container wasn't ruined, the food was OK, and it survived the microwave process, but that really turned me off to the product. If I'm paying for a product that can only be used once, it had better work perfectly that one time. If you're on Extreme Cheapskates, and are trying to reuse this...? That's on you. If I can't even get ONE use out of it...? Sayonara. I haven't attempted to use any of the remaining eight containers.	-1
I like the concept of these containers, but the reality is that they aren't of high enough quality that I would move away from using my glass containers with locking lids.  Unfortunately, the "locking" of the lids on these Reynolds containers is very slight.  There is no way you would want to put one of these in a bag with other things and run to work as I could easily see the lid coming off and your food ending up all over whatever else is in your bag.  The container itself is, as one would expect with a disposable item, fairly insubstantial.  Think of a "to go" container at a deli or restaurant that doesn't use plastic containers.  My main beef with these, though, is that the lids cannot be microwaved, a fact I didn't notice when ordering the product.  I understand that some people don't want to microwave plastic, even plastic that's supposedly safe to microwave, but for most foods having a cover while cooking in a microwave is a must unless you want to have to clean the microwave after every use.  I don't understand why Reynolds couldn't have made the lid such that it could have withstood microwaving a single time.  Really, the only use for these I see is giving some food to someone so that you don't have to worry about getting your container back.	-1
I did not like this product at all.  Firstly, it does not hold 24 oz. comfortably.  Even  24 oz of just liquid does not fit in this container.  I would say closer to 16 oz of food fits comfortably (so that you can heat and mix it).  The cover is flimsy and does not click into place snuggly.  As far a leak proof goes, it is not at all leak proof.  The cover is not microwaveable which defeats the purpose.  The bottom container is made of cardboard? so don't even think about liquids for long periods of time.  Maybe a salad would be nice to put in here but keep the dressing on the side.  I cannot recommend this product.	-1
These things are to huge for me.  got more trouble with them than any help, gave them away to someone who could use them.	-1
too light weight. I just thought I would try it. Don't like it.	-1
These are tiny, wimpy, and expensive.	-1
Thin plastic but adequate for the price.	-1
I won't buy these again.  I didn't realize how microwave unfriendly they are.  They end up warped and unusable if you try to heat food on them.  That's pretty much why I have paper plates around - to heat food in the microwave and eat.  This is probably the first Hefty product I haven't liked.	-1
I didn't take into consideration the fact they are "everyday" plates. Not up to my standards	-1
I wanted a natural lemon smell and this smells like baby wipes!	-1
I really wanted to love this room freshener.  I've heard such great things about the Mrs Meyers products, and I love the smell of lemons, so thought this would be a good product for me to try.  My 83-year-old Mother lives with us, and her room has that 'old people' smell to it.  I had hoped that this spray would be able to freshen things up!  Unfortunately, we were disappointed with the results.  When sprayed, it left behind a scent reminiscent of a certain lemon scented furniture polish.  I have also tried using this in the bathroom, to freshen it up after use, but we just don't like the smell.  Maybe a different scent of this product would be better, I just can't recommend the lemon verbena.	-1
hard as a brick. Won't buy again. tastes like horse feed	-1
Oddly, I didn't care much for these, though I love their peanuts in the glass jars.  These just weren't salty and had a lot more 'skins' per bag.  Won't be buying these again, but I'll still buy the jars.	-1
These are the perfect size for portion control. I have purchased many boxes of these and every package has been fresh and tasty. Update..I no longer purchase these because of the big price increase. No longer economical.	-1
Oh dear.  These were one step away from rancid when they arrived.  Very disappointing because the price was great but now I know why.  It's strange because the expiration date was April 2017, yet every bag I opened had that rancid nut taste that's immediately recognizable.  Threw out nearly the whole box which is never good because I hate wasting $$ like that.	-1
Wet and sticky and did not do well with food. Threw it away.	-1
Not a fan	-1
it was rancid	-1
I won't be ordering this again - - taste is awful!!!	-1
This toothpaste is way to sweet!  I don't understand why they have to put sugar in toothpaste.  Gave away	-1
eh. not the best. doesn't taste great. Certainly wouldn't purchase again.	-1
Size is great for the little one in my home BUT the reason I bought them was for the kid designed bottles described in their ad as: " Every bottle features colorful labels and messages designed to appeal to children, delivering smiles with every sip. There are 8 fun designs in all!"  We received nothing more than regular water labels.  I would of bought these in the store & saved postman & myself that much extra weight in delivered package	-1
When I saw the colorful bottles I was fooled.  These are not flavored.  I can get twice as much for half the price at the store	-1
As far as purified tap water, these are fine (although I do prefer the cleaner taste of spring water). But I bought these since it's a perfect small size for kids lunches and the advertised print on the labels at the time I purchased (in AUGUST!) was sports/balls etc... but instead they shipped me the ugly Halloween edition, which we don't even celebrate. So now I just rip the nasty labels off.	-1
Thought this would be a good snack, but it is tasteless....sorry I bought it.	-1
I found the taste of this (so called) juice revolting. I have loved V-8 juice since I was very young.  This puts t the product name to shame.	-1
The filling is awful. I'll never buy it again. Didn't taste like Pizza at all, and the texture was like chalk.	-1
I expected them to be bigger. These were like dessert plates. Tiny.	-1
Can't use with anything hot. Will burn and fuse together. The size is awfully small too. NOT a happy customer.	-1
This is my fault for not reading the description about this only being a 7inch plate but because of its size it is surely not worth this cost.  This is an honest and genuine review!	-1
It didn't work for me but I'm a hard case	-1
Oh, this tastes so bad! I buy a lot of cranberry teas from other vendors, and this tastes nothing like those...it tastes terrible. I am sure it does make you go to the bathroom a lot (but all tea does)...but I just can't stomach this stuff, and neither could my husband. Ugh.	-1
HATE THE TASTE!!	-1
Waste of money, very little taste, no buzz.	-1
Hated the taste!!	-1
Don't like the taste...	-1
They are not very flavorful.  Just kind of bland.	-1
Watery	-1
Too sweet.	-1
Not good at all	-1
The ginger flavor was strong but the actual cookie was kinda hard and crunchy. They are not like the shortbread from this company that I've had before, not like proper shortbread which is buttery and melts in your mouth. I wouldn't buy them again.	-1
Packaging deceptive, Shortbread tastes good what there was of it. Bought both sizes & found the same thing; all package, very little product enclosed.	-1
Didn't like it, tasted like savory orange soap	-1
does not taste like shortbread	-1
Bitter	-1
Worst coffee ever tasted	-1
Very weak. Minimal coffee, and mocha flavor. Watered down taste. If your looking for a caffeine boost...go elsewhere. Only 43 mg of caffeine in an 8.4 oz. can as compared to 125 mg. caffeine of leading competitor! That's 3 times as much...	-1
Weak! No expresso flavor, very little cocoa taste. I was disappointed since I like the illy brand ground expresso and use it in my expresso machine frequently. If you need to get an expresso drink in a can, get Starbucks. It is worth the extra money	-1
Best peach flavored iced tea.	-1
This is really gross. Snapple is much much better. We couldn't finish even one.	-1
order diet, got real thing	-1
Love Vicks Vicks is Fantastic for so many things  DO NOT BUY ON LINE... but buying on line bottle smaller ...too pricey... Can get much larger container for what I paid for this one Big Mistake	-1
nasty we think they were bad had nasty taste	-1
Tasted like cardboard. Hard to cheap.	-1
Let me try organizing my admittedly not-so-great thoughts about this for the sake of you, the reader...  I can't recommend this brand of freeze dried strawberries for a few easy-to-pinpoint reasons:  1) Mold. Munching along, my hand turning a color reminiscent of Halloween fake blood when I made the mistake of reaching into the bag (do pour freeze dried fruit into a bowl/onto a plate, ideally in a space you can clean any dust up as there will be dust/seeds no matter how much care is taken to dry the fruit delicately!)... the simple process of grab, bite, smile, and swallow had steps 3+4 replaced by cringe+spit. That unforgettable taste of fruit gone bad was present in far too many berries. I blame this on poor quality control,and I blame poor QC on #2:  2) Sourced from all over the place... No thanks. There are plenty of berries right here in North America where their facilities operate (where they bag them and sell them at horribly inflated prices for fruit from all over the place with cheaper than dirt cheap labor and zero oversight in the end of the crops)...  3) Beyond the mold, probably again thanks to #2, the flavor varied wildly. That would be fine were this a wild-growing, foraged sort of crop... It is an agribusiness, though, and some were really tart, some bland, some fine, some bleh. Dust will happen regardless of the brand/farm, and seeds will definitely be loose (you should definitely eat them-they are the healthiest part of strawberries!)... but there should be some sampling done to ensure they aren't selling fruit that was picked too early or late-either is unacceptable.  4, well 3.5) There is a perfectly good, slightly less expensive (no fancy packaging or importing costs), very CONSISTENT alternative and it is a brand/place I honestly almost never recommend: Trader Joe's. Yeah, that place. The place I literally only go to grab avocados and bananas and occasionally repackaged cheese I recognize or repackaged buttery thin almond sliver cookies from Belgium before my doc told me to cut gluten out because my immune system was PO'ed at the stuff... It is now a place for avocados, bananas, very occasionally their whole milk strawberry Greek yogurt (partly because they have forks and spoons in two bags at the check out-smart people!-and I am often there around 2pm and haven't yet paused for lunch but my beloved nearby family hole in the wall restaurant closes from 2-5)... Now add dried fruit to that list, specifically strawberries and sometimes mangos; maybe blue/raspberries or even pineapple(prob not the pineapple as it hasn't been my favorite thing freeze dried-its liquid is its charm). Anyway, if you DO have access to a TJ's, a place I wouldn't pay a dime for 90% of the offerings of, well, I can honestly recommend you go, rip open a bag of theirs, see if the tartness level is okay by your standards, and depending on whether you can get there any time or it is a bit of a trek, get a few bags or enough for an apocalyptic scenario. Ah, and if you don't have a dish, have a vinyl or nitrile glove when you dive in unless you want to accidentally dust-paint anything your hand touches a rosy hue -the glove removal is easier than washing hands without touching anything between my eating spots and sink, I have found, though I usually stick to the tiny bowl method and have a couple alcohol or other hand wipes wherever I am, ready for immediate use once I am done with this messy snack choice.  Ah, I see people mentioning (in questions) things like smoothies... Not recommended: go for frozen or fresh if that is your goal-these are a tad powdery and entirely dry and lighter than a corn flake so their density isn't suited for rehydration in any means except perhaps w/cereal, the brief hydration of cereal, or maybe mayyybe yogurt though I would do fresh for that or even go for jam before freeze dried since the wafer texture would to me be off putting (just my 2; do your thing, whatever it is, so long as it is not harmful to others or ideally yourself!)  Natierra's folks, if you are reading this, consider local, easy to control quality-wise, produce. Berries are abundant in the US-all year, even, though summer is when they taste like berries should and cost normal amounts... My understanding is that you are like the gift wrapping department of JC Penney... Making the item's presentation more frilly isn't what we want w/food; if you are really confident, try clear bags... Charging $2 more (yeah, yeah, I know half goes to the store, but we are talking about pretty small amounts of fruit-fruit supposedly certified organic but much like cheap-o apple juice, who knows what the conditions are when they come here from three or four countries, a few CONTINENTS, even-without so much as a silica packet in the bag to prevent the boat's varying humidity from ruining the goods... Charging a couple bucks more, MORE AT ALL in fact, for imported berries than the US-berries from TJ's is pretty elitist and unrealistic, don't you think? You get cheap crops from people making less than a dollar every two days of sunrise tp sunset labor but charge more than people paid 20x that even when NOT totally abiding by labor laws? Importing tropical fruit is, pineapple aside since Hawaii has entire areas devoted to nothing but pineapple, okay...berries? Not okay. I am not the only one who prefers my food to be from a bit closer than Africa, Poland, etc (there were a lot of oddball places I don't remember all of but berries=US; otherwise you are wrecking the environment for massive profit when you can do like the others and contract w/US farms or at least US+Mexico if quantity is truly somehow an issue which seems false given how easily they can, w/a written contract, replace less profitable fruit w/berries for you as they did for TJ's)... Oh, maybe consider consistency for mangos, too... Would be nice if all of them were the FEW mm thick when dry, not one mm thick like the last couple bags I bought. Honestly, I hesitate to spend $5+ again for unpleasantly hard slivers thinner than almond slivers... The flavor is awfully hard to enjoy when crunching something harder than most ice.	-1
I do not like the taste.	-1
I feel for the packaging and expected this to be a healthy snack. There are no vitamins or any extra nutrition in these chips. Why bother?	-1
Like eating salty cardboard.	-1
Really wanted to like these but yuck.	-1
Some people may care for it, but not me.	-1
Man, these were bad. I eat about anything, but considered tossing the bag. Yeah, that bad. If someone likes these things, there's something sad about that person, probably neglect, abuse, possibly starvation.	-1
Would not buy again. I thought these were chips made from vegetables but its mostly powders.  Taste is blah.	-1
if you want salty and crunchy, it's both of those things. otherwise it's not much flavor and i would not buy these again.	-1
You know those packing peanuts you use to get in boxes? Ok, so get one of those, add some color to it, flatten it a little and you have these.  SO not a good taste. No one at all has liked these. I've begged people to take them off of my hands.	-1
Stale chips..not fresh!	-1
not great	-1
Stale, threw them in the garbage.	-1
Does a good job but smells way too much like bleach	-1
Love the product, but it arrived with a broken top and spilled all over my floor.	-1
I am not happy with Clorox right now. I bought this to avoid wasting an entire bottle of the same stuff I had bought locally...but it was damaged -- wouldn't spray. I tried fixing it myself, but the sprayer hose was damaged and wouldn't create a seal necessary for pumping. I wrote the good folk at Clorox, expecting to be offered a refund or replacement coupon at the very least. Instead, ignoring my description of the problem, they sent me directions for "reseating" a broken sprayer. Sorry, Clorox, broken is NOT the same as not working, and I know the dif. Assuming customers are idiots is never good for business. I will likely look for an alternative once this is used up.	-1
bottle came discolored and leaking onto my food items.	-1
Didn't work well for me. Tried using this on some typical soap scum in the tub and I had to scrub quite a bit to clean the tub.	-1
Disappointed; basically a ripoff.	-1
Didnt work. i was awake all day and night.	-1
Figured this would be better than taking normal nyquil when I just want something to help me sleep, but the taste is so bad I can barely get it down and it didn't seem to work much better than normal nyquil anyway. I haven't bought again and probably won't, I will stick with nyquil.	-1
The label states that this is good for making ice cream, but don't think that this means the texture is the same as using real heavy cream! I followed the directions for reconstituting the powder, left it over night and then made the ice cream. The consistency was more like ice milk. It was not creamy at all. I will only be using this powder in soups and other recipes that don't really require the creaminess of real heavy cream.	-1
Sadly...this was...disgusting.  Arrived not sealed...smelled...like a dirty milking parlor.  and yes I have been in many .  Does not reconstitute not that I planned to drink it but wanted to see...it did as they say..and it would whip etc.  and it does not.  Never thickened into anything resembling whipping cream..and stick blender would not change the watery powdery texture..other that to have a bit of foam on the top.  I am so disappointed..I had high hopes to never run out o whipping cream again.  I even wasted a cup o hot coffee to see if it would disolve in it and it did not.  Amazon Prime made it right but..I wanted...a pound of cream powder that would do what it said.  I would rather have had a replacement but they don't seem to stock it now.	-1
Dog hates them	-1
Had to though these out. I couldn't even smash them into smaller pieces	-1
Not a favorite of Gizmo...	-1
I was so surprised by the size of thee package. Dogs not even interested.	-1
Tiny bag and tiny treats!!! I assumed when I bought these that the size of the bag would be comparable to what you'd expect to find in any pet store, so I didn't look very closely at the ounces. When I took them out of the shipping box, I started laughing. It reminded me of a novelty product, that's how tiny it is. It's hard to judge size with products on the internet, so be aware, you get very little here.	-1
I have five little dogs and none of them would eat these :/	-1
My dog is allergic to them	-1
My dog hated these things...I gave her one, and she just let it fall out of her mouth, and she gave me the dirtiest look and just walked away from the treat...I actually felt bad, like I betrayed her trust by making her think she was going to be getting something delicious.  Another thing, these treats are VERY small, and more suitable for smaller dogs despite what it says about "All sizes".	-1
My black lab doesn't like them & he eats most anything	-1
The bags were smaller than I thought they would be. More over, on the 4th and final bag I couldn't get my dog To eat them anymore.	-1
Tiny biscuits...not worth the price.	-1
I threw them out. My 10 year old loves them, but after seeing the calories, sugar, and ingredients, I regretted getting them. If you want a delicious snack to help your kids get fat and unhealthy, I think this is the right way to go.	-1
Possible value compared to 8 packs. OK sugary taste but now mostly flour/ crust. Size is small and imperfect. Really sad. generics are	-1
Nothing wrong with the packaging or quality, it's just I forgot how disgusting Pop Tarts are when i purchased these for my App Trail hiking. They manage to be over-sweet, artificial, and dry, all at the same time. You have to drink more water than necessary to get them down. hey also crumble so easily and become a hassle to try to eat on the move. Would not recommend for through hikers.	-1
These look disgusting and taste weird. There is black stuff on them. Kinda look moldy.	-1
All of the icing was missing from the poptarts.	-1
love pot-tarts but in this box teh tarts were so dry they fell apart as i took them out of the foil wrappers	-1
strawberry gives it 3 stars brown sugar gave it - 1	-1
What you get is a bag of mostly peanuts, with a few nuts of the other varieties mixed in. They were very bland with almost no salt flavor. I have eaten low sodium mixed nuts that tasted saltier than these. The overwhelming flavor was under-roasted and under-salted peanut. In a half cup I found exactly 1/8 of a pecan. I do like some of the Happy Belly products, but this one was a miss. Not recommended	-1
Really bad	-1
I love crab and I love corn chowder. Was so looking forward to this soup. I am so disappointed that if I could give NO stars, I would! The first couple of bites I could taste the corn, but definitely no crab flavor. After that, the only thing I could taste was black pepper. Had to throw it out after about 6 bites because the pepper overpowered everything and started to burn my tongue! So, just a warning... this soup is NOT worth purchasing!	-1
Awful...	-1
if your expecting it to be a creamy delight like ....Clam chowder....you will be disappointed...also it had way to much corn in it... Im from Maine....does not taste like crab...strange flavor	-1
not that good	-1
Wrong soup mailed,Picture does not match chicken soup this is a corn chowder!	-1
Seafood is good fresh. Not like this...	-1
As you'd imagine anything like this that doesnt need to be refrigerated is going to be bad.	-1
Okay, I realize this is a crab chowder - but it is really fishy smelling and tasting. Bought two - threw the second one away.	-1
I was very disappointed to find that this chicken had A LOT of water or broth in it. Swimming (drowning) in it. What a waste of good metal! They could just use a smaller can, but obviously they are trying to out-compete other brands by claiming it's more chicken; when really, it appears to be just more water than ever before. There doesn't appear to be anywhere near 12 ounces of meat in it. Other than that, the chicken and the broth are good and tasty.. I just wish the FDA would get on top of this, they are not the only canned food company adding lots of fluids to and subtracting meat from canned meats and fish lately. I did take photos, will try and get them uploaded sometime soon. update- thanks for wasting my time, amazon. I DID UPLOAD PHOTOS BUT THEY DID NOT PUBLISH THEM! i guess they want the customers to be kept in the dark.	-1
Yeah, pretty gross.  I guess it's a matter of taste, but I'm not buying this again.	-1
You no that flavor you get in your mouth after you throw up well that tast better then this. DO NOT BUY ITS SUPER BAD. I called campbells to complan and they will not give a refund only a coupon to buy more soup.	-1
Very little crab and corn.  First time I'm disappointed in Campbells.	-1
Gave 2 stars because can good arrived dented.  I don't purchase or consume dented can items for health reasons and it was discarded.  However I have tasted item before and use in different recipes, enjoyed taste and texture.	-1
Err. If I'd checked the list of ingredients first, I would not have bought this.  It's reasonably edible, for a canned chicken, and if you were holed up in a nuclear bunker, you could do worse. Wait, did that sound bad? ...like I said, it's edible.  There are other, and cheaper, products where the ingredients list looks more like "chicken". Period.  This one involves chicken somewhere in the long list of ingredients.	-1
This product is a shipping and handling ripoff. The seller claims "This item is 1.98 pounds or 4.4% of a Pantry box. " One 12.5 oz net weight  can does NOT weigh TWO POUNDS and it does NOT fill  4.4%  of a a FOUR CUBIC FOOT box.  It is the same can as the 9.75oz but it is, maybe, 1/2"  taller to hold the additional 2.75 oz. ...even if it weighed one pound(16 oz) gross, it would still only be 2.1 or 2.2% of the box(like almost every other 16oz food product).  Other than that, Swanson chicken breast in a can is as probably as good as it gets for chicken _in a can_.  BTHOO the stuff they(Campbells, Progresso, ...etc.) use in soups.  I tried the normal channels to get this fixed but iguess they figure as long as you do not notice it, why bother? If they fix it, I'll amend the rating.	-1
ok if you are in a pinch but, too much salt and an aftertaste that is not to my liking	-1
Taste like chicken from a can. You cannot hide the processed taste. Two stars for an easy protein though.	-1
I will not buy canned chicken again.  I had a recipe that called for it, so I bought it with the thinking that it would be more convenient than buying and cooking a chicken.  While it was convenient, I was disappointed.  When I opened the can, it smelled like tuna.  It did not taste like tuna in the dish I made, but when my husband came home, he thought I made something with tuna because of the smell.  I also did not like the texture of the meat, and my husband commented on this as well.  While I'm sure this is a good enough brand, it's just not up to par and cannot compare with real chicken.	-1
This product tastes great but isn't what I thought it would be. Being that it is a V8 product  I assumed it would be a healthy product just like the original V8 juice. But it isn't, it has sucralose (splenda) in it which is bad for you. Why can't you use a natural sweetener like stevia to sweeten it?	-1
Terrible! Don't buy it!	-1
I love Campbell soup but this had no flavor, was greasy, and maybe six potato pieces in there	-1
Barf. The consistency is nasty and the 'bacon' is NOT bacon - I swear it's not!!!	-1
I tried this but I just didn't like it all that much.	-1
I've tried two flavor sand both left a strange after taste. There's no way to check sell by date. Not a good choice when buying pantry items.	-1
I would venture to say it's pretty hard to go so wrong with potato soup as this Slow Kettle Style does. I found it to be overly garlicky and it also had a strange taste in general and an odd smell. I couldn't finish it. Try the Slow Kettle corn and crab chowder instead.	-1
I was very unhappy with the taste of this soup.  I do like Campbell's soup and enjoy several varieties of their products.  However the slow kettle baked potato soup will not come home with me ever again.	-1
Use by date was a month old, they were stale, the dog likes them.	-1
Nasty do not recommend	-1
Was like eating tomato soup with beans.  I will not buy it again.	-1
This is fine as a chili. The sauce base is thick and has good color. The beans (which outnumber the meat by about 5:1) have a good texture and the meat tastes good.  But.  This product is not even a little bit spicy. Not even a tiny measurable amount of spiciness exists within this product. This leaves me with the question of: who is this product for? It's not for people who actually enjoy spicy foods. It's not even for people who say they like spicy foods but really just mean Taco Bell hot sauce packets. Those are spicier than this chili. So really, I'm baffled by how bland it is.  That being said, I wouldn't buy this product again. I can make spicier (and healthier) chili at home for fairly cheap. I mean, how convenient is a convenience food if it just isn't very good?	-1
Not spicy at all and pretty boring.	-1
This shouldn't even be in the chili category,mildly spicy and had a distinct ketchup based taste to it. I know in most cases chili,or hot food in general is often average tasting to allow adding stuff to make it spicier but,this wasn't very well to its described 'hot' taste at all	-1
Does not work  waste of money	-1
My family loves bacon, maple syrup on their pancakes and breakfast meat and I cannot keep enough popcorn. In stock for them. I thought this would be fun and a mix of all American things loved. However, they were not fond of this at all.  The powder flavoring was very gritty they said it was a little more smoky than expected. They used the popcorn and the movie theater butter it also comes with and skipped out on the flavoring. Maybe I'll use it on a cupcake or something. My family ages are 16 9 2 35 and 31. Not a fan. The packaging is really cute and the bucket is definitely handy to shake it all in. A cute gift but select another flavor. I'm thinking this would be an aquire taste.	-1
Normally don`t bash a product for receiving it in bad shape ,however on multiple orders over time the item has been banged up. Too many incidents of this..Whether its on Amazons end or on the part of the mfr not making a sturdy container either way,these may be good products just never know b/c they are always damaged..Think both parties should get together and address this prob	-1
Our dogs seem to like the food.  We could not put up with the nauseous gas it caused with the dogs.  We will be donating the unused cans to a shelter.	-1
Did not like at all. Has a burnt taste to it. Tossed them.	-1
not my liking but I can have glutin	-1
In my opinion, did not meet the flavor profile.  Did not taste good.  Waste of money.  However, everyone has a different taste.  I love peppery snacks, but this did not fit the bill for me.	-1
Did not like the flavor. They didn't quite taste like ginger snaps, yet the ginger burned the back of my tongue.	-1
My wife bought this for me because I was tired of Folgers, big mistake.  It  just tastes horrible.  And I can choke down just about any coffee.	-1
I don't particularly like this variety of Happy Belly coffee.  It's supposed to be a medium-dark roast, but it tastes more like generic (inexpensive) diner coffee to me.  Not horrible tasting, but nothing I would order again.	-1
This was very weak coffee. I drink very bold coffee. With the name Espresso roast I  generally expect you'll be getting a very rich bold flavor. This one is really a little mild in flavor	-1
It doesn't keep me dry like advertised	-1
What isn't ultimately apparent here in the advertising is the size of the individual packages ..... these are less than half the size you are used to seeing in the store displays ...... cheap you say? .... yes because you are getting a bunch of sample size packages ....	-1

These are gear.  Sometimes my husband takes chips to work.  Now he doesnt have to put some in bags.  He can just get and grab.  Also good for us because, you get a huge bag and, you don't really know how many servings you are eating.  They were all not expired so that is a plus.  Wood buy from seller again.  I have been meaning to recap my review for the longest time, I just haven't gotten around to it.  Ok you get what you pay for.  I bought these on sale thought it was a great product.  Until now it is April.  I bought these in January.  I am just counting everything and you were supposed to get 4 of everything.  My husband doesnt eat onion rings nor do I.  I threw away 11 bags of onion rings.  You were supposed to get 4.  Mmmmmmm something is very wrong with.  I did not get my moneys worth.  I would if better off going to the store and buying everything we needed.  Do not buy from this seller unless you like onion rings.	-1
Milk in order exploding ruining this, unable to determine quality.	-1
Sad to say but almost ALL of the bags were filled with only about 5 pieces in each. Once you popped the AIR FILLED bag and looked inside it was so DISAPPOINTING. Too upset to return or even notify Amazon. Figures it came from Mexico.	-1
They were stale.	-1
Although this is a type of item that I have purchased at the grocery store I guess I should have taken the time to read the reviews on here before ordering. The package of 32 single bags of chips arrived in good visual condition on 12/22/15 but happens to have a use by date of 1/12/16. We opened one bag of chips last night, not the freshest. I'm sure the bulk of this item will end up being fed to the birds since there is no way we will eat that amount of chips in such a short period of time.	-1
DISGUSTING! It Has NO taste and the chips are as hard as a rock. Priced at 5 dollars a bag I was expecting it to be delicious and it didn't live up to my expectation. I couldn't even get myself to eat one of these, as soon I started chewing I spit it out.	-1
It must be me.  I bought these based on the excellent reviews others gave, but I found the bars dry and the chocolate bitter.  The ingredients, I'm sure, are as healthful as the manufacturer claims.  To me these bars tasted like bad diet food.  I gave them away at work.	-1
BEWARE! These are the tiny tiny cans, and the price was that of the 12 oz cans!	-1
Some of these two-ply were off-center and one ply was bigger/smaller than the other.  You think that wouldn't have left the plant.  Makes a mess at the perforation.  They're also quite thin.	-1
Picture was totally white, but I had this colored pattern... I don't like it.	-1
I didn't see that they had print on them not to happy about I prefer white no print !!	-1
Too expensive not worth it! Too small of a roll for this price!	-1
Very poor absorption.	-1
DID NOT KNOW THESE HAD DAWN IN THEM.	-1
These are not "Bounty-quality" towels.  Thickness is reduced.  Softness is reduced.  We're paying top-dollar Bounty, stop skimping.	-1
Not the big rolls and loosely rolled.	-1
The rolls were not as Big as I thought they were going to be and I have a hard time separating the sheets when starting a new roll.	-1
was a bit upset that they were not select a size. For the price, it really was not worth it.	-1
see title	-1
Awful tasting - The cheap ramen noodles in a cup are much better.	-1
I tried this out of curiosity, and I think I'll stick with the cheap Ramen.  It has a funny plastic flavor.	-1
see title	-1
There is a disagreeable metallic taste to this soup! It was so bad I was afraid to serve it! II opened a second can and the same problem existed. I feel as though I have wasted my money! Store items do not have this problem.	-1
Normally I buy another brand but decided to go with these guys in a recent order. In short, after pouring it into a bowl just before heating it up... it just seemed like a watered down bowl of nothing.  Just very cheap looking... definitely not the "Rich & Hearty" experience i was expecting from the labeling. Didn't even waste my time heating it up. Just ended up just pouring it down the garbage disposal.	-1
Watery.  Certainly not as good as condensed, canned version.	-1
It wasn't horrible but as far as Velveeta products go this one is a dud.	-1
Not good at all.  This is the worst Knorr pasta I've ever had.	-1
I cannot imagine anyone buying this a second time. I found it repulsive just from the smell and the taste was yucky. I threw the 4 cans I purchased away. Live and learn.	-1
cans bent	-1
Asked for one order of 4 cans, received one single can instead. Tasted kinda okay, but that ended up being a very expensive can of potato soup.  Lots of potato chunks in this, but the liquid part is really soupy and there isn't a whole lot of substance beyond the potatos. I could kind of taste the bacon and cheddar, I think? Not sure if I was imagining it or not. Mostly just potato.  I'd have given it 3 stars if they didn't screw up the order.	-1
Fake bacon has a HORRIBLE taste. I cannot recommend. I would eat it again only if I had NO choice in the matter. They need to hire better taste testers.	-1
If you like potatoes, this is the soup for you. It has very little soup  or stock; it;s just big chunks of potatoes. I could not discern one scintilla of bacon or cheddar flavoring.	-1
Ordered 1 four can pack , only received 1 can .	-1
This tasted pretty fake, which was surprising for an Annie's product. I wouldn't reorder.	-1
did  not like. sorry i usually like annie's brand but this is horrible	-1
Taste like spaghetti os.  pretty gross won't buy these again.	-1
These taste good at first then you can taste a chemical taste at the end of the sip.	-1
Soaked !	-1
needs more coco.	-1
Each time I used these pods in my Kurig machine, it clogged it upl	-1
Wasn't impressed with Hazelnut and the price was a little too high for my liking.	-1
This wasn't what I expected really. It taste like they used artificial sugar in it..I was surprised because I always love these k cups. Id recommend trying one out before buying it. I even tried adding some cream and sugar to a 2nd cup to see if it would help and it didnt.	-1
Disgusting. Those who likes this had never tasted the real chain latte.	-1
Soaked !	-1
ordered by mistake for my Gaggia Espressomachine . This pots don't work for an Espresso machine .I opened the tiny pots to use at least the coffeepowder for my Gaggia. Very few coffee for a lot of money	-1
Didn't work in stove.stunk up kitchen like melted plastic	-1
Just not a fan plus its overpriced for the size. I didn't realize it was a SMALL bag	-1
YUCK!!. Didn't like the flavors- were really overpriced.	-1
Expensive. Better than potato chips but still not that good for you.	-1
Nasty tasting, too sweet, flavored or unflavored not tolerable / consumable. (Thus us coming from a person who Loves coconut) past on this one......	-1
Way too sweet Carnation Breakfast much better buy and taste.	-1
Be aware of the high sugar content.  Two days in a row, a few hours after drinking this, my digestive system has gone into an uproar. Cramping, discomfort, irritation, and feeling ill. Need to keep weight up before heart surgery, but there will have to be another way.	-1
Way too sweet! Carnation Breakfast drink a better option taste and price wise.	-1
Someone apparently went back to the 70s and found a warehouse of those giant menstrual pads that were like wearing a towel between your legs.  Then they wrapped some stuff around the top to make a stretchy waistband that is easily high enough to stick out over the top of pants.  I have selected Prevails before for the sometimes member of my household who needs them.  I don't remember any of them being of this quality.	-1
Prefer Always brand.	-1
I bought these because they seemed to advertise being soft, and they ARE, and they slowly release into the ear and that's really nice, but I have rain just outside my bedroom window that causes all sorts of pitter patters and I could still hear it close to perfectly with these in :( I would definitely recommend these if you were just trying to soften noise you wanted to hear anyway, such as maybe at a concert, but it won't destroy it, which is what I wanted them for... because I wanted to sleep... because it's called dreamgirl.	-1
Wasn't crazy about the taste and each time I received the package it was melted so won't be buying again.	-1
Dry.	-1
tastes horrible	-1
It sucks! Absolutely sucks! It tastes bad, doesn't spread, even when warm. Don't buy this garbage, it totally sucks. Puke in a jar!	-1
No way to spread this. Just a dry clumpy mess. Disgusting	-1
Not the tast I was looking for.	-1
I wanted to like this as it was the only "natural" gum I could find.  It looses it's sweetness in about a minute and then you are left chewing this very pepperminty blob, not good.	-1
just does not taste good and kids won't eat it	-1
The turkey stick tasted spoiled.  Would not buy this again.	-1
Blah taste,. way overpriced.	-1
Disappointed that there was very little hummus inside. Mostly other junk foods masked as healthy.	-1
this product is terrible, going to throw it out, guess I didn't read the label or the info was not as complete as it should be	-1
The unpleasant odor even after rinsing and cooking is unappealing.	-1
I did not like these. The taste was not worth the calories. Not very cheesy and the texture was unpleasant. Maybe it is all the artificial flavors... plus there's a lot of junk in these including a lot of artificial flavors and colors, as well as preservatives and MSG.	-1
These are not very good.  Not cheesy enough	-1
Tried these because my family likes the peanut butter crackers from this brand, but no one likes them. I don't find the flavor appealing, either, but I'm not a huge jalapeo fan. They did ship on time and arrive undamaged.	-1
No licorice aroma or taste; I didn't steep it for 12 min, but that's a bit much in my case. Way too sweet, and unpleasant after taste. Good luck!	-1
Body was thin, the flavor has a slight chemical tasting component reminiscent of cooked onions and the acidity was very high.	-1
NO	-1
Great tasting chips but wayyyyyy to expensive for the amount you get. Arrived in good condition, No broken up or crushed as stated in other reviews. Will not purchase again due to cost.	-1
The 6 packages inside the main cardboard box are simple silver wrappers.  I really wanted to like these cookies. I used to occasionally get these cookies (I think this same brand, just smaller packages) at a gas station during my work lunch break at an old job. I was hoping to recapture that taste. Unfortunately, these cookies have a very strong aftertaste--plus, the aftertaste starts so quickly, you don't have much time to taste/enjoy the actual flavor. The aftertaste is like a wax, and it just coats the roof of my mouth.	-1
Expired 1 day after they arrived. Didn't notice until a week later.	-1
not so good	-1
Way too sweet, doesn't taste natural sweet.	-1
Box crashed by hash can	-1
Just didn't care for it	-1
Bag of sauce	-1
It isn't totally misleading the small print does tell you to add your own pork. There is no way I would spend $3.00 + for 6 oz of bbq sauce. I was expecting 6 oz of a finished product which would make 2 decent sandwiches, or 4 skimpy ones. Which would be a fair price for this item. I don't know how much pork you are supposed to add. I don't understand why I didn't read any negative product reviews stating the misleading  representation of this item. This isn't BBQ Pulled Pork It is BBQ  SAUCE for Pulled Pork There is no pork in this package.	-1
Very disappointing,  it loses it flavor if sprinkled in hot soups or on any hot food.  Works great on a cold sald our cold sandwich, BUT FORGET ABOUT USING IT ON ANY THING HOT.  I SPRINKLE IT ON BAKED POTATOES AND THE BACON BIT ON THE COLD SOUR CREAM HAD FLAVOR. THOSE THAT WERE ON THE HOT POTATOES HAD NONE. AND THE BACON BIT TURNED TO MUSH !	-1
Not good tasting	-1
This has sesame paste in it's sauce. I am severely allergic to sesame anything! I will give these to my friend, he will enjoy it. I don't like products that hide ingredients. Please, clearly list that this is a Peanut & Sesame paste noodle! I'm happy I carefully read the ingredients on the back of this product!	-1
It has a sour after taste. Maybe skip the sauce. Also the bowl arrived broken and i had to put it in amother container. Luckily still edible since the noodles and toppings are in sealed packages.	-1
Packaged noodles smell like play-doh and possibly tastes what play-doh would taste like if I were to eat it. Which I won't do.	-1
