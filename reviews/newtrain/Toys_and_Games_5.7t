We got this for our two year old, who'd asked for a trampoline for Christmas. Since they are so unsafe, we decided on a bouncer instead. The walls make it much safer for the kids to jump, and the castle theme fits into our Disney Princess playroom. It sets up in just a few minutes. We used a manual pump that also inflates our kiddie pool in the summer - you do NOT need an electric pump for this bouncer!  The girls' playmates LOVE coming to our house to jump. The only negative thing I can say about it is this - I wish it had a higher weight limit so I could jump too (although my kids and their friends have more than once exceeded the 120 lb/2 kids max rule, and we've had no problems). The bouncer came wrapped in white paper, so the kids had no idea what was inside. I really appreciated this, as it was a gift from the man in red.	1
I can't say enough great things about this jumper.  It is a little large for the standard sized living room, but not overwhelming.  The walls of this unit will cave in if your child runs into them, but they don't cave out when they lean on them from the inside.  My two toddlers bounce themselves silly in this thing, they love it, which means I absolutely love it as well.  This jumper should come standard with any child who loves to jump around.	1
My daughter (2 almost 3) received this for Christmas Eve and we pumped it up immediately (with a shop vacuum with a plastic bottle put over the hose and an electric pump nozzle to make it fit in the holes) and it is still going strong.  Both she and her 4 1/2 year old sister bounce in it, and on it.  The turrets make excellent catabaults to send the balls sailing in or over the castle.  I read all the reviews before I purchased this, and was prepared for this toy to break the day we pumped it up, but here it is over a week later and it is still going strong, and so are my girls!	1
I bought this for my 22month old son a few months ago thought it would help with his urge to climb on things and jump off He acually doesn't really know how to jump very well. But he just won't even play with it. I also thought it would be a good idea for the winter months in Wisconsin but he doesn't like to stay in it. I thought it would be good to go in his room but waaaay too big so it's in our basement never getting played with he just ignores it. dissapointing. He does like his smaller ball pit in his room that had 300 balls in it. I don't know maybe if we put it outside in the summer he'll play with it more we'll see.	1
The best I could find of the choices. I'd used The Bug House for years; mesh, metal top & bottom, plastic twig set in Plaster in bottom, easy to lift lid, catch bug/release bug. This one has a screw top, so it is more secure but fairly easy to remove/replace, good visibility but nothing for insect to climb (not twig nor side mesh). The plastic preying mantis is just sales decor. A decent product.	1
My kids love them and the lids are easy for them to get off.	1
screen ripped in one day of use.	-1
My 3 year old loves it! It was time for something a little bigger and this is perfect. We have a catipillar in it right now and there is plenty of room for it to change into a butterfly (if it makes it that long....) The lid fits securely and the plastic doesn't feel cheap or breakable.	1
I absolutely love these! They're a great size for little kids...wider than I expected,  but the perfect size. I was pleasantly surprised.  I personalized these with sticker names and handed them out as party favors at my little girl's bday party. I had the kids dig for plastic bugs out of a bin, and these were used to collect their findings. The lid screws on well and the handle seems nice and sturdy.	1
Excellent!	1
Great Price - Good quality and Amazon got it here ahead of time as usual Brian Cianfrani	1
My Granddaughter absolutely loves it. She is 7 years old and has put anything from frogs to Japanese Beetles in it !!	1
this is perfect for the little collector.  my grandson is 5 & it is easy to use & VERY  durable	1
I bought two of these, one is perfect the other the screen at the top came off.  Not sure if it's the product (probably not) or my kids (bingo).  Great product.	1
Excellent jar for bugs.....great size and I just love, love, love the little screen on the top.  Excellent to have the top as a screw on top.  My little three year old cannot unscrew it, yet.  I know whatever the bugs we collect, the jar is safe and I thank you all.	1
This is a great little bug jar, just big enough for little hands to hold while searching for their treasures.	1
We received this as a gift for a 1 year old.  It's ok, but not entertaining enough.  I found it more helpful, using the Let's get busy, baby booklet as a teaching guide.  I would get the book and my daughter and I would look for her head, toes on the picture and find them on her body.  The cartridge is ok, but takes time and my daughter loves hitting the button to turn it off all the time.  Design is wrong, on and off button should be on side of product.  I think she will enjoy it when she's 2 1/2 or 3.  But, not at 2.	1
Althought the little touch books aren't that durable, this is a good one for the younger set.  My 15 month old son likes looking at the baby faces.  He really only likes one page so far that shows babies emotions, but that's ok.  He isn't really interested in too many of the other little touch books, so one page is ok.	1
I love the book and the way it reads to you, but the age group is off. at 6 months and now at 14 months my son just trys to tear it up. he does love the noices though. maybe he will be ready for it a little later on.	1
I purchased the Little Touch system along with the other books for my 11 mos. old daughter.  While she is not yet interested in the other books, she LOVES this one.  I think the pictures of real life babies and real objects are more appealing to her than the animation art in the other books.  She claps, dances, etc. along with the babies in the book.  Though she is too young to "push" on the pages to activate them, I push on the objects she reaches toward.  I would encourage anyone who purchased the Little Touch for an infant or young toddler to try this book before giving up and putting the toy aside.  This is the Little Touch book for little ones!	1
Our 14 mo. old daughter received this as a gift.  It was a waste of money- the buttons are so hard to push that she can't operate the doll without adult assistance.  It doesn't really doesn't do much except sing a couple of songs- one of our least favorite toys she has!	-1
This is a tricky puzzle, even for me.  I think it may have been too hard for my preschooler, but it is something we can work on together.	1
I love LeapFrog!!  Fun and educational.  I give this as a gift for little ones.  Great introduction to english and spanish.  Wonderful learning.  Lily is also cuddly as her inner computer is padded very well.  Girls love her.	1
we loved the baby hug n learn tad, and bought this item for a birthday gift and was very disappointed.  it doesnt light up like the baby tad.  and the buttons are more difficult to press and it is not musical.	-1
My 2 year-old daughter received this toy for her 2nd birthday.  She was so excited about it and played with it for all of an hour.  That was a month and a half ago and Lily hasn't been played with since.  She really doesn't do much.  She only sings two songs!  Really, really boring toy.	-1
Love it	1
Wow! My 3.5 grandson had this done in a flash. It was so exciting for him to see the fish come to life.  He spent much time admiring the picture and going over all the mammals in the picture.  Introduce you child first to the 50 piece puzzles by Melissa & Doug first, then this one is a snap.	1
Puzzles are a classic way to keep kids occupied. Makes a nice inexpensive gift. So many options to choose from that its easy to please everyone from kids to adults.	1
Great	1
high quality puzzle.	1
Great fairly challenging 100 piece puzzle.	1
Fun	1
good quality	1
Not too childish for senior adults yet a nicely manageable size and pieces.	1
We love puzzles and this was perfect for my 4-7yr old kids.	1
A fun puzzle and a joy to construct.	1
6 year old loves it.	1
These are good puzzles.  I bought multiple puzzles for my 7 year old son for Christmas and he loves them. They are challenging enough that it takes him a little while to put together, but not hard enough where he's spending days doing them. They are fun for me to do, too!	1
Filler word because I have to.	1
Purchased for our nephew for Christmas. Arrived quickly. Can't speak on its contents since it's a gift but the price was good and the picture looks like it will be a nice one for him to put together :)	1
good	1
grandkids love it...ages 9 and 11	1
Hard to see the picture on cover because of the tail portion of the shark being covered! Otherwise my 5 yr old son loved it!	1
It doesn't say what size the puzzle pieces are. I wanted something small and got Huge pieces.	-1
These Melissa & Doug puzzles are just great.  My kids love them.  The pieces don't feel like cut out paper (which I hate); they feel sturdy.  I can feel confident about my kids doing these puzzles again and again.  The picture looks crystal clear and my kids love it.	1
3 yr old daughter did this puzzle in 20 minutes. Loved it, but I thought it would be more of a challenge for her. She's just really good at puzzles.	1
Great puzzle for my 6 year old - needs adult help to put together because a little more challenging with all of the blue going on.  Was fun to piece together.	1
My 6 year old loves this!!!!  Puts it together all by himself now.	1
Grandson loves the puzzel.	1
I am always looking for things to occupy my mother. She likes puzzles but her dementia is progressing so the 1000 piece puzzles are beyond her skills. This one was a bit too easy but she enjoyed it. Finished it in one day so now I need another. I'd guess 8-10 age appropriate so this will go to a grandchild. Sure wish someone made them a little bit harder than this!	1
if your child loves sharks, than this is the puzzle for him/her!  great photo.  sturdy puzzle pieces.  great for one-on-one time with your child	1
I think the quality of this puzzle is great, but compared to other puzzles I have, this one doesn't seem to keep the interest of anyone quite as long.  I do wish it had more color and variety of ocean life.  But it's for a child that loves sharks, I think it's a great puzzle.	1
I bought this puzzle for my six year old son who loves puzzles, especially making them with his dad.  The quality of materials and the colors in this puzzles are great, this puzzle being underwater made it a little more of a challenge, which we both enjoyed.	1
I'm a special education teacher and I wanted puzzles that were fewer pieces yet interesting and challenging for my kids. These are perfect. Heavy pieces, yet intricate enough to challenge my special needs kids. They love the graphics on box and puzzle even more when put together.	1
Love the color and shark.  My grandson is all about sharks, Melissa  and Doug Puzzles are always great products,  you can't go wrong.	1
It is a well made challenging puzzle for a child of six years old. The challenge becomes less after the 5 th time of putting it together. Overall it's a good product.	1
Quality Melissa and Doug puzzle. Sturdy construction. Great, clear graphics. Brilliant colors are true to the illustration and product description.	1
Bought for a 5 year old loves puzzles and sharks. Melissa and Doug have great products. This was a big hit	1
This is a great puzzle.  My son loves sharks and the ocean so he really enjoyed doing this puzzle.  It is a great puzzle to do with your child as it is a little more challenging for my 6 year old.	1
Great puzzle, it is little advance for my son but he enjoyed working on it with a little help. Pieces are strong and they fit nicely .With this prize , it is a great buy.	1
Was a gift for my son and he loved it. He is so into sharks and this was the best gift ever.	1
I purchased this puzzle for my 4 year old grandson that has been putting 70+ piece puzzles together without a problem.  It is a beautiful puzzle and the quality is far and above most puzzles we have been buying.  I think because of the colors in this puzzle it has been more difficult for him but he loves working on it and has put it together a couple of times.  We have a table set up for him and he will work on a puzzle for more than an hour at a time; he leaves it to play with other toys but will return and work on it for another hour.	1
My daughter is on a shark frenzy.  Everything has to be a shark.  One item that I bought her for Christmas is this puzzle by Melissa and Doug of a majestic (but, for me, paralyzingly terrifying) shark surrounded by some little sea life in what looks like a reef, all held, presumably, in an aquarium.  It contains 100 pieces, so the pieces are large enough for fine motor coordination of an older elementary aged child.  It is sufficiently diverse figure - ground so that children can perceptually analyze and assemble a gestalt.  Other than than the scary shark (sharks and snakes do it to me  :(  ) I believe that this image is very attractive.  As an adult, I'm not THE best puzzle assembler, but, this one provides some challenge.  I believe that this puzzle provides educational values - visual problem solving, fine motor coordination, viewing the small problem while also maintaining sight on the whole, how to attack a problem (corners, edges ...), and then, of course, all of the diversity of species, how they interact in nature, and how we set up tanks for the mutual benefit of the selection of species.  There are so many avenues of discussion for parents and children that this alone can become a half-day's event.  Now, I bring the internet with me everywhere, so I'm better prepared for those difficult questions.  I believe that the puzzle pieces are clearly cut out and they fit snuggly together.  It seems to be produced by quality craftsmanship using quality materials.  I believe that it is quite durable, although a puzzle and an energetic little girl can lead to a lost piece, usually in the middle of the puzzle!  I recommend this puzzle for curators of marine institutes, children's museums, science museums, aquariums, libraries - both public and school, as well as home enthusiasts.  For folks intrigued and not frightened by sharks, this is an excellent purchase.  I give everything a grade, and this puzzle I believe is overall worth an "A-".	1
While I Love the butterfly kit wherein you can see eggs to caterpillars to chrysalis to butterfly, children need to TOUCH things.  Of course, they can't touch the live critters.  That's where this product comes in.  It compliments the kit and allows a hands-on experience for the little ones.	1
I really debated buying these models.  I was teaching my 2 year old about the butterfly life cycle and thought these would help me explain it, but honestly wasn't sure if she'd get it or even care about it.  Let me say, this was the greatest couple bucks I've ever spent on a teaching tool.  My daughter (26 month old) is FASCINATED with these figurines.  I used them to explain caterpillars and butterflies to her and she totally understood it right away.  All week she has been using the models to explain the butterfly cycle TO US.  Her new favorite phrase is, "caterpillar... make a chrysalis!"  She loves them.  She even insisted we bring them out to dinner with us one night.  The only unfortunate thing is she played with them so much this week, somehow the egg has gone missing.  We spent 2 hours tearing apart the house the other night looking for that darn egg.  No dice.  Such a bummer.  But it's such a nice set I have actually considered buying it all over again just to get another egg for her.  I also want to add, I grabbed these models at the same time that I placed an order for live caterpillars from the same company.  I highly recommend getting them both together.  It's one thing to see the models, but another to actually watch the caterpillars transform in front of your eyes.	1
Perfect for my Classroom!	1
Good but didn't tell any information on the back like safari did!	1
A perfect way to let my homeschooled daughter see the stages of the life cycle of a butterfly. She loved it. It was very well made,and perfect for science.	1
I like this set of life stages. I haven't taken it out of the packaging yet, it's easier to display when it kept mint	1
Worked great for teaching my preschool class.	1
I understand the concept, but it wasn't the young ones who used them as finger crayons.  My 3 year old liked to put them on her finger, the 1 year old just used them like a crayon.  But they work and they stack, so you gotta love that.	1
Weak coloring and fragile. The color is really faint, so no coloring on ol DDD paper shopping bags. We have broke half of them from falling on the floor	-1
however my children just like to stack them up instead of doodle with them. Well made but this is more for toddler	1
My daughter (11 months) absolutely thinks these are great.  She tries to color with them and they are actually pretty easy to transfer onto paper unlike reviews I read for other styles.  Will definitely be getting more for when these are too small.	1
Great Quality Great Product	1
This is exactly what it looks like. I used them with some Montessori cards I printed out and laminated. The kids were able to match and sort and order with these life cycle stages.	1
I am a first grade teacher, my kiddos love these! They are durable enough to have the students play with them and I don't have to worry about them getting broken! Well worth the money I spent!	1
Bad quality...	-1
I didn't even bother buying my toddler regular crayons...I knew they would be snapped in half pronto, and then you're left with snack-sized bits of wax - never a good thing.  I finally found these and they're PERFECT!  Much harder than regular crayons, so they don't break as easily (and I found another bonus to be that if your kid decides to color on something other than paper, the harder wax of these crayons doesn't transfer as easily and is easier to remove).  They double as a stacking toy, as well.  My daughter has already been through 1 set and is working on the second.  I gave these to her at 1 1/2 with no problems, and now that's she's 2 coloring is one of her favorite things to do.  There's a 30-crayon set available too - that will be my next purchase!&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Alex-Finger-Crayons-30-Pieces/dp/B000BR67JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Alex Finger Crayons - 30 Pieces</a>	1
My granddaughter liked it better than the 'Star Crayon in the Tub."  It's basically stiff wax in an easy shape for a toddler to hold.	1
You kind of have to press hard with some colors to get anything to show up. Overall, much better than the big crayons for small hands. They hold up much better to being bitten.	1
These are great! My son first looked at them like they were crazy and wasn't sure of them. Within minutes though, he was coloring away! And holding them the way they were designed. These are a great alternative crayon for your little one.	1
I got these for my 19 month old son and turns out he loves to stack them more than he likes to color with them (well, at his age it's scribbling!). He can sit and stack and unstack and restack and rearrange and stack and unstack and restack these crayons for a good 20-30 minutes! They're perfect for use in his high chair while we make and/or eat dinner. They are the perfect size for his little hands. He did bite the tip off one when we weren't paying attention, but so far it's only been that one so I figure we're doing pretty good  Edited a few months later to add that we now have two broken crayons--surprisingly they survived a few drops off the high chair [onto a wood floor] during use, but then I dropped the bag once (I keep them in a ziploc) and one broke into about three pieces! When the tip breaks off, they can still use them...but it just feels like when a middle piece of the round part breaks (think a piece of the pie), they become more fragile and easier for little hands to break, so I ended up taking that crayon away for now. That said, I still like these enough that I am buying the bigger set.	1
Shows clearly the life cycle of a butterfly.  Great for use in a classroom	1
Great learning tool to reinforce Life Cycles. They are small for little hands to handle. They are a tough plastic that can withstand a lot of handling. Would be great for a kids who likes animals. Would also be great in a classroom setting.	1
I added this to our week learning about butterflies (which really was two weeks, one week as caterpillars the other as butterflies). These tangible representations really helped the kids learn the life cycle. By the end of the first week all three kids (4, 2, & 2 yr old) knew the life cycle of the butterfly! They could put it in order and knew the names of each stage. I also ordered the live butterfly kit from Insect Lore, and a book on here about the life cycle (plus books from the library). Last week we learned about Frogs, and since they also make the life cycle of the frog similar to this I ordered it. The tangible objects really help reinforce the names and stages.	1
Insect Lore always has great products and this one is no exception.  This will be a great visual when we do our unit on caterpillars and butterflies.	1
We homeschool and are currently studying insects.  This is a perfect visual learning tool that shows the stages of the butterfly.  Very realistic looking.	1
Students love all of the new things we implement in the classroom setting.  We love watching the students reactions as they discover new items throughout the classroom	1
We got this at our house for our homeschool units on butterflies and life cycles.  The pieces are sturdy and durable!  My children are 5, 3 and 1 and they all enjoyed playing with the toys.  The older kids enjoyed putting them in order of stages and my 1 year old had fun just playing with the pieces.  I strongly recommend these for educational use as well as just something fun for a kid to play with!!	1
These are very well made - the kids love them.  The butterfly egg and caterpillar are enormous compared to the real things.	1
Good quality pieces and educational. My wife is a teacher and uses these in class during science time to give a hands on experience to the stages of a butterfly.	1
Great learning tool - they are sturdy, clear and work great for teaching about the metamorphosis of a butterfly! We put it in a clear container and showed the stages for our two year old class!	1
I work at a school and I got this for the science teacher, who loves teaching life cycles and animal life to our kindergarteners. She loved them, they are realistic but not creepy, they are great for educational purposes, their size is also pretty nice, fitting in your palm but big enough to have detail.	1
My 4-year-old granddaughter takes after her father, a research scientist. She likes to read about things, but likes to be hands on even more. This set allowed her to hold and inspect the different life cycle stages without injuring a live insect.  It follows closely with the book about Butterfly life cycles.	1
A happy customer in Hawaii!  I bought these for my son's preschool for their science table.  The kids really enjoyed it.	1
This is a great product for teachers. I teach Special Ed and the characters can be used for sequencing, word reminders and learning letter sounds C,  ad E. Of course, it is also a great way to explain what is going to happen next with our classroom butterflies. The kids love them.	1
This book was well received by preschoolers through second grade; and I am sure it could be used in even higher grades. I used it along with the Insect Lore Butterfly Life Cycle Stages "toy" also sold by Amazon. Used together they made an excellent tool for teaching metamorphosis to the age group I had. I liked it so much I ordered more books and "Life Cycle Stages" bugs for additional lessons.	1
I bought one each of these for my two boys. They really loved this product. It was easy to put on and simple for them to open and close themselves (they were 5 and 4 at time of purchase) Many a bug were caught throughout last spring and summer. I will definitely purchase another pair of them when these break or wear out.	1
Who doesn't want to wear an accessory that will hold your bugs for you and free up your hands for more bug catching???!!  My two year old son is obsessed with bugs.  If there is a toy, book, or outfit that involves bugs, we probably own it.  This summer he really got into catching any insect or arachnid he could find.  It was a little disconcerting for me (I'm not used to catching/carrying around insects... crazy I know), but he loves finding/catching them.  When I found the WATCH A BUG by Insect Lore, I thought it would be perfect for my little guy.  I actually bought two thinking that one would probably break (he's hard on stuff) and I was anticipating his sadness if that happened.  However, the watch seemed pretty durable and after a month he found the second one.  So he now plays with both of them and (4 months later) they have held up really well.  In addition to being able to carry real insects in them, they also come with a toy insect inside.  One of his watches came with a little green tick and the other had a colorful dragonfly.  I figured he would lose the toy insects right away because they are so small, but he loves them and always keeps track of where they are.  These watches were a huge hit and I'm sure I'll buy more in the future for other children.	1
my granddaughter loves these she wears it outside and looks for a buy and sits and gives it a name and talks to them like a pet *LOL*	1
We have yet to try collecting a live bug in this "Watch", but am anticipating a success. I panic every time I hand a bug to my 2 year old grandson as he likes to thoroughly examine things. I like the idea of giving the bugs safety from his inquiring hands.	1
This is a cute little product to allow a little one to keep a but with them for observation for a little while. It was a nice addition for my twins' Easter baskets. One of them kept having the lid snap off, but we were able to snap it back on easily, not sure if it was just rough playing though.	1
I bought this as a gift for my nephew and haven't given it to him yet but he will be four in December of 2013 and loves bugs so I'm thinking this will be very cool for him to have one on his wrist.	1
my 3 yr old nephew loves it. good for going to the park. he can open it and put a bug in, leave it, let it out a few steps away. really cute. bigger than I thought. def great child bug enthusiast gift.	1
My kids liked the watch.  Both my 5 year old and 2 year old.  I would recommend to a friend.	1
I bought this for my bug obsessed 3 yr old and he thinks its amazing. Just don't forget about the bug when it gets put down. He's had moths, ants, and flies in his. I think he ends up squishing them slightly with his fingers and throwing it in the container. I think it's nice. The top lid opens up. Stick the bug in and it snaps shut. The bugs are pretty easy to see through the mesh too. It's not huge. It also has one of those cheapy plastic wrist bands that's adjustable. So far it's held up. But I've only had it a month. :)	1
My Daughter loves this toy!  She takes it everywhere looking for ladybugs and roly pollys. Thank you! Hopefully she won't take them in her room and save them LOL!	1
Enjoy!	1
My daughter really likes this.  All of our baby lady bugs are crawling around right now	1
I bought these for a couple of 4 year old boys who love to collect all things creepy crawly.  Only thing is that the poor little insects often receive a bit too much loving while being clamped in their small, moist hands.  This frequently turns out to be an unfortunate end for the bugs and results in heartbroken little guys who were trying to be gentle with their new buggy friends.  The wrist habitat offers the insect a semi-safe spot to be viewed and "befriended" by little folk.  It also gives an opportunity for parents to instill some early compassion in their children; such as, "Honey, I think that Calvin the Cricket has ridden around long enough now and would probably like to go home to see his family.  Maybe another bug can take a turn for a bit."  After one or two of these suggestions, I've noticed that the kids become very conscientious about returning their bugs to the spot where they were originally found.  So, all in all, a fun accessory to observe bugs; but also an opportunity for the little ones to think things through and learn about other living creatures around them.	1
OK the kid likes bugs, and I don't.  So what, so I got this wrist watch holder for her.  So she uses it to hold the bugs she captures, until she gets them in the house, takes them out of her "watch" and they either are dead by then, or escape!	1
I bought this aswellas the Bug Book and Bug Cup for a 7 year old boy.  He loves all these items.  He uses them together and it gets him outside instead of playing video games inside.  I highly recommend	1
Purchased this for my son's christmas stocking.  He loves to find bugs and put them in here or just use the fake one for pretend play.  I think this will be great when we go on hiking trips!	1
they didn't all morf	1
This is perfect for our homeschooling family! We had to order the ladybugs separately with a voucher. The habitat is great quality. The larvae arrived alive and we watched them transform into ladybugs. Great learning experience.	1
Bought this for my granddaughter's 8th birthday and she was absolutely thrilled with it. The whole family got involved with the process. Wonderful and fun learning tool. About 4 or 5 didn't make it. Definitely would recommend this kit to others.	1
We currently have the larvae in the container right now. I love the little set up and there were so many ladybugs sent in the little vial. Over 20. Its neat watching my kiddo take care of these guys daily.	1
Be aware that this piece of $20 plastic does not actually come with free larvae. One you get your piece of plastic you get a voucher to order free larvae that you have to pay $8 to have shipped to you. Not impressed!	-1
My kids loved this and we'll be using it again this season.  Your first batch of bugs is included with the kit and future batches aren't expensive.  The 360 view made it easy to see the larvae and ladybugs anywhere they went in the tank and the whole dome comes off when it's time to set them free/clean it.  I bought the book "a ladybug's life" to go with it and turned it into a fun educational experience.	1
Great kit.  Larvae came with it.  So far we have TWENTY ladybugs!  That was unexpected and awesome.  So so fun!	1
My kids loved this and the lady bugs are easy to take care of!	1
Neat to see the ladybug process. A little more involved than the butterfly kit and not quite as exciting for the kids.	1
This item arrived quickly and was full of wiggly little larvae.  My children enjoyed putting the larvae in the dome and carefully watching them eat and move about.  When the larvae curled up, the children were sure they had died and then suddenly, we saw ladybugs!  What a fun experience and learning environment.	1
Exactly as described.  We ordered a book and a puzzle to get her really interested in lady bugs and their life cycle, then had this arrive a few weeks later.  We really enjoyed watching them grow and go through their stages.  Then we released them in our garden in the evening.  Now every time we see a lady bug in our garden we say it's one of ours :)  We cleaned it and put it away, and will probably order more larva for next year too!	1
My students loved this.	1
So much fun for my 5yr old.  It took 1-1 1/2 weeks to form ladybugs.  Very simple instructions, easy to care for, and great customer service.  The first batch arrived dead, but they replaced them quickly.  Great educational fun.	1
Aside from the mold that grows on the red felt during the first week of usage, which doesn't want to wash off, this item is awesome. It provides a sturdy base to hold sugar water which is great in a classroom with 27 man-handling students.	1
worked great butterflies were so pretty that came.  My kids loved it also	1
My kids love spring for two reasons - birds and butterflies. We have 3 bird feeders and a flower garden that hosts Monarch butterflies in the Spring. We love watching them and the colors of the butterflies. This was so fun to get! The kids wanted to put it out right then. The nectar is easy to make and the feeder is easy to hang. We keep an eye on it throughout the day and watch the butterflies. It is lightweight so wind can knock it off fairly easily. I received this at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion.	1
This is really cool. I love butterflies and have always wanted to attract them to my yard, but I am not good at getting flowers to grow. This is a nice little butterfly feeder. It is made of hard durable plastic and from a distance the flowers look colorful and should attract butterflies. There is a reservoir that gets filled up with the nectar. On the top, in the center of the flowers are round felt pieces that absorb the nectar and the butterflies can eat from the felt. It is a really simple idea. I have been to a butterfly house where they have cotton swabs dipped in nectar to hand feed the butterflies. On the top of feeder is a handle that can be used to hang the feeder up. I set mine outside my window so I can keep an eye on it to watch for butterflies. There is a recipe on the packaging for making the nectar out of sugar and water. This is good for kids to watch and see how butterflies eat and what kinds there are. I received this item at a discounted rate to try in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.	1
This is a nice little butterfly feeder. It has very bright colors which should attract the butterflies I haven't seen any yet but I am not watching 24 hours either I have seen them flying around it though. My son thinks it is great. After opening get a thin rope or string to go through and hang. We hung ours from the flag pole in yard. I will say that the reservoir leaked some but I was outside filling it so it went to ground. Other than that it seems to work fine. It has the directions on the box to make the nectar so that was good. I did keep the extra nectar in the fridge like it says and when I need to refill I just take it out and fill it outside. It has a cute little topper to go over the reservoir in the shape of the butterfly. I am excited to see when the butterflies come and feed from it. I was able to get this Butterfly Feeder Kit at a discounted price to review and to leave my honest opinion.	1
My eight-year-old niece and six-year-old nephew loved it! I also got them The Ladybug's Life! They loved it!	1
These are so so so cool! I've done caterpillars- butterfly's twice and I love it (as do my children and daycare kids). These are even a little more cool in my opinion. Very awesome! Def buying again!	1
My first order of Ladybug larvae was about 10 years ago for my own children. Now, I've been ordering every year for my Kindergarteners and have enjoyed watching them myself. Great addition to caterpillars!	1
We could not keep the nectar from dripping out.  Was a waste of money.	-1
We have never ever seen a single butterfly or hummingbird (description says it might even attract those) come to our feeders.  We were super excited about these as we raise Painted Lady butterflies by Insect Lore (successfully!) and release them in our yard.  There are other butterflies around as well.  We bought three of these anticipating how neat it would be to see them stop for nectar.  But it's never happened :(  We'll keep trying but we'll also be looking for other feeders that might be better.	-1
Cute design to have in garden. Is a bit flimsy so not sure how long it will hold up.	1
Looks good but no Butterflies yet.	1
Love this company and their products. My niece loved watching the ladybug life cycle as it happened	1
Butterflies love it :)	1
The butterflies use it.	1
All our lady bugs arrived dead. My daughter is so very sad as this was her birthday gift. I have contacted the company and hope they will stand by their guarantee.	-1
The descripton promised a voucher for the ladybugs. Nowhere does it say that they cost $8. Voucher implies that they are covered. My daughter bought this as a birthday present for a friend and now we cannot use it as such. Who wants a gift that costs money?	-1
My preschool and kindergarten students have so much fun with this every year!  I highly recommend for Classrooms and at home!  Even as an adult I am enthralled every time!	1
When the ladybugs arrived, most of the bugs were dead.  The ones that were not dead, died the VERY NEXT DAY.  My son was devastated.	-1
My daughter loved this	1
Wow! It's beautiful!! Every single lady bug is alive. I believe all 10 of them. My grandkids are really enjoying this.	1
EXCELLENT KIT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.  LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR INSECT WORLD. RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANY OCCASION.	1
A+	1
This exceeded my expectations for my kids. I had no idea about how ladybugs became ladybugs. I learned so much right along with my kids and setting them free was magical for the 3 of us to share together. A very low maintenance process as well.	1
My 4 year old loved this. We had so much fun watching them grow and releasing them	1
We had so much fun with this!!!!!  It comes with everything you need to take care of the crew embrace hands on learning.  We had to take a trip across the state, 8 hours in a car.  We had a lot of survivors and enjoyed releasing our lady bugs.	1
Didn't know once you got it you had to pay MORE money to have the ladybugs shipped.  Too much work since tve certificate # didn't work without my calling them and with the added expense, not worth it.	-1
This was so much fun.  We did this as a science project and I have to admit it was a blast.  It was a great learning experience as well as so easy to take care of.	1
Thanks!	1
Daycare children loves this item	1
They all lived even being delivered in the Texas heat but they did not look like the little red ladybugs I was expecting. More rust colored little beetles.	1
This came with everything it said it would, and all larva were intact and alive! It's great and I wouldn't hesitate to order again. The little window in the top of the bubble was difficult to open. I thought we might break it! But it finally popped open and all worked great!!  edited: well our larva all died :( but it was still fun trying. I'll order replacement larva sometime and try again.	1
this is a great learning experiance! my son loved watching them turn from worms to lady bugs then letting them go.	1
3.5 yr old loved it! It look a while for the larve to turn into ladybugs and we only ended up with about 5 live bugs in the end, but my daughter was completely entertained and it was definitely educational. Every time we see a lady bug in the backyard she things it was one we released from the ladybug house. She still plays with the house and puts various bugs in it that she finds in the yard	1
perfect	1
Cheaply made and most likely will not be able to reuse. The sponge at the top of this ended up molding while most of our ladybugs were still in the pupa stage so we had to be very quick once they became ladybugs to release them.  It was a fun project to do with my toddler; however, we did have to use the guarantee since most of our larva arrived dead initially.  Would possibly do this again if I could get a really good deal on a new Ladybug Land; however, definitely too pricey to buy a new one plus pay an additional $5 to ship the ladybugs every single time we want to raise ladybugs again.	-1
Our 5 year old grandson loved this. A great learning experience.	1
I got this for my 2 year old son. We both LOVED it! We had no idea what ladybugs looked like in their pupae stage! It was so much fun watching the whole process. We also had a blast releasing them into our garden. They are a different variety than the ones that are in our area.  Now we find ladybug pupae in our garden all the time (and know what they are!). So much fun for any child that enjoys bugs!	1
Wonderful gift for my 11 year old niece.  She is having a blast with it.	1
This is the third one I've purchased; it is always a special treat for a classroom!!!	1
Amazing! It was so fun to watch the lady bugs grow and my daughter loved letting them go.  Can't wait to do it again.	1
What a fun project!!! Please, convince your little one to let the ladybugs go live in nature as soon as they start moving a lot. My little one was NOT interested in the 'release' and sadly-we 'lost' a few. Finally-she agreed, and now we are helping the garden! Will repurchase.	1
Very nice item to show children how Ladybugs grow and then they release them outside.	1
We were so sad that these all died after waiting anxiously and patiently. We also had an issue with a few getting out through the cracks on the bottom of the dome. We pressed down firmly, but we would still find them outside the dome and have to put them back in through the little top piece. Finally, they all died. :(	-1
So cool to watch the eggs turn to ladybugs. The kids loved it!	1
Oh my gosh, my 4 year old grand daughter loved this!  She wanted me to come over on a daily basis to see the progress.  When they set the butterflies free, she was tickled pink!	1
Bought this item as a birthday gift for my daughter. She absolutely LOVES it!  The only downside to Ladybug Land is the fact that once the ladybugs are fully grown/mature, you are supposed to let the ladybugs go as they will have nothing to eat. This is how they make money off of you as a refill of ladybug larvae is $15.99!	1
Our kit came with the ladybug larvae (as is in the description of this particular set), but not as many as they say they'll send.  I believe we got 7.  We received it within a couple days in good condition.  The larvae, which look nothing like ladybugs, were in a little tube with food and scraps of folded paper. We had no problems with keeping some water on the little sponge.  It took a little while longer than I expected, but eventually they attached themselves to various spots in the Ladybug Land.  I actually thought they all had died because I had never seen ladybugs in that stage.  Several days later, they all emerged as ladybugs!  They are initially a light orange color, but turn more red as time progresses.  We fed ours pieces of oranges and other fruit.  My kids enjoyed watching the ladybugs get bigger as larvae and eventually turn into the ladybugs we know and love.  Releasing them was a long process because the 'bugs come out on their own when they feel like it.  It was a fun experience and we will order more ladybugs in the future. :)	1
Lady bugs didn't survive through adult hood after following care instructions.	-1
No lady bugs lived, very disappointed, butterflies are much better!!	-1
Great experience for our preschoolers!	1
Got this for my niece...she sent away for the ladybug larvae with the voucher and was able to watch them grow in this. Very nice for teaching kids about ladybugs!	1
This was one of the most interest insect kits we've done!	1
Love it	1
So excited about these. My daughter has done the butterfly set, so she's pretty excited to be doing some ladybugs now. The larvae arrived in what seemed to be pretty healthy shape. This seems very simple and easy to maintain, can't wait to see some ladybugs.	1
Perfect, larvae - ladybugs.. just what I wanted.	1
I loved this and my students were in awe at the butterflies. I was able to release them this past Thursday and it was fabulous. I will order again when it gets closer to summer.	1
I bought this lady bug set for my children for easter. Let me just say they love it! We have had it up and going since Easter day.. we have about 6-7 lady bugs growing! I love the magnifying glass at the top, it gives my children a good look at what lady bug larva look like up close without actually going into the "home" They all crawl around pretty much all day, they don't just sit there. I have never had a problem putting water in on the sponge. I really appreciate this because it teaches my children, who are 4, that all things start out as babies and grow over time. It teaches them patience!	1
Like this little dog, but he could use a red collar or something. Being all black, sometimes it's hard to tell his face from his backside unless the light hits his eyes. He's very well made, and is soft and realistic.	1
My 4yo and I really enjoyed this. Especially him! However, these things started to stink so badly, that we could smell them even without opening the top for feedings. It came with lots of larvae, and my son looked forward to feeding them and watching them. However, because of smell, we ended up putting them in the garage and ignoring them after they moved from the larvae stage to pupae. I want to add that I also began to notice that these things not only pooped, but they also peed. That is where the smell was coming from, I believe. They are in a pretty tight space for 10 bugs, and that smell was unbearable after a while, even with the feeding hole closed. Even my 4yo son was so grossed out he told me to let them go. We live in Colorado, and it was winter, so I didn't let them go, I kept them in the garage, but we didn't mess with them. Much to my surprise, while washing the car about a week ago, I saw several lady bugs hanging out in our garage. We were thrilled! They flew away, and being spring in Colorado, we just got another blizzard today, so they probably all died, but if you can take the smell, this is a very cool way for kids to learn about the cycle of life. The bugs they sent us were obviously very sturdy. However, I would recommend ordering from the company directly via phone, not online, as the reps are very knowledgable, and gave me lots of good tips. I was not prepared for how gross lady bugs look and smell before they mature. Those things were looked like aliens.	1
So cuddly...I would buy again if and when I need another stuffed animal.	1
super soft and cuddly!	1
Lovely. My grandson really likes it. He takes care as if he were a real animal.	1
Adorably soft - I bought 5 of these Aurora flopsie plush dogs and they were all adored by the children who received them!	1
Bought it for my dog.  He loves it.  Likes to share it with me.	1
So I buy this product then have to pay $5 more to get the bugs! I don't like that.	-1
My kids have loved these over the years. The cap is easy to get off, so make sure to keep it clear of little ones. My little girl popped the cap and the bugs were climbing out.	1
We bought this house 2 years ago, for our then 2 year old.  We are still adding accessories, and now both our daughters (4 and 1) love this doll house.  We also have the Sweet Streets collection, but I like this one much more.  It holds most of the furniture inside the house which folds nicely for storage and takes up limited space if it is folded.  The accessories for this are almost endless.  The voices are very clear and help your child to imagine different pretend situations to act out.  We recently added the camping accessory which they loved.  We are buying a few more accessories this Christmas as well.	1
I have yet to give this to my two year old (we are saving it for Xmas) so I can't rate how much she likes it but I wanted to offer some tips. If you are getting this in advance for Xmas or a child's bday, I recommend opening the box before hand and applying all the stickers. (There really are a lot!) Also, ToysRUs just had a big buy one, get one free on all Fisher Price dollhouses and accesories (excluding Dora's dollhouse), so lots of people have put their[...] Hope that helps anyone looking for one to buy.	1
My daughter got this for Christmas last year when she was 2 1/2 and still plays with it almost every single day.  She liked the phrases it had at first, but rarely turns on the sound now.  I agree with other reviewers that the furniture is big for the space, but we just don't have it all, so there is room to play.  The durability of the house itself has been great.  Some of the furniture and accessories keep coming apart, but are easily fixed. I would like to see some new vehicles.  I don't see a car or mini van on amazon this year, and my daughters people are often in her slippers going here and there! I felt it was expensive when we bought it, but it has been a great buy.  Probably MY favortie toy that my daughter has.	1
Not "flopsie" at all....this is a fairly stiff stuffed animal...be forewarned! It's face was rather squished in and lopsided and odd looking as well. Sometimes ordering online backfires. This was one of those times. Really wanted a soft, cuddly, floppy black pup for my son to sleep with. This is more of a stand up and stare kind of pup.	-1
This was really fun. The kids loved it.	1
A little expensive for what it is. Very lightweight but cute.	1
Got this for my 5 year old grandson. We had a great time watching the ladies grow and then put them in our garden. Would recommend them to anyone who likes to watch nature happen	1
My 3 year old daughter received the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse for Christmas this year.  She loves it!  This dollhouse, in my opinion, is the best one out there!  I researched and carefully looked at each of the 3 Fisher Price Dollhouses, and the playmobile dollhouse, and like this one the best.  It's very durable, very roomy, and pretty.  Having three girls, we've had 3 different Fisher Price Dollhouses, and a Playmobile Victorian Dollhouse.  The Loving Family Fisher Price Classic Dollhouse is nice, but just doesn't have enough room to hold the furniture.  We tried this one first, and exchanged it for the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse.  I like the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse better than the bigger, more expensive one that has a fireplace that crackles and has sounds and lights, because the plastic is thicker and more durable, and prettier colors inside. I had a chance to play a little with this one as well, and found it tipped easily over and the plastic was not as thick and durable.  The playmobile Victorian Dollhouse is nice too, but my kids never played with it much.  The colors and style are more of an older styling, and my girls preferred the Fisher Price one's better.  My oldest daughter still has the original Fisher Price Dream Dollhouse, which is very simuliar to size as the new Sweet Sounds.  The Sweet Sounds comes with the most detailed and adorable furniture, a Dad, a Mom with combable hair, a big sister with combable hair, and a cute baby.  3 pieces of furniture are permantly attached (the rocking chair, little girl's room chair, & kitchen table chair)  to the flooring because these are the 3 pieces that make the 200 phases when the people are placed on them.  The moveable furniture included is an adorable cradle, highchair, & baby swing.  The stickers are very pretty , and there are tons that take sometime to apply but are worth it.  A sheet of additional optional stickers are included as well.  A nice touch.  You will have no trouble fitting in the extra furniture you will want to buy to furnish the house with, because there is a ton of room in this house.  The house closes easily and my 3 year old can close it herself.  It fold compact for storage and holds the furniture inside.  The 200 phases are very sweet.  My little girl likes the voices and it gives her ideas of different ways to play.  The sound can be turned on or off.  Some of the phrases are "how about a big Daddy hug?"  and "I like playing dollhouse with you".  All the phrases are very loving--like the perfect family! My 3 year old daughter has no trouble positioning the figures correctly to make them talk. Basically she just sits them in one of the 3 pieces of furniture that make them talk and they talk.  The 3 pieces that make the dolls talk are the rocking chair, kitchen chair, and the little girl's room chair.  Some of the additional furniture sets  have extra pieces that will talk, meow, or play music  in the dollhouse too. My 7 and 11 year old daughters think this dollhouse is fun too.  Take it from a Mom who has tried them all----this is the one to buy!	1
My puppy loved him they were best buddies until he ripped his face off.	1
My daughter loves these aurora flopsies... great quality stuffed animals!!	1
As expected	1
I got this as a gift for my daughter, we have a black lab she is head over heels in love with. And let me tell you this little guy is CUTE!!! I cant wait to give it to her on Christmas!! I've never been disappointed with Aurora plush!	1
Adorable	1
We ordered this for my daughter's birthday. The ladybugs were ordered online and they came promptly. Our entire family really enjoyed watching them grow from little ones to full fledge adult yellow ladybugs. We only had 6-7 make it to that stage. Some got squooshed inadvertently because we couldn't read and thought the magnifying glass top was not removable. We lifted the entire case and well, that led to the demise of a few poor babies.  I think because the lid didn't sit all the way flat on the bottom anymore (due to the poor carcasses), some of them escaped :p.  I was eating breakfast and 5 of them walked up to greet me :).  We had a lot of fun watching them and released the adults into our yard.	1
Wonderful purchase, so happy	1
I purchased this after my children and I had a delightful experience with the Insect Lore Butterfly Garden. I really wish that I had heeded the reviews on this product and saved myself some cash and my children disappointment. I ordered the ladybugs standard delivery and they all arrived alive and well. We put them in the habitat with their food and placed precisely the amount of water required on the sponge in the top of the habitat. Within 2 days, half had stopped moving--and they weren't pupating either. Within one day, a third more had met the same grisly fate. At present we have two ladybugs that appear to be trying to pupate, but we aren't holding our breath that this experiment is going to pan out. The habitat is poorly and cheaply designed. The plastic top doesn't sit all the way down on the base, and the ladybugs get trapped under the rim of the lid. The sponge for their water dries out way too fast. You are only supposed to add water every day and a half, but that wasn't enough for my bugs. In 24 hours, the sponge was completely dry. The food included wasn't enough to get them to pupate. They ate it all up, and the instruction manual said you could give them raisins after they emerged as ladybugs, but there wasn't enough nourishment to get them to that state. It was like a poorly done terrarium, the Shady Pines of the bug world-- the final home for little critters who won't get proper care.	-1
Insect Lore makes great stuff and this is no exception. My kids loved watching the lady bugs hatch and then we released them in the garden. Totally cool!!!	1
very cute, very soft, very snuggly.  my son is thrilled!	1
Our daughter loves her "Dah" (dog).  It's soft, doesn't shed and has stayed in pretty good shape through lots of baby hugs, and come baby chewing.	1
Looking forward to having ladybugs!	1
Lady bugs were delivered dead. Twice.	-1
Mine was damaged when I received it. I tried to fix it with tape but then the larva got caught in the tape. The sponge at the top got moldy after a week. And the larva come in a tube with paper scraps and these are hard to remove without letting the bugs get out. Not very practical. It's a great idea though, just wish it was higher quality.	-1
I bought this for my nephew and he loved it. You do have to spend 5 extra dollars to get your larvae shipped to you. It seems like that cost should be baked in to the product cost and a code provided versus having to buy them after. I say this only because if you give it as a gift you will need to plan ahead if you want the larvae to arrive close to when the gift is being given.	1
adorable!! got this to donate to toys for tots over the holidays and had a moment when I didn't want to give it away! hope he found a good home!	1
It's a plush dog. What else is there to say? Buy it.	1
A little smaller than I pictured, but very cute!	1
This is the best plush animal I bought on Amazon it is so cute	1
Great plush puppy. Perfect for the kid who wants a black lab without the responsibilities of feeding, cleaning, etc.! This dog has been through a lot with us and has held up great so far.	1
Got this for my niece. Really cute, and a perfect substitute for the two girls till they get older and maybe have a real dog. Seems very well constructed, and should hold together well. Cole the puppy is a great stuffed toy for a 5 and 7 year old.	1
adorable	1
Usually, I think of buying stuffed animals for children, but I purchased this little Black Lab for a friend who lives in a nursing home. She really misses the dog she used to own before her confinement.  She loves this little dog SO much!!  Each time I visit her, she is cradling the puppy in her arms, stroking the soft fur.  She sleeps with the dog, and finds great comfort from holding this very soft and loveable dog.  She was so happy when I gave it to her, and it makes me feel wonderful when I see how much joy this little stuffed animal has brought to someone.  The dog is adorable, and I would recommend it to anyone of any age who loves dogs.	1
Very cute,	1
The boy that I purchased this little dog for thoroughly enjoys it, sleeps with it, and has asked for more "puppies".	1
For the price paid the item is good quality. Beats buying a far more expensive stuffed animal from the store.	1
My kids love doing this every year.  Caterpillars came very quickly and all hatched!	1
My daughter is obsessed with ladybugs so I got this for her fifth birthday. We got the larva in the mail and put them in the thing. They didn't come as eggs. Anyway, some did fall down in the crack where the lid meets the bottom but they were fine there. They just crawled out of they wanted. I think we got 10-12 and they all lived through the whole thing. They attached to the sides and then the pupae hatched and viola, pretty red ladybugs. We fed them raisins and watered them but I just hate the thought of caged animals or bugs so we let them go maybe a week after they hatched. Had bugs in items than a month but it was still cool. I know I've seen a few around the yard still.	1
My daughter ordered this for her father as a Christmas present. She loved it, he loved it. Took it to work and put it on his desk. Very cute puppy	1
I purchased this stuffed puppy for my 4 year old to be his "puppy" when my 13 year old got a real puppy for christmas. It was the perfect size for him and he loves it. It is made from a quality fur. It is so soft and very sturdy!	1
Bought this for my 3 year old. He loves it. It is very soft and cute. I would recommend this stuffed animal for all ages.	1
I bought this for one of my granddaughters and it's OK, but she didn't particularly like it.  I think it's better to buy these plush animals in person, so we can see their expressions before purchasing.	1
The kiddos love this.	1
The actual dome and accessories are great - love the idea.  However, I paid the extra money for second day shipping to ensure that the bugs arrived alive for my child's birthday.  (The Insect Lore website recommends second day to improve the chances of survival).  The shipping tube was emptied into the dome immediately upon arrival and only 1 larva was alive.  So, we are watching our lonely bug do its thing around the dome.  Very disappointed.  Update:  The Insect Lore customer service is appalling.  I went to the website to ask for another tube of ladybugs since they guarantee that five will make it to adulthood.  There is neither a phone number nor e-mail address list listed for customer service on the website - there is only a live chat.  I explained my situation to the person on the chat.  She provided an e-mail address to which I was to e-mail photos of my ladybug land and an explanation of the problem so that she could work with a manager to help me.  I immediately complied and sent the information as requested.  That was eight days ago, and I have not received so much as an automated "We're working on it."  I'm not amused.	-1
SO fun! Kids loved it and they were very successful. Directions are perfect if you follow them. Order the larvae online and they'll come quickly.	1
FUN...never ordered the babes just captured and released big ones.	1
Pros: 1) Watching the life cycle of ladybugs  Cons: 1) Having to order the ladybugs separately, I get it, but the ordering process was a pain in the ass.  Took me two days and 3 complaints for anyone in customer service to actually do something about getting the order put through. 2) Once ladybugs arrived (within 5 days of ordering) I counted 12 pupae. 3) Poured the pupae and their food into the dome as instructed and most of the food went straight onto the water pad.  I pushed a bunch off with my finger to distribute it. 4) Did not know ladybug pupa were cannibals.  The next morning (loaded pupa in the night before) I only counted 2.  I kept asking my 5 yr old if she opened the top, and she maintained she hadn't.  Then I saw what appeared to be bits of pupa.  Yup, when hungry they will turn on each other. 3)Dome is poorly designed.  As other reviewers have mentioned the larvae went straight to the bottom in the small crevice.  One has escaped the crevice, the other is still down there two days later.  Too afraid to lift cover off because I will probably squish it.  Overall, it's a cute dome, and it's cool to see ladybugs grow, but I would save my money on buy this cheap piece of plastic and make your own home for them.  Customer service does say they will replace the ladybugs if you don't have enough that mature.  I will be taking them up on the offer.

A ladybug death trap!  All our larvae hung out in the crevices at the bottom of the dome, so really hard to see and find them.  We never opened it and a couple escaped - mind you the kids (against my say so) picked it up several times to look at it.  Luckily we found them!  Also when you poor the food in - it falls right on the water sponge...?  Not sure how much food they got out of the gupy mess.  The pupa stage was better as they came to the top and a couple of them attached to the dome so you could see the changes from the underside too.  But a couple adults got caught again in the crevices at the bottom and could not move.  In my attempts to help them I squished one and a pupa in the process.  I think a large glass container with a bit of sponge for water would be better - no crevices, easier to see and you can direct the food better. Then too you can prepare them for the outside world with vegetation from your garden etc.  Secondarily, the poo also stinks in there.  Another reason to use a glass jar and recycle later.  Loved the process - hated the dome! See pics of crevices and squished ladybug =(	-1
We started with 11 ladybugs and are now down to 3. We have lost some because of poor dome design and others due to cannibalism. I didn't know ladybugs will eat each other. Luckily my daughter just thinks they are playing. There is a space where the dome and the base snap together and that is how they escape. Hopefully we will have one at the end.	-1
I love the idea but the way the lid is made, it's easy to accidentally squish ladybugs while closing it.	-1
I have not used my lady bug farms yet, but I have high hopes that it is going to be amazing.  The negative review is because you have to redeem your insect larvae certificate at Insect Lore dot com.  I ordered 3 of these and 3 of the butterfly gardens and my certificates did not work because you are not allowed to bundle them with any other products.  Ie - Maybe the certificates work if you redeem them INDIVIDUALLY with no other products, but otherwise no go.  This is a problem if you are buying more than one because you need to have them shipped 2nd day air.  Obviously, if you don't bundle the order, you'll spend more than the certificates are worth in shipping.  If you do standard lead-time, from the time you order until the time you have a hatched butterfly is about 5 to 8 weeks.  I wish I had known what a total cluster this was going to be when I ordered.	-1
bought it for my grandaughter. she loved it. :)	1
The habitat itself is great. The required process of ordering the ladybug larva that go in it is a ripoff. The larva are free with purchase of this habitat, but the overnight shipping ($31) is recommended. Although I had ours shipped as recommended, we received only two live larvae...the rest were dead. So, we raised two amazingly perfect ladybugs that cost us $15 each. Ha. With that said, it was still worth it. My kids and I loved watching them change as we learned about metamorphosis. Worth every penny. I'd do it all over again. It was super cool.	1
Fun, educational item for kids at a great price.	1
My 5 year old had a lot of fun hatching her very own pink ladybugs and caring for them.	1
My daughter loves ladybugs and this is a fun way to watch them for a while. We keep buying them at the store because she likes to let them go	1
This was a gift. I haven't heard any negative comments about it so I assume it was satisfactory in every way.	1
My niece and nephew love raising Lady Bugs.	1
Worked great	1
Educational. Fun for kids and adults. Got this as a present for the school at my 4 year-old's b-day party. I've had 2 sets before and kids love to watch the ladybugs go through their stages. I like the new design better - it has bigger viewing area. I was told by my kids that I need to buy one for home as well, even though I have the old model still.	1
Cute Habitat	1
It worked very well and my grandchildren really enjoyed watching the ladybugs. I thought it could have been a little cheaper.	1
Awesome activity! Daughter loves it! It is also reusable. You only need to order more larvae each year!	1
We ordered Ladybug Land in June.  We received the order with 3 live bugs, none of which made it to ladybug-hood.  Explaining THAT to a 4 year old is not fun.  I noticed on the company website in late July that they have suspended shipments due to hot temperatures and will start again when it cools off.  This has gotten me thinking that if you live in a hot climate (as I do), it is probably not best to order these in the summer.  The packaged showed up in a regular UPS box and was sitting on my doorstep when I got home.  What the company ought to do is provide recommended shipping temperature ranges so that people know when to order or not order.  I'm not sure if that is what killed all my bugs, but it was probably around 90 degrees when they arrived (although my doorstep would have been in the shade).  I am contacting the company with the hope that they will be able to provide more bugs, although temperatures will be even hotter the next couple of months so we will see if that helps or not.	-1
This is the second time we've purchased ladybug larvae for our Ladybug Land.  We were going to order it directly from Insect Lore but Amazon was slightly less expensive, so we went that route.  The larvae were healthy and we ended up with about 8-10 lady bugs that we released the other day.  It's a great learning to for children; my kids love watching the progression each day...	1
Got this for my 6 year old for graduating kindergarten and she loves it.  Great to watch and it teaches her responsibility with something she loves.  She loves lady bugs so this was  no brainier.  Was a lot better quality then i expected and the lady bugs got here in a timely manner.	1
We study ladybugs in our classroom.  Our PTO purchased Ladybug Land for us, and my students LOVED it!  The online ordering was extremely easy (there is an additional shipping charge), and my ladybugs came in a timely manner.  The ladybugs were alive, and the directions were very clear.  We watched them go through the stages of the ladybug life cycle, and I let them go on the playground one day after school.  My students came in from recess the next day and said, "We found ladybugs that looked just like the kind we had."  I love my kindergartners!	1
So much fun!!! The lady bugs came in the mail within a few days!! They are very hardy and we haven't lost one yet!! It is so fun to watch the little world going on inside!! My kids love them!! I docked one star because you do have to pay $5 shipping for the ladybugs so add $5 to whatever price amazon is asking. Totally worth it though!!	1
Good place to grow ladybugs. Can see them well. Observe growth great for teaching kids and grown ups .Learn about insects while seeing them grow. Thanks Sandra	1
We love this item! I think I loved it as much as my son did (he's 2.5 years old). Every day my son wanted to see "how these guys are doing." All of our larvae developed and were successfully freed in the back yard. We want to get the preying mantis set next! Or, at least, MOM does. :) Edit: We live near San Diego, CA and raised our ladybugs in March/April; the weather was not an issue for us (not to gloat!)	1
I had no issues with this product or in reference to receiving the ladybug larvae.  Once we got them, we followed the directions exactly and everything worked out just fine.  I don't think we lost any of the larvae throughout the process.  All of them beefed up on the food provided, then wrapped themselves into a cocoon before finalizing the transformation into a ladybug.  It was a great educational experience for my kids.  They were just memorized by watching the entire process.  We enjoyed it so much we ended up ordering more ladybugs.  No negative experiences for us in reference to this educational product.  T.S.

I purchased 9 kits for Girl Scouts and TRIED to contact the firm to discuss the ridiculous $5 fee per kit ($45 for our troop) for a "tube" of larva! It is a total rip off. But there is no way to actually speak to anyone at the company so I resorted to email. I was told a manager would get back to me by the end of the day, but that didn't happen and when I sent a SECOND email, this time the response was "no manager is available." In other words, WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU! I wanted to not only "discuss" the $45 fee but also needed to better understand the delivery/shipment time to time this properly with our next Girl Scout meeting. But, since no one cared to call me or answer my question via email, I am left to hope for the best. I suspect we've just paid $45 for a bunch of dead larva. RIP OFF!!	-1
I bought the ladybug larvae for a science class at school. I have always had ant, worms, and tadpoles in my classroom but this is the first year with the ladybugs.  I was very impressed with how easy they were to start. I had purchased the ladybug land previously which made starting them even easier. All I had to do was add a couple of drops of water to the cotton in the land and then add the larvae. They all seemed very healthy and strong. Students are fascinated with them. It is a great hands-on learning experience for them.  I would highly recommend ordering ladybug larvae from this vendor.	1
Students love all of the new things we implement in the classroom setting.  We love watching the students reactions as they discover new items throughout the classroom	1
As promised by the company, I received a tube of approx 11 super small ladybug larvae with brown-colored powdery food.  Let it be known that the commercial posted here on Amazon is inaccurate/ not recently updated.  It is beginning of March in Northern California (temp = 55-70 degrees) and all the ladybugs arrived in the tube ALIVE! Hooray! I'm already luckier than several other Ladybug land customers. haha. Its been almost 2 days and they've grown so much.  I followed the instructions except for one step so far... The instructions and the Amazon video indicate to dump the tube's contents through the habitat's small hole at the top. After reading other negative reviews regarding moldy ladybug food beforehand, I decided that this action would actually cause the ladybug food to spoil, probably causing a toxic environment for the ladybugs. So, I actually took off the clear cover of the habitat first. Then, I dumped nearly powdery food onto the habitat's dry flattened area on the side of the hill. Still having the tube's open end on the flat area, I guided the clear cover's small open top over the tube's closed end. Be quick though, because you don't want to lose a ladybug! Once the clear cover snapped into place, then I emptied the paper strip and ladybugs into the container. This allowed the food to stay on the side of the hill. Finally, I used the enclosed dropper to place bottled water droplets into the gray fuzz in the water reservoir. Another option is to empty the clear cover upside down and then snap the bottom habitat into the cover while everything upside down.  My 2.5 yr old daughter is really enjoying the ladybug larvae right now.  3/16/2014 update: The larvae have now molted into adorable little ladybugs! Super easy maintenance of just adding some drops of water into the fuzzy ball reservoir. Nothing else needed to be done. Being a science nerd, I'm having more fun than my daughter, but whatever! Its fun. Its cheap. Its easy maintenance. Its been 2 weeks and they appear to be alive. So far, 11 ladybugs total. I'm happy with my experience. Company delivered ladybugs as promised. Ladybugs healthy and fun to watch. No problems at all.  3/21/2014 update: The larvae turned into adult ladybugs after 3 weeks of having them. Everything went an planned, according to the instructions. I am very pleased with product and my daughter enjoyed it so much! Due to the instructions indicating the ladybug life would be approx 3 weeks in habitat, I decided to let them free now. Too bad.... lots of fun! Looks like we'll need to order more soon!	1
We'd done the butterfly kits for a couple of years and wanted to do something different. I had no idea where lady bugs came from now we know. We had no problem with the larve. They went through all the stages the instructions said and came out or hatched as expected. They are so little you have to be careful when you put them into the kit because they can spill easily. I was chasing little things all around my carpet. Probably won't do it again because once was enough but would recommend.	1
It's a small jar and once the lady bugs FINALLY arrived, they never ended up hatching.  Big waste of money.	-1
Product arrived on time and was as described	1
I could never get ours open so we were never able to use it. The butterfly garden was much better	-1
We attempted to get the Ladybug Land for our bug loving child. The item we received was very different than the item pictured on Amazon. The one pictured shows the different levels almost up to the top of the dome for the bugs to hang out and walk around. The one we received has just one level of path to walk on, and the rest is just wasted space filled with air. Not fun at all. We exchanged it, Amazon sent us a new one, and it was the same thing. Thinking the older model had the extra climbing and walking paths, the newer version is junk. Don't waste your money.	-1
My daughter has played with this stroller for over a year now, and it's still holding up.  Occasionally the bar at the bottom of the backside will unsnap or the wheels will pop off, but it's not a huge deal as they pop right back in.  All in all, it has been a good toy....	1
I purchased this stroller for my daughter, who is a tiny 17 month old, because I thought she would like it. She does. She hasn't stopped using it, and although I thought it wasn't too well made, it works just fine in the house. It is perfect for her size, which is small, where the other strollers were too big for her. If your child is average or above average size, this stroller probably won't last long. My little one can't work the velcro strap too well yet, but we haven't had any problems with anyting falling off, and she isn't easy on her toys. We do recommend it, but agree with some of the other reviewers about how it is made and the small size.	1
I bought this stroller for my daughter when she was 4.  I was pretty disappointed in how cheaply it was made and how small it was.  I haven't had problems with the wheels or the seatbelt like others have but have had the white cross bar fall off repeatedly so I just took it off.  My daughter had no problem strapping her dolls or stuffed animals in (as long as they were small, it won't fit average sized dolls) but the stroller is so small that my daughter has to crouch over to push it.  It is so frustrating for her that I took it away and bought her one of those umbrella strollers.  This would be a good first stroller for a 1 or 2 year old, or a very small 3 year old but any child older or bigger would be disappointed.	1
UPDATE - We have purchased the lady bugs and are really enjoying them! I couldn't wait until the spring. This has been a GREAT learning experience for my daughter and my husband and I are enjoying it to. We haven't had any issues with dead lady bugs and they all seem to be growing strong and healthy. I was worried since the habitat is plastic there would be a gripping issue (thinking the lady bugs would slip alot) but there have been no issues. This is great! I love that we can continue to use this too and we can order more lady bugs every few months. GREAT product!  My daughter is obsessed with bugs, I bought this and the butterfly kit (which I won't pull out until spring) and she is enjoying this immensely. Every day we have check on the lady bugs, she loves to name them and draw pictures! Great learning experience for your little ones!	1
It is cheaper to buy a whole new Ladybug land than to order the ladybugs independently. My son enjoyed seeing them be released.	1
Gave this as a gift to my grandson.  So cute.  He loves bugs and watching how they live and act.	1
We loved watching the lady bug larvae , and then seeing lady bugs emerge! Was a favorite of the bugs this year.	1
It seemed like a good stroller in the store, we have had a few cheap fabric umbrella doll strollers that ripped (my kids' are hard on stuff!!) so I figured with an all plastic seat we would be good here. Not so, the wheels constantly fall off, we have lost one of them so now the stroller is no good. The seat belt comes out and is a frustration to me to keep putting it back in.  And it doesn't fit any other dolls well, if you have a lot of small dolls it's ok but only one of my daughter's dolls fits in here. It's fine for a short child as a first stroller, maybe in the 1-2 year old range as long as they have help putting the doll in it. Otherwise save a few bucks and just get one of those $7.99 umbrella strollers Toys R us sells!	-1
dd received this as a gift at around 1 yr of age.  She was just learning to walk at the time and we found that the stroller was very light and not sturdy enough for her to assist in her new walking ventures.  We put away and pulled out a couple of months later when she started having an interest in her stuffed animals and now loves running around with it.  PROS:  - Very light weight  - Great height for young kids  - Easy to use Canopy  - Fairly easy to assemble  - Once strapped in, holds dolls in securly  - We didn't have the same "wheel" problem that others did, however dd is pretty gentle with her toys  - Holds many sizes of dolls, stuffed animals, etc  CONS:  - Very "girly"  - Only fits smaller dolls because the straps are too short to fit around larger dolls (even the the seat is wide enough and tall enough to hold up to an 18' doll)  - Velcro is hard for little hands to secure because straps are shorter  - Doesn't "fold-up" making it difficult to take on trips to grandma & grandpas house  THERE ARE BETTER ONES OUT THERE FOR THE PRICE (GRACO UMBRELLA DOLL STROLLER $9.99)- ALTHOUGH MAKES A GREAT "FIRST STROLLER"	-1
The LadyBug Land arrived in perfect condition, no problems with that item itself.  But, then we ordered the larvae from Insect Lore (with the coupon code included in this item).  The package arrived earlier than tracking information indicated and was placed in my mailbox where it sat in the August heat in St. Louis for several hours since I wasn't expecting it til the next day.  I was surprised they were shipping it in such hot weather to begin with (temps were 90's-100) so I was very worried and keeping track of where it was so I could make sure I'd get to them quickly.  They were in a white, unmarked bubble mailer - no indication of anything living inside of it.  When I opened it, it was obvious they were ALL dead.  There were about 20 larvae in there.  I had hoped maybe once I got them into their LadyBug Land and put a couple drops of water on the sponge that they would perk up or something, but they didn't.  All obviously dead.  I sent Insect Lore emails and pictures of the dead larvae - no response.  It's been 2 weeks and I don't expect to hear back from them...  I'm planning on filing a complaint with amazon and seeing if they'll have better luck getting in touch with Insect Lore than I have.  We ordered butterfly larvae from Insect Lore last year and had a great experience!  We expected it to be the same with the ladybugs, but we are VERY disappointed.  My 5yr old daughter is so very disappointed, as am I.  She cried because they were all dead and she didn't even get a chance to see them do anything.  I would NOT recommend this product.  *** UPDATE ***  I still have had no response from Insect Lore as of 03/11/14...	-1
Even adults had fun with this.  Given by me to my child for birthday and I Pre ordered the bugs so they arrived just a day after she opened this.  We had a great live bug success rate with only a few losses.  Will buy again for gifts!	1
We followed the directions exactly but the ladybugs never grew. They remained a tiny black dot. They must have come dead.	-1
My grandkids loved this - their mom, not so much - but lots of hatched ladybugs released into their veggie garden!	1
I was excited to purchase this for my kids to witness the life cycle of lady bugs. I also have an organic vegetable garden and was equally excited to release the adult lady bugs into it when they were adults. I never got to fully do either.....  I found this kit when I was searching for "live lady bugs" to order as beneficial insects for my garden. I though this would be great. Based on the first two 5 star reviews from 2004 on this product I went ahead and ordered.  - You have to pay $5 more to have the lady bug larvae shipped to you.... ( I wish this was in larger print on the product description page, not a big deal as I understand shipping live insects does cost money, just wish I had seen it before ordering) - Our first batch of larvae all arrived DOA. I emailed customer service and they told me to wait a week to make sure before contacting them back. They said sometimes the larvae do not move much and need time to acclimate. I wrote them back after a week as everything still was DOA. - The second batch arrived a few days later. The company does ship well and provided tracking and email confirmations which was nice. This time only half the contents of the shipping vial were DOA. You can clearly see the live ones moving around. I think the week wait was a little much. You should be able to discern viability in just 24-36 hrs. However, they do make you wait the required number of days. - We filled the dome food tray with the wet sponge and placed the larvae inside. Soon mold began to grow on the food sponge and larvae started dying. Within one week all the larvae were dead despite us cleaning out the mold and following the instructions to the letter! - It is a real heart breaking experience for the kids to watch the larvae not make it. We also don't like seeing that as well. I believe the habitat's design could be better improved upon. The larvae food, feeding, water sponge and air circulation seem to be the main factors that affected us.  - I can only conclude that I would have been way better off just ordering larvae and putting them directly out in my garden. The kids could have visited the garden and we could have tried seeing them there. After spending $20 to end up with a cheap plastic habitat that will end up in the garbage and to watch 2 sets of lady bug larvae die, it was definitely not worth it!  I think there are some major issues here..... I wish I could return this but by the time all of this has occurred it is now past the 30 return window.  I hope this review helps and perhaps has saved some lady bug larvae lives.....  Anything that involves live creatures should absolutely be well tested and continually monitored and updated as needed to ensure the best for the creatures and people involved. This is just not acceptable.	-1
Insect Lore Ladybug Land. It is easy to set up and to place your order for the ladybugs. Really simple to put the bugs into the container. The kids and the grandparents too, are learning a lot about the beginning of a larvae to ladybug. It is very interesting to watch them grow and change, and how to take care of them We can't wait to see them change too. Great experience.	1
This is a great on-going project for your youngin', especially during the loooong summer months. The actual ladybug eggs/pupae ship separately from a different company (you send in an included certificate to get them). We ordered this with the "Insect Lore Ladybug Life Cycle Stages" toys -- high quality, large representations of your ladybugs in each of their stages. The "Ladybug Land" is washable and reusable -- just order more eggs.  You can always donate this to your local primary teacher to use!  I highly recommend Insect Lore's butterfly "kits" as well.	1
The habitat is sturdy and easily reusable. The container of larvae had 7 crawling around and a couple of eggs that hatched a few days later. This gave us a chance to watch them go into the pupal stage over a few day span. This was a wonderful way to finish up a science chapter on beetles!	1
I ordered this kit for my 6 and 3 year old children. It came with a certificate to order lady bugs from insectlore.com for just the shipping and handling ($5). We ordered them in April so they came very quickly, they were here the next week! Every one of them has survived to become adult lady bugs and my kids have thoroughly enjoyed watching them eat, drink, and transform! They are very easy to take care of and will be great organic pest control in my garden when we let them go.  The dome is reusable so you can order more larvae (for full price). We will definitely be doing this again next spring along with our other bug habitats!	1
I Have used lady bugs for 14 years with my students and family.  Never ceases to amaze.  A real keeper.	1
Bought this in conjunction with the butterfly garden.  the children loved watching the little ladybugs hatch and grow.  Good learning tool, especially for those of us who home school our children.	1
We got one of these as a gift, and it was a total failure.  The "Vehicle Sound Block" toy is supposed to make the sounds of the vehicles when the blocks are lined up correctly.  We got the batteries in, but the toy simply didn't work.  No sound, no nothin.'  We also were given one of their farm sound puzzle toys and couldn't get the back panel for the batteries to open.  Tried using a small philips screwdriver, a safety pin, etc., and it simply would not open.  The lack of sound was disappointing, though our child still liked the pretty puzzle.  This company seems to do well with plain wood toys, but when they branch out into electronics, the products are fairly shoddy.  I plan to avoid their products in the future.	-1
We bought this for DD. We have also bought her the ant hill and butterfly habitat. I always love getting these. They are just as exciting to us as they are for her. A great thing to do together as a family.	1
We have used Ladybug Land with two batches of larvae and both have worked perfectly in terms of development into maturity. We did have to wait to order them the first time due to heat but not for very long. We found it worked well both times and my child enjoyed it immensely. They are easy to care for and very pretty. We released them in garden and found the container easier to clean than I had expected. I would recommend for a gift for nature loving kids, just be mindful of the temperature in your area at the time of year when you'd like to give the gift.	1
I bought this as a gift for my nature loving 3yo niece.  Her mom ordered the larva and within 3 days they had been delivered.  Set up was easy enough for my niece to do it herself. It took about 9 days for the ladybugs to pupate and hatch, which my sister and niece released into their garden.  There's also a website that gives other ideas for Ladybug Land and you can re-order more ladybugs from the site as well.  They really enjoyed watching the metamorphasis and this was a great Christmas gift for a kid that's really into all things animal.	1
We were doing a unit study on ladybugs and used Ladybug land to teach about the different stages of the ladybug. The kids got to watch the ladybugs go from larval stage to pupal, then to the adult stage. Our ladybug adults were pink which just tickled the kids. So nice to see different types of ladybugs as we learned there were many many types. We even go to feed our ladybugs the aphids from our backyards. Just a great product to teach kids all about these wonderful bugs!	1
I bought this for my soon to be 6 year old sister.  I know that she enjoys nature so I thought this would be perfect.  It does come with a free coupon to send away for ladybug larvae and food.  That would be exciting for a kid to wait for the mail (since mail has become obselete anymore!)  I bought this with the lifecycles of the lady bug children's book for her to learn and enjoy while she waits for her bugs to arrive.  I think it's a fun gift for children ages Pre-K through 2nd.	1
These started peeling right after opening! My son was more impressed with other Christmas toys and didn't play with them really at all. They sat on the shelf and when I pulled them down today the stickers were coming off!	-1
We are quite disappointed in this product. I followed the directions and mold started growing in the habitat while the ladybugs were in their pupa stage. It was so gross that I ended up putting it outside with the lid off. Then the ants discovered it and we never got to the adult stage. Even before the mold developed it just wasn't as interesting as the butterfly kit.	-1
We ordered the Lady Bug Land for our daughter for Easter.  There were no lady bugs included!  NO WHERE on the order form in their catalogue or on their website does it say anything about the lady bugs NOT being included.  So they give you a coupon and an order form that says you have to include FIVE DOLLARS for shipping and handling of the lady bugs, after we already paid $19.99.  TOTAL RIP OFF.  Do not order this product.  If you want your child to learn about lady bugs, you're better off just walking out to your back yard in the spring and get your own lady bugs!!!	-1
I feel like the quality of Melissa and Doug has dropped over the last six or seven years. This used to be a favorite brand in our family but sadly the quality has become poor. This is th 3third item we purchased this season that disappointed us.  Cheap partial/paper board instead of wood and careless sticker placement. Since when did they stop putting in batteries?	-1
I already had this set of blocks and enjoyed several years of entertainment with my one and only grandchild. Years later his little brother began picking at the pictures on this set of blocks as he did with labels on jars and even a little tear on my coffee table. That's not the fault of the manufacturer, that's this one grandsons little quirk, which he has outgrown. I ordered another set of blocks because it is educational and fun. Three grandchildren have enjoyed my original set of blocks. Now I have two sets of blocks to be enjoyed by all eleven grandchildren. The pictures on the original set are a bit chipped but it still works perfectly and I'll always recall my little Braxton's hands working away.	1
My two year old son fell in love with these at daycare. Everyday when I would pick him up he couldn't wait to show me this puzzle. I love that it's the introduction to puzzles but only three pieces. He still learns about matching edges/colors/pictures but this isn't nearly as complicated or messy as some regular puzzles. There is a reward for getting the pieces right. He loves to create the various noises, which inspires him to keep trying. In addition, it teaches him something about what the different pictures sound like and apply it to the sounds he hears outside.  This particular toy has occupied him for twenty glorious minutes at a time. Definitely money well spent.	1
I didn't realize that the pictures on the puzzle were literally just stickers. I bought this puzzle a bit prematurely for my one year old so he's played with it once, and the stickers are already peeling off.	-1
I bought this as a shared gift for my two girls who are 2 and 8 for Christmas.  After the initial disappointment that there were no actual ladybugs included in the set, their interest was renewed when the larvae came in the mail a week & additional $5 later.  Even though we have a book about ladybugs, we didn't know how they actually change. Currently they are all balled up and stuck to the walls in our "Land" slowly morphing into flying spotted insects right before our very eyes!  Every day they change a little bit and they aren't in a cocoon, so you can actually see it.  I'm just dreading coaxing them out of the tiny little hole in the top once they have grown.  I guess it's a good thing little fingers can't access their home, but it sure would be nice to pop the top off to clean the home for the next batch. Next, hissing cockroach land? ... nah.	1
I bought Ladybug Land for my son's sixth birthday.  We've already raised sea monkeys, butterflies, and had an ant farm.  This was so fascinating to watch, even for the adults.  The life cycle is quick, and the kids don't lose interest.	1
My kids love this! It only took less than a week after ordering our ladybugs for them to arrive! The microscope on the top is not that great, actually its not great at all. We have had this for a few weeks now and the ladybugs are now in the pupa stage. It has kept their excitement and interest. They check on them everyday and are excited to see the ladybugs emerge! We have been doing lots of research on the different stages. the only problem we had was that the top is not very secure to the bottom and I ended up taping it on. Some of the food escaped from the bottom and is now stuck on the tape on the outside..but there was plenty in there to last them.	1
My 3yr old daughter loved raising and letting go of her ladybugs! She is so into nature and the outdoor's and this was a perfectly fun learning experience for her!! Looking forward to raising and letting go of our butterflies :)	1
Fun for the kids	1
This was my first Melissa & Doug purchase and I was very disappointed.  While the concept is great, the quality is very poor.  The vehicle images are just stickers adhered to the blocks, and they were done so poorly with waves and bubbles in them.  The actual "wood" is very light weight and perhaps more a cheap particle board. (?) I often by my wooden toys from HABA and based on reviews thought I would give the M & D a try.  They are no where near the quality of HABA.  Very cheap	-1
To start my review, I would like to mention that I bought these from Amazon, and paid less than if you were to buy the from Insect Lore direct.  I am not sure I would pay that high of an amount for this product.  However, with the price on Amazon, we were thrilled with this product.  We purchased this in December for Christmas, but waited until the end of May when it was warm, but still cool, to get the ladybugs.  They are shipped via USPS.  I ordered them on Wednesday, but the company waited until Monday to ship them to make sure that they didn't spend a weekend in the post office.  When they arrived, we had 15 live larvae.  They grew and produced into lady bugs.  We ended up with 8 lady bugs.  They were very active and fun to watch.  We also purchased the butterfly, and although I would recommend that one as well, this one was more fun to watch.  A lot was going on, and my kids really liked how tiny they were.  They would pull out their magnifying glasses and look at them all the time.  I am thoroughly pleased with this purchase, but just like any and all products, make sure it is the appropriate price for the purchase.	1
Purchased this for our 4-year old son who loves insects of all kinds, especially ladybugs.  The Ladybug Land dome is a larger than I expected (love that!) and it is colorful and cheerful to look at.  We redeemed our Ladybug Larvae Certificate online and received the larva in the mail in exactly 3 weeks (got antsy on week 2 and reached out to Ladybug Land Customer Service - they were very prompt and helpful).  After watching our 10 ladybug larva crawl around in the dome for a couple of weeks, we are now watching them change into pupa!  Completely facinating!  In a couple of days, we'll be looking at ladybugs.  I expect we will reuse the Ladybug Land habitat year after year (you can order more larva); it would also be a great item to donate/pass along to a school.	1
My 3 year old loves this and her butterfly garden. Shes a little more advanced then most 3 year old so i reccomend that you keep a close eye on your child if they are young. She has learned so much she tells everyone that she has a butterfly garden that is in the chrysalide stage and it's amazing. The seller was great perfect condition shipped super fast, I had it within 4 days of ordering. Thanks	1
I bought 2 of these, one for each of my grandsons and they loved it.  One 4, the other 2 and enjoy the sounds when they get the puzzle correct.  Great learning toy with clear sounds. I am very pleased.	1
My son started playing with these around the time he turned 2. Being that he loves all types of transportation he loved them! He quickly learned how to twist his wrist around while holding it to look at various sides to find the side he needed. Then he learned how to use both hands to turn it from side to side until he got the side he needed to face up. Lastly, he learned order, how to put the front side down first and the backside down second. He mastered all of this in a matter of days and it was all due to motivation of hearing the vehicle's noise. Great toy - definitely helps with the aforementioned skill sets and kept his attention long after his initial successes. We bought the animal sound blocks too and he liked them also but his love for vehicles made these his favorite.	1
I have bought other sets from Insect Lore, though not this one.  BE AWARE THAT THE GIFT IS NOT IMMEDIATELY USEFUL!!!  You must send off for the larvae, either by mail or online, pay a shipping charge (usually $5), and wait two weeks or so for mail delivery.  It is best to order the critters in spring or summer.  The Ladybug Larvae are guaranteed to arrive live.  There should be ten to fifteen larvae, and they guarantee that five of them will become ladybugs.  Of course, the process does not always go as planned.  If it does, it can be fun -- but it helps if your kids are the patient type who are interested to watch the larvae or ladybugs even when they aren't "doing" anything much.  Nature is not as dramatic from moment to moment as it appears on TV!  If you do not have good results (and you still have your certificate when you discover that), you can contact Insect Lore to request replacement.  If the certificate is missing, search "Insect Lore" online to find their website and contact them to see if they will honor the guarantee without the certificate.  You can also purchase more larvae at the website, so even if your ladybugs are alive, you have the option of purchasing more critters.  The item you want is called "Certificate For Ladybug Land Larvae Refill" and costs $15 at the moment. (Be sure to check whether your order will be shipped out then, or if you need to get them later.)  I was able to buy the full Ladybug Land set for less than that price, so the refills are no bargain.  But it can be a way to make the gift re-useable.  When it works, this gift is a lot of fun!  But it can be disappointing if the customer service people do not come through for you.	1
With triplet boys I love puzzles that don't have too many pieces. This is a great buy! At 2 years old the triplets are not independently matching the vehicles, but with my help they have so much fun listening to the sounds!	1
Got it for my then 14mo son for Christmas, and he still loves it (now 18mo). A good learn-and-play toy - he likes findings the two parts of different cars, and he gets very excited when he makes the toy make a sound. I like M&D toys.	1
very nice for little ones perfect size for little hands to pick up and the sounds are great i liked it	1
My two year old grandson could not do this puzzle without help.  You have to get the blocks in straight to make the sound.  However, a more patient child could certainly learn to do it, and my grandson loved the noises and sirens.	1
It's a great  developmental toy IMO, but I wish pictures were pained not glued on -  my 1y.o chewed off a piece of a picture.	1
We bought this for my four year old daughter as a gift. I was a bit nervous that the ladybugs wouldn't make it as many of the reviews had mentioned, but decided to take the chance anyway. I was happy I did. Surprisingly, every single one of our larva turned into a ladybug. I think I was more excited than my daughter to watch the transformation into ladybugs. My daughter did enjoy keeping the watering pad moist to "care" for the little critters. One of our ladybugs was a bit of a late bloomer. I thought for sure he didn't make it, but two days after the rest had emerged from their pupa, that one finally did.	1
This is a really cool house and teaches kids about a ladybug life cycle. Who knew the actually have a cocoon stage. The larvae arrived with most of them alive and was available in February. The only thing I didn't expect was I had to pay for shipping and handling on the ladybug larvae. House seller was good and item arrived on time in good condition.	1
What's the point of paying for Amazon Prime when packages keep arriving late????  It doesn't matter how fun a toy is for a 3 year old, when it comes the day AFTER their birthday!!!	-1
Wonderful idea that keeps even older kids entertained. I'm not a fan of toys that make noise but these noises are fairly quiet and not annoying at all.	1
Got this for 1 yr. old.  He can't match the blocks yet, but his sisters match them and he likes the sounds and playing with the blocks.	1
love the toys give them to many people.really a great gift thanks so very very very much. Thanks thanks thanks thanks	1
Like another reviewer, I also received a tube of what looked like dead larvae.  Only 1 was alive in the end.  I called up Customer Service and was on the phone waiting to talk to a live person for 50 minutes!  Finally got through to someone & they said they would send some more.  Nothing yet though.  The actual ladybug land is very cheaply made and the children can easily pull the top off & then the ladybugs can escape.  So just beware.	-1
Nice insect cage we get it for my kids class so they can see the butterfly's grow they are really enjoying it	1
Because furry pets weren't enough	1
My seven year old grandson says this is "awesome."	1
Great to keep around the house all the time for bug collection.	1
I think it is 2 or 3 already, we are using it each summer, not strong to be use for two season, but cheap enough to buy for a kid again...	1
Any little bug explorer would love this!	1
My 2-year old received this for Christmas.  Within the first 5 minutes, he scraped his little teeth over the front ambulance metallic bump.  It came right off and was in his mouth.  Because I was right next to him, I got it out.  I emailed directly to Melissa and Doug, but I never heard anything back from them.	-1
I bought these for my daycare children and they love them. These are great for my 1 year old great sounds great price.	1
I purchased this toy for my son and although the toy is the same great quality we have come to expect from Melissa and Doug, the blocks are a little small.	1
I got these blocks for my son when he was two. It took him a while to get the idea of how to make the pictures line up properly, but he really liked the sound effects he got when he did it right. The sounds were encouragement enough to make him want to keep trying. Now at three, he does them right every time.	1
I bought this kit for the library I work at in Utah, so that the children could come in and watch the ladybugs grow as a part of our Catch the Reading Bug summer reading program.  It was a big hit!  We had to order them again, because the kids were sad we released the ladybugs.  The first time we did it, however, out of the 12 ladybugs, only three made it to adult.  The second time we had better luck.  We currently have six of 10 that turned into adults. I wouldn't be surprised if we have some eggs in the habitat pretty soon.  The butterfly kits were a big success as well.  We had one handicap butterfly, but he/she learned to fly just fine.  We ended up having 8 of 10 turn into butterflies (despite the fact that three of the chrysalis fell down).  As for some having dead ladybugs arrive, it's possible that the environments they were shipped through were too hot for them. You may want to consider contacting the company first if you're worried about the larvae arriving alive. All of our ladybugs arrived alive, so I can't be sure why this problem occurred.  As for Oregon residents who bought this kit, unfortunately most companies won't ship ladybugs to Oregon, but try googling live ladybug kits.  There may be a company out there who will ship to Oregon.	1
This small sized carrier seems the perfect size for children. It doesn't take up too much room.  It came quickly and is ready for my classroom.	1
this is basically the smaller version of the large butterfly house. my little girl loves to catch butterflies and other insects and then she will transfer them into this little "house" and carry them around. it's cute.	1
I usually love Melissa and Doug, but these blocks are below their usual standards.  The pictures are warping.  Was disappointed with the quality of the sounds.  Both the blocks and the base are heavy so if your child is into throwing things I wouldn't buy this for safety reasons.	-1
We wanted to purchase more traditional toys for our daughter for christmas 06.  We bought a lot of M&D toys and this by far was the better of their toys.  Even though our daughter is still a little young to put pieces together properly it will be even better when she figures this out.  Like other said the sound is very appropriate.  I like this toy and definitely recommend this to others. The only reason I gave it a 4 is colors on blocks could be a bit brighter or more colorful.	1
This was so much fun and so educational we had the best time checking them every day. And even when it was time to let the lady bugs go free it was a fun day. Now everytime we see a ladybug my daughter says thats one of my ladybugs coming to see me. I reccomend this for any child.	1
We were so excited to try this out with our little boy, but it was not what we expected.  The only exciting day of insect watching came the day that the shipment arrived from Insect Lore - the ladybug larvae moved around a lot for about a day, then hid for almost 5 days while they turned into ladybugs.  Once they were ladybugs, they just sat around and didn't do anything (they only seemed to move when we weren't looking at them).  Then they died.  Wow, what a letdown. Next time, we'll go with an old-fashioned ant farm!	-1
I made the mistake of not reading the reviews and like others have said..it's much smaller than it appears.  My daughter likes it, but it is SMALL.	1
This was a good deal and has provided hours of backyard fun. We got some mangnifying glasses to go with it, too!	1
This is a great thing to have handy during the summer or anytime.  My daughter catches all the caterpillars she can and she keeps them in this port a bug bag.  After a while we have...moths not butterflies but she stilll loves it.  They are amazing to watch as they hatch and learn to fly.	1
container for transporting monarch butterflies. I rear Monarchs, and this is great to take them for tagging... I purchased 4 more, when they went on sale, wish I had gotten more... highly recommend	1
My kids just LOVE these bug holders, they are soft mesh, and have a plastic covering on the end that opens with a zipper thats see through. They fold up great, the little holder is a huge bonus, it has velcro too that also keeps it folded if its not in the case. My kids just love running around collecting bug, and I just have to remember to let their critters go at night. Durable, cute, perfect for children!!!	1
When this first arrived I was unsure of how much it would be used.  the shape seemed a bit odd an I was unsure how sturdy the screening would be.  Our three and a half year old has a variety of about 5 bug houses and he like this one and another that has a handle on it and looks more like a lnch box shape the best.  He has always got them all filled with a variety of bugs and he even can tote them to his preschool class.  The handle is a great asset here.  I would highly recommend this.	1
Easy to use and store - this bug house is fun to own.  I've given it to kids of various ages, and when combined with a butterfly net and possibly a book for identifying what's seen in nature, this is a terrific kit/gift!	1
My son is an avid bug catcher and he has had one of these for two years now. He is hard on his toys, especially bug paraphernalia. It's EXCELLENT construction and is great for storing bugs/bees/butterflies/etc. It's held up really well over the years. It's not the one that comes with caterpillars - this is just the container, but definitely worth it.	1
Boring & Not Suitable for Independent Play,  this toy wasn't really designed with babies in mind, not even older babies.  Toddlers in the 2+ range can probably figure out how to turn it on and off and activate the few songs it sings.	-1
My son received this for his first birthday, but wasn't actually very interested in it until he was almost two.  He would get frustrated trying to get Tad to talk (he also has the hug and learn Tad, which is much easier) and he didn't understand why the counting would "stop" because he couldn't grasp that he was supposed to be looking in the book at the items named.  He really likes this toy now, at age two.  I would save this toy for an older toddler.	1
Oh My Gosh...My nephew loves this Learning Friend (Tad) But!!! it gets annoying after awhile singing after awhile i have to put this toy up and let him play with his baby blocks and he screams for tad so i give it to him and the songs he sings Gets stuck in my head and we know them all but its a good "learning" toy for infants to toddlers!!  "Hi, I'm Tad." "Hola, soy Tad." Tad  a bilingual frog that helps kids learn counting and colors in English and Spanish. (Press his left foot to switch from English to Spanish.) This cuddly 14-inch plush amphibian is dressed in orange overalls with numbers on the belly, which, when squeezed, make Tad sing catchy little songs. Tad carries a fabric booklet with numbered objects from 1 to 10 corresponding to his songs: "How many buttons, tell me, do you see? One, two." Exposing children to a foreign language early on helps them distinguish the sounds of their own language from another, and leads to a greater ability to learn foreign languages later in life.  Learning Friend Tad makes learning fun as he musically introduces counting, colors and objects on his body. Squeeze him once to hear a counting 1-10 song. Squeeze him again to hear a song about colors and the objects on His shirt. Then with a simple press of his foot, you can switch all of his learning songs to Spanish! Press his foot again and switch back to English. This bilingual pal will be a friend for life!	1
Another one of those inexpensive Chrismas presents that turned out to be the best!!  We sneak up on each other with it.  The ball of air it sends across a room is mind blowing!  My teenagers and their friends have so much fun with this that we are getting a bunch for the holidays this year!!  Air Wars!!!  Awesome product!	1
this is my family's happiest, noisiest game.......just when you think you'll win, someone swaps with you....oh no! ....just when you are almost out of cards, you miss the slap ....and have to collect extra cards.... our family rule that keeps us laughing the most: if you slap the deck when you are not meant to, you have to go around the table and give everyone a hug, saying "sorry, i didn't mean to slap the deck that time" ....... my son TRIES so hard to get others to slap ...... but he's awfully quick to make an accidental slap himself.....great fun.......even the youngest can master it and get in on the antics......	1
The AirZooka is a rather large toy that launches a blast of air up to 20' or so. We gave this to my son for Christmas and it turned out to be a surprise hit! The AirZooka was a little hard for my son to assemble on his own, but he was eventually able to get it.  Everyone (young and old) had a lot of fun playing with this toy and the cats soon learned to go upstairs when anyone picked it up (Note: No animals were harmed in the writing of this review :-)  Recommended!	1
Who knew that a piece of plastic could be so fun!  It literally sends an air bullet with enough force to startle you.  I bought one of these for my husband and one for my daughter for Christmas last year.  It may as well have been the only gift I bought because once they put these together (a bit of a pain) it was all they wanted to play with.  Soon, the entire neighborhood was getting them and having air wars.  They are a great, inexpensive, gift for any occasion and fun for all ages.	1
As usual, these puzzles are the best!  The type of puzzle you can keep for generations!	1
This is an easy game to learn to play and moves quickly. I've played this game with teenagers, kids, and adults and it is equally fun with any age group. How often do you get to slap someone and laugh about it! Don't get too attached to your hand because someone will take it away! Great card game.	1
Great fun toy!  Very large!	1
Bought this for my daughter who is 5. Unfortunately she isn't quite strong enough to pull the trigger back, but honestly I kind of just took the toy over.  This thing is great, you can launch a ball of air across the house and mess with everyone.  The dog hates me right now.  It is only getting 4 stars because it is hard to pull back.	1
Crapola.  Not recommended.  Also you have to put this crapola together yourself. It broke while we were trying to.	-1
These are fun. you will love them	1
Not much	-1
Great fun, my nephew loved it as a gift, and it really does throw an air bomb at its targets.	1
Got this as a gift for a co-worker, and it has proven to be quite a hit in the office.  People learned quickly to recognize the sound of the diaphragm being pulled back.	1
This is one of our family favorites! We have so much fun with this game. I love games where the energy level is high and everyone ends up laughing. This is one of those games. It is fast paced, unpredictable and just loads of fun. Our two oldest boys are 10 and 8 and this is one of their favorite games.	1
Now, I have not played this game in a while, because I keep getting new ones I want to try out.  However, I just wanted to write a little review.  We love this game.  It is great fun and we have played and played it.  We had an impromptu game day at my sisters and they all loved this game...there were quite a few of us too!  I don't love the slapping part when you are playing with big muscle bound guys, but with my kids it is great.  I definitely would recommend this game!	1
This is a really cool toy. It is large and is not easy for a small child to handle	1
Worked great for our inventor at VBS.  It withstood various rehearsals and a lot of kids after our skits.  Good quality product at a nice price.	1
Received.	1
Fun fun fun. As advertised and have not had any issues with it as of yet	1
GRANDSON LOVED IT	1
to big	-1
Soooo fun	1
it is fun to use on the kids and see them smile	1
A blast!	1
Ordered the 48 piece dinosaur puzzle by Melissa & Doug and received the 24 piece by mistake. After calling and speaking to a representative they let me keep the 24 piece and also sent the 48 piece replacement. My two boys aged 1 and 2 love the Melissa and Doug toys and the puzzles are of a great quality as well.	1
Great puzzles as always	1
WOW! Big and sturdy.  Big pieces for small hands makes them easy to put together. My 5 yo grandson loves it.	1
Another great-quality puzzle from Melissa and Doug.  Thick, sturdy pieces and vibrant colors.  Please don't ever stop making them.  This is my fifth purchase.	1
When I first got it I was worried it would be flimsy but it's actually pretty sturdy.  The rubber bands are strong and have held up to a lot of use!  It's been used for about every prank you could think of and we have a lot of fun with it.	1
This was a Christmas gift for someone. It was a big hit! Started off "What is that?" and turned into "Stop it! Let me try it! Hit me with it! Try and hit that! Hit Grandma!" with everyone - ages ranging from 20-something to 80-something wanting to play with it. I'm sure kids would love it even more. It does seem like the plastic inside might break pretty easily, and it is more of a novelty than an every day toy, so you will want to make sure you aren't paying too much for it.	1
Our kids are practical jokers so I thought they would have fun with this. They used it for half a day and it has sat in the closet ever since. It's good quality and the concept is fun, but our kids just aren't into it I guess.	-1
Good for kids that love dinosaurs...	1
My 4 year old loves this.	1
Fantastic gift for my 6 y/o grandson - he loves Dinos and floor puzzles - he can put it together faster than I can!	1
Beautiful puzzle!!	1
Got this for my son for Christmas. Almost impossible to put together,  instructions vague.  He barely played with it, we "shot it" a few times, and the bladder that creates the air action came apart from the toy and it is now useless. Stay away from this toy, it seemed like such a fun idea but it was a big disappointment.	-1
Fantastic fun.  Shoots a blast of air across the room, people are baffled and surprised. Fill it with smoke and fire giant smoke rings!  Sadly, the retaining ring for the flexible membrane came off after a day of adult use.  I guess I have to agree, buy a nerf gun.	-1
We had a couple of these years ago for our kids. I thought it might be fun to bring them back this Christmas only this time it will be my husband and I "shooting" each other while our kids roll their eyes at us.	1
I own a Vape Store and this is fun to shoot giant vape rings!	1
Good	1
3.5 year old and grandma did together.  He put together the T- rex while I helped with the rest. Solidly made.	1
large, awesome, my son loves it.	1
Great puzzle. Complex enough that kids can have fun. Size is perfect for a floor puzzle. Recommended.	1
After a month, I can finally say this puzzle is awesome all around. We pull this out when the cousins are over and spend 30+ minutes using our minds to try and piece this perfectly illustrated giant puzzle together. The pieces are thick and of good quality. We have a big family who needs big products like this one ! Superb puzzle and affordable price.	1
Loved the gorgeous box! Gift for a 6 year old boy dinosaur enthusiast. You will not be disappointed!	1
It was meant as a birthday present for my 2 year old, but my 5 year old daughter enjoys building this as well. We build out puzzles in the kitchen so pieces can often get either bent or dirty. These pieces however are very sturdy, and they have been dirty already and wiped clean without difficulty. Nice feature with a chart naming the dinosaurs in the puzzle, as well as they appear anatomically correct.	1
cool toy which all kids love	1
Fun, but kid only played with it a couple of times. Pieces are well made.	1
My grandson loved this puzzle.  He will be turning 4 in a few months and is really into a good challenge!  The order was very prompt and I enjoyed following the tracking number and knowing when it reached his house.	1
Very satisfied with this product and service.	1
good quality pieces that fit well and should last from kid to kid.	1
kids enjoy this.	1
Gave as gifts and they loved them!	1
Great product, challenging enough for children between 4-5 and well made	1
My 4 y/o loves this (and all the other Melissa and Doug dinosaur floor puzzles)!	1
It's Great.  I read the reviews and ordered with confidence and the product has delivered the reviewers' promise.  A special bonus is the labeling of the planets and the sun and the moon.  My 5 year old granddaughter keeps looking for Pluto, which I've explained is no longer considered a planet.  There are enough extra planetary bodies in the puzzle that she has fun trying to figure out which is Pluto.  The asteroid belt is prominently displayed and we had a very interesting conversation about the exploded planet theory.	1
Great puzzle- great quality. My 3 year old puzzle fanatic loves it!	1
Nice size but my son didn't want it after completing it about 2-3 times	1
My 4 yr old has been putting this puzzle together on almost a daily basis. I had to buy some more (different scenes) so that she doesn't get too bored, but it's definitely a lot of fun! Also, the pieces are very sturdy and the colors are bright. Definitely a great puzzle for little hands!	1
My son loves this puzzle! We can put it together on the floor no problem. The pieces are thick and he loves all the different dinosaurs.	1
Beautiful and huge. Just right for a 3 year old learning to make puzzles.	1
Fun, novel idea, easy to assemble and the kids love it. It is bigger than expected, but that doesn't hurt anything. The air shoots you! Who would have ever thought of that?!?!?	1
Bought it for our nephew for Christmas & loved it.  I was a little hard for him, 8, to pull back.  But that meant that he couldn't get us with the full impact.  Could still pull it.	1
My Son wanted this for Christmas.  He loves it.  He thinks it is fun to go outside and shoot things with this air gun.	1
My son used to love to play with his foam swords and have fights with his friends. But boys will be boys and those foam swords can cause some ouchies when they really get riled up.  With these my son and his friends can do battle and there is no contact.  So far no injuries or timeouts!	1
I bought this for my 9 yr old son. It does have to be put together and its very simple however; it didn't want to snap. I had to really give it some elbow grease and then I couldn't get the 'screws' to go in and had to hand it over to my husband. His words where "well i had to turn them alot harder than I was suppose to but they're in" Well worth it!!! We've all played with it!!	1
nice puzzle==kids loved it, fast delivery and large pieces for easier assembly.	1
After I open it, I imagine it will deserve 5 stars. Will open next weekend for great-grandson's birthday. All of Melissa and Doug's toys are great.	1
Fun!	1
My son loves dinosaurs and this makes him want to learn more.  He is 5 and is able to do this puzzle completely on his own.  You need space, but it is fun.  The quality is GREAT.	1
Great sturdy puzzle. Big pieces. Perfect for my 4 year old. Very colorful. Great construction. I would recommend this to anyone with a toddler.	1
Granddaughter went through a puzzle phase from about 4 to 6 and she loved this. she is on to other things now but she had great fun with this for two years.	1
I got this air gun for my grandson, age almost 5 yrs old, for Christmas. I know he will love this!!	1
This is a blast - no pun intended.  It is easy to assemble, I used one of these for 3 years before it wore out.  I used it in my middle school classroom-the kids loved the attention.	1
It's fun for kids and adults who will let themselves be silly enough to use it.  Makes a great gift for the little trouble maker in your life .	1
We like the AirZooka. The kids have fun with it. The parts don't fit together very well but it is still usable. Fun gun but a little cheap.	1
What a great puzzle for dinosaur crazy kids.  Our 4, 3, and 2 1/2 Grandkids, all boys, love this puzzle and ask for it all the time.  Well made and colorful	1
Very sturdy floor puzzle. Great design and perfect size for my son. Another great on for Melissa and Doug co.!	1
My 3 year old and I do a puzzle every night before bedtime to relax and wind down the evening. His favorite are floor puzzles. I really like this puzzle because it is a floor puzzle so it is big enough for both of us to do together and it also poses a little bit of a challenge and isn't too easy for him to do. There are lots of dinosaurs on the puzzle and it makes for a good conversation piece between us. It is also a good quality puzzle and heavy duty.	1
I got this for my grandkids. One of them is 3 1/2 years old and is obsessed with dinosaurs. They love putting this puzzle together and counting the dinosaurs. They are also learning the names of the dinosaurs.	1
Although the quality is pretty cheap and this might not last too long, all three kids love it. I even had fun using it.  You can feel it easily across a room or two and when the air goes by your ear it sounds like a book.  Its lots of fun and easy to assemble.	1
The plastic handle is my only complaint. After assembly (which is a little difficult) we had a lot of fun playing with the two we bought but noticed that soon the rough plastic handle hurts your hand. Maybe they could make it with a softer rubber handle or we could all just wear gloves when playing. It definitely scares the dog and cat.	1
We purchased this for our nephew for his 4th birthday who is enthralled with all the dinosaurs right now. He loved it & we are happy with the quality.	1
Again a Made in China product. My great nephew loves dinosaurs so he is happy. Was looking for made in the USA toys.	1
Great fun puzzle. Its a little on the easy side, my son is five. But I like that because of its size, he will take it out and build it quickly.	1
Almost impossible to put together... The "ring" that holds the plastic bag fell off during assembly- even with the help of additional people could not get it back on. The "holes" on top don't line up even though the bottom assembly is in place so no way to fix that.  The plastic "grip" is so flimsy I could never trust using this thing- the force required to pull the bag back enough to be fun could easily rip this out of the hand of a child or young adult. As a 6'4" full grown man I had a hard time holding onto it, and of course the bag falls off since that ring won't go back on.  A dangerous joke. Avoid at all costs.	-1
I ordered two of these for my nephew. When they arrived, they required assembly; however, the plastic parts are so warped and made with such low quality, that I could only assemble one. (It took hours to assemble the one that finally went together). Once assembled, the gun still wouldn't function properly because the gun needs to withstand a pretty significant amount of force to snap the cannon. Every time we tried to use the gun, it fell into pieces again. Between myself, my husband, my brother, mother and father, none of us could get these guns to snap together or stay in one piece. (To provide some perspective: We are two engineers, a computer programmer, a statistician, registered nurse, and a construction project manager).  Over all, the quality is terrible. We returned both guns for a full refund. The idea is cool...but, don't buy this one. Find another Air Gun made by someone else!! The quality of this product is TERRIBLE. Even though I received a full refund, I wasted a lot of time repackaging and taking the box to a shipping center to facilitate the refund. I have nothing positive to say about this product. I would assess it at 0 stars if possible.	-1
This toy is so much fun.  It is kind of hard to pull back the band to release it, so it would not be recommended for smaller childred, 7 and up only.  It is really fun toy!!!	1
I love the large Melissa and Doug puzzles. My four-year-old wasn't into puzzles until I purchased several of the jumbo-sized and now he loves them. The pieces are large and sturdy, and the picture is bright and fun. The quality is excellent, particularly for the price.	1
I bought this for my grandchildren and they love it!  Colors are awesome and pieces are heavy duty.  A must buy if your children love dinosaurs.	1
They love it and you cant hurt anything with it..but don't let them do it to the bird in the house..trust me on this one.	1
The Airzooka is a rather large toy that launches a blast of air up to 20' or so. We gave this to my son for Christmas and it turned out to be a surprise hit! The Airzooka was a little hard for my son to assemble on his own, but he was eventually able to get it.  Everyone (young and old) had a lot of fun playing with this toy and the cats soon learned to go upstairs when anyone picked it up (Note: No animals were harmed in the writing of this review :-)  Recommended!	1
My 3 yr old grandson loves dinosaurs.  Regular puzzles are still a bit challenging for him, but the very simple "figure on a peg" puzzles are too simple. This is a great middle ground and he loves the BIG size. The artwork is of high quality, as one can expect with Melissa and Doug products.  Would highly recommend.	1
I bought as a Christmas gift for my four year old son. We have played it and it was enjoyable. Good construction of puzzle pieces.	1
My son loves this present for Christmas. It's huge and is a nice picture The pieces are of a decent quality too	1
Our grand kids love these puzzles.  Great quality!  I don't want to write any more about this review.  Why do I have to write a certain amount of words.  Quit this or I won't review any more purchases!!!!	1
Melissa & Doug floor puzzles have the best quality of any puzzle we've ever owned. They have great pictures, my kids love putting them together over and over.	1
We gave this puzzle to our grandson for his 4th birthday & he not only wants to play it every time he comes over but plays it over & over.  The pieces are large, colorful, smooth & sturdy although a couple corners are bent already.  The plastic coated poster of the puzzle is great for helping to put it together & the dinosaurs are labelled.  He likes that the puzzle is large & has lots of colorful, detailed dinosaurs.  We usually put the T-rex together first & work from there.  We talk about their names & colors & features.  This is the first puzzle with this many pieces that he has been able to put together himself (with help).  I think he'll play with this for quite a while & the pieces are sturdy enough that his 2 year old sister can "help" us.	1
Got this floor puzzle for our grandson.  He's really into dinosaurs and spends a lot of time putting the puzzle together, naming the dinosaurs, taking it back apart and starting over.  He loves the puzzle.	1
My grandson loves puzzles. He couldn't wait to open the puzzle and put it together. The subject matter is great for the immagination. It is a good thing to exercise the mind.	1
This puzzle has nice firm pieces that are durable and appear to be long lasting (we've only had it for about one month).  It also came with a poster showing the completed puzzle and all the dinosaurs labeled with their names.  Six-year-old approved!  If you want one of these puzzles made in the USA and NOT China, then I suggest going into a store (i.e. Lakeshore Learning) and checking out the box for its source before you buy (you can find the country of origin in small wording near the product SKU).  This company makes puzzles in both the USA and China; the one I purchased through Amazon happened to be 'Made in China.'	1
Bought this as a gift for a friend's son for his 4th bday. He loved it. Big and sturdy. Hard enough for him to have to work at it with his mom but not so hard that he was frustrated. She said it was a great next step from the puzzles he'd been doing and he loves the dinosaurs.	1
I got this puzzle for my daughter for her third birthday and she just loves the bright colors and the vivid images of the bugs and flowers. The first time it was completed she was so amazed by how pretty it looked and insisted on using it as a napping pad! Each piece is distinct enough to tell apart, and the adjacent pieces usually share some common feature (such as a bright-colored pedal or a wing of a dragonfly), so that even though she is challenged, she can complete it by herself after some time. In that sense the puzzle is great for fostering patience and building confidence. It's been two months and she still plays with it. Recently I brought it to my office and now we can both have our "quiet time" when she visits.	1
Bought this for my preschool classroom. The kids love it! :)	1
My transitional kindergarten students love this puzzle! It was hard for them at first but once they'd put it together a few times, they got pretty fast at it.  Lots of bugs to name. Can make up other games too, like placing mini bug manipulatives that match on the pictures of the puzzles. We also had fun counting how many of each insect there are.	1
My 3.5 year old has been learning about bugs in preschool and he loves puzzles, so I bought him this.  He absolutely loves it.  The quality is good.  Unlike some other floor puzzles I have gotten for him, the pieces all interlock (so they stay together).  The pieces are huge (like 4 or 5" wise) so I have no idea how this qualifies as a "choking hazard" unless little kids manage to take a bite off of a piece.  Once the puzzle is together, we look for different types of bugs and count them (ie - how many butterflies, etc).  He likes to take it apart and do it all over again.  This is our first Melisssa & Doug floor puzzle and I will definitely check out others.	1
I love Melissa & Doug floor puzzles!  We almost have the entire collection, and I think this one about Bugs ranks as one of my favorites.  The pieces are big and easy to assemble.  You can tell that this one was well cut as nothing needs to be forced and the puzzle lays nice and flat when assembled.  The graphics are exciting and detailed, giving parents and kids lots of cool things to talk about when everything is put together and it's time to step back and admire your work!  The pale green background lets the bugs take center stage, and kids will delight in finding caterpillars, butterflies, ants, ladybugs, bees, and grasshoppers just to name a few.  This puzzle is very surprisingly narrow, which thrilled my puzzle maker.  He was expecting a square and was surprised to find a puzzle that was only three pieces high!  It provides a nice panoramic view.  The puzzle pieces are very sturdy and I expect that this puzzle will hold up for a long time, much like our other Melissa & Doug products.  This is an enthusiastic recommend for preschoolers just getting used to putting together 24 piece puzzles.  This is a solid investment for any young bug lover.	1
This is another nice floor puzzle. We can never get too many of these! This has a nice natural picture and is sturdy.	1
I was a little weary at first but helping my daughter do this floor puzzle is so much fun and she loves it!	1
I'm not sure how this toy ended up with a 4.5 star rating after all the broken microphones!! Ours was yet another that broke within 2 months of gentle play. It wasn't thrown or dragged around by the microphone or anything of the sort. My son loved it and figured out the microphone very quickly. He loved to see the lights and the little puppy "dance" when he "sang" into the microphone. I continued to let him play with it even after the microphone shorted out and the static began and he still kept trying the microphone until he got frustrated and then I finally put it away. I wish I had spent the money on something that would have lasted longer. My son is now 18 months old and the only other toy he has ever managed to break was the Vtech Nursery Farm which was broken 3 weeks after Christmas last year, just before this piano broke. I highly recommend Fisher Price or LeapFrog toys over Vtech. We have never had a problem with their toys and 2 of the 3 Vtech toys we have owned have broken on us. Garbage!!	-1
We bought this for my son when he was 6 mths old. He is now 10 mths old and still likes to play with this toy. The songs, games, colors, and such my son loves. The microphone is the best feature for us because our son loves to sing into it. Our only complaint is that after a few slobber attempts at singing occur the microphone stops working properly. Also the speakers if slobbered on start to crackle and make sounds sound distorted. Great toy but does not last very long with a teether (periodic drooler) or constant drooler.  Our son did like the toy so much that we considered buying another one but the price was too high to purchase a second one that may not last more than a few months.  Personal note: my son has lost four toys due to his drooling cousin. If your child is a heavy drooler I would not consider toys such as these because they do not last long. We now put eletronic toys away when he comes to visit.	1
I bought this toy for my friends daughters first birthday and it was at our house for about a week before we gave it to her. In that time my 3 month old daughter fell in love with it as well.  This is a great piano with a lot of different things to explore and play with. There are 5 keys which have a different color, animal and musical instrument represented by each key. It has a drum and sound effects joy stick as well as a karaoke microphone! There is a little dog that moves back in forth to time with the music who is "the leader" of the band.  There are different modes of play with this piano as well. When one mode is chosen you play the keys as its a piano. Another mode allows the name of the color of the key to be said as well as the animal and the type of sound the animal makes. Then another mode plays the style of music represented by the instrument on the key. You have classical, jazz, country and an island type jamaican tune with a few others. The drum counts each pat you make or just acts as a drum. And the sound effects joy stick and karaoke microphone are just too much fun!  My friend said her daughter loves to play with the microphone to sing.  There are lots of lights on here to interest a younger baby. My daughter just loved to listen to the music and watch the lights. I think they should change the reccomended age on this toy to a younger age. Even if your baby cant sit up on her own you can hold this toy with her on your lap and they will like to explore it and look at it. As they get older they will get more interactive.  A fabulous toy at a great price. And the music sounds good too which is a plus!	1
This is the only electronic toy you need! My 10 month old just got this and she plays w/ it for at least 30 min at a time, a couple times a day.  The 3 modes, five piano type keys, 4 directional joy-stick, drum, microphone, guitar playing dog, and 15 LED lights provide a smorgasbord of musical and educational fun. Counting/Colors/Animals Mode: tap the drum and hear the beats being counted.  Press the keys for the color and/or animal name featured on the key and a short tune in the instrument featured on the key. Listen Mode: each key starts a new classic or nursery song; add animal noises by pressing the keys, drum beats by tapping the drum, puppy noise by pressing pumpy's head, and 4 other funny noises by moving the joy-stick. Swirl the joy-stick to speed up the music and hold it down to slow the music. Sing along using the real microphone. Play Mode: make your own music using the keys, drum, and joy-stick. Practicallity: uses easy to find, always on hand AA batteries. Features auto shut-off after inactivity to preserve battery life, but can be switched off to prevent accidental activation, etc.  2 volumes (I think the lowest is loud enough, and could be just a bit quieter, but still, I haven't gotten annoyed yet because of all the variety.) Bottom Line: This is the most action-packed electronic toy out there and at a very good price too. It is the only one of its kind that you will need, and you do need it.	1
Intially I purchased this piano for a friend's daughter who celebrated her 1st birthday.  When wrapping the gift, I discovered all the things this piano does.  I then was on a mission to purchase one as a Christmas gift for our 4th son (who celebrated his 1st birthday days before Christmas). There were only 3 things under the tree that he played with Christmas morning.  The Rock 'n Bounce Zebra, a ball and the Sing & Discover Piano!!  He discovered very quickly how the microphone works!  I love the dog that moves along with the music.  This piano has it all...a "drum", a microphone, a sound effect feature, the moving puppy and plenty of lights. You have different ways of playing the piano, as well.  Manually, preset songs, animal noises, etc!!	1
This is a great kit. We did run out of the sticky stuff, but we have popcorn ceilings, which required a little extra tack. Regular stick-tack works fine though. The stars are a lot of fun to look at with my son as he settles down for the night.	1
Very good toy. Detailed, good quality plastic.  Water hose is fun. Everything works and as described. Happy with it.	1
Very nice, much nicer than expected. Have not given this to child yet.	1
I love this truck and can't believe it's price. It has a lot of cool features. My son and my nephews love it, and so do I.	1
Nicely built. Realistic design but I wish the ladder was made with a little thicker plastic because as it goes up pretty far, it seems to become more fragile.  Substantial size that adds fun to thr childs imagination. I also wish the Bruder characters would come with their vehicle instead of sold separate	1
My grandson loves his firetruck. He is 3 and it was his favorite Christmas gift! It is bigger than I expected, but well built.	1
such a fun realistic toy truck	1
Better than that the Grandsons loved it. Like the other 3-4 Bruder trucks we bought, it large and well made and despite a lot of moving parts they seem to hold up well - I've been surprised at what hasn't broken off despite very rough play by the 2-year old... the five year old handles it with a lot more care and precision and enjoys operating the controls. They come over here a couple of times a week and it always holds their attention.	1
My three year old grandson loves fire engines and specifically asked for a Bruder  fire engine for his birthday. He loves it and it is so cute watching him play with it. The fire engine is well made and sturdy. The hose and pump are a real plus. He loves putting the ladder up and down.	1
One of the best toy fire trucks I have ever seen. It is huge! Definitely a favorite for my 3 year old.	1
So much detail! our 3 year old is fire truck obsessed, and this one has every perfect detail for him! Has been very sturdy, although we make sure he doesn't ride it like he does his similar sized tonka fire truck.  Pump action on the fire hose works great! Can't wait for our next bruder vehicle!	1
Great product for great price!	1
A high quality fire truck. Made of great quality in Germany. We researched the Amazon website looking for the best one This one stood out from the recommendations or five from other buyers. We like the details of the truck and the material it is paid off. I would buy another  one again.  Our four-year-old toddler son will be very happy Christmas with this truck.	1
GRANDKID TOY	1
My boys love this fire truck. The really enjoy using the "real" water hose to put out fires.	1
Excellent product as you can expect from Bruder.  This is the second one purchased as older brother absolutely wore  out the first one after 3 years of play.	1
really bright	1
My  2 1/2 year old son is obsessed with this truck. He especially loves the fire hose. We have not used the water feature yet because I am sure that will be awesome, yet a constant clean up :) He loves the extendable ladder and its the perfect fire truck for "putting out fires" on his older sisters Barbie Dream house.	1
You can't go wrong with Bruder.  My son loves their trucks.	1
My three-year-old son loves this fire truck. It makes noise, lights up, has an extendable ladder, and you can pump water out of the hose.  I wanted to write this review to let everyone know that we ordered the "frustration free packaging" and it was the exact same as the regular Bruder packaging, but about $15 less expensive. Normally, this is not the case and the frustration free packaging is just an easy to open, nondescript, brown box.  We own several of these Bruder Trucks because they are extremely durable and my son loves them. My son has already thrown this fire truck down our double concrete step that leads to our patio and it escaped damage.  This truck is a winner.	1
My boy is 18.5 months he loves it. The small parts, I remove. Plus, I monitor the play. My six year-old loves it. This rocks. Pricey, but worth it - I bought them a lot of Bruder for the realism and functionality.	1
Solid quality. Very nice toy for any child (mine is 5).	1
My son loves this. Teaches him about transportation and keeps him busy with no mess. Easy for on the go as well	1
Great for imagination, great for creativity, my wife loves this as does my son.	1
I use these create a scene magnet boards with my preschool aged students in their speech therapy sessions. It has versatility in that I can work on articulation, spatial concepts, building longer sentences, grammar, etc. It packs easy which is important when you are a traveling therapist and toting bags of toys everywhere.  Lastly, these work well when providing a child-directed approach with my more challenging  students. Keep the scene boards coming! I already have the farm, beach, firefighter and now the transportation board. I look forward to owning more!	1
This truck is fantastic.  Great Quality lots of fun extras, moving ladder, sprays water, stabilizers, lights & sounds.  My 8 year old LOVES it.	1
Bought this for Christmas for my 6 year old grandson.  He really loves it and plays with it daily.	1
Put these in my kids room. Very cool decoration for kid's room.	1
Great truck!	1
Wonderful for a two year old for Christmas, I was really impressed with the durability and good craftsmanship. And you can even get parts. The only thing missing was instructions listing everything the truck can do. Hope we did not miss anything	1
Best made toy ever. The whole line is superior.	1
My MIL bought my daughter a Kettler tricycle, I believe at Toys R Us, for around $39. I was surprised and happy they make a Kettler trike in a lower price range, and it even came with a yellow bucket/trailer behind the seat for storing stuff. My daughter was 2-1/2 (she's small, too) and was not "getting" the concept of keeping her feet on the pedals, so I spent some back-breaking time leaned over, pushing her down the block on the thing so I could push and steer at the same time.  When I found out the push bar was only $16, I went for it, not even knowing if it would attach to the low-end model. IT DID!!! Right where the seat is mounted, there is a rounded-yet-triangular tubular opening, that's where the bar slides in. I was soooo impressed that all the models have interchangeable parts like that, what great design.  The best news is that within ONE DAY of me pushing my daughter with the bar (telling her to keep her feet on the pedals as I push), she was able to understand how to keep her feet on the pedals by herself and actually pedalled it herself!  The directions say not to use the bar as a lever to lift the trike at all, but I lift it all the time in order to correct my daughter's amateur attempts at steering! So far, so good.  This bar has enabled us to actually use our wonderful Kettler tricycle... it helped my daughter learn to pedal within one day, and has saved my back!	1
Awesome! Best engine yet. Sound doesnt make your head hurt,like most kid toys. Firehose is sweet.	1
Grandson loves it.  It shoots water too!  Well made and a good size.	1
Excellent.  Our grandson - 2.5 years old - lovers playing with all of the moving parts	1
Tin very light but still a great game	1
So cheap!!  I threw it away after we tried to play once!!	-1
I bought this for my son for Christmas when he was two and a half. We set it up under the tree, with a stuffed Dalmatian to go along. My son was completely delighted. He'd been asking Santa for a firetruck for months! The spraying feature was a huge hit with him. The quality is fantastic - I was a little worried at first, since it's plastic, but after 7 months of play, it's held up perfectly. What great memories we've created from this toy. Thank you, Bruder.	1
As always Bruder makes great quality toys for kids.  very functional with its water spray-pump action and working sounds and lights.	1
Still playing with it. Loves it. Shares it with his younger cousins. It's put out many cardboard apartment complex fires. The toys are safe.	1
Brings back childhood memories! Love to play Chinese checkers & plan to teach grandchildren.	1
This brand is amazing. Crazy expensive- but now I know why. My 5 year old son was more than happy with this gift!	1
the perfect fire engine!  my son is absolutely obsessed with his.	1
Grandson loves it!	1
One of the best ones- My son and I shoot out candles from 20 feet with the firehose. This thing will really shoot the water far! Love the Bruder trucks.	1
Very well-built truck!	1
Nephew loves it	1
Great when you are teaching a little one new to peddling.  Also good for managing uphills and controlling downhills as well as pushing the trike when your less then 3 year old decided to get off and run the rest of the way to the playground! Just wish it was a little wider in the handle base so you could "steer" them more rather than just twisting it and your wrist slightly to nudge them back onto the sidewalk. Glad I spent the money on this... now can they make one for a big wheel style trike please! :)	1
I suppose if a bike had a bar attachment, this is what it would need to be like. However, don't expect life with a toddler on a bike to be any easier. You can't steer with this. I constantly find myself telling my son to turn his bike so we can get out of the middle of the street, because it is difficult to do with the bar.	1
Sturdy, self assembled push bar that really makes the Kettler tricycle, with its rear wheel steering, fun to push. Note that the plastic handle only goes on one way in order to orientate release button.	1
I bought this item thinking that the storage tin with the built-in playing board was a great feature. I ended up returning it for a refund because the holes aren't deep enough for the marbles to be properly seated, so any slight knock of the board causes all marbles to fall off of their divots.  In addition, the holes are so close together that adult hands must move very gingerly in order to avoid knocking a nearby marble out of its place when moving another.	-1
I may have actually reviewed this elsewhere on amazon and said something to the effect, "well, you buy it knowing it's going to be cheap, so I don't know why people are complaining."  If I said something like that, I've changed my mind.  I'm pretty open minded when it comes to quality of a product of this nature. It's pieces are GOING to be plastic, and chances are, cheap. But you really don't know how cheap they can be until you've seen this set. Basically, it looks like these pieces were all made to be magnetic... and then someone cut the budget, tore the magnets out, and still left the holes where the magnets should have gone. I kid you not.  Now, I was looking at it to begin with and thinking... "well... it'd do in a pinch" ... but that's called sunny optimism. Looking at them again, I'm not sure how anyone with grown-up hands could possibly play these games at all. The pieces are just too cheap. It's not what they look like, it's that they're so light and so badly made, that even if you didn't care if they looked like garbage (I didn't, really), they are pretty much un-usable.  I you're buying it for very, very careful and patient little kids, as a very, very cheap thrill... okay, maybe if they're SUPER patient, and their hands are very little, and they really ARE very careful... they MIGHT be able to actually play the games included. But probably not the rest of us. And the board I was silver and blue checkered. I've seen a lot of boards in my time, but this one really does look bad. They'd shaded the squares in a vain attempt to make it look cool or something, but it just looks really, really stupid. And the pieces are way, way too small for the chess board. And the marbles will just roll all over the place.  That being said, I'm not sure why anyone actually would want this set. Seriously, you'd be better off getting one of those standard black and red cheap sets they sell in stores with the plastic pieces. You won't get Chinese checkers, but you'll at least get TWO games (chess and checkers) that you actually CAN play. And I would have definitely been satisfied with that product for a "cheap game set".	-1
The board is very sturdy and marbles are nicely colored. The marbles do roll off the board when knocked so it does not work well for clumbsy fingers.	1
realistic toys top notch german quality	1
My son loves it!  The water hose is really cool!  Definitely well worth the money!	1
Really sturdy, endless fun.	1
just wish it was an American Truck other wise its an excellent toy	1
these were cute, the kids liked them	1
Love all the Bruder trucks, they are VERY well made.  Can't complain.	1
Nice truck	1
Works great with the go green trike. I love the handle because it totally saves my back as I push my daughter around on her trike. The 4 positions of the push bar is great too because I can use it (I am 5'4) and my husband can too (he is 6'5)	1
Not much to say here other than it delivers on its name.  My only other comment is that if you're ordering a tricycle along with this pushbar, make sure that you know if your tricycle already comes with a pushbar.  In any case, it comes in multiple pieces so you will need to assemble the handle and the tubular steel sections.	1
my kid love it	1
My grandson absolutely loves this fire truck. He is 3 and a half. He loves moving the ladder and pretending to put out fires. He likes using the hose although because he mostly plays with it in the house we didn't show him that you can actually put water in the little tank and actually spray it out through the hose yet. It seems pretty sturdy. He likes unwinding and winding up the hose. The siren and lights are great. He has a lot of fun with this. I think it was well worth the money. Its a very "solid" toy.	1
looks good quality and function	1
Very nice fire truck! Good size and has a lot of neat features.	1
This is a very popular toy at my house.  It has even managed to tear my 4-year-old away from the Playstation IV games he likes to play for an hour or two.  My 4-year-old and 2-year-old grandsons love cranking the ladder up and down and running their little people toys up and down, building towers with their MegaBloks and raising the ladder up to rescue people from the heights.  The younger one also likes to "wash" the fire truck with its hose.  I haven't yet disclosed to them that water can be put in the tank and actually squirted out through the hose.  I'm saving that for the right moment.  But they have discovered the flashing lights and the siren.  It's sturdy and a good size and the boys love it.  The only thing we don't like about it is that the driver and passenger doors on the cabs don't open.  I'm fairly certain that this toy will be remembered for a long time when they grow up.	1
My 3 year old grandson can play all day with this!  He loves it!	1
My son loves the Bruder toys and they hold up well.	1
Bruder toys are certainly built to last. Take a beating from a 2 yr old. He loves his fire truck!	1
A new favorite for a three year old. He'd sleep with it if he could. Pumps water much farther than expected so take it outside for that. Lights, siren, and stabilizers to hold it in place. Very accurate to real firetrucks and rugged.	1
Bruder toys rock.  Durable, realistic, functional.  My son loves them.	1
I ordered this fire truck on June 12 with my Prime account. Today is June 19! Don't know where this shipment is? Should have gotten it June 14. It just states it's in transit.	-1
I bought this as a gift.  While I do not know how it has held up, it looked great.  It was a great size, seemed very well made and the added features like the working hose were nice additions.  I researched other fire trucks and this one seemed to be the best size and quality.  It was a little pricey but seemed worth it based on quality.	1
this is a great product and it has held up under  use by a four year old. we do keep it out of the dirt and elements so it will last a long time	1
My son plays with the water feature all the time. When we received it, one of the lights did not work. Also the finish was not what I expected when compared to other Bruner trucks. Maybe it's time to redesign this.	1
I bought this for my 3 yr old grandson and he loves it. The hose really works well and squirts a long distance, so it is best to test it outside. Very realistic with lots of moving parts and durable construction.	1
Hands down! Bruder makes the best quality kids toys out there. The amount of detail and the precision workmanship is amazing. And they're very tough.	1
Very large truck.  It does a lot of things and was a gift also.  This will be a toy that lasts a long time.	1
This is a great truck, and like all Bruder products it is very realistic!  My son absolutely loves it, and I can see him playing with it for years to come.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because this is our first Bruder product, and I was surprised by how plastic it was.  I fully understood that it is made of plastic, but I guess I am just used to Fisher Price type toys that are made of really thick plastic, this reminds me of the plastic that a dollar store toy would be made of.  That is just me being nit picky though.  If you want a realistic, larger fire truck that your child will love you can't go wrong with this.	1
My sons have 6 or 7 Bruder trucks and they are great! They are big, well made and hold up to my 3 and 5 year olds' rough play. I just wish that the stabilizer attachments ( I think that's what those "legs" are that come off of the sides) were permanently attached, as I am always finding them lying around the house. This shouldn't be a problem with older, more RESPONSIBLE kids :)  Love that the fire hose actually squirts water,too. It certainly isn't the least expensive toy you could get a kid, but it's worth every penny. You absolutely get what you pay for!  I also recommend any of the Bruder garbage trucks, the dump truck and the crane truck!	1
This brand of truck is wonderful in my opinion. It has a wonderful amount of detail, working, extendable ladder, the engine lifts forward to show off the engine. We haven't tried the water pumping feature, but it seems great. My father has 3 other Bruder products, and this fire truck adds to our garbage truck at home for our 3 year old son. They get a wonderful amount of usage. There have been some issues with pieces breaking, but we moved this year, and the move was not kind. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another!  UPDATE: After a month and a half, the truck is still holding up well, especially considering how many parts there are. I will note that the hose nozzle comes off the hose easily, I'm sure there is a good reason for it, but i find that i'm chasing down a small grey nozzle at least once a week. The truck has taken a few tumbles from 2-3 feet and is holding up well, not that i'd suggest such abuse. The kids still love it, and i'm still very happy with my purchase!	1
LOVE these Bruder toys!  They are well made and have lots of interesting articulation in the ladder area.  The tires seem to be made of rubber rather than plastic which just adds to the realism for the kids!  The front cab even tilts forward.	1
This was cute idea but it does not stay bright for long. So we painted the wall blue to make them pop out anytime.	1
Awesome toys!  My five year old loves this brand.  They' re durable, lifelike and a lot of fun.  I highly recommend this brand!	1
you cannot beat the durability and functionality of BRUDER toys.  my sons love them (7 & 9).  the fact that these even spray water from the hose make them all too cool!	1
My 4 year old loves these! They are bright when they glow. These do not have adhesive on the backs, but it does come with a putty.	1
My son is has a thing for fire trucks so the moment I saw this he had to have it! Got it for him for Christmas and it's held up well with how rough he is on his toys. It makes sound and lights up and it's too annoying :) Lots of working parts but doors do not open. We lost the "spray nozzle" on the end of the hose (which I am sure will eventually turn up!) so be aware that is something you may want to superglue on before giving it to your child. Would definately recommend though!	1
The toy is really not too impressive. My son played with it for maybe a week and put it on the side. Not really something I would spend 50 dollars on and the hose is a joke.	-1
Too complicated for a 2 year old...but probably great for a 3 -4 year old due to the mechanical parts. I think the mother of the grandson kind of set it aside until he got older and didn't get frustrated by trying to raise the ladder without cranking it.	1
Santa got this one right!  My 5 year old loves it and plays with it every day. It's made with great quality. Although it has small parts that can break off if forced so I don't recommend for a child under 3 or 4.	1
Put these up on my 2-year-old sons ceiling the other day - they're perfect. The amount of sticky tack included was just enough, and he is amazed by them. Every night when he goes to bed he just stares at them and says wow, stars!	1
This truck was a hit.  Now more presents were opened until this was out of the box.  Great quality.  3 year old loves it.	1
Have been purchasing bruder products for my grandchildren.  They love them.  I cannot rate them since I have not seen them play with them.  They live out of town.	1
I bought this fire truck for my 3 year old son for Christmas 2013. He absolutely loves it and has been playing with it almost every day. Very durable and good quality. Downfall: the doors do not open and putting back the hose is a bit uncomfortable. Other than that we are very pleased with the purchase.	1
Does not shine like other glowing items that I purchased before. Also, the glue came in very little amount. I do not recommend it.	-1
Just initially opening the package, I regret my buy. There is only one large star and 1/3 of the box is filled with stars the size of my thumb nail. And the stars don't have any adhesive, instead you get a roll of double sided tape. I would return it if I hadn't destroyed the packaging. It will take me 10 years to put this on the ceiling.	-1
Didn't glow as long as expected.	-1
These do not stay lit up for very long. Also, the package is very heavy on the very tiny stars -- there were only 3 large stars in ours, and a handful of medium-large.	-1
They glow very brightly....for about 5 minutes. The stars fade much quicker than expected. Also, the amount of sticky tack included in the package is not enough for all of the stars. If you have a smooth ceiling, it may take less than I needed, but we have popcorn texture, and needed a good amount to get the larger stars to stay attached to the ceiling. All in all, these are not as nice as the ones I remember from my own childhood...perhaps just a bad brand.	-1
I wish there was an option for NO STAR rating. My son REALLY wanted glow in the dark stars. When we first got these, we made sure the stars got exposed to enough light. we left them by the window sill all afternoon. We then applied them to the ceiling (took about 1 hour to set them all up). Nighttime came and we turned off the lights. Wow!! They were really beautiful!! Yeah, the whole 10 minutes we spent conversing about his day at school, and what are weekend plans were to be.... as each minute passed the glow of the stars were getting dimmer and dimmer. 10 whole minutes is all it took for it to go from a beautiful sight, to, "what just happened"? NOT HAPPY!!! I could return them... but that would mean getting back up there and taking these back down. I have already thrown out the box that these came in. I am stuck with stars THAT DO NOT GLOW IN THE DARK FOR MORE THAN 10 minutes! Oh, his room gets PLENTY of bright sunlight so it's not like the stars weren't "charged". I am out on $10... I guess I can spend another $50 and get a black light.... maybe then these will hold the glow effect.  >=(	-1
Don't stick.	-1
They only supply enough tacky for 1/4 of the stars. So disappointed.	-1
I wish I would have just bought a star projector like I initially planned because these are pretty much crap.  I painstakingly applied these one by one on my sons bedroom ceiling which took forever.  He was so excited.  We kept the windows open to let in the sunlight, left the room light on much longer than usual, especially in the hours before bedtime.  They glowed great as I was putting him to bed.  Went back in less than 10 mins later and you could barely see them.  Don't waste your money.	-1
Not enough of that sticky shillap stuff. And it lights up for all of like five mins then can't see it so then my one year old doesn't even know they are on her ceiling. Doesn't get enough to look up and admire them when they are lit before they fade out.	-1
Very little sticky app included. They're starting to fall off already.	-1
Great stars but not enough putty in the package to complete the project. Very disappointing for both kid and adult.	-1
These do NOT work! They glow for like 5min!!! What a waste of money!!!	-1
The glow lasts less than 10 minutes. My son was disappointed.	-1
Stars only hold glow for a maximum of 5 minutes even when light is left on for hours to charge them. Don't waste your money here, look for another brand.	-1
They don't hold a glow very long, even charged for hours under UV lights.  If you have UV lights, they do have a nice effect when used in combination.	-1
Doesn't glow for a long time.  Maybe 2-3 minutes maximum.  Disappointed.	-1
Took forever to place the putty on the stars and put them up but the kids were so excited to help. Then we got towards the end and realized we did not have enough putty left. We had to start removing the stars and taking half of each putty backing from them to put towards the leftover stars. After all that work and letting the starts soak in the sunshine through 2 sunny windows in that small bedroom, after lights went out, they only glowed for a a few minutes. So I shined a flashlight on them one by one hoping to get more time out of them, and they'd glow, but just a few more seconds. Very disappointed that all that work went into it and I made sure they got a whole day of sunshine on them. Plus, there should have been more putty provided.	-1
These do not glow very long AT ALL!  If you only want stars that glow for a few minutes, these will work for you.  If you want them to last a little longer, these are NOT what you want to buy.	-1
I went through all the product reviews and it was said that these were the best stars and stayed bright for the longest time. Well, they do stick to the ceiling very well but after exposure to light, they only glow for 15 mins at the most.	-1
Although these seemed to be good quality and look cool while they glow.. They should glow for more than 15-20 minutes max which is the longest ours will glow. Of course we didn't realize this till we had pretty much all of them up already.  Needless to say we are disappointed.	-1
VERY disappointed in this. I guess I didn't read enough about the product. I wanted to write on all of the stars, but half of them are smaller than a dime!! This was not worth the money I spent and I wish I would have returned it, but didn't have the time to order another set for what we needed it for.	-1
Not sure what we're doing wrong, but these darn things won't even glow. We've tried a multitude of different things, but if we're lucky, they'll glow for a good few minutes and then go out. So my suggestion would be to put them in rooms with a lot of natural light. Despite our two windows, it's apparently not enough.	-1
I bought this for my son's room, paid $10 and the stupid things don't even glow!! I can't exactly return them because I now have them stuck to my son's wall. So now I have a ton of stars on his wall that don't do a damn thing! What a waste, he was super excited he even helped with putting them up. So if someone reads this and can explain why they aren't glowing that'd be great!	-1
didn't stick, had to superglue it...	-1
I love the idea of these but they just don't glow long enough. I turn on the light in my son's room while we're brushing his teeth and then leave the light on while we do "story time". That adds up to about 20-30 minutes of "charging" time for the stars. After I turn out the light, the stars glow fantastically but that only lasts for a few minutes and after 5-10 minutes, you can barely tell they're there. I wasn't expecting them to glow all night but I expected at least a 1:1 ratio for glow time.	-1
These are pretty crappy. I put them in my sons room and we were all excited for bed time so he could check them out. They don't even glow unless you shine a light directly in front of them, and they then fade out within 2-3 minutes. What a waste of my time putting all of these things up, not to mention a waste of my money.	-1
My 4 year old isn't disappointed, but I am. The stars are easy to hang and there are plenty to fill a bedroom ceiling. There is plenty of sticky stuff included, as the stars each take very little. However, the stars usually glow for 5-20 minutes. We've tried leaving all of his bedroom windows open and his ceiling light on all day - it didn't help.	-1
My 14 year old had these on her ceiling when she was little. I got them for our youngest who is now 3. These glow for 5 minutes at most. No where near enough adhesive (which was the case 10 years ago too). The glowing is not at all impressive. Nothing like I remembered this product by same company ten years ago.	-1
This really doesn't work very well, would not buy it again.	-1
Cheaply made	-1
too cheap. came in pink when I bought it for my boy.  Can't pick the color.	-1
I bought these for my son who's scared of the dark.  I had the light on and also opened the blinds so the stars would shine all night.  These stars do not glow.  Very disappointing.	-1
Came opened and damaged. Returned	-1
Aren't these supposed to glow? They lose their brightness almost immediately after we turn off the lights.  We have to keep "charging" them with a flash light.  My 4 year old keeps getting out of bed because they aren't glowing.  Really frustrating.  On another note, I gave rated this 2 stars because they are working as a good behavior reward system.  Got the idea from another reviewer.  He earns stars during the day and then we put them up on the ceiling at bedtime.  There is a good variety of sizes.  Just wish they were brighter.	-1
cheap cheap cheap..... need I say more?	-1
Broke instantly.	-1
Not as good as the one I had as a youngster. Good price but it doesn't echo as well. Seems really big and probably won't work well with tiny hands. Did not say Magic Mike on it. It was called "Echo Mic". I wish I had not ordered it.	-1
I was so excited to put these on my son's ceiling but you have to individually put the sticky stuff on each star (and some of them are tiny!).  Half of them fell off after six months.	-1
Super super cheap! My 20 month old broke the top off it literally 5 seconds after I gave it to her! Thankfully I can pop it back on but it is a pain.  I do have to say she enjoys it though.  I thought there would be more of an echo.	-1
We have a son and took our chances on ordering, but got pink.  Recommend getting this at the store if you need a specific color.	-1
I leave the lights on all day, literally 14 hours straight, plus sunlight from outside. I turn the light out just before I put my kids to bed, they do glow bright momentarily but by the time I bring the kids into the nursery 5 MINUTES later, you can't see them AT ALL! My 4-year-old asks "Where are the stars?" and squints at the wall yeah, it's that bad!  Save your money!	-1
I was looking for a mic for my 3 year old. This does not have an off/on switch.  It has a fake button.  It is not a real mic. It just allows the child to hear their echo. And they will have to put their mouth practically on top of the mic.  Maybe a fun toy for a 1 year old.  Would not recommend for older toddlers.  Go to Lakeshore Learning for a better mic.	-1
As others already mentioned, they only glow for a couple of minutes....  what a disappointment!	-1
We only got a few big / medium sized stars, the rest were tiny. Thankfully we only needed a few for a small size room, but if you have a large room you may want to find a different kind.	-1
There isn't enough of the sticky stuff to use on all the stars. They don't seem to glow for very long.	-1
this is going to get trashed in a hurry	-1
I got these to hopefully help the kiddos sleep at night as kind of something to stare at and fall asleep. Well - they don't glow very well ... if at all. If we shine a flashlight on them for quite a while they'll glow for maybe 5 minutes. Yeah - I bought two packs of these and am pretty disappointed. Oh Well!	-1
They glow for a few minutes at best.  My boys were excited, but ended up being disappointed.  I wouldn't recommend.	-1
I couldn't believe it, it didn't even glow. I held it up to the light and it would glow for five minutes then it was out. What a waste, got my refund but was dissapointed because my kids were looking forward to them.	-1
I read the reviews and they were great! Now that I have them, I am so very disappointed! They don't glow very long and they keep falling off the ceiling. I will usually have a lamp on and read to my son for about 10mins. This is after turning off his bedroom light. The stars lose their glow after 10mins and still have the lamp on. Don't waste your money!	-1
On the first day the wire riped the tent my daughters got hurt and by the second day we had to throw the tent away now we only have the worm. I was not satisfied with this product.	-1
Since the support sleeves in the corners do not reach all the way down to the ends of the stakes, it was a breeze for my daughter to jump into the tent upon putting it together, and literally break it after it had been out of the box for less than 5 minutes.  We're going to have to splint that tent pole to salvage this thing.  Additionally, the pockets in the corner for the stakes are very shallow, and we're constantly having to put the corners back into them to keep this thing from folding up.  Oh, and the tunnel won't stay in unless you use the end of the tunnel with the ties on it to tie it into the tent hole, but once you've done that, you've moved the velcro piece that attaches the ladybug face into the inside of the tent, so you can't use the ladybug face unless you sew/glue a piece of velcro to the other end of the tube.  It's pretty much a very cute piece of junk.  Super flimsy.  Oh, and PPS the top of the tent has these lame little ties that are supposed to keep the 2 stakes in place.  They don't. If I had it to do again, I'd try the other brand, which looks as though it provides far better support for the stakes.	-1
There is not enough adhesive to go around for even a quarter of the amount of stars. I had to use my own adhesive	-1
My boys actually never played with these, even to use as building blocks. They are well crafted, and neatly designed, but they are very heavy with sharp pointy ends on the square pieces. Perhaps they would be good in a classroom "store"  role play setting, or I have seen museums that have grocery stores and kitchems set up for kids to role play in.	-1
Regretfully it is too plasticky. I am still keeping it, but I am replacing the bottom sheet with a fabric sheet and placing netting in the windows and cutting out three more star windows in the back with netting in them. Even before I bought it I thought I might have to do these changes. My granddaughter plans to sleep in here... I'd be nuts to let her sleep in a plastic bag.	-1
Small	-1
Small for the price.	-1
First make sure you understand that the blue sheet you see in the photo is NOT part of the tent.  The tent sits AROUND the bed so you use your child's normal sheets.  It has strips of material in the corners to keep the tent on top of the bed; they aren't perfect, but they work. And children can still fall out of this tent, it's not really secured to the bed.  However, because I researched this product I knew this in advance so that's not the reason for the 2 stars.  I can't give it 5 stars because it is WAY over-priced and poorly (misleadingly) advertised.  I can buy a full size/outdoor/water proof tent for 3 people that includes a floor, rain-fly, zipper enclosures and tent stakes for about the same discounted price (WAY less than the $86 retail price of this tent on the mfg site) and the material would be about the same quality.  So the markup on this product has got to be high.  However, I found no other company selling full sized bed tents so I really didn't have much of a choice!  ..which is probably WHY it's so expensive.  It went up quick and it is decently constructed but the opening is Velcro NOT zippered as listed.  The mfg doesn't mention either way but the photo is the same which does NOT match the actual product.  The door doesn't open the full length of the bed either as pictured by other people and ads I've seen.  Maybe the twin still has the full opening and a zipper or maybe it was a recent change and the ads haven't caught up, or maybe I got an old model tent?!  Who knows, but there is definitely misleading packaging here and poor descriptions all over so I have to ding them a few stars.  It appears to me that the photo used on the double product is the SAME as the twin product (and looks like the twin model).  And one last note..with an opening that does not go end to end like shown in the photo, the Velcro straps that are there to hold the door flaps open are totally USELESS.  Thankfully I had some adhesive backed Velcro on hand I could stick to it so the doors now stay open.  Bottom line..I would recommend another product if there were one, but given no other choice...If your kid likes tents as much as my daughter then go ahead and buy it. It's not a BAD tent...just a definite candidate for the phrase "Caveat emptor".  I will also note I bought mine through Walmart because it was cheaper.  So if anybody orders the one shown here at Amazon AFTER 5/2013 please comment as to whether our not yours has zippers and opens the whole way because quite frankly that was my main factor in dinging it below 4 stars.  The last star is the price.	-1
I ordered one of these and got the right colors. I ordered another one and received a GREY Cat in the Hat.  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!	-1
Junk, no echo unless you yell on top of your lungs in it.	-1
This echo mic really doesn't have that much of an echo to it. We bought this one and a cheaper one at the same time and the cheaper one, while it doesn't look as nice, it's actually better than this one. We ended up giving this one away to a friend.	-1
Doesn't have much of an echo like the other's I've played with.	-1
Doesn't  work  as well as I  remembered them to work as a kid. My 2 year old wasn't impressed.	-1
This is just a place form. It does not amplify voice in any way. Very disappointed. The same item is at the dollar stores everywhere.	-1
We bought this and 2 months later the thing busted - that is no fun.	-1
My kids (1.5 years and 4 years) asked for this. I thought it would do a bit more to make their voices echo, but there is no real difference.	-1
I thought when it said I was saving 40 dollars it would be of good quality it was only worth a dollar. does not do anything I suppose you get what you paid for	-1
When I received it, it was not packaged well so it was smashed. It was an inexpensive item, so not a big loss. Still not as I expected. You will get what you pay for. It works even though I was unable to put it back into its original condition.	-1
cheap plastic.  You might as well take and paint a toilet paper roll, it would achieve the same end goal.	-1
I knew what to expect when buying this thing, because I had one when I was younger.  It's not a microphone but more of an echo chamber.  It can be fun to play with for a minute or two at a time.  Mine was broken, though, when I received it and it was not worth the effort to return it, so I would suggest not buying this online but rather in a store - you also get to pick the color you want that way.	-1
Pretty much nothing. Very little echo quality. Would not recommend. Tem more words required.six, five, four, three, two, one. none.	-1
Vendor does not let  you pick the color and I ended up receiving a pink and purple mic for my son.	-1
In order to get any echo whatsoever you have to really yell into this and then you can't hear it anyways because you have to yell so loud. I got it as a fun Xmas gift for my 17 month old. No wires, no batteries. Thought he would love it. It's pretty much a piece of crapola. Already at the bottom on the toy chest!	-1
I was very much disappointed, as it was very cheaply made.  I ended up buying a different one to replace it!	-1
I am so disappointed in this microphone. You can't even choose your color. They sent me purple for my little boy. It barely echoes. Not entertaining at all. Don't waste your money.	-1
The mike is a lot bigger than I expected & I don't hear much of an echo.  My daughter doesn't care for this toy.	-1
After 3 days of use. These are not the well made yo yo strings that were available to us when we were younger. The yo yo strings we had didn't fray. They were a tightly twisted twine/string that were treated with something that made them not fray. The strings back then were sturdy and lasted for years. This company knows they are using the cheapest unreliable string for a yo yo. My son had a lot of fun with this yo yo until it broke on the third day.  I will be looking for a yo yo with the string that a yo yo actually needs to be reliable and durable.	-1
Ehh. It hurts.	-1
Would be great for learning, but the one I got my son had a clutch that wouldn't release no matter how hard he threw. I could get it to sleep very briefly if I threw it very hard, but this yo-yo is useless. If there was a way to adjust the clutch tension if could be fixed, but everything is glued together. Good luck getting a well adjusted one.	-1
Very disappointed this is just a tiny thing. I don't know how they got 6".	-1
Overall, I am very disappointed in this purchase. It is much smaller than I anticipated and not the best quality. The bead maze on top is very flimsy and some of the wires touch so the beads cannot move freely.  I wish I would have gone with another brand and would not recommend.	-1
Cheap	-1
Save your money and move on. All the rave reviews about how it's Made in America and how it's a quality toy that will last for years no longer applies to the current productions over at Anatex. There is obviously very poor quality control at Anatex now. I have umpteen amouts of other Made in China children's items that are produced in far better in quality than the Anatex Play Cube. All my photos are right out of the box. I don't have an exceptionally high expectation of things. However, this was by all means extremely sloppily made. The quality of the kind of work into making this toyis something you'd expect from the visually impaired, I-am-drunk-on-the-job-I-hate, minimum wage type of work. Chipped wood pieces abound, paints on surfaces they shouldn't be and poorly applied to where they should. Rough wood edges everywhere, there isn't a piece that isn't crooked, scrapped areas and peeling finishes... Did I get one made from throw away leftover parts? At it stands, I feel like a sucker having forked over actual money for this. The only saving grace here is that my child has expressed a great deal of interest in it. However, I'm conflicted because I'm hesitant to let my kid play with it without acute supervision. I just don't trust that this thing isn't a hazard in some way or another. Furthermore, I am confused by all the chocking hazard warning, everything is supposedly attached to the cube.. right?	-1
Paid to much. Sharp corners.	-1
Junk!  Mustache was sewed under, uneven and poorly made.  I wouldn't give this to a child.  I returned mine.  Save your money.	-1
My son received this stuffed Horton for Christmas.  The picture on Amazon makes it look like this is made of a very soft material, however it is not.  I was very disappointed with how different this toy was from the picture.  Contemplated returning to Amazon, just wasn't worth the hassel.  Would definitely suggest looking elsewhere for a Horton toy.	-1
The alphabet blocks have VERY sharp corners.  My little girl cut the top of her finger open the very first time she touched this cube.  The heading above the alphabet blocks is cockeyed, doesn't effect function at all, but looks bad (and makes me think poor craftsmanship).  I had to partially disassemble the cube to get it to set-up.  I could not have screwed the top down without unscrewing the sides.	-1
Skin peels right off	-1
I ordered this for my 18 month and 3 year old daughters. I get that the title says mini but I was really surprised how small it was. The top didn't sit on the box properly and the peg maze didn't move fluidly at all. It was like it was made by child labor in a third world country and passed off as a nice educational toy. I returned it the day it arrived. Really, this thing is almost a joke. I truly can't understand how anyone could give this a good review. It's just terrible.	-1
I love the design of this toy and so does my son. BUT, I sent the first one back because one of the crews was stripped and kept turning. I sure didn't want it to fall out one one and my son finding it. It had some paint marks on the inside and piece of wood on the inside was broken. Then, I got a replacement one that has one screw stripped once again and the 4 screws to screw the top were missing altogether and of course more paint on the inside. Made in China with lots of paint which also makes me nervous. Their quality control sucks, I can't believe that two out of two products are both defective. I feel bad for Amazon paying for shipping back and forth to send me new and will keep the second one, but will NOT purchase any more products from Anatex. This toy cost around $100 and for this kind of money, I expect quality. And this product is not quality.	-1
My child loves horses and I suggested that her grandparents get her this set because it was a Melissa and Doug set and I love their toys. Boy were we hugely disappointed. I should of read reviews because I would have looked elsewhere. These are hollow plastic shells with a fuzzy coat, I expected them to be solid. My child loves the hair and fur but one good scrape and the fuzz is coming off. Several reviews state that legs have broken and I can see how that could happen but my 3 year old is taking good care of them even while playing with them so we haven't suffered that fate (yet... but I hope we don't ever) . Getting them out of the box was a pain as they are glued in there (we didn't lose anything like other have) but the storage box was nice. Now my real gripe comes in the fact that these are suppose to look realistic (hence the breed description on the back) but both of the quarter horses have hot bright pink instead of the ornage brown on their noses and legs. They still play fine and I wouldn't return them for that, but if you bought these for realistic appearance be warned that theres a chance you will get the hot pink instead of the orange.  So would I buy these again? No. Do I hate them? Not really, they are cheap but still function ok. Does my child love them? EXTREMELY!	-1
Not what I expected..too small n their fuzzy n cheap	-1
Not the greatest for my horse lover.  The scenery behind the horses is just "set" in there - not paint on or attached to "stable" so we threw those away right away.  I thought she would love these - but she never plays with them.  I'll try another set of horses to see if she likes them better.	-1
These feel cheap and while I understand that they are not expensive for each pony I did not expect them to be int he condition they were. the tails must have been inserted into the rear end after cutting a hole because a few of them had large gashes in the rear end from where the tail was put in. Also all of the horses that look like they are supposed to have white hooves/noses with a bit of brown airbrushed look at the tips ended up bright pink! My daughter loves them but they are disappointing in quality. Maybe dollar store quality for each one.	-1
These are really junky. Not really even interesting to play with longer than 20 minutes out of the packaging.	-1
I wasn't happy with the quality when I received them. I thought they would make a nice gift but they seemed very cheap. I ended up not feeling comfortable enough to present them as a gift and got something else instead.	-1
If your looking for cheap and unrealistic this is the toy for you.  These flocked horses are not what a horse lover would want.	-1
My 3 year old daughter really has enjoyed this set of horses but maybe a little too much. Unfortunatley they are not super sturdy and the legs have been easily ripped off and hair pulled out. We ended up getting a set od sturdy, simple plastic ones and they have fared much better.	-1
Do not waste your money on this one -- too many other nicer horse options out there.  The horses are cheap fuzzy creatures.  More effort by the manufacturer was put into the wood container that holds the horses but it is not a fun way to play with the horses anyway.  My daughter put all the horses in a barn yard house she has and never looked at them again!	-1
This item is not a push broom as advertised. There is no angle to the head at all. The Schylling Push Broom is excellent. It is very easy to use and my little one loves it. Amazon has it starting at $8.99.	-1
I ordered this for my 3 year old grandson, and it is going back. It is not angled at all so therefore no different than a regular broom.	-1
We were not using them for anything other than pulling weeds and there is already a hole in the leather tip????  Not meant for real work?  but are sure cute	-1
Sadly the drill power button broke very quickly, retuned for money back, sorry, it was an interesting tool kit the grandson really like. Just not durable for him to play with.	-1
I really liked this set but the sound for the shapes is messed up. it calls the circle a square and the square a circle.	-1
We received this as a birthday gift. The drill was defective. It was assembled with a wire caught between two of the pieces, thus breaking it. We contacted the company and Amazon. Neither responded. Otherwise, this is such a cute set. But with the only electronic tool not working, I can't give this product more than one star.	-1
Not worth the money. My son lost interest right away.	-1
We got this for my sister along with the leapster. She loves Dora so we just HAD to get this. My sister's 6 and maybe she's growing out of Dora because she tired of this game very quickly and so did I. It was too repetitive and not quite as intersting as the Sonic game we also got. So in comparison, Dora was "borrr-ing" as my sister said when she switched to play another game.  So even if you child loves Dora, don't buy this game unless your child is under the age of 6. I think even the game was made special for kids still learning about up and down and counting and not for kids in school. It really itsn't worth it, and not very exciting. Remember to follow the age suggestions when in doubt, that helps. My sister was past the Dora game educational speaking, even if she still loved the character Dora.	-1
the drill does not move.  needless to say we returned it and purchased one by Fisher Price.  We were satisfied with Amazon's return policy :]	-1
We just opened this, and after playing it once, the timer is already broken.  It won't set & the game just keeps popping up.  Even though surely they aren't all so easily broken, it's still really poorly made.  It seems more like a dollar store toy than the $8 I paid.  My kid likes using it to put the shapes in, regardless.	-1
This smaller version is cheaply made...the tray that pops doesn't work properly and it doesn't always "pop" when the time is up.  In the side of the game there is a slide out drawer that holds the pieces when not being used.  I got all of the 16 pieces in after a lot of jiggling and positioning, then when we tried to open the tray up, it was jammed.  My husband had to unscrew the body of the game in order to open up the drawer.  The game pieces are very small and it takes a lot of thumb/index finger coordination to insert them into the tray of the game.  Overall, not worth the money.	-1
The timer does not work on this. Gave it as a gift for Christmas. The pop up on it occasionally works if pushing the timing button that doesn['t move otherwise. Was extremely disappointed. Use to love this game as a child!	-1
We won't be using this as intended. My husband & I can't even get the puzzle completed before the timer goes off. Our 6 year old got very frustrated with it. It needs to give much more time. And honestly, I get why it's noisy, but it could be just a touch quieter. I'm still using it with my 2 year old, just without the timer. Also the storage drawer (for the pieces) is too small.	-1
Box arrived destroyed and damaged. Not presentable for a gift now.	-1
It broke after a few uses.  I mentioned this in mixed company and another person had the same problem.	-1
came with the timer broken	-1
Very very very small Didn't pop out the Peices Like it should timer kept getting stuck but they found a way to enjoy it and its not for 4 yr and under	-1
Its a game made to be very very quick. I wouldn't mind if it would give some more time to put in the pieces. It only gives you 10 seconds. My 5 yr old cant do this so quick.	-1
The timer is too fast and the pieces too small. I remember having this game as a child and it was a much larger version. We bought this for our children and WE cannot even complete the puzzle before the timer runs out, let alone our kids. It's not even any fun and it ended up going in the trash. What a waste!	-1
the button for the timer doesn't always work with this game, and the pieces are small enough that they can get lost very easily.	-1
I bought two as a gift and both of them did not work proparly. The time didn't work and it would pop up.	-1
16 pieces, and only 30 seconds.  Unless you are some sort of shape-sorting and placing savant, this game will just frustrate you.  I bought it for my 5yr twins, but what's the point of playing with a toy that virtually guarantees failure?  Spend your money on the Perplexus Maze, instead.  Much, much more fun!	-1
I bought this at a local drug store on sale for less than five dollars and still think I was ripped off.  The games says it is for 5+ years but the times maxes out at just over 10 seconds.  No way my 5-year old can come close to putting 16 shapes in the holes in 10 seconds or less.  The "storage" tray does not really fit all the pieces - I can make it work but two other adults tried and gave up.  It feels cheap and is just disappointing.	-1
My children (6,5 and 2) recieved this as a present.  I was excited to share the game with them, as I loved this game when I was little.  I don't know if it's just my lack of dexterity and speed, but 10 seconds does not seem long enough to randomly put these pieces in - and I'm talking about myself - not my children.  My husband had a test 'go' to see if he could do it.  Before he started the timer, he arranged all the pieces in the correct order on the table.  Then he started the timer and worked as fast as he could.  He lost.  Now, that's not to say that NOONE could do it, but for young children, it seems odd that a game would give them little to no chance of ever beating it.  I also have to say (just as the other reviews mention) the game does pop up randomly and does not get set very easily.  The quality is less than satisfactory.  Overall opinion?  I think this small version is going to be useful when the children just want to sit down and put the shapes in, but as a game with actual competition it's not going to do the job.  Therefore, I rate it 1 star and I think I will go out and find an original, big-size Perfection.	-1
If you expect this model to match the pictures of it in Star Trek Communicator Magazine you will be very disappointed.  If you compare the two you will see that the one in the magazine was obviously touched up with more detail.  What you actually g et is decent but it's not like the one in the magazines.  It does however match the picture that Amazon provides pretty well.  It is best viewed from a distance,, I'll put it that way.  There is a visible seam where the struts of the nacelles attach to the main engineering hull in particular.  If you attach the base AFTER the base mounting hull plate is attached as they say to do you risk damaging the model. Best to attach the base to the mounting plate first then screw it on.  Sounds are cute..  Mainly it just isn't nearly as finished as I would have hoped.	-1
As I was opening the package, one of the buildings fell on the table and broke.  It's too small to really work with.	-1
Tiny item. Would have returned if it was worth th bother	-1
Very small. Toy	-1
MINI is the key word here. This thing is tiny. Cute for the corner of my desk. But not what I was hoping for.	-1
If I remember correctly, the original Pinky actually bounced high and didn't weigh like a rock.	-1
I was very pleased with my purchase of the hot wheels 1/8 scale batmobile I can wait to get the other 1/8 scale batmobiles!	-1
I guess they'd make a nice pricey party favor, but they definitely do not work if you're using them for the Melt Method.  They're much too hard.  They bounce well, but it's not what I was hoping for it to be.	-1
Ball dried out quickly and began to crumble. I will not purchase this brand again. Lasted about 2 weeks before this began.	-1
For a "hi-bounce" ball I was disappointed; ours was kind of a dud.  Wouldn't buy it again.  Go for the traditional superball instead.	-1
Very dissappointed in this ball... I thought it would bounc a lot higher than it does.  I am glad i only bought one... was going to buy a pack of six for my daughter.  You deffinitely need adult force to get this ball to bounce, and the material seems that it would come apart if chewed on.  Lame Bounce Pinky.	-1
cheap. do not recommend to purchase.	-1
It was great the first week but after that it would not play anymore - I think there was a problem with the cord - if you moved it around the picture would go in and out but we never were able to get it playing again - a real disappointment for my son who loves pac-man	-1
The graphics for dig dug are awful.  It's a cheap imitation.  I don't know what they did to make this but it's definitely NOT the arcade version which btw I just had one of which I fixed for afriend of mine so I know how it should look.  This thing is a cruel joke.	-1
My grandchild hardly touches it except to use for a stool. Pieces are way to small. Choking hazard for little ones	-1
I really like other products by this company (the rainbow color cones are awesome), but these were poorly made. They were hard to pull apart and put together, but most importantly, the little plastic injection molding nibs had not been cut off and there were sharp parts that could scratch little hands.	-1
This cupcake set smells awful; Whether it's PVC/vinyl or other kinds of awful chemicals, I actually became nauseous after opening these from the horrendous smell. They are extremely difficult to put together/take apart, and both of my daughters (and myself) are frustrated by this. I've been looking forward to this set becoming a part of our play kitchen, and now I'm a bit afraid to let my daughters play with this due to the awful smell (yes, I washed the pieces as instructed--they still smell). I would return this set, but it's too much of a hassle with amazon. 2 thumbs down :-(	-1
The plastic is very cheap and hollow. The tiles are nothing like the original game.	-1
Junkiest toy ever.  This MIGHT be worth $2.  The game is fun, but each piece is tiny, thinly form plastic.	-1
Its ok. Very cute looking. It is not for little kids because it is so thin and you have to have really good balance to stay on it. When my kids were able to do this properly they were too tall.	-1
My dad and I gave this game a try on Christmas. He and I normally love games, and even like nerdy math and strategy games that some people don't care for as much. I enjoy regular dominoes, so I thought this would be fun. Sadly, it is a boring game with very little room for strategy or surprises. The numbers are 0-5, and there are 50 or 60 tiles in the game. Each player takes a few tiles and takes turns placing them. Points are scored for numbers shown on placed tile, with bonuses for finishing a hexagon or creating a bridge. If you can't play, you draw tiles until you can, deducting 5 points for each. Scoring is cumbersome, and the game is slow and unexciting. Stick with regular dominoes for a much better game.	-1
If I could give this product zero stars, I would. One literally needs an engineering degree to put it together. My nephew begged for me to get this for him after he rode one at school. I tried for three hours to put this nightmare of a toy together and I couldn't do it. Nor could three other adults. Maybe we got a defective one, but nonetheless had to return it. Replaced this Motorcycle with the Paw Patrol Ryder ride on toy. It's already assembled in the box. All you have to do is easily pop on the handlebars. Do NOT waste your money or time on this Step2 Motorcycle. Until Step2 packages this so that it's already assembled when it comes to you, it's an absolute waste!	-1
My sons teacher has a cookie jar that looked JUST like this one, except it counted each cookie out load as you put it in the jar. Since this cookie jar is identical to the one his teacher has I bought it thinking it was the same one. But no, this is just a cookie jar with cookies in it, no electronic counting. We were very disappointed when we opened it and realized it was not what we expected.	-1
Not recommended. We got this for $13 around Black Friday time. It was a pain to put together and the black handles wouldn't slide over the plastic pipe for the handles properly - we never got them on so they were always partly off - not sure how to push them on further it was so tight. The main reason I do not like or recommend this motorcycle is that there is no steering option so your toddler gets on and can only go straight ahead unless they are older and then have to pick the whole thing up to turn it if they are able.  Other ride on's with steering were by far the preference for my car crazy toddler.  I would give this a miss.	-1
My son is two years old and can already count to 10, but I thought he would have fun putting cookies in the jar and having it make noise. This toy makes no noise at all, its simply a cheap plastic jar and ten cheap plastic cookies. The cookies are so flimsy that you can bend them in half. For nearly $20 I feel this toy is a rip off. Save yourself the $20 and draw your child out 10 "cookies" made out of paper and turn a coffee can into a "cookie jar"- it will have just as much educational value and will likely last as long.	-1
It was supposed to arrive Friday (8/28) but as of today, it's just now in Tennessee.  If it ever arrives, I'm sure my 2 year old nephew will enjoy it (his birthday party was this past Saturday).	-1
Pretty disappointing. Quite difficult to put together and then the toy won't even Stand up on its own!	-1
My son loves this but it's extremely light so he keeps tipping over with it still in his hands...	-1
I'm disappointed in this.  The tools are cute enough, but theres basically nothing for the child to do with them.  I bought this for my three year old great grand son for his birthday.  My advice is save your money.	-1
I will admit that all in all, my 4 year old really enjoys using this toy. However, that said, it is important to note it's (rather large) shortcomings.  The tool belt will NOT stay on. My little guy is not overweight, but the tool belt has fallen off so frequently that he won't even wear it anymore. This is the whole reason this set was bought, as he LOVES tool belts.  The drill was broken almost as soon as we got it out of the (very nice hard plastic) case. The bit won't spin, but the motor makes a sound as if it should be spinning. It's like something is broken on the inside.  My little guy has more amusement in carrying around the plastic case this all arrived in - and not the tool case, but the weak plastic pieces it's held together in that you would normally throw away - than wearing the tool belt. Pass this one up and get some wooden tools, they hold up much better. I thought this was a deal, unfortunately I was wrong.	-1
My 2 1/2 year old LOVES motorcycles and we thought he would love riding on this in the yard/sidewalk.  He refused to even sit on it.  We left it in the yard for several months, hoping he would take a liking to it, but he never did.  Even after us trying to help him.  Older cousins not interested either.  Sold it at our garage sale.	-1
Bad quality	-1
The front wheel does not turn.  This is completely useless. It might look good in picture. However, it is a very disappointing product.  I think it should not be on the market.	-1
not well made and very fragile and sold at other stores for 1/2 the price once i looked further	-1
So i bought this for my neice who was turning 3. For one thing when i received this toy it was incredibly hard to put together. Actually let me correct that the tires were hard to put together. It looked incredibly small also. The age range for it said 2-4 so she was 3 i thought perfect. When she sat on it she looked like a big kid on a little kids toy. It didn't make noise, it actually didn't do anything and she ended up bending it by standing on it cause its made of plastic. Now there is this HUGE white crease in the middle of the bike from where it bent.	-1
Don't waste your money on this toy.  I have two 3yr olds that I brought this toy for.  They could not ride it with out it falling over.  The toy is two narrow and the wheels are not big enough to hold it up with a 3 yr old toddler on it.	-1
The front shovel broke off with normal use. I expect Bruder to be much stronger.	-1
Broke right away. Not built for the price I payed. The plastic is cheap. My son was disapointed that his toy broke so quickly.	-1
Sad to say, but when I recieved this product the box was all torn and pieces to the backhoe were already falling off as I opened the box it was packaged in, so returned the next day.  Was so disappointed I. The quality of this product.  When comparing toys by fisher price and little tikes...i will have to admit that I would not buy trucks from Bruder after seeing the lack of quality.	-1
When you look at the design, you will see the center is more "cut out" than the rest. While this is necessary to allow for different sounds, this center piece of wood needs to be thicker. My 2 yr old Grandson broke that piece after playing with it for about an hour or so. {It was broken by being hit with the drumstick} The toy had to be thrown out. there was no repairing it as the break was sharp and dangerous.   While it does help the child create many different sound & again, all that is needed is to make that one piece of wood thicker. It is a good toy for musical education otherwise. But the "Otherwise" is a biggie! I'll be writing to the manufacturer about this as well.	-1
I absolutely loved this drum but it was for a 2-year-old who wants 2 drum sticks, so I had to return it. Plan Toys, I love your products, but please consider how a toddler actually plays! The crappy plastic drum I got at Target makes my daughter happy, but I wish we could have kept this one instead.	-1
It isn't a drum. It looks like a drum, but makes not very musical sounds even when you hit it just right, and the baby can't do that. Plan toys makes great toys, but I'd stay away from their musical instruments. He never wants to play with this one.	-1
SO lound. And the drumstick came apart immediately--the glue didn't hold for more than a few drumbeats.	-1
The mallet broke within minutes of giving this to my son and he wasn't interested in the drum whatsoever. Next time I would search for something better.	-1
My son loves anything to do with drums, but he really isn't into this toy. I think he'd like it better if it came with two drumsticks instead of only one. Also, I find it interesting that the drum is cut to make three different tones, but the choice of tones is off-putting.	-1
breaks easily	-1
you get what you pay for... cheap imitation of the original	-1
We opened this game to play and it seems cheap. We love the challenge of the game, but you may want to go with another brand.	-1
I would NOT buy this toy. If it was not a gift, I would return it. It is made so cheaply. There are barely enough sticks to keep the balls up. Once you put the game together, which I found hard to snap in to place, it will not fit back in to the box. So how are you going to store it with all the marbles and sticks without taking it apart? It's way too hard for a child to put back together. I am not usually so negative, but I have no idea how this product can stay on the market.	-1
I thought this would be fun for my two-year old as she, of course, loves ice cream but I never gave her a chance to check it out. The scoops of ice cream are a weird rubbery material and it felt really weird in my hand. Smelled funny to. Also, they were difficult to fit on top of the cones. So I returned it and we are using our imagination instead when we play ice cream shop and make our cones out of Bristle Blocks (which I highly recommend!!)	-1
The instructions are confusing!	-1
eh	-1
The box was a disaster. It came with the corners all taped together, the way you do at home when you've owned and used a puzzle so often and for so long that the box falls apart. I can't possibly give this as a gift like I'd planned, as it looks like I picked it up at a yard sale.	-1
Melissa and Doug toys and puzzles are manufactured in China.  That, to me, is enough to deter me from purchasing them.  I prefer the quality and beauty of Ravensburger puzzles.  They are just wonderful!	-1
Gizmo is really cute.  He looks just like in the movie!  I did notice he does have a fur issue near his left eye.  Ill have to hot glue it.  Hes small.  He fits in my hand.  Hes weighted a bit on his bottom.  My son will love him Im sure.  I hope his feet don't fall off like Ive read in other reviews.  They seem secure.  His ears, hands and feet are plastic.  Hes really cute though.  I hope he holds up to my 5 year olds rough love.  Lol  Update:  1/1/2018.  Its been one week since Christmas and unfortunately, Im really disappointed.  My son has been being very gentle with Gizmo and hes falling apart.  Hands are loose, fur is fraying all over.  It makes me sad because my 5 year old is in love with him!  I keep using a glue gun to try and reinforce him.  What a bummer.  Unfortunately, don't waste the money.	-1
Terrible quality	-1
Horribly made	-1
Not what I though! Says six inches but it looks like it could be a keychain if you put a ring on it. Kids where very disappointed!	-1
This is a real piece of junk.  The hands, feet, and ears are very hard plastic.  The fur is not soft at all and there is very little stuffing.  The seams are glued together and the glue is very sloppy with some excess glue.  It is not really 6 inches either. More like 4.5 or 5".  The only way I could measure 6" was from one ear diagonally to the foot - after I stretched it.  This feels like something you might get in an arcade claw game - not a fifteen dollar item	-1
I ordered a PLUSH GIZMO not an electronic one that can't be played with by my young grandchild.	-1
Ordered this yesterday. It arrived today and my son was thrilled. He cannot stop talking about Mogwai - he played with it very gentley building a house around it , pretending to tuck it in - and the foot already fell off! I won't be sending it back because he is really in love with it but the construction of this item is terribly cheap	-1
I am so disappointed in this doll. It's fur is patchy and hard, the face is hard to see through the poor glue job of the doll, and it does not look like the picture. If you love Gremlins as much as I do, buy a different mogwai. This one is not worth it.	-1
Lacks a lot of detail and his face is just a mess. Glue on every plastic piece.	-1
it was in my opinion not that greatly made. there was alot of glue around the ears and they seem if u pulled at them they would come off. they eyes didn't look that great either	-1
I read all the reviews for this little Gizmo and it sounded like about half of the people had bad luck, and the other half were fine with the product.  I happen to be part of the half that had bad luck.  He doesn't look anything like the picture or Gizmo from the movies.  His fur was plastered with glue around one eye, his feet, his ears, and his hands.  So plastered, I couldn't cut it or brush it out to make it look normal.  He's tiny, like beanie baby (remember those?) tiny.  The description said 6 inches tall but he's definitely not.  My Gizmo was very lucky in the sense that one leg was about an inch longer than the other, so he looked extra busted. Fur fell out everywhere, does he have mange?  Everything he touched, he left a wad of fuzz.  I would deal with the quality if I had paid roughly one dollar for him, but sadly, I did not.  I bucked up and bought the singing Gizmo and even though it is the same company, the quality is amazingly better.  He's super cute and looks like the real deal.  Do not get this Gizmo, pay the difference and get the other one.  I'm awaiting my refund as we speak...	-1
This was actually a gift and I feel bad my sister had to waste her money. This was not at all worth buying. Upon opening this toy, the box was already falling apart. The Gizmo it self was disappointing, the ears,hands and plastic feet were poorly glued on. One of the hands was dangling. The eyes were cock-eyed and the mouth piece was also poorly glued on. It just seems the final execution of this toy was over looked. There was glue residual causing the fur to look flat not plushy! and parts of the seems were sticking out. This was a gift for my daughter and when she held it in her hands her smile quickly turned into a sad face and she didn't think twice running away from it. In my book it deserves half a star not one/.	-1
Mine arrived looking like a refugee from a war-torn African nation.  The hair is coarse, spiky in places, falling out, mixed with a thread that is coming out from under his chin, and glued stiff around the eyes.  The glue around his eyes scratches and is obvious.  A mesh fabric flap juts out from under his chin.  It looks like crocheting fabric.  Just a horrible toy.  What a waste of money.  NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE SHOWN.	-1
not bad for the price but i don't like the color of the hands ears and feet it was off from the picture i also notice a lot of glue around some of the ears mouth and eyes all and all not bad	-1
I bought this figure so that my daughter could play with it. As soon as I removed it from the package, a hand and leg fell off. Just like that...didn't even touch those parts of the body and they fell out as if they were just placed in there.	-1
Tiny! Not as expected. If your looking for a min cat in the hat set to is it.	-1
Very cute but the stitching is coming undone on them and my son only has had them since Christmas. Really disappointing because we love Manhattan toy company	-1
I bought this as a possible favor for my 6-year-old son's Spy Training sleepover party, thinking it would be fun for the boys to run around with in the dark. But, it is tiny (about the length of my thumb) and really more like a red light than anything else. As someone else mentioned, you can see very little through the "lense." My son used it for a couple minutes as a "laser," and then abandoned it. For a couple dollars more, we are going with the Night Vision Goggles by the same company, which are actually binocular-sized and have many more features.	-1
This was the only Padme belt/holster I could find on Amazon and the item is described as fitting "most adults and big kids". Yeah, I don't think so buddy. I couldn't even get it around the most slim part of my waist and I am by no means heavy.  Padme's belt is meant to be slung around the hips, so there is absolutely *no* chance it would fit an adult properly.  It does, however, fit my 5 year old perfectly. Even then, it is incredibly poorly made. The holster is *barely* glued on and the materials are pretty cheap. The velcro is very weak and the belt comes undone easily. Judging from the packaging the item arrived in it is at least several years old.  I would return it if I didn't need the blaster for my costume.	-1
The gun is ok, the belt is terrible.  It broke after one day.	-1
I bought this for my 8 year old who absolutely loves it. Nice that it can be used inside especially when it is cold and rainy. We live in the Midwest. After not playing with it a couple of months, my son opened it up to play with and the sand was MOLDY.  He was very upset and cried. Great toy, but mold??? Now I have to see if I can find replacement sand and clean the mold off all the toys or get a new box. I have reservations because of the mold.  Any body else have a mold issue? This toy was not purchased through Amazon, but at a local toy store. Just wanted to let others know there may be a mold issue if it sits for a while.	-1
description and picture is misleading it looks like nice wood, and its plastic garbage, no glue included, bad job from a company maybe for 12.00 it would be worth it if its described acurately	-1
I'm a huge fan of LeapFrog toys.  But this one never clicked for my twins.  When they were younger it took to long to accomplish each turn and as they got older, it was just boring.  At every turn, the game tells kids what to do, then they find a letter card and put it in a special slot.  But there's just so much talking and singing going on, the kids get bored.  They want a game that moves quickly and this one doesn't do it.	-1
The good:  My 18 monnth old son plays with this toy for a while, loves the music, and has favorite "pages" with each cartridge.  Ours does have a volume control, so the "low" volume isn't bad at all. The Bad:  The microphone stopped working within 3 weeks, the screen is really dark, and the pages get "stuck" if the batteries are low. All in all, there are better toys out there...can anyone say My first Leappad?	-1
We just unwrapped this for the holidays and I hate it. My kids are a bit older (4,7) and to me it would be great for a 2,3 year old. It's really small and the thing says GOAL loudly whenever the net is hit, not just when the target is hit. It's overpriced if you ask me.	-1
My son never played with it. The score alarm goes off quite easily and the nets not very deep. The ball included is about the size of a grapefruit. It's lightweight and easy to assemble.	-1
It's 'ok', i mean yeah it's a net and you can kick a ball into i but it is TINY. I was surprised when it arrived, I guess I should have measured. it's almost too small for my 3 year old.	-1
waste of money really upset that this broke after first use. The idea behind the toy is great just wish they could get their stuff together ...come on fisher price... every thing I buy from you guys seems to break!	-1
it's good for big adult hands, (like man size), but way to big for a childs hands.  the puppet was twice the size of my grand sons hand!  More like a doll without feet.	-1
these do not light up!	-1
Piece of junk, does not make a clear, tight connection with other tracks. P.S. You need 2 of these unless you are adding on. If just starting, you'll need 2 to make a 2nd complete circle.	-1
Bought these tracks when I purchased a train set. The tracks took forever to ship, then when they did arrive, imagine the disappointment on my son's face when they didn't fit the track from the train, although the description said they would. Would not recommend.	-1
The train engine derails too often!  The switch is inconsistent & does not operate dependably.	-1
I wonder if the makeup of ingredients had changed over the years? When I was younger my pieces came out. Wry strong, I still have old figurines I created long ago that are still as tough as nails. This product was both too soft and not strong enough after baking. I was pretty disappointed by just how fragile the pieces were. I had even tried a few experiments on length of time in the over and temperature, changing it up doesn't seem to matter. - I used PREMO which is by far, much stronger! Another issue I have with this clay is that the colors, especially the rich colors, tend to stain your skin and leave a residue on your fingers. Although the clay might be good for beginners or a younger audience, it's not a very good clay for pieces that require strength.	-1
got one brand new from e Bay and all it does is make the train jump the tracks or stop in the middle of the road,,, it looks good but that is about it, it will end up on a side track whth no traffik,,,junk	-1
So so	-1
It stinks!  I mean it really smells bad and sprays a very fine mist all over the place so I think I can live without using it.	-1
Maybe I just got an old bottle, but this glue won't bond anything very well.  I had to use some crazy glue instead.	-1
This is a great model kit.....If you have the experience,and know how, to fabricate your own parts. The Revell parts in my kit are terrible as far as fit goes. The cockpit glass, both front and rear, are a joke. Both left and right side engine nacelle's have major fitting issues, and leave terrible gaps,so be ready to fill in the spaces with plenty of putty. After several hours of repair work that should not have been necessary, I have a nice kit, but, when purchasing a model kit, this many modifications should not be necessary.	-1
I thought this was a toy my grandson could play with, but instead it was a model.  I didn't know anything about models and how to read about them, so it was my fault.	-1
The Black Widow is one of my favorite airplanes of WW2. The model I have is one of the original Monogram 1:48 scale that a friend sold to me. This model has some nice details, and good instructions, however there a major problems with the parts fitting together. There has to be a lot of sanding and trimming in order to make it work, even then there are too many gaps here and there particularly with the fuselage, and windows. This is not a model for a beginner because of the fit issues, but with patience and a bit of modifying it can be a nice model.	-1
One of the poorest kits I have ever built and I've been buildin' 'em since the mid sixties. Poor instructions, lots of flash on small areas, the plastic 'glass' doesn't fit well at all, the interior compartments are too hard to work on, all the access doors have flimsy hinges, and I could go on but this will be my last kit from this manufacturer - you get what you pay for. A lot of putty, file work and profanity will be needed. I was going to give one (I bought two) to a friend for Xmas but now I can't get any of the canopy's to fit along with a few other issues. The wings and props are okay and once you manage to glue and paint the main fuselage and wings it looks okay in pieces. This partial build will go out with Monday's trash and I'll donate the unopened other kit somewhere. Not sure how the other builder's managed their models, but these fingers won't touch another Revell kit and I'd advise others to beware and ignore the box art. Two propeller blades for this waste of time and money and paint.	-1
no clue nothing guess its my fault for not reading everything lol I thought It was a die cast model done put together hahaha	-1
This has to be one of the worst plastic model of anything made It is like trying to fit and glue two pieces of paper edges together  It is not even worth the postage cost I can't believe they sell this type of crap  This is my first ever type of rating of any product I have purchased Is this bad enough to get a refund? Dam sure is Get back to me please Thanks Paul E	-1
The only star it gets is for the cheap price. I've been doing models since the late 60's and came resurrected a year and a half ago and surprised that Revell has gone down this far. This is the worst model I've come across so far - too thin plastic, misaligned parts, excess plastic in all parts and the trees. All these can be remedied of course with tons of puttys, super glues, sandpaper, x-acto, files and a lot of days which can be better off spent on other brand, esp the Tamis and the Hasegs ..... I am tempted to get this one to the trash can just like the review I just read here ... :-(	-1
If i could rate it lower i would. Poor fit,thin glass parts. The whole model was very thinly made,but mainly just very poor fit.	-1
Very poorly designed kit, difficult to build. The cabin sides were badly warped and lacking locator ribs. The nose section didn't align with the cabin. The nose grenade launcher is an indistinct lump. The side windows didn't align properly, if you clamp the sides so the side windows are flush the cabin walls will be bowed. If you align the sides based on the nose frame the side windows will gape............I'm surprised at Revell, they usually do a better job with aircraft..  I'm an experienced model builder and i had difficulty assembling this mess, it is NOT for an inexperienced model builder.	-1
This kit belongs back in the '70s.  Much better, more modern kits are available for just a little more money.  I just slapped this one together for use as a "paint mule."	-1
Wasn't what I thought it was honestly, but you get what you pay for.	-1
Nothing to like here. I mean the canopy fit is nice and you can model the tail wheel closed (the instructions don't list the part, but it's on the sprue), but that's about it. The assemblies were boring, the intake on the belly looks disgusting and in my opinion shouldn't have a seperate piece for the lip itself, the instructions are vague and not once is the right side of the plane shown anywhere in them or on the box, they're full of errors, and the nose decal is the worst I've worked with. Looks like garbage even after hours of work. It's presentable now, sort of, but wretched compared to all my other finished kits, save maybe my very first plastic kit I ever made, an Airfix B-25. And that thing, while trashy, was a product of poor workmanship on my part. I am not nearly the same modeler now as I was when I ruined that B-25, so that makes this decal situation that much more baffling. Was it even made for this plane?!? I'm sorry I can get all the seams fit super tight, I know Revell kits weren't designed with that in mind, but it almost seems as if the nose decal was designed to fit around a wider, poorly assembled fuselage instead of a streamlined, tight fitting one. Granted, I didn't have much heart in this build, P-51's don't interest me so much for whatever reason. More of a build I did just to have a Mustang in the WWII collection really. I actually much prefered the P-40B kit, which is not a compliment in any sense. If you don't want a polished kit with a presentable outcome, this kit would be fine. Beginners, a history enthusiast with no serious interest in scale models, kids, gifts to vets... All things this kit is good for. But if you want a pleasant build where you can focus on the subject matter and produce a quality piece of craftsmanship at the end of it, you can do far better. I generally like Revell, some of their kits are fun just to fix up! But this adds yet another strike to my opinion of their pricepoint molds and the company in general. Revamp these molds and up the overall quality of the product please! Obviously you get what you pay for if you take advantage of Revell's significant catalogue of iconic war planes.	-1
It doesn't look at all like the picture , disappointed!	-1
Didnt tell me the age group until it arrived, way to complecated for my 4 year old. Vey basic, no paint, no glue, way to much money for what it is. Gave it away.	-1
I've always liked Revell and have many fond memories of building their models when I was a kid.  Heck, I still have most of them.  However, I've been working with my son to put this together and it is appalling how terrible the part to part fit on this model is.  The nose and fuselage areas have huge gaps between the pieces.  I've built many models and never have I seen one this bad.  Sorry Revell, never again.  I'm switching to Tamiya.	-1
This IS a review system so that people can see others experiences with a particular item BEFORE buying it. I think you forgot that part. I rely on this and If ppl were not truthful, it totally defeats the purpose.	-1
We bought this for our son to play with.  He loves Dora...and we were excited at first, but that went away quickly.  This thing falls apart!  We can't keep the two islands connected, they keep coming apart, and the tree doesn't stay in the stand.  And in ours, Swiper isn't seen very often.  He doesn't spin around the way he's supposed to when we pour water in it.  Very disappointed.	-1
My 2yr old twins received this toy for their birthday; i also have a 4 yr old son. This toy is so large there is barely enough room for my kids; if one is in at a time it's fine but if more than one child is in the tub this thing is too big. It does not stay together & this frustrates my kids.  When they are done I hardly know where to keep all the pieces!  I have sinced stashed the island in the linen closet & we play with the Dora, Boots and Diego that came with it.  My kids love the characters and they have the Large Dora & Boots 'splash around fun' dolls for the tub - much better and well constructed.	-1
We received this toy as a gift when our daughter was about 3 months old.  I took an immediate dislike to the loud, obnoxious noise the thing made in its "demo" mode, but decided to avoid the hassle of exchanging it and instead brought it to Grandma's house to keep on hand as a toy to use during visits.  Assembly was a real pain.  I've assembled everything from my daughter's exersaucer to an entire walk-in closet system, and I've never had the problems that I had with this thing.  Getting the overhead bar in correctly took ages, and for awhile it looked like it wouldn't snap in firmly at all.  Forget about following the directions for this one.  When attaching the bar, don't screw in the screws completely (as the directions instruct) or you won't be able to move it.  Leave the screws loose, get it snapped into position (the most challenging part, whether it's in the upright infant or the lower toddler position) and then tighten.  Make sure that in the infant setting the bar is completely snapped in on both sides, or it will torque disconcertingly in the direction of the un-snapped end and the base will lift up off the floor and make the toy extremely unstable.  As for playing with the toy, my daughter didn't really have trouble reaching the hanging toys with her feet as some other reviewers' children did.  However, she had to kick the toys just right in order to set off the music and lights, and it would often take several attempts to turn the music and lights on.  The toys also don't move back into their original positions once they've been kicked, so they get progressively farther away and more difficult to trigger every time the baby does manage to kick one.  When it does get going, the toy really is loud and obnoxious.  The music is anything but melodious - it sounds like a bad video game - and did I mention that even on its lowest setting it's still LOUD?  It didn't frighten my daughter the way it did some other reviewers' babies, but I can easily see how it could.  Finally, this toy doesn't stay put.  It doesn't weigh enough to withstand the kicks of the baby using it, so after each kick it slides across the floor and farther out of baby's reach.  I had to sit on the floor next to my daughter and hold the toy in place.  This was on carpet - I can only imagine how much farther it would have slid on hardwood or tile floors!  What this toy needs is an attached fabric "blanket" for the baby to lie down on so the baby's weight would keep the toy from sliding around.  Since my daughter isn't sitting up by herself yet, we haven't tried this toy in its upright position.  However, from what I can see of it, it doesn't do all that much in that setting.  Once the toddler pops the balls off the carousel, they only roll down a short ramp and then stop.  Yes, they set off the lights and music, but there's no "flow" to the balls.  Once they're at the bottom of the short ramp, that's it - there's no place else for them to go.  The toddler can pick them up and fling them around the room, I suppose, but unless an adult is there to pop the toys back into the carousel so the process can start over again, I can see the actual playtime being quite short.  Overall, I'd say don't waste your money on this one, and if you get one as a gift, bring it to an understanding grandparent's house where your child can enjoy it in small doses and with a loving adult nearby to help in the play.	-1
man!!!!  I wish I had read these reviews!  this looked so cool at the store... I really like to buy toys that change as the baby grows.  I thought that maybe, the foot platform would be something that would trigger something if the baby kicked it... but no.  I think when she can sit up to play with it, she might like it, but for the price... don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
My son has had this toy since he was 1 month old.  We've tried introducing it several different times.  Everytime he will quickly loose interest and get cranky.  The music is also quite loud.  He is now 8 months old and this toy is collecting dust in the corner.  Definatly not worth the high price.	-1
I bought this for my daughter at 4 months, because I liked that the toy can grow with her from laying down to sitting up.  But I sure wish I had read these reviews before buying it.  Like everyone says, the music is very loud and super annoying.  When she would lay on her back it was awkward for her to kick straight ahead to hit the base of the toy.  She did kick the spinning toys pretty good and that would thrill her for awhile.  But even then she couldn't stand to play with it for more than 5 minutes tops.  Now she can sit, but she is not yet old enough to place the balls in the spinner so they go down the ramps.  The only use we get out of the toy now is when we hold a spinning toy in our hands and she bats at it.  Certainly not worth the money I paid for it.	-1
We bought this for my daughter a month ago because she fit into the age recommendation. This toy was basically a HUGE waste of money. I'm very disapointed in Fisher Price for making such a boring toy. The balls are hard for me to pull off of the wheel so you can imagine how it must be for my daughter. The music is very annoying and one of the attachments already broke. I can't believe this thing cost $35.00. I'm very disapointed and I wish I could return it, but I threw out the box before I gave my daughter a chance to play with it.	-1
Wish I would have read the reviews here before buying.  I was tempted to return it also.  I got this when my daughter was two months because a friend recommended getting a toy she could kick.  Well she kicks it alright but the thing never responds.  I even called customer service thinking something was wrong with it.  I had to smack the thing really hard to get it to work.  The fisher price rep told me the settings are different sensitivities but I am not impressed.  I am encouraged by the other reviews and maybe she will like it when she is older.  She is almost 3 months old now and seems interested in watching the lights on the continuous setting.  I wouldn't recommend this for a newborn as the box suggests.  Live and learn.	-1
As everyone else, I was so excited to buy this exercise and foot coordinated toy for my son of 2 months. ( I should have read the reviews first!!)  I was amazed at how many screws it took to assemble the unit. After taking the time to get it put together I found that it didn't matter where the baby kicked, the music would go off anyway. I let my son have a go at it and even though he was kicking hard and setting off the music, it would slip away from him and then he couldn't reach it. And when he was just kicking lightly nothing would happen. I though this toy would encourage him to coordinated his kicking with a reward, but it only made him cry when he would kick and not get a response. THERE ARE BETTER FOOT ACTIVATED TOYS OUT THERE!! Don't bother with this one!! I thought Fisher-Price would have a better understanding of what mom's expect when it comes to their baby's learning and exercise.  When looking for a foot activate toy make sure you find something that rewards your baby no matter how hard or soft they kick, a toy that is activated in the area where the baby kicks, not by vibration like this toy.  I am RETURNING this toy and purchasing something else.	-1
I asked for this toy for my second child becasue my oldest had a similar kick toy (no longer on the market) that she loved so much, she wore out the motor! Well, this one was such a disappointment. It has little footprints which imply that if you kick there, the music will play, but if you kick it anywhere or simply bump into it, the music starts - this totally defeats the "cause & effect" educational value to the toy. The dangling toys are too far away for the baby to reach and do not move easily or do anything when kicked. The baby tires of it and rolls away from it after about three minutes. I was hopeful that it would become worthwhile after I transformed it to a sitting-up toy, but like others have said, it is hard to get the balls and basically just frustrates the baby.	-1
I bought this gym thinking that my baby would be able to kick to turn it on and be "rewarded for his physical accomplishments," like the box says.  The little feet are on a plastic  "door"  that does absolutely nothing, you just flip a switch and your baby gets 5 minutes of music and lights.  He couldn't even reach the toys when he tried to grab them.  I said it's unsafe because it wobbles like crazy and the "ferris wheel" is very heavy and would seriously hurt a baby if it fell on them.  I thought maybe I put it together wrong, so I had my brother who fixes military helicopters put it together again, but it still wobbled so much I was very uncomfortable putting my baby under it.  I think this toy should have a recall until Fisher Price fixes it.  I'll be returning this to Babies'R'Us tomorrow.	-1
I read customer reviews and thought this toy gonna be a hit. No! My son never paid any interest to this toy. It's super bulky. Also....20 for this cheap looking you? You can buy 2 lamaze toys for that price and they are much cuter and entertaining to a baby. Or skip hop owl which is almost the same price. I'm extremely disappointed.	-1
I thought this would be the perfect toy for my 18 month old who loves Elmo.  He has a couple of Elmo dolls but the fur on this one is poor quality and sheds on everything.  It also says "Hop like a Cat" and "Skip like a Pig" a couple of other phrases that don't make sense.  The Elmo I received didn't look like the one in the picture.  He has a shirt that says Elmo on it and a little dog.  My son loves Hokey Pokey Elmo and could care less that this Elmo knows his name.	-1
Sure you have to point the arrow FIRST and THEN spin the stupid thing- that is not how is it supposed to work! Hate it! Returning it!	-1
This toy was small and very cheaply made.  The large lever was very difficult for my child to pull down and he quickly gave the toy up.  The same toy years ago was much larger and heavier than this one.  It was not impressive at all.  The sounds don't always match the picture.  Maybe this will work better for my child when he is 2 or 3 years old.  I would not recommend this toy.	-1
My daughter has had this toy for about 2 years and has rarely played with it.  She does, however, have two of the old "classic" see and says that the neighbor kid gave us.  The old ones get more play time for sure.  The "quiz mode" is too complicated for the younger ones.  If they don't know how to answer the question, it will get stuck in that mode until someone gives it the correct answer.	-1
My one year old keeps trying to like this toy - the potential is there - but he has difficulty holding the toy up and pulling the leaver.  When he does have success his little finger inevitably gets pinched between the spinning arrow and the side of the toy. He's 16 mos old now and pretty much ignores the toy now.	-1
I purchased this toy for my 10 month old.  I agree with a few other reviewers that the sound quality is poor.  It sounds like a radio station that is not quite on the correct frequency coming from really poor speakers.  In addition, the volume isn't loud enough (perhaps because of the muffled sound).  After pulling the lever, I have a very difficult time understanding what it is saying until after the arrow stops spinning.  By the time the arrow stops, the phrase is 1/2 over and you've missed the first part of the sentence.  I even have this complaint when there isn't any background noise.  Imagine if there were other kids playing in the room or the dishwasher running.  If the sound quality were better, the words more easily understood, and it had a volume control; I would have been willing to pay twice as much, and would have given it 4-5/5 stars.  I also think it would be nice if  it described the animal on which the arrow stops, instead of the animal on which the arrow starts when you pull the lever.  Too bad there isn't an option for a higher quality one.  Perhaps there is, and I just don't know about it.  My mother-in-law purchased this for my nephew.  She had the same complaints about the sound.  Wish I'd talked to her first.	-1
I loved See and Say as a child, and I couldn't wait to get one for my toddler. I got this for him when he was 16 months old. If the toy actually worked consistently, it would be great. But half the time, we pull the lever and it just spins without saying anything. We have to pull it just right, kind of slowly, and have it on one of a few select animals, then it will work. When it does work, he loves it. I'm really disappointed.	-1
This was one of my favorite childhood toys so my daughter got it for Christmas.  Half of the time, no sound comes out, it just spins.  Plus it is much smaller and has too many animals.	-1
This is a really cute toy and a good idea.  But when you turn the "page" it doesn't recognize the new animals.  It will say the animal that is in that spot when the page is turned the other way.  For example the sheep is at the top left when the page is on the left.  Then when you turn it and there's a cat in that spot it still says sheep.  I would think this would get very confusing and frustrating for a child who is just learning their animals and sounds.  Maybe I just got a defective one...	-1
This is a bad replacement for the classic! It uses batteries so the lever is useless. It does nothing but make the sounds unaudible with extra rumbling. It doesnt need the extra page because the extra animals on the other page, the song, and the quiz are all unrecognizable. The reduced size is a plus, but the handle is hard to pull for my 2 year old. So no sounds come out since the handle didn't get pulled correctly. I remember the classic being a much better toy because it would play on all pulls, the sounds were great, and the size was perfect for laptop play. Blah, for $10 it was not worth it!	-1
not as high quality as i was led to believe.  these have a grittiness that causes them to be too thick and blotchy on the paper. yuk!  after about a dozen attempts, i don't even use them any more.  in hindsight i should have returned the paints for a refund.	-1
First I thought is was getting two for my twin. Nieces. I had to go to Target and buy another ball. Second, it came deflated so had to get a pump and needle. This is not worth buying as the kids could care less about where to place tinier hands plus it just didn't bounce well.	-1
The slide will not stay together. The pegs for the slots in the front do not fit the pegs on the slide itself. My daughter has me putting it back together every couple of minutes. What a disappointment.	-1
The slides do not go together as it should - and it's clearly not a single faulty unit.  We're going to try superglueing it together as our daughter really wants this.  Her other Polly Pocket toys in her collection are of much better quality, it seems to be just the slides... Talk your child into some other Polly POcket item than this one.  Or buy glue ahead of time.	-1
Though Polly Pocket dolls are played with a lot in my house, the Wild Waves Castle was only used once. It is cumbersome when assembled, tippy, and doesn't work like it's supposed to. Because some water splashes from the slides, I put the base in a waterproof tray for play. Disassembled, it just sits there because it's not worth the trouble to snap it all back together again. This toy is an invitation for a mess of water on your floor and it's a pain to store.	-1
The Silver Surfer is pretty much why I don't buy Toy Biz figures without looking at them **very** closely. What the web pictures don't show are how poorly the "points of articulation" are designed in the figure. The plastic joints, "rivets", and ball-and-socket points are very visible, making the Silver Surfer something of a metallic Frankenstein. Perhaps its the position of his head, but it seems as if his head is out of proportion to the rest of his body. Howard the Duck fared much better. Despite an oddly blank look, his clothes are well-detailed, even to the polka-dots on his tie and pattern on his coat. His trademark cigar, however, is missing. As a Howard the Duck fan, I purchased this figure, but, otherwise, I would not recommend it.	-1
Not what I exspected at all. Thought it would be fun to write little messages for my husband on our board. These are basically poetic and that is it. No easily used words to create sentences at all. You can have little blurbs. Also the words were very limited.	-1
I can't get this stuff to stick -unpainted plastic, primed plastic, painted plastic- for more than a few moments.  Well, if I'm masking a straight line on a flat surface it works.  Don't touch it once you have it where you want it, though.  As for masking anything even remotely intricate, this stuff is useless.  I've had no issues with generic masking tape, and I can get in some really tight areas with it.  Not this stuff.	-1
Big mistake.  This thing is too small unless you are into 'N' gauge.  This thing is too short to activate mose HO locos.  I guess buying 2 and putting them end to end would work but that gets expensive.  There are better options on the market.  Check YOUTUBE for track and loco cleaners.	-1
returned	-1
I was very disappointed in its size. I feel the size should have been given.	-1
If I could give this no stars, I would. I was expecting a decent sized bag for a toddler not a coin purse! This cost me $20 and was not worth the money at all! It looks like a dollar store item. Grrr....	-1
Be sure to read dimensions.  It is tiny for the price and the soccer ball makes annoying noises.	-1
Much, MUCH, smaller than I anticipated for the price...I should have looked for dimensions. Bag is about six inches long. Balls are slightly larger than a ping pong ball.  Should be less tiny or less expensive.	-1
This is a cute toy but, like another review said, it is TINY compared to what I expected. We bought it as a gift and I was disappointed that it didn't come in a box or package of any kind, was mailed to us in a bag.	-1
Ridiculously small!!! Can't believe how small it is actually. Not worth the price. I would not recommend and I would not reorder it	-1
The seller was nice enough however the item was super small! I think the baby items have reduced in size from the manufacturer. Not sells fault although it did take a while for item to get here.	-1
Using the Color Wonder Finger Paints is basically like dipping your hand in Vaseline.  It's greasy, hard to wash off, and stains.  I would never buy this again nor for anyone else.  I strongly urge against purchasing this product.  Crayola, shame on you!	-1
I'll admit my kid is younger than the suggested age for these...  he just turned 2...  but I'm sure I'm not the only parent thinking this looks like a good way to keep toddlers entertained.  ;-)  MAYBE you'd have better luck with an older child.  Bear that in mind.  I bought a bunch of Color Wonder markers, paints, paper, and coloring books back in August when we were flying from CA to MI.  I thought it would keep my kid occupied on the plane.  It didn't...  but that's another story.  We got all this stuff out again recently thinking he might be more into it.  He seems to like the markers now, more or less.  But not the paint.  The problem with the color wonder stuff in general is, it takes time for the color to appear on the page.  It's a very weird sensation...  you are coloring with a marker and nothing is happening.  The color starts to appear in about a second, but it takes a few seconds for the colors to *fully* develop.  The paints seem to take longer to develop than the markers.  The other problem with the paints is they are really soft.  Kind of like a tub of lip gloss...  very tempting for little fingers to dig around in.  It seems my kid gets more fun out of digging in the paint than he does painting with these.  I am thinking an older child *might* be inclined to paint rather than dig.  But then I am thinking an older child could be trusted better with normal paints so why would you get these in that case anyway?  The time delay plus squish factor made these a big disappointment for us.  Your milage may very and it's not like you're going to need to take out a second mortgage to try these out. They're cheap enough.  If they're a hit, great.  If they flop, not a huge deal.  I suggest the markers over the paints, though.  And I suggest the plain paper over the coloring books, FWIW.  The coloring books are kind of weird in that only the area inside the lines defining the picture can be colored.  At least with the books we have.  Say you have a picture of a seal.  You can only color inside the seal.  You can't draw a fish or a ball or your name or anything outside the seal, because only the paper inside the drawing is coated with whatever it is that makes the Color Wonder colors show up.  The coloring books aren't terrible...  it's just kind of weird/frustrating that you CAN'T color outside the lines.  Sometimes you want to add a little extra.	-1
I got this pool for my 2yo twins... The picture is extremely misleading, it's much smaller and there is hardly any room for three children. The description gives two sizes as well, but it's definitely not bigger than 40 inches.	-1
Great size! NO hole to drain the pool is surprising and probably why it developed a hole on the bottom after two uses. Leave water in longer than 2 days even covered and it gets gross. Need to drain it and it makes it a pain without the plug to pull to let water out. Even just filling it to the first ring the two times it was used took 20 min to drain again. My son loved the size but now I have to look for a different pool.	-1
After reading all the reviews stating they'd ordered  a larger size, but ended up receiving a smaller 4' size, I thought there wouldn't be a problem because I WANTED the 4' size.  However, I ended up w/the 5 1/2' size!!!!  I decided I could make that work, but discovered that the top 2 of the 3 inflatable rings wouldn't stay inflated.  The only plus was that Amazon.com staff was great about facilitating the return & S&H.  Though I gotta say, for the price, I was wondering why I bothered as it was really difficult to get it back in the box!!	-1
So the tag on this specific item CLEARLY states 45", and as per the previous reviews I received the WRONG size!  They still haven't gotten this right.  I bought this to be a ball pit for my LO as one of his xmas gifts, complete FAIL.  I requested a refund and Amazon told me I can receive the refund and just keep it because I've been a good customer.  Haven't even opened the darn box to see if this thing inflates.  Whatev....	-1
This pool was great when I got it. We just left ours outside, so the life of it wasn't that long. It ended up getting a hole after 2-3 months. Other than our mistake, it was easy and quick to setup and my 2 Year Old loved it!	-1
Notice there are 2 photos with this product. One photo shows 3 kids sitting in the pool and the other photo shows 1 girl sitting in the pool. These are pictures of two different sized pools. I ordered this pool because the description says it is 66". It is not 66". The pool I received (the package matches the picture with one girl sitting in the pool) actually says it is 45". That's a big difference than the 66" I thought I was getting. I'm very frustrated. I didn't investigate this until after I inflated the pool and noticed it was much smaller than I expected. That's when I went back and looked at the packaging a little closer. Yes, the picture matches what is displayed here on Amazon, but it is NOT 66", it is 45". What a let down.	-1
Product Features: Measures 66" x 16"  From the Manufacturer: Pool measures 45" x 10"  Product Description: 66" x 16"  So, which one will I get?	-1
Received this as a gift for our 18 month old, and it really doesn't hold her interest at all (even if I sit down and try to read it to her).  All she wants to do is rip the book off the holder and try to "read it herself".  I will say that the pages are durable, and do not tear.  I think the book is a little too advanced for the age groups listed.  Possibly 2 or 2.5 yr olds would have a better attention span, and the knowledge to push the graphics to get the audio feedback from the book.  One other thing is that every time you turn the page, you have to "push" the a green button on the page, so the pad knows what page you are on - I don't know how good any child under the age of 3 would be with this - so most reading would have to be "with an adult" - otherwise - the child just does not get anything out of the book.  I personally like the pad (and it's books) and hope that in time, our daughter will get more out of it.  Will write an update if she does show interest.	-1
Didn't work	-1
All of the reviews here are for the larger robot, not the mini.  My 9-year-old purchased the mini for her brother's birthday not realizing that the recommendations and discussions about the robot's capabilities did not apply at all to the mini.  She is very disappointed that the mini just rolls around, that's it.  Amazon needs to create separate listings for these very different robots.  Otherwise the listing is deceptive, especially for kids who are picking out a toy.	-1
Thank you	-1
Didn't work - had to return.	-1
we have two, yes two of these, they are a waste of money, and pretty much don't do anything special. save your cash and buy a robot you can maybe program with or you know, code! they sit on a shelf and get played with only when other kids come over, and then only for about 10 minutes when they figure out how boring they are.	-1
This thing arrived in a cardboard box with tape and twisty ties.. All it does is wobble. DOES NOT WALK, IT WOBBLES. Makes burping noises all the time. Just a waste. Not worth the extreme price. I'd say this is a 40 dollar toy. At best.	-1
I bought this from Blizzard LLC for my son's 8th birthday. It turns on just fine but doesn't respond to the remote or the thing you plug into your phone jack so I believe an IR sensor is busted inside of it. The tutorials to fix the IR sensor are complicated. Blizzard LLC was willing to accept the return but wanted me to pay to ship it back. Since we used a gift card, I would have been paying to ship back a "free" item. Nonetheless, I now have to buy him some other robot.	-1
It looks cool and fancy, but no kid has the patience to figure it out. As an adult I played with it for a while, but also soon got bored with it. Tons of buttons that all do very similar stuff...how many different ways can you really move an arm?? The things it says are dumb and you couldn't make them out if you didn't know what it was saying before pushing the button. That and it's onboxiously loud with no volume control. This one will go in the attic for a year or two. Maybe by then somebody will grow interested in it.	-1
10 minutes not working after work. After receiving the ship tried to run things. It is work. Run with the iPhone. It is work. Archive for the birthday gift of the son. Birthday did not work. Changed the batteries twice. It does not work. The total operating time of 10 minutes. Garbage .... The son of a depressing birthday.	-1
The robot does not seem to respond very well to either the remote or the ipad App. I would avoid it, its a waste of money.	-1
WORST robot!! After ordering two of these and them not working I gave up. Huge waste of money! I bought the Batman robot instead and its a million times better. Trust me, don't waste your time, money or expectations! I don't even want to give this even one star!!	-1
Bought this for my son for Christmas and it will not start. We have tried new batteries to no avail, and the only support is through an Internet form. No number to call. Terrible Christmas present!	-1
Good luck getting it out of the horrible packing job.  Try not to cut yourself.	-1
to kiddy	-1
Thing is pretty much crap. Im surprised the rereleased it. The novelty wears out fast. I bought one for my girlfriend,who loves this sort of thing and it sits in the closet collecting dust. Id say skip this one. The female version is much more fun.	-1
very poor toy for how much it costs and customer service is a joke!!  if you have a problem with it  you will pay big bucks to ship it back!!	-1
Got this for 2 yr old grandson's birthday, but he won't play with it: it goes too fast, and though he is slightly small for his age, his legs have to be very crunched-up to use the foot supports, so he seems very uncomfortable--maybe it was designed for smaller Asian kids? He also isn't coordinated enough to hold the 'power' button down and steer at the same time. By the time I saw all of this, it was too late to return it. Suggest the company SLOW DOWN the speed, and give a height requirement for a child to be able to fit on it, instead of just an age range. Very disappointed.	-1
Its bulky and amazon won't let me return it	-1
Disappointed in this little 4 wheeler. It barely crawls on grass or asphalt. Only works well on a paved driveway. The steering only turns about 5 degrees in either direction making it impossible to turn around.	-1
This toy is simply awful.  It only value as a toy is Rodimus Prime's character was the Autobots leader in the TV Series.  Many people blamed his character lack of a personality for the end to the series.  I blamed his generic toy-figure the end to the G1-Transformers. Hot Rod was cool because he transform into a futuristic sport car.  Rodimus Prime the "great leader" transforms into a RV trailer, not cool.  I bought the Takara's version and it had most of the toy covered up, when I opened it up it was so generic compared to earlier Transformers' products.  In RV trailer mode he looks OK or 4 out of 10.  In robot mode he is a 2 out of 10, it is that bad.  Rodimus Prime transforms similar to but simpler to Optimus Prime.  The trailer part becomes a battle station, while the front-part becomes the figure.  Rodimus is made mostly out of hard plastic and has very few interesting details.  He stand taller then the toy-figure version of Optimus Prime.  What I can say is Rodimus Prime's robot mode is the most humanistic of the Transformers I have seen.  He isn't fun to transform either, just too boring after awhile. You got to physically see how bad this is in your hand to notice you just/would waste(d) some money.  As a collector toy, Rodimus is predecessor to Optimus Prime and that is a must have.	-1
Doesn't even work.. wish I could send it back but I ripped up the box it came in.	-1
I've bought 2 of these.  Neither one lasted very long.  I bought them both from Wal-Mart,  not Amazon. They don't make very many bubbles. A friend has a bubble machine that makes tons of bubbles so I'm going with that one this time.	-1
Took my chances on this bubble machine and ended up with a dud. Machine wouldnt turn on and the entire bottom where the batteries go was extremely hot to the touch (machine wasn't even on for 1 minute) and a few of the batteries were starting to melt. Immediately returned to amazon - don't waste your money. Took my toddler to Walmart and found another brand that works like a charm.	-1
We received this less than a year ago as a birthday present. When working the product was fine, although you have to be careful when filling with bubbles because its very easy to spill.  Now it no longer works. For a while, the button on the back was finicky and you had to fiddle with it before it started working. Tried changing batteries, and that wasn't the problem. Now, I played with the button for ten minutes and it just doesn't work at all. Obviously my kids are disappointed, but I just threw it in the trash because I'm tired of dealing with it. Will be looking elsewhere for a new one!	-1

How come some other people giving 4 5 stars to this piece of junk.  It is poorly made Extremely fragile and low quality material Big time design failure. You are lucky if you could get 2 3 bubbles out of it Everything wiggles and wobbles No weight balance, tipped over on first touch Fan loud and strong enough Front bubble wheel not hold in place Not worth a dime!	-1
When it works-it's a beautiful thing. Bubble everywhere! Why only 1 star?  1)Batteries are a pain to insert-2 different barriers to get to. One with many screws and one that is hard to remove.  2) Tips over easily. Weighted wrong when filled and is unstable. This has fell over and made a mess overtime we have used it.  3) Not durable. After it fell over for the 10th time, quit working.  This really needs a redesign. Move on to another bubble machine. I have yet to find a good one.	-1
The first one of these we had was wonderful. Worked for 2 years, until we left it outside in the rain for a few days on accident. Ordered another one, this time with "Frustration Free" packaging, and it was dead. Did not work. Took the bubble tray out, and when I tilted it liquid started to slowly leak out of the housing. I stuck my fingers inside and wiped around, and there was already bubble solution on the inside of the machine itself! Apparently it was a customer return, and was just put back in a box and sent back out. NOT HAPPY. Had 2 very upset little toddlers. Will not order this again. At least not "Frustration Free" packaging.	-1
this thing was all messed up when I got it none of the batteries would make contact had to modify it so that it would work. Strait out of the box and I had to fix it.	-1
very poorly made. I guess you cant expect much from a $12 toy but I didn't think it took that much to make a bubble machine. Was going to return it for refund but the effort to drive 18 miles to closest UPS & buy a box to put it in is not worth the effort. WONT ever buy from this company again	-1
Spills everywhere! The idea is nice but its not practical	-1
cheap small makes 3ft of bubbled area bummer	-1

But Im attaching a video showing how most of the bubble fluid will leak out during use. The small bubble bottle enclosed lasted less than 5 minutes. I bought a huge bottle that lasted 20 - mostly due to the leakage. The purple part you see on front holds the bubbles and is not securely attached. I have to click it back into place before each use. It is also tilted back so far you cannot fill it even to the fill line without leakage.	-1
Bubbles spill out unless it's placed on flat surface and takes six batteries. Reservoir must be refilled every ten to fifteen minutes.	-1
Worked well for about 20 minutes pushing out a slew of bubbles, but as soon as the someone touched it and it fell over, the liquid poured into the unit and seemed to kill the motor. This is great if you can maintain far enough from anyone to touch it, it is not very sturdy and tilts over very easily. I would recommend another unit as this will not last.	-1
Works poorly but as well as commercial units	-1
Broke easily.	-1
Bought four for gifts. Seems to break easily. Only got 2-3 uses out of it.	-1
This bubble machine is awful. It worked great for the first 5 minutes and then the wheel started skipping and making only a few bubbles. It leaks bubble solution everywhere and makes a huge mess. I should have returned it when I had the chance!	-1
I'd give this a zero if I could. The product is very poorly designed. The speed of the bubble making is fairly fast so you go through the entire bottle of bubbles in 10 minutes. Then it's top heavy so it just tips over very easily. And of course, when it tips over, the bubble solution spills out so you go through your bubble solution even faster. Look for something else.	-1
Leaked first time all over. Worked for few minutes and stopped.	-1
The instruction sheet doesn't explain that you need a tiny screwdriver to access the battery case, and the right size screwdriver isn't one that many people own. So after I ran out to buy one, it took a long time to remove all the tiny screws and put in 6 batteries, which is a lot!  So finally, I poured the bubble liquid into the reservoir, as depicted on the instructions, and it all poured through the bottom. This is very poorly constructed.	-1
You know this bubble machine is a pain in the arse.  It constantly needs to be filled.  Batteries every use.  And today when I went to use it, the on/off button broke.  Awesome.  Yeah I won't be buying this brand again.  We've used this machine 10 times tops.	-1
Stopped working too wuickly soni returned it	-1
the fan broke right away and the bubbles leak all over the place	-1
Broke after a couple uses. This is the 2nd time this happened.	-1
Broke after one week.	-1
Broke after a couple uses.  Do not buy	-1
If I could I will never give this product any star atall ! The quality is so bad that it will hurt your eyes when you look at it! Then it is keeping leaking leaking leaking! Will have it returned!	-1
Do not buy!  Manufacturer shipped this with key pieces missing so it was completely useless at the party we bought it for and ruined everyone's fun  How disappointing and unreliable	-1
The purple part that holds the bubble liquid wouldn't stay in, rendering the whole thing useless. I tried to tape it in place but even that didn't work. I bought this for my son's birthday party and wish I had tested it out before disappointing a bunch of kids that were expecting a gazillion bubbles. I'm returning it for a refund, hopefully I just got a defective one out of the bunch.	-1
junk  returned  it	-1
Clogged up too quickly and goes through bubbles really fast	-1
Great bubbles but it tips over very easily. Ours fell over and now it doesn't work. Only had it for a week and it's broken.	-1
The gazillion bubble hurricane machine did not work at all. I bought all new batteries and it still did not work. This was a big disappointment.	-1
really bad product.. my son used just one time!! and now don`t works	-1
This thing puts out a ton of bubbles if you have the right juice. HOWEVER! It only has 3 feet at the base. My toddler dumps it over super easy. The wind even blew it over one day. Seeing as how this is a kid toy for use outdoors you'd think they would make it a bit more stable. Every single time it tips ALLLLLL of the bubble juice spills out. Super disappointing because it is a lot of fun for her. Not to mention the refill juice isn't cheap. Oh, it also takes 6 AA batteries. SIX!!!  Needs a major redesign to put 4 feet on the bottom and run off less battery power and it would be perfect.	-1
The bubble machine works really well, the on/off switch is on the back. It is a little harder for my three year old to turn it on/off and usually ends in losing bubble solution.  The bubble solution does tip out easily. Update: used the bubble machine maybe five times and now it's leaking bubbles out the bottom and won't turn on at all. Very disappointed.	-1
Would not turn on...Used brand new batteries...Returning g for refund	-1
This bubble machine is amazing! My kids love it! I bought it last year for $5 at Walmart but because of a time constraint I had to order one on Amazon instead of looking for another sale. $15 and it didn't last from April 1 - April 24. Very disappointed that I'm throwing away $15 and it didn't even last a month.	-1
It worked awesome the first time we used it!  The 2nd time was ok but not as good as the 1st time.  By the 4th time we brought it out it was garbage. Really disappointing.	-1
Came disabled in mail. I put it back together and it wouldn't turn on. I tried 2 different set of batteries to be sure.	-1
Fan blade would keep hitting the back, finally it gave out and stopped working.	-1
Came with a super small amount of bubbles so you will need lots more!  Updated to state broke and stopped working after about 6 uses.	-1
I bought this for my daughter to use for her 2 1/2 year old son. It broke after just one time! We have bought two other brands in stores nearby and they don't work long at all either. I guess I should say that he loved it when it did work!	-1
Totally disappointed with this product. Its extremely loud! Takes 6 AA batteries and has no AC power cord option. It vibrates and spins when it shouldnt and if you set it in any other way other than perfectly flat it spill bubble solution out the front. Doesnt even blow bubbles consistently.	-1
This is my third from this company and every time it works for a week (or 48 hours) the company sends me another one and repeat this 8 times but my son loves it so I keeo buying new ones...so sad...	-1
Very easy to spill bubble liquid everywhere and it broke after using it one time. It tipped over and the battery section was soaked.	-1
This thing feels like a cheap piece of junk and proved to be just that. Broke on the second day. Highly disappointed.	-1
It required using ALL of the included soap within 3 uses (only a few minutes each use) so then we tried other bubble solution we had on hand and it barely works. So then we tried adding dish soap to our bubble solution and it works -slightly- better but not much. I shouldn't have to buy special bubbles for this.	-1
Came basically broken.  It moves so slowly and doesn't put much out.  I did have another one that worked great a year ago, but this one...stinks.	-1
Never worked.	-1
Had it for 4 months and it has broke already	-1
This product was just "meh."  It doesn't come with very much bubble solution, so that runs out pretty quickly.  The biggest problems are that the motor is annoyingly loud and it vibrates quite a bit, so it slowly vibrates across the table and would fall off if you didn't keep moving it back to its original spot or put a cloth under or around the base to secure it.	-1
Waste of money. My daughter was so excited for this, put a pack of brand new batteries in it, tested it for a minute and it worked fine then went rouse it again with her and it didn't work.	-1
Looks like it can put out a nice amount of bubbles but it leaks and I had to return. The leaking of course caused a big soapy mess.	-1
Blows bubbles too fast and uses up the bubble liquid at incredible speeds. Finding myself to buy bubble liquid constantly. Also leaks constantly as it fails to stand properly.	-1
Purchased for my 4 year old granddaughter's birthday party and it worked wonderfully.  Used it 2 other times and then it just died too late to return.  Didn't cost much but I think it should have lasted longer.  Very sad little girl here.	-1
leaks everywhere! blows nice bubbles	-1
Second time I'm buying this... first one was left out in the rain but was amazing and actually produced a hurricane of bubbles. This time around not so much. Only getting a couple bubbles at a time out of it. Super disappointed. I can blow bubbles faster than this machine came make them. My toddler is not impressed.	-1
This was okay for a while, but after two uses it broke, and I couldn't get the motor to turn on again.	-1
so i don't know if i am too stupid, i didn't realize that this toy is not very stable when put on ground, my 2 yo tippd it over easily by a small push and the fluid just went everywhere, is there any trick that i did not catch up? thanks for telling me anyone	-1
This is very unstable, easily tipped over by breezes. Within 2 hours it was no longer working, I think the spilled bubble solution got into the motor. Why wouldn't the motor be better protected from liquids? The reservoir is small and needed frequent refilling. A waste of money, time, and energy.  If you plan to use it where there are no external forces that might tip it over (breeze, children, pets, etc.), and have time to keep refilling it, then it might last longer than 2 hours.	-1
I have a one and two year who both love bubbles & could spend hours chasing them around our yard so I was so excited to find a well priced bubble machine that would provide my children with endless entertainment. the bubble machine worked great and does produce tons of bubbles...AS LONG AS you have it on a flat surface, facing the direction of the wind and making sure the bubble wand circle is sitting correctly on the spindle. Considering how temperament this product is and the frustration it can cause, I would not buy this product again.	-1
Broke the second time we used it, tried changing batteries thinking it drained them super quick but brand new batteries did not work.	-1
I bought this bubble machine to use at the daycare where I worked. It was tons of fun when it was functional, but it stopped working after about 10 minutes, which greatly disappointed the toddlers that were playing with it. It wasn't particularly cheap, either, considering what it is.  Wish there was a money back policy for it :/	-1

I love the Gazillion Bubbles bubble solution and cannot praise it enough.  This bubble machine, on the other hand, I cannot recommend.  It sits at an angle, which makes it wobbly and prone to tipping over even on flat surfaces.  The on/off switch is on the back and my 3-year old is used to being able to turn toys on and off herself.  Without fail, the entire unit tips over, dumps bubbles everywhere, and the pieces come apart.  That's another annoyance - the green bubble tray and yellow bubble wands disconnect from the main unit very easily.  They pop back on just as easily, but it's annoying especially when there's bubble solution in the tray.  Finally, though it's awesome that the battery compartment is at the top so the solution doesn't leak in and corrode the battery housing like on many other units, it has an odd lid that has to be pried off to get to the screws for the battery compartment, and then the screws were not easy to remove without a power tool.  Once this item bites the dust, we won't be purchasing it again.  On a side note, it does put out a good amount of bubbles provided there's no cross wind and the tray is sufficiently filled.	-1
Bought this for my kids 1st birthday party, worked great for about an hour until it just stopped working, it wasn't over filled with bubbles solution, the batteries were brand new (even switched them out with another set of new ones) and it wasn't even knocked over by the crowd of kids playing by it, it just stopped. Guess if you pay cheap you get cheap. Would not recommend this product to anyone. Would give it no stars if I could.	-1
Very poorly made product. Mine arrived and the bubble wand was off of the motor and I had to reattach. The battery compartment screw was over tightened and embedded in the plastic and very difficult to remove. The unit leaks bubbles everywhere. In addition this unit is very loud while operating. Very poor quality.	-1
The bubble wand can sometimes fall off of the motor. I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be but if it is its a bad design.	-1
It only lasted a few days. This thing is superbly unstable on it's feet, it rocks and rolls. It vibrates like an airplane while running, hence it won't sit still, even on the pavement. Literally worst bubble machine I've ever owned. I would have returned it but my husband threw it in the trash. Sigh. Save your money.	-1
not good	-1
Great when it works but it doesn't take much to knock this thing over and then spill the bubble solution not only on the ground but also on the motor.  Not sure how many times it will survive that soaking before it just dies.	-1
My son loves bubbles so tried this. Very easy for bubble liquid to spill out and goes through bubbles fast. Will look for something not so easy for kids to tip. Also make your own bubbles, super easy and save on buying the bubbles that come with this. Just Google making bubbles.	-1
Stopped working after a day, had minor scratches proving it was pre used! It just died! After one use of barely 2 minute! But the bubbles are amazing tho! Amazon is sending me a new one , if it works better i might updat my review	-1
Did not come with bubbles, shakes and moves across table.	-1
was broken after using two times	-1
Take 6 baterries, not sturdy	-1
Leaks like crazy. Blows bubbles well.	-1
I put rechargeable batteries in the machine as soon as it arrived. It worked for about 10-15 minutes and then it started to blow one bubble at a time. I took the batteries out and charged them but the problem continued so I went and bought brand new batteries and it still didn't fix the problem. Thankfully Amazon refunded my money but I would not recommend wasting your time with this product.	-1
tips over any time anyone touches it. leaks	-1
We had to return the first one because the on/off switch broke after the first use. We now have the second one and used it maybe 6-7 times and the on/off switch is getting stuck. I have a feeling it will break very soon. We will not be buying another one.	-1
This broke after the first use. This is our fourth bubble machine. They apparently are just not made to last?	-1
This was amazing when it worked, but broke before the end of the season :(	-1
Awful...it rusted and the on/off button broke within days of using it.  We maybe had it on 3 times if we were lucky.  Absolute junk...don't waste your money.	-1
This thing was so much fun... the 2 times we got it to work. We can't figure out what happened but after only a couple uses it now only spits out a few bubbles occasionally	-1
While this machine does blow out a gazillion bubbles, it also falls over and spills out all the bubble solution at the slightest touch. And it leaks!	-1
When this works, it's awesome! So many bubbles that will make your child smile. However, this, just like the two Fubbles no spill bubble machines we bought(which are also wastes of money) will last about 2 weeks before it stops working. Don't bother with this machine.	-1
Worked for like a month or two, then crapped out.  It did make lots and lots of bubbles so we enjoyed it for a short time	-1
Came in,  didn't blow bubbles,  fell apart.	-1
This thing is total junk made in China. Clogs and breaks easily. The only bubbles that work well are the Gazillion brand. However, my children adore the "bubble monster" and when it works, it is super fun for backyard play.	-1
Broke after one use. Waste of money.	-1
Do not buy this!!! Just don't!!! 1. the battery cover is a pain 2. The thing leaks all over the place 3. It is loud. 4. The switch is IMPOSSIBLE to turn off and on 5. The switch will break making it useless.  I am on the search for a replacement but have yet to find one.  DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!!!!	-1
I mean, this is my second one. They just always break.	-1
Broke after one use.	-1
It produced a lot of bubbles, but it vibrated so much that it moved itself right off the table.  After that incident, it stopped working.	-1
Broke one time just	-1
Broke after a little while, but the kids loved it while it worked.	-1
Broke after only a few uses.	-1
It worked for 10 minutes, then never again. So disappointing. It was a gift for my niece.  Updated a year later:  The one for my niece never worked. My daughter received one for her birthday about a month ago. It worked amazingly well, but only twice. It worked amazingly at the party, when they gave it to her. We used it one other time, and it worked pretty well. The third use we got a few bubbles, but it died shortly thereafter.  It takes a large number of batteries, which is fine, if it kept working. The casing around the on/off switch is pretty rusted out, although we were careful to keep it out of the rain/water.  So, still one star. It's really too bad, because that first use was spectacular!	-1
Not happy at talllll .. .. .. My grandsons only had the chance to play with this a few times before it froze up on us. It was very nice while it lasted  which was hardly at all.  Of course the time expired to be able to replace it. Hoping another better company makes something similar.	-1
Fluid capacity is tiny, only lasts for about 15 minutes. Refill is through the little cup on the side. If the on-off switch (on the back of the machine) gets wet, it rusts out and breaks off. It's a fun little toy, but don't expect it to survive use by kids, or last very long. Consider it a party toy for one party.	-1
I bought this for my youngest son when he was 19 months old..he is now 23 months and still won't bother with this slow toy.	-1
Like other reviews, I used this machine once and it quit working. I followed all the instructions to a T and replaced the batteries and nothing. Was great the one time we got to use it, but that was a pretty expensive half hour of fun.	-1
I was looking forward to receiving this in the mail.  My toddler had just found the wonderful world of bubbles.  Our neighbor has a bubble machine (not this one) and it's amazing and he loves it so much, that I immediately came on Amazon and bought this one.  I was nervous about buying it because it didn't have the most stellar of reviews... But I rarely go by other reviews only.  I decided to chance it.  I am now regretting that.  :(  After surprising him with this bubble machine, we immediately started it up.  It was amazing, wonderful, he was in heaven!  For 5 minutes.....  Then the bubbles stopped.  I checked it and it was out of bubble liquid.  So I refilled it..... and it again, ran out very quickly.  It is leaking from the bottom.  Completely useless.  :(  We are heartbroken.  Now I'm in search of a new one.	-1
I bought this bubble machine as a birthday gift for my Grandson. It was such a cute gift and worked for about two months (approximately 20 uses) and just quit working. My son said it looked like the power switch "RUSTED".  I can't imagine them putting in a power switch that will rust on a toy that requires "water" to make it work.  Cheap and not worth purchasing.	-1
Took it out of the box for the first time the day of my daughter's under the sea birthday party....Worked great for the party (thank god) but the next day my kids wanted to play with it... Wouldn't turn on... Never was able to get it to work again.	-1
DOA.  Never worked :-(	-1
There aren't too many options when it comes to battery operated bubble making machines. This one works just ok. Makes a lots of 'clicking' noise and the bubble wheel does get stuck quite often ie does not rotate around the axle smoothly. Also, the bubble wheel is not long enough to reach the bottom of the liquid soap tray thus some of the liquid soap is always wasted at the end.	-1
We used it twice before it died ...	-1
My husband bought one of these for our 1-year-old and put it on during our son's bathtime. Our son loved it! He laughed, he tried to grab at the bubbles, we all had a great time.  Night 2, it stopped working halfway through the bath. My husband changed the batteries... nope. Cleaned it out, no. Broken. We returned it to the store and got a second one...  The second one lasted about a week, which is certainly better than a day. I just returned that one for our money back and since my husband and son were both crazy about bubbles during bathtime, I bought a different brand's bubble machine.  5 brands later, I can tell you that none of these inexpensive bubble machines work for more than a few days! So, it's not just this one. In the end we got a regular old bottle of bubbles with the old-fashioned wand. Human powered and after several months, it's still working! ;)  One positive though is that this brand does make the best quality bubble mix! We have the big tub of Gazillion Bubbles Mix now and use that to blow bubbles.	-1
Leaked bubble solution when it worked but was fun for the kids. Used it for 2 hours at an outdoor birthday party then it didn't work (even with new batteries) when I tried to use it a week later	-1
It used up all the batteries within 15 minutes. I used energezier batteries.	-1
Greatest thing ever...for 10 days. Heed the warnings that it breaks within days of use. Maybe if no kid touched it and it stayed atop a table and spewed joyous bubbles it would last forever but alas, no. Kids are drawn to this thing like bees to honey. Guess why! Because it's a child's bubble machine. They shake it and drop it and get liquid all in the motor. So you think you'll outwit us all and put it up high where no one can get it, well think again because it will vibrate off most surfaces and you guessed it...fall, be shaken and get liquid in the motor.	-1
This machine was great for the whole 3 days it worked. Now it is just another disappointing piece of garbage. Don't waste your money.	-1
Fun while it lasts which is not long. We had our 3 to 4 weeks and kept it in the garage when not used. Just quite working. I paid $20ish from toys r us and its cheaper here but still not for 3 weeks of fun.	-1
This is a fun toy but it didn't last long. The switch pushed in and stopped moving so we were unable to turn the machine on and off. My two year old loved it while it worked.	-1
Despite purchasing 2 of these units and having 2 replacements they kept arriving broken.  We really wanted to love and use it.	-1
Makes lots of bubbles. Shimmies on surface when turned on. Small reservior for bubbles. Would not purchase again.	-1
The bubble display is great and my child is enraptured when it is on. However, this goes through batteries so inefficiently is that I no longer use it. We're not talking about two or three at a time but six. And when the batteries runs low, it barely works. For this reason I cannot recommend it.	-1
Great while it lasted. Then it just died. Took it apart, put it back together again. No luck. Got a couple solid hours of amazing use. But 3/4 time we tried to use it, it was done. I did take the time to open and clean it out after use with warm water. Might now have taken apart every piece, but was pretty good about making sure no soap was in the rotating parts. Not sure if it needed more maintenance, but 3 minutes post-playtime was all I had with my little one.	-1
This machine works great a few times and inevitably konks out. We have had two....the first one lasted a few months with minimal use and the second lasted less than a month and was used approx 5 times (maybe 20 min each). This was a DUD!	-1
we've gone through a few of these. Don't leave outside in the rain. The newest version we purchase they changed the design of the little legs, now when on it moves all over the place, slipping. Love it, just wish it was crafted better.	-1
Broke the first day at my son's birthday party	-1
Poor quality. Broken after 1 use. Motor won't even switch on. Better to buy something else	-1
I opened it. I put the 6 batteries (no less) it needs. We turned it on. My one-year old boy was loving it.... And it stopped working. I thought "wow, 6 batteries only last 10 minutes?!" Next day I tried again, in case the motor overheated or something, but it wouldnt work. My husband then changed the batteries. It does NoT work!! IT BROKE AFTER 10 MINUTES OF OPERATION.	-1
Found it cheaper at Walmart after I ordered it, it jammed up after first use and tips over easily.  Not a great investment.	-1
I bought this because my two year old loves bubbles.  Although the product completely delighted him the first time we used it, unfortunately it only worked for about a week, even though it was always used under the supervision of an adult.  It required six batteries, which seems excessive for a machine of this size.  It also doesn't work well unless you use the Gazillion bubbles liquid - we tried other liquids with significantly less success.  We ended up buying a different brand, that will last longer that 4 uses and 1 week.	-1
I use this machine one time - for just a few minutes to test it out - and it worked. The next time I used it (just a day later) the switch broke off and the motor quit working. Very disappointing. DO NOT buy this bubble machine.	-1
Broke after a few uses.	-1
Out of the box this little buble machine is great, tons of bibles.  However the switch goes bad once it gets wet. This product toppled easily, and it's very easy to get liquid on it! Ordered the first one great  first and second time of use. The second one arrived replaced at no charge and the same thing happened. Do not recommend!	-1
We only got one use out of it then it broke.	-1
It's cheap and you get what you pay for.  While working it produces a ton of small bubbles but the quality is horrible.  Only thing keeping it from 1 star is it was only $10 when I purchased.  Seems like the quality has gone down because friends of ours had one that worked for several years, mine only worked for 20 minutes and the it stopped!!	-1
Not worth the money.  Takes a lot of batteries - they are hard to put in.  The bubble mechanism does not stay put well.	-1
