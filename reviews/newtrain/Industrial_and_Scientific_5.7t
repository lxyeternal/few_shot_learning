as expected.my go to meter	1
It's no Fluke, but it gets the job done. I especially like the DC Amps clamp-on function which I use for my EDF RC Jets and Helicopters. I keep this in my RC field bag.	1
I have only used this clamp on a couple of times. Very small footprint but works just fine. I am impressed as it looks like a very quality clamp on AC - DC meter. I have other clamp on that I use on my AC but never had a DC clamp on before and this works just Great.  Defaults to AC Amps when you first turn it on but just press a button and you are ready to measure DC current.	1
works great	1
Great little product. Works well.	1
High quality and works great	1
Very tiny, but accurate description.  It just looks a lot bigger in the picture.  Works well with Arduino and NodeMCU.	1
outstanding deal on an SSD1306 OLED - works with Arduino, Beaglebones, Raspberry Pis - even a Zero!  this is a great way to have a low-power, readable display on one of these fun little micro-controllers or SBCs  use rm-hull's Python lib and code (search GitHub)... after you do an install, here's a little routine to wrap a long line of text output (i use it on my Beaglebone, but it also works as-is on my RPi3):  # display uptime stats with text wrap  def get_uptime():   uptime = os.popen("uptime")   ut = str(uptime.read())   # strip out trailing chars for cleaner output   return "%s" % ut.rstrip('\r\n')   font = ImageFont.truetype('/home/debian/Downloads/ssd1306-master/FreeSans.ttf', 17)  draw.text((1, 1),  '  UPTIME',  font=font, fill=1)   # now smaller font needed and wrap text to show info  font = ImageFont.truetype('/home/debian/Downloads/ssd1306-master/FreeSans.ttf', 11)  import textwrap  lines = textwrap.wrap(get_uptime(), width=25)  # what 'line' to start info  y_text = 20  w = 1 # we'll always start at left side of OLED  for line in lines:   width, height = font.getsize(line)   draw.text((w, y_text), line, font=font, fill=1)   y_text += height   oled.display()  sleep(4)  oled.cls()  enjoy your display!	1
Got it working in 5 minutes with the Adafruit drivers, bright little display!	1
Once I located the proper drivers, documentation and programming examples, I successfully connected the OLED Display to my Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I use the OLED to display temperature and ventilation fan speed in my Entertainment Center Cabinet. At my age I should probably purchased a larger unit to see temperatures from across the room, however this works very well. Purchased another to "play" with in development projects/programming. Low power, very bright and once the learning curve is tackled, easy to include in programming projects requiring display.	1
If you haven't OLED'd yet, get to it. This and several similar types are way better then standard LCD or LED. Very bright.	1
I'm not sure who is in charge of QA/QC for DIYmall, but they need to go back to school and relearn proper ESD procedures. You can't use standard white Styrofoam to put ESD sensitive pins into as it creates tons of static electricity. It's a wonder these displays work when received given the way they are packaged. This is a continuing problem for items ordered from DIYmall and they need to address it.	-1
As William stated the address is 0x3C and indeed the thing will appear dead unless it is correctly set.  display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C);  This is in the rar listing which is just the Adafruit example.  It does work fine.  Taking off one star as they really could clean up that doc a bit.	1
Good product. Satisfied.	1
I love these tiny displays. They do consume a fair amount of I2C bus traffic however. If you have critical timing loops..you should consider this fact	1
Super clear display, easy to set up, great price.	1
This little display is great - it is half the price of the Adafruit version and does not have a multitude of wires. The display works with the Adafruit_SSD1306 Arduino library. For those unfamiliar with that library, be sure to open the .h file, look for line 54-56 which will have a few lines of #define's. Simply leave the one that has 128x64 uncommented and comment out the other display sizes. There is a jumper on the back of this display to let you select the I2C address. Mine said it was 0x78 but was actually 0x3C (the Adafruit library is set to 0x3D by default). Also, the listing says this board is 3 to 5 volts, but I know the Adafruit ones are either 3 or 5 volt. Since this board probably isn't as well built, I decided to run it only on 3.3 volts straight off my Arduino. And I also should mention the upper ~20-25% of this display is yellow and the lower section is a teal blue - it isn't a dual color display where every pixel's color is selectable.	1
Fast Shipping, everything as described on product page.  Good Quality.	1
Great screen, but be aware that library support for the dual colors is minimal so far. It should catch up over time, but unless you want to bit-bang this thing to get what you need, you'll be stuck with a portion of the screen that's yellow.	1
This is a great little screen. I have it mounted to a small arduino beetle. It shows me the current temperature inside my 3d printer enclosure. The beetle then controls a fan to keep the temps stable. I have multiple set temps for the different filament types and the screen displays which filament it is set to.  As others mentioned, the colors are not user controllable. The top line is yellow and the rest is blue. There is a slight horizontal black bar between the two colors.	1
Great small display for Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and PIC projects. I2C interface makes using this simple regardless of platform The display colors are nice and both text & graphics are very readable despite the tiny size.	1
Fun little, and I do mean 'little', display. Ideal for when I need a little bit of text and or graphics in a small space.	1
Great.....works FINE	1
Works great, tried both ADAFRUIT and U8g2 lib  Well at first the Adafruit SSD1603 did not seem to do anything as i used the 0x78 address (the one printed on the back). Once switched back to 0x3C the example worked perfect.  The funny thing is since the AdaFruit lib did not seem to work i decided to try U8g2 lib which did not have an obvious place to define the address.  Anyways, stick to 0x3C and you're fine (I had to make a change in the Adafruit "h" file to define the proper display type, but then it loaded and worked immediately, graphics demo and all.  Remember this is a monochrome display with 2 color zones (yellow top and blue bottom, those colors are fixed).	1
Works well with an arduino using the Adafruit_GFX_Library and the Adafruit_SSD1306 library. No pixel issues and it's breadboard friendly.	1
This is an awesome little display I have been running this tiny screen on an experimental project for several months now and it's still going strong!  Be careful when mounting though! I used slightly larger screws and the screw heads scraped the top edge the display adjoining the mounting holes cracking it instantly. I lost an entire top-line display as a result of this damage. Despite the damage, the rest of the display continues to perform without any glitches!  But this isn't a flaw in the product. However, I wish there was some recommendation on what the size screws can be safely used to mount this display instead of me having mix and match screws from my parts bin.  I'm not sure if I have looked properly, but does this come in 128 x 64 resolution for the same display colors?  I could really use the extra pixels.	1
If you hook these up wrong for one second, they will burn out.	-1
Great item for a small work project.  Did what it was supposed to do and as a beginner I was able to program it with the right libraries installed.  Can't beat the price for such a useful display.	1
I love these units because of the yellow border on the top--makes for a good heading. I have bought 6 or so and will probably buy more.  Use the #include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h> for very fast performance (I made a 4khz oscilloscope), or use #include "SSD1306Ascii.h" for nice fonts and very low memory consumption.	1
nice screen and only two wires are needed from the arduino board. I2C bus is the best!	1
Good Buy	1
With its crystal clear display and easy I2C connection, this little OLED  went easily  into my project and looks terrific.  The link provided to the library worked well.  It is I2C address 0x3C, so don't get confused by the markings on the back of the board.  I did, but used an I2C scanner and sure as heck, their docs were correct!  Adafruit's library is what makes this great, and making bitmaps for images is very easy using the tool at: [...]f you are using it for Arduino (or Particle Photon, as I am in this project).  I bought one to see how it would look for my project and it is going into 7 more that I am making; I just bought 8 more.  Seller shipped fast and it arrived in a nice padded envelope, perfectly packed for the journey.	1
Great little screen! Requires special software reset code, so generic drivers don't work if they're for boards with more pins that have a hardware reset.  If you're writing your own driver, or want to use a specific driver, you can copy this part of the code from the drivers linked. That's what I did and it is working great!	1
High quality and delivered on time.	1
Having a lot of fun with this on my Raspberry Pi 2. Using it to display the status of my home made egg incubator.	1
Fantastic Screen and very sharp and bright. It's compatible with Arduino UNO. It uses the I2C bus. The CORRECT I2C ADDRESS is NOT 0x78 as marked on the board's silkscreen (see picture) but 0x3C. The Adafruit_SSD1306.h header file has it correct under SSD1306_I2C_ADDRESS as 0x3C though so you can substitute the 0x3B in the "ssd1306_128x64_i2c.ino" sample program with "SSD1306_I2C_ADDRESS" and it works. The other thing is you need to uncomment the "//#define SSD1306_128_64" line and comment the other two so it know what screen size is. The wires used are from this product link:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Kalevel-120pcs-Multicolored-40pin-Male-to-Female-40pin-Male-to-Male-40pin-Female-to-Female-Breadboard-Jumper-Wires-Ribbon-Cables-Kit/dp/B00M5WLZDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Kalevel 120pcs Multicolored 40pin Male to Female, 40pin Male to Male, 40pin Female to Female Breadboard Jumper Wires Ribbon Cables Kit</a>	1
Got it working in 5 minutes using the link provided in the description, method #2 (using pins A4, A5)	1
excellent little display... using rm-hull/ssd1306 instructions at git-hub i was up and running with this display in less than 10 minutes... as a bonus, the code ports easily to the Beaglebone (i use a Green Wireless)  and this little display will be a perfect companion to my new Pi Zero! it can also be used as a nice system monitor for a headless ARM SBC!  it took just a single afternoon of hacking with some Python code to craft a nice little output for this display - will be quite handy! (i've attached a couple pics)  extremely sharp and bright lettering - just be aware that is a *tiny* display (which is good for a number of reasons: low power draw, inexpensive, fits on small cases)	1
Originally purchased to use with an Arduino project (which worked perfectly), but then repurposed it and am using it as a screen on my 250 racing quad. Works right out of the box with the SP Racing F3 Flight Controller. Good build quality and clear screen with easy readability.	1
Great product, the OLED is super clear and sharp, I will certainly purchase more of these for my projects. The item was packaged well, and shipped fast as always. GREAT TRANSACTION!!!	1
The display is bright and crisp. I like the yellow band at top: It really accentuates the status text that I put there. Easy enough to get it up and running.	1
Works as expected but be aware that the libraries and global variables required for this to work will eat up most of the memory of an Arduino UNO R3. I cannot think of many (if any) useful projects that need a small screen like this and can run on the Arduino UNO R3 after this display takes up most of the variables usable memory. Would be great for a Netduino or a Mega I guess.  I did use several of these to make temperature monitors for our server rooms at work using Raspberry PIs. They worked well for a while but I noticed that the screens get burned images of the temperature they display after a few months of constant operation. If you are going to use this, you may want to turn off the video and provide a button to turn it back on temporarily otherwise they will go bad and the burned image is so strong that you have hard time reading what ever it is actually trying to display at the time.	1
being a complete newb at this, still got it working on a brand new arduino/genuino 101 (took a little 3 hr class on how to get the galileo to run a bit ago, so had a smidgeon of experience).    First thing I tried after the blink check (make sure your USB is plugged in all the way...took about an hour to figure that one out :-p) was to get the 128x64 I2C example to run. key things to get the example to run:   grab the 1306 and GFX libraries from adafruit/github    1306.h - change the comment out for the 128x32 display to  128x64 (was in lines 62/63 for me)   the I2C address was set for the 128x32 to 0x3C...left that as is as this is what we need for this display. got a ton of compile errors...quick google search let to this:   1306.ccp - comment out delay.h ( // #include <util/delay.h>) in line 28 - check for delay_ms and replace with plain delay (I didn't have that actually being used, all were already converted in the .ccp file, looks like the include was a carryover/update miss?)  --> compiled fine after this and the example code uploaded and runs.  hookup: connected SDA/SCL/GND to same named pins on board, vcc to 3.3V pin	1
Had not realized that by "yellow and blue" they basically meant that the first line is yellow and everything else blue... but cool nonetheless :)	1

It can be used from any device (MCU/CPU, Development/Hobbyist/Evaluation board) that exposes an I2C bus as master device. The only requirement is to comply with the I2C spec regarding electrical levels, timing and the protocol itself.  I'm connecting the display from PIC16Fxxx and PIC18Fxxx uC's for all of the acquired parameters from perimetric sensors that I need to analize.  This device exposes two possible I2C slave addresses these are "b0111100" or "b0111101" selected through the SA0 pin which comes wired from factory by the SMD jumper located at the back below the label "Address" (0x78).  Take into account that 0x78 isn't the real I2C address, this is the WHOLE I2C address since this device is just for output and there is no logical operation implying reading on it, so the 0x78 is the 0x3C (which is the raw I2C address) shifted left 1 bit adding the I2C write bit which is "0", so it becomes 0x78. Know that an I2C master device must initiate the communication with an slave device by sending first the following frame:  Sb # 7 bit slave address # R/W bit # Ack  (# are just separators)  Sb: start bit (SDA line pulled down while keeping SCK high)  7 bit slave address: which is 0x3C for the display  R/W bit : which is "0" for a write operation (0x3C becomes 0x78)  Ack bit only if there is an slave device identified by the address (replied by the slave)  I couldn't load the entire font array since it requires about 8K of storage, so I decided to burn the whole array into an external EEPROM to get access to the whole bunch of ASCII fonts mapped on the LUT.  Memory is addressed (by default) through PAGES and SECTORS (8 pages and 127 sectors). Columns and Rows can be re-mapped to alter the scrolling and writing direction.  It requires "Command" frames and "Data" frames to get access to its registers and to the GDDRAM. If you check the documentation regarding I2C you'll find that commands are posted by sending first a null byte (0x00) and Data requires the 0x40 marquer right after the I2C address. This is because of the Co and D/C# bits. Lot more to talk about on technical features!  Totally recommended!	1
This thing is fun! Only problem is, because i2c is a bit slow, you can kinda see the refresh. It is rated at 400khz. There is no programmable refresh rate or delay, it immediately updates the corresponding pixels when they are sent over the i2c bus, so there is no way to send the next frame to it while it's displaying the entire old frame.	1
This would of been a 4-5 star review, had it not arrived with the pins stuck into normal white styrofoam. That stuff creates it's own static, so it takes a real brain child to use it to terminate electrostatic sensitive devices into it. Amazingly enough, the display did work fine, which is why this isn't a 1 star review. The company needs to instruct their workers on the proper anti-static procedures and materials.	-1
Pretty good inexpensive little screen. Please be aware this is NOT a dual color display, its really a thin yellow LCD on top of a blue LCD. Not much documentation but adafruit has libraries for it.	1
Mine was delivered non-functional	-1
Fun fun fun in only 4 wires.	1
NICE LITTLE DISPLAY	1
There are no reviews of this machine and the reviews for other scanners were mixed.  I decided to buy one from Amazon, try it and if it didn't work, return it.  It works!  I'm only giving it 4 starts because I don't know anything about this stuff.  Long story below.  Got interested in 3D printing and I have been researching printers for the past year or so.  I notice that they seem to keep getting better and cheaper.  I have not bought one because I can't figure out what I would do with it.  Also - don't know how hard it will be to create 3D images.  So I downloaded a copy of Google Sketchup.  Watched all 4 of  their training videos on a wide screen so I could replicate what they were demonstrating on the actual software.  I can now make a cube with a pole sticking out of it.  Then I got curious about scanners and decided to try this one.  It came in two days.  Everything was well packed and it was very easy to connect.  Instructions to set up and use are very, very simple.  My first scan was a disaster because I did not calibrate the system.  Also it took about 4 hours.  I have been using SketchUp on my firm issued laptop, but after this problem I connected the scanner to a much better PC out in the man-cave.  I put a little basket about 2" tall on the scanner, scanned it.  Then I laid it on its side and scanned it again.  I used the software that comes with the scanner to 'clean' the images, then combined them.  Then I used their software to 'output as an "STL" file".  Then I did something to  SketchUp that enables it to import STL files.  I had it import the basket. STL file from the scanner.  It took about 40 minutes (I'm back on the lap top - don't ask why).  When it got finished a very dense image is in SketchUp.  I'll try to add some pictures.  Some things you should know:  1) there are no real instructions.  Go to Matterandform.net and click on HELP.  That's all the instructions.  Their software lets you do 'advanced settings' but they are baffling.  One document that comes with the unit says there is NO Warranty.  Period.  It says this in about 10 languages.  Be sure to buy from Amazon.  I tried several different scans and it seems to work the best when there is a LOT of ambient light.	1
Got this scanner with some preconceptions of how it was supposed to work. When I first set it up and played around with it, my results were very lack luster. I sat up a call with the company to do a free training session. Got some great tips and my last few scans have been much much better. If you have a model with a lot of definition and intricate parts, it may not get them all. But some work will get you something very close to the object at hand. Plan on working some more with this and see what I can get done	1
The Scanner works well.  The software could use a little work, but it will get the job done.  If you are looking for dimensionally accurate scans learn CAD.  If you need to scan an object like a model, small object, and it does not have to be critically accurate..this scanner will do a fine job.  I can say this about it...make sure the object you are trying to scan fits on the black disc....yes you can have stuff hang over the edge...but smaller objects work best.  Be prepared to dust your object of any reflective surfaces....reflective surfaces prohibit good scanning.  Overall this is a great little scanner....the price is right.  Plan on doing post-processing work on the objects you scan it's kinda just part of the scanning process.  I am hoping Matter & Form will update the scanning software for this scanner.  Hope this information helps you.	1
kind of works but is not very  rough scans....do not expect any help from the technical support. Yes they do contact but it takes for ever to get an answer. Even so i send them pictures...logs.....and scan files they hardly gave me technical information on what to do...you are on your own.	-1
Horrible product arrived broken replacement was broken also I would look elsewhere you might get a good one but then again you might get two bad ones like I did not worth the hassle	-1
The scanner works well if you scan items that are not reflective or have a lot of areas not visible to the camera and laser. Lighting is the key to using the scanner. I placed two white led strips on the sides behind the camera, and I had no problems with setup or scans. Only noise it makes is when the camera is raised or lowered. Scanning will take time, and doesn't always look the best before clean up. I would have gave 5 stars if they would have included a lighting system on the scanner.	1
Bought this scanner to scan items for my business.  So far it has worked very well.  I found that by using the Advanced scanning feature of the software it was possible to increase the scan quality.  Using the combine feature of the software also helped build very robust point clouds that made for very usable STL files for 3D printing.  Great product and great customer support in the form of videoconference product tutorials.  Great little scanner for the price.  Would buy again.	1
Needed the absolute best lighting and contrast to complete an OK scan. If there is any shine on a object or it is black, it has a very hard time catching anything. Very cheap looking and makes a lot of noise. Hope they design it better in the future. Not worth the money.	-1
I went into purchasing a 3D scanner with low expectations. I have a 3d printer, and I know the struggles that go into get these bleeding edge stuff to work. I am thoroughly impressed how well this device works. These guys really know their stuff. Don't expect to drop a figure press a button and get a 3d model, it takes time, much like 3d printing, 3d scanning is slow. It's not as slow, but is slow. Multi color objects require double the time of single color objects. The software in automatic mode does a very good job of figuring out the amount of rotation needed. What I am really impressed with is the fact that you scan something once on one angle, save it. Then reposition the object, scan it again, and merge the 2 scans, and it fills in the missing bits which were obscured from the first angle. That works perfectly. I made a model out of sculpey, scanned in 5 different angles (each angle taking about 30 minutes), created a 3d model --- did some cleanup in other programs, and printed it -- all in one 24 hour period. That is truly remarkable/	1
This is a great portable scanner! There are limits to what you can do with a laser turntable scanner - the object has to fit into the turntable, and cannot be too shiny, for example. But within that, this scanner is fantastic!	1
Great little scanner. This has really exceeded my expectations. I am a high school science teacher and use the scanner in biology to scan fossils and other specimens. Students use it in physics to assist in prototyping materials that they will 3d print. I have only had to contact tech assist once and they answered pronto then followed up to see how things were going. Expect to take some time to tinker and try different lighting and settings. I have been able to get some great scans transferred to .stl files for my 3D printer.	1
I bought the unit used on ebay, it had some damage.  They got me my missing parts, and followed up with me to make sure it was all working ok.  Support might be a bit slow, but If you give them a chance they will contact you directly and follow up..  Wes in San Francisco	1
well built scanner and the best customer service i have ever seen. thanks matter and form!!!	1
Well, it does work. First of all, the thing feels very much like a dime store toy. Now, please, don't let that be overly derogatory in forming your opinion. It is actually very well designed. someone put a great deal of thought into it. But, the plastic housing, and the light weight put me off.  It folds up like a little 'Barbie Doll" carrying case that folds out into a dolls dressing room or something. But, in the folded state, it takes  up very little room and is very well protected. Performance....It was very difficult to get the driver to load and be recognized. The hunt for the driver was about an hours worth of frustration that really should not be an issue at all. I am working on a Windows 7 and had to up grade to a Windows 8 Lap top just for this machine...it worked fine, so, it may have been a Windows issues...which has not been uncommon. Expect the scans to take quite a while. The M&F instructions and tutorials are full of this advice.  Scans take up huge amounts of computer memory. So, the best advice I can give is use a dedicated computer strictly for scanner use. Set your target on the turntable and let it do it's thing...You will need to take several scans of the same object to get a really good scan that can be reliably printed...but, I understand, this is true for most scanners of this caliber. The scanner should come with a little stemmed stage (like a wine glass, only a half inch tall. If you do not have one, print one. It is very hard to separate the bottom of your object from the stage that scans with it...so, a little table or single post stage is what I use to solve that problem. Lighting is critical. You really need some sort of flat but fairly bright lighting scheme to help illuminate your targets. I fount that battery powered "stick-up" lights work great. Build a little light "Tree" that can light up your targets from right and left and above.  I think I paid 12 bucks for three of these lights and they made a huge difference in my scans. They do not flicker, and have great flat light spread. You have to (must!) calibrate the scanner before every scan. I don't know why, but, this give better, perfectly scaled scans. Calibration is super easy, but takes a little time.  Overall, once you get the darned thing set up and actually working, it is ok. The software you down load to go with it is made for people I call "Cadillac drivers" who want to just push the pedal and go. But, it is rather odd...very few options you can tinker with..so, in a way that's good. But, it is confusing at first and seems again, more like a "Play School" video game than a real craftsmanship tool.  Clearly, the M&F people were trying to make a scanner for everyone. It is fine for some people less experienced working with 3-D and computer digital modeling. If they ever get their driver to be more workable with Windows it should be fine (in research, I found that the Mac folks do not seem to have any issue with the driver and also, I understand, Macs works very well with this little scanner! A point to ponder) .  Final lines: It's an okay scanner. It's probably a bit over priced (In my opinion), but it is well thought out and does scan objects well if you work with it and give it lots of time to get the job done. I would love to have a better software to use with it and yet, for the price, the software does work.  And, it is well protected, so you are not likely to "tweak" it to a point of making it totally screwed up. Put your objects on that little table,and you will be in the 3D scanning world.	1
Works well	1
Works great. We use them or trash pickup on or roads by the house.	1
Life saver for my dad.  He's able to pick things up with ease - when and if he can find the remote when it's dropped, at least he has the tool to "grab it" !!	1
Works perfectly but the suction cups come off easily but are easily put back on-Mess up the threads to secure them better	1
Great product at best price. Thank you.	1
Easy to use, came in very handy while unable to bend over.	1
It's a stretch, but it grabs and holds well, in awkward situations	1
This long-handled, aluminum grabbing tool provides good reach. The suction cups are mounted on semi-flexible pincer arms, which do a reasonable job of grasping and holding, even on oddly shaped items like a large light-bulb.  I ordered this grabber for a very specific purpose: to extend my reach to deal with an otherwise dangerously high-up recessed light. So my use-case was removing an R30 reflector bulb without dropping it (especially since the old one was CFL!) and installing a new LED R30, also preferably without dropping it.  The grabber provided sufficient tension so the business end had leverage to unscrew the bulb. That's where the awkward part started, where I had to maintain the level of tension on the trigger while rotating the grabber several times (eg, alternating hands). That clumsiness was even more so with the new bulb, since it was heavier, and had to be lined up more precisely to screw into the socket.  If there had been a trigger-locking mechanism, once the grabber was positioned just so, I could have locked it down and concentrated on just turning / placing the bulb. Another concern is the lifetime of those rubber cups, which may not hold up very well if the grabber is used frequently for some of the suggested tasks (like picking up trash). Those quibbles drop my rating by a star, but the tool worked for the purpose I needed it to, and thus is Recommended.	1
This thing pinches my finger every time I use it. It doesnt hold the weight stated either. I found another grabber I like much better.	-1
This is my favorite grabber.  Its suction cups make it possible for the grabber to pick up small, thin objects, even q-tips. Its handle fits my hand.  A good product.	1
Picks up very small items	1
this suction cup grip works just fine. I have a bad back and it is hard for me to bind over and pickup things off the floor	1
This grabber actually works quite well and it is so much more convenient than having to get out a step stool.	1
This grabber by VIVE Health  is well made and light weight.  So why don't I like it?  To start, I didn't think about how much use I would have for it before I made the purchase.  All my higher up things are too big for me to bring them down with any grabber.  The only use I can find to use it right away is the ceiling lights in my kitchenette.  They are of the modern little non-tungsten bulbs of an odd shape.  Alas, the grabber couldn't get a hold on them.  I'm keeping the grabber anyway.  Some day I might need it.	-1
Surprisingly, we use this one for weeding in the flower and vegetable beds. The suction cups easily grab hold of the weed and a quick flick of the wrist and they're pulled out roots and all. Great for saving the back and the knees.	1
Truly awful.  The suction cups are worthless and it is hugely cumbersome.	-1
much better than the cheap ones that the slide lock jams on and folder joint breaks.	1
This thing works great!  I bought for my mother in law for general use pre and post hip replacement.  SHE LOVES!	1
Very high quality. Strong grabber.	1
It works just fine.	1
Being about ready to deliver makes reaching things that fall in the floor extremely difficult. So difficult that half the time I just leave whatever fell down there because it is too much trouble to pick it up. With the reacher grabber, that problem has been rectified. I have even used this to get clothes out of the dryer. While you can't pick up things that are extremely heavy (it says 5 pounds in the technical specs), it works great for picking up trash, a water bottle out of reach, or even laundry.	1
Did not notice these had suction cups on the end. Why would you want them? Turns out it is a very clever idea. The cups are not used for suction per say. The outer lips will pick up a business card, envelops or one piece of paper off the floor. Items do not slip out and cups conform to item. No problem with bigger articles but that would be rare. After using this I realized it's the little things you drop 95% of the time and this excels.	1
I had previously bought one that bends, which I found bends when I didn't want it to bed. This one is nice and stiff.	1
Vive provided 3 different Reacher Grabber tools free of charge for review. After about a year of regular use this style Reacher Grabber broke :-(  The rubber suction cup hardened then cracked apparently as it fell off.  I tried to repair but was unsuccessful.  I see another brand sells replacement blue SILICONEcups,  I'm going to see if I can use them on the Vive.  If not, then don't expect to get many years of light use from this tool.  I really love it,  I'm holding out hope I find a way to repair this Reacher Grabber tool.	1
bought this for a family member as it was better that the grabber the hospital gave them to take home	1
Excellent value especially with PRIME	1
Superb.	1
I love it hlepful w/ reaching on top shelfs or picking up item on the floor!  From John Bradford	1
Piece of junk, ordered 2 one fell apart in 2 days. NO roughor heavy usage.	-1
Exactly as described.	1
fastest delivery ever! this grabber is everything it says it is, so glad we bought it -- no more having to climb (cant do it any more) to reach the top shelf, pull a light switch (yes, it can even grab one of those thin metal chains and pull it) or change a light bulb. the kids love it, too. am 5 ft. tall, wish I'd have gotten this a long time ago. may get another to use outside for fruit trees and such. very well made. thank you!	1
I was skeptical about the little suction cup ends but they pick up very small pieces on the floor and even helped me unscrew a light bulb that was too high to reach with my step stool. If you don't want to get on your knees or move furniture around to retrieve every little pill and piece of popcorn that falls under a table you need this. Good for pulling down stuff from high shelves too.	1
My problem isn't the product.  I ordered what you see in the picture, the suction cup reacher.  But what I actually received was the claw reacher.  Not the same thing.  I purchased this for picking up stuff while on my lawn mower.  Rocks, sticks, dog toys, kids toys, tennis balls, etc.  After careful consideration assumed the suction cup one would be best that's why I ordered that.  The claw version works OK, but not great.  It's honestly more hassle to send it back than it is to soldier on.  But were I an elderly person expecting to get the suction cup reacher because that what I really needed, well, I might never be able to get that can of peaches off the top shelf.	-1
assisting me after my back surgery & very well. Price was great too. I'm very satisfied.	1
Very well made.  Perfect for my needs which is for daily use in the kitchen with puppies making messes tearing up papers and all that.  This is the second one and I had to search to find this exact one with this handle that is easy to use and does not flip closed in the middle.	1
It does the job, very well!!!	1
I have some mobility issues, as well as being short. This reacher has been working great for helping me get things from shelves and off the floor. It's a good length, and the trigger is easy to operate, plus it's pretty light weight.  The tensioning and suction cups work great for things like remotes, small electronics and other things that are about double fist sized or smaller in diameter. I've been using it more than expected because it does make things so much easier. Review item provided at no cost, this is my honest experience and opinion.	1
This is a pretty solid reaching/grabbing device, great for picking up light weight items from the ground or shelves or elsewhere. The handle grip is comfortable and easy to squeeze and the gripping end holds well with most objects. The suction cup ends are a great idea, since they grab well to rounded items and enable this to be used for reaching light bulbs. This has a good length for many tasks, the only improvement would be to create an adjustable pole so you could have it longer or shorter as needed.	1
As you get older you will rely upon this product. Handy.	1
As someone who has a balance problem I don't normally bend down to pick things up off the floor (I usually let my husband get it).  I thought I was throwing an envelope in the garbage, but instead it ended up on the floor.  I looked at it for a few seconds and then remembered I have some Reacher Grabbers; this one with the suction cups worked the best in grabbing that envelope and throwing it in the garbage, yay!  These also work on getting down items from a top shelf, but they don't work for putting up those same items on a high shelf because they squeeze it and don't want to let it go (the best grabber I found for putting things up on a shelf is the VIVE Rotating Reacher Grabber because it will let go of the object.)  I just used this Suction Cup Reacher Grabber to get things that had been hiding behind the washer and dryer for months.  I found the suction cups work well for picking up smaller objects, but also expand enough to fit around a can or bottle. Here's what I just fished out - a lint brush (good place for it; it was full of lint), a lint roller (ditto), a couple of plastic bags, a bottle of Febreze, a can of foam sealer, and an eyelet kit; (oh yeah, and lots more lint).  Before this I had nothing that would reach back there so whatever fell just stayed there.  I also used this Suction Cup Reacher Grabber to get a dead spider that was hiding in a corner.  It's actually embarrassing all the lint I'm finding with this in places where the vacuum won't go; lol.  At first I wondered why VIVE made three different designs; why would I need different ones?  I'm finding out that each one does something a little different and if one doesn't work, another one will.  If I was going to buy just one I would get the VIVE Suction Cup Reacher Grabber because I personally think it's the most versatile. This is a product I didn't know I needed until I used it; now I don't know what I'd do without it!  Product provided for review.	1
This is a really handy tool to have around. I tried it on a bunch of different things and was able to pick up a lot of things with it. I was able to unscrew a light bulb with it as well, which was really nice. As a disabled person, I don't like climbing up on stuff to change a light bulb, and with this I don't have to.  I was not able to grab anything with too much weight on it though. Not because of the tool, it grabbed it just fine, but because my wrists weren't strong enough to lift it up after grabbing it. This is handy for when the dogs lose their toys and balls under the furniture or the stove as well. I just reach under with this and grab it without having to lift any heavy furniture.  It is light weight aluminum and plastic with a strong nylon string that maneuvers the jaws to close when you pull the trigger on the handle, and a spring on the other side that makes it open again when you release the trigger. I like it, and it helps a lot for things around the house. I'm short, so I either have to climb on chairs a lot, or ask someone else to get something out of the higher cabinets. With this, I can get it myself. Very handy.  This item was sent to me in exchange for an honest review.	1
This particular style of grabber is meant to be used with more delicate jobs like changing light bulbs, Sachets, envelopes, books and Tablets or smart phones.  I was requested by VIVE to test their product and then leave an objective, impartial review.  They must really believe in their product to do that as I could really slam this product if it failed my testing.  Anyway, i proceeded to test it.  This is what I found:  1.  I find that this is really the best at picking up keys, remote controls, watches etc.  But it is the best at picking up golf balls. Just to give you an idea, this is similar to you pinching something with your fingertips.  All the force is concentrated on the small area of the suction cups.  2.  It has more feel than the other styles of grabbers.  3.  The trigger is very easy to squeeze.  SUMMARY: It was really functional.  I could not use it to grab a drinking glass.  The Rotating Reacher is more appropriate for that task.	1
This suction cup reacher grabber is incredibly handy. It easily grabs tissues, candy wrappers people throw out by our yard, little bits of debris over the floor, just works great. It has a nice reach and on the days my knee or back is acting up I can use it without having to bend over, to get my shoes, my socks out of the drawer, just a plethora of handy ways to use it.  sample provided for review	1
VIVE Suction Cup Reacher Grabber is the greatest helper I've got. I have Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis and am either in a scooter or using a walker so it limits memy funky hands that don't do what they're supposed to do, things I'm using fall on the floor. Or I need to get something that fell behind a bookcase or the dresser or wherever and I can't get to it. This Suction Cup Reacher Grabber is what comes in handy. There's drinking glasses or a box of Mac & Cheese I need to get out of or put into the kitchen cupboard I can't reach.  What I really love about the Suction Cup Reacher Grabber is how easy it is to pick up really thin things other reacher grabbers can't grab and hold onto. Things like pencils, pens, markers, and brushes. I'm an artist and having SPMS and dropping my pencil can be a HUGE ordeal. Most reacher grabbers don't close enough to grab those skinny things or you have to try and angle them and attempt to pick them up but, usually you can't. I can even pick up bags, pamphlets and single sheets of paper that fall down.  As long as what you're trying to pick up is light weight, this is a must have helper to add to your arsenal of reacher grabbers.  Plus, my cats love me to gently close it ever so slightly and let it open up and down their backs for a gentle kitty massage. Not for picking up pets though, just for a little kitty love.  I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest review.	1

Bought these before & used them to make up my own battery jumpers for my solar panels.  You can either crimp these or solder them.  I prefer the soldered method.	1
yep	1
Very Good Product...	1
As advertised	1
Works Great!!!!	1
Works Great!!!!	1
perfect	1
perfect	1
really great bargain	1
Perfect, if you need larger hole, put in vice and drill! No need to purchase several different size lugs for different screw terminals...	1
I only need a few of these but they are well built, so I'll hang on to them	1
I built a spool gun set up using 2AWG welding cable and these worked great with my hydraulic crimper. Very tight and solid.	1
Worked great	1
Worked great	1
work very well perfect for ground cables.	1
Used these to make replacement cables for my golf cart and they worked great.	1
Excellent product for brewing.  I did not want to have 2 pumps so I use it to recirculate and then switch it over to fill the boil kettle.  Works like a charm without having to incorporate another pump and the expense.	1
Great product, fast service, great price.	1
This valve is fine but make sure you understand that 3 way valve does not mean that it has three directions. There are two types- L and T. This is L type which will only go between two of the three ports at any time not straight through. The T type can go straight through and to the side.	1
I have two of these now and ordering a third. Good price and works well. I change the handle orientation so that direction of flow is aligned with the handles. It comes that way, but sometimes we mount where the original handle direction won't fit. DO NOT use this on a system with pressure as it is possible to make a mistake and shut off flow and if pressure continues to build that is not good. If you want to use as a shut off valve use on no pressure system (pressure does not continue to build).	1
As described	1
Very fast delivery time and extremely well packaged!  All slides arrived without and damage!  These are some of the best type of slides for use of viewing specimens or samples not requiring cover slips.  Cost comparison shopping, these are the best for the money to be found!  Very well made!  I'll be buying from this seller again...Soon!  Thanks!	1
Love these concave slides!	1
I love these slides, I always wanted to have some like this but every time I found them they were too expensive, I got a great deal and Im very happy with them!	1
The library is extremely easy to use. Humidity and temperature in a single sensor is nice. As accurate as you'll find for under $40. Used with an adruino uno.	1
Better description would have avoided the purchase from the start. I really wanted the other 9 sensors to work	-1
Just don't be fooled:  it is only one of them, not 10.	1
These are great for Arduino projects needing a Temperature and Humidity reading.  There is a excellent library that makes using them a snap.	1
Works good.  It is fairly fast to resond	1
handy	1
This is very reliable temperature/humidity  sensor. I tested against my 250 Dollars house thermostat, and basically I did not see any difference. You will see differences in the fraction part of this sensor, unfortunately , my house thermostat does not indicate fractions, it jumps from 72 to 73, etc.  Take a look at the pic is attached.  Happy Arduino Hacking!	1
Great sensor for price... have had three of them working 24hrs a day for over a month. I have a solar shield on one that is in the sun all the time to give better results. The sensors are connected to an Arduino and Quick Dew Point is calculated before sending to Thingspeak.com	1
We just tossed out our old electric toothbrushes and went on and purchased new ones. We debated the issues between the rotary style and the up and down style of the Philips Sonicare. We decided on the Phillips version and I am glad we did.  Using these toothbrushes with the plaque control brushes  just makes your teeth feel different. They feel like they have been polished in just the 2 minute brushing cycle.  We got 2 charging stands, 2 electric toothbrushes, brush heads and two travel carrying cases for when we hit the road.  This product is so much better than the electric tooth brushes we were using and my teeth just feel cleaner. Oddly enough, my wife and I had just had our teeth cleaned at the dentist office. The next day we brought these brushes and our teeth feel cleaner now than when we left the dentist office.  I rated this product at 5 stars.	1
great deal	1
Good power	1
Such an amazing toothbrush. My teeth like they do after I go to the dentist. Highly recommend	1
Very noisy and battery cannot be replaced without damaging a unit. Cheap stuff.	-1
Great product.	1
Great stuff, it just does NOT let go.  A funeral for the Duc[t tape] should be planned.	1
This stuff is really cool, and looks great.	1
work great for the project I had.	1
love all the gorilla tape products	1
Hubby was mad at me for whatever reason and he broke the cover of a plastic organizer in his mood one day. The organizer is abut 20 years old but I cannot find anything to use to replace it with as it is a necessity in my tiny bathroom. I was going to glue it when I stumbled across this tape and figured that every other Gorilla product I used was wonderful and I would try it. I am not disappointed. Easy to apply it made a nice strong repair. Very satisfied. I don't know if it would work for anything that would require a lot of pressure or weight on it but on my plastic organizer cover, it works just fine and was much easier than gluing and figuring out how to clamp while the glue dries.	1
Pretty awesome tape. It looks like packaging tape but much thicker. It could patch inflatables, use it to fix a broken hinge, provide abrasion protection, etc.  This was a trial roll but I like it.	1
I have tried several kinds of tape to use outdoors on some research equipment.  This is the only one that works and seems to be weather proof.	1
GREAT STUFF... very clear and does what they say it will..	1
Great for dryer duct work	1
very strong and easy to use	1
Worked as designed.  Used this to connect range hood ventilation fan ducting from kitchen to roof.	1
Just what I needed on a vet job.	1
Works very well on duct work I ran in my basement. Holds well and seals joints. No leaks!	1
Very nice metallic tape. Sticks well to other metals such as tubing and is clean and plain looking without visible labels. However, it is a little pricey.	1
This take is fantastic. I got it to wrap the edges of a folding camping stove that had very sharp edges. It made the stove safer and stands up to the heat just fine.	1
Used it with my window AC. Easy to work with.	1
A lot of money for a very little amount of tape. Haven't used it yet, but sure it will work when I need it...	1
I've been using this tape for about 2 months on various projects...  it's easy to work with, peel off backing is easy to remove and the stickiness of the tape is very good - overall, performs as I had hoped.  Good product if you need such a thing!	1
pretty good foil tape, this is a very small roll but it's all that I needed. it's a much better value in the long run to buy the bigger $10 rolls, but this foil is pretty good quality and I am happy with it.	1
Works grate will be getting more soon!	1
Good	1
As advertised. Alcohol sealed in packaging great	1
These are good, I would like some that are a little bigger.	1
ok	1
Is what it says. Just nice to have around.	1
Perfect transaction and great product! Very small preps..	1
For quick cleaning of things and sterilizing small tools these are perfect.	1
Basic product, no problems, works as needed to prepare needle site.	1
works	1
Good product.	1
I use medication patches that leave glue on my arms or chest . These clean it off . Also for prep before B-12 shots . Well worth the price paid . From time to time I find uses when cleaning other items around the house too . Do not use on glasses though you must be careful .	1
perfect for your first aid kit.	1
great, and amazing deal.	1

Call me paranoid, but I like to have emergency supplies in about a half-dozen places. I always use these alcohol prep pads first when dressing minor cuts and wounds, as the alcohol both cleans the area and kills bacteria that might fester in a cut or scrape.  These are definitely small pads, at about 1" by 2" in size. This works for my uses, as I never want to carry extra weight in my backpacking and bug-out bags. Note that the alcohol saturation on these pads is great: the packet I opened was very moist with alcohol, which is what I look for in a pad. (Some I've had before were quite dry, which is annoying.)  I can't say a bad thing about these pads. They totally do the job and come at a great price.	1
Easy peasy way to use alcohol on your face and skin without the mess of using a wash rag and wasting a lot of the bottle of alcohol on the rag, then having to pay to wash the rag not to mention the added time doing laundry.  I love the alcohol pads, that are so convenient to use.	1
None of them are dried out in the package. Nice and thick weave, but, still  lint-fee. Great value. We also use these at work, I work as a nurse. I buy them from Amazon to use at home for cuts, scrapes, to clean small surfaces and to do my gel nails.	1
Good procuct.	1
great deal	1
Great for replenishing or supplementing wilderness first aid kits. In addition to the obvious uses, effective when purifying stream water--use the wipes to get the untreated water remaining on the lips and threads of water bottles used on the trail.	1
learning	1
yep, they switch, also breadboard friendly	1
Great glue worked well for what I needed it for.	1
yum	1
good as it gets	1
Oh, yeah. This is the super type glue that makes the others jealous. Ive used it on ceramics, plastics, glass...it holds. Naturally, you cant use it on something like dishes or glassware that you intend to use and wash, but for decorative items, it is great,	1
Works great for attaching stainless steel strips to nylon. This is the 2nd bottle I've purchased and I just don't understand why these bottles are only filled to about 1/3 of the way up.....either fill them up a lot more or cut the bottle size in half! It looks like you're getting cheated....like you buy a bottle of soda in plastic, but it is only filled less than half way.  It's a good product, but put more in the bottle!!	1
Excellent at sealing cracked headlight, something the superglue couldn't do	1
Gorilla Glue came through for me on an important fine furniture repair.  A bit of the carved foot pad of a Queen Anne arm chair had split due to moisture.  The fracture was clean, and along an even grain surface.  Enter Gorilla Glue.  I had to tape the treated surfaces together to provide tension on the contact...and the result is standing up to months of moving the chair leg around over carpet.	1
This is a great value for superglue. Loctite wants to charge you the same amount of money for 1/10 of the amount. No-brainer. I will not be going back to Loctite brand. Gorilla glue has got my business.	1
Best superglue I have used yet! WOW Dries super fast, anywhere from seconds to an hour depending on how much you use and air/temperature conditions and is STRONG	1
This stuff works great on PLA plastic.	1
works as expected	1
Great stuff!	1
When too much is applied the affected area doesn't dry but once any excess is removed an apparently tight bond is achieved. Time will tell how lasting it will be.	1
as expected	1
Good Product	1
Thank You	1
Good stuff. Works.	1
Good stuff. If you want to fill in a crack sprinkle baking soda on it when it is wet. It will fill in cracks holes anything. Just brush off. It's amazing. Try this.	1
just used once so far.  so far, so good.  the two unknowns so far are:  a) will it hold what I glued  and b) will the bottle spout/neck dry out and make it unusable.  time will tell. it says to shake.  that was unexpected.  also, the bottle is only about 1/2 full.  probably to give room to shake. after much shaking, i was unable to tell if anything had "properly mixed". but it worked.  adding small dabs to a tiny part was easy...just lightly tap - don't squeeze.	1
ok	1
Just like crazy glue but this screw on top is great.  It does not clog like the other types of crazy glue.  I actually had a different brand that I just poured into this bottle when empty.  Will be buying again.	1
Works well , easy to use ,  strong	1
good glue	1
This glue works great. An actual Super Glue that actually works. I prefer this gel because it's thicker than the regular type and won't run all over the place, accidentally gluing your fingers together. I have used it on porcelain, plastics, hard rubber with great results.	1
This is great glue!  It dries fast and hold everything I've glued so far.  The best part is that it doesn't dry up in the bottle within a day after you open it.	1
Works great for gluing miniatures that don't respond well to other super glues.	1
This stuff works great for the most part, every once in a while I find something that has a super smooth surface doesn't seem to want to hold; that could just be a limitation of glue in general.  Make sure you shake the bottle every time, and I'd also warn buyers that it has a strong odor so make sure you use it in a ventilated area.	1
Works great just it is not dry by 10 seconds like it says and sometimes not even 1 minute	1
Sticky	1
great stuff	1
Great stuff.	1
The stuff seems pretty good! It's not runny like crazy glue  it's more of a gel. I don't know how to get the last bit out of the squeeze bottle  I haven't gotten that far yet :-)  The resealable bottle is easier to use than any of the crazy glue containers I have used (except for the "ball point pen "style; that one is easy for small projects.	1
No matter which of the Gorilla glues that I use, I am always happy with the results.	1
always great	1
Gel is so much easier to use than liquid!  It also doesn't dry up inside the bottle as fast.	1
great	1
The gel is where it's at. Works as you'd expect.	1
Love my gorilla tapes and glue!	1
No matter which of the Gorilla glues that I use, I am always happy with the results.  I think that they have recently released a few new ones.	1
The FLIR E6 with WiFi w/ UPC 845188014131 (****) is one notch below the E8, which has the IR (infrared) resolution (of its thermal sensor/detector) of 320 x 240 pixels, but costs $1000 more.  The E6s thermal 160 x 120 pixels are interpolated up giving only slightly less detailed image than native, as the IR pictures tend to be fluid/fuzzy anyway.  Then 320 x 240 multi-spectral dynamic imaging (MSX) adds detected edges of objects to IR images allowing simultaneously to, e.g. read a label or identifier, and thus providing detail that highlights and orients problem locations and eliminates the need to refer back to the visual.  The 320  240 color 3 LCD landscape touchscreen displays the interface without image cropping.  The Dark Precision intuitive user interface has a simple central button access point and on-screen tool tips.  Simple touchscreen tools (focus-free lens and simple button navigation to on-screen settings, imaging modes, measurement tools, and saved JPEGs) allow easy operating even with a gloved thumb.  Picture-in-picture (PiP) can overlay thermal images onto digital scenes for extra location documentation.  The new feature allows to thermally tune the images by adjusting the level & span.  3 measurement modes incl.: spot (center), area box (min/max), and isotherm (above/below temperature set in alarm as red/blue).  The thermal sensitivity is 0.06 C and the temperature range is -4 to 482 F (-20 to 250 C) with the accuracy of 2 % or 2 C.  The field of view is 45  34 and the frame rate is 9 per sec. (Hz or fps).  The camera is encased in rubber (rubberized), has the lens cap built in, and sustains a 2-meter drop.  It is PC and Mac compatible.  The warranty provides 2 years coverage on the camera, 5 - on batteries, and 10 - on the detector.	1
Extremely easy to use thermal imaging camera from one of the leaders in thermal camera. FLIR cameras have been used for R&D and in the field for thermal testing for years but they've always been much more expensive. Now, for a fraction of the cost of previous models, this 160x120 imaging camera is both easy to use and extremely accurate for detecting thermal leaks, hot spots, and other heat issues easily. This makes it much easier to use for home inspection and for smaller companies or contractors needing to do thermal imaging for various reasons.  Using the center spot feature, the temperature is clearly displayed at the area marked at the center of the screen and can be recorded easily for thermal testing where every degree matters. Of course the units can be switched between C and F, and all features are easily accessed with one hand using the center control buttons. You can change between 5 color palettes for the heat signature (I prefer Iron and Rainbow) and change the range using the auto hot and cold spot feature, which I found very useful. There are also a few modes which allow you to blend the thermal and regular image together, next to each other, or just thermal or normal - all depending on your needs. You can take photos of the images and export them to your computer to give to customers or build reports. The camera comes with computer software that works on Mac or PC and allows you to edit the photos and point out temperatures at different areas of the images if desired.  For how technically advanced this camera is, it really is quite simple to operate and it's also really easy to keep charged. Just plug a micro USB cable into the port at the top and the rechargeable battery located in the base charges up. You can purchase additional batteries if you will be in the field for a while and not able to charge the camera, but if you have the ability to charge a phone, you can basically charge the E6.  FLIR also makes an E4, E5, and E8. They are all very similar with the exception of the capture resolution. The E4 and E5 have lower resolution and they won't show as much detail as the E6. The E8 has double the resolution but costs about a thousand dollars more. I think the E6 is a great compromise and has enough detail for anything except small circuitry. The E6 has a great warranty, including a 10 year infrared warranty. The product comes in a very sturdy "Pelican" style plastic case with foam insert and is built to take on the road and last a long time, even with heavy use. A thermal imaging camera like this from FLIR used to cost more than 5 times this price, and this is basically the same technology but updated and easier to use. I have no complains about this camera. It's extremely easy to use and maintain, and just works great right out of the box with no learning curve at all. The E6 is also available with NIST certification if needed for an extra 500 dollars or so.	1
The default (Iron) color gradient is sufficient for almost anything, but there are others for more specialized work. The high/low temperature readings are dead on. I checked several areas with other temp guns and it is exact. Onboard memory is huge and should last a long time. Connecting to a computer is easy and quick. Charging is about standard (3 hours for me). There is a WiFi setting that I haven't used yet, will update late. The MSX setting is a bit offset, maybe it's intentional, but it provides a visual reference and works for me. Attached are two quick examples of things we overlook. Electrical and Mechanical. Of course, I cannot show pictures of readings from a server room, but taking heat readings can save lots of money on mis-installed hardware. Cooling is a big deal in IT and yet it is assumed that everything functions properly. Providing a clear picture of where hardware is improperly installed can make fixing it easy, and give management something to use. I've been wishing for something like this for years. For HVAC techs, or any other site survey kind of work, this FLIR tool provides solid and accurate information needed to make big budget decisions.	1
Ive had this for a few weeks and have already used it more than I thought possible at work. So far the only save Ive experienced was identifying a loose wire connected to a motor drive which really surprised me. Everything else has been the fun of seeing things in a different way.  Then I asked my building inspector try it out on a new house we are buying for an in-state relocation. He graciously used this camera instead of the one he typically uses, and is considering buying one for a couple of reasons: 1.  The optical camera overlay makes it less necessary to include an optical image for clarity, but if you want to, this camera will take one with the same zoom and field of view as the IR image.  Great for reports. 2.  It seems counterintuitive, but this camera has a more detailed and slicker-looking IR output than his current, higher resolution camera. 3.  The manual range adjustment is intuitive and easy to use. The bad? Nobody likes micro-USB. The connectors are cheap and nasty, the cords are horrible, and in this case, the wall wart is an inconsiderate space hog. If you buy this, get a spare battery and dedicated charger (which should be included at this price in my opinion).	1
as expected	1
Never buy anything from xyzprinting they will not honor their Warranty if the product is defective and they have zero support if something goes wrong with the product. Worst company ever. Never ever buy anything from them ever.	-1
I received the Da Vinci 1.0 AiO as a gift.  I have been extremely happy with this product.  I personally do not mind having to use the Da Vinci cartridges.  It helps me keep track of how much filament I have used and keeps me from running prints I do not have enough filament for.  I have only tried the scanner a handful of time.  But, I have been happy with the results.  Most of the problems I have run into have been my own fault.  The only real complaint I have is that you have to use the proprietary software to print.  There are so many software solutions available, and most of them are better than XYZware.  However, you cannot make use of other software without modifying the product, which I am hesitant to do.	1
Good printer.  Scanner is complete and total crap.	-1
great printer	1
EDIT:  THIS JUST IN!  My heated bed failed due to various reasons.  XYZ took my information and rushed me a replacement bed within a few days of my request for assistance.  Fantastic.  I think a lot of the negative reviews of this and other 3D printers stems from a lack of understanding of the technical aspects of the process.  We are not at the point where you can push a button and a fully-realized 3D object beams in before your eyes.  Once you peel back the marketing hype and realize 90% of the objects seen in demo pictures are fake...  it all comes together.  I have been 3D printing with SLI and FMD type machines since the 1990s, so I know what these machines can and can't do.  I am also well versed in CAD/CAM and know my way around machinery of all sorts.  A process this technical is not going to work right out of the box -- you are going to have to level the plate,  recalibrate everything and possibly put loose connections back in place.  I did all of that with this unit and I don't see a reason to ding a star for it.  Material-wise,  you are paying good money for a spool of material in a simple-to-load cartridge system.  It sucks that it is chipped and can't be refilled but the tradeoff is the material is very consistent and that makes it easy to troubleshoot print-issues.  I had a bit of trouble initially with the recommended glue-stick method of sticking prints to the bed and switched to Kapton tape.  Again no reason to ding them for something that is easy to troubleshoot using google and experience.  Print quality is about what I expected for the price -- this is not a Makerbot or an SLI machine -- it does fairly coarse prints.  I knew what I was getting when I put the money down for it however.  If you are expecting micron-resolution prints of famous European landmarks,  pass this unit by.  However if you are making plastic gears,  prototype brackets and stuff like that... it's perfect.  I made two fairly large sprockets and was able to use them in an invention of mine with some minor cleanup and detailing.  Speedwise,  don't expect instant gratification from this or any other printer out there.  I was pleased with how fast it put the sprockets together for me,  took about six hours which was less than I had expected.  The only significant gripe I have is the scanning software.  It kind of sucks!  The hardware is capable, but the included software was clearly written by an infinite number of Chinese Coders in front of Commodore 64s.  An equally infinite number of monkeys could have written a better suite of software and we all KNOW monkeys can't write software -- remember Windows ME?  *shiver*  Anyway once I located a third-party solution for the scanning software I was up and running.  Still takes quite a bit of knowhow to turn a scan into a model but it works great.  Scans quickly and if you allow for the geometry limitations of this type of scan-system it produces good results.  I'm giving it five of five stars.  I went into this expecting very little from the machine, so I was surprised when it proved to be as capable as it is.  It is no Makerbot or Star Trek level replicator,  but it is a welcome addition to my home workshop for the price.	1
First week review.  Pros. Not to expensive. Easy to get started. good printer to start with if you are unsure about 3D printing. filament carts keep your filament clean and spooled.  Cons there seems to be some quality control issues. printer arrived with the  3d scanner turntable miss-aligned. so it gave error 0033 right out of the box. easy to fix by moving the print bead up manually. unscrewing the table. and re-indexing the turntable. if you need to do this look at the sensor and put the hole in the ring inline with the sensor. Next the x-axis belt was not squared up. this made it so I was getting out of round circles. again easy to fix. loosen the  x axis bearing holder so you can move the belt  the few teeth needed to square it up. then tighten the bearing mount back up  Have to buy the filament carts from xyz. The eeprom chip that tracks filament use will leave you with a considerable amount of unused filament in the cart. on my starter cart I had about a 1/3 of a roll inside unused. Cant print clear/translucent filament  the xyz ware software is kinda glitchy it gets stuck slicing and doesn't free up memory once used very well. if it gets stuck exit the software and restart it.  Bed leveling. This is real pain. Once you get it to pass well I wouldn't use the calibrate to level it again there are much better ways. look up videos on youtube on how to do so you will be happy you did.  The scanner...... well lets just say I have not got a good scan out of it. so don't get the aio get the 1.0 instead and save yourself 100$  You can also void your warranty and flash the firmware to a open source firmware. that can be good or bad. If you do flash it make sure you know what your doing. YOU will need to set a lot of settings that XYZ already takes care of for you.  Conclusion  For the price the Da Vinci is a great starting printer. Go with the 1.0 or 2.0 over the AIO.	1
Very good printer :)	1
The software accompanying the printer is poor, poor, POOR and any help you seek from XYZPrinting  assumes you have the intellect of a monkey.  I asked, "How do you tell the printer that the object to be printed is hollow?"  The answer I got was word for word from the Software instructions for calibrating the Scanner.  I asked again and now they wanted a picture and other documentation of the object.  I STILL don't know how to tell the printer that the object is hollow. The printer does an acceptable job of printing. Overall, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this printer.	-1
<div id="video-block-R3KZK5FXDZ7AE5" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/E13g68C-NSS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DrGKScTCS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">This XYZprinting Da Vinci 1.0 AiO All-in-One 3D Printer is an amazingly versatile and capable desktop 3D printer and scanner! I did a lot of research before deciding that this was the device with the features and functionality for my needs. We own a mold making business that specializes in custom designs and making small parts for restoration projects and, previous to getting this, had to carve or sculpt each master part by hand to make the mold and then pour a part from casting resin. This device lets us scan an existing piece, make a 3D model in TinkerCad (surprisingly easy), or find one on-line (see "Tips", below), and then just print as many pieces as needed. There is a bit or a learning curve but there are a lot of helpful videos on the XYZPrinting site and on Youtube (my extended review will be posted there) that significantly reduced the time it took me to come up to speed and get the results we wanted. Here are my observations:  Includes - Printer, ABS Filament Cartridge, USB Cable, Glue Stick, Cleaning Tools (Scraper, Wire Brush & Metal Picks), Quick Start Guide, and Software CD  Setup - Unboxing is easier with a second pair of hands since the unit is very heavy! The Quick Start Guide and on-line instructional videos were very helpful in identifying and removing the tape and mechanism support material, which is substantial. Once unboxed, follow the Quick Start Guide for installing and loading the included filament cartridge, and install the software (XYZware and XYZscan) from the CD or from the XYZPrinting site. I tried printing one of the test samples from the Utilities Menu (after first applying a layer from the glue stick), but noticed that the plastic was not laying flat on the print bed. It should be noted that the instruction say do not calibrate the unit since it was checked before shipping, so I contacted the company's tech support and we determined that the unit must have been knocked out of calibration during shipping. After recalibrating the print bed, the sample printed fine.  Pros - + Price; this is a very affordable (a relative term, I know) 3D printer/scanner + Design; this is self contained in a good looking and very sturdy enclosure that can fit on a desk or workbench + Printing Size; 7.8"W x 7.8"L x 7.5"H + Software; both the XYZware and XYZscan software installed (and updated) easily and work well on my very old Windows 7 laptop + Print Quality; "100-400 microns", which allows for very good quality prints (remember, the finer the layers the longer it takes to print) + Scanning Size; 5.9"W x 5.9"H (maximum of 3 pounds) + Scanning Quality; with the right model, the results can be quite good (see "Tips". below) + Support; received prompt responses with appropriate corrective actions  Cons - - Print Bed Calibration; while not necessary very often, it can be tricky and time consuming to get the bed set correctly (took me 4 tries)  Misc - * Speed; print size and quality settings greatly affect the printing speed (see "Tips", below), with larger prints sometimes taking 24 hours or longer * Proprietary Cartridges; this printer only accepts ABS or PLA plastic in cartridges sold by XYZPrinting, which is generally higher price per foot than other brands but the cartridges are easy to use, keep the plastic from unraveling, and also contain a desiccant. In addition, I suspect the company offers the printer hardware at a lower cost since they will gain revenue from sale of cartridges (the same way printer companies sell proprietary ink cartridges).  Tips - > Watch the videos on the manufactures site and on YouTube; this really saved me hours of experimenting and, likely, a lot of plastic > Keep an eye on the printing for the first layer or two; this is where the majority of failures will be noticeable and the job can be canceled before there is a lot of wasted plastic on the bed or stuck to the extruder > Wait for the print bed and printed object to completely cool before attempting to remove the print, it is so much easier! > Keep the print bed and extruder clean; this will greatly aid in successful prints, especaily with PLA filament > If you get "err, err, err" calibration error, it may be nessisary to take sandpaper to the sensor stud next to the extruder head (use CAUTION, it might be hot) > Third Party sites have a lot of great 3D models; besides the large number on the XYZprinting Gallery, there are sites like Thingiverse and MyMiniFactory that have thousands of files to download > Prints with a lot of "banding" can be smoothed out using fine grit sandpaper and/or with a soft cloth dipped in acetone > Scanning light color, non-reflective items without a lot of undercuts will produce the best results; darker items can be sprayed with white liquid plastic (which can be pealed off MOST materials once the scan is complete)  I will say that watching the manufacturer's and user videos helped set my expectations on what this printer and scanner is capable of doing and helped me avoid making frustrating (and expensive) mistakes. I received the printer from the manufacture for evaluation purposes and my review is based solely on my experiences. We have easily produced some very complex scans and prints, both for personal enjoyment and for professional business use, which is really just amazing to me from a consumer priced 3D "All-in-One" product.  Highly Recommended!  CFH	1
I deleted my old comment that this was garbage.  I got a replacement and I think it's only fair to write an updated review.  If this doesn't work right out of the box, SEND IT BACK!  Looks like there were a lot of manufacturing mishaps based on my web research.  The printing function actually works quite well.  I tried one of their models as a test and it was fine.  When I uploaded my own designs to it - it worked really fine!  :-)  The scanning feature is not perfect.  If you want to scan things in, use only simple models and make sure they don't have a glossy paint-job.  I'm still unimpressed by xyz's customer support (could only get responses via email and many hours later), but when a lot simple 3-D printers are going for over $1k...  I can live with it.	1
Very handy shrink tubing set.  Already used it and love it.	1
Nice set and case	1
work as advertised	1
These worked well, and were much cheaper than the set I bought at Home Depot. Also, there were more of the larger sizes that I could use, and fewer of the needle-thin kind that I have no use for. I recommend. They were sold out, but I see they are available again. I just ordered another box.	1
Item as listed, lots of options	1
This is the good stuff. Nice 3x1 shrink ration. Good adhesive for airtight seal. Organizing bin!  The only con i have it that when it shrinks a lot, it also drys hard not flexible.	1
Not sure what is meant by "Dual Wall". I would say these are standard thickness, not double thickness, so the second "wall" must be the adhesive liner. Marketing would never deceive you, would they? Anyway, the adhesive liner is not very thick, not as thick as some I have used that literally ooze hot melt glue out the ends when you shrink it, but probably adequate for anything less than continuous submersion under water. Actual tubing quality is excellent. Not sure if this material has a "UV" (sunlight) rating, I would expect it was made to be used outdoors, as well as indoors. Great assortment of sizes. It all comes packaged in a plastic divider box as shown. UPS, managed to break the box in shipping, but I have come to expect that as normal these days. I would probably buy this again when I run out.	1
Nice assortment, ample adhesive inside, grips wires very well when heated and shrunk.	1
Unbeatable price. These are perfect for having in the shop. A quick test with a Bic lighter shrunk these down quick and no issue with melting/burning. Great variation of sizes. What more can you ask for?	1
OK	1
works great	1
great	1
perfect	1
Heavy walled and appropriately adhesive lined, shrinks evenly and quickly	1
quality good, price good, prompt delivery	1
Works as designed.	1
Great stuff for a fair price.	1
This has plenty of heat shrink tubes that should last me a long time. Love the fact they come in different sizes and colors. Added bonus they come in this case nicely separated already.	1
just tried the product and it works well and a good no-brainer on the job. end product looks very professional.	1
The heat shirk ratio on the product is 3 to 1.  The result is a more versatile set of applications.	1
Work well and I'm always using this stuff.	1
Many colors allow for coding.	1
i love this stuff, with the adhesive heat shrink everything stays waterproof. great stuff and will order again. great selection of colors	1
Three hundred heat shrink tubes in an organized case? Yes please! Not only are they great for splicing wires, they can also reinforce thin insulation over cables prone to wear and tear.	1
Well they work great, if I was to mention any fault it would be that you receive a large amount of larger diameter tubing more so it seems than the smaller diameter, now I don't know about you but I don't deal very much with 1/2" diameter wire. Other than that the price is good and quality is very good. I would buy again! Hope my review was "Helpful to you, let me know if you have any questions. Thanks..	1
Great item	1
good quality no losses perfect where it was designed	1
great product & seller.	1
great heat shrink tubing kit, I love it.	1
great heat shrink tubing kit, I love it.	1
VERY GOOD	1
works well	1
Very nice assortment of good quality heat tubing.........wish I had had something like this YEARS ago!  :)  Would recommend.	1
Using this for my Quadcopter power, signal, esc cables all sorts and sizes. I LOVE this heat shrink set. I LOVE the color coding, I feel like a little kid playing with legos I swear to god.  If you are reading this comment/review, buy the kit. Stop reading, just order it, it's ten bucks. You will love it just as much as I do.  I'm not even using fancy tools, just a lighter and a wet sponge to wipe off the smoke marks if I get it too hot. Ordered the bigger kits too because I started blowing through this kit using up all the different sizes.  Great cable strain relief, great electrical insulator, great chafe wrap.  Got it? Get it!	1
They work well,  shrink just as expected	1
Great selection of sizes and colors come in handy when doing electrical repair work!	1
[Sold by: iauto] Bought this as part of a car stereo install.  Was making a Pioneer to Toyota cable harness and was using bare crimp terminals.  Used this to shrink over bare crimp terminals and then shrink multiple wires/crimps together into bundles.  Definitely shrinks to half the size. So if 2mm dia. before shrink then it shrinks to 1mm dia.. After shrink the wrap remained somewhat flexible, but was still thick and had no rips/tears/breakthrough. Good selection of various sizes and I prefer black. Do NOT use flame or soldering iron. Use a good heat gun and all will go well. The NTE Electronics ECG HG-300D Mini Heat Gun sold by Electronix Express here on Amazon worked very well.  It has Hi and Lo heat settings.  Used Hi with no damage to wire or heat-shrink tubing.	1
This kit has a lot of larger size tubing and only a couple of smaller sizes. Most of what I do needs some small diameter so I'm guessing it won't be long before I have three empty slots and no remaining useful sizes. I should have just bought the sizes I needed but that's my problem not the products.	1
The box isn't tight enough, some pieces will jump into another section even if the lid is closed.  It's pretty normal shrink wrap quality	1
Perhaps "love it" is too strong, but this stuff is good for what it is. LOTS of diameters and lengths. I'm restoring an old house, and where the old knob-and-tube exits, sometimes the insulation is pretty brittle I use a section of this, pushed as far up into the tube as I can get it, and heat it in with a hair dryer. (I have more hours by far on my new "expensive" dryer blowing these than I do on my own hair... please don't tell my hairdresser she'd have a cow because it is such a spendy pro  model.) Anyway, one of these to cover as much as I can cover, tight. Then another to add some bulk. It won't usually get tight. Then a 3rd layer of the biggest size (3/8- or 1/2-inch) that will fit over the tube sticking out. Heat that, and now it is a pretty sturdy bit of K&T to work with. If I have to extend it a few inches because it's been abused to within an inch of its life (literally), I solder a bit of #14 stranded onto it first. Works great, and it really is saving me some tear-out. (Technically you can't "extend" any wire, much less K&T. But it is that or tear out a ton of ceiling and wall to tap into a new circuit somewhere... NOT something I am going to do for lack of an inch of wire.)	1
It is as advertised, wouldn't add or take anything away from it.	1
Good product and very economical.  Saves us money!	1
Excellent, works as described.	1
grate quality , shrink very tight ,will keep water out very good .	1
these heat shrink tubes work grate , grate quality thanks.	1
Good quality and can never have too much of these!	1
Great set to have in your box. Gives a nice sampling of colors to choose from and make my installs look professional.	1
not much i can complain about, a number of precut pieces in a cute little box. they shrink as said. while i could get a long strip of it, i find that's more annoying to use, which is why i went this route.	1
good	1
Excellent quality tubing. Shrinks 2:1 easily! The various sizes come in handy especially if you want to protect resistor legs (1mm)	1
Perfect! I love it! Just what I wanted! Arrived on time & exactly as described.	1
Fast shipping product just as described. Would buy again, they just take a while to shrink with heat applied but worked good and dos the job	1
IT's just fine as expected.	1
It shrinks when heated.... YES! It has color options.... YES! It has size options.... YES!	1
What can you say, it's heat shrink...  Works great and looks good!!!	1
Great product, fast shipping, fair price.  What more could you ask?	1
Just as described and shipped quickly.	1
great	1
Excellent assortment of sizes and good price.	1
This came with one of the containers empty, so I decided to count all of the heat shrinks in their separate compartment.  20 | 113 | 42 16 |  64  | 32 17 |  0  | 24  I'll spare you the math. Exactly 328 pieces as they advertise. Amazing.	1
Lots of shrink tubing, must have for any work bench.	1
I really like the case to keep it all straight.	1
This package offers a wide selection of sizes and colors of heat shrink tubing, and per my experience with a dozen so far work fine when a heat gun is used and a bit less so when the "quick and dirty" lighter or match are used.  4 instead of 5 stars due to the tubes not being as thick as some premium ones, and I likely will not use them when abrasion/wear could be a problem.	1
As advertised	1
not as much as the picture showed though	1
URBEST - U R GOOD.  Maybe not the best, but good stuff.  It's shrink wrap, so what can you say?  Good colors???  :-)	1
Great assortment of heat shrink tubing in a nice, sturdy case. Very nice to have everything neatly organized and easy to find. Well worth it.	1
I really like the variety of sizes, and the pre cut lengths are about perfect to cut in half for each joint. It was exactly what I was looking for.	1
Good assortment of quality shrink wrap at a decent price.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	1
This is a very good assortment of tubes of various colors and sizes. Great for occasional work. The shrink ratio is good. I wish it had more of the medium-sized tubes instead of the very large ones.	1
This is a nice pack with a good variety of tubes for the more or less occasional work. The shrink ratio is good.	1
Very Good Product...	1
Exactly what i needed for insulating cables	1
Fast shipping , good quality.	1
The product was as described.	1
just what I needed	1
great buy	1
Great little case with lots of differnent size optiosn. They works great.	1
Exactly what I needed for the right prices. Great variety!	1
Works fine.	1
Great product and needed for small wiring projects.	1
Love them.	1
Great Value, does the job	1
PRO:  Fast shipping  CON: not as long as I'd hoped on some.  OTHER:  Worth the buy.	1
Nice assortment - they shrink well.	1
Worked as designed and super price.	1
Does the job and glad that they are colored	1
Not much you can review on heat shrinks.  It came in with a nice plastic case.	1
A good variety of sizes for any application.	1
Sad !	-1
When you need a plunger you need one!  This one is very sturdy and works well.  What else is there to say except it gets the job done!  I would certainly recommend this product to others.	1
This is best Plunger !!! 5 Stars Dennis Pa	1
Low cost, no frills necessity for anyone with indoor plumbing.  The rubber seems a little thinner than that on the older plungers I have, but it still works.  I bought this one to replace the one that disappeared from my upstairs bathroom.  Note that when it arrived, the smaller part was turned inside out inside the bigger cup, which confused me for a minute until I looked more carefully at it.  The smooth fiberglass handle is nicer than a wood handle, because it's smoother.  There is a loop on the end so it can be hung.	1
It's OK.  I didn't like the extended part of the plunger.  It seems like a cheap piece of rubber and it also collects water from the toilet when it is folded inside of the plunger.  I trimmed it off and ended up with just the plunger I needed.  Works fine in a standard toilet bowl now.	1
One big push!! And the turd went down and out.	1
does the job!	1
Like it. All good. No negative surprises.......	1
it is a plunger and it works	1
Works well on toilet or shower drain.	1
like new (uh, was new :))	1
Plastic is very cheap and easily broke at the end.	-1
It is amazing how the littlest of tools can make such a huge impact on your brewing. The first time I hooked this thing up to my tubing and unleash my wort into the fermenter, it was way foamier than I could have ever made it by shaking the fermenter. This also works very well for sparging your grains and recirculating (vorlauf) your runnings for clarity, without disturbing the grains (which act as an extra filter on top of your false bottom/manifold.)	1
Wish they made these a bit sturdier, but even cracked it still works.	1
Does a nice job adding air to wort	1
Works like I needed it to. Size in description was correct.	1
Helps aerate when dumping wort.	1
Works great even on gravity feed as well as siphon set ups	1
Good quality carrier, easy to use.  Lot safer than trying to handle the carboy without!	1
Getting ready to get into homebrewing some beer in 5 and 6 gallon carboys.  Having had the unpleasant experience of dropping a carboy full of beer some years ago and mopping up 5 gallons of beer, I decided I would rather not repeat that experience.  These fit the carboys perfectly and will make it much easier to handle full carboys with wet slippery hands.	1
Works great	1
Wine and beer weigh about 10lb per gallon and most carboys are between 10 and 15 pounds, so we're dealing with a slippery glass container weighing about 75lb! Not the easiest thing to pick up and move around. This is where the Brew Hauler comes into play. With 6 support straps and 2 loop handles it is much easier and safer to move your carboys around. The belt strap sinches to keep it in place and removes easily when you are ready to clean your carboy.  I now have several of these and never lift a carboy without one.	1
Worked perfectly on my big mouth bubbler.	1
These are just the best carboy carriers. Have 7 of them. The company is dedicated to making a great product even better! They are using a metal spring loaded buckle that grabs the web belt. Super easy to adjust the tightness of the belt around the carboy. Great design for this application.	1
Exactly as I ordered. I would purchase again. Very good quality.	1
This Brew Hauler is better than my older one. I like the more secure clasp on this one.	1
Great product	1
Able to lift up my carboys fully loaded with beer. Love these things	1
So far this thing has been great to have. Just make sure the snap is secure. I hauled a 6.5 gallon carboy up and down the stairs with this. Also makes it much easier getting in and out of our fermentation chamber (chest freezer).	1
decent set, has a lot of options, but they are pretty cheap quality. I would not recommend them. I broke the first one i used. I have a dremel, it does shave off metal decently tho. I would try a different brand.	-1
Nice precision set of cutters. good variety, and they seem to hold up well so far.	1
Product arrived quickly and does what I needed it to do.	1
This is great assortment for use with my Dremel tool. Variety is great.	1
great	1
Nice carbide bits for fine detail wood carving. They fit my older Dremel tool collet perfectly without slipping or jamming. They seem, so far, to be well balanced. I haven't tried every single one yet. These are not for aggressive work or removing large amounts of wood. They are small points of various shapes with accordingly fine teeth. 20 carbide cutters for under 20 bucks is a really good deal in my opinion. Nice little plastic case too.	1
Fantastic set.	1
A really nice selection of single & double cut burr points that I have found work well for grinding in small areas of a work piece, can easily be used for a variety of tasks on a Dremel or Flex Shaft rotary tool.	1
excellence	1
A very nice assortment for short money. I'm happy so far.	1
You get what you pay for. Didn't work as well as I thought it should . I'm going to change the type of wood to see if it works better. They burned the wood as I carved.	1
Ok thank you, nice tungsten.	1
Nice selection of burs at a decent price fit and finish is good.  I've not used this set extensively so I don't have an opinion on durability - the point of Tungsten Carbide.	1
Nice quality and color screws. They seemed a little bigger in the photo but will work great for thin fastening items	1
Bought these for "InstallerParts Cable Tie Mount 22mm -- Black  100 Piece Pack" as they were recommended as a 'group' purchase. Head of screw is too small and is pretty much useless.	-1
Good screws for the cable tie saddles, but they could be just a bit longer.	1
These are very hard to find, but perfect for working in small spaces like a metal electrical cabinet. I use them to secure tie wrap straps or to hang electrics that have hanger holes already (modems, wifi, routers, etc.)	1
Very nice screws, and a super upgrade to the very soft brass ones I was using before.  These hold up really well, and don't show any signs of stripping anytime soon, even when driving into rock-hard maple!  Great, small screw.	1
Good wood screws	1
Its a screw. But they were a good deal. I cannot find black screws at the hardware store by me for some reason.	1
Very useful, plus come with the exact amount. A++++	1
Have not used any yet. Just wanted to restock my hardware drawer. They look just fine and should the job for me.	1
They do there job	1
Good wood screws	1
Just spent the entire weekend standing in my stocking feet on these mats in my crafting room and I LOVE them! These two 24 inch interlocking corner pieces are actually provide the perfect length and width for my work area and actually did allow me to work comfortably without the shooting pain that typically runs from my knees to my hips when I stand for longer than an hour on concrete.  I was also able to roll my ball chair up on to it without creating gouges in the mats, these are beautifully made and fit together so seamlessly that I think I might just save up and invest enough squares to cover the entire floor between the work bench to my sewing machine.	1
On the surface this mat appears to be similar to the various child-friendly floor foam tiles.  And it's not that dissimilar in concept, but whereas the typical foam tiles feel like foam, this feels more like a springy memory-mattress sort of foam tile.  It's very fun to walk on because it actually has bounce to it.  I received 2 tiles to review - and that doesn't cover a whole lot of space.  They are expensive, but I'm buying 4 more for the basement laundry room.  If money were no object, I'd tile the playroom in these.  They feel absolutely wonderful to walk on.	1
seems to work as described.  have not checked it against hygrometer	1
very useful in beer brew industry	1
The product Washington shipped on time and arrived perfect	1
Had me believing my brew was not ready. Hydrometer said differently. Not-trustworthy. Sent it back after 1 month. Back to hydrometer only	-1
Easy to use and see, easy to calibrate.	1
as described	1
Works as advertised. Just remember this is only good for OG DO NOT try on FG since this is not designed to account for alcohol already present in the solution.	1
Too long to receive! Good product, works as expected	1
These K type thermocouples are a good value and worked for my application. My only complaint is that they really do not stay where you put them. I thought the wires would hold their form, but i guess they're too thin inside to hold onto an angle.  On the plus side, the fiberglass covering is great for keeping everything safe from heat. My application is in a film drying cabinet and doesn't get over 175F at the hottest point so I'm not stressing these.  They worked out of the box and i would recommend them.	1
Work great in my application.	1
OK thermocouples. The wire covering will discolor around 250C, though.	1
These are far more reliable than they should be. These have been tortured!!! Lesser leads/probes have melted, burned up, or otherwise failed. The cloth covering is fairly acid resistant. A nearly perfect probe!	1
One came damaged. Wasn't worth the trip to the post office to return.	-1
What I was looking for	1
a+	1
EMT/trauma/bandage shears are generally cheap and flimsy, dull quickly, and are disappointing to frustrating to use.  Look around here on Amazon and you can find them for just a few dollars each.  This is necessary because most agencies/departments/hospitals/clinics/practices/doctors treat them as almost -- if not totally -- disposable.  If a pair gets a little bit dirty or contaminated, maybe it can be scrubbed with disinfectant and/or autoclaved; but it's usually not worth the risk, so a dirty or contaminated shears is just thrown away.  These "premium" shears at about $7.50 each are a nice step up.  They're much sturdier, better quality, and work nicely.  They are suitable for chemical disinfection and autoclaving.  But they're still not so expensive that they can't just be thrown away if necessary.	1
These are well made and sharp.  I bought them for our emergency packs we keep in the cars.  The handle is nice and comfortable and is easy to hold and work with.  The rounded edge on the end makes these very safe to have on hand.  They cut gauze easily and the quality of the stainless steel is good too.  I recommend these for any emergency bag or just to have on hand at the house in case you need them.  The price was right and they are better than I had imagined.	1
Premium Quality? Not really but the price is right and perfect for someone like me who keeps these in emergency first aid kits. I wouldn't think that someone who uses them day in and day out would be happy with them....but I'm not an EMT or in the healthcare field, so who knows.	1
These SS EMT shears are well made and should do the job quite nicely.	1
I had ordered a pair of these shears in tactical black some time back and they cut decent enough. But because they were black it was hard to see what was being cut. So I ordered a 2 pack of Stainless Steel shears from Madison Supply and the bright silver color made it much easier to see that only the covering (clothing or bandage) was being cut and still stay far enough away from the wound. This package arrived fairly quickly after placing the order for them. Price was decent as well. I like 'em.	1
Excellent product.  Works great with minimal hand fatigue.	1
Used them when I was working. I did not rested how useful they are at home and everywhere else. I keep one in my car.	1
Very sharp super easy to use great scissors will buy again!	1
Good product! For the price, these are hard to beat. Two pair of nice stainless steel EMS trauma shears.	1
***Note...While everything I said holds true, the control board for this printer has changed since my post.***  Other updates at end of review  First off let me say this is not a plug and go printer. You're not going to unpack it and start printing. This is a kit, and it will take some time to put together. You will also spend a good deal of time dialing in settings and getting frustrated. At the end of it all, you will also have a great working knowledge of how these things work. I knew that going in, so I was fine with that. If that's not something you are ok with, then this may not be the kit for you.  If you're still reading, this is my experience so far.  Packing/Shipping: Nothing bad to say. It shipped a day ahead of time and arrived two days later in good condition. Some believe this belongs on the supplier page, but since this product is only offered by one supplier, and they handle the shipping, I think it is appropriate here.  Assembly: It was easy enough. Just go step by step, and take your time. Keep in mind that you are screwing into MDF. Bolts should be snug, but not torqued down. You may also want to have a knife and sandpaper handy. I found that one of the parts had a hole that was nearly 3 millimeters off, and the tab had to be trimmed significantly to get it to fit. The rest were pretty tight, but manageable.  There were some parts not there, and a few others have been changed without amending the manual, but overall it was easy enough.  You'll find that the instructions call for 6 flat washers that are not supplied. According to QUBD, these are no longer needed. Maybe I got a unique kit, but they absolutely were needed as there is a roughly 2mm gap between the bolt head and what it is holding together without them.  The part that holds the hot end to the printer calls for two 30mm bolts, but the ones I got were 25mm. Also, the bolts holding the build platform are M3 instead of M4 as listed. In both cases the replacements worked fine, but it's something to be aware of.  Structure: Seems solid enough. I wouldn't trust it to survive a fall from a desk, but there is very little movement in the fixed parts. There's some sagging and wobbling in a few of the moving parts as I didn't use the recommended superglue on them. I would assume that would fix a lot of those issues, but since I plan to customize this printer quite heavily I didn't bother with it. It's completely usable as it sits.  Printing: I've only printed one part so far, and it was OK. Not great, but better than expected for a first go. Getting everything set up and calibrated is a bit of a confusing process for the newcomer, but overall hasn't been too bad. It's going to take some tweaking to get really good prints, but looking at the first try there doesn't appear to be any reason it shouldn't be possible.  Overall Impressions: I went into this knowing the work that was going to be involved with getting everything set up and working. I knew that perfect prints right out of the gate were not likely at all, and I was aware of some of the structural issues that have been noted here and elsewhere. As someone wanting to learn how to construct, modify, and troubleshoot a 3D printer, this is a great choice for me. It may not be for you.  I look at it this way: Buying the motors, control board, power supply, and hot end alone can easily run you $200 retail. You'd still need the rods, belts, hardware, and frame. Yeah, you can find the parts cheaper on ebay, but for someone new to the hobby that wants to build a printer, this is a great place to start.  The great thing about 3D printers is that they can print their own upgrades. I plan to be doing a lot of that in the coming weeks, and have no doubt that this printer will soon be an even more capable machine.  March 05 A little while back my Printrboard stopped responding altogether. After going through all the steps I could think of to revive the board, I sent a message to QU-BD through the contact form here late Wednesday night. Thursday morning I had an email response instructing me to send the old one back and they would send a replacement as soon as they had tracking info. I mailed it later that day and sent the info, and received confirmation and tracking on my replacement. It left their facility the next day, and was on my printer by Monday. I've heard a lot of poor reviews on the customer service from them, but I've never had an issue. Three business days from point of contact to replacement in hand is pretty good if you ask me.	1
From the very beginning, there were red flags. I did not go into this expecting some amazing printer, or something that would make things that look like they were injection molded. But I was still incredibly disappointed, frustrated, and angry. Some of the parts were not the correct size. Rods didn't fit into the bearings, holes were not drilled with the proper alignment, a linear bearing even had its bearings falling out. They sent me a couple new rods and bearings, but even the replacements didn't roll smoothly and stuck a lot. I didn't feel like wasting more time with getting yet another replacement. The mdf material this is made of cracked in several places during assembly, since the 'laser cut' (apparently not precision cut) pieces didn't quite line up. After a few replacement pieces, and finally completing the build, the first big problem was the X gantry sags. A LOT. As the print head moves around, the right side raises and lows, since it has no support. It sags so much, that I was unable to fully compensate for it even with totally raising one side of the bed and completely lowering the other. I did eventually purchase the heated bed from QUBD, hoping that would help some of the other issues it was having, but it didn't. They actually didn't even send me all of the parts that were supposed to come with the heated bed, and the bed has a crack in it, and after 6 days, I still have no response from them. But back to this travesty of a printer. As the gantry sags, you can see the top support sway, which throws it off even more. No matter how tight the screws are, there always seems to be play in the parts. The software that was loaded onto it when I received it did not work properly, and had the X and Y axises mirrored, and one of the motors had different colored wiring than the others, adding to the confusion of building, since this is the 'new' version, which apparently has very little support out there and the instructions had several spots that did not match the parts in the kit. I tried flashing the marlin firmware, and eventually found a firmware on the qubd site that did get it to actually print, in that it would move in approximately the appropriate motions, but still with all sorts of errors. The Y belt is never able to get quite tight enough, without modification of the pieces that hold it, so as it prints, it introduces more and more shifting in the Y direction. The X motor has always made a sort of grinding noise, and jumps a lot when making small movements, the extruder gear is not actually round (or the hole is drilled off-center) causing the filament to either not have enough tension to be pushed through, or too much tension and it tears it up or skips back, with every revolution. The Z motor is now skipping any time it moves more than one or two steps, and just lightly hums, so when the extruder is lifted to heat up, then goes down to start a print, it has to be manually moved back down to the correct location. The bed (non-heated) is not actually flat. It seemed to have a bulge in one spot, slightly off center, and no matter how often I leveled it, it would not allow me to use the full size of the bed without print errors. I have spent a month looking on forums, getting advice, and even had someone with much more 3d printing experience come over, but all to no avail. If the print speed is anything about around 20mm/s, I don't even get something that will resemble the model, and even with it going slow, the extrusion rate has to be cranked way up, which causes all sorts of deformations. The extruder PEEK (the cylinder insulator that basically holds the extruder to the carriage) has never fit properly into the 'mounting' and generally sits about 2-3 degrees off of vertical, causing smears and eventually ruining the layers. I have rebuilt this thing 5 times so far, and the extruder at best sits off-kilter, and generally shakes itself loose and will actually wobble around as it moves. Anything that is printed higher than about 5-7 layers starts gettings holes, spirals, gaps, missing layers, etc. This has been a nearly wasted month. I say nearly, because I did learn that I will not use a printer with a single z motor, made from mdf, or that is the 'cheapest'. I just hope that I can get my return approved, I would even settle for Amazon credit at this point.	-1
Have had my printer for 3 months. Got everything put together and software installed. I had a problem with my board and one motor wouldn't spin. It was the board not the motor. Finally got them to understand what was wrong and they told me to send the board back,  so i did. 3 or 4 weeks later i received 1 part of the 6 part board.  Then contacted qubd and I sent one more pic of the board,  still missing the 4 little boards. And have sent out multiple tickets over the last 3 weeks with no response. All in all the product isn't a bad one if you set aside that it is a little difficult to put together due to improper laser cuttings, iffy instructions and parts list with a few modifications, you can have a good printer. I mean it was a good learning experience and i understand how the printer works and wouldn't be scared to set off and build another one. The customer service however,  is the worst ive ever dealt with. My suggestion would be to go through amazon and not qubd.	-1
The design is flawed in numerous ways, requiring significant rework using customer-generated fixes and documentation. And there are missing parts. And parts that are guaranteed to break. Buy a Printrbot instead - it costs a little more but the kit includes all the parts and instructions, and the resulting printer is great for the price, in contrast to this POS.	-1
In terms of value, this is without a doubt the best printer you can buy.  However, as others have said, this is not plug-and-play.  This is a printer for DIY'ers.  Some have complained that the assembly is awful - but it all depends on your skill level.  There are a LOT of pieces in the kit, probably 150+.  The assembly manual is 67 pages long, if that helps you understand exactly how "unassembled" this printer comes.  Expect the assembly to take 4-6 hours, a couple evenings of your time.  Personally I found it not too much more difficult that putting together a large, complex Lego or Knex model.  The assembly manual PDF is FANTASTIC although it is a little outdated, a handful of parts have changed since the manual was written.  If you see something in the manual that doesn't exactly match what you've got, don't get worked up.  Use glue *only* where suggested in the manual.  Once you have it assembled, you may find some slop in parts - use glue only where needed to true things up.  Things I used for my install - a whole pile of metric allen wrenches - sandpaper - triangular file for enlarging holes in MDF - super glue - lots of zip-ties (more than the kit came with - buy more) - double-sided tape for holding the x-carriage belt (this was later replaced with hot glue)  My kit was complete with no missing pieces, so that was great.  I did have a few hiccups though.  One of the MDF parts for the extruder bearing tensioner was cut from what appeared to be a little bit thicker MDF, so I had to sand it down to match the thickness of a mating part.  Some of the laser-cut MDF pieces didn't match up with holes/tabs exactly either, so I had to file some of the openings a little larger.  Also, my extruder gear had a few broken teeth on it out of the box.  QUBD was fairly quick to replace it.  I also did not have a fan mount, but this was easily rigged up with some zip-ties.  Once assembled, you have a working and *fair* quality 3D printer.  This is the product objective - get you working, so you can print some parts.  There are a multitude of excellent 3D printable upgrades mentioned in the manual and on Thingiverse.  Once you get the upgrades printed and installed, you have a VERY GOOD quality 3D printer, right up there in quality with machines costing 5 or 10 times as much.  If you want to learn every aspect of how a 3D printer works, this is definitely the kit to buy.  The great thing about building something yourself is, when it breaks, you usually know how to fix it.  The Fabric8r forums are a good resource if you need help.	1
This is definitely a KIT. It is not difficult at all to assemble. Instructions are very good. Some of the parts may not match exactly with the pictures you see, but it works like a charm once everything is sorted. The construction is melamine pressboard, zip-ties and super glue. It is not a robust assembly. The good news is that there are tons of parts you can download and print to make this thing 10x better for the cost of a spool of PLA. Once you complete the upgrades, this machine will amaze you.  You will need additional tools and knowledge to make this work.  - download/install a program called Repetier. Within that program, you will need to know how to 'slice'. This is the process the software uses to break down solid models into the format the printer needs. Within Repetier, the main slicing program is called 'Slic3r' (yes, that's a 3). Especially take note of the USB serial port emulator - look for tutorials on Slic3r. There's a guy on youtube named 3DPrintedLife who has fantastic tutorials on both Repetier and Slic3r. Watch those before you try printing anything - read up on g-code. There is some mention of g-code in those tutorials, but check any number of sites (RepRap Wiki for one) to understand what g-code is and how to use it. It's very simple.	1
Wonderful device	1
Neat item. And the price is right.	1
Saves me a lot of time and effort testing transistors and diodes before inserting them in a circuit.	1
great project but haven't used it yet.	1
Amazing functionality for the price. I test caps and transistors with it. Good for ESR and Hfe readings. Fully discharge caps before testing for best accuracy.	1
This is a handy little unit it has worked on every transistor I have tested except darlington it will tell you if it's NPN or PNP or if they are bad but not that they are darlington .but thats ok I got it for Jfets and Mosfets that it do's very well it gives all the info a hobby builder can use and thats all I needed plus it's easy to use and it's quick .	1
Very useful product.	1
Probably one of the most useful test tools I have ever bought.  I recently used it to diagnose bad parts (transistors, fets, resistors, caps) on three vintage amplifiers (that have sat around for a couple of years).  now they are all working.  couldn't have done it without this tester.  do not hesitate.  it works as it claims.  i figure it saved me hundreds of dollars in repair costs.  I will be working on a more permanent housing solution next, as you probably don't want to leave it laying around in its delivered state.  Wish the manufacturer would sell a case.	1
This is an amazing little device. Connected the battery, it showed the voltage to a tenth of a volt; right on. Plugged-in various MOSFETs, 2-lead diodes, 3-lead diodes (common anode), bipolars, SCRs, and resistors. All of them were identified right-on. The resistors measured within a couple of tenths of what our 4.5-digit Fluke reported ! LEDs showed up as a 2-lead diode. Zeners (under 9V) seemed to work. This tester identified the device no matter how the leads were inserted into the ZIF socket. Now I can sort through those grab-bags of parts I've collected over the years. I'll repost if anything changes or anything new comes up.	1
Worked pretty well right up untill I dropped it and broke the LCD display.	1
This product is very cool. I have been using it to identify unknown values of inductors and check semiconductors. I even got it to check dual gate mosfets!  I would pay double the price to get it with a case!!!!	1
amazing little thing.  I wish there was documentation for it.  Capacitance values seem to be off by about 10% compared to my DE-5000 which I trust, can it be calibrated? If you know of documentation let me know.	1
Junk!	-1
This tester is so handy to have around, especially if you reclaim parts from circuit boards.  Also very handy in checking the  ESR of capacitors in switching power supplies. I've used this item to check hundreds of parts, it's about the quickest way to sort a bunch of parts. I just wish there was a case for it.	1
<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Yosoo-GM328-LCD-Display-Transistor-Tester-ESR-Meter-Cymometer-Square-Wave-Generator/dp/B00OOQC2E8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Yosoo GM328 LCD Display Transistor Tester ESR Meter Cymometer Square Wave Generator</a>Great tester - works not only for transistors but diodes, resistors and capacitors as well.  It not only tells you what it is but if it's working.	1
1.  ESR reading seem to be reliable at or below 100UF, and dubious above that.  Had better luck with higher values of capacitance.  Tested up to 10,0000 UF and seemed to be consistent with readings from my fluke 179.  2.  Transistor tester works great but you have to be mindful of pin out.  Had me wondering if something was wrong at first.  Really useful for sorting parts and checking pin out.  I suppose I would trust it to match gain relative to a particular part.  3.  Some tests use any pin out.  Others might use 1, and 3.  Etc...  Problem is there is no documentation provided by the manufacture.  Good news is that if you google "TransistorTester with AVR microcontroller and a little more" you can find the documentation for the open source project that this is based on.  Look for a pdf for more recent firmware as it better covers the functionality of this version.  Reading this documentation helped me understand the limitations of this device, and pin outs for the various functions and tests.  4.  I have mixed feelings about the quality.  Functionally its reasonably well made.  9V battery clip is kind of cheap.  IMO they should have mounted a 9v battery holder to the back of the board behind the LCD.  LCD did have some minor cosmetic flaws noticeable when the back light is not on but for what I spent I will let that slide.	1
Incredible value for the money! This thing is the swiss army knife of transistor checkers. Tests transistors, diodes, capacitors, inductors, resistors. It appears to have a built in signal generator too (I haven't figured that part out yet, but it's there and generates a pulse train). The only two downfalls are 1) no documentation with it, 2) no case (raw board sits on the bench). Just the same, this thing is great. It self identifies the component and the pinout. It even reports gain for transistors (and the type of transistor). If it came with a case and a manual it would be worth $100 more, easily!	1
Works fine.  The accuracy is great and its versatility can't be beat.	1
Tho I have seen about a hundred variations of this thing and wished the back of it was protected from shorting out (easily fixed with some plastic)... This thing has done an amazingly decent job pretty accurately figuring out what im testing and giving me quite a bit of info with a little graphic of the item being tested.  I Have used it a ton to test and replace micro sized MOSFET transistors which there is no chance in seeing part numbers for. If they get out of their packaging you better have one of these to know what they are.  It is a bit annoying having to hold surface mount components or better yet, solder them to the pad on the tester but I don't know any other way anyone could test such small components. It is great no matter how you connect the component, the device will automatically tell you what leg is what without damaging the component.  Menus are a bit complicated to get into and change but it does have quite a few features inc high value capacitor testing and ESR value.	1
Good electronic device tester and more.	1
I think for the money this is an awesome test instrument. Very good for sorting out the junk box.	1
Do more that I was expecting .... missing manual, so have to figure out some features	1
I'm an old guy from the sixties and I have to say this devise "blows my mind". Ultra simple to use, just check You Tube if you have problems figuring it out. Once you see how it works you'll never forget because there's nothing to it. Unbelievable the wide range of functionality and ease of use. Mine stays on my workbench since I find myself using it quite a lot.	1
I found this device to be more accurate than earlier versions based on the ATmega328 chip.  The screen display is much sharper and the test results are faster.  Reasonably priced as well.  Can't go wrong here if you want a quick reliable all purpose tester.	1
FANTASTIC. This is as close to the unicorn-like All-In-One omni-tester as anyone is likely to get short of Scotty or Spock. I'd buy this again in a heartbeat. Works fine, shipped fast, good value.	1
works great	1
Very nice.  Works great.	1
It's amazing how nicely this tester works. It's simpler to use than any other tester I have and gives repeatable measurements but how does it work and how accurate is it? No documentation comes with it but there is great documentation on the net. Just search for Karl Heinz Kubbeler and you'll find a lot. In particular, micro controller.net has a pdf file "Transistor Tester with AVR microcontroller and a little more " that describes the measurements and accuracy of them. For most measurements its +- 1%. The only problem with board is the difficulty of putting it in a box. The readout is very high compared to the ZIF socket. If mounted in a box the test socket would be well behind the face. I'm going to try to raise this by adding a second ZIF on top of the first. So you might want to think about this or purchasing one with more planer arrangement.  Otherwise highly recommend	1
Works well.  I mounted it on a piece of plywood along with a 9V battery clip (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EEDHRCS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00)	1
Its good for the price however the tubing is a little thin.	1
Product was excellent quality and works very well	1
Originally tried using a hair-dryer but that didn't work. Now I use a torch lighter (very fast movements) and after a bit of practice I was able to rewrap a pair of 18650's in a minute or two.	1
Color coated all of my batteries to orange. Now people can't walk off with them anymore.	1
Great quality.	1
Works great on skin. It comes with a bunch of foiled seal new blades. I need it to cut off some dead skin on my foot. It did it easily. No sawing and much better than trying to use cuticle clippers or nail clippers.  Anyone who says these are not sharp are nuts. The blades are extremely sharp and all individually sealed. For the price this item is great.	1
Scalpels were difficult to install and remove from the handle.  Scalpels did not seem to be very sharp at all (although under the microscope, you could seen the finish grind).  Disposable scalpels seemed to be significantly sharper than these.	-1
Why didn't I try this before?  I love paper crafts, and recently bought a book where the author recommended using scalpel to cut paper shapes. Wow....what a difference from all those expensive X-acto blades! I'm not sure why X-acto can't put out an equally reliable blade, but these scalpel blades are DURABLE.  Every once and a while, I knick my metal ruler with these as I'm cutting and, unlike X-actos, it doesn't mangle the edge with these scalpel blades.  Less expensive, yet more reliable...no rocket science there.  Buy these instead!	1
Arrived on time. Very satisfied.	1
Very good quality. Works well. As advertised.	1
Works Great!	1
strong magnet be ready to turn outside to fit your particular gauge. nice addition for the lathe	1
Sticks to my vise just fine.	1
Sad. Worked when I got it, but it failed the second time. I don't see any warranty, so my bad for buying it. POS.	-1
This works great.  Fast and easy checking each cable as you build them. Saves me a lot of time testing on the network. Every once in a while I screw up or the connector is faulty. This device catches the errrors.	1
Mine did not work.	-1
Worked great to test all the runs I made in the attic yesterday. The lights are really bright, almost too bright if you look at them straight on.	1
Very basic, but it works great	1
As expected	1
Good tester for cables	1
Excellent.	1
works like a charm. no more guessing if the wires are in the correct position.	1
Dead after month	-1
Serves its purpose and doesn't come with a heavy price. I've used some fancy ones that tell you where the problems are, but I just needed this for casual cabling. The nicer ones save time if you're running hundreds of drops or do this for a living, but this will do in a pinch. I like that it indicates both sides, which is a huge improvement over other products. If you're working as a pair the little dummy terminations can be a pain to coordinate.	1
I was having trouble with my LAN wiring to my outside building so I purchased these to help find the problem. Somehow I got the idea that these would determine that there was stuff going on over the wire, but it actually provides the inputs and receives the other end using only the raw wire and its own protocols - it won't test working set ups. My bad. But it does work for wiring, though that isn't why I bought it. Besides, after I got it, the wired LAN to the outbuilding started working so I didn't need it anyway.	1
Ran new Cat 6 cables in my home and tested with this tool,worked fine for what I wanted.	1
Works great to test custom made wires	1
We both 2 units. First unit, install 9 volt battery and test with a known good cat-5. both number 1 and 2 lights up, then skip number 2. One would think that I have a bad wire (not true). Both returned.	-1
Good tool at a good price.	1
Cant beat the price - its very rudimentary, but does everything its supposed to and does it fairly well.  CONS  - I have noticed one of the LED's in my unit is dimmer than the rest, but it still is visible and i still can see whether it is working. You get what you pay for	1
Great Product!	1
worked great	1
Very simple to use. Love it!	1
As a good, basic check of your crimped-on connection and the continuity of the lines, this tester does a good job.  That you keep the twisted pairs in their proper order on the connector, however, is up to the user.	1
For a simple, cheap tester, it worked perfect for me.  I was able to diagnose a problem I was having with one of my ethernet jacks.  Turned out to be a broken wire at the back of a keystone jack.	1
I would give it 5 stars but it showed that i had everything right, but the wire would not transfer data.	1
Works ok, I guess.  Hard to know if the cord is good.	1
works good, easy to use	1
If your looking for a cheaper way to move on the Y axis this is for you. Well built for the price and I recommend it for light to medium weight travel. It's threads give you enough vertical adjustment to move items relatively smoothly. If your tossing between a couple of lab jacks I tested 2 of them and work  good.	1
it is for sure stainless steel. only way to drill it is with diamond bits. cost me 2 bits for every hole made. best way to add a hole on a punch and die. but it can leave a small bend in metal if you don't watch it.to raise even faster and with no wearing out your hands get a stepper motor and a little drive motor to control it with some of them bearings and a rod to mount it to so it can raise with the lift.  hit me up if you would like better instructions.	1
Well made w/ good materials.  Smooth operation w/ little side-to-side movement of the platform as it is raised and lowered.  Some binding on lowering with light load on the platform.  Graphite lubricant on the jackscrew helped a lot!	1
Hasn't failed me yet. Hope you like 10k thermistors.	1
Very nice. Using it to drive a 24v relay with a toggle between heat and cool so I can use it on a window a/c that the thermostat died in during the summer, or a space heater during the winter.	1
I've bought several of these over time.  Works perfectly.	1
I built a small kegerator out of a 5 Cubic foot freezer.  It has worked great!  I was concerned about what state it would start in after a power outage so before using it for beer, I set it all up and unplugged it.  I left it unplugged for about 24 hours and when reconnected, it came back up in the same state as when I unplugged it (Running) and with the settings!  Perfect!  Very pleased!  As some people have mentioned, the wiring was not clear.  Just remember the COOL and HEAT sections only interupt the power, meaning you will need to run power in line with it, just like it was a light switch.	1
works great	1
The wire connectors in the back could definitely be beefier and spaced better. I used it to cycle an attic ventilation fan all summer with no problems. Be aware that if you have a power outage, the device reboots in a power-off state. You must press the power button to turn it on again. You wouldn't want to rely on this to control a freezer or something.	1
Mine arrived with the terminal block for the cold side wires completely disconnected. After putting slight pressure on the hot it also came free. They weren't soldered at all. Poor quality control to let that out. I love the idea of the Fahrenheit display, but not at the cost of quality.	-1
I could not get this to control my cooling fan.  I have a 240 volt version of this and it works well, could not get this one to function properly.	-1
Works well-programming a little confusing but an excellent price. Overtemp setpoints for my massive LED indoor hydroponic garden lights. I wonder if some of the poor reviews were either they didn't read the specs or wire it correctly and fried it. Seem rugged-i have 3 now	1
I like this controller! I like its functionality. BUT, I am on my second one with two failures  I use these to prevent my outdoor air compressor from starting when the ambient temperature drops below freezing and I only use the cooling side of the controller. The unit does a good job with that. The first one I purchased was the Centigrade only one. The controller worked well for many months but then the PC board mounted relay failed. The air compressor uses a 3.5 HP motor at 220 VAC and is rated at 15 amps. I use one leg of the 220 for control (not the best way, but simple) so the 10 amp rated relay only sees about 7.5 amps at 110 VAC.  Recently the V-belt failed on the compressor and when I replaced it and then restarted the compressor, that's when the relay on the controller let go with a bang. Go figure - Murphy got me. Maybe in-rush current but the compressor had been stopped and started many times before? I could have claimed a warranty replacement maybe but I was tired of converting Centigrade to Fahrenheit as I looked at it in my shop so I just purchased a new one that had a Fahrenheit readout.  As I was attaching the appropriate wires to the new unit, I noticed the PC board mounted connector seemed very loose when tightening the wires to it- very loose on the board. Interestingly it was the connector for the same relay (cooling) that had failed on the first controller. I didn't want to use it that way and didn't want to wait for a replacement. So I disassembled the controller and found that the connector had not had all of its pins soldered to the runs on the PC board because the connector itself was faulty and the solder pins were too short. Murphy again. How did he know I would get the board with that bad connector? To make what has been a long story shorter, I desoldered the connector from the first unit (before scrapping it) and after desoldering the bad connector on the new unit, resoldered the new connector to the board properly.  After reassembly the controller works fine but probably without warranty at this point. I don't know if I'm just unlucky but the two failures on two controllers makes me want to tell future purchasers to at least look the units over carefully before installation and keep the warranty info handy. Just saying.  Afterthought: When I inspected the first controller after disassembling it, the PC board was black at the relay in question but it was between the relay and the connector. I assumed it was the relay but didn't test it. Too late now- it's gone. It may have not been the relay that failed and might have been that the solder pins on the connector were not properly embedded as on the second unit and that was what caused the short circuit. If that is the case, while I won't change my rating for this controller because I don't know for sure what caused the problem, if it was a manufacturing defect on two out of two units, I would only give it one star.	1
Perfect	1
It meets my requirement, no need to do anything just use it for me. Thanks	1
Works great	1
Does the job just fine.	1
Works good, had to go on line to figuring out how to wire it in line	1
Has been keeping a cane toad nice and warm.	1
Works good but pay attention to the wiring chart.	1
I bought this temperature controller to regulate the temperature of chicken egg incubator.  I have it hooked up to two incandescent light bulbs, which heat air in a heating chamber as it passes by via a small fan.  I actually don't have any cooling system installed, so I should have chosen the heat only model, but this one works as well.  I haven't had a chance to hatch any eggs yet, but so far in my testing the thermostat has worked perfectly!  I like how the oscillation range can be adjusted.  It doesn't appear that this controller can "learn" when to turn the heat off to avoid overshoot of the set point like some more advanced models, but that's fine for my application.  The minimum range of temperature oscillation (off to on cycle) is 0.3C.  With my system, I observe a 0.4C oscillation because of a 0.1C overshoot on the heating cycle.  The relays are solenoid type, not solid state, as they audibly click every time they switch.  So I guess time will tell how durable the contacts are on the relays.  I'll update my review if something goes wrong with them.  By the way, several reviewers have commented on how difficult they found the wiring to be.  Don't be dismayed; the wiring is about as simple as wiring gets.  There is a diagram right on the back of the device, and additionally one in the instructions.  Follow it to a T, and you'll have no problems.	1
Thermostat is easy to set and quite accurate, the price is right, I have two and they work well.	1
Works very good for my application, adjustable temperature on/off separation	1
this little gem works great. I have an electric overhead heater that needed something a little more accurate to control temp than the standard farm grade thermostat. this worked perfectly.	1
I really like this controller.  My only two complaints are 1) When using Fahrenheit it is only controllable to the whole degree (easy fix, do the math and convert to Celsius) 2) The temperature probe is not accurate but as long as you are monitoring with thermometers its not really a problem.  I even bought a second one for a different incubator.	1
as described	1
works very well, easy to program	1
Good temperature controller.	1
Works great, easy to use and don't have to refer to the instructions anymore to change settings- always good in my book!	1
The controller works 5 star!  The bad review is because 1 day shipping took 4!  I would buy the controller again in a heartbeat, but don't count on 1 day shipping.	-1
good price and delivery	1
works great but the wiring instructions are def confusing, glad i have some exp in electronics	1
Thanks to the wiring diagram from the review of Robert J. Leonard, I was able to use this device hooked up to a heater as we have some lines to our outside instant water heater that would freeze in the cabinet around 15 degrees F (just move 7,8 from his diagram to 5,6).  I used an inexpensive 10' $6 1600W outdoor extension cord rather than going the AC outlet route seen in other reviews.  I like that the unit has a temperature calibration function as well (was 1 degree off vs old thermometer).  I'm knocking a star off since I needed to re-solder one the green parts that the wire screws down to the Printed Circuit Board (it came off when screwing the back plate cover back on; I did not want to wait for amazon to send another unit; connections on this PCB are large).  When I opened it up, I noticed that 2 of the other green wire connections to the PCB were a little loose and did not have enough solder on them either.  Since I already had my soldering iron out for the wires, it only delayed my completion by 10 minutes.  Once redone, the unit worked just fine.  In case you need to open the unit up: Take off the sliding orange holding clips. Pull back the top sticker off of the purple plastic area (it will re-stick back down). Stick a small flat head screwdriver on the sides to lift up purple plastic from gray case hook. Pull front out of casing.	1
Perfect temperature control for my project. Easy to wire after a bit of online research and carefully following the wiring diagram.	1
I home brew, and I use this to control the temperature in my fermenter.  It's easy to install and program.  I love the fact that you can select Farenheit or Celsius display (especially if you are metrically challenged.)  Remember this is a switch, and does not directly supply power to your application.  There are lots of on-line references how to connect and program these things, so do a little research before you buy one.	1
This seems to work very well.  It seemed to be accurate, right out of the box.  I like DIY projects, so I made this to control a heater.	1
These temperature controllers simply work great..	1
Very nice! Especially since you can choose between C and F.!!	1
works perfectly for controlling my kegarator temp	1
This is a great little package. My intended use is to replace the control panel in my Hayward pool heater. I had prices to replace the plastic panel, ranging from $450 to $880. Mind you, the control panel looks like it should be $50, and maybe $100 at the very most. This costs less than $20 and it uses the same 10K ohm NTC thermistor in the heater. I guess these prices are what you get when your dealing with someone making a years pay in four months. In future, my pool equipment will only be purchased from manufacturers that sell repair parts to the public. Hayward does not.	1
These don't stick as well as the Glue Dots for crafts. And that's the 1 star. Even worse, there are no where near 325 of these on a roll.  I used 40 last week and 65 last night. I'm nearing the end of the roll. Generously I'd say there are closer to 150 dots per roll. I do not like being deceived and/or lied to. Don't buy these tiny dots.	-1
Dimensionally accurate, however the unthreaded clearance holes are too small to pass a 3/8" bolt making it impossible to bolt these blocks together. Returned.	-1
I must have got a bad one. Smooths as course sandpaper. Case too small and battery dead. Will return.	-1
On first inspection, the cover that protects the AC power input and output terminals could not open due to interference with the housing. This made it impossible to attach power leads to controller.  Unable to repair so I took the cover off.  When I attached to the controller to the motor and power input it did not allow speed control.  The motor went from full stop to full speed as the knob was turned.  I hope to ret;urn for credit.	-1
The tubing itself is ok but the sizes are horrible.  I'm using it mostly for quadcopter builds and the green size is about the only one that fist most applications.  The other sizes are either way way too small or way too large.  Just not a good fit for quad builds.	-1
They could be made out of heavier material.	-1
Not thick enough	-1
First one worked fine but sadly melted within a week and almost started a fire. Pretty troubling. Replacement has been holding up fine. There definitely is no protection circuitry in this device.	-1
Nightmare! (as I affectionately call it) my wife doesn't want me to throw it away because I gave it a name.	-1
I haven't used these headers yet, but I'm sure they work fine.  But, please see the attached photograph of how the headers arrived.  I'm not a tree-hugger, but I think reasonable person would find this to be ridiculous.	-1
The purple filament comes out in fibers. Easy to break a print.	-1
I'll be honest, I don't think I'll be buying any more of this filament. I've been using hatchbox pla for the better part of a year and have been pretty happy with it. I am printing a very large item so I decided to try this filament because it was about $5 cheaper per roll and had pretty good reviews.  First try was with the exact same settings I've used with hatchbox for temp (215) and bed (50) no fan and I was getting severe shrinking and warping of the part. I had just printed the 4 of the same part with the last of my hatchbox filament without issue.  After much tinkering with the settings I've been able to reduce the shrinkage using 210 and 60 with the fan at 50% but I've never had warping like this with hatchbox. After lots of benchy testers and test cubes with various fan and retraction settings I've wasted a full spool trying to get a usable part out of my first roll. I don't think this stuff is for me and ordered two more spools of hatchbox.  Monoprice Maker Select v2 with microswiss upgrades  About the only good I can say about it is I liked the color.	-1
Good color, but there was a tangle almost immediately in the roll that messed up my printer. Please sort out the tangle issues and I will consider buying again	-1
The first roll I got works great "the true blue". But then I ordered this navy blue and it's a whole other story , I email "3D Solutech" a month ago and they said they would send me a replacement but to date received nothing.	-1
After applying the thinnest layer possible to my PLA prints, the coating felt extremely tacky even after several days.  It did not sand well at all.  The two bottles were also 15-20% empty when I received them.  Maybe I just got a bad batch?	-1
garbage product. I wish there were less branded epoxies that are claimed to be something else. This is just standard epoxy that company branded thinking that they are so smart. Moreover this stuff bubbles like crazy, I mixed it right and 2 days later it feels like hard rubber - I can still dip my nail into i a little. Not the finish I was looking for. Sanding is is a nightmare, very rubbery when dried. Totally not worth it imo. if you are willing to sand the part, you mind as well not cover it with anything at all. Sanding gives you the best possible finish in fact. It also does not lay smooth, cheapest foam brush provided does not do the job right - creates ton of bubbles.  Bottom line is this "invention" is a total fail and misery. Do not be fooled with such low-brained products.	-1
Blotches out on plastic. Not impressed at all. Does not set as advertised	-1
Hard to find a quality pen light for patient use, and I hoped these would be of decent quality. Only one worked, and yes I tried new batteries.	-1
too hard to use, doesn't flow well at all, you have to use a putty knife, there are better products.	-1
Bah, Humbug!  This is not what I expected when ordering the blanket.  The heat generated is minimal, although I did not expect it to get "hot".  Unless you are prepared to keep this running 24/7, all winter long, it is of little use.  In 35 degree temperatures, I could see little difference in our grill's performance because I turned the blanket on about one hour before grilling time.  Perhaps if it were left on permanently it would have brought better results, but I have no desire to add to my already high electric bill.  It is less expensive to have my tanks refilled than to run a power blanket all day, every day, when we might cook out 2 times a week in the winter.  The short cord is definitely a drawback as we have no ground level outlets and it has to plugged into an outlet on the patio wall.  With a grill cover in place even a 6 ft extension cord isn't long enough for us.  We will leave it on the tank and try turning it on the night before we plan to grill.  Not a superior idea...for us.	-1
The hose is low quality,spongy,came in a the roll and was flatened out,after rolled out it still was flat	-1
Unlike others I received the correct 3/8 hose BUT this stuff is GARBAGE.  I flushed my lines before hooking up my new carb and even with gas just flowing through this line ( NO pressure or sitting in line at all ) this line turned the gas BROWN.. there is no way anyone can tell me that poluting gas with whatever is turning it brown in the line is good for jets or injectors SEE PICTURE.  I sent this back , got line from the local parts store and my gas is now crystal clear.  I am so glad I thought to flush the line AND use a glass filter to catch anything in there and actually see what was flowing through. I will NEVER use a Thermoid product again	-1
Same as the 3/8 I bough here on amazon.  I flushed my lines before hooking up my new carb and even with gas just flowing through this line ( NO pressure or sitting in line at all ) this line turned the gas BROWN.. there is no way anyone can tell me that poluting gas with whatever is turning it brown in the line is good for jets or injectors. I sent this back , got line from the local parts store and my gas is now crystal clear.  I am so glad I thought to flush the line AND use a glass filter to catch anything in there and LOOK at what was flowing through the lines.  I will NEVER use a Thermoid product again  I put pictures of this here on Amazon but for some reason Amazon is not posting them ?	-1
This my first PETG spool after using successfully countless PLA and ABS spools. It is supposed to be easier to print than ABS but not for me. It extrudes nicely when loading the filament but results was not as clean as ABS and PLA, e.g. the top layer rather than being smooth is buggy  and very rough. I was printing with FlashForge creator pro, PEI bed, Micro Swiss 0.4mm nozzle and tried a wide temperatures ranges (up to 250C nozzle) with and without material cooling and with printer fully covered or open.  This was disappointing and whatever left from the spool will go to the trash.  I presume that this product is not worse than other PETG filaments, just that PETG and me are incompatible.	-1
UPDATE: While this VG *used* to be made from coconut oil (when I gave it 5 stars originally) they switched to palm oil in 2015-2016. So I switched to Duda VG, made from 100% soybean oil and it blew ED out of the water. ED also makes soy-based VG now, but at the time I was looking to replenish my supply (about a year ago) they only offered it in 4-gallon packs. Everything else was palm-based based. That's when I found Duda VG. And I'm never going back. Priced as good as ED and can buy it in 1g quantities. I really like soy VG, even over coconut VG, and it's much more sustainable as well (even than coconut). Never going back!  Essential Depot VG is the best, bar none. Made from coconut oil, never animal fat. Tastes delicious, always fresh, and vapes like a dream. Can't beat it. Once you try Essential Depot VG you will never buy anything else.	-1
This is a piece of crap. It worked once and only once. Don't waste your money	-1
cracked 1st time out of the box, crap	-1
Did not work on stainless steal, even with a smaller hole already drilled out.	-1
Save your money, this has got to be the biggest piece of crap I have ever bought.  The resistors, capacitors, and jumpers will not even stay in the breadboard, if you just slightly touch them the either make or break contact. The only good thing about this kit is the power supply that comes with the kit.	-1
Thin junk with glass impurities and bubbles in the glass.  Returned it and went with Pyrex for a few more dollars and I am glad I did.	-1
Liars in listing. Item is labeled 200lb capacity. Not 500lb. This thing is a toy.	-1
Not what I expected! Too small! I didn't read the specs before I bought it. Used it once to move bags of winter ice remover granules!	-1
They load you up on small to extra extra tiny tubes. not enough tubes for wire sizes used in the real world.. Tossed 1/2 the tubes trash. they were useless. Ive never seem wires so small with shrink wrap on them..	-1
Had one of the three defective, won't return a valid temp, even though I can see it on the bus.  All of the money I paid was 100% top quality.  Cannot be bothered to return them, I already used the other two.	-1
So far not so good quality. The very first heater burned out right away. I'm on the second in the set. It all others work well I will upgrade the rating. Hopefully, this may take some time.	-1
When I ordered these (April 2015 - 1.5 years ago), I only needed 4, but figured a spare would be good to have around.  Well, tonight I needed another stepped for a project.  Since I had the extra one I figured I was set.  However, when I opened the box with the motor (was still factor sealed), I discovered it was not an 84oz motor, but a smaller one.  I double checked the label on the individual boxes and they were all the same.  Some one had just packed the wrong motor type in the box.	-1

Warps after a short while and renders your print bed unprintable	-1
These do not help. Easily shatterable too, so watch out for getting cut on those glass fragments.	-1
Overpriced hunk of unspecial glass.	-1
After constant struggles for nearly a year to level the print bed, I finally found the culprit. This borosilicate glass was not flat.	-1
It looks like every seller here sources their borosilicate glass from the same poor manufacturer. I ordered this to replace a warped sheet only to find out this piece is far more warped than my other one.  The kicker? I already installed my PEI sheet on this so I'm out a lot more than just the cost of this glass.	-1
Not sure what people like about this. 1. It's WAY smaller than advertised. It's about 180 mm x180mm. 2. NOTHING EVER STICKS TO IT. Unless you use other products (glue/hairspray) I tried about 30 prints in the last 24 hours and have barely made it with one successful print.	-1
I purchased two of these.  Neither were warped, but after about a days use with the heat bed set at 60 degrees I noticed the the  first layer wasn't even even though I have a BLTouch sensor.  After hours of work I removed the glass and noticed it was visibly warped so I put the 2nd one on the bed which it warped as well.  Pretty upset over this.	-1
I purchased this for a Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus (200x200mm build surface) Mine came ever so slightly warped. You won't notice if you just look at it but non of my prints would stick after just 2-3 layers even with glue sticks, tape, and hair spray (hesitant to drop $25 on kapton tape). Upon closer inspection the nozzle  was actually knocking my prints off the surface when it reached a certain point! I checked that area with a micrometer and it was about 0.06mm higher than the edges.  Buy cheap, buy twice I guess. I am out filament and a build surface for my printer now. I'd recommend just getting some buildtak.	-1
junk, printouts would not adhere to the glass, even when using hairspray like recommended.	-1
Bought this a couple months ago and it worked great but over the last week I noticed I couldn't get a good print of my Monoprice Maker Select. I couldn't seem to get the bed level. I then noticed that the two opposite corners of the glass were high. I took the glass off and checked the glass and found that it had warped in the middle. I took the glass off the printer, reset the printer to use the standard bed and leveled it. I tried printing a Benchy and it printed fine. Not sure why a piece of borosilicate glass that hasn't been used that much would deform but I would think is should last longer and be more solid. I only print PLA so 60C is the hotest it gets.	-1
Warped!	-1
Arrived with a scratch. Not a crack, a scratch.  Luckily I'm not using it for anything that requires total smoothness, but glass isn't supposed to be smooth "when you get lucky," it's main use as a horizontal surface is that it is 100% flat and without fault.  Fail.	-1
I have a couple pieces of glass for my 3d printer and needed another. This piece is 3.2mm thick and not 3mm as advertised. You wouldn't think that this is a big deal, but when you are using a 0.4mm nozzle. Suddenly, this makes a night and day difference in the first layer. All the other pieces from other suppliers I have are dead on 3mm or undersized by 0.02mm. For the high volume of glass produced and the application, I would think the tolerances would be tighter.	-1
I purchased two of these borosilicate glass pieces to use as a printing bed for my Monoprice Maker Select IIIP 3d printer (identical build to the Wanhao Duplicator i3.) The pieces arrived promptly and well packaged with no damage. The size is perfect for my bed - not quite square to allow for the screws that are used for bed leveling.  I installed using a silicone thermal pad&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/400mm-x-205mm-x-0-5mm-Silicone-Thermal-Pad-for-CPU-GPU-Heatsink/dp/B007PPEW52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">400mm x 205mm x 0.5mm Silicone Thermal Pad for CPU GPU Heatsink</a>&nbsp;and installation was quick and easy.  The glass was smooth and defect free and well cut.  Initially, everything printed perfectly and adhesion, using Aquanet hairspray, was perfect. But within a week of use, I began having bed leveling issues. It took me a while to even consider that the glass might be warped but sure enough, when I place straightedges on the glass, it has warped up in the center.  I likely wouldn't have left a 1 star review except that I see from other reviewers that this is a common issue. I would hope that Signstek would reach out to all who have this issue and even more importantly, resolve whatever issue there is in the product itself that causes the warping. Now I'm left trying to decide whether to install the second, unused piece I ordered and risk the same issue (and wasting another piece of silicone thermal bed) or to cut my losses and order from a different supplier.  Update: I did decide to install the second glass plate I bought from Signstek. Fortunately, the warped plate was very easy to remove from the silicone pad and I was able to re-use it with the second glass plate. This new plate is flat and un-warped, just as the first one was initially. I will update in a few weeks to report whether or not the second piece also warps. If it doesn't, I will revise my star rating to reflect that not all of the plates from Signstek warp.  UPDATE: As of 2/6/2016, the second plate remains flat and unwarped. So that means that only half of the glass I bought from Signstek warped - 1 out of 2. I upped my star rating to 2 stars because the glass is well cut and the edges nicely smoothed and the second piece remains flat. I really hope that Signstek is able to implement better quality control because the reviews indicate that they have a significant number of plates that warped and make them 100% unsuitable for the purpose they are sold for.  I really cannot give it higher than 2 stars since 50% of my purchase was defective and Signstek has not reached out to me or most of the customers mentioning this in their reviews (only one that I can tell.) Although I'm very pleased with the Signstek plate that I have currently installed, there is no way to assure that a customer gets a good piece of glass so I couldn't recommend this glass at this time.	-1
Good quality, perfectly flat. With a couple of layers of Aqua Net hair spray gets the job done perfectly for both PLA and ABS. No sharp edges.  UPDATE: After several weeks of use each both glass plates warped and became unusable.  UPDATE 2: Tried to contact Signstek customer service at jenny@signswise.com. No response. Downgrading the rating to single star.	-1
I'm using this for my Prusa i3. The glass is thicker on the center which makes bed leveling impossible. The edge of larger prints always peels up. :(	-1
Only 1 star, very thin and super small finger area	-1
In comparing these to the 7 mil gloves from Harbor Freight that I normally buy, I've had more tears with these 9 mil gloves, and they feel thinner than Harbor Freight's 7 mil. The price isn't really any different (assuming HF coupon.) I've also noticed the price has gone up more than a dollar since I bought these just a few weeks ago, making them even less of a value. The Harbor Freight 9 mil gloves are significantly better than these and are likely worth the extra cost.  I've never had so many tears; they're fine for working with epoxy/paint, but are not up to the task of actually working on anything with your hands. I actually had a pair tear just while I was just laying out fiberglass cloth.  I'm at a loss to explain how these gloves have so many 5 star reviews.	-1
OK after seeing all the 5 star review I decided to buy this material to put it to test and it failed miserably I could not print 1 single thing from simple to complicated trying every single temperature settings that possible, I even followed some of the reviews advises and nothing worked. I don't advise this material for 3d printing unless you are really really have extra 20 dollars you want to waste.	-1
In my experience the material is not as strong as other users report. Parts show various degree of delamination between layers, expecially on transitions from solid to less than 100% infill (eg around top and bottom surfaces). Object can be pulled apart with bare fingers pretty easily. Tried temperatures from 240C to 260C, flow rate from 95% to 115% and speeds from 20mm/sec to 50mm/sec. The strongest (yet not as strong as PETG or ABS) results have been achieved at slowest speeds, 260C. Maybe I've got a bad batch, as others seem to be reporting better results with this material.	-1
I didn't get good lamination. Prints came out very stringy. Looks like I need to print hotter, but without an all metal tool path I'm hesitant. Also, LOTS of water uptake! First two prints went real well. I left it out over night (which I do with my PET and PLA), and the next day, hissing and spitting as it went into the hotend.	-1
Does not stick as well as I thought it should peels off most things with little effort	-1
If only it were PLA and not freaking ABS....which it was....twice.	-1
Unusable filament  The first 2 prints I ran failed in minutes. The next small print I ran at 20mm/s (half the speed I run my other filaments at) was successful and I would have been fine if the only drawback was just having to print everything at half speed, but then the next print failed and I couldn't get anything to come out of my extruder after that, even at 230c. At first glance, the spool just looked like it was badly wound, but with a closer look, I can see bits of junk mixed in with the filament and the diameter varies wildly. I don't see how the spools I normally print have been tangle & junk-free in the dozens of spools I've used up, yet this for $2 less can't go 5 meters without a jam.  This picture shows the bits of junk and bulges from just one section of the spool.	-1
This temp gun apparently did not receive any testing (QC) before leaving factory. Installed new battery and unit would not come on when I replaced the cover. With the cover off, it would work intermittently. Had to return it.	-1
after about 6 uses,  it didn't work any more.  changed the battery , still nothing.  i threw it in the garbage	-1
What was I expecting for $15? I love kitchen tools and gadgets, and this unfortunately falls in the gadget category. I installed the provided "Rocket" brand 9V battery, which was, of course, dead, then installed a fresh 9V battery I had on hand. Ta-da, it works, kind of. The instruction sheet is in Engrish. I fiddled with the tiny buttons inside the battery compartment and eventually figured out how to turn the laser on, at least I saw a red dot.  I bought this to measure the surface temperature of my Lodge cast iron griddle. I know which gas range settings produce cooked-but-not-carbonized pancakes and I was curious just what temperature that was. I'd read that the "Leidenfrost" effect, that "dancing, skittering" water effect happened when the temperature is correct, but honestly I've never seen it happen. Recipes I'd looked up today said that 375F was the ideal temperature for pancakes, and sure enough that was about the setting I had on the range anyway.  The readings from this thing were... interesting. I certainly wouldn't rely on it for much of anything important. Fortunately pancakes are not a life-or-death situation.  If you want a non-contact thermometer and you're too cheap to spring for a real one, try this thing. I feel kind of dumb having spent even $15 on it -- what was I expecting? The laser is there just as a "sight" as they specify, it's an IR thermometer. You know what? It's an amusing toy for the kitchen gadget fan. Maybe I'll buy a real non-contact thermometer one of these days. But this is fun to play with in the meantime. Don't expect much and you won't be too disappointed.  ---  This thermometer DOES seem to be accurate, but it's a little finicky. The more I use it, the better I like it. And it *was* a bargain.	-1
I purchased this thermometer and tested it when I received it.  Worked fine, seemed to be pretty accurate.  I then put it in a drawer until I needed it again.  About about a month, I retrieved said device and it would not turn on.  The battery tested good and I tried a brand new battery in it.  Still no luck.  I contacted HDE about this issue and this is their response:  "Hello,  Thank you for contacting HDE. Unfortunately our return policy is the only warranty for this item. Unfortunately we will not be able to assist with a replacement/refund.  Thank you  HDE"  So, now I have a paperweight that used to take temperatures.  You may be luckier than I.  Caveat emptor.	-1
Although I used this device on it's highest settings 3X per day, tarter buildup was noticable over hand brushing.	-1
I hate it. The #10 adapter broke during my very first rivet. I have no intentions of trying any of the other pieces. Into the trash it goes.	-1
SUCKS	-1
Warped badly.  There needs to be a disclaimer in the description stating that these plates have a good chance of not being flat.	-1
This very cheap small emitter package includes  Laser Diode crystal with current limiting resistor and collimating lens. It serves a purpose of introduction Laser enthusiast, I think, into the World of Photonics. The diode is not sealed, it exposed to atmosphere, wet or dry,  dusty, indeed in usual home environment. The quality of the source is very poor. And the emitting power is low. It is also very sensitive to static electrical discharges. Can not recommend it, it causes a lot of frustration.	-1
They are well priced, not bright or focused very well. Good for tinkering, not so good if you have a specific goal in mind	-1
Very difficult to change spool, entire assembly has to come apart. I decided to print my own with 608 bearings.	-1
This is a flimsy reel holder you will need to superglue the ends where the knobs screw into the bar. Mine kept on falling out and it was a real pain. After supergluing the ends into the bar it works much better. I guess I could have spent more to get a better product.	-1
Don't buy. Rubber feet for the bottom are so old they are dry rotted and fall apart. There are plenty of holders you can make on your printer for free.	-1
It's really common for the axle to come apart. With a new spool I get a lot of tangles around the axle. A spool holder where the spool sits on top of bearings is a better option IMO.	-1
Missing the roller for the spool	-1
It's hard to understand why products like this are so badly designed and still so positively reviewed.  A holder like this is only appropriate for loose filament.  If you put an actual spool with 1kg worth of plastic onto the spindle, which is barely suitable for dispensing toilet paper, it doesn't roll across the spindle: it drags its way across it.  Your extruder has enough work to do without trying to drag 1kg of plastic around a toilet paper holder.  If you have a tangle in your spool, this will wind up tightening it until you get a jam.  The solution is to replace the spindle with ball-bearing (or printed gear bearing) supported cones which press into a spool, such that it is *only* supported by the bearings.  Once you do that, the filament spool will rotate freely enough to overshoot and possibly oscillate a little (mine oscillates a little when my x-carriage moves), which will help loosen up tangles you may run into.  I have not run into any tangles after this mod across a wide variety of filament.  Essentially, tangles are a result of bad spool management -- it is a physical fact every spool *will* have some level of tangle in it, yet everyone blames the filament and praises trash products like these.	-1
Worked great...for about 10 seconds. Installed the sensor, used a 5v source, and began use at about 200psi. The sensor reported as expected for about 10 seconds, then went to 0. Now the sensor reads 0-.5v constantly.  I should have listened to the other reviews.	-1
could not get it to give anything but a few mv "wiggle" on my scope.  no instructions, no schematic, no warnlngs, polarity indicators etc.  not happy!	-1
Once I realized I just bought a seventeen dollar tube of manuka honey when I have two ten dollar jars that have thirty times this amount in them? Yeah, I wasn't happy. I put this on and it struck me that it had the same consistency and smell as the manuka (same thing in this!) honey I'd been using, I felt like I'd been conned by a traveling medicine man in a wagon selling tonic. There is nothing else in this to help. I even tasted it to be sure, Yep! Honey. So I feel really duped right now by people pouring honey in a medicinal tube. Ugh!	-1
Cheaper at sears!!!! And all craftsman tools are are made in china now. I took a old ratchet that has made in usa stamped on the handle back to be fixed and the girl at the counter didn't know how to change the gear out so she walked over and pulled a new ratchet off the shelf and said here you go. The new craftsman ratchet says made in china. I told her to find someone else that can fix my old ratchet as I didn't want made in china tools. She told me that all craftsman tools are being made in china, said they still have some old stock of USA tools but you have to search the shelves for them. Also showed me that the box of gears to fix the ratchets is made in china. So craftsman is no longer a USA brand!!!!	-1
WARNING - 220V.  The product description makes not mention that this unit is shipped with a 220V cord only.  Nor dose the box label any kind of input voltage requirement(s).	-1
These look and feel fine, but the right angled one spun in the handle on first use and the quality of the steel is a bit questionable.  A bit too soft in my opinion. It's a fine line between have it be too hard and snapping and too soft and bending, but I think they made the call too far in the soft/malleable direction. The handle spinning issue is a design problem as the shafts don't really have any features other than some subtle knurling on them to engage with the plastic of the handle.  I think these would be fine for casual use where you will not be applying rotational force to the handle, and for applications where you are not counting on stiffness of the sharp end of the tool.	-1
This is the worst Gaffers tape I have ever used. Won't stick to carpet at all, comes loose within minutes.	-1
I accidentally bought this for my Da Vinci Jr Printer.  When it arrived I noticed that the spool is the same size, so I opened the plastic cartridge and swapped it with my old spool.  Turns out that XYZprinting uses an NFC chip in their spools to force you to use their crappy PLA.  To make a long story short I could not even use their crappy PLA in their printer because it had a different chip.  Oh well.  I have since become fed up with the whole thing and tossed the printer into the recycle bin as well as the unusable PLA.  I ordered a new printer today from a different company after confirming that they do not chip their PLA spools.  Perhaps if XYZprinting spent less money on NFC chips they could make better printers, software, and PLA that you would want to buy.	-1
Cheap price, cheap grommets.  Most of the grommets are not correct dimensions listed as per digital calipers and my drill bits.  Either slightly large or slightly small, with 1/8 inch bit increments.  Ridiculous.  Also, the inside of the grommets are not the same size on both sides of the grommet; it has a taper.  On one side it seals up tight, the other side it has a gap all the way around the material it encompasses.  The grommet holes are not smooth; they are covered in pieces of rubber like a dull drill bit was spinning in it.  Have to use a razor knife to clean them off.  Overall, these will work if you don't need quality grommets or ones that seal up tightly.  It is somewhat my fault for ordering budge grommets and expecting decent quality, but wow, these things weren't manufactured correctly don't fit right.  2 stars instead of 1 because they are indeed rubber grommets and they would work fine for school projects or similar.	-1
Perhaps I received a bad spool?  i have the green variant and it's been printing super in my MP Select Mini v1.  but this black on is a piece of crap. it's stringing all over the place, layering isn't as good as the green one.	-1
******* UPDATE ********* Granted, you probably want to use up your filament as quickly as possible, but reality is, filament gets used when it gets used.  This update is to state that this roll of filament is starting to get used more.  The roll is now about 60-75% used up and the filament cracks and snaps on its own.  Meaning, it either becomes brittle as time goes by or the filament is really rigid and holds more of a more aggressive arc towards the center of the spool than the outer layers and is under a lot of tension when stretched to the print-head.  I'm not reducing stars for this update, but rest assured, this will be my last roll of this filament. ****************************  I really wanted to like this filament.  That statement sounds so cliche, but here's why.  It's really not because I've known great things about this filament or the company was started by a family friend or anything like that.  In fact, none of those are true.  I really wanted to like this filament because "for the most part", PLA is PLA across the board and... I ran out of black.  Each one has its own quirks, but this filament... it puts on a whole freak show on its own.  The other reason why I really wanted to like this filament is because I'm currently working on a prototype quad and I'm printing arms right now.  I just printed the fronts in Makerbot White, and as the fronts were still warm off the printer, the Repko Black arrives and I start printing the rear arms.  So, it's mostly due to excitement about getting all the arms printed and I can start getting the electronics together.  Let's just say, I spent practically a whole day printing the rear arms and they are still not printed.  So, the printer had been running all night and all day, without changing slicer settings or anything.  Models were not changed and when I switch to the Repko filament, production comes to a stop.  As far as design and printing experience goes, I'm no noob.  As far as filaments go, I'm somewhat of a noob, since experimenting with everything out there is just not financially viable for people who are not sponsored or evaluators (for free) in some way or form.  I have tried filament from several companies such as Makerbot, Hatchbox, Paradym, and a few others.  So again, as far as I see it, "for the most part", PLA is PLA.  I have a Makerbot 5th Generation and... as much as I also would like to say I love it, I've had to gut it and rebuild it to make it reliable.  That has nothing to do with the filament, just that I've stabilized the platform where any irregularities are not coming from the printer.  I normally leave my extruder temperature to 210-215c and most PLA will do just fine and go up and down 5c depending on how things go is about all that is needed.  I pretty much leave my extrusion ratio at about 1.05 and every PLA flows great.  Now, I do know the difference between new PLA and old, neglected PLA.  Yes, the popping and the steam coming out of the nozzle are present with old PLA.  You also have to bump up the extrusion ratio just a bit also.  There is no steaming or popping coming from this PLA so it's pretty fresh.  Now for the guts of the review.  This PLA doesn't have enough pigment in it.  Whatever the extruder is able to lay down on the print bed is very translucent.  Layer height maybe?  No.  I'm working on a prototype so the layers are nice and thick at 0.4mm x 0.3mm layer height.  The filament shouldn't be this translucent.  "Give it a couple layers" you say?  I like to print 3 top and bottom layers and 3 shells.  After about 5 layers at 0.3mm, it's still pretty translucent.  I'm not really a fan of the Makerbot filament because it is pretty finicky when it starts getting old, but I'll say this about the Makerbot filament: I can print down a single layer at 0.1mm layer height with a 0.2mm nozzle and the filament is SOLID black.  I didn't go with Makerbot filament because it's pretty expensive for what it is.  The other factor I'd like to review is the extrusion ratio.  Most PLA I put through my extruder is extruded at 1.05.  This filament extrudes hair-thin at 1.05.  I bumped it to 1.15.  Same thing.  Ok, without betting too redundant, I eventually bumped it to 1.75 and it's still under-extruding and still very translucent.  The print failed at 1.75 @ 210c by the way.  I read a review on another black PLA (I forget which one) but the reviewer said, "The filament is a little on the thin side (1.72mm) but you aren't getting less PLA.  A kg is a kg, so you're getting more lineage."  I totally agree with this.  Apply this statement here and the same is true that a kg is a kg.  However, if you have to almost double your extrusion ratio to get it to extrude the proper amount of filament, then this becomes a pretty expensive filament.  One reviewer here said this filament prints best at 210c.  I set my extruder to 210c and the same thing happens.  Not to take away credit or perhaps 210c worked well on his printer, but I was ALMOST able to get adequate extrusion at 1.25 @ 220c.  It's still translucent and under extruded but it's the best setting that I can get from this filament so far.  I believe this filament has a density-consistency issues - maybe.  On the positive side, the filament was nicely vacuum sealed and I was a bit sad that there was no silica gel pack.  Well, I found it.  It was stuffed on the inside of the spool, so that's nice.  Well, I really wanted to like this filament, and I like the idea of giving less-known brands a shot instead of giving all my money to the top brands, but I guess like they say, "stick with name brands".	-1
I checked the vendor's web site and they don't sell this item  directly.  I wonder why.  Is this old stock unsuitable for a "real" lab, which is more likely to order directly from the vendor?  I checked with a friend who is a lab scientist and he says that this type of product has an expiration date and specific storage requirements.  Neither are provided here.  I would not order here if I really needed a reliable result until this is addressed.	-1
I had posted a favorable review after owning this for a number of weeks....but over time it has become too problematic.  1.  The first one I ordered encountered a head clog that just could not be fixed. (I was on the phone with the tech support for a LONG time until he said to return it as they wanted to learn from what was going on -"evaluation")  They told me to deal with them on the return not with Amazon so I did and it cost me some shipping money.  I liked the machine and the customer service but was disappointed in re-boxing a new machine.  2. Without going into a lot of needless detail the "heated bed" is problematic.  I replaced it three times.  I was about to replace it a fourth when diagnostics told me it was wiring this time.....not the bed dying as before.  Working with customer service (they are good) I tested resistance on the board and narrowed the problem down to a wire that is sent down a moving track (design flaw in my opinion).  Cannot get to it so major disassembly would be required .... and it may wear again even with replacement.  It was out of warranty so now I use it to make crappy prints with glue stick on the bed.  Ok for toys.  I would not recommend this printer.  Next to it I have a $400 QIDI that outperforms the Lul in speed, print quality and overall quality.  The Lulzbot had too many failures.  In some cases I was able to "jerry rig" the printer and print up parts that had failed.  That was ok.  But overall the price is too high now compared to other printers and too many problems with the bed itself (cracking, failing, wire routing,etc) being one I have spent many hours on.	-1
Horrible. They all look the same in and out of acidic substances. Didn't work. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Get the good, little more expensive strips.	-1
Did not work for me. Gave the same reading each time. The yellow paper is hard to read.	-1
In comparison to two different electric meters and SEOH's colorPHAst testing strips, these strips, over 25 separate tests, never came closer than 2 full points off in erroneous readings, usually reading as being more acidic than the liquid being tested actually was.	-1
not so hot, I'd get the liquid ph instead these are innacurate	-1
Garbage, NOT accurate	-1
I purchased these for my son's science project and ended up tossing them in favor of a digital meter.  I'm not sure if I just got a bad set or not, but these were not accurate in the least bit.  Not recommended.	-1
Sure the price is great but these are not great at all... They have a very low quality feeling to them and there is an issue I've noticed; where sometimes they light ok but then other times only a small box about a 1/2" x 1/2" lights up. Ok for small utility light but beyond that, I'd go with something else.	-1
I almost exclusively use IC3D for ABS filament so I figured I'd switch to them for PLA. I don't know if I got a bad spool or what, but it's way more brittle and doesn't print as well as the brand I usually use. I've also encountered a few snags while printing. Usually it works itself out but three hours into a print it didn't and ended up breaking because it was so brittle.	-1
Oh god were do I begin. I only tried PLA 3mm I wanted to try ABS but now with the bad results I got I don't have the motivation, I am going to review this filament on my Youtube channel and live print and compare it with other PLA as well but for here this is my review: 1. its inconsistant with its diameter, the tolerance of error is very large it can go from 2.90mm to 3.5mm at times, I hardly had consistency with this PLA. 2. it does not print good quality and warp as if it was ABS, I found that weird but I have pictures to back me up. 3. it variate very quickly to temperature change, I usually set 210 for PLA and this brand either don't flow good less than 205 or at 210 it start stringing.  I printed examples, 2 different brands, white is IC3D and Green is ColorFabb and you can judge for your self I don't advise you buy this PLA its expensive for the bad quality. and it causes jam in my printer and I have pictures of that as well	-1
Let me start this by saying I use a high volume of filament for my business. Because of this I have tested many different brands of filament to attempt to find "the one" perfect filament. I saw IC3D's filament as a good American made product that I could stand behind. That is, until I got it in the mail  Right off the bat, the filament was sealed in the box, but I noticed inside the wrapping the spool was covered with dust. Dust and a 200+C hotend do not mix. So I took the spool and blew it out with compressed air next to my HEPA filter to keep it from blowing around the room, and decided to give it a shot...  Don't ask me how they achieved this, but when I print with this black there are spots of matte finish, and spots of gloss. I have never in my 3D printing career seen this happen with even the cheapest Chinese filaments. Also the dimensional accuracy is definitely out of spec on both of the rolls I purchased, which makes my Ultimaker 2+ very cranky and constant adjustment of the filament feeder is needed.  So, aside from the jams, the patchy finish, and poor QC, this filament is almost as good as the chinese equivalent, and costs 50% more! What a bargain...needless to say, I will not be purchasing from IC3D again. Use at your own risk	-1
Product description for the White 1.75mm PLA is a lie. The tolerance for the filament is not +/- 0.03mm. It's .1mm... I would never have bought it if I knew that. The filament is oval shaped as well. 1.72mm one side, 1.78mm the other end. I bought this in April and haven't used it until today. I didn't think I needed to double check since the reviews where so good, but I guess we got to double check everything.	-1
More expensive because it claims to be a superior product... well that's just baloney!  Came factory sealed with a a humidity card showing over 40% and printed poorly at all temperatures that I tried: 190c, 200c, 210c and 220c.  I experienced low bed adhesion using multiple strategies, stringy prints with low layer adhesion.  If that isn't bad enough, the roll was obviously poorly wound leading to one snag (1 is too many).  Seriously, I have used many brands of filament and this is the worst I have experienced.  I get great prints using Hatchbox, USAfilament, Ninjaflex, Polyflex and I print mostly ABS and PLA but this PLA is simply unworkable.  Based on other reviews (and there aren't many) perhaps this roll is an anomaly, but I'm not going to try another one to find out!	-1
This is a nice assortment, with a decent overall quantity for the price (I paid <$14 for it). My biggest issue is that this filament seems to expand slightly while being heated. I'm using it with a 3D pen, and each and every time after I stop the pen, about .75" slowly extrudes from the tip accompanied by a popping sound (see picture). I confirmed it happening with 5 of 5 colors I have used so far. I went back to the samples included in the pen kit and they did not have the same issue. The actual waste is minimal, as it's not 3/4" of the stock material, but of the reduced diameter of the nozzel, but it is annoying and adds time to the process. I will probably try another manufacturer if I can find a similar price.	-1
I have used Hatchbox filament in the full rolls and have not had an issue but this sample pack is junk unless you just want it to see what the colors look like.  All of the samples I have tried to print with have been very brittle (break with slightest bend) and just don't print well, all 12 colors were loose coils of filament stuck in a zip-lock type bag.  I get the feeling that Hatchbox (or the seller) is taking returned spools of filament and cutting them into 20 foot lengths and selling as samples meaning you are not getting fresh filament and likely getting filament that has some kind of issue like being "stale".  This is a shame as there are times I would like to add a specific color to a small project and don't want an entire 2 pound (1 Kg) spool that will not get used before it goes bad, even a 1 pound spool can sometimes be too much if you can even find the color you want in the smaller spool.  I may be asking too much here as this is labeled as 3D pen filament and I am trying to use it in a printer but I fail to see how that is any different than printer filament other than it is not on a huge roll.	-1
Theses are okay for the special spice that I paid in order to write this review.  The biggest problem with these is the color code markings are incorrect on over half of them.  The values on the paper tags that separate each value is correct though.  But don't go by the color markings. I noticed this when putting them away along side my older stock.  So I got out my Fluke meter and began to verify them.  The values were spot on according to the tags at least.	-1
These are not okay.  The bottle caps do not screw on evenly and the oriface reducers do not fit tightly.  I thought they may be okay for working on new blends.  I was sorely disappointed. The cap did not seal enough to hold the oils in. They are missing the inserts in the caps that prevent leaking. I discovered this when two laying on their side leaked out.  I won't be buying this brand again.	-1
I've got to say, I agree with the review by  " Amazon Customer 'Test pilot geek"' on January 25, 2015.  It is amazing looking at the reviews that have been coming in on this thing daily which are 4 and 5 stars.  Very few are verified purchasers. A few months ago this product was rated at like 2.5 stars if that....just look at it now....these fake, mostly non-substantive reviews have made it look like the greatest 3D printer on earth, despite the pathetic print volume and many other technical issues with it.  Remember, it costs money for people to have fake reviews written like these, something is not right here!	-1
I didn't bought this printer as I saw it at my friend, its horrible and expensive, I got flashforge creator pro instead and my friend is jealous and mine was only $1300 and I get better print quality than him.	-1
I have a two year old Replicator 2 which has served me well; not without issues with the feeder and some Makerware hiccups- but overall it has been very solid.  With almost 1000 hrs of print time, it seemed like a good time to look for its replacement, since I assumed technology has advanced.  While reading the reviews of the Makerbot 5th gen, a very disturbing trend emerged.  One third of the five star reviews occurred on just a single day (10/14/2014)- while not one day of one-star reviews- of which there are twice as many- had two reviews.  Similarly, the positive reviews were brief, and often by Amazon users with no or very few other reviews, opposite of the one star reviews. I created a chart (hopefully it makes it through) to show the distribution of 1 and 5 star reviews by date- it speaks for itself.  Draw your own conclusions- but I'm staying clear of this product.  UPDATE: I initially only looked at five-star reviews for "tampering"- but the four-stars are off as well.  3 of the 8 four-star reviews were done on Oct 22nd (the same day as two five-stars), and 1 of the 8 four-stars was on the same day as the ridiculous "big day" (Oct 14th, 2014) for five-star reviews.  That almost definitely makes many (most?) positive reviews false.  If the suspicious four and five star reviews are discounted, the 5th Gen gets a total score of around 1.6 stars (vice 2.36, as of Feb 15, 20015).  Most seasoned Amazon shoppers would not buy an very expensive product with lots of detailed reviews averaging less than two stars- thus the tampering.	-1
maybe if these had gold embedded in them they'd be worth this much.  but as it stands - this isn't any more special than any other PLA you can get for about half the price.	-1
Third 1.0 second new and this latest one isn't leveled and after two hours trying to manually level in about done with da vinci. Why when I have orders does this happen when from the factory these are suppose to be leveled.	-1
[EDIT] So originally, I was asked by XYZ to write on Amazon a favorable review. At that time, I had no issue seeing as all was great thus far. I was an early adopter of their product. XYZ, in return would provide me with free curriculum. I wrote the review below and they verified. The curriculum was a joke. The product promised was a bunch of empty zip files. I emailed and sent messages other ways with no response for days. Then I called their number and explained what had happened and I was told, "Sorry, but keep trying". Now I even tried today without any luck. Seems like their customer service has gone to great (at the beginning to despicable cheats today.) In fact, if I had known how much of non-support I would get, I would have waited or gone somewhere else. Like I said below, it is a great starter printer BUT the service is so bad, that I have to give it a 1 star. Many people rely on customer service for a variety of things and if their customer service is poor, the product cannot live up to its full potential.  [ORIGINAL POST] This is a great starter printer. Easy to use right out of box. Manual calibration can be a little tricky until you get it. If you are looking for quality 3D printing and large sizes for a fraction of the cost of the competition, this is a great little machine. My son and I contralto use it. The customer service is great and very responsive.	-1
I have been a long time owner of this printer having mine for over 3 years during its initial release. Let me say fantasic hardware for the price back in the day, but worthless today. The software is the worst part this company spends more time making code to restrict you then they do actually improving their software. The price may be nice, but they scam you by forcing you to buy their filament. Don't bother with them, there are many other great printers these days for better prices.	-1
HORRIBLE SOFTWARE bricked the printer instantly as i tried to upgrade the firmware, and will not connect to my computer!	-1
Never buy anything from xyzprinting they will not honor their Warranty if the product is defective and they have zero support if something goes wrong with the product. Worst company ever. Never ever buy anything from them ever.	-1
I will first say that this is a good price for a typical "consumer" machine and it is fairly easy to operate when it works but it doesn't always work and i would not recommend it unless you are comfortable with the idea of diagnosing and repairing the machine on your own fairly regularly. this could include significant disassembly and even soldering.    I have been working with 3d printers for almost 20 years, i have purchased and operated a lot of different machines from a lot of different companies and i can tell you that they are all complicated and all break down. They all have problems so i am not judging this machine or xyz on that fact alone and this is by far the cheapest machine i have ever used so i am giving it a lot of credit for that.    The real problem here is that XYZ support is horrendous, it would be fine that it takes at least a full day to get a response if all the responses weren't canned replies. there is almost no regard to the actual content of the support ticket that is filed. I'm not sure if this is due to what seems to be a significant language barrier or just standard protocol. Specific questions are not addressed and you are simply directed to a standard user manual where you will either figure out the issue on your own or you won't.  Among dozens of other problems that I've had i ran in to an issue that is apparently very common in these machines. The wire connectors at the extruder head fail. I went through a few support tickets on the issue and tried various work arounds, i was able to make it work most of the time until eventually the problem became too persistent to deal with it. I filed another support ticket expecting to get replacement parts but now i was 2 days out of the 1 year warranty and i was told there was no longer any support for my machine but i could purchase new parts if i wanted.  Material is also an issue, i don't mind that the cartridges are proprietary and locked but there is no way to hot swap so if like me, you print a lot of large parts you can end up with dozens of material cartridges with 25-50 grams of material that are useless because it is not enough material to start a new job and there is now way to swap them during the print cycle.  The proprietary software is hit or miss, it gets a lot of updates but is continually buggy and recently it has been updated to include a confusing, nuisance advertisement every time it opens.  Here's another interesting detail, I have purchased all of my cartridges from amazon but the original machine purchase was initially made at a local Micro Center. I purchased the machine in January 2015 with a 3 year extended warranty since i know all 3d printers can be fickle. in February the glass print bed shattered so i took it back to Micro Center to get a replacement. They honored the replacement but also told me that they had not anticipated so many problems with the machines and they were now going to revoke the extended warranty and it would not be valid for the remainder of the 3 years! I'm not even sure that's legal but it certainly highlights the issue of product reliability.  I feel bad writing such a harsh review of a machine this inexpensive when i know that much more expensive machines have the same issues but as i said, the support for the issues is what could have won me over.  When the machine does work it is capable of printing models of a pretty good quality for a typical FDM machine. Models from this machine are nearly indistinguishable from models produced 12 year old machine that cost $30k... the difference is that the $30k machine was a workhorse that ran for nearly 10 years without ever having a hiccup and the few times that it did there was a service tech on site the next day repairing it.	-1
The print quality is great on this printer just the down side is that you have to pay for their overpriced filament cartridge.  It comes with 600g for $25 while for 1000g or 1 kg is $20.  Also the little connector on the extruder is horrible it stops working after about 120 hrs of printing, so don't plan on printing much on here.  Also, if you do have any problems with your printer, the customer service is HORRIBLE so don't plan on getting your printer fixed pretty quickly.	-1
I will say this when it works it's a good cheap printer, but it hardly works.  Right now I'm trying to get help from customer service for it not extruding filament and for the bed constantly being out of calibration.  Customer service is the worst thing about this printer, all I'm getting is run around and questions about unrelated stuff.  And let me be clear I've had this thing less than a month and haven't even hit 50 hours of printing yet.  The other thing that wasn't great was right out of the box the door hinge was broke.  If you buy this just be aware of what might happen to you, it's good when it prints but those times are few and far between.  Addition Ended up returning this printer, Amazon was kind enough to take it back.  Seriously don't buy this printer it's not worth the head aches it will give you.	-1
Several of the droppers were chipped on the tips.	-1
Wont stick to anything.  Worthless	-1
I've tried several times to get this to work, it always ends up a gluey mess no matter what I do.  Would not recommend this.	-1
What a bunch of sh*t.  I spent $40 so I could use this for dissolve able support material, but it is like it's OILED!  It will not stick AT ALL to ABS, PLA, HIPS, or PETG.  WTF.  The extruder just balls up because the material will not transfer to the supports.  This is a total waste of $40 and WEEKS of my life trying every temperature imaginable on each of the materials I had.	-1
purchased these things because i needed phoenix plugs on one end of my cables and rca plugs on the other for my amps and receiver.... unfortunately they didn't work well so i replaced them with good quality rca cables which i cut off on one end and wired to the phoenix plugs, a solid connection on one side of the cable worked out better than two sides of the cable wired to plugs....	-1
Had to return. Could not get it to work on smartphones.	-1
Picture is bad, huge time lag, front glass piece came out after 3 uses on the electrical job. Don't buy this crap.	-1
Hard to believe, with over a billion iOS devices in use, that this is an Android only scope. Perhaps if the developers took this into consideration, they'd understand just how much money they're losing. Interesting that they use an Apple MacBookPro in their images on Amazon's site - however, there is no indication that there is an App that would make the scope compatible. This looks like deceptive advertising, so I'll contact Amazon in regards to this.	-1
The seller apparently noticed my three star review, and contacted me to say they were refunding my money. Which they did, although I did not respond or not ask them for my money back or a return or anything. Afterwards, the seller asked if I would please take down my review. This is basically trying to buy your way out of bad reviews, which I think completely dishonest, underhanded, and unethical. It undermines the validity of the entire review system and makes it a joke. So I am changing my review to one star. Not cool people. Not cool. To the seller: fix the problems and you will get good reviews and happy customers. The problem is with your software, which is something you have control over, not my review, which is something you don't and shouldn't have control over.  Original review below:  Galaxy Note 5, Android 7.0 and Windows 10 (June 2017). It is unfortunate the included booklet points to an Android app that is broken. Time waster. Did not work at all at first with Depstech app. Total fail. Was about to return it. Also tried it on Windows, VLC with Surface 3, works but horrible 3 sec. delay. I guess they have a Windows app but I'd rather have it work on Android on my phone. IDs as a Teslong USB camera on Windows. Looked in Play store for other camera apps. OTG Camera works, after a couple of tries, not very dependable to bring up camera live view. Noticed a Teslong camera app, which seems nearly identical to Depstech app, same developer, but actually works. Camera doesn't always come up at first, but back out of live view and try again, usually comes up on 2nd try. If those apps don't work try some different ones I guess before returning it.  Dual USB A/micro is clever. One problem is the camera head is not marked as to which side is "UP". Makes navigating bewildering. I taped a small white mark on the camera head top position once I had it oriented correctly. The entire length of the cable is stiffened. Not exactly sure why the cable is so long, though I guess it could be convenient if you find some way to snake the cable into a long pipe or space. Any pipe with a couple of bends and you're not going to be able to push it through, probably, without pulling through with a string or something from the other side.  Image is so-so. Not what I would call hi def, focus zone is from about 3 inches to maybe 8 inches. LEDs are bright, get a bit warm. There is a bit of a lip on the back of the camera cylinder that can get caught on stuff trying to back the camera out of a hole. I might want to Sugru or tape around that to streamline it a bit so it won't get stuck.	-1
had trouble sticking to the bed,kept bubbling up in spots.cleaned the bed with alcohol it still bubbled up.was running the bed at 50c so it wasn't that high,taking off the bed it came up hard so maybe it was a flaw in only a few spots	-1
I am a little disappointed with these Taps as the openings where you place the fuses are defective in 3 of the 5 that were sent to me.  It makes it  extremely difficult to push in the fuse.  I managed to move it a little and did get the fuse in but other people may not be so lucky.  I tried to take a few photos but may be hard to see this.  The quality of the area that holds the fuses is not good :-(	-1
In the end I got these to work, but they're pretty poor. I had to use a pair of pliers to force fuses into them, even the ones they included. It was completely impossible to get them into the fuse holder on my new Ford vehicle. I had to file the ends down and also narrow the ends quite a bit with a rough file before they would fit.	-1
I don't know if I got a bum set or they changed this part, but I am unable to get any fuse to fit into these fuse taps. Yes, they will go in if I bang on them or use pliers to get them in, but if I need to put them out that means I'll have to use pliers to get them out.  Also if you are not pushing straight in, they are so hard to get in the legs of the fuse will bend over 90 degrees if you are not careful.	-1
My son's favorite color... he loves printing with this filament.  Updated... my son has the XYZ Davinci Jr.  DO NOT BUY THIS FILAMENT for Jr. Model printers!  This is ABS filament and the Jr. models require PLA filament.  This was not in the FAQ or notes when I purchased this product for my son a few months ago.  He was able to print a few test items, but that's it.  He recently had a school project and he designed a few taller objects that either kept falling over or unraveling after a few layers.  I had no idea that there were even different filaments for XYZ printers.  This fit perfectly and the spool looks exactly the same.  But ABS filament requires a heated bed to print and virtually NO home printer has that, much less an entry level one.  So now I'm stuck with an almost full spool of ABS filament that will likely never be used.  Sure wish there was more information about this available while ordering.  I found out by getting on the Davinci support website where I out of pure luck found out that Jr. models don't take BLA filament.  It's obscure and hard to find.  Not this sellers fault and he even now has it as a FAQ, but unless you are familiar with 3D printing, I doubt you realize there is a difference between the filament material either.  Again, it's the same size, comes on an identical spool, fits, etc.  But it won't work.	-1
This refill has several times given me feedback that is not authorized, i unplug the printer and replug and then it works. The chip is in perfectly so I am not sure why it sometimes works. It is also usually cheaper to just by a new cart- even though that feels wasteful.	-1
The pricing on this item makes no sense at all. This "economical" refill is priced at several dollars MORE than an original cartridge.	-1
This is by far, the most worthless set of parts I have ever purchased. If you tighten them enough to stop leaks they will break off inside your hotend. If I could give a 0 star review I would. Waste of time and money!	-1
3 of the 5 jammed immediately, one snapped in half while tightening, and the last one worked for a couple weeks before jamming.	-1
got these for my all metal mk8 extruder. The inlet on the throat was too sharp an angle and it constantly shaved plastic off. Also, the nylon tube isn't long enough, which caused a backup of melted plastic in the throat and it ultimately caused a jam. I don't know if these will work well on other hotends, but if you have a mk8, look for a different throat.	-1
These are impressively powerful magnets. They can pin relatively thick objects to a steel surface. The shape is practical for grasping.  However I have some concerns. A minor concern is that the metal magnets are exposed on the working face, and in most cases installed with a slight tilt such that one side of the metal magnet protrudes slightly higher than the plastic shell around it. This seems to offer more potential for scratching whiteboards or refrigerator paint than a magnet fully encased in plastic would.  A more serious concern is that the plastic gripping shell, which measures about 1.3 inch in diameter, seems to be made of a brittle type plastic. I note another reviewer says one of theirs arrived with the plastic already shattered, confirming my instincts. If the plastic breaks the much smaller magnet would be released and these newfangled super-powered magnets can be deadly to children or anyone who swallows a couple of them. If swallowed separately, the magnets will perforate intestinal walls as they seek to come together inside your child's guts. The initial attractive force begins at a distance of about 2 inches, and WILL puncture vital tissues as forces increase exponentially in the last fraction of an inch. You will have no idea what is going on, or why, and your child will be dying. So while these may be very practical magnets for adult use, you should keep them far away from children.	-1
The filament arrived wet and noticeably bubbles and pops when extruded. Im trying to dry it out with desiccants but it may be lost. Also this stuff ships from china which was not listed in the description so expect to have to be home to sign for it or otherwise chase the delivery guy down.	-1
I got this filament to make some globes for my WS2811 RGB LED string. The filament constantly jammed in the feeder mechanism and the final straw was when it clogged the hot end requiring a complete dismantle to remove the stuck piece. I tried printing between 240-250C and setting different extruder speeds, but it didn't make a difference. I ended up throwing out the roll since it was past Amazon's return period.	-1
Not pleased	-1
Pure junk!  You get a few swipes and your done!  LOL at me for this purchase.	-1
Very disappointed. Based on price and reviews ordered.  Compared to Dura Gold  3M etc this product does sand hard epoxy, fillers and long time cured paint but still clogs very quickly resulting in loss of productivity. Sanding anything soft is a non starter due to almost instant clogging. Adhesive is very sticky and leaves glue on sanding blocks and backing film is difficult to pull of without using a knife to lift an edge to peel it back.  Costs less than premium paper but performance is much less and to me not worth the "savings".  Ok if you don't have much to do and have time to fool with it but for the price, nope.  Will not buy again. Possibly I just got a "bad" roll since lots of folks rate it highly, never the less, one and done for me.	-1
FLIR - You got two strikes so far... Unit #1 - Horrible Back-light Bleeding.... Unit #2 - Dead Pixels!... Unit #3 is on it's way... Any bets on the next issue?!?!?  UNIT #1: Right out of the box, upon power on, I see a big yellow pressure point on the display assembly. For the price you're paying, this is unacceptable!  At minimum, the display shouldn't have a big yellow pressure point in the top right corner. Basic movement of the product causes the display to discolor, which indicates either A) display quality issue B) design issue  or C) Assembly issue ( i.e. FLIR's factory that got torque happy when assembling).  Upon adjusting the the brightness, it's only worse. What makes matters worse - you rely on contrast/color with this tool, yet somehow this made it out of factory.  UPDATE: Unit #2 - Dead Pixels (a little bearable back-light bleeding. Dead/Defective Pixels Unacceptable!  - Defective Pixels galore....See pictures attached.	-1
I find this patty paper to be thinner and less waxed that the commercial papers I have used.  The meat sticks to the paper and the patties are hard to separate.  There are better choices out there. Wouldn't buy again.	-1
Funny this is the same brand I ordered with my press but this time they got the size right other was 4.75x5. I don't understand some of the complaints about sticking, I always have to defrost my burgers to get apart. Haven't used them yet but guessing they will be no better or worse than paper used in prepared burgers bought in the meat case. Have used them today and all went well, upper/lower sheet keep the press clean and simple to stick in a foodsaver bag for freezing. One thing these came in a box labeled Pattywax Patty Paper made by Bagcraft Papercon. Different than shown bug right and made in USA, wow we make patty paper.  Reordered and again wrong size, not 5.5 square or brand showen, tired of this	-1
I don't get why there are not more poor reviews. These papers are HORRIBLE for freezing. I'm glad I only made 8 burgers to start. I can't even separate them with a knife. There is no noticeable wax in these papers, I might as well have used wet newspaper between the burgers before freezing. Patties will need to be thawed before I can separate them. Don't buy these if you plan on freezing stacked burgers for use one at a time.	-1
Good value for the hobbyist.  Happy with my purchase.  Downgrading this review from 5 stars to two.  One of the probes has developed an intermittent open near the BNC connector. This is with only two months of light use.  The price is so low that I am tempted to buy a second set though.	-1
Nice leather aroma. I've been using two squirts daily in my car. I've found the fragrance dissipates after one day. Don't know if I'd buy again as it's a bit of a hassle to me to spray daily. I've changed the rating to 2 stars. The price has gone up almost double from the $8.99 I paid. Just not worth $16.99 for something that needs to be sprayed daily IMO.	-1
caustic!	-1
I like Chemical Guys detail spray, so I thought I would try this. I suggest you do not waste your money on this product.	-1
I suppose for the low price, for TEN - I shouldn't complain. Nine out of ten do appear to be functional, I checked them with an Ohmmeter. The overall look of the button and surrounding body in my opinion are barely acceptable, some buttons push in further than some others. Just remember, these things are small, just drill a 3/8 inch hole. I would not buy again.	-1
Product delivered does not match the photo listed. Thermistor is not mounted by threaded screw, and is actually a cheaper hotend seen in other listings.	-1
not as tight inside the nozzles as my oem flashforge ptfe tubes  ID is the same seems like OD is a little smaller	-1
I've had it for 2 months, and it's dead. It's a better solution than the factory, where it was simply held against the hotend with a rubber boot, but today, the wire leads came off. The sensor end looked scorched. I print ABS mostly and I never exceed 250 degrees so I'm very disappointed that it failed.	-1
Sparkles, I can't say I expected this stuff to be a little bit translucent and shimmer, but as always SainSmart delivers of filament that is amazing to work with  Ya this is an update got my third roll and noticed the diameter is all over the place with this batch, it is very disappointing I love this stuff (not so much the color as what you can do with it.)	-1
I am not happy with the performance of this filament. I have three machines with bowden extruders. I have printed with flexible materials without problem for long time. I have extruders designed to use flexible.  I have successfully printed with Inland flex,  Hatchbox TPU and ninjaflex. So i like to say that i know what i am able to tweak and change to make things work.  Problem is this filament IS VERY FLEXIBLE. Too flexible if you ask me. Is so soft, that it bends and kinks too easy. The roll isn't even wound tightly. The filament has this wavy pattern to it, and as it goes thru the  bowden PTFE tubing, those kinks act as brakes and creates too much resistance.  Halfway thru the PTFE im unable to even feed it by hand  with all the resistance the filament creates.  Simply put, there should be a very clear disclaimer that this filament its technically intended to be used on direct drive setups. I have tested a new ptfe tube,  and various machines, and the resistance is so great because the filament kinks inside it.  Havent been able to successfully print, and now i am sitting on a roll that cant use.	-1
This product does not function properly in my Fusion3 F400-s.  We tried multiple settings within our Simplify3D software to no avail.  No matter what we tried, even after tech support, the material simply would not feed properly. It seems to be too soft for the product to be fed into the tube that feeds the print head. The wheel simply will not grip it, no matter how tightly or loosely set.  We had high hopes for this, because we wanted to make flexible coils with it.  Sad Pandas now, money wasted.	-1
I don't normally leave reviews and when I have they have never been a low review. This is great product but it's knotted throughout the roll which requires refilling the entire spool. I've had knots before but nothing like this mess.	-1
Well it didn't work in either of out printers one has direct drive and the other has a tube and really this is nasty looking filament wavy.	-1
the print quality is horrific and you have to tweek so many settings to get it right	-1
i have a Davinci 1.0, not a shot in H@#$ to print this material.	-1
Title of item is "SainSmart Flexible TPU 3D Printers Filament, 1.75mm,1kg/2.2lbs (Yellow)".  I clearly see "1kg" in that title.  Does anyone think to themselves "awesome, I am getting a .2 kg spool!".  Very misleading.  It is industry standard to label items with the weight of the product you are buying, not the weight of the entire package including packaging, etc.  I am making this a one star review to call this out in hopes that people look at it and determine can you trust someone you clearly cant trust.  Also, one other issue with this filament is that the diameter is very inconsistent.  I have typically found at least 50-100 feet of unusable filament on every roll I have purchased (diameter of less than 1.5mm).  The normal diameter is about 1.65mm and I have never measured it to be over 1.7mm.  So here again the title is incorrect.  Otherwise, the quality of prints when you have consistent diameter is great. So in summary: Title of listing - 1kg, what you get is .8kg Typical diameter of filament is 1.65 to 1.7mm Inconsistent diameter - Often run into spots where it will drop below 1.5mm and as low as 1.1mm. Usually have to trash 50-100 feet per roll as it simply stops feeding.  Of course you only have 30 days to discover this and unless you are a commercial printer you may not discover soon enough to get a replacement. Quality of prints - Great provided you don't hit a thin spot in the filament. If you cant live with the limitations you may want to consider other brands.	-1

Also, one other issue with this filament is that the diameter is very inconsistent.  I have typically found at least 50-100 feet of unusable filament on every roll I have purchased (diameter of less than 1.5mm).  The normal diameter is about 1.65mm and I have never measured it to be over 1.7mm.  So here again the title is incorrect.  Otherwise, the quality of prints when you have consistent diameter is great. So in summary: Title of listing - 1kg, what you get is .8kg Typical diameter of filament is 1.65 to 1.7mm Inconsistent diameter - Often run into spots where it will drop below 1.5mm and as low as 1.1mm. Usually have to trash 50-100 feet per roll as it simply stops feeding.  Of course you only have 30 days to discover this and unless you are a commercial printer you may not discover soon enough to get a replacement. Quality of prints - Great provided you don't hit a thin spot in the filament. If you cant live with the limitations you may want to consider other brands.	-1
Title of item is "SainSmart Flexible TPU 3D Printers Filament, 1.75mm,1kg/2.2lbs (Black)".  I clearly see "1kg" in that title.

Disappointed to receive .80kg when the listing is clearly for 1 kg. Avoid purchasing unless you're expecting .80kg. Note that the sellers title is obfuscate in the sense that they bury in the listing that it's 1kg total weight which includes the spool. However after weighing the filament with the spool, it weighs 1.9lbs. It's obvious that putting 1kg in the title and having the photo of the filament show a sticker that says 1kg that SainSmart is trying to pull one over on us.	-1
bad bad bad, first it not even adhesion to the build bed, it sticks more than good and leave bad marks at some parts and other parts it just keep peeling when the bed is heated, the second bad thing its more slippery that the usual blue tape, I mean what is wrong here I got this so that I have my print stick and not move yet its smoother and my printed objects shifted more than the normal Kapton or blue tape would. I am disappointed about this and I won't buy again	-1
no two measurements are the same	-1
Very poor quality. Mirror edges chipped. Not well finished at all. Look elsewhere.	-1
Barely as large as advertised. And so thin that putting a coin inside of a bag sometimes breaks it. Not to mention there was a malfunction in the process to where about half of the bags had holes in the bottem just a tiny spot that was never sealed.	-1
Does not work. Filled test tube up with store bought wine and it reads 0. I will return and buy something different.	-1
Although the hydrometer probably works, it is too long.  Maybe I should have paid attention to the length before I purchased. All my other hydrometers are much shorter in fit into 10 inch tall tube.  This one would require a 12 inch tube.	-1
Arrived broken as was my heart when I found it shattered.	-1
They must have changed something. This stuff is garbage, don't waste so much money on something that will just waste your time. The heated bed will cause the adhesive to bubble and you'll never be able to get a level bed.  Not to mention if you somehow manage to get a print to actually stick and not be pressed into the sheet, then good luck getting it off. Just use slurry or literally nothing at all, you'll have better luck that way	-1
NO. blade does not stay down.  put a bungie on it and folds up quickly! Heavy.	-1
These are actually 2 1/2 fl oz. capacity vs the .7 fl. oz as advertised so they are a little bigger than I really wanted for packing with my gun cleaning and oiling supplies. Quality of bottle (very pliable) is good.  Needle is nice and long and of good quality. Perfect for gun oiling. Will be easy to a apply small amount of oil exactly where needed. I just wish the bottles were a little smaller as advertised as .7 oz capacity would have been perfect ( 4 stars off for that). Big difference from advertised .7 fl. oz to  actual 2 1/2 oz. Very frustrating	-1
Crap quality. Nail/brad will bend immediately. I will find another brand next time.	-1
waste of money! this is nothing more than a baby box of nails that you could find at the dollar store.	-1
What you see:  Nice compartmented box with sorted nails and brads.  What you get:  Plastic baggie with pile of nails, several with heads broken off.  No clue how many or how few.  And empty plastic box.  Enjoy.	-1
Went through 2-rolls - will never purchase again.  Lets start with stability; I kid you not - (2) printed parts 10mm thick busted right in half while attached to a metal rod being hit by a hammer.  The vibration alone busted the parts right in half.  As for finish; Well, it comes out extremely stringy on the Z-layers.  Didn't seem to bond well.  However, looking at the parts that just fell apart - the center is solid plastic.  Some on here say higher heat, some say lower - any with decent reviews took the time to post extravagant prints.  Do I doubt there legitimacy?  You bet I do.  Usage; Snapping is a serious issue.  Out of all the super cheap different brands I've tried this was the most brittle; snapping within the first hour or two of being idle.  Snaps at the extruder, snaps inside the extruder, snaps at the reel ... snaps everywhere.  You can literally bend it about 15-degrees by hand and snap it.  If I wasn't printing a full roll all at once; I had to disable the extruder just to get all the snapped pieces out to start again.	-1
I wouldn't recommend at all. The spool that I received was wound so bad that every time I try to use it the filament won't unspool. As far as it being transparent, yeah not so much.	-1
I've printed on many manufacture's PLA filament, and so far this has been the most problematic. The temp range on spool says 190-230C but, for me nothing below 220C worked. On my first 3hr print, for the first 1.5hrs the filament just kept winding off the side of the spool (see pic). I would recoil mid print and make sure there was no twisting in the line and put back. Then every few minutes, be-oing, filament ejected off the roll. Very annoying to have to baby sit a print. Finally, I just used a shop clamp on my vertical frame, to act as a endstop rail for the filament, so it wouldn't jump off.  I will probably give it one more test print before returning it. Even though this filament is a few bucks cheaper, I don't know if its worth the headache.	-1
JUNK DO NOT BUY !!!!	-1
To small to even open	-1
Cheap Plastic which cracked and split on first use.	-1
The metal contacts are great. however, the plastic housing is low quality. Two came in the package: one had pieces of the housing broken off right out of the box even though it was packaged well. The other fell apart as I was looking it over to see if it had any defects. Get a better quality unit or you could risk an electrical fire.	-1
I normally like stuff from uxcell, but this is a heap of garbage.  The pins on the units all had to be straightened out after delivery, the ICs are a pain to put in and extract from the adapter and overall it just reeks of poor quality. It does however do its job, just take my advice and spend a little more on something that is a lot better quality.	-1
Cheap flexible junk, that has such short pins and is so rubbery that it POPS OUT OF A BREAD BOARD just when you think it is fully seated. In the junk drawer these go until I'm desperate enough to use eight female to male jumpers on it.	-1
Great printer, especially for the price. I have some notes:  It is advertised as ready to go out of the box, but as other users have mentioned, the z-axis may need to be adjusted. My end offset was 2.1 mm. Additionally, the build platform was not level, with respect to the carriage for the nozzle. I was able to remedy this by loosening the screws (hex drive) that hold the glass to the platform, and adjusting a separate screw underneath the glass to level out the right side.  After making those adjustments, the Da Vinci Jr. prints like a dream for me. I am not sure how I feel about the proprietary filament, but that is the price you pay for an inexpensive printer (see ink jet business model). I don't think that aspect will impact low volume users.  UPDATE 1 5/30/2015 : After almost 2 weeks of trying to get the printer to work consistently, I have given up. I never experienced the error codes seen by other users, but I did have significant problems with the hardware. Specifically, the carriage for the print head being unsupported on the right side. The sage can be accounted for by leveling the build plate, which I did initially. I quickly changed this back, as it was difficult to get the same alignment of the plate and carriage, and it was not addressing the problem in the appropriate area.  All in all, I never once got a complete print. Even simple objects would not start correctly (filament not sticking to glass, paper, painter's tape, glue stick), or if it did, the printer would print portions improperly, resulting in layers being out of place. Additionally, like other users, I heard a knocking sound from the top of the print head, as if too much filament was being fed and was kicked back. Support suggested adjusting the Z offset, but by the time it was high enough to alleviate this issue, the filament was coming out of the nozzle to high above the build plate to stick properly.  You get what you pay for. I put a little too much hope in this printer for the price, and it is ALMOST there. Unfortunately, I am returning it, and saving up for a more reliable model.	-1
1. Uneven print results, some fairly good, many very poor. Adjusting 'z' axis didn't help. 2. Filament length reader showed 1 meter remaining but found about 20 meters left on reel and no way to fix it so the 20 meters was left unusable. 3. Proprietary filament spools. Can't use other brands with new colors. A special NFC card is required for EACH new roll of filament, the card is rendered useless.  This may be cheap in price but the fact that it requires special filament spool and the filament remaining counter can't be corrected makes this a poor choice in my view. Evidently the IRFD card is preset for 100 meter filament and it just counts down based on time the extruder operates so Is essentially open loop (i.e. the system does not actually measure the filament dispensed).  UPdate: Da Vinci Jr. 1.0 3D Printer  Things a buyer should know:  1. This printer uses proprietary filament reels.....you cannot use 3rd party reels. 2. The filament cartridge holds 0.6Kg while 3rd party reels hold 1.0Kg, thus costing about 50% more per reel. 3. The reels hold an NFC card (Near field Communication) which is used to contain a measure of the amount of filament that is left on the reel. That sounds good but it is an open loop counter, it reduces the count as the print head moves, so if the filament breaks and the head continues to move, the count is reduced as if you were using filament. When the count gets to zero, you can no longer print and there is no reset, you have to buy another reel with a new NFC card, even if you have a large amount of filament left on your existing reel.  You need to ask yourself:  1. Why is there an NFC card to keep count of the amount of filament? Why not let the printer run until it runs out of filament? If they need to keep count of the remaining filament, why not measure it directly with a sensor, then shut down if the filament breaks?. 2. Why can't you use 3rd party filament?  I am not at all happy with this printer. Will return for refund.	-1
I am on my third printer. Bought the first one in April, within 35 days it was dead. Contacted XYZprinting and they refused to honor the warranty. Amazon stepped up as usual and saved the day. Received second printer and within 5 days, it too was dead. Again, no help from DYZprinting, again Amazon saved the day. Let me just tell you how much Amazon rocks! Their customer service reps are excellent (except one dude named James who didn't seem to know what he was doing. Perhaps retraining or a career change is in the works). If you are going to buy one even after this review, make sure you buy it from Amazon. Not only do they have the best price on it, but they rock at customer service.	-1
Had i know about the chipset issue in the filament roll, I would have never bought this. Other than that... Hey, it's a cheap printer.  Edit: Unfortunately this is a printer mostly for rich kids who don't care about money. Printer is cheap but Can only use filament from the maker. And THAT is HORRIDLY expensive.  Also, NFC tags are a pain in the ass to use. I have 6+ Filament rolls ALMOST FULL of filament. But all chips show empty, therefore I cannot print.  Wish I had not bought it.	-1
I have printed a few bench tests with this and have benchmarked it against my other 3d printers (Dremel 3ED40, JG Aurora 603S, Mendel 90, Geetech 301, Anycubic Linear Plus, Tevo little Monster, Flashforge Dreamer stock, and Flashforge dreamer with Flexion Extruder Upgrade) . I mainly bought this for the mixing capability. During unboxing and inspecting it I really had some mixed opinions on it.  (Update) (After using up the 2 spools that came with it I purchased 6 more spools on Amazon. I used about 15 meters of spool from one of the new spools and not the printer displays unable to read spool (now I have a $25 overpriced spool of PLA that I cannot use on the printer it was designed for). I have had multiple filament jams, usually 5-6 hours into a 8-16 hour print. When the filament jams it does not pause the print like other 3d printers I own, it only gives you the option to cancel the print (waste of money, filament, and time). I tested the filament that the printer will not read on another printer to see if the jams are coming from the XYZ filament, It printed flawlessly on other printers. I haven't even used 3 spools of filament on it yet and the nozzle has clogged twice. My advice is to buy a slightly better quality printer. Build Quality: the machine is Similar to a RepRap style inside so the build blate is not on the Z axis (this makes the machine large considering its build volume). The Z Axis uses four 10mm linear rods so it is built very robust but has a single stepper and threaded rod. The extruder carriage is using a single 8mm linear rod with the other support just being plastic on a piece of sheetmetal (I can see this wearing out fairly fast). The internal frame is a great design using 2020 extruded aluminum (much sturdier than most other consumer level 3d printers). The Hotend is fairly good and heats up fast. The extruder setup works great.  Software: The software is slow and really slows down my computer. It does a great job of adding support materials. I works great seting up the mixing and previewing it. If you decide to print with a raft it makes the raft way larger than it needs to be. I did try and do a print with a brim and support material, but it only added support material and not a brim (small bug for some, big bug for others). Overall it is easy to use, slow, and doesnt give you alot of control over your prints.  Pros: it is really easy to setup and use, you get a fairly descent machine for the money. The software for this does a great job of slicing and adding supports for complex prints. The prints do come out fairly good. The resolution of the prints leaves a little to be desired, Bridges and Overhangs come out almost flawless. Calibration system is spot on and easy to use.  Cons: You can only use the XYZ filaments. They have a tag in them to let the machine know you are using the companys proprietory filaments. The machine does not always read the Tag in the filament. I had one roll that came with the maching that the machine will not read. The available filaments for the machine are small, overpriced, and have limited colors available. Due to the somewhat disapointing build of the X and Y Carriages the machine does not print that fast compared to other machines I own.  Final thoughts. I believe this is a great machine for artists, beginers, kids, or people who just want to make small things. This is not a very good machine for engineers, People looking to produce usable parts or other everyday items(due to the limits of PLA filament).  Cons:	-1
You will save money in the long run with more a expensive printer!  With that said, let me also state that the the printer itself is not bad.  It was easy to install the software and print.  It was cheap.  But for the money you save on the printer, you will easily pay more than a far more expensive printer in the long run on proprietary PLA spools.  Yes -- I bought this printer because of the price. The disappointment that I have is that I have a lot of PLA that I cannot use in the printer because of the NFC chip in the spools.  I have also found that the NFC chip disables the printer before the proprietary spools run out of PLA (10-30 meters per roll).  So now I am ending up with even more left over PLA.  Just a few weeks of use and I am already looking for a different printer. My recommendation is do NOT buy this printer if you think it is a good price.  It is not.  Look for something that will let you use non proprietary PLA.  UPDATE: I went to print today and the printer and software told me that the spool was empty and refused to print (what a joke!!!).  There is more than half of the PLA remaining on the spool.  This was so infuriating that I unplugged the printer, walked it out, and threw it in the recycle bin.  I then gathered up all remaining XYZ spools that I had and tossed it as well.  The printer worked OK, but their proprietary spools will eventually be the downfall of this company.  I will never buy another product from XYZ.  I just finished ordering a new printer from a different manufacturer.	-1
I LOVE THIS UNIT !, this is my first printer so I wanted something easy to start and this thing works great! cheap and clean. I have over 300 hrs on it now, with only 2 errors that reset with the on/off switch. The Good very easy to use and clean.  The Bad the XYZ filament isn't that good so far, You need to use aftermarket filament for best results (search web) The printer is a bit slow.  I would tell anyone who is starting 3d printing to get this printer! And I would buy another.	-1
Never buy anything from xyzprinting they will not honor their Warranty if the product is defective and they have zero support if something goes wrong with the product. Worst company ever. Never ever buy anything from them ever. Wish I could give them zero stars.	-1

Edit: Revised original review:  3D printing is not a consumer-ready technology yet. Buyers beware that many of the low ratings you see on many printers come from people frustrated with an imperfect technology rather than a faulty machine. That being said, I had originally rated this machine at 5 stars because it made excellent prints with less than expected effort. About a month or so later the printer stopped feeding filament.  I will keep making updates here for anyone wanting to know my experience.  Edit: December 2015  The printer has stopped feeding filament. I have contacted support and have been instructed to watch multiple videos on how to disassemble the feeding mechanism and perform a deep-cleaning. This has not solved the problem and am still waiting for a reply.  Edit: 1/13/2016  I am now almost 2 weeks without being able to print on this printer due to the slow turn around on support tickets. Each response/reply cycle takes around 2 - 3 days which adds up quickly when cycling through troubleshooting steps. The customer service aside from the speed is otherwise friendly. They are very courteous and helpful.  Edit: 1/19/2016  Still not working. The printer requires repairs and will be sent back to the company.  Edit: 2/5/2016  Still not working. Received printer back after sending it in for repairs and it still has the same exact problem it left with. Moving down to 1 star.  Edit: 2/24/2016  Still not working. Tech support has requested that I send the printer back in for further repairs. It's a shame because this printer made good prints back when it worked. This time the ticket response time took up to 6 days between responses. Wow! Low confidence in the company and that I will ever see this machine work again.  Edit: 3/18/2016  Don't know where my printer is. The machine has been away for repair since 2/22/2016. I have left multiple requests on my ticket for a status update with no reply for 14 days now. I called the company and they say it's "still in the testing" and that they will "check to the status and leave the update on the ticket".  I've found an online support group for DaVinci owners if you ever need a sympathetic community. They offer advice and counseling: [...]  Edit: 3/23/2016  No contact, no reply, no update. They have stopped responding to the ticket. I have to make phone calls to get new activity.  Conclusion:  I did eventually get the printer back around October. The feeding problem was never solved and had gotten worse now with all of the assembling/disassembling I've had to do through the process.  Because of the method of feeding XYZ uses in all of their printers a good deal of stress is put on the feeding tube. This causes the "catches" that hold the tube in place to eventually wear out and no longer hold the tubing. I fixed this myself with parts from a hardware store. Before you think that there is something wrong with the extruder to cause all of this stress, I can assure you that the extruder feeds with no more than expected resistance when heated. This is confirmed by myself AND by XYZ. I've even had the print head replaced just to make sure.  The actual original problem is rooted in the feeding mechanism itself. Over time it loses traction and stops feeding. I also had to resort to fixing this myself with external parts, but because of the nature of the problem I have to continue to maintain this area of the printer myself.  I eventually just gave up on the machine and gave it away to my cousin who wanted to try and see if he could get a free printer out of it but I haven't heard any word yet of any success.  Cheers!	-1

I ordered this 3D printer in and it arrived a couple of days later. This has been the 2nd 3D printer that I have ordered through Amazon in the last couple of months. My goal is to produce some toys for my grandchildren for Christmas. The 1st 3D printer came as a RepRap kit which I assembled. However, I am still trying to get it to work. Hence, I ordered the XYZ Printer Junior.  I will simply describe the chain of events, since I am sure that many people go through exactly the same process.  I un-boxed the XYZ Junior and had it printing a couple of hours later. A few minutes after that, I had my 1st successful 3D print. The 2nd 3D print was printed overnight and took 13 hours to print. I'll get back to those prints in a minute.  The instructions say to connect to your computer and install the software, which is on a micro-SD card, which comes with an adapter for a full size SD card. This card should work in most computers. I found it best to copy the software onto my hard drive and install the software from there. My security software blocked it from installing from the memory card.  There are only versions of the XYZ software for Windows and the MAC. But not for Linux operating system. (I have one computer that uses Mint Linux.)  I installed the software on a Netbook which is using Windows 7, but could not get the software to run successfully on that computer. The netbook has limited memory and has a slower clock speed. So I installed the software on my main full-size notebook computer, which has expanded memory and an expanded hard drive. I connected the printer to my main computer and the software installed fine on it. At least, it did up to the point where it downloaded an updated version of itself. In updating, it also updated the firmware of the printer. My security software objected and the Update froze up. I later updated the software on my computer without the printer attached. The printer seems to work fine afterwards.  The software gives you the option of watching demonstration videos online. Regardless of having watched them before, it's a good idea to watch them with the printer in front of you and going through the motions with the videos. I had previously watched the videos, and I still learned some new things while watching the videos with the printer in front of me.  One thing that caught my attention was the amount of filament that you get with each spool. I compared the filament spools for this printer with the spools my other 3d Printer (The one that I have not gotten to work yet) and the special filament spools for the XYZ Printer Junior are a lot smaller.  The Junior only uses PLA filaments.  OK. Now I made 2 prints with the Junior. I simply downloaded a couple of objects from the Thingiverse.com website, and ran them through the XYZ software. Then saved them to a memory card in the XYZ file format. After that, I placed the memory card in the XYZ Printer and choose which one to print out. The printer does the rest. Nice and neat.  The 1st was the penguin in the photos. Not as detailed as I expected, but it was also a lot smaller then I expected.  The 2nd item was the mug. It turned out to be a lot larger then I expected. And I ran into an unexpected problem with using the mug afterwards. I filled it with a carbonated drink and let it sit on my table for about an hour. After awhile, I noticed that the color of the liquid drink was spreading into the color of the mug. The mug had been printed with a translucent white. As I watched, I realized that the liquid was seeping into the cell structure of the mug and the bottom was becoming moist. It also seemed as if the plastic was softening up. This may relate to the nature of the PLA plastic, I don't know. And this problem could probably be cured with some sort of coating. Again, I don't know.  Final: This printer was pleasure to setup and use, compared to the kit printer that I had previously purchased. But the XYZ Junior is going to cost far more to use on a day-by-day bases. Plus the issue of the plastic material becoming mildly porous has me questioning the idea behind this technology.  All in all, this printer is easy to setup and start printing with, and is fine for casual printing. Anyone should be able to set this printer up and be printing 3D objects shortly after opening the box. But you need a different printer if you plan on printing things every day.  Update Nov. 11, 2015 I've had the printer for a few days. I can honestly say that it's a please to use. Run your object .sti file through the XYZ software, save the resulting .3w file format to a memory card, put the card in the printer and print it out.  But it's no speed demon. I am uploading a photo of a coaster that I printed out. Each coaster too nearly 3 hours to print. I printed out a set of them. It's easy to get carried away in printing things with it. I am also uploading a photo of one of the coasters I sitting under one of my mugs to show comparative size. I either downloaded the sti file from the XYZ gallery or thingiverse.com. Not sure which location that the file came from. Both have an extensive galleries of files.  When printing things. it's good to be around the printer when it is finishing up printing your object. The LCD shows a countdown until the object being printed is completed. If you remove the item just after it is finished, then you object is easy to remove from the base. But if you wait awhile until it cools down, then it becomes very difficult to remove your printed project from the glass plate. (I discovered this the hard way when I let it print a project over night. I figured that it would be ready for me when I woke up in the morning. It was, but I had to remove the paper from the glass to get it off without breaking the glass.)  Speaking of the glass base plate. It is covered with a peel-&-stick paper from XYZ. It is also expensive, running about $1 per sheet. 3rd parties sell similar peel-&-stick paper for about the same price. The paper can be reused for additional projects up until you removed it from the glass or it becomes torn. I plan on experimenting with alternatives. The paper appears to simply be a special sized sheet of masking tape.  One other thing to watch out for. The vents to this printer are on the back. If you are like me and planning on setting up the printer up on a cabinet located against the wall, then you will have to leave some room between the printer cabinet and the wall so that air can flow through the cabinet. (I am also uploading a photo of the vents on the back of it.)  No doubt about it, this thing is addictive. I am finding all kinds of things fir it to print. But this printer could also end up being expensive too.  Update December 23, 2015 The printer has not been working for about 3 weeks now. Suddenly the prints started to fail. After a lot of time trying to check it out, it seems that heating element was no longer getting hot enough. This resulted in a clogged nozzle and barrel. Nor would filament go through the nozzle afterwards.  After multiple phone calls and messages with customer support, (with Customer Support saying that parts were on  the way to me, then amending that to say that the parts were not on the way) it is starting to look as if my printer will be out of commission for 2 months, at the earliest. And that is only if they actually send me a replacement part. (Something that I am skeptical about now.)  So I have a 1 star opinion of the XYZ Printing Customer Support right now. My opinion has dropped from 5 stars to 1 star.  Update: October 19, 2016  I sent the bad Print Head in to XYA for repairs on Dec 28th. About 6 weeks after sending in the bad print head, XYZ sent me a new replacement print head.  The printer started working fine again, for awhile.  2 months after receiving the new print head, I started running into issues with the printer printing only part of an object, then stopping the filament feed.  I made sure the bed/nozzle clearances were correct. I took the print head apart and cleaned the nozzle completely. I made sure that the feeding throat was clean. And I finally tried feeding filament through without any connection to the print head. Here I found out that filament was not even feeding filament through the tube.  I then pulled the extruder off and replaced the filament extruder motor. This did not help.  XYZ asked me to ship the printer back to them for repair, at my own expense. The local UPS store quoted me $189 for boxing, packing, and shipping.  At this point, the XYZ Jr. went into the closet and was replaced with a Wanhao I3 3D printer. I haven't had any problems with the Wanhao printer.  Bottom line, I received about 3 months of usage out of the XYZ Jr. printer. After that, it became an expensive paperweight.	-1
I've gone through two of these printers so far, waiting on my third and if that one is broken too I will return it for a refund and buy another brand of 3D printer.  The first unit I had arrived with the Z axis rail fallen out of the rods on the right hand side. After putting them back in I could still never get the Z rail perfectly level no matter what I tried, which caused issues when printing (obviously). I went ahead and put the printer through it's paces anyway to see what I could learn about the printer and it's construction and usefulness. I barely got through half the starter roll of filament before the extruder stopped working completely (it failed to heat up). The printer also has a last surface pass that goes very slowly, which causes the feed motor to get extremely hot (too hot to touch kind of hot). And the feed in general was inconsistent and the extruder would often jam up and cause the filament to 'pop' back when the feed motor tried to give it more filament (this is the 'popping' noise so many others have described). All in all, I got less than 30 hours of print time out of it, most of that horrible.  The second unit I received was broken in the Y axis. My first print was a round piece... but that turned out to be more like oblong. After investigating with a flashlight (since they cover up the Y axis belt so you can't see what's going on) I noticed the belt was very loose. So, since they covered it up with a cover and since you had to pretty well remove the glass and the bed itself to get to the cover and take it off... I grabbed my trusty torx bit and went to town on it. As it turns out, the pulley that is used to adjust the belt had popped out of it's socket. In short, there is a post that comes up through the center of the pulley and a plastic 'fork' that holds the post - sadly the post is so short that it can barely hold the pulley in place, and in fact after releasing the tension, popping it back into place and trying to re-apply tension to the belt... the pulley would simply pop back out again. After a bit of frustration and additional fiddling, I did get the belt to tighten up enough to produce rounder parts, though I hesitate to claim how round they would be considered under close scrutiny. I pushed forward to print some prototype parts I needed for a project I'm working on and continued to have to adjust the Y pulley between jobs. I also discovered that for the best possible quality and experience... unloading the filament, cleaning the nozzle and reloading the filament seemed to keep the extruder from jamming up as often. I was able to get about 60 hours of print time from this unit, but eventually, as the unit before it, the extruder stopped working altogether. I had contacted XYZ about purchasing a spare extruder when I returned the first one, but they wanted $100 for it, claimed they would post a link to buy them on their website and passed my information along to someone there who I expected would reach out to me to purchase one in the meantime. I haven't heard from them since. So, this one is going back too.  In both cases, the prototype parts I built did *not* print anywhere near the spec - often off by more than 1mm. So, trying to print interlocking parts with this printer is no bueno. I ended up refactoring my prototype parts to be bolt together instead, but ultimately even those tolerances were way off and the parts still did not line up as I would have expected, or at least hoped. I ended up printing a bunch of 3D Benchy boats in different sizes (see: http://www. 3dbenchy.com/) and broke out my calipers. Not a single surface was within tolerance, so that's a fail in my book.  I know, it's a $350 printer... one probably can't expect much in terms of quality and I understood that going in, but the build quality of these printers is just not there. I would have never engineered a printer using the kinds of tension pulleys and they did, and the fact that the extruders give out so quickly is really indicative of poor craftsmanship. I'd expect the extruder to last at least 200 hours before even starting to become worn (like, erm, every other extruder I've used), but 30-60 hours to die completely is horrible even by Chinese standards.  As others have noted - the proprietary filament is a big issue for several reasons... first, availability of PLA for the Jr is next to none. Natural, black, green and yellow are the only ones you'll find - and it's been that way since they started shipping these things. And you're lucky to get those when you can. It turns out you'll probably never get through a whole spool of filament before the extruder goes out anyway, so perhaps availability of filament is the least of the problems you'll experience with this printer. If you do manage to get through an entire spool, however, you'll find that you'll end up with 20 or more meters or filament that simply cannot be used. The system takes what it thinks a part will take to print (the estimated usage) and simply deducts it from the original (100m or 200m), regardless if you cancel the print, have a power outage, etc. In other words, it doesn't actually count the filament it is using, so you are left with a dead NFC chip and a bunch of leftover filament you can't print.  Adding to the lack of available filaments is a lack of available replacement parts, and based on my experiences thus far, I would say at the very least they need to make the extruder, motors, belts and pulley's available as these are all items that are critical to the operation of the system and, apparently, are prone to failure.  And finally, the 'no calibration needed' should come with a disclaimer... 'no calibration possible'. If the bed gets out of alignment, which given it's a flimsy piece of metal with a piece of glass bolted down to it and you have to use some bit of force to pry your parts off the bed... it's not hard to imagine tweaking the bed. And once that's done, there is no way to adjust the bed. Zip, zero, nada. There are three screws in the center of the bed that hold the thing on, but short of using shims around those bolts, which would still not produce a nice level surface due to their location, there is no way to adjust the bed to be level. While calibration of other printers can sometimes be a chore... at least you can calibrate them when they need it. This thing... not so much.  All in all I'd say save your money. I'm going for strike three because, well, I like torturing myself... but if I can't get one that isn't broken when it arrives, doesn't fry out the extruder before I can finish a spool of filament and can produce reasonably closer tolerances than what I've seen so far - then it too will be returned to Amazon and I'll just spend the money to build a RepRap instead. At least when I do need a replacement part I won't have to go far (e.g. to China) to find it then :)  UPDATE 7/9/2015 - I received my 3rd one of these printers and, once again, it was broken upon arrival. The z-rail had come off the track again. After several hours of taking it apart to put it back together, re-aligning the z-rail with the print bed, etc. etc. I finally got it to a point where it would print. This time, surprisingly, the extruder never gave out... nope, this time it was the feed motor for the filament - that started making horrible noise after just about 60 hours of use and died completely after about 90 hours. Sigh.  I also noted a couple other interesting... undocumented features. First... during one of my prints the printer simply locked up half-way through and wouldn't respond to anything except, of course, a hard reboot. There went about 10 hours of my time and about 30m of my filament down the drain. Another 'undocumented feature' would be that if you don't happen to be around to respond to the 'low filament' warning it gives you... well, then it just stops printing altogether. So, if you happen to be asleep in the middle of a 16 hour print, say, and even though you and I and everyone else whose printed with one of these things knows there's probably 20-30m of filament left on the spool even after the Jr thinks it's empty, never mind 'low'... you'll wake up with an unfinished job and no other notification about what may have happened... since it will say 'Job Complete'... even though you know it's clearly not.  The final word of caution I have for buyers here is the hidden 'restocking' fee Amazon is charging to return these boat anchors... it's about 1/3 of the price. Talk about rubbing salt in the wound... way to go Amazon... thank you 'standing behind me and servicing my account'.	-1
I knew a 3d printer that worked right out of the box was too good to be true, especially with it being so inexpensive.  The printer arrived with a multitude of problems that I have been working with their support staff to fix. The main problem is that the extruder just stops working a quarter of the way into the print. I didn't expect this printer to do wonders, but I did expect it to work. The support has been alright.  Although, It has been over a week of the issue not being fixed and no offer of replacement or refund. I am extremely disappointed with this product.	-1

came broken - red wire had disconnected from PCB. soldered it back on and it eventually broke off again, solder and pad are of very poor quality. Tapped another point and it does work with this repair. Funny enough the PCB appears to be useless and just a way to add a pot to dim the LEDs; could probably just remove the PCB and mount the pot in line.  Once it finally worked: image quality is poor. Camera is misaligned in the case so the LEDS reflect onto the lens making half the screen washed out. Part of image that works is also mediocre quality. camera is not sealed well, I would not use in a liquid scenario without adding something around the lens to improve seal.  However, there are some positives - works without driver in OS X and linux. However, in linux it will not work in mjpg mode, only YUYV which is more taxing on your cpu. Likely not an issue on most computers but if you're using it on something like a raspberry pi it may be too much (~85-90% cpu usage on a pi zero)	-1
the one I got was DOA. I wanted to use it to inspect my chimney between sweeper visits... was a good form factor and seems like it would have worked...	-1
to complicated .... I lost my money	-1
The bag this came in wasn't vacuum sealed like most filament bags, and immediately when switching to this filament I get popping sounds from moister. It prints, but because of the moister it's ruining my parts. And as a note, it says it needs a hotend of 250-255; but it works from 240 to 265 with no noticeable differences.	-1
Not as strong as expected. Made gears out of ABS, Taulman 910, and Taulman 618 with the same parameters. All lasted the same time (~1hr). Why would I want to pay a premium and go through the extra care to print nylon when it's no better than ABS...	-1
Most expensive disposable camera ever.  Purchased from Amazon September 22, 2016.  Worked great for fall 2016 and winter 2017.  Tried to use on January 4, 2018 and it wouldn't work.  Tried charging over night without success. Camera is as dead as the proverbial door nail and will not operate even with external power attached.  This is a toy, not a tool.  Save your money and do not purchase.  A year and a few months later the FLIR ONE is junk. Meanwhile the SEEK Thermal (purchased through Amazon November 19, 2015) still works fine.  Addendum: After writing this review, I contacted FLIR customer service and sounded off. Much to my surprise, I eventually wound up with a new replacement unit.  However the battery is still not replaceable and therefore this phone attachment is still an expensive toy, not a tool.	-1
UPDATE (JUNE/2017):  The new software for iPhone requires registration to use.  I have purchased the camera and DO NOT WANT to have to register with you to use it.  Sorry, I am not your product and I will not share with you metrics or any other things.  I am therefore downgrading the product to 1* as it has extremely OBNOXIOUS requirements to use.  STOP THIS STOP THIS STOP THIS.  This camera is a cute jewel!  It does a really nice job (when paired with the FLIR One App on iOS or Android) of combining the 640x480 visual color camera with the 160x120 IR camera into one image. You also have a lot of flexibility of how this is done and furthermore the information is kept separate so that the program FLIR Tools for iOS or Mac can then analyze and visualize and many different forms.  Overall I am quite impressed on how good the software is in taking the visual and IR images together and making it a "compelling story".  The only annoyance is that the camera cannot be used if the iphone is in any kind of a case.  The case needs to be removed or one needs to use an extension adapter or cable (have not tried yet but should work).  UPDATE: it works with a lighting extension cable quite well.  Another problem is that there isn't a lot of proper documentation on how to use these tools and the company website does not have any useful documentation either (though they are VERY nice responding questions).  When using the FLIR One iOS camera here is how to actually use the MacOS app (Flir Tools).  I presume that for PCs it would be similar.  1) Connect iphone to computer, open itunes and go to apps.  Go to the FLIR One app and download THE ENTIRE FOLDER Images. 2) Now you can import the FOLDER into this application.  And voila!  All the goodies work!  If you actually use icloud to download the photos (or any other means not described above) to your computer then all extra information is gone and the analysis applications do not work.  So you need to do the extra step.  It would be useful if one could somehow do things in a more practical way but I am now reasonably satisfied.  To FLIR:  please put better documentation up.  This will save you some tech calls/emails and reduce user frustration.  The FLIR One camera is a jewel and the software you implemented that blends optical and IR info is EXCELLENT.	-1
My first impression is not favorable.  It will hook up to the camera just fine but only without a case. If you have a case you will have to get an extension for another $20. FLIR could have done a much better design by having an extended lightning connector with an adjustable bracket to keep the camera tight up against the phone. This was very disappointing. Until I get the adapter, which is very small and likely to get lost and cost even more money to replace, I have to take the case off my phone every time. FLIR could have added on an extension with an tether to keep the extension from getting lost. It's clear that the engineers tested this in a lab and not in the real world. Engineers need to get out more often and experience real life.  I realize that a longer connector is subject to damage from having more leverage on it but they could have come up with a much better solution that they way it is. An extension will cause the same damage and leverage. To me, it might have been better to use the stereo plug but that may have not had enough ports to make this work. Or to use both ports that would have given it more stability.  The images are marginal even in room light. Resolution is very low and while it does okay for some situations it will not work well in the dark. That is a huge problem because to get accurate images in some cases there can't be any other IR radiation. I took some images of my house when it was pitch black and the image was so bad that it was almost unusable. It was just a blur around warmer spots.  If one were to take an image of a house, to look for heat escaping, in the sun it would show lots of heat escaping from the roof. That's because the sun is heating up the roof and in reality there may be very little heat escaping from the roof.  It did show some areas were the contractor didn't insulate a few areas and he will be coming back to fix that problem on his dime. I am also calling the city to complain about the inspector because he signed it off that the insulation was installed and installed correctly. So that is a benefit.  I did find several areas that I need to add a few pipes for my floor heating which is why I got this in the first place. The spacing between pipes is too much and I will add a third pipe to get more consistency in floor temperatures.  I am struggling to decide if I should keep this or not. The connector issue is a real deal killer for me. I can't believe that the engineers/designers actually let this get out on the market. It really shows some bad decisions along the way. Even a Bluetooth connection would have been a better option.	-1

The principle is not new- so the price was very appealing - unfortunately, the accuracy was not- I was having refrigerator issues and trying to get an accurate interior temp- the reading I got was 10 degrees lower than what registered on the  expensive meter the tech had- Just to make sure (this one said refrigerator was at 27 degrees) I left a bottle of water in the "27 degree" location for 3 days- not a sign of ice- so the Tech's reading of 37 degrees made much more sense. It went back....	-1

Far too small for the money.  As others have said you'll do better to get a simple hockey puck and if necessary cut a notch into it.  This thing is worth at most $3...	-1
Are you imagining this thing to be the size of a hockey puck?  It's less than half that size.  Really low-end finish -- lots of flash rubber still hanging off it.  Except where there's not enough rubber to the point that there are voids and you can see the canvas (?) structural stuff.  I returned mine.  I can dado a little groove through a piece of 2x4 and make a more trustworthy device.	-1

this is my second attempt to reach you. this was just working fine this morning but this afternoon stopped working. it won't register any readings, when i turn it on all i get on the screen is a green back lit, ph on left top corner, a number 1, and a dot. has this meter malfunctioned?	-1
I did not like this unit. It took forever to stabilize; I think there was something wrong with it so I returned it.	-1
This thing can not hold a calibration to save its life. I am not talking about months or days, mere minutes and the readings can start to shift. Just sticking with the chemical color change solution and having no problems. Probable a faulty one, but it still has turned me off to the whole ph meter idea.	-1
Unfortunately this product is not what I had hoped for. I know it's not a several thousand dollar ir camera but it's resolution is much less than expected almost seeming like a simulation nor does it seem accurate. Some color palates seem like they just choose colors at random to place over an item. It also has a very buggy app.  Tho they have made improvements,  to me this camera is  not practical for any kind of professional or amateur use yet. What they show on the website is not the picture you usually get. I wouldn't trust it for thermal leaks of a building or close up temp differences of an object. Not even for much of a general idea.	-1
I am a very experienced Thermographer. I've been handling these tools just about as they hit the markets in the 1980's in the Fire department when Scott came out with a bully black and white version. I've have personally owned 2 other IR cameras and Extech i5 and currently own a Flir Bcam 40.  I review items as I work or have used them for some time. So this review comes with over 25 years of real world use.  I have a loaded a few pictures to show this small Ir-camera is well worth the $$. It does have some draw backs but the cost most definitely out ways the draw backs.  Good; Cost, size for ease of storage or to carry around.  Easy set up, started right away and ease to change settings. Poor points; App fails and crashes frequently, usb pin length. usb orientation. Major Bad point; Battery goes dead. You will need a supplemental back up battery.	-1
The hardware seemed OK, but the software was garbage.  Wouldn't work in 3 different Android devices (Samsung S7 Edge, Nexus 9, Nexus 6P with proper USB-C adapter).  The one nice thing about this unit is that it came with Micro USB adapters so you can flip the camera 180 to face a different direction since Micro USB isn't reversible.  I ended up returning this unit and getting the Seek competitor.  So far, so good.  A note to FLIR.  Don't say that the Nexus 6P/5X are not supported.  Link to a proven adapter like Seek did; or even better, offer that adapter either in the box or as an additional accessory!  I really wanted to love this product, sadly disappointed.	-1
just got it, charged it, loaded flir from google play, plugged in camera...not so fast with the otterbox on.  didn't take that into account?  after plugging in, turning on cam, it gives a message that flir has stopped, with an option to report it.  that hasn't run for more than 2 minutes without freezing up.  has to be restarted.  not a good start.	-1

Only works with a few smartphones so the statement that this is for Android Devices is seriously misleading. I cannot even download the app to test if it will work with my particular smartphone. I waited 2 months and paid $250 to get this device and now it will not work. It says "Compatible with a variety of Android products" when it should say in bold letters "Only Works with a Few Android Phones!". In fact, researching on FLIR's website shows that this FLIR ONE only works with 5 specific smartphones. I was going to get a Samsung Note 5 but not sure if this FLIR ONE will even work with that phone. I should have read the fine print but when the headline is "for Android Devices" I took it at face value.  I've looked at what it would cost for a phone that will work with the FLIR ONE and upwards of $200 to $500. That is not worth the cost since I can get something like the Black & Decker TLD100 Thermal Leak Detector for $26 to help find leaks in my house that lose energy. I've used an infrared laser thermometer but the TLD100 has a neat feature that visually shows a temperature difference against your baseline (wall, floor, etc).  I did some more research and thought if I had Android 5.0 or newer then the FLIR One would work. I bought an Android phone with 5.0.1 and it still would not work with that phone. A friend has a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it worked with that phone but cheapest I can find an S3 in good condition is over $200 and that would make this FLIR one cost me $450 which is not worth that much money.  The FLIR ONE is a neat device and if you have one of the smartphones listed with the latest Android OS version and apparently the right USB port, then you are in luck. If not then you will have to upgrade if you want to use this imager. I'm returning mine to Amazon and buying the TLD100 instead. It may not be as neat and fancy but will accomplish the same thing, saving energy.	-1

XYZ cheats you on the weight. Charges same as others, but supply about 60% of the same material. One has to buy at least a Da Vinci Pro jr. to use third party PLA.	-1
Gets stuck on a regular basis. Too expensive to operate their printer.	-1
HORRIBLE!! The built in chip reads empty when there is almost 20% left on the roll. Normally, these filaments steal 10-15% but all of the black filaments I've tried end up with more than 20% left that the machine won't let you use. Very wasteful considering the price which is almost double what other brands charge.	-1
I purchased this filament for my Davinci Jr. Mix. I managed to use about 10 meters off the spool before I got the error (Unidentified Spool). I am giving it a 1 star rating since I cannot use it on the printer it was designed for. I did pull about 15 meters off of the roll and tried it on my Dremel and it does print well.	-1
The NFC chip that XYZ uses to force you to use their crappy PLA says that the spool is out when clearly there is more than half the roll still in the spool.  Every spool that I have had so far has 10 - 30 meters of PLA left over that the printer will not use because of the NFC chip.  XYZPrinting charges a lot for their low quality PLA and then the printer won't even use it all.  Is this company for real?  Anyway, I have tossed the printer (recycle bin) and will never buy anything from XYZprinting again.	-1

These resistors were definitely not what I expected: Wire is extremely thin, I can see some breadboards not making adequate contact. They are so thin, you'll bend them and rip them off from their group when taking them in and out of the bag. Additionally, three of the bags had rusted resistors inside. Some others had an oily residue. Not the best quality.  I'm giving it two stars just because there is a good amount of resistors, value range is great and price is not bad at all.	-1
I put my iPhone in one of these bags and sealed it and there was zero effect on my bluetooth device - the audio just kept going like nothing had happened.  The purpose of this "EMP" shielding is to isolate the device and it's a waste of money as far as I'm concerned.	-1

I have purchased at least 10 printrbot printers in the past, and I currently own 8 Printrbot printers.  I have purchased Play becuase I can easily move it around.  I got 2 printers - both assembled.  I was going to cut down on assembly time.  Both of the printers weren't assembled properly and required tinkering to get them going.  On the first printer, the wires weren't installed properly, so Z axis was stuck at 100mm, instead of 130.  I needed to cut zip ties, and then I was able to get the printer to work - goes up to 130mm (makes angry noises when it gets close to the 125mm mark).  On a second printer, hot end wasn't heating up - I checked and the wire was broken.  I removed the bad wire and replaced it with a new one.  Had to solder the wire to the connector.  Decided to replace the entire wire in case there are more breaks.  At least 2 hours of time wasted instead of 15 minutes it should take you to print on a brand new printer.  Complained to Help Desk, and got banned by Help Desk, because I logged a lot of issues in the past (20+ issues in 2.5 years).  Contacted Brook and he confirmed that Help Desk decision is right.  Avoid buying this printer if you are a first time user.  You will get frustrated, and your printer will sit untouched.  Otherwise I like Printrbot printers because you can buy upgrades.  Installed Y upgrade with heated bed on my simple.  I was able to print ABS, and PLA, and didn't have any issues with getting filament to stick to the printbed.  I am using kapton tape, and some glue, to help with adhesion.	-1
The Printrboard fried after about six months, probably because thee board itself is manufactured cheaply.  Printrbot said it was out of warranty, but the electronics shouldn't randomly go bad if they are made properly.  The mechanics of the printer itself are good (the auto-leveling is very nice), but if the board fries, the replacements are $70 from Printrbot.	-1
This product worked fine for two small projects then quit working. The Atmel board malfunctioned (Z axis quit in the run mode) so I got another board and it was dead. There is a warning that if you try to insert the micro USB cord and you happen to get it backwards it will blow the board. This is not a good thing when they give you a warning like this. I checked online and the Atmel boards (the only control board in the printer) sell for $6.17 ea. per thousand. So I returned the unit. I also had trouble with the extruder feed locking up because the cooling tube was sinking the heat away from the tip so I backed off the cooling tube one turn on the threads and expanded the chamfer on the tip input and it worked great after that. Then the Z axis quit. If a reliable control board was used in this unit (with a standard USB fitting) I would buy it again. JJK	-1

Less than 6 months of use. I had this connected to a climate control unit so it only came on when humidity was above 60% or the temp was above 90 which is rare considering I live in a very moderate climate. While this fan did work, it was very loud. You get what you pay for.	-1
At first I thought it might just be my new E3D print head and my inexperience with this ABS.  As I've been printing more and more with my new E3D and my older filaments, I'm beginning to realize that it's this filament that is giving me fits and is probably the filament I've read horror stories about.  This stuff refuses to bond from one layer to the next and it seems more brittle than other ABS I have.  I tried Inland to see if there was a cheaper alternative to some of the other plastics I've been using but I don't think I'll try it again.  If there's a trick to getting this stuff to work better, I'd sure love to hear it.  I also had a heck of a time getting this stuff to bond to my heated print bed.  I'll just have to save this stuff for my smaller prototyping and leave the good stuff for the parts I intend to keep.	-1
Cheap as hell and full of impurities! In short, this filament sucks. You Might get some good prints if you have a HUGE nozzle that can push all the bad filament impurities through it, but i have a standard .4mm nozzle and this filament's impurities clogged it almost non-stop.  I started using the filament with an E3D V6 1.75 mm with bowden addon and it printed lovely for an hour or so, then it started jamming every 20 minutes. Because the E3D V6 is so robust and powerful, it was able to fight through minor impurities in the plastic for a while, and it took me DAYS to figure out why my nozzle was jamming all the time, and why I needed vise like pressure on my extruder pushing the filament through. After days of debugging with the hot-end seller/E3D, temperature calibration, nozzle and heat break cleaning, I switched to some new filament as a last resort and viola! perfect prints, no jamming, after running for 10 straight hours, it's not the nozzle... it's the filament.	-1
Complete junk. Pulled on clip right out of package to test, three held semi-firm but fourth one came out of the clip. Must not have been crimped well enough. With this price I would expect the leads to be soldered. Also actual wire AWG (size) is very small perhaps 22 or higher. The covers are made from hard plastic and so signs of deformation after opening / closing 6 times and also prevent you from removing to solder the leads. These are going straight back and I recommend you avoid them. Very cheap quality.	-1
Three Shark Vacs in three years, all have failed. Twitter at Shark will not allow you to leave any negative remarks, this is proof they are falsifying.their reviews.	-1
4 out of 10 didn't works. These are not suitable for headphone booster, way too much hum and buzz at low value. Beryl able to drive 3 watt 4 ohm speakers, can't compete with a phone's built in speaker. The audio starts clipping at low inputs. Used one as a per-amp for a piezo pickup. As long as I didn't pluck the strings too hard it performed okay. 20 mm piezo disks can overwhelm the amp, causing it to clip, spit, and sputter. I got what I paid for.	-1
Received product faster than advertised, however it looks like a rework board due to defect or just plain low-skilled soldering to add discrete diodes & fuses. A set of jumper pins also missing. Not a total loss, but after reflowing & actually soldering one of the fuses (only 1 lead was soldered & none followed the plated-thru holes - obviously hand done, not waved!) - massive amounts of flux on board as well as solder spills here & there including a couple of dead shorts! Repaired, cleaned & drying - maybe I'll be able to test it in a few days.....after another good visual!!!!!! I would NOT recommend this vendor based on this item; perhaps I just received the bad one & all others are good, but I don't know.	-1
My I3 3D printer uses 24vdc and the RAMPS had 16vdc capacators	-1
Fully assembled? Yes, at least that was true (for me at least). Tested? I sure as hell hope not, I haven't even put power to this knowing that it will most likely destroy anything attached to it. The mosfets pins were not trimmed, there is an insane amount of solder specs and flux all over it, and the best part: I found a few connections where too much solder was applied and connects to wrong pins!  A couple of those pins were for the positive and negative power input!! Buyer beware: do not buy this board,  unless you like spending countless hours repairing them	-1
I know better than to buy cheap but I have an older also cheap pH pen that has worked fine for years, now I need to calibrate it a lot do I decided to get another.  I followed the instructions to calibrate this no problem. The problem is that it always gives wacky readings. It works fine in the calibration solution but I check its reading with my old one AND with pH testing drops and this thing is always incredibly high. I check with calibration solution and it's fine. I give up but will NOT trust this at all.  Maybe I needed to break it in but after a week or two it seems to be working better thus I changed my review. Still not sure I trust it though.  Update: it's going in the garbage. I thought it was actually working well but I don't anymore.  It's odd because it will read ok in the testing solution but not in water with nutrients or even tap water. Can't trust it at all.  It is too bad, I wanted to like it. The lit screen is a great feature. I give it two stars for a very easy to read screen.	-1
Stopped working for me. Even changed out the batteries. Piec of junk in my book. Was impressed at first but it just stopped magicially.	-1
I like cobalt glass, and my wife likes it even more. So, I purchased this to please her. It is really a beautiful piece of glass, and seems substantial. The dispenser on top looks real nice--however. When we first got it, every time after we used it, it would have lost the vacuum in the straw inside, and we'd have to pump it several times to get soap back up to come out.  So, I noticed that the straw was bent quite a bit, maybe a a half inch longer than the inside dimensions, so I snipped about a quarter inch off the bottom. It held its vacuum right away, and worked quite well for about a couple weeks. Then we noticed that after using it, it would slowly ooze soap out of the tip of the dispenser, and drip, drip, drip slowly on the counter, without seeming to reach the end of dripping. What a mess.  Sad to say, despite the really nice look of this product, it has been a GREAT disappointment, especially for the price.	-1
I'm not a big fan of drips...which is why I'm divorced (haha). That's also why I'm not a fan of this pump. I love the blue glass - it's a beautiful hue. It's nice and heavy - it doesn't slide around when your wet hand is pressing the pump. The sturdy thickness helps to prevent chips and cracks - and means the glass is not likely to break if it's knocked over or dropped. (Obviously the results will probably be different with a 10 ft drop versus a 2 ft drop. I'm guessing.) At 16 oz, it holds quite a bit of soap. I bought two of these dispensers - one from Sally's Organics that is blue glass and has the "modern" pump, and one from Industrial Rewind that is clear glass and has the "traditional" metal pump - and I am SO much happier with the other pump. http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XLV7NM8?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_46  I use both of these dispensers with the generic version of Dial hand soap, not dish soap. I noticed the dripping issue with this dispenser by the end of the first day, but was kind of trapped by that point. You must fill it in order to check the drippiness factor...however, filling it means it's gonna be a LOT of work to return it! Mine would have gone back the next day had my lack of excitement at cleaning out a dispenser full of soap not been so...tenacious. Instead, here I am - about a week later - back on Amazon, searching for a pump similar to the one on the other dispenser - the one I mentioned above. I saved $5 by ordering this dispenser over the other one, but it's going to cost me more in the long run, in time, frustration, and money. No bueno.  The positive of this whole thing is the great customer service provided by Sally's Organics. I did not contact them about this dripping pump because I knew, without even speaking with them, that I did not want to empty and clean the dispenser in order to return it (It would have taken forever to get rid of all those bubbles). So I can't speak to the way they handle problems, but I do know they strive to make your purchase pleasant with their nice packaging and welcoming emails.  Bottom Line: I wanted to like this - I really did. I love how big it is (so I'm not constantly filling it up) and I think it's beautiful, with a slight twist of funk. If a dripping dispenser is not what you want though, I strongly recommend purchasing something different. In my experience, this drips down the bottle (not directly on the counter), leaving you with a slippery bottle (covered in gloppy soap) that does not go well with wet hands trying to pick up, or move, this dispenser.  UPDATE (11.15.05): I did purchase a new pump dispenser for this item. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X8XIJ9U?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s01 Although I'm not thrilled that I had to spend additional money and time on replacement pumps for a brand new soap dispenser, I am totally thrilled with the new pump! It works perfectly and hasn't dripped a drop. It releases the perfect amount of soap for hand washing. My advice: There are several other options available for this dispenser. Even though I purchased this dispenser for (what I thought was the bargain price of) just under $10, the $15 I spend on replacement pumps was ridiculous. There are other versions of this exact dispenser (only with pumps that don't leak, and silver coatings appropriately applied which don't flake off within the first few days of ownership) for around $15. Please don't waste your time and money like I did - but if you are looking for good pumps, I highly recommend the pumps I listed above. I hope someone finds this information helpful.	-1
I've only had this for a couple of days - consider this an initial review... The product looks very nice. The materials - glass and chrome plated pump - are solid feeling. The pump works. The capacity is actually quite large. Now, it just has to last. ========== Update March 1, 2016 Well, as noted in other reviews, it does look great, but the pump stopped working after pushing not more than 4 oz in total of soap. That's really too bad. You will notice more reviews that say the same thing. I would not order this again.	-1
This review is for HealthyWiser pH Test Strips 0-14, Universal Strips To Test, Urine, Saliva, Water, Alkaline Diet, Pool, Hot Tub, Hydroponics, Garden Soil, Aquariums, Kombucha Tea  We are used to PH strips for body and pool so I was interested in trying a new brand. We tried these HealthWiser strips in water, 2 human mouths, urine and the pool and none of it changed at all. I will be continuing to test these as needed and I will let you know what happens.. all these people cannot be full of it, right?? Some of these things must work???  Besides that, even though the bottle and box are blasted with information, there is no info pertaining to the actual use and what all the boxes mean. Very confusing.

According to the Amazon description, these can be used to test the pH of soil.  But the instructions on the container say they can only be used on liquid or gel.	-1
This filament looks great if it was wound correctly on the spool. It has become crossed over on every single model that takes more than 1hr to print. I have the same filament in red and don't have the problem so I guess I got a bum spool. I'll tell you, having the filament tangle and strip on the feed gear 5 hours into a 6 hour print will make you go NUTS!	-1
Crap right out of the box. The ph adjustment screw doesn't work at all so unit can't be calibrated.	-1
Started reading inaccurately after one month.	-1
Updated my review. Stopped working after two weeks. Stay away.	-1
Straight from the shipping container, the unit's lower half, including the black "removable" cap was covered with a dried, white, granular substance like what you might get if you let a heavily sugared liquid dry in the sun.  Couldn't get the cap off without destroying the unit. A lot of these Jellas pH meters are returned for various valid reasons.  I think that Jellas just resells them without any kind of quality control inspection.	-1
it was not working correctly, several times I had to remove the batteries and reinstall them to get it to stop flashing crazy numbers. I stopped working all togetherr, I noticed the glass on the bottom probe area was cracked, i have to get another one :(	-1
Failed after 30 days, so I can't return it.  I would not buy it again.	-1
horrible. Support WILL NOT answer your questions even if your bot is completly broken.	-1
Got my assembled printer and it didn't print right out of the box.  Y axis belt was over tightened during assembly and the prints are rough, there is some slippage in y direction - prints are U shaped.  Contacted support and was told that my 90 day warranty was voided.  Printer received a Make award, but your experience is hit and miss.  I had a Simple Metal before which I built from kit and it worked well.  I have built 10+ 3D printers from kits and got majority of them to work.  Hot end is also leaking PLA.  These printers still take a lot of time to get them to work if they are not assembled properly.	-1
I have tried both the rotating brush and oscillating brush electric toothbrushes. I strongly prefer the oscillating which this Philips Sonicare is not. All it does is vibrate and vibrates my whole mouth which is unpleasant. Perhaps the vibrations do help loosen trapped particles but it is just not pleasant to brush with this toothbrush.	-1
This is my first electric toothbrush and I generally like it, however it's impossible to activate the whitening setting...so I feel like I paid extra for nothing. I was told Philips Sonicare was the best electric toothbrush brand, but I find that hard to believe...	-1
UPDATE:  Dropping the stars to 2. After 1 year, it stopped working. The battery no longer charges.  Very disappointing considering the price of this toothbrush.  Too bad, because I loved it.  I like the Sonicare toothbrushes.  I feel they clean my teeth far better than a regular toothbrush.  As far as a comparison to the other sonicare I have, I find no difference in effectiveness.  I do like the different speeds. I feel that's a bonus to someone just starting to use an electronic toothbrush.  I remember getting my first one; I beat my teeth up because I wasn't used to the vibrating.  Had I been able to start with a slower speed and built up, it would have been much better.  My kids didn't like their Sonicare toothbrushes for this very reason. I feel this one will be better if they start with the milder speed.  I prefer this slimmer toothbrush vs the other one that is wider.  It's also a lot cleaner than the Essence.  There are no hidden spots for nasty build up in this one.  The drawback to all of these electronic toothbrushes is the price of the replacement heads.  At $10 or more per head, this makes this toothbrush unaffordable to many people.	-1
Not my favorite	-1
They are a terrible design. They are too thick and break off as you try to push them in place.	-1
No sticking power.	-1
This is the worst filament I have ever used and I have tried a couple. Parts printed are very weak and de-laminate with any force at all. Stay away. If this wasn't a consumable I would be looking to return this ASAP.	-1
It extrudes, but that's about it. I have so many wraps on this roll it's going in the trash. First bad roll of inland filament I've gotten, thought it might have been a freak occurrence, but it then had a wrap on a 54 minute test print as well. Guess this stuff isn't as good as the higher volume black? Have not seen these issues with other colors.	-1
This PLA is only 1.65mm diameter.  It has a very strange texture, really rough.  I'm used to using Hatchbox PLA, but they were sold out, so I bought this instead.  My test print with it turned out awful.  I do not believe that this PLA is any good.  I am going to try to return in to the seller.	-1
The filament prints well, but the black color is somewhat muddy, sort of a very, very dark gray.  I compared it to some premium filament and it's a significant difference.  Not the first time I've bought discount black filament and experienced this - maybe the manufacturer is saving a bit of money on pigment?	-1
Warning they list this as PLA but they send PLA+ which DOES NOT print the same as PLA and I have nothing but failures so far with it, even after trying to adjust the heats to compensate for it.  Strings galore even with retraction set in small steps all the way up to 4.5 with more strings then a guitar per level.   The color is dull, it is almost a dark grey it is so dull of a shade, my spool of 3dSoultech black which is actual PLA prints perfect with no strings and is a bright and shiny black.	-1
Very poorly spooled, ruined several unattended prints before I realized the printer was trying to pull filament from under several other layers on the spool.  Still deciding whether to throw it out or save it for times I can sit and watch my printer.	-1
Prints fine when it will spool freely, but as others have noted, the way this was wound on the core is sloppy, Sloppy, SLOPPY! Jams that occur during large print jobs make this stuff totally worthless.	-1
This is the worst pla I have ever used save your self the trouble and money and DO NOT BUY	-1
Terrible. Nothing but failed prints, non-adhering layers. Definite additive smell. Returned it. stay away.	-1
wow this stuff sucks it looked decent but I keep running in to problems #1 it clogs so easily even with oiling #2 the filament breaks easily #3 it gets chewed by the extruder in every print #4 the prints come out with holes and drips (I print at a decently stable 200c) take my advice and avoid this filament	-1
Updated review. This filament prints good, but it for some reason turns to dust in my extruder which then causes issues with filament jams. It coats the extruder hobbed gear with a white dust that prevents a good grip on the filament. No other Inland filament does this.	-1
3 of my 5 spools got tied into a knot.  There is an obvious manufacturing problem.  The roll was actually pulled into the printers because of the tension.  If you have this filament laying around, be very careful.	-1
Beware the formula change - previously printed fine, but now I've had to raise my nozzle and bed temperatures to get it to stick to the kapton tape.  On PEI it's a little better - but the new formula just refuses to behave and stick to the bed.  Warps off a kapton sheet with gluestick in just a few layers.  I had to raise my bed temperatures to 85C to get it to stick to PEI.  And nozzle temps past 230 are necessary to extrude it.  Other reviewers have tried 245.  Half a kilo down the drain with failed prints left and right  Packaging on the box is the same for both - but the old formula came in a vacuum bag without a ziplock, and had a solid filament spool.  The new formula has a ziplock bag and uses a honeycomb structure in the center of the spool.  PS - I've probably used around 30-40 kgs of the old formula with no issues past the initial testing phase, and the old formula printed great at 215/60 on a PEI sheet.  Note: MicroCenter (shipped and sold by them) processed a refund without any fuss.	-1
I have purchased this brand in the past with good results. However, this new batch should be avoided. Prints do not bind well and crumble apart when you pick them up. At first I thought it was something with my printer or software. But using a different filament yielded a perfect print. I will be returning this.	-1
I printed 3 small items.  They all printed brittle and the layers have gaps. Very noticeable gaps of missing filament in prints. Their black filament does not do this. I noticed with the white filament only....I had to move my MP Mini Select V2 Extruder tube around just to get the filament to go through. So brittle feeling. I will post a picture of their filament vs another Priline. I printed a Mario Kart.	-1
I've gone through 20 + Rolls of plastic never had a quality problem until I bought two rolls of this cheaper plastic turns out you get what you pay for the quality is terrible I've tried different temps and change the tips on the printer with no help this plastic just prints crappy I went back to the original plastic I've been using for two years and no problems at all. this plastic prints like it has air bubbles in the plastic quality and look of product is very cheap and not useful at all	-1
Not great. Terrible layer adhesion at anything lower than 210c. Even at that temp its adhesion is subpar. Good color and extrudes fine, but requires strangely high temps. I've had other Inland filament (blue) that also requires unusually high temperatures for even decent adhesion.	-1
Tends to clog and warp better off with a roll of hatchbox	-1
I have finally got into using the Blue from Inland.  This color out of all the colors is very low quality.  Nice color but everything I make breaks very easily.  I will be getting my blue in another brand.	-1
This filament requires unusually high temperatures for pla to get good layer adhesion. I had to print at 230 which is my normal abs temp. I haven't tried any prints that require the cooling fan but im certain this will effect print quality.  Edit: I cut my rating in half. The more I use this filament the more I hate it. Even at 230 there are layer adhesion problem on thiner walls. The final straw during a print I discovered that filament had been poorly wrapped on the roll with the inner layers overlapping outer layers causing it to bind and stop extruding.	-1
Normally I have a good luck with Inland filament (being a micro center brand) but this stuff kept getting clogged in my hotend because the filament doesn't measure exactly 1.75mm, it ranges from 1.68mm to 1.81mm. I won't be buying inland from amazon again (only in-store at micro center.)	-1
Oh dear God  the mess! First, the little plastic boxes just POP right open at the least provocation and scatter little balls ALL OVER!  So I used the floor sweeper picked most of the  up in the dust pan. Sorted out all the dirt and crap  then got them back in the little plastic boxes then I scotch tapped them shut so it would not happen again. So another week goes by and I see them start into turn color  so I popped it in the micro for 5 minutes. Melted the little plastic case down and my micro was full of little loose beads. Straight into the trash can this time!  Total waste!	-1
I did what the instructions said and microwaved these puppies to dry it out....even set it to low power (1) and microwaved for 60 seconds. They melted a bit, so I picked them up and the silica beads dumped out everywhere from a giant melted hole in the bottom. Garbage, absolutely NOT microwave safe.	-1
This filament is softer than Hatchbox. My extruder gear grinds this filament up and causes it to under extrude. I have no issues with Hatchbox, but it I have 3 spools of this stuff and it is very inconsistent. Next time I won't try and save a few bucks and get what works all the time as this cost me more $$ in the long run having to clean out my extruder gear than Hatchbox has ever done.	-1
I am seriously impresses with this Yellow PLA by Inland. I removed some Hatchbox Green PLA in the middle of the print and switched to this yellow. Not only did it print better than the Hatchbox Green but it seems to smell better too. I ended up reprinting the whole thing due to it being just BETTER QUALITY.  Printed at 210 celcius; .28mm; Bed Temp 70 Celcius; Cooling Fan 100%; Simplify 3D; MacPro; FlashForge Creator Pro (New)  Update: After several prints I have realized some new things. - stringy - requires a bed temp above 80c is not enclosed or will warp worse than ABS - requires maximum nozzle temp of 220c just to get it to stick to the bed - MIGHT AS WELL BE ABS What in the heck did I get my self into with this product?! Going to do some massive prints with it to get rid of the darn thing. Bye Felicia!	-1
No happy with this filament - doesn't consistently print, and its lack of smooth texture picks up a lot of dirt which in turn ends up in the print.	-1
Material is not glossy on the spool, it is very very rough and dusty.  Material is not smooth either,  entire roll looks as if it was dragged through a set of gear wheels.  Attempting to run within the recommended material specs results in delamination,  globs of material everywhere and severe stringing.  I tried drying it for 12 hours and it did  not improve the situation.  After discussing it with the community (3D Printer Cult EXTREME) on Facebook the consensus is this is bad material,  other people in the group have had similar experiences.  EDIT:  I just threw away print number 16,  switched to MG Chem PETG and printed the same item with no problem.  After careful consideration the material will be sent back for a refund.	-1
Received their black ABS filament instead of this clear. Still giving 2 stars because it is still good filament	-1
Not so good this filament worked when it wanted to clogged a lot never had so much trouble i bought it over the hatchbox with i usually get saved 6 bucks not worth it should have gone with what i know works. Just to make a note I'm not a newbie at 3d printing Ive been printing for some time now  I'm a Engineer for almost 20 years I know how to solve problems and I build CNC machines from scratch from mechanical to electrical to programming, i even build Computers to run the machines. I don't like to give bad reviews but no matter how i set my printer i could not get good results from this filament i would not recommend it.	-1
Never really got to use this. It would jam consistently after a few seconds of use. It was cool for a few minutes.	-1
Worst customer service ever.  Our 3Doodler arrived June 4th and was defective.  They use a "ticket system" for problems but support staff is non existent.  When I expressed concern that the url to register the product was not valid, they told me not to worry about it.  I'm out $200 for the pen and accessories with no recourse. It's defective.  Do not buy this product.	-1
Printed ok for cheap filament... first layer was pretty bad but I got a 2 for 1 deal. Won't buy again.	-1
This stuff is kinda bad quality. Got it during the Buy one Get 2 free deal, This filament does not like any type of retraction or else it will jam up failing the print. I was hopping for better results.	-1
I've used ABS, PLA, PLA+ and recently, PetG. I have the Inland Magenta PetG which prints flawlessly, yet this e-Sun white is killing me. I must have tried dozens of configurations and either it warps, moves off the glass plate ignoring the always reliable hairspray layer, or goes up on to the nozzle, causing a disaster. I've gotten one object to print  with this white PetG perfectly, and with the exact same settings, I printed the the same object minutes later, only to result in one of the aforementioned horrors. Life is too short to fiddle to death with this. Other e-Sun (PLA+/PLA) print without a hitch... this white needs an exorcist.	-1
very abrasive and did not get good prints, may be my settings though. I would not buy it again	-1
Its been good so far but the filament was cut halfway through which luckily ran out after the print was done, if that had been a larger print it would have ruined it.  update: we'll it finally ruined a print, a long print, heres a picture of where they made the spool so that it formed a knot that ultimately caused the filament to snap out of the extruder from being grounded down on for so long. Filament is great, QC is what you would expect of the chinese.	-1
Was about 75% through a 19 hour print and found out the printer was printing in tin air. Found the cause. The filament was tangled on the spool so obviously lacking in quality control. No more of this product!	-1
Normally, this filament has been tops for me but this roll has the worst diameter inconsistency of all. It should have been disqualified at quality control. I didn't see the problem until halfway thru a twenty hour print that failed as the filament drew fat and broke the print free from the platen.  I measured at the stopping and the filament was almost 2mm!!!!!!!!!! I'd send it back but half the roll was consumed only to fail Gonna have to give the PETG a wide berth so I don't waste time again	-1
This stuff just doesn't behave like PETG. As others have described, it doesn't bridge well and it is extremely brittle, far worse so than even cheap PLA. I've got 4 other rolls of ESUN filament on hand and this spool/packaging looks the same as the others, but this stuff came with 2 color pamphlets which have lots of spelling errors. None of the other ESUN products I've ordered have had these pamphlets, but this is the latest order so perhaps they just started adding them? The bag the spool was in still had vacuum, the filament doesn't pop like it has been water damaged and the manufacture date shows as 2017-11-04 so it isn't old either. I tried temperatures from 230-250 and it is beautifully shiny but very brittle no matter what temperature. If you want shiny black filament for a display piece this might be up your alley, but if strength of the finished parts is important to you I can't recommend the Black ESUN PETG. This is the worst filament I have ever used, and that includes the cheap junk they include in the box with cheap printers.	-1
Compared to Black PETG from PRUSA this filamnet is a nightmare. I have better results with hatchbox PETG or ABS. My first black eSUN PETG printed great, the following ones not so much.	-1
Full of moisture, not printable. Missed return windows by 1 day. Usually a great product. Not this one.	-1
The entire spool was tangled, I had to transfer it to another spool. it prints well but not worth the trouble of untangling it.	-1
I have a lot of trouble setting the print setting to match this filament. There is a lot of flaw in my prints: It does not extrude nicely, it doesn't stick well even with the bed even with 85 degrees bed covered in painter's tape, creating massive wrappage. It is NOT as easy to print as PLA like other says.  Furthermore, filament cooling fan would cool the filament too fast, leaving weak bond between layers. That weak bond makes the model weaker than PLA.  In conclusion, I do not recommend using this filament if you're not willing to experiment.	-1
eSUN PETG filament is just like any other PETG, once you configure your printer to handle the special needs, it works fine. All PETG are very viscous and requires more cleaning and more refined setting on infill and first layer. I print on glass, at 95c, Hotend first layer 255c and 236c for the others, this way I don't need any dressings or treatments on my glass. First layer width, 175% and hight 175%. Infill Extrusion width at 140%. My extruder is .40mm,  Ext multi .99 and Width .48mm. This will get most of you started if you never worked with PETG before. The eSUN PETG is as good as any other materials, the tolerance is not the best, but it has never jammed my extruder because of tolerances. What I do find extremely frustrating is that I have to babysit the spool all the time, for the way it is wound, jams on the spool. Un-jamming takes some skills as not to kink it enough to become an issue, jamming the hothead. If I was to purchase another spool, I would re-spool it to reduce jamming by entanglement. Making the price per spool less then desirable, do to the extra labor. I think I will stick with HatchBox PETG.	-1
Started bubbling and popping out of the box. not recommended	-1
This filament operates over a vast temperature range (~17C - 205C) but strings on all of them. Very poor results overall.	-1
Inconsistent quality. Brittle spots in the spool. May be a bad batch? Seems others have had the same issue with this particular color. Every large print I tried with this material failed due to inconsistent extrusion.	-1
This stuff is kinda bad quality. Got it during the Buy one Get 2 free deal, This filament does not like any type of retraction or else it will jam up failing the print. I was hopping for better results.	-1
Works but spray is too strong and difficult to modulate. The degreaser does not evaporate so you have to wipe it off. I compared it to $3 can of another brand and that cleaner did just as well and evaporated completely.  The cheap competitive cleaner also had a traditional nozzle that was very easy to control the intensity of the spray. This WD-40 degreaser might be very good for some applications but there are cheaper alternatives that in some are much better. I also think it is way overpriced compared to any of the competition, almost $5 higher, too much for just for the advantage of having the straw built-in. I also think most WD-40 products are over-hyped and there are other products just as good and in many cases a lot better. I use a gelling grease that is liquid on application and turns to a grease a short time later. It works much better than WD-40 to lubricate bearings, locks and just about anything that turns or moves. I've also tried WD-40s Rust Penetrant and was not impressed.	-1
I've had this printer for a month, but actually only used it 8 times to print a model 0.5 inches tall by 0.75 inches wide.  Now the printer will not print anymore.  I have tried everything to get it to work, Calibration, cleaning the resin tank (wasting very expensive resin in the process), adjusting the laser strength, but nothing works.  I also contacted XYZPrinting Support to get it fixed or replaced, but the only thing they have done is tell me they are sorry.  I had high expectations for this printer, but it has turned out to be nothing more than a $1641.41 piece of junk.  Buyers BEWARE!!!!	-1
Never buy anything from xyzprinting they will not honor their Warranty if the product is defective and they have zero support if something goes wrong with the product. Worst company ever. Never ever buy anything from them ever.	-1
With nearly 20 years of experience with 3d printing i think my expectations of a $1500 sla printer were reasonable. I have had this thing for a few months now, gone through 2 bottles of resin and one resin tank and have yet to get a single usable part from it.  When i test small parts on high resolution and the machine actually works the parts look great but it almost never works.  When i first got the machine it would buzz very loudly for a few minutes when powered on, i submitted a service ticket to XYZ on this issue and never got a response, fortunately the loud buzzing just seemed to go away one day.  Using the auto-fill feature cause the resin bath to over fill, i have found resin ON TOP of my build platform as well as under the resin tray and on the glass above the laser assembly.  Not to mention the auto-fill pump is absurdly loud.  Most of my prints that have started do not stick to the print bed causing a waste of material and wear on the resin tank. Standard response from XYZ on this issue is to try re-calibrating the print bed with no resin in the resin tray. This means you have to dump resin back in to the bottle which is an absolute mess AND this defeats the NFC tag that monitors resin use. I have nearly 3/4 of a bottle of resin but two bottles that the machine reads as empty.  Software is buggy, I am running windows 10 on a fairly robust machine built for CAD work. The software crashes a lot, can take a long time to import and manipulate parts and  currently i can't print anything because the software will not complete the slice operation and send the file to the printer. I just canceled a slice operation that was running for 17 hours.  When i first got this machine my computer wouldn't recognize the machine at all, XYZ support questioned my USB cables and recommended i just load files via thumb drive rather than offering any solution. Then mysteriously after a software update my machine could suddenly connect.  In the grand scheme of quality 3d printers this is a very inexpensive machine but it just doesn't work. If there was a good support system and i could make it work i would be less critical.	-1
NO RETURN/ NO REFUND. The machine I have has yet to print anything usable, it makes a loud metal slapping sound, and the parts fall into the vat during printing and become lumps of resin. Talked to tech support for a week before trying to return it, when I did they said, NO RETURN/ NO REFUND on used machines. How was I to know it was junk until I used it? now they won't take back a faulty machine, and I'm stuck with an expensive hunk of junk.	-1
Poor machining, mine had burrs on the inside from when they machined the set screw through hole. Also it has a different outside diameter from my original so if I want to even try to use them I'll need to adjust my extrusion rate.	-1
The small tools broke almost immediately when lightly milling acrylic plexiglass sheets.	-1
These are junk, they chatter and destroy themselves on aluminum.  Don't buy them unless you are cutting plastic or something very soft.	-1
I used the 1/2" inch for rough milling on some brass stock and it performed as expected. I tried using the 3/8" mill on some Stainless steel and the tool burned up on a very light cut at recommended speed. The rest will be useful for roughing cuts on soft metal but I will stick to better quality from now on.	-1
Why Bother With Reviews, Amazon deletes the truth when it hurts.	-1
Tried  2 small clamps for fuel hose , neither  would tighten, thru out the whole box , made in china !  buy USA clamps only !	-1
These are of extremely poor quality. Two have broken. I went to the hardware store and showed them and they laughed and said I needed clamp that is better made. They do not sell this cheap of a produce because they may of may not work.	-1
This filament is very frustrating. It is way softer than expected and I can't seem to get it to print with any kind of quality. I have ordered other hatchbox products with great success, but this just doesn't seem to work for me. I wish I could exchange it!	-1
I have purchased over 50 spools of Hatchbox filament and it is usually very easy to work with. Lately, I've been using Chromatica-3D PLA filament, but I needed a color they don't offer, so I purchased this and re-calibrated the flow rate on my printer for this spool. The settings are generally the same as they are for other Hatchbox spools.  This has not been a typical Hatchbox spool, though.  So far, out of 8 attempts, I have had ZERO successful prints.  The print head was clogging within the first 10 layers of a print so I turned up the temperature a bit to 200.  This in-turn created a major stringing problem and I was still getting clogs. The one print that did complete had significant layer adhesion problems, which is really weird considering how high the hot-end temp setting was.  I purchased this from Amazon and the spool was still in a tight vacuum when I unloaded it, so I'm really not sure what the issue is. I tried another Hatchbox spool I had and it was OK.  I since switched spools back to the Chromatica-3D stuff and prints have been fine.  So maybe I just got a bad spool.  Still....poor filament, for whatever reason, warrants a poor score.	-1
Another roll of Hatchbox which I've had nothing but trouble with.  I've tried printing at 200, 205, 210, 220 and at each of these temperatures, it causes a feed jam.  This material extrudes nicely and the color is wonderful, I just couldn't ever get it to work at any temperature.  It is also much more easy to break on the roll than other PLA.	-1
It's difficult to print and is basically a structurally weak brown PLA. I've seen better wood filament.	-1
It totally clogged my 0.4mm nozzle after only 2 prints. Others have posted similar complaints, but I thought it would be fun to try. It's impossible to print with this filament for any length of time. It has too many small particles embedded in the PLA. Of course, I knew it wouldn't look like real wood, and it doesn't. The manufacturer NEEDS TO BE VERY SPECIFIC about the print requirements (nozzle size, temps, speed). I have made hundreds of prints in PLA and ABS and never had a clog. I wasted $37 on the filament, and it cost me $12 to replace the clogged nozzle and hotend. Now I'm stuck with a big roll of filament that I'll never use again. Listen to what everyone is saying about this. DON'T BUY IT!	-1
These are the worst drywall anchors I've ever used. The teeth fold over instead of biting into the drywall, and if you are actually able to get one to expand, the threaded section inside breaks off, leaving you with a useless piece of metal embedded in your wall.  Yes, I know all the little tricks to get them to expand and not spin in the holes. They're all useless on these. Stay away and get some other brand.	-1
DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON, WENT TO USE PRODUCT AND IT WAS SOLID, COULD NOT EVEN PUNCTURE SEAL IN TUBE. TOTALY USELESS. UNABLE TO READ FADED EXPIRATION DATE. LOVE GORILLA GLUE PRODUCTS BUT WON'T BUY THIS AGAIN ON LINE.	-1
Im not an expert caulker and I like things perfect so when I was done I knew Id have a place or 2 to fix. It dries pretty quick.... I was caulking around the tub... I wasn't even going excessively slow, Im talking within the minute it was drying up. Normally that would be a good thing, not in this case. After applying and waiting a couple days one of the spots looked like it had a thin overlay on it. I rubbed on the flaky spot and it peeled off and just kept going and within less than a minute the whole thing and all my work was gone. Back to the regular silicone for me and is now perfect and sticking the first try. The only thing I liked about this caulk was that it dried a bit harder than the silicone and wasn't as shiny. It kind of just blended right into the tub and tile. This is the first Gorilla product out of many that I have been disappointed in.	-1
These are fairly low quality connectors. Not quite what I expected.	-1
Jam after jam.. QA on these aren't very good.. tight winding and the tolerances were very much off. Returning and never buying again.. beware, especially if using E3D as it will jam up nicely in the feed channel.	-1
Poor quality spooling , overly tight and binds.	-1
I found some of the instruments still in crude form and not finished example the dissecting knife was roughly sharpen and had jagged edges and was dull could not even piece of paper. The probes were also un finished the tip are bent off and catches and not straight.you can see the file marks. It look like these were made by hand in a hurry. The tweezers are all misaligned  I have no idea this kit had so a high rating unless I got the defective one.	-1
Tolerances are horrible and it'll jam up pretty good in most printers. Used on a Robo3d (with E3D v6 head), Custom RepRap (with E3D v5 head) and a MakerMini.. all jammed. Don't have any of these issues with some other filaments. Skip this vendor, you have been warned.	-1
Color is very, very close to Hatchbox silver when comparing perimeters to perimeters and solid fill to solid fills.  But it is a nightmare to try to stick to the bed.  I've tried everything.  This is my first time not using my usual brand and I won't be ordering any more of this.	-1
The color is amazing. Nice and rich purple. Unfortunately the filament causes the extruder to jam every time we have tried to print. Fail after fail of air prints.	-1
There was no set screw or any way to secure the thermister in the heat block so I couldn't get an accurate reading. Ended up having to use the heat block from my old hotend on this one. If it wasn't for that, I would have given it 4 stars.	-1
I needed a full-metal hot-end to print ABS or Nylon at high temperatures and don't worry about PTFE tubing issues. And also wanted to save some money on original V6 which is way overpriced (I don't see any tremendous engineering investments in a such simple thing).  It has two issues!  First and the BIG ONE, which makes this hot-end completely non-functional: The heatbreak in this clone is drilled to deep, so the plastic gets melted in a wider diameter area - above (before) the throat.  So kinda a melted ball of wider diameter gets formed then the filament and the heartbreak throat . Then on the first retraction it gets cooled, hardens a bit and blocks the filament to go any further. So, to make this cheap clone working I had to get&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/a-correctly-designed-heartbreak/dp/B01F82BMI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">a correctly designed heartbreak</a>&nbsp;(another cloned part, but correct one).  The second issue is not that big: The 30mm fan bearing got dead after some 20 hours of work, it produces terrible noise when the printer gets turned on until it spins a little to warm-up then in 5 min it turn into less annoying but still loud buzzing.  Two star is just for the price which I thing is really good for the parts you get all together (including bowden tubing and fittings)	-1
Description claims no ptfe in hot end.  Complete lie.  Amazon, remove this listing and seller.  This is not an all metal hot end and you would not know unless you removed the nozzle or got sick from the fumes.  Facts matter when it has to do with products that could potentially cause dangerous fumes.	-1
First issue, right out of the box, the thermistor lead was broken. The second issue which is a big one, my filament cant even fit into the heat break.  Somehow it is out of spec and I am using filament from another machine of mine, so the filament is good.  Minor third issue, this is a pre-assembled unit so why was nothing tight other than the thermistor and heater screws? Last issue, the bowden tube holder doesn't release the tube so once it is in, good luck removing it.	-1
I got four of them and the thermistor on all 4 were shorted together when installed.  Trying to use 3 of them on a Diamond Head.  The insulation was crushed by the screws by the factory and shorted out the 2 wires.  I added some Kapton tape on both sides to prevent short.  Obviously who ever tightened the screw had no idea what they were doing.  Can't seem to get the Marlin temperature table figures out right yet but I will. Others are telling me this is crap.  I am thinking they right.  Still have not got Any to work without jamming.	-1
You absolutely get what you pay for here. Will this work? Yeah probably. But the quality is absolutely nowhere near what you would get by paying more for a real E3D. The heat break on mine came bent and the heater block itself was threaded so crooked that part of the bore was still smooth. The heater block itself is clearly hand made (not a good thing when you're talking about machine equipment, really) and done so using a bandsaw. It's not symmetrical and is clearly made out of softer aluminum.  The heat sync is alright, though I imagine that's because it was probably made by a machine. The nozzle and all the bowden parts are also fine. Basically, if you are buying this to get "most of the parts you need" to put together a decent hot end, then the price is great. As an out of the box for a good reprap project, its garbage and you'd be better off with a j-head.	-1
Both ends are 5mm not 1x5, 1x8 as the description says.	-1
Not what i ordered both ends were 5mm. As advertised its supposed to be 5 to 8mm do not buy! someones trying to get rid of their junk couplers	-1
I want to love you PET. In theory you would have the strength of ABS with the printing ease of PLA but in reality:  - Clogging or slow prints. I've now tried 8 different reels of PET-G and PET-T and pressure seems to build and clog the nozzle during prints. I've improved the odds of a successful print by dropping the printer speed by 1/3 but then everything takes 1/3 longer to print.  - Terrible at bridging. Usually requires 5 to 6 layers on the top to get a clean surface. Again, more material and more time.  - Not biodegradable like PLA  My experience is based on: Four spools of eSun PET-G Four spools of Taulman PET-T "T-Glase" Lulzbot Taz 5 .05MM nozzle Lulzbot Taz 4 with all metal hot end upgrade and .03MM nozzle	-1
Poor quality but can't expect much for the money. 1/3 of the terminal screws were stripped out of the threads.	-1
These were supposed to be for my car repairs.  Prefer these on small diameter fittings.  On first squeeze, the ring lost its shape and did not return to its size.  The metal had expanded!  It was also really easy to squeeze.  I could a little with my fingers.  These are leaks waiting to happen, probably right after replacing.  I am not going to give it a chance, and lose my return window.	-1
This prints well but is so frigid it shatters like glass. Forget any structural integrity.	-1
EDIT:  Changing this from one star to 3, I liked it before and might like it again but I cant count on it due to ESUN changing the filament blend and not color matching previous parts and objects made with an earlier batch.  I will be changing brands for my go to cheap strong filament, might still buy ESUN for some things but knowing one spool to another of the same color may not match exactly I can't buy it regularly expecting consistency.  Single spool runs of objects and parts I know will not need to be reprinted later only.	-1
Very displeased, worked great for about 3 hours and now only works without stepper boards. Install the steppers and the unit goes dark!	-1
The kit was received with bent pins, holes in static bags, scratches in the screen. I went ahead and made the necessary changes to use the screen with my ROBO 3d, and it does work for a while, but keeps locking up my printer. Also when I get a full print, it will park the hot end, and then lock up again, leaving the hot end and heated bed running... I verified the G-code, and that is not the issue... appears to be a bad controller. I have learned my lesson, paid the tuition... now I will go buy a better controller.	-1
Never could get it to drive the stepper motors without tons of jitter. I think either the board or all the drivers are faulty. If it's me, I wish someone would explain the solution to me.	-1
So far my experience with this kit has been pretty mediocre. I am missing about 6 of the micro jumpers. I cant be sure if this board even works because of the missing micro jumpers and I also can't be sure if the stepper drivers work either. Pretty much stuck with a dud until I get those jumpers. I have contacted the seller and had no response.	-1
MESSY AND DOESN'T HOLD UP	-1
I ordered this for the 22 gauge wire. I don't recall seeing any sort of tester in the box. And I was seriously disappointed in the amount of wire when I saw the small spools.	-1
update #3: these sensors are inconsistent, poor quality, are not reliable, and do not return reliable readings... a replacement bme280 from the same vendor, DIYMALL, returns even worse (i.e., incorrect) readings than a previously bad sensor!!!! for example:  2016-09-24 08:59 83.1 30.1 65.7 <- first bad sensor 2016-09-24 09:01 88.3 30.0 60.3 <- replacement sensor  this is a variation of 5F and more than 5% RH... barometric reading seemed OK... *but* keep in mind, the *actual* wx conditions were:  81F with 87% !!!!  *avoid* these sensors from this vendor!!! they are not good, repeat, not good... they will fail intermittently and do not return results anywhere near ambient  i tested these again bmp180s, which were spot on in temp and barometric pressure... and i tested them against DHT22s - one of which was extremely accurate - while two others were bad sensors sold by a bad vendor - UPGRADE INDUSTRIES (avoid that seller)  Diymall generally sells good stuff, but i would highly recommend that you avoid these bme280s - they just don't work  Latest UPDATE: a second of these sensors, bme280, from Diymall, failed after 48 hours outside... apparently both couldn't handle high temps (90F+) or high humidty (80%+) - another inside is running OK... have ordered another batch to see if there's an anomaly..  UPDATE: i ran some comparison tests against other devices and found that the bme280 will read about 4F too high when used outside in 90F temps... barometric pressure seems to track with with bmp180s on hand... i will next run the bme280 against a DHT22 on hand  excellent device... using Matt Hawkins' excellent bme280.py script, i was able to quickly integrate the output of this sensor - attached to a Beaglebone Black and a MediaTek wifi dongle - to quickly build a wireless ambient weather condition monitor - i'll install a few around the house (inside, outside, in garage) and have the data bleeped to a local web server on the home lan - could also be used to set alarms or monitor the reefer storing my beer - for testing, i ran this sensor on the i2C bus with an ssd1306 oled - i will run some tests with other sensors to gauge accuracy	-1
Device stopped working after 8 months. Resetting device didn't help. Awair support is friendly, but unable to resolve the issue.	-1
Let me start by stating that I'm an active outdoor homeowner and gardener.  I use at least one hose every single day during most of the year (it was 96 here today), and I have three.  I have a very simple standard to which I hold my equipment:  It has to work, every time, all the time.  I have no time or patience for poor quality equipment, because when equipment fails, it costs time and effort to repair now and replace later.  And it usually fails when I'm in the middle of some project that I want to get done on a deadline.  Faulty hose equipment also costs even more money and wastes water.  I prefer to spend my money once, for quality, sturdy merchandise.  I have to say that I really liked this until it broke.  I've had it less than one season (a little over 60 days), and it just plain broke.  Initially it felt very hefty and sturdy, and today I was spraying fertilizer on the back yard when it simply snapped.  I was stunned.  Now that it's in two pieces, I can see that the main body of the valve is metal (the green and black part).  When you look at the hose threads on the orange part, they are made of metal.  However the piece that held the orange threaded section to the green/black body is made of plastic.  Cheap, weak plastic where you can't see it until it fails.  Oh...and the window to return it to the seller ended just under two weeks ago.  I'm glad that I did not write a rave review that I would have had to retract.  In my opinion this is not Tuff, Outback or otherwise.	-1
Not full flow as advertised	-1
I bought this wheel to sharpen my carbide drills. It does not work?? I bought a diamond wheel that does the job.	-1
This is the second one I purchased.  The first one broke within 2 months of using it.  This one didn't work straight out of the box.  Dont waste your money.	-1
poor alignment for the pins to the plastic openings. I have had lots of breadboards in the past and am very familliar with using them an many projects. These things have decent pins but the individual alignment is horrible to the openings. Getting a 32-pin chip to plug in is a downright task that takes several minutes of "fiddling" with the pins and alignment to get it in without bending half the pins. - If you can tolerate the mis-alignment they have, they aren't bad, but plugging in a large chip into one will frustrate you to no end.	-1
Got this one as a replacement as a replacement for an old Tektronics DSO I had. This Rigol is  feature rich, very affordable and has 4 channels so seemed to be a good choice. However, when it arrived I didn't like it at all. First it has a continuous noise fan, by far noisier than anything on my bench, the front panel is cramped (do I really need that many way to switch between single/auto/normal?) and the UI at some points were crude. My budget is flexible and my technical requirements are modest so this one is going back to Amazon and I will keep looking for a DSO I like.	-1
Be warned- this works with 1/4" plastic tube- not Brass- like the supply for my evaporative cooler- again, only with plastic	-1
That word heavy duty gets thrown around alot these days. It some how got thrown in this description either intentionally or unintentionally I'm not sure but that's not how I would describe these wheels. A fairer description would mention medium to light much more often. The rubber peeled off at the first corner. How fast was I going you ask? How fast do you think? These are nice wheels for 50-75 lbs.	-1
Esun recently posted material specs on intservo's site.  I've printed with their Blu black red and magenta.  Based on color the materials properties vary widely.  Solid red is a dark pink when printed.  It doesn't have the same material strength the other colors have.  When the first part broke I printed 3 times.  All three broke.  So I printed in the magenta instead and that didn't break and is still holding strong.  The makes me worries that whatever they use to make it opaque or use to make it red (without looking magenta) is to blame.  At this point I have had problems with 2 out of 4 colors.  I think esun needs to learn that the chemistry of the plastic isn't enough dyes can affect it too.  Except for the Black (which is perfect) and blue ( strong and really good color but nasty vapors) ill go back to colorfabb xt.	-1
iVE HAD SERIOUS ISSUES WITH THIS RED AND THE SOLID BLUE.  bOTH OF THEM ARE NOTHING LIKE THE OTHER PETG PRODUCTS IVE TRIED FROM ESUN... vERY WEAK AND BRITTLE ,AND ATTEMPTS TO GET A STABLE BUILD OUT OF THIS FILAMENT IS A WASTE OF MY LIFE.. iVE BEEN TRYING TO GET A GOOD PRINT OUT OF THESE 2 KGS FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND HAVE YET TO GET ONE GOOD PRINT OUT OF I IT AND HAVE ALMOST RUN THROUGH BOTH KGS. iVE NEVER HAD THIS MUCH TROUBLE WITH A FILAMENT AND HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS MUCH FRUSTRATION TRYING TO COMPLETE A SIMPLE PRINT... nOT EVEN WHEN I HAD NO IDEA WTF I WAS DOING DID I WANT TO BLOW UP MY PRINTER LIKE I DO WHEN THIS FILAMENT IS IN MY FILAMENT RACK, BUT I PAID MY HARD EARNED MONEY FOR IT SO I WILL KEEP TRYING TIL ITS GONE.  I DEFINATELY WILL NOT BE BUYING THE OPAQUE RED AND BLUE PETG ANYMORE...IT SUCKS SOMETHING FIERCE.  NOT TOO SURE I WILL TRY ANY OTHER OPAQUE CRAP AS THE TRANSPARENT ONES ARE THE STRONGER OUT OF THE COLORS ANYWAY AND I NEVER HAD MORE THAN A FEW BAD PRINTS WITH A TRANSPARENT PETG FILAMENT, AND THATS OUT OF A CLOSE TO A COUPLE HUNDRED OR SO COMPLETED PRINTS.   i CANT THINK OF ONE GOOD THING ABOUT THE RED AND BLUE. THE COLORS ARE WAY OFF FROM THE DESCRIPTION PICS AS WELL... RED IS MORE OF A DARK PINK OR LIGHT ORANGE THAN SOLID RED AND THE BLUE IS VERY DARK ALMOST NAVY IN COLOR...SOLID IN COLOR THOUGH.  WITH THIS FAILED PURCHASE AND ALL OF THE HEADACHES AND TROUBLES IVE HAD WITH THESE LAST 2 KGs OF "FILAMENT"...i AM SERIOUSLY CONCIDERING LOOKING FOR ANOTHER GO-TO BRAND OF FILAMENT. THIS MUCH HASSLE IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE	-1

These vary in size (loose tolerance) and some may not mate. The plastic is very hard and cracks when you crimp them. I removed the plastic once I found mating pairs then i shrink tubed them.	-1
Tape did not hold up as advertised and I used it on a Poly Tarp Garage with a metal frame.  I put over seams, etc., to provide extra support and the tape basically peeled off in less then 3 months in the AZ sun.  The Gorilla tape is far superior!  I will not order again.	-1

Albeit, this is a fairly new product that seems to be crowdfunded so I understand it is not a full blown production item...but, it was hyped a bit more than it currently delivers.  The concept is great and the screen works well showing the demo program installed on it, but using the editor is a very buggy experience.  It took a while to even find the editor and while browsing many forums looking for clues as to where it could be found, I ran across MANY complaints from people who purchased it and could not find the editor.  The link that is given gives an error and apparently Itead, the company who makes the screen, has put out at least 20 revisions to the editor in the last year, all with bugs and problems.  I finally found a version of the editor and it is constantly saying there are errors every time I try to add a button or item to a page on the screen.  It COULD be an extremely cool thing, but currently it is very hard to use and requires a lot of patchwork in the code.  It is pretty cool and with a lot of patience and hunting on the internet forums, it is possible to get the screen to do some things.  I got this to prototype a small automation project and getting the screen to work is becoming more work than the original project....	-1
Garbage complete garbage!! For $1000 dollars it doesn't clean dark carpets! Customer service says this is normal and just the way it is. BEWARE of the amazon vine customers. Its pretty much company's buying good reviews...	-1
These were fairly low quality connectors. Not quite what I was looking for.	-1
Terribly made. That is all there is to it.	-1
not worth using.  junk.  can I really trust this to carry power?  just does not seem strong or built to inspire confidence.  using my pressmaster crimper yields unsatisfactory crimps with these terms.  with brand name terms, it creates great crimps.  these terms are just not worth using and real ones are not that much more expensive.  don't waste your time with these.  if you are carrying power thru them (like, AC voltage) I would not trust them.	-1
Very Disappointed. Don't have a clear view.  Sent it back.	-1

The worst tape I have ever worked with. Once I peeled off the plastic the bottom of the tape stuck to everything.  As I tried to cut a piece, it absolutely destroyed my scissors, and after peeling back the coating, it all stuck together and is so thin and impossible to handle.  Not sure why it got such rave reviews.  One very disappointed customer!	-1
Tape is thin and has not the adhesive strength to hold a throw rug in place for more than one day. I would not recommend this product.	-1
Bed cracked after less than 2 months of use, trying to get a replacement bed is impossible, they say warranty doesn't cover so not only is the machine made with sub par materials the warranty is now sub par as well. This is sad, I really liked robo, guess they went in a new direction and are cheaping out everywhere.	-1
Seems like it should be a good unit but I think corners are cut on the $399 Amazon version. The z axis has 2 motors one is stronger than the other causing constant problems (wants to print crooked the higher you print. The 8x9x10 inch build volume is a lie - 9.5inches at best before skipping teeth (crashing) - z really didn't work on mine but once it is up to the top you have wires dragging- unprintable - basicly mechanicaly crashes before hitting the described dimensions (yes I zeroed the home position accurately and checked all the endstops - even had to fix one z stop that was knocked off in shipping. The heat on the plate is 8x8... Not a noob with 3D printing - corners cut on mechanics and the build volume 8x9x10 impossible on this machine.	-1
This thing is a mess.  See attached picture.  I have had it for 6 months now and I have tried to get it to work properly.  I have spent hundreds of hours attempting to get it to work reliably. It doesn't.  Both the X and Y axes skip.  See the attached picture.  To fix this I: 1) lubricated the shafts, 2) lubricated the bearings, 3) replaced the bearings, 4) replaced the bearings again, 5) realigned the Y axis shafts to achieve a very smooth operation, 6) tried multiple materials on the bed to get items to stick, and finally found BuildTak that works.  To no avail.  The print in the picture is my latest attempt.  My final solution to this problem is to buy a different printer from Amazon.  Hopefully, this next one will be higher quality.	-1
As the heading states I have had this printer for just over 6 months. I like to stay on the side of the positives but with the deep discounts on the R1 Plus and new Advanced I think people need to know what they are getting into. I teach Mechanical Design and Prototyping. We have a very expensive M1 Carbon all the way to consumer SLA, FFM Luzbots, Ultimakers, Prusa kits and complete one off RepRap builds.   What you save in initial costs you WILL spend on part upgrades to get satisfactory prints. If you don't wan't to read an in depth review this is my recommendation after thousands of prints for a budget printer that is reliable and WILL print well after calibration: A Genuine Prusa I3 Version 2 assembled printer. This will satisfy 95% of consumers needs and it is RELIABLE.   Back to the ROBO 3D R1 Plus. First unit, bad power supply. Second unit was shipped with nozzle against bed and bed was cracked. Third unit, z axis was several inches up on he left and full down on the right. After several hours of attempting to calibrate the unit I gave up as the Z rods were bent. Finally, unit four came packaged correctly and nothing was broken. Calibrated the unit and here is what we have found.  PROS:   -OK Hexagon hot end for PLA, PETG   -Direct drive extruder   -SD Card reader   -Open Source Machine   -Has 1 part cooling fan - more on that later but it's better than none   -Heated Bed   -Large build area  CONS:   -Auto leveling system is HORRIBLE! Using simple micro switches leads to too much variance. The center of the bed prints layers too close and the closer the head gets to the edge it begins to lift. This is due to the weight of the X axis being used to push against the glass causing it to bend slightly when not near a mount.   -On the same topic the bed insulator rubs on the Y axis bolt and needs to be taped tightly to the bed   -The ned is held on with magnets and during quick movements bed will hop. You can hear it and see it in the prints. You need to slow the jerk setting but as a consumer machine most people won't know how to do that.   -ABS printing is possible but very hit or miss. The bed heater is a poor quality unit that produces uneven heat and causes warping. Do not buy if you plan to print ABS.   -Z rods have a slight wobble when printing above 70% of the units max height due to the lack of upper z rod supports.   -There is no LCD display. With an SD card slot you still need a computer to print anything.   -Nozzles are ONLY available if you ask ROBO support! Aftermarket nozzles are too pointed and not meant for this machine   -Hot end fan is LOUD   -With only 1 fan on the rear certain PLA prints do not print correctly   -Printing over USB WILL cause problems. Despite using a dedicated 8 core Intel Designing desktop it still stuttered and froze at times. Same experiences when printing from a new MacBook Pro. Always save the gcode to the SD card and print from the card.  Parts that broke in 6 months:   -Extruder stepper motor   -1 hot end thermistor   -Front bed magnets moved and bed could not be leveled, had to replace the entire carriage   -Soldered connection on bed broke 2 times, bed had to be replaced   -Right side front Y slide bearing cap cracked   -Robo brand filaments print well but are highly overpriced  Parts that were printed, purchased or modified to make the machine print well consistently:   -LCD control board   -Z axis upper rod supports with bearings   -Spool Holder   -Complete new hot end mount with 2 fans and ducting   -E3D V6 Hot end - huge print quality improvement  The other main part of this printer is the software. It works OK but invest in Simplify3D and learn how to use it. Your prints will turn out much better especially if they require support.  In conclusion we put endless hours calibrating, replacing parts, upgrading and troubleshooting this 3D Printer. If I didn't have a class of students working on this machine I would not have had the time to get it going this well. It is now a decent machine after $400 in parts but unless you want to spend hours tinkering and yelling at this printer save yourself the headaches and look elsewhere. Now that the C2 has been released parts are already starting to disappear! If money is no object we have had good luck with the TAZ 6. If your on a budget a genuine Prusa Gen 2 runs for about the same cost as the Robo, requires nothing additional and prints almost as well as the TAZ 6.	-1
Even for the price this printer is terrible. I battled with this printer for months trying to get decent prints. Even with Simplify3D and a swapped E3D v6 hotend I couldn't get consistent print quality. There are so many better options out there in this price range	-1
I bought this two days ago on sale from amazon.  I haven't used a 3D printer before, but I am an engineer, own a CNC mill, and can design in Autodesk Inventor.  I'm not sure quite what I expected, but this has been an out-of-box failure for me.  The filament is incredibly difficult to load, and the automatic bed leveling seems completely defective.  I've followed all the instructions I could find to the letter (several of the websites that they refer you to are nonexistent), but I still can't figure out how to stop the head from crashing to the bed every single time I try to print something.  A footnote, there are supposed to be a bunch of free designs included, but the only thing I got was a calibration circle which crashed the printhead.  Would rate zero if I could.  :(	-1
I really wanted this to work out.  I actually do need the larger print size the Robo offers. There were good reviews, and several bad reviews.  I believed that Robo's customer service would help me out if there was an issue.  HOWEVER, the first printer we received would start to print, and around 10 minutes into the print it would just shut down.  A few minutes later, the software would notice the temperatures falling and report a failure.  Obviously the temperatures fell, the printer had shut itself down.  When I contacted Customer Service they seemed stuck on the idea that it was a clogged extruder, which it wasn't.  It took me 2 go-arounds with them to get them to realize that the temperature was not the issue, the temperature errors the software was reporting was an effect rather than a cause.  The printer had been extruding fine, then Bang, the thing shut down.  I thought the printer was defective, and since Tech Support was out at a convention, Level 2 was not really responding.  I initiated an Amazon exchange, sent the unit back, and Amazon sent me a new printer.  Then, the 2'nd printer did THE SAME THING!  Long story short, it looks like Robo had some units with marginal power supplies, and I managed to get two of them.  Tech Support offered to send me a power supply, it would take a week or so to ship to me, but I decided they had some Quality issues at the time and I didn't want to be stuck with a lemon, going back and forth with Robo's Tech Support.  I returned the 2'nd printer to Amazon and got another brand (which is working fine).  Unfortunately I will not have the print volume I had wanted.	-1
<div id="video-block-R22XMMWIZGTHD4" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91YtbzHUgsS.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61iHuKGVvdS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">Let me start by saying, I originally gave this printer 5/5 stars, I am here to amend that now that I have been using this printer for nearly a year now, and to throw extreme caution to anyone looking to buy one of these.  My first robo printer was a ROBO R1, which did not work properly. After 2 months it was having major electrical/software issues. With the help of the ROBO support team, I was able to make tweaks to the printers settings to get it to print, but eventually it had to be sent in. I sent it in after 4 months of ownership, and they sent me back a refurbished R1+. I paid $100 extra dollars to have them upgrade me to the R1+ system, so that I could take advantage of the lead screws. They sent the printer back about 1 month later, and after initial setup, it was working properly. Again, after 2 months I starting experiencing some major electrical and/or software issues, although, many of these issues were different from the ones I was experiencing before. One problem I was having was the z axis was not moving the correct distance. No thanks to their support staff, that pretty much had no idea how to get my printer going, I found out that my z steppers were bad. They were still spinning, however they would not travel the correct distance. After I replaced them my printers z axis returned to working order.  The BIGGEST problem with the ROBO The problem that has followed me to both of my printers is trying to get the printer to print on the bed correctly. I believe the issue derives from some of the poor engineering done on the machine. Rather than having to level the print bed the machine goes through a leveling process before each print. It does so by crashing the print head into the bed, which triggers 2 switches, telling the printer that it has reached the bed. The process measures from 9 points on the print bed to calculate it's exact levelness in all directions. The way its designed, forces the printer to use 2 switches, which never trigger exactly simultaneous to each other. It is my belief that this is confusing the printer causing it to not print on the bed correctly. Currently no matter how many tweaks I make, I cannot get the printer to print on the bed properly. Believe me, I have tried everything. Adjusting the z offset is not making a difference, and messing with how level the x carriage is doing nothing for me.  Low quality engineering As an engineer myself, I have got to say, this thing looks like it was designed be a college kid in his dorm room. Like I said before, I really don't like how the leveling system is incorporated, but there are many other design flaws. First of all, the vertical support rods. These rods are (sort of) supported at the top to keep them from shaking, but how they sit there is WAY to much play. So you have to print very slowly to get good prints, especially when you're printing tall objects. There is absolutely no reason these should have so much play, like I said, poor engineering. Next, is the heavy extruder. I have never been a fan of 3d printers that are not bowden fed, because it means the stepper motor for the extrude has to be ON the extrude assembly, making the extruder assembly much heavier, meaning you have to print slower to get good quality. I also never liked extruders with large feeding gears. Simply because there is no reason for them. Well the ROBO has both. Large feeding gears, and non bowden fed. The heated bed. First of all the heating element on the printers bed does not even cover the entire build space. The heating element is 8.4x8.4 inches. Worse yet, in the heating pad for the bed is quite literally taped into place. Thats right, no hardware holding it secure, just tape. So, you know, go ahead and let that soak in for a second. Tape............ This machine is partially taped together and shipped out as a finished product. Now I know what you are thinking. "Since the heat pad gets hot, how does the tape stay in place, won't the adhesive start to give and the tape start to peel away?" Yes, it does. SD card slot. Oddly enough, this is one thing I dislike most about this printer. The printer takes a micro SD card, which has to be inserted into the side of the printer. You insert the SD card upside down, but you have to get the card way back into the slot. Basically is just a huge pain in the ass to get an SD into and out of the printer.  My conclusion When it is printing, it needs to be going slow, but gives fantastic prints, however, its constant maintenance, has poor design, and mine currently won't even work. I would take your money elsewhere. The creator pro has come down in price a lot, get one of those, I have one, and its great.	-1
Wanted to much to like this because of the huge print area.  But after 2 weeks trying to get the calibration right and several posts on their help form I still haven't been able to get it to do a quality print.  The firmware was riddled with bugs and the calibration for it was more miss than hit.  If there was a little better out of box support for setup and had I been able to get even 1 decent print I'd say this is a 5 star based off price and size.  But at this point I couldn't recommend it	-1
We found out it jam our XYZprinting da Vinci 2.0 Duo 3D Printer, Blue. Glad we did not get a bigger roll. Not sure what we are going to do with this Filament now. If anyone find out a way we can us it in this printer please let us know.	-1
This is beyond a doubt THE MOST frustrating filament i have ever worked with. I have tried this in both my Direct Drive and Bowden printers. it jams, it has layer adhesion issues, is basically too soft! I'm sure people have gotten this to work fine for them, but on my Ultimaker 2+ Extended and my Robo 3D R1+ its just a nightmare.	-1
I'm unhappy with both the product and the seller. Don't let the "Low VOC" tag fool you. The product is extremely toxic. The vapors can be fatal. It causes cancer, genetic defects, and irreversible neurological damage. It can't be thrown in the trash because it's extremely toxic to aquatic life, and doesn't break down. It's for professional use only. The seller includes two hypodermic needles. Given the toxic nature of this product, I think the hypodermic needles are a very bad idea. Shipping was not particularly fast, and the can arrived dented.	-1
they are missing a lot in quality. I am not happy with the selection either as you get a lot of small anchors and the few big ones they need more bite	-1
i just rated another bunch of anchors and these will work, but i will not use any more. Just very poor quality	-1
Had issues with it not holding parts while printing.	-1
This worked pretty well on some cheap pane glass I got out of a picture frame at the dollar store, however when I tried to used it on higher quality borosilicate glass, the results were not good. When trying to apply, it just beads up like water on the borosilicate glass so it is impossible to lay down an even coat of it. I tried several times to get this to work but the parts would warp and lift off the bed when using borosilicate glass. Quite a disappointment.	-1
The heads snap off pretty easily	-1
Not cost effective. recommend buying swordfish 30090 kit..	-1
These M4 head cap screws are rather fragile. They work for applications where only very little torque is applied to the screw head. I also noticed that surface layer material easily flakes off from some screw heads. Very cheaply manufactured indeed and not recommended for performance applications.	-1
There are 2 boxes. One has M3 screws and nuts. The other box has M2 screws and nuts. In each of the boxes there are 150 screws, but only 30 nuts. Otherwise, there is a good assortment of screws. But I had expected an enough nuts for all of the screws.	-1
After looking through the reviews I decided on this digital caliper. The movement of this caliper is very stiff from 0 to about 25mm.  After that it moves more easily.  So for measuring something small, where one needs the most precision, the unit feels clunky. The thumbwheel is sloppy; no feeling of precision at all. I do like the digital display, but that just makes it all show and no go. Based on other reviews I either received a very defective unit or other reviewers had low expectations.  I have no idea which it is. In either case this unit doesn't meet my needs. I've decided to return it.  It's not going to loosen up by using it and I'm not getting my money's worth out of it.	-1
Wrong size hardware, ended up just ordering a whole new extruder.	-1
I bought this material to try. I've had good luck with most Hatchbox products, but not with this stuff. It seemed to extrude ok, and it stuck to the build plate, but after trying a handful of test prints I couldn't get the infill to come out good. After multiple bad prints I am going to stick with the PLA.	-1
This stuff is crap. I cannot get consistent prints. It has bubbles and is not consistent in thickness. When I get a good print its awesome but thats only like 1 out of 20 prints.	-1
This is by far the worse petg filament I have bought from hatchbox, their abs is perfect, and inland's petg is perfect as well. But this has a lot of moisture in it, and the actual filament line is kinked in spots.	-1
of the three most popular filament brands sold on amazon, solutech, matchbox, and e-sun, this one was in last place from my testings of it. as i saw that many high reviews between these 3 brands i didn't know which to buy so i bought 1 in each. first off i like to say that i might be a little bias to petg, everyone seem to think it is much stronger than pla, i don't feel that to be the case, but it is more flexible which is why it can i think be view as a stronger material. it downsize being more subseptable to stringing, can't paint it, and almost all glue will not work on it. if you want to know what this material is like pick up a bottle of water from your store and that is basically it. anyway on with it for my usage of petg, i find hatchbox to be the highest running temp, 240-250c, which would result as more stringiness than the other two especially in complicated build. for petg i found that esun perform better even at 220c and excellent strenght up to 235c. but the shocking result was solutech, mainly because it was not as good as esun but perform better than hatchbox. it ran at lower temp as esun with similar strength, but cost only 17.99 vs hatchbox 29.99 and esun 24.99. downside is amazon doesnt carry many solutech in petg so color is limited. so if you looking at petg for the first time like i was and don't want to buy all three to test, try solutech, or esun, and then try  this you be surprise how the cost doesnt equal quality in this case, or maybe solutech is just coming on strong so they lower their cost to capture an audience, who knows but its made in USA too. also i heard different printer works differently on types/brands of filament, so for this i only had three printers that i tested on Prusa MK2s, Monoprice maker select plus and mini.	-1
I was expecting more from Hatchbox. I love their PLA and ABS, but having this as the first experience with PETG it was not what I was expecting. I have used eSun PETG in the past and it was always a solid filament. Using this with the exact settings and it jams within 10 minutes in. I had to heavily modify the settings and even then it still jams very bad. I still love Hatchbox for their top quality PLA but this is just not good.	-1
I'm commenting only on the PETG Silver. I say this because I'm sure that Hatchbox has good PETG, just not this color. I've printed a ton of eSUN's PETG in every color they have (they don't have silver) at 245/80 on glass and never miss a beat. This stuff runs badly at Hatchbox's recommended temperature (240 - 260( and well below it. I tried printing this all the way down to 205. At that point it finally stops running but no longer adheres to itself very well (heck, the extruder doesn't even start clicking until 193). I also tried printing on glass, painter's tape, Elmer's purple glue stick on glass, and Elmer's purple glue stick on painter's tape everywhere from no heat to 100. It simply would not stick worth beans. Seriously, I think they need a little more R&D on this particular filament...	-1

I got the filament on June9/10 and opened the vacuum sealed packaging and checked the O.D. and hooked it up to my printer. I've had other filaments with moisture issues and those could be dried but this is the worst moisture I've even seen in a filament, so bad I thought there was an issue with the nozzle but after changing setups the results remained the same.  I plan to try again with this filament but will wait for Amazon to restock again.	-1
I had all kinds of problems trying to print with this PETG. I thought it was just me for awhile, but after a little bit of testing and changing to a different brand of filament, I realize it wasn't me.  For whatever reason it seems to be brittle and breaks easily with poor layer adhesion. I'm going to try a different color of Hatchbox PETG, however for now the silver is just unusable for me. I would have returned it, but I used so much of it just trying to get a good print that I'm about halfway through the roll.	-1
I purchased this real and in a few days it arrives. Always has good shipping and typically the filament is good quality. But this time I am extremely disappointed. I opened the box and noticed the vacuum bag that seals the filament had a small tear in it. So it was no longer isolated from the humidity. I didn't think much of it at the time but when I started my first print I knew then that this filament was garbage. It was so waterlogged I could get a single print to not fail. The surfaces of the print looked almost furry because of all the steam pockets bursting. And you could hear the hotend spitting and farming steam the entire print. So I put the spool in the oven for a couple hours and that seemed to help a very little bit. Unfortunately this roll is to far. Saturated and is now going in the garbage. Extreamly disappointed with hatchbox. First time this has happened to me from them.	-1
I have run almost half of this roll and am getting constant clogs and ruined prints.  Not sure why because all the other rolls of PET and ABS from Hatchbox have been awesome.  I have tried just about everything to get it to run reliably to no avail.  May just be a bad roll, not sure.	-1
More parts for the money pit. I bake quite a bit and replace gears quite a bit also.	-1
Buy a Kitchenaid mixer and you'll get really good at replacing this part.  Did everything the manual said and the gearbox still tore itself apart.  Since Whirlpool bought Kitchenaid, these things have become junk.  Buy a Bosch mixer.  We did and have never been happier with a kitchen mixer.	-1
They work, but there's no/little solder on the connection so you need to rip it apart and resolder it. Only three out of five worked at all, even after resoldering. Would not reccoemend. Also, the ones that did work did not last long.	-1
Not working on Mac longer than 5 secons with PhotoBooth.	-1
Low video resolution and marginal focus. Totally inadequate instructions. Software doesn't run well on my pc, with Win 7 64 bit. Have to power down the pc to close the app.	-1
This is a very poor product. It is not as thick as the advertised spec states. This aluminum DIN Rail is advertised to be 0.8mm thick, but it is only 0.64mm thick. That doesn't sound like a big difference, but it does made a big difference. Standard steel DIN Rail is approximately 1.2mm thick.  Being made of aluminum and extremely thin, compared to standard DIN Rail, this product is very easily bent and distorted, when trying to install components to the DIN Rail. Also, the slots for mounting the DIN Rail are only 4mm wide and 12mm long, compared to 6mm wide and 18mm long for standard steel DIN Rail. Mounting the DIN Rail with 4mm screws instead of 6mm screws also makes a difference is strength and durability of your build.	-1
To begin with, the pieces are randomly cut, and not at neat, 90 degree angles. Some of the cuts go through the mounting holes, some do not. No two pieces are alike. The aluminum is much thinner than other brands I have used, and it lacks the stiffening bends seen in other rails. It seems too flimsy to mount breakers or anything else that might take the slightest strain.	-1
Maybe there a slightly different sizes of this stuff but this was too small for my relay mounts. I ended up beating it up with a hammer to get the relay mounts to hold.	-1
D.O.A.:(	-1
I'm a little hesitant to post this review, but this is the first roll of Hatchbox filament I have not been 100% satisfied with.  I would have just gone with a return, but I didn't unseal it for about four months after I bought it, and by then it was too late to return.  The roll I got is clearly stickered with a normal Hatchbox sticker.  But it prints at a weirdly high temperature for PLA (closer to 250C where I usually print ABS), it smells like ABS, it has a weird color, and it clogs up my extruder when I try to print with it.  I have a suspicion that the roll I got is some kind of weird ABS blend, like maybe they accidentally threw in some ABS pellets into a PLA roll extrusion or something.  Anyway, like I said, this is the only roll of Hatchbox filament I haven't liked, and I've bought a lot of Hatchbox filament, so I feel kind of bad posting this, but this roll is pretty well useless.	-1
Under extruded big time and I expected far better but nope! Ill,be hitting up my regular awesome zyltech  for perfectiom.	-1
THIS FILIMENT IS HORRIBLE, THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD AND I HAVE USED OVER 360 ROLLS OF 1.75 FILIMENT MOSTLY 3D SOLUTECH VERY FEW PROBLEM, A BAD REEL ONCE IN A WHILE. YOU JUST CALL 3D SOLUTECH AND TELL THEM AND THEY SEND YOU A NEW REEL, HATCHBOX WANTS A PICTURE OF YOUR PROJECT, REEL OF FILIMENT, PURCHASE INVOICE, SLICER SCREEN SHOT, SLICER SETTINGS, TYPE AND MODEL NUMBER OF PRINTER. SO MUCH FOR THEIR 30 DAY WARRANTY, THEY KNOW NO ONE IS GOING THRU ALL THE TIME AND TROUBLE TO TAKE PHOTOS OF ALL THOSE ITEMS. JUST STAY AWAY FROM HATCHBOX. I ALSO HAVE CONTACTED AMAZON ABOUT THIS.	-1
Any idea why this won't adhere to Kapton? I've run numerous other brands and they all adhere fine.  This will not adhere at all.	-1
First spool was a tangled mess.  I was issued a return spool. It is also a tangled mess. Unfortunate because it's a great color just not up to par andtomany failed prints	-1
When it didn't fail it was great, but this filament failed 90% of the time. I thought it was my printer, but I discovered that there were actual folds, nodes and bumps in the filament that caused it to jam in the feeder. What happened to QC? Would like a replacement or refund. Most of the spool has been used on failed prints, so I cannot return it.	-1
I had to return this. i spent so many hours printing so many calibration cubes TRYING to get the printer dialed in, and the prints were just not coming along. The worst part about it was the filament would not adhere to itself during printing. I'd end up with a print I could tap and it'd fall apart into a big string with lots of right angles in there.  I do love the translucent red, but this metallic stuff is craptastic. Maybe I got a bad roll, I dunno. Either way, it's heading back.	-1
The first few passes of this material are gummy, almost like it's not ABS, but could just be the colorant or other additive in this reel that affects the properties.  I have no issue with their black but green and silver have been an issue so far, need to try some other of my colors as I am worried that hatchbox isn't very consistent reel to reel.	-1
i owned this for just about 2 months, when it worked it printed quite nicely! however that was far less than half the time i owned it. i have since returned it. at first it worked great for 2 days, then on day 3 it wouldn't turn on. support suggested dead power on/off switch so i routed power around it. sure enough dead switch, back on and printing for a few days.  then it wouldn't read bed temperature, it turns out a moving bed brings some issues! the wires connected to the bed are under a lot of stress, and the white molex style plug probably isn't the best solution, the connection failed. cut all the wires short and one at a time crimped on plugs and jammed it back together, it works again.  then a few days later the extruder motor wouldn't spin. after lots of diagnosis i determined the stepper motor was fine, the wires running to it were fine, it was the driver on the main board. this apparently happens so often (see the facebook hictop group) that hictop has firmware special just for this situation, you flash the mainboard and connect the extruder to e1 instead of e0. tried this but no luck, so hictop mailed me a replacement mainboard. new board arrived, flashed firmware, right back to printing.  then a few days later i couldn't level the bed! tried and tried and tried, whats this the carriage is warped! after looking online its yet another common issue, i took the carriage out and looked at it, sure enough its not flat, which comes as no surprise it's paper thin sheet metal. so i buy an "upgrade" Y carriage on amazon, modify it to fit the hictop printer and i'm back up and running.  then a few days later the extruder motor won't spin again! this sounds familiar... since i already have all the diagnostic tech support steps i go through them all, i test the motor, the wire, i verify the mainboard driver is the issue once again. then i try the e1 firmware, it doesn't work again. i email all of this information to tech support and they ignore it, they cut and paste the same responses as the first time. they drag their feet for a week and finally agree to send me another main board. it arrived, i flashed the firmware and installed it same as last time excited to get back to printing. only this time it doesn't work, SAME PROBLEM! e0 is dead, and the e1 firmware didn't help. this time tech support sends me a youtube video to calibrate the voltages to each stepper, which i carefully did and once again tried both e0 and e1 firmware, nothing.  i contact their support again and report back and they don't believe me. they want me to send the parts back to verify that they're sending me broken parts... so i sent it back.  then i get another main board in the mail, just as excited!! i flash the firmware, installed it, hooked everything up, and you guessed it, DEAD AGAIN, SAME PROBLEM!  with that i pinched it off, i sent this story to amazon customer service and they stepped up and did the right thing. thank you Amazon for allowing me to return this JUNK and get a refund. if you're looking around at your first 3d printer KEEP LOOKING elsewhere, hictop sells junk thats JUST barely enough to print, but parts will fail one after another and then you need to start "upgrading." i put upgrade in quotes because it's not an upgrade if it's required just to operate correctly.	-1
was missing pieces and has no ground cable not good design.  returned this for a different product	-1
The vise shattered on its first serious use. Clamping the barrel of a Mini-14 rifle to secure a loose flash suppressor and POW! the piece shown in blue, below the rifle barrel in the photo, broke off. This caused the vise to flop around unsecured on it's base, making it difficult to complete my task.	-1
One side arrived warped and when placed in vice it did not stick. When I tightened vice in an attempt to straighten the magnets fell out from both sides. Set pieces aside will attempt to glue magnets back on as material seems to be pretty good. Dissappointed	-1
I'm giving it a one star because I bought five of these and put one in each door of my tool chest downstairs. The relative humidity is 46%, but ever canister went from red to white in less than one week. I don't live in Florida for crying out loud, I live in Minnesota with a walk out basement. 46% relative humidity isn't bad. My tools (which have been in my basement workshop for 30 years, have never rusted, so these desiccants are useless for me. Yes I know I can put then in the range and reuse them, but every week? No thanks.  Update: I got a small dehumidifier (here on Amazon) and that does the trick.	-1
