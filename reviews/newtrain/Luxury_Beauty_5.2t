I love it. It does wonders for my hair. It's really improved over the years. Does not come off on your hands or pillow cases. Makes your hair look fuller.	1
Works great with my naturally reddish-brown hair.	1
Excellent product for thin hair, I have been using it for several years and never want to be without it.	1
These just really didn't work for me. I have diffuse thinning--not the worst out there, but quite noticeable. Sprinkling the fibers just caused them to kind of bunch up and clump, so it was really obvious there was something unsavory going on on my scalp. If you sweat a little bit or scratch your head, the fibers will really turn into clumps. I'm glad this works for other people, but I don't really want anyone to be able to tell that I'm hiding my thin hair behind some powder.	-1
It's Okay.	1
I took the advice of another reviewer and bought small container.  First time used I was very surprise of how easy and well it covered bald spot in back of head.  Stayed on for 2-3 days and not messy.  Wish I had found sooner instead of wasting a lot of time trying to cover up back, bald line.  UPDATE:  FORGET THE SPRAY.  It is hard to use, sprayer sticks and substance not good.  Plain air spray just as good, if not better	1
I have some scaring on the top of my head due to skin lupus. This has solved my problem. It is easy to apply and no mess. Took it with me today when I got my hair trimmed and my stylist was very impressed. I would highly recommend.	1
OK Product	1
Love it this really works!	1
easy to apply, did not need all of the other tools that i purchased with it.	1
I've recently discovered that my thick hair was starting to fall out around the bangs area.  Through the tears I decided to try different products to see which was the best for me.  I tried tinted dry shampoo, root touch up spray and Toppik.  The root touch up spray was just ok, I felt that I had to spray paint on my head.  It does cover grays roots very well!  Tinted dry shampoo was better and passable,  I did't like the feel of it though plus you have to brush a lot of the dust out. Toppik was my favorite of the 3 by far.  It covered well and blended in nicely with my hair color.  This is what I'll be using!	1
Great.  They all are.	1
This stuff is AMAZING. I have thinning spots and this covers and binds to the hair. I used to always have to wear my hair up to cover it but i can wear my hair down now and not have to worry about my patches showing. It stays in place and doesn't wear off throughout the day. No more worries. I've been contemplating buying this stuff for awhile after reading someone's blog about thinning hair. I buy the smallest size of these, use it everyday (a little goes a long way) and it lasts me a month. I just reorder when I get low. So buy size accordingly to how much you need.  Get it you won't be disappointed. Get your confidence back!	1

This might work well for others, but this brand made my scalp incredibly irritated.  Also, the color has a greenish tinge, which was NOT the look I was going for.  Nanogen and Cobuki have worked better for me.	-1
This worked for me! A little goes a long way too!  My bangs are thinning, so I use it right in front.  I would recommend it	1
Love this production, but sometimes it comes out a bit, even with the Fiberhold Spray. Definitely would recommend it for anyone with thin/thinning hair.	1
I like it work great on hair  make it look fuller great	1
I did not see "fibers".  This is more like a colored, powdered hair "shampoo" that DOES add body, and does NOT leave white residue like a dry shampoo.  That said, I like this product.  I have fine, thin curly hair that will droop if I use heavy products.  I have tried a lot of body-building hair products, and many are just too weighty  Even Frizz-eeze is not great for me. So far, this is a winner..	1
Good	1
I got this in light brown.  I have slight hair loss from a medication I was taking, at my crown.  This looks like dirt, & sucks the shine from my hair wherever it falls.  The color is not even remotely brown or light brown.  More grayish black brown. I gave it 2 stars because I like the shake it on container.	-1
I like it but very expensive and other comparable products available.	1
I have used this product a couple of years. they  just bumped the price from $46.00 to $57.00 Increase  23% that bothers me. They use our positive comments and feedback . I know exactly what they are doing.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/TOPPIK-Hair-Building-Fibers-Black-0-97-oz/dp/B0002ZW5UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">TOPPIK Hair Building Fibers, Black, 0.97 oz.</a>	1
Works great.  Spend 2 - 3 extra minutes in morning getting ready for work and bye bye bald spot.  Love it!!!	1
Really pleased with TOPPIK hair building fibers.. I would prefer to have a thick head of hair but since that is not the case I am very thankful for this product. It gives me the confidence to go out and feel comfortable without worrying that people are staring at my thinning hair.	1
Good head camo.	1
Great product!	1
I since died my hair and it works well with dark brunettes for medium brunettes. This also worked well in my fianc hair which he is Asian with black hair so color is definitely darker than expected ( got medium brown ). It came on easy like pepper shaker and apply straight on problem area it sticks and stays until you shower or sweat . Covered his thinning hair very well ! If you touch it with a brush it will move it does not stick so style hair then put it on as final touches . Hope this helps  update I bought a second one ! i love the mini because you can fit it in a clutch and don't have to worry about reapplying when you're out and about ! perfect for those wanting to make their hair look a little more full !	1
After I had my baby, I lost a lot of hair (thanks, hormones) and had a few sparse spots that made me feel very self conscious. My hair dresser recommended this and I love it. It's slightly darker than my natural hair color, but it really doesn't seem to make a difference. A little goes a long way and makes the spartan parts of my hair look fuller and thicker. My hair has since grown back, but I have fine hair so I still use it in places. Love it!	1
Husband loves it!	1
Don't leave home without it!	1
This product has changed my life... I feel so much confidence since I've had it. I was tired of people looking at the back of my balding head and the top. This adds hair fibers to existing hair. It covers everything on.my balding head. Sometimes it takes some time in the morning to do just like you have regular hair. You have to get a hang of the pepper shaker style. I have tried the other tools they offer, but as a primery bald person that just seems to not work as well. The pump just blows powder all over. Most people don't even notice there's a difference, and they think I just dyed my hair. I sleep with it at night and leave it on for almost about a week (5 days) then it starts to get a little itchy. Has to be touched up everyday. I.spray w hair spray n blow it w blower to hold. I have read that you can get it wet and when I go in the shower it doesn't seem to come out right away... but I haven't quite tested that theory out yet. Also cut it when trimming up like real hair. It's Worth the try for any guy n gal, n would be excellent for guys w fullet hair but thinning.	1
This stuff is great. I have a frontal incline of my hairline and this product helps cover it up perfectly. Can't tell at all i have this in my hair and thats the way i like it. Highly recommend	1
Quick fix for an uneven and terrible haircut! I received a very bad student haircut that went from medium full to shorter than military with exposed scalp. I stumbled across this stuff on Amazon and bought a competitors as well. This one worked well but was actually enhanced by the other one. This was mostly because the other was a shade different in color and combined created a more natural result. My hair was shorter in one side than the other and the student actually took a 'chunk' out. I looked terrible! This stuff actually created the illusion. Of an even look and concealed my visible scalp while my hair is growing back. It is worth a try! Hair spray makes it stick and once dry will not transfer. Step 1. Shake over your washed, dried, and styled, hair like you are sifting in a back and forth motion. Step 2. Pat gently but firmly into place. Step 3. Wipe any product off your forehead, ears, neck and be prepared to do it again. Step 4. Seal it with a mist of quality hair spray ( you do not need theirs!!). Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine worked great!  Allow to dry or hit it with the hair dryer! Once dry feel free to shake your head over the sink to prove nothing is coming lose!  You're now good to go! Yes, your hair will feel a little more crunchy than normal,but for me I didn't care. This saved me from a lot of embarrassment and I recommend it to at least try. I don't think it will cover a bald head unless you want to look like you glued hair sprinkles on, But if you still have hair, give it a go! Buy two shades and use them together!	1
It's like sprinkling salt or pepper on your head and expecting it to look like hair...Don't bother purchasing.	-1
Great product! I have extensive hair loss issues and this product has enabled me to go out with confidence.	1
Great product. Bought it for my brother and the results were unreal and so natnral looking. I applied it for him. Might be better if you have someone apply it for you so the other person can see any bare spots.	1
It always works for me	1
This is the top of the lie in hair fibers.  I have to stay on a budget and use 2nd and 3rd best at times due to price.	1
I really love this stuff. It stays put with hairspray. I have been using it for a while and will keep on buying it. But I noticed if I have lots of hair products on the scalp, it doesn't "stick" as well. So, be careful not to put too much product close to the scalp.	1
My hair is catastrophically thin due to treatments of two cancers. Toppik does a terrific job at hiding the "holes" where my hair used to be. I no longer feel insecure about it. It is a terrific product.	1
I use this regularly to hide the thinning hair at my part.  My scalp is ghostly white, and this somehow bonds to the hair (not the scalp) and fill in the part.  I finish it with regular hairspray.  I am a femal and have been using this product for years, and through many haircolor changes,  I've also used the auburn and light brown.  This is better than the cheaper products.	1
Excellent product, it takes just a small amount to cover my thinning area	1
Great product that lives up to its hype.  The small ones help you find your color.  (then can order a larger one). It has a sprinkle method that I've used on both dry and wet hair.  I am a medium blonde with some brown tones.  The light brown was a good match.  It helps conceal a larger part or thinning areas of the hair.  The small ones are great for travel too.	1
This really does disguise thinning hair.  I am a female with thin hair due to medication.  this keeps my part from looking too wide.  Looks normal/natural.	1
the container is too small ,,, it is much smaller then the applicator, so i cannot use it at all	-1
It fills in nicely	1
Use this stuff regularly. Covers temporary hair loss from a medical condition.	1
great product	1
Works great...people actually think I have hair on my crown.  I'm extremely happy with the product.	1
I love this stuff... Perfect for my thinning hair and when I'm in between coloring...	1
It does what it claims!!	1
wish it was cheaper. Works real well. Save yourself time and money and buy this one. I tried using all the ones they sell on amazon and ended up returning them.	1
I was so happy to find the toppix fibers in a light brown and a nice sized container.	1
Covers up those shiny spots.	1
I want to give an honest assessment because I know how hair loss affects each of us. I've been losing my hair since I was 20 and have done everything under the sun to fight it off. I've reached a point in my life, after some surgeries, where I've got about 30-40 percent density over the entire top of my head and a little less in the back. I have run out of donor hair and was stuck with either having to wear a hair system or use a masking product. When I first started using this I was prepared to give it a lower rating. It didn't seem to apply evenly and ran very easily with a little sweat or water. After applying it a dozen times it got easier and was more effective so don't necessarily give up after the first couple of tries.  First of all, Toppik won't cover a completely bald head. You have to have some hair already for it to look even slightly natural. I hold the bottle about 2 inches off my head and tap the side of the bottle and move it around to try and apply it evenly. You should use bright lighting when you apply it and use a hand mirror so you can check the top of your head a few times as you're applying it. It makes your hair look very powdery at first so I lightly rub the top of my hair to get some of it to fall down into the scalp. Then, and this is very important, you have to use a good shiny hair spray. I put 2-3 applications on to counteract the dull look from the Toppik powder. The more hair you already have the easier this process is, and the more natural it will look. Don't go swimming with it or stand out in a heavy rain shower for very long, or it will clump and/or run at some point as the hair spray wears off. I would encourage you to do at least 3-4 trial runs before going into public, and order a couple different colors to try. Also, I sometimes use DermMatch (scalp concealer) as a first step to apply a base coat since it is even more water proof and is less expensive. Then the Toppik on top of it provides more texture. I use a lot of Toppik on each application. A medium size bottle of it lasts me about 5-6 weeks applying it almost every day.	1
Great product!!! Covers thinning area very well!	1
awesome a must for thinning hair, just sprinkle on the area and take fingers and jiggle hair a little and style as usual...it is AMAZING...THIS is a very light blond...they also make a med blond that is great on light blond hair that may cover better...don't use too much bec it can make scalp itchy but you really don't need a lot...	1
Does the trick	1
These fibers are a good product for making a thinning head of hair look thick again. I do however recommend the TOPPIK hair fattener spray over this product. Also, if you are insistent on purchasing this item, I highly recommend purchasing the pump applicator as well. It makes for the application process so much more effective and will extend the duration of the products use.	1
Works surprisingly well	1
it covers gray hair perfectly	1
works amazing, just very black!	1
Product was as expected :-)	1
very good product... I lost a lot of my hair and it covers that very well..	1
Great product!	1
So glad I found this. Now that I have gone gray I don't have to worry about my pink scalp showing. After styling my hair, I shake it lightly on exposed scalp areas and it stays there until I wash it out. Easy to use and I've been using the same small bottle since July. Bought a second for my travel bag. Totally recommend this product.	1
Used this in between coloring.  Now am letting my hair go gray and it is really helping me tolerate the grow out.	1
Slightly purple/off color in some lighting. Sticks better than Caboki but the color made me stop buying it.	1
Love it!	1
love this!! I have white gray hair, but with a pink scalp, this makes the pink less visible.  It stays on till you wash it off. its like powdered hair....really small though.	1
Color great, too pricey	1
OK THE REASON I AM GIVING TOPPIK ONE STAR IS BECAUSE I BEEN BUYINGTHIS PRODUCT ALL THE TIME AND I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT. IT USE TO BE ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET. NOW, THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT IN THE MARKET. LATELY AFTER U PUT THE MEDIUM BROWN IN UR HAIR AND THEN U PUT THE SPRAY ON TOP OF IT, YOUR HAIR BECOMES PURPLE ON THE AREA WHERE UR HAIR IS THINNING BUT THE REST STAYS BROWN AND IT LOOKS GROSS AND DISGUSTING. I CALLED THE MANUFACTURE AND I SPOKE WITH THE MANAGER AND I SENT THEM PICTURES, THEY RESPONDED SAYING THAT THE BOTTLE THAT I BOUGHT MUST BE DMAGED AND THEY SENT ME A NEW ONE. I GAVE THEM A CHANCE AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND OH LORD IT WAS JUST HORRIBLE!!!!!! I WENT AND I BOUGHT NEW BOTTLE FROM SALLY BEAUTY AND IT WAS THE SAME THING. THATS ITTTTTTTTTT. I AM NOT BUYING THIS RODUCT EVER AGAIN	-1
I used to think buying a wig was my only alternative as a female with alopecia. I started with one little thin spot 20 years ago. Now the entire top of my head is extremely sparse or bald. Nothing worked for me before this. My only problem was that the dark brown was too dark, and the med brown too light. I found out you could pry/twist off the top of the regular size container or larger, and then you could mix colors to get the exact right match. I attach the sprayer, cover my head in a fine mist, pat, comb. I continue to apply where needed and then spray with the fiber fix (or hairspray, if in a pinch, works fine). My hair is shiny and I am ready to face the world without being embarrassed about my mostly bald head. I now look like I have hair where there is none, or very little. This really made a difference in how I feel about myself. I no longer have to be embarrassed or cry about how little hair I have. Check this out... It really works!	1
Good	1
Makes the spot you are covering look dry and dull.  Not a natural look. I will not buy this again.	-1
it made my father's hair look great, too bad it can't stay there forever.	1
I have fine thinning hair.  I used two other products before trying Toppik Hair Building Fibers. I used a color spray aerosol and a brush on powder.  I didn't care for the aerosol spray because you had to be so careful not to get overspray on your clothes.  The brush on powder does work for small areas, but my hair continued to thin and it was time consuming to cover the top of my scalp.  This powder was suggested by a sales clerk at a beauty supply store.  It seemed to work better and was easier to use.  If I had a choice, I would like not to use any product, but I don't want my scalp showing so I am very happy to have a product like this.   I started purchasing from Amazon and found the product more reasonably priced.  Amazon also has a pump that screws onto the Toppik bottle and you can direct the powder better to the areas where you need it most.  I use a little hair spray to help hold it in place.  I found the medium brown covers my scalp better than the light brown and blends better with my hair color and highlights.  I would be lost without this product.  One negative I don't think can be avoided, is the powder can make your hair look a little dull at the roots, but the alternative would be the appearance of  thinning hair.  I order the refills and re-use my container.	1
makes my hair look full	1
Find your color and try it. I don't leave the house without it. It's really quite remarkable!	1
Fantastic cover for thin hair!	1
Amazing product for thin hair.  Use it with covure and they work great  together.	1
Great product.  Just spray on - I suggest the optional sprayer attachment and use hair spray to keep the toppix in.  Makes a huge difference in making sparse spots look full.  I am very sensitive to many products, and I have no sensitivity to this.- no problems.  Highly recommend this low tech solution	1
Love this stuff.  I was recently diagnosed with Telogen Effluvium which causes massive hair shedding.  This stuff is a miracle.  I am able to cover up the sparse areas and the wider than usual part flawlessly.  I will definitely be repurchasing.	1
LOVE this stuff.  Hides where hair is thinning and gives more body.	1
I only buy this on Amazon. Great price!	1
I only buy this on Amazon. Greta price!	1

What would I do without Toppik Hair Building Fibers?  They save my vanity every time.	1
Great product, great price, fast shipping!	1
Fills in those thin spots nicely..Great for men or women.	1
I gave it a 4 star because it seems to have a slightly different formula compared to prior, meaning, it seems a little more sticky.	1
great for bald spots for women I use it everyday no one knows.	1
Amazing!	1
Very Nice, that I ordered it again for my wife's thinning hair..	1
My wife loved it for the thick effect it had on her thinning hair, and I just ordered another bigger size for her!!	1
Saw on Dr. Oz so ordered it. Very disappointed though. Did not fill in at all. Made no difference. Would return if it wasn't such a hassle.	-1
It works well for the most part.  A little powdery looking at times.	1
Nice product. Clings to your hair and scalp effectively even without any hair spray.	1
Looks just like real hair! Okay, so let me start by saying that I had alopecia (not sure on the spelling) when I was in college. The hair on the sides of my head, right above my ears just thinned out and has never grown back. I always wear my hair down because it's easy to cover the spots with my curly hair. However, if I ever want to wear my hair up, I'm faced with exposing my 2-Half-Dollar-sized bald spots. I've colored in the spots before, but I go through those eye pencils way too quickly and they aren't exactly real looking. These Fibers are the first thing that has really allowed me to wear my hair up and look normal. Don't get me wrong, I'm still keeping an eye out for a hair growth miracle, but in the mean time, this will do. ;)  PS: Several people have actually mistaken this product for successful regrowth on my head.	1
Spray applicator only fits on Regular size and Economy size. It will not fit the 1.94 oz. bottle size. Excellent product that works so much better with the spray applicator.	1
One of my Favorite products!!	1
Have been using Toppik--a very good product for sure--during several years now, but amazon offers other hair fibers at a much better price. Spencer Forrest had best begin competing with its prices!	1
Been using this product for years to improve thinning hair	1
I lost some hair when I was diagnosed with a medical issue and was left with a few small balding patches. As a female this was extremely embarrassing. I am so glad I found this product! I have told friends I use it and they have stared at my head and can't tell where the powder is versus my actual hair. It has made me much more confident! Occasionally when I scratch my head some of it comes off onto my hand but this is a minor annoyance compared to how great it makes me look.	1
Contents should be filled closer to the top of the bottle; otherwise, product was fine.  Delivery was also good.	1
Excellent loved	1
Love this stuff!	1
IT WORKS GREAT! I LOVE IT! I just wish it wouldn't wash out!	1
what options do we have when going bald? this a good product it does not attaches to the hair as they promise but it really helps to cover bald spots	1
Love this product	1
Great!	1
I use this every day, but I also shower at night and "no-poo" my baby fine hair every few days. If you do not, then the fibers might get on your pillowcase.  With a new bottle, I peel off the plastic tape that is covering the shaker, then tape off 1/2 of the opening with blue painter's tape - otherwise too much will come out too fast.  You do not actually shake this on to your hair, but instead into your  part lines. Part your hair, hold the bottle at 45 degrees or so, and gently tap the fibers into the part while holding your other hand over your forehead to keep fibers off from there. You may have to do a quick wipe of your forehead with a tissue. If you have a lot of fibers on your forehead, you are tapping too much and too hard - or you didn't seal off 50% of the shaker with painter's tape. It does not take a lot to make your hair look fuller, just a tap-tap-tap and them move on to the next area.  This would not work well for extensive baldness (nothing does!), but works well for the dreaded "wide part" problem. Dark hair would be more of a challenge on a light-skinned person, as the contrast between hair and scalp would make the fibers show more than with medium brown hair.  They have a really small travel-size that I carry in my handbag, so you can try it without spending much $...you would not have to tape the shaker part on that one!  One suggestion for Toppik company is to make the darn container transparent - it is completely opaque, so there is no way to know when you are running out, except to shake it in the sink. Dumb, as people would order sooner, if they knew they were running low.	1
I can not Live without it !!!! Is a parte of my everyday life and routine	1
A must for me!!!! Always need to have it to fill those not so hairy spots!!!	1
It's pretty good.  A little on the dark side from the photo.	1
Have not been disappointed at all.	1
Thanks :)	1
So I have used this product for years and swear by it. I started losing my hair at a very young age. By the time I was in my 50's I really needed to do something. Thank God this product was introduced to me, it really has changed my life. I can now get dressed and go out with confidence because all I need to is spray my hair with hair spray and then add this product to the spots that are balding. It makes a huge diffference and I recommend it to anyone who has hair loss. I  uaw it every day and no one knows I use anything! I have seen one negative review but I don't think she was using it correctly, otherwise she would not have had those issues. Also you must use the color that's closest to your hair color and you will have wonderful results!!	1
I love Toppik and am always happy with the results.  It lasts a long time and I use it daily.  I received it ahead of schedule and it was packaged well.	1
Performs as advertised	1
Sent on time and works as advertised	1
I get post-partem hair loss when my babies are 3-4 months old. This time was worse than last time and I had actual bald spots along with thinning right at the FRONT of my hairline! This stuff is great. You couldn't see the bald spots and it seemed to thicken the new baby hairs growing back in. I bought the applicator and it worked great. I am now at 7 months post partem and I don't need to use it as much, but I still have about half the container left. I will save it for my next baby. The only thing I will mention is that these fibers do cling. So, make sure to shake your head a bit, maybe finish getting ready and then wipe off your face and clothes if you have to. Also, I have very dark hair and used the dark brown color, so I can't rate the other colors.	1
this product gets a coveted 5-star rating. Those were looking for hair on a bald head should look elsewhere though. You must have some hair in order for this to give the appearance of a thicker head of hair. I have very fine hair and you can see my scalp through my hair. This product does an incredible job of covering that.it is very easy to apply and I strongly recommend you get the sprayer attachment.if you have very thin hair this is definitely the product for you	1
I was very skeptical about this product, but I bought a smaller bottle on sale at Sally's and it is AMAZING. My thinning hair has been my biggest source of insecurity for the past ten years. It is all I could focus on when I looked at myself in pictures or when getting ready. I was sure everyone was always thinking "she would be pretty if her hair wasn't so THIN". This stuff works! It covers up the visible scalp and you cannot tell it is a topical "fiber" unless you get your eyes centimeters away. I have had so many compliments on how my hair looks and I recently had family pictures taken - I know without this product I would have just been sad about how awful my thinning part looked - now I post pictures with confidence. Only wish I would have tried it sooner!! Now I bought the largest size available from Amazon and it is less than half the price of Sally's. I hope they never stop making it!!  Update 5/13/2017: I don't know when Amazon increased their price but they need to reconsider! I had been buying it from Amazon loyally but a $38 increase from the Toppik website price is crazy! Went to the company website and autosubscribed to get the same product for $71/month instead of the $115 Amazon now charges. Very disappointed.	1
been using this product for years	1
I use this product since 2 years ago and now I can not live without it.  My hair is too thin and not abundant so when I use it, is like having instant blower	1
This product clings to the hair fibers much better than most others that sit on your scalp. Plus the value is pretty much as good as it gets for a keratin fiber. I use it in conjunction with Toppik, but it works fine by itself as well.	1
Been using this for years to hide my scalp spots.  Works great!	1
Color is way lighter then posted.	-1
I love this product, works well, covers any thin areas and you can't even notice it - just really wonderful, and this colour is great for dark hair.	1
I mix it with the light blonde to get closer to my shade.  Good product, just hard to tell colors from picture.	1
Picture shows red in it.  There is no red and it is much lighter than picture.  will have to mix with med. blonde.	1
Great product for covering up thinning hair	1
I would recommend this to anyone that still has hair but is balding and can't stand those tell tale shiny spots that say you have thinning hair. I've been using it for about 3 years and cannot tell you how much it has done for my self esteem.  If it weren't for Toppik, I would have to be wearing full wigs by now but with a few sprinkles of Toppik after I do my hair and just before I put a final spray on and head out the door. I hope you try it and put your own review up about what a difference it made for you!	1
For a few more dollars I could've gotten a much BIGGER bottle!!!!!!!! Content amount is Not worth it!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a rip off to buy this item for that amount	-1

I have VERY thin hair on the top and front of my head. I'm a 41 yr old female with female pattern baldness. I have medium brown  curly hair. Based on previous reviews I chose light brown. I'm happy I did me because it blended perfectly. To apply I found the spray applicator works best for me. I dry and style my hair and then gently lift sections up and holding the sprayer 3-6" above my hair, give shallow "poofs" to the shaft and 2-3" in length from my scalp. Then I lay the hair back in the desired style and generally mist the hair in the thinnest spots-patting the hair to gently push it into the hair itself. Then light spray with hairspray. I have also not used hair spray and it stayed in place as well. It has never come off on my pillow or my clothes. The only issue I have is getting too close to my scalp- it can become polka dots in my bald spots if not careful. If you have a small bald spot this would be fine, but my hair is so thin I would need a lot of product to cover my scalp. Toppik plumps the hair I have and dusts my scalp in color to minimize my scalp showing. My husband thinks it looks really natural- he didn't know what I had done but kept saying how good my hair looked. He was surprised when I told and showed him the product. He had no idea it was fibers! Part of what really makes my hair look thicker is that this product is great to make your hairline part look thinner and thus making your hair appear fuller. To keep a straight part line, lay a pipe cleaner on top of your part or use a piece of paper to cover the part line and then apply to Toppik over the paper/pipe cleaner. You will be amazed how minimizing your part maximizes the look of your hair! It's a good solution with little effort. Depending in your type of thinning/balding will determine if the product is successful for you. The product does attach to the hair you have and does appear thicker and it does not come off until you wash it. It did exactly what it promised to. Good luck!	1
at covering thinning areas of hair. I've never tried any other brand of hair building fibers but this one covers and blends well. Looks like your hair if you match the color properly. I have yet to find a way to keep it from spreading all over the sink and countertop in the bathroom though	1
This product is superior to other brands. I have tried them all and for me this is the best. Been using it for 2 years and it makes a huge difference in the appearance of my thin hair.	1

The Toppick Hair Building Fibers fill in the thinning areas on my scalp. It looks very natural, and others comment that my hair looks thiicker.	1
Toppick is easy to apply and covers the thinning spots on my scalp.  It looks natural, and people comment that my hair looks thicker.	1
The coverage is very good.  However, I find that my sink has particles in it after I use it, and it does come off on my pillowcase.  However, it does wash out.	1
I have ordered Toppik before and it must have been the real thing because it worked better. This one is like dust and doesn't look like hair at all. I recommend trying another product on Amazon. Perhaps the price has something to do with this but it is not the Toppik brand and does not work as well.	-1
I've been using this product for 14 years. GREAT PRODUCT! I only found out recently that I can get it cheaper on Amazon.	1
I am African American and have been a fan for quite a while. I use black for my thin edges. I recommended it to a church member who has some thinning issues. She reported that she loves it as well. I also use the spray applicator and holding spray which works well. However, I can just shake the powder on and go without the accessories and it stays all day. Non one can tell a thing.	1
Having used this product for over a year, finding the larger size available on Amazon is a huge money saver for me.  Thank You! However, an important fact to remember:  on the label, it states "avoid inhalation."  If used extensively with each application, be sure to wear a dust mask.  The tiny fibers will irritate your nasal passages.	1
This product give me the confidence to go out without wearing a hat. I have been using this for over a five years, I was lucky my sister shared it with me. I'm no longer concerned should someone take my picture from a a facial picture to one from behind. If you have thin hair this is the product to use.	1
This is great! I Couldn't live without it , my friend told me to try it cuz u was upset that I'm losing hair at a young age and being a woman. I use it after I wash and dry my hair. I keep it in my purse. Love it	1
There is only one thing to say  " it really works" Love it and no more bald looking spots !!!	1
I am a black woman with thin edges. I use this product on my edges when I want to pull my hair back it really camouflages my thin edges. I also ordered the pump to help evenly disperse the building fibers.	1
Great product I like it.  Great product I like it. Great product I like it. Great product I like it. But I do not like having to write extra words on this post!	1
My hair has been thinning for the last 15+ years and I have done everything to make up for it short of a transplant - wigs, weaves, etc. even though my own hair is quite long. I heard about Toppik and got this small travel size because I just had a hard time believing it would actually work, and I didn't want to risk too much money on it. Well, I absolutely LOVE Toppik! I'm a cook and an artist so I have a good hand, which meant I was successful in my first attempt at applying it and it only took a few minutes. just aim over the area, and tap the fibers on. The hair on the top of my head is quite thin, so I did have to apply more than some others might have to, but it does what it says, and I was so thrilled it brought tears to my eyes and I am buying a larger size. Yes, you can run your hands through it, and yes, you can style it. If you have thinning hair, I cannot recommend this product enough. TIPS: I read it before in the reviews and now I know it myself - get a shade lighter than your hair. I got the Dark Brown, and it looks almost Black upon application. I am able to get away with it, but my next order with be the medium brown and I will mix them. Also, if you need to apply a lot of it, which I did, it will result in the Toppik-treated area looking duller than the rest of your hair. I tried a little shine spray with my hair out and some holding gel with my hair up, and both seemed to work in getting the shine back. Some folks have complained of itching, but I haven't had that issue. I tried sleeping with it in just for giggles, and some came out, but not that much. I have not yet gotten it wet, so I cannot comment on that. If you're still skeptical, do what I did and at least try the travel size so your risk is minimal. But I am a happy customer - no more wigs and weaves and I can finally have my own hair out without being self-concious. Thank you, Toppik!!	1
Does exactly what it says it will do and doesn't cake on your hair.  And it looks very natural. Buy a shade lighter than your natural color.	1
I use this product every day and love the way it helps to cover the thin spots in my hair.  I will order it again.	1
This works really well to cover areas needed. I love it and use it often. Highly recommended. You should try it.	1
I absolutely LOVE this stuff!! It covers your scalp and seems to make your hair seem fuller. I no longer worry that people will see my balding head. It even helps kind of cover my gray hair at the roots. I really do love Toppik! It works great!	1
This is a life saver - I could not live without it.  I have a full head of hair, but there's one spot on the top of my head that is thinning out and I'm very self concious, so instead of going through a transplant, this does the job.  A friend of mine that had the same problem but she has her hair with highlights, uses it as well, and she has 2 bottles, one in light medium brown and another blonde, and she uses both at the same time.  It looks great	1
I've been using this product for over 10 years and I wouldn't be without it. If you can't afford hair transplants, then this is the way to go. Don't use any spray product!	1
I have about spot in the middle top of my head and I'm always looking for ways to conceal it sometimes I click in Hair extensions and other times a black permanent marker. this is good for on the go or a night out. If your brush your hair too much it will come out by if you're out at night usually don't do that anyway.	1
I use this every day I would recommend this for anyone who has special needs with thinning hair, it has made a huge difference in my daily life.	1
So I have tried this product before and have always loved it. I it bought from the Amazon site because I found it at a much cheaper price than I would normally buy it.  Thanks for offering this great product at a great price!  Pam	1
I have a child suffering from Trichotillomania and will say that this stuff has been a life saver.  We are able to avoid the need of a wig thanks to this product.  I'm not saying it is a perfect product because it can be scratched off or easily removed by water so it isn't an option for swimming, but I'm thrilled with it because my child is able to go to school without a wig which is very big deal for us.	1
I've been using this since around 2002 and couldn't go a day without it. It gives me a sense of confidence!	1
Okay, here is what how you use this product: Do not peel off the sticky film under the lid, instead use a matte knife to cut out a triangle shaped piece, so that the film looks like a pizza with one big slice missing. Then not so much will come out and you will have better control and it will last much longer. You do not shake it on to the roots of your hair where you can see the scalp, you tap it gently, moving it where you can see your scalp. If you shake it near your front hairline, you may have to wipe a dusting off your forehead with a tissue, but it comes right off.  I use this every day and it makes a huge difference, plus it bulks up the roots of your hair.  It is not for someone with a lot of baldness, more for thinning hair and where you can see your scalp.  Make sure to get the right color, too light and it will do nothing, too dark and it will look odd, but better too dark than light.  I wash my hair every other day, but I rinse it with water on the day I do not use shampoo, as Toppik can come off on your pillow.	1
I have used this product, along with other hair boosters, for several years now.  I swear by it.  The colors are very close and blend very well.	1
I love how easy it is to use this product.  It also works very well and lasts a long time.	1
I think the color did not match my hair correctly.  If I order another one, it will probably be the medium brown instead of the light brown.	-1
shows like I have put dried mustard in my hair. After a couple of hours, it's gone. Will not try again.	-1
It takes too long to cover the patches. The colour was too dark for brown. It was like black. It cannot be used for large areas of baldness.	-1
I used to use another brand, but the next morning all my head started to scratch, but this one is great.  new life, back youth ;) But the price almost doubled in a day!	1

I went through a major hair shed a couple of years ago, which was when I got my first Toppik Fibers. This product has helped preserve my vanity by hiding my widening part and other thin spots on my head. Toppik blends in so nicely and stays put until your next wash. I don't use the spray nozzle attachment, I just sprinkle it on and pat it out to blend in, as they demonstrate in the video on Toppik's website.  I've never seen residue on my clothing or pillowcase (however, fine dust does fly everywhere when applying it, so get dressed AFTER application!). The stuff doesn't even bleed out after a tough, sweaty workout either. As far as the colors, after some trial and error, I mostly use medium brown, which is more of a dark than a golden brown shade. I've also tried light brown, but that shade is more of a dark ash blonde and I had to blend the medium and light to make it work. I ended up dyeing my hair a little darker so I can stick to the medium brown and keep things simple.  The only negative is that the fine dust settles on my white bathroom counters after application, but is easily cleaned up. Right now Amazon has the best price on this product, costing $10 less than at beauty supply stores. I've also tried Caboki, which for me was of inferior quality, lasting power and had a funny rubber-like smell (Toppik has no scent whatsoever).	1
This is a life saver !!  I have 2-3 spots on top of my head where the hair is thinning - and I don't want to launch myself into getting hair plugs so a few shakes of this and problem solved !!!	1
I have used this product for 4 years now.  I love it so much.  Easy to apply and helps cover up my embarrassing situation.	1
When I started thinning on top of my head I knew I needed to do something.  I'm a female age 56 and I think Menopause was the reason for my thinning hair.  Anyway, when anyone was talking to me they would always scroll with their eyes up to my head looking at the thin parts.  I became very embarrassed, especially when the wind blew it was worse.  Since using Toppik I'v notice they do not look at my thinning head anymore.  But, sometimes in the sun when the wind blows it's a little more apparent.  I will continue to use this product.	1
This product was a life saver for me. My hair has continually got thinner and I really didn't want to buy a wig. A friend told me about this and I can't believe how well it covers thinning areas. You just have to make sure after applying the resisdue isn't on your forehead or back. But it's a great product and worth every penny....	1
I have some thinning in my part, and have been using Joan River's Great Hair Day for years. It gives a slight itch sometimes but is easy to brush on and gives full coverage. I bought the Toppik after reading reviews of no itch and how it works better than Great Hair Day. I kept shaking it on my head and it didn't look like the powder even came out. Then I slowly see a pile of powder forming on my hair, and I had to mix it in with my fingers. I even tried using the Great Hair Day brush, to no avail - the brush didn't pick up on the Toppik powder. I used the Toppik applicator for parts which I bought seperately, but that didn't work well either. I'm back to using Great Hair Day and the Toppik is sitting ignored in my closet.	-1
This stuff is great for thinning hair, but you need some hair for it to adhere to.  It's keratin, which I believe is a protein that is part of the structure of hair and it looks very natural, if you choose the right color.  Even a hairdresser couldn't tell I was using it until she washed my hair.  It comes out easily with shampoo, but can last for a day or two if you don't wash your hair.  It makes your hair look so much thicker and that is saying something.  My hair is so thin in the back that my scalp shows through, but with Toppik, you can't tell.  Even if someone was sitting behind you, like in church, I don't think they would pick up on the fact that you are using it.  Men, if your head is totally bald, you know, shiny, I don't think this is for you, but if you are thinning and still have a fair amount of strands of hair left, this could work for you.  Be sure to get the color closest to the rest of your hair.  I believe they even have grey.  I use either the dark brown or the light brown depending on the shade that I have my hair dyed.  Also, it doesn't come off on my pillow like the Joan Rivers junk, and the medium size can lasts pretty long. It's expensive, sort of, but worth it.  Definitely cheaper than a wig or toupee.  As soon as I open a new container, I order another one, just to make sure that I never run out.  The best price I have found is on this website. Sally's Beauty Supply is much more expensive, as is the Toppik website.	1
Works great to hide thinning hair patches. Just shake on the areas that are thinning. Works by concealing balding scalp areas - the micro fibers lay on top of your scalp darkening the area so your otherwise shiny noggin doesn't show thru the thinning hair. Also somewhat thickens the appearance of hair. Withstands wind pretty well & moisture to some degree. Washes out easily with shampoo and water. Will also rub off on your hands if you run your hands thru your hair. Is purely a cosmetic fix to hiding hair loss. For it to work well, it's necessary for there to be some hair, even if it is fine and short, present to which the fibers can adhere and fill in. Best for concealing small patches. Causes me no irritation and don't even know I'm using it.  It helps to apply a fine hairspray to keep Toppik topic in place, but I rarely need to do this. If I do, I use a Tresemme extra fine mist spray. The scent is mild and doesn't leave you with Old Lady Aquanet smelling helmet hair. You can use any hairspray you like - Consort, American Crew, etc.  To get the best control over where the fibers go, it's best to hold the can as close to the head as possible and ever so lightly aggitate the can to shake just enough and where you want it. There is no reason to hold it high above the head - in fact, if you do, fiber will go every which way and may go where its not needed. They make a special applicator for the can to "spray" the fiber, but I find it more efficient to just apply keeping the regular can shaker top close to the head. For the front close to the hairline, it's best to apply back away from the hairline at first and let the fibers naturally fall forward as needed. If you apply too close to the hairline, it may look too fake. You can always come a bit closer and apply.  Works well for men and women alike. Has no scent.  Get the color that best matches your hair color. You can use 2 different colors if you are looking for a special match, but I find the Dark Brown works just find for my typical dark brown hair.  I'm a 40 yr old guy with thinning hair, but I still want to wear a pomp. Fortunately, I just have some thinning patches and not extensive balding such as MPB on top. Toppik works for me even if I use pomade to get the pomp look I like. I apply Toppik after greasing up and getting my hair partially styled. I'll add Toppik as needed to the thinning spots as I comb and style. The pomade actually seems to help keep Toppik adhering better and covers my thinning patches well. I've found that using a water based pomade as a base works best and then using a petrolatum/wax based pomade as a topper for shine really helps. I add the Toppik after applying pomades. You can add more pomade if you need to, but I usually then need to add a bit more Toppik since some will inevitably come out on your hands when applying pomade to hair that already has Toppik applied.  The stuff is not waterproof and will come out if you get your head soaked.  Face it guys, there's no miracle cure for hairloss - yet. Toppix is a good cosmetic choice for hiding hairloss, but if you're bald or otherwise don't have at least some hair to which Toppix can blend into, this may not work for you. You can always buy one of the smaller sizes to try out if unsure.	1
Great product! I would recommend this to anyone who contends with thinning hair.  It is easy to use and it isn't too expensive.	1
I've been using this product for several months now and I like it very much. In my "middle age" with the crown of my head thinning significantly, I find that Toppik is the perfect product to fill in the gaps on my gleaming white scalp. It makes my hair look thicker, and is not nearly the hassle of a wig or a hair piece. The downside, is that it can be a little itchy and you can't really scratch it with your fingers without getting the dye under your nails..a pencil works well though. Also, it should be used with hairspray to keep the fibers in place. I don't much like hairspray and have rarely used it, but all the above is still worth it when I'm out on the town and am feeling self conscious about my thinning hair. Recommended for anyone with thinning hair, or small balding areas, men or women.	1
This is a really helpful product for my fine hair.  I wish there was an easier way to apply other than shaking from the bottle.	1
Purchased for my elderly mother who constantly laments her thinning hairline. Although this is obviously a superficial solution, it does make her feel like she has more hair in front. A little tricky to apply (it is a fine powder, afterall), and tends to get all over the place. But used judiciously, desired results can be achieved with some practice. Not sure if she will repurchase, but at least for now it offers an easy solution for bald spots. It basically just colors your scalp like shoe polish, doesn't really thicken fine hair as claims.	1
My hair dresser told me about Toppik's Hair Building Fibers because one of her clients has had success using it.  Toppik is intended to make your scalp appear as if it has hair in the right places.  This illusion is created by the tiny keratin particles bonding to your own hair.  If your scalp is actually bald and there is no hair that is combed over it, this product isn't going to work for you.  That said, it does wonders for those of us with thinning hair.  Just be sure to get the correct color that matches your own.  For example, the light blonde is strictly for those with very light, platinum blonde hair.  If your hair has the least bit of ash or red tone in it, opt for the medium blonde Toppik.  After you have dried your hair (using all of the products you normally apply), sprinkle the Toppik onto the areas that need to look fuller.  Lightly tap the area to help the keratin particles `grasp' the hair.  Once you have filled in these spaces, you may lightly style your hair.  Vigorous brushing will remove Toppik so, don't do it.  Toppik should remain in place until you brush or shampoo. Applying Toppik is fairly simple.  Begin by sprinkling it a little at a time until you see the desired effect.  If you are placing it near your hairline, Toppik offers a tool for putting it in a small, defined area.  (I just hold a tissue on my face to avoid having it settle on my skin.)  The top of the jar is wide so, if you want to cover a very small area, the tool could be quite handy.  For even greater results, I recommend Toppik's Hair Fattener.  This is a leave-in treatment.  The results I have with it are impressive.  It works by making the hair appear a little thicker.  I have been using it for about six weeks and even my husband can see a small difference in the thickness of my hair.  (Toppik's claim is that continued use will make a permanent change in the thickness of the hair.) Using both products together will really help you look like you have no gaps of hair.  I still use another product (a colored powder) that I brush onto my scalp to help cover the sparser areas in front.  But, I use far less of it with Toppik's products.  When your hairdresser marvels at how good your hair looks, you know you've got a real solution to your problem.	1
My stylist told me about Toppik when she noticed how thin my hair was getting to be. She purchased the 0.36oz/10.3g for me from the local beauty supply. Even with her discount it was almost $25. But I really liked how Toppik camouflages my thin spots. Only a couple of people have noticed that there is something different with my hair. Only one person realized what the difference was, and only because she'd also used Toppik.  Toppik is now a must-have product for me so I started looking for a better bargain and found it here. I get almost more than twice the product for only a few $ more.  I would definitely recommend Toppik to anyone.	1
My hair is starting to thin on top.  I have some volumizing shampoo that works well but sometimes I can still see too much scalp when I finish combing my hair.  I sprinkle a little bit of the toppik and it covers all the scalp and makes my hair look fuller.  Well worth the money.	1
This product looks natural, stays in place, and works to cover the scalp and thicken my thin, fine, hair. I use it everyday.	1
The product was as I expected.  I have used this product for sometime now, and am please with the results I get.	1
I have been using this product for over a year now, and I recommend it to anyone that has thin hair on the top of the head.  The color blends in well with my own haircolor, and it adds body and texture to my own thin strands. I do try and add a side part using a thin comb or pick in order for a more natural look, otherwise it can sometimes look like a wig without a natural hairpart. I am a young woman, and without this product I would go back to  feeling  very self -conscience and uncomfortable in public. Note: Would probably not work as well on bald heads or severe hair loss.	1

Love this stuff! -it doesnt flake everywhere like some of the other products do. -it makes you hair look fuller -it hides grays between colors -it doesnt rub off onto clothes You want to make sure you get it on the ROOTS/Scalp.. brush hair afterward to knock off "extra" and use hairspray.  It will look awesome and STAY PUT. Been using this for 2 years now and tried SEVERAL types before I found this... if I was a "prep per" I would stock food, water, emergency supplies and THIS for the vanity side of me.	1
It does what it says it will do and it makes my hair look a lot thicker and makes it easier to style.  I add it after my hairspray so that my hairspray doesn't get it wet.	1
I love it.  The coverage is complete and it stays until I wash it out.  The price is good too!	1
I was so pleasantly surprised at just how well this product works. I had previously used Great Hair Days powder and the Toppik fibers blows it out of the water! I have severe thinning of my hair in the front, due to weight loss and am very self conscious about it. This product has restored my confidence! It is easy to learn to use and gives a very nice finished look, I Highly recommend it! I WILL be buying it again. Good Luck all :)	1

It really does the job! I am a woman with thinning hair.  I use the medium brown and it stays in until I shampoo my hair.  It doesn't rub off on my pillows and the .87 oz can last a surprisingly long time.  I highly recommend this product, it's so much better than the other things that I tried.  The Joan Rivers product was the worst.  It rubbed off on my pillows and the headrest in my car.	1
For those of us with thinning hair, this is the perfect solution to give us the look of more hair.  I've used it for years and no one has ever known that I use it.	1
My husband has been using Toppik for awhile now. It is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots. My husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head, which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair. And in the sun, it actually turns a pinkish red (he uses dark brown)! The claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie. Even with a bit of wind or humidity, the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face, making it look like tar. It leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets. I would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity because my husband truly believes that I still don't know that he uses the product! Toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair. Using Toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind, constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product, and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place. Instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it doesn't even bother me, my husband constantly obsesses over his hair. Instead of enhancing his look, Toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place. Instead of boosting his confidence, Toppik has made him even more insecure about losing his hair.	-1

My husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head, which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair.  And in the sun, it actually turns a pinkish red (he uses dark brown)!  The claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie.  Even with a bit of wind or humidity, the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face, making it look like tar.  It leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets.  I would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity  because my husband truly believes that I still don't know that he uses the product!  Toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair.  Using Toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind, constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product, and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place.  Instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it doesn't even bother me, my husband constantly obsesses over his hair.  Instead of enhancing his look,  Toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place.	-1
Discovered this product from my hairdresser. It is for thinning hair and is like magic. Just style your hair and sprinkle this on the thinning areas that show. It blends with your hair and looks like you have a full head of hair. I will never be without it!!	1
Im so glad to find this! It covers my spots of thin hair by shading the scalp. Give it a try.	1
I've been thinking about doing a hair transplant to fill in those thinkin spots but a friend recommended toppik and i am totally satisfied and highly recommend it.	1
very good product, fast shipping and have used it before, color is good for blondes, very good as far as using it to cover spots	1
I've used this product for years.  It totally works and fills in the hair that I've lost.  It makes the difference between looking nearly bald and having hair.  I recommend this to anyone with thinning hair.	1
I'm a 50ish woman who has noticed thinning areas on the to of my head, this product has been wonderful for me, it covers,doesn't clump, run or even look like I'm wearing anything to disguise the area. I am so satisfied, I brought it over to my hairdresser, and she uses it on her clientele..There is one thing though, the bottom of the bottle is weighted and I'm never sure when I'm running low..wish they could address that...	1
I didn't like this product at ALL.  It clumped when I put it on.  I will never buy it again.	-1
I'm a 50 year old woman who is experiencing hair thinning in some areas on my scalp. I couldn't make a part before I used Toppik, It blends into your scalp and nobody knows that it's on. I highly recommend this. I tried the travel size first and was hooked. Try it you won't be sorry.	1
I love this product.  It gives me so much confidence when I go out in public.  It covers thinning areas very well.  I would recommend this to anyone who is thinning and can not pay for a hair transplant.	1
This produce may be applied in just moments to achieve a very efficient results, any time of the day.	1
Great product and covers up thinning hair areas very well! Highly recommended but make sure to use some hair spray so that the fibers will stay in place!	1
I always re-order this product. My previous reviews no longer exist because the reseller is gone so I am going to c&p my original review.  I'm an African American male with thinning hair on the sides as well as top due to over processing my hair as a youth. It makes it difficult to get a nice even haircut and I can't where the low to bald styles since I have acne keloiditis around the rear hairline which causes hair loss and unattractive keloids. It's so embarrassing that I don't even like for people to stand behind me on the elevator. One day I discovered Toppik and although no one in the videos had my type of hair I thought what the hell, it's worth a try.  Toppik has completely changed my life. It's not perfect but look at it like makeup. It covers up just enough so that if you didn't tell people they wouldn't know. I have confided in 2 or 3 close friends that I started using it and asked if they saw any difference. They said "That stuff is F--- AMAZING!" If you have thinning or balding hair, scalp issues to cover up it's worth the money.  It's not gonna stay on overnight. It's not going to stay put on the sides or back under a hat. I've even tried holding spray and it will work but I personally have to gel my hair so hard that it's not favorable all the time. Those are the only downsides. Take it from me and my friends..it works and its amazing :)	1

Very good product and really does give the impression that you have more than you really do! I highly recommend if you are looking for a quick and easy way to cover up thinning hair!!	1
I've waited a bit to write this review.  I've got a good size bald/thinning spot on the crown of my head.  A couple of months ago I decided to try Toppik after my barber recommended it.  It has taken a while to get the routine down and learn to apply it just right.  I've been very happy but yesterday proved to me what a great product this is.  I never told anyone what I was doing.  People kept asking me if I had just gotten a haircut.  They knew something had changd, but couldn't figure out what it was.  Yesterday I was out for a walk qith my partner of 30 years and a friend.  While I was walking in front of them my partner said "What did you do to your hair?"  I cringed.  I thought that he had noticed that I had put something on it and it showed.  I aksed him what he meant.  He said that my bald spot was gone.  He then got right up on top of me and looked at my hair.  He could not tell what I had done, but my bald spot was gone.  My friend touched it and said that it was soft.  If I could fool them I could fool anyone.  Even looking for it they couldn't tell.  Like I said, it took a bit to get the application down just right.  This should not discourage you, you just need a little practice. I wash my hair, blow dry it and apply the Toppik, using a hand mirror to see the back.  I use the Toppik until I get good coverage, brush it and then use a light spray of Tresseme hairspray.  It kind of seals it on the hair and keeps everything in place, but it is not stiff.  Most days this is just a minute or so.  You don't need to blowdry if you just let your hair dry naturally, but don't use the Toppik on wet hair.  I think that it would clump.  Also the blow dryer give the hair a bit of volume which helps.  Give it a try!	1
I was trying all types of products to thicken my thinning hair.  Nothing worked.  Minoxidil only helps in slowing down the process but does nothing for covering the thinning spots.  This product really works.  It really does work in covering areas that are thinning, and your friends will not be able to tell the difference.  It will last all day, the only draw back, it will wash off if your hair gets too wet.  It is also best to use hair spray to keep it in place.	1
I hope they make this product for a long time.  My hair has thinned out a lot, with this product you can not tell. If you are thinning, this well make you feel better and look great, really! I will buy it until something better comes along.	1
I found this on Amazon and bought the smaller size to try it out.  It is fabulous for people that are going thin on top.  I highly recommend this product.	1
I love this product.  It does exactly as it says.  It covers your balding spots and makes your hair appear fuller.  If you are losing hair but still have some strands of hair that this product can cling to, then this is for you.  If you attempt to put this product on bald skin, then forget it, you will look ridiculous.  This product needs some hair to cling to and believe me, it will appear fuller and no one will be able to tell. You can comb your hair after putting this on, but don't rub your head too much or else it will come off little by little.  But it beats buying a hair piece or hair transplant.	1
I'm in my early 30's and have a receding hairline. You ever sleep with hairspray on your hair and to wake up next morning with linty hair? That's exactly how I would describe the texture when you use this on your hair. I purchased color black with the pump sprayer, pick/comb, and their hairspray. I accidently sprayed the toppik powder onto my scalp and noticed the toppik color was more like dark purple. It takes a while to perfect the use of the pump to get the right amount of Toppik sprayed only onto the hair. No matter how perfect your results come out, up real close you can notice something different and I'm sure under the direct sunlight it's probably 10X more noticeable. Toppik claims that people can't even notice 2 inches away, that's bull. This is definitely a better product than Couvre the scalp concealer. Toppik hairspray is like any other strong hold hairspray, absolutely nothing advanced or special about it. The comb is a piece of crap, made out of cheap paper/plastic not even worth a quarter! Go to a dollar store and find yourself a better comb. Toppik comes off easily so avoid moisture even your sweat, wind, and any objects & elements disrupting the do. The money and the time you have to spend to get a half decent look in my honest opinion is not worth it. I rather deal with a wearing a hat then worrying about an embarrassing toppik malfunction. Maybe if you're in your 60's and not as concerned about the natural look then more power to you, but I still think people are over paying for a product that doesn't promise what they claim. I'm currently trying a product called NuHair. I'm taking the vitamin and using their hair serum. I'm only on the second month and hoping to see some results within the next few months. There are no cheap quick fixes that lasts forever so I'm going to commit to this NuHair program for 5-6 months and hope for the best. Figure hair transplant takes up to 6 months anyways so might as well give the natural method a 6 month commitment. If the natural way fails then Rogaine is a possibility and then hair transplant. Bottom line, my girlfriend thinks I wasted my money on this product (toppik) and I'm going to have to agree with her on this. Hope you guys learn from my mistake. If you guys know of any good hair transplant doctors in the bay area CA let me know. Good luck fellas.	-1

Works fast and really covers the thin spots.  Just be sure you pat it in and give it a spray with the holding spray. Otherwise it might flake off.  Washes off easily.	1
My hair is naturally curly but has been thinning for several years. It finally reached a point where it was noticeable.  Being a woman in the performing arts I realized I needed to take action before it became too obvious.  I started to use Minoxidil, thickening shampoos, and hair vitamins. My hair is healthier and there are signs things might be getting better. However, the process takes too long so I wanted something in the meantime that I could use to help me regain my confidence.  I found it in Toppik. So easy to use and the results are immediate.  I even went out in windy weather and wasn't afraid that my thin spots would show.  Whether or not the Minoxidil works, I know I can use this product for as long as I want and no one, not even my husband, notices! Get the 10 gram first to be sure you like it, but then go ahead and get the bigger bottles with holding fiber hairspray.	1
I wanted to like this product. I had read about it on a site other than Amazon. I was looking for a good product for my oily hair.  This product was so watery that I couldn't get it from my hands to my hair no matter how hard I tried.  I tried to use it several times, but I finally gave up and threw it away.	-1
My main complaint with this stuff is that it ships in a glass jar. That makes it difficult to toss into my bag for traveling.  That said, just a little bit provides enough control without leaving my hair stiff. Based on its texture and consistency, I was a little afraid that it would leave my hair looking "wet" all day, but that is not the case, at least with the amount that I use.  There is a slight fragrance, but it is more pleasant than not (a bit of citrus, I guess) and it does not linger.  All in all, good stuff. I might heat it up a little and pour some into a plastic tube for traveling, though.	1
Definitely the same quality as the Hard Water but with a bit less hold. What I really like about these pomades is the natural look and feel they leave and the ease that they wash out. My first experience with Baxters was through Amazon Vine almost a year ago. I've been buying them since. I'll probably go back to the Hard Water since my hair is really fine and doesn't hold without a lot of help but I could happily recommend the Soft Water just as easily as the Hard Water.	1
My mussy hair needs product. There's no getting around it. My locks are a hairy wicket's nest in the morning, and needs washing, brushing, cursing, threatening, and the right product to look even halfway decent in the morning.  Or else it just needs this.  This stuff was just perfect for my hair. It held it in place while still being movable and touchable. Friends commented on how my hair looked. It washed out nicely and didn't leave flakes of gunk on my brush and comb.  This was perfect for everyday use, for the office, for meetings with vendors and executives, and even the occasional night out. Good casual product for the stylish gentleman.	1
Hair gel products are hit and miss with me. My hair is very thin with no wave so its anyones guess whether a product will be effective with me. I ordered  this product because I really liked Baxter's facial mask. The bad news is this product just didn't work for me. It is very greasy no matter how little you happen to use. I tried it several different ways and it just came up short. This is not to say the product might not be great on someone else. It just didn't work for me.	-1
Both this version and the water pomade remind me of my son's Butch Wax when he was a kid. A sticky waxy product that you put in his hair to hold his flat top straight up. They appear to have that micro glitter in them or something that makes them sort of silvery. If I had time, I'd work the Slick pomade through my hair bit by bit, I think it would work great for definition and curl. But I don't, I use it for the front of my hair that tends to get very frizzy. It works for that and works to hold some lift in the front section without the use of hairspray. Be forewarned that they assume you know how to use this product as it comes with zero instructions or suggestions. The ingredients are on a little folded label stuck to the bottom and so if you're not an experienced pomade user, look it up on the internet.  Oh, just did a Google search - this is for MEN!! lol - I got it on the Vine program and didn't realize that since it didn't say "for men" anywhere on it. They do talk about it on a youtube video as being waxy and sticky but not leaving your hair feeling that way, and I have to agree. Guess I'll give this to one of my guy friends. Too funny! I did like the scent which was a faint citrus smell. I still may keep it to style the front of my hair and keep the frizzies down, plus I'm planning on cutting my shoulder length hair off, so...  The Soft Water Pomade - is less sticky, but not by much, but it does allow me to mix it with water in my  hands and smooth it throughout my hair. I still can't believe this is for guys...I mean women have pomades. Perhaps it's traditionally a guy thing. (pomades for your pompadour!)	1
This pomade is very light - won't make your hair feel stiff - with a great texture and aroma.  You almost can't tell you are using product in your hair.  It is a good choice if you want a soft style for your hair, not so great if you want a very firm and textured look.	1
This is a very nice pomade. It is not the greasy, waxy pomade of old, but an easy to wash out product that does not dry out or get hard. The smell is light.	1
A great neutral smelling hair gel that is not sticky to apply to wet hair.  the only downer is that it is not that strong when applied to wet hair, but was better when applied to dry hair.  I didn't have to use much when applying to dry hair ... and it did not leave the hair sticky at all.  Worked well with heat, i use a hair straightener and that it seemed to style the hair better.  you kinda have to play with it with the different way thjat finish your hair styling adn particularly hair style, for sure.	1
I wanted my husband to try a new way to style his hair but we're totally lost in the realm of what seems like endless varieties of pomade. I'm glad I got this one. It leaves his hair soft and not sticky, yet keeps the style nicely. I will keep purchasing.	1
I dislike most hair products, but pomade is an exception. Its waxy texture helps keep hair manageable without making it stiff. It leaves it with a nice shine without looking artificial.  After a recent haircut that left me a little disappointed, I opened the glass jar of Baxter of California Soft Water Pomade, dipped my fingertip into the contents then applied it to my hair. Suddenly, my waves could be easily manipulated into place, and the disappointing haircut was a disappointment no longer.  This is good stuff. I recommend it.	1
Previously, my goto pomade was Sticky Rice by Cibu.  I have slightly coarse, medium length hair.  The Cibu was decent, although I thought the hold was a little weak.  Enter Baxter.  I haven't heard of this brand before, but I was impressed by the packaging.  The thick glass container felt nicely weighted and high quality.  The tight fitting screw-on cap was nice too.  Upon application, the pomade felt like a thicker Vaseline.  Hold/grip were excellent, lasting throughout the day.  Yet, the pomade did not feel greasy and washed away very easily in the shower.  I'm definitely interested in Baxter's other products now.	1
This is just a terrific product which doesn't feel like the typical "product" (i.e. hair gel) at all.  Using just a light touch with it and combing it into wet hair directly after showering, I found it provided a light but useful hold without even a hint of the shiny, plasticky feel of other gels.  This pomade provided a completely natural, plain-hair look and a soft, natural hair-feeling hold, far preferable to the sticky or over-rigid feel of more aggressive products.  Recommended.	1
This has a very light, fresh scent that dissipates, and is probably not going to attract bugs like some. It is slippery when put on wet hair but dries to a nice, natural finish. A little dab'll do ya, too, or you will get the greasies. It doesn't stick the hair together; it is more like a volumizing control product. Nice/	1
This delivers just the right amount of color....natural. It stays on and makes my lips stay moist. I have several of these, in my bag, in my desk, in my cosmetic bag....  I have tried hundreds is lip balms over the years....and this is the best one I have ever tried. This is a must have.	1
I couldn't wait to get this lip butter after hearing so many people rave about how good they were.  I must say I wasn't impressed, especially for the price!  I will stick to my nivea lip butters	-1
I love this stuff! It looks incredibly flattering with just about anything, giving my skin a nice warmth without looking like I ate a sloppy Joe. It lasts quite long if you put a nice coat on, and does not migrate to the edges as other balms and glosses can do. It is not at all sticky, either. It has a nice sheen, not too greasy, more satiny. It has a mild natural fruity flavor. I am no fan of using my fingers on the go, so it stays in my vanity at home, but since it lasts so long after it is applied, it works well. Pot lip glosses actually stay sanitary more than the kind you dip a wand into, so.....just make sure you wash your hands first!	1
On time shipping and, brand new!!	1
WORKS GREAT	1
Great hold and leave hair shiny.	1
I first came across this hairspray from my hairstylist. Then I found some at TJMaxx super cheap so I bought a can. I loved the first bottle of it, so next time I was at TJMaxx I bought every bottle they had, LOL! But since then I don't know if the texture of my hair has changed or what, but I don't like it anymore. It smells great but I ended up giving all of them to my Mom who does still love this! This is the only CHI hairspray I've ever tried so I can't really compare it to any other hairspray they offer. Maybe I'll try a firmer spray next time I want to try a CHI hairspray.	1
Great shampoo that leaves hair clean and shiny.	1
great shampoo. really great for dry, thin hair. I have alot of hair, but it is fine, and it is hard to find a hair product that keeps my hair moisturized. love this shampoo, but it will burn your eyes. tingles when you use it. I used another shampoo after this, and it left my hair dull and weak. this shampoo is the best!	1
Great smelling mint scent. Makes your scalp tingle and lathers up really well with just a little bit. Biolage used to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner until I got the abba Moisture shampoo and conditioner. Especially for normal or fine hair, if you use the shampoo and conditioner, your hair will come out like silk and lay perfect (with no weighed down residue feeling) after a blow dry!  One note I will make is that this is a new replacement product for the smaller more potent (and expensive) abba Moisture Scentsation shampoo. It is only a little less potent. You may have to use a bit more to get the same effect, but its worth the cost savings if you're not rich. If you are rich, get the older slightly better products here before they are gone. They got discontinued from what I understand due to this product replacing it. http://www.amazon.com/Abba-Moisture-Scentsation-Shampoo-Conditioner/dp/B001DAUKG0/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1361383065&sr=1-1-fkmr0&keywords=abba+mint+scentsation+shampoo	1
I have been using this for over a month and my hair looks great. Very soft and smells really good. Shampoo does not lather because it is sulfate free. Be sure an get the conditioner,  I got it too, and it works great!	1
I am a beauty product addict. Price doesnt matter to me, Ill try anything, and have tried an insane number of all things potion and lotion. My fave hair serum is $5. My fave face cream is $200. I mention this only because I want to be clear that I am not attracted to only higher end lines.  That said, I tend to have frizzy hair on the top layer. But as a mom who doesnt enjoy spending hours getting ready in the morning, and one who simply cant even spend more than 45 minutes weekdays (if Im lucky), I always struggle with this. I also don't want to use a flat iron every day, because my hair is starting to get fried from it and hair color.  I stumbled on this shampoo and conditioner somehow searching for products with a more natural lean, although I know some people have issues with some ingredients here. My hair is basically frizz free right as it dries thanks to this, and a little bit of my fave hair serum, and its almost perfect (its only ever "perfect" when I flat iron!). Soemtimes I don't even use the serum, and its still great.	1
love this pencil. goes on like silk and stays put! a must in my makeup arsenal.	1
this is one of the best liners I have tried.	1
I am a loyal customer and user of Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Eau De Parfume for years. Like I reviewed the Red Door EDP - Eau De Parfume - it seems that where ever I go when people ( MEN as well as Ladies) smell it on me they absolutely have to ask me "WHAT ARE YOU WEARING - YOU SMELL SO GOOD!" Because of the constant compliments of how GREAT I smell I decided that I would always buy and wear this perfume. When I wear ANY OTHER perfume I don't get any compliments. So why buy and wear anything else? After getting this perfume years ago and receiving so many fantastic compliments I decided to buy all the other products of Red Door. I do wear this deodorant and all the other products from Red Door daily. I love using this cream deodorant and it lasts such a long time too!  Another favorite of mine is the Red Door Perfumed Body Lotion and the Dusting Powder.  They all just compliment the Perfume. I wish they would come out with other products as well such as a liquid hand soap. My husband and daughter know that if they ever want to give me THE PERFECT GIFT they can't go wrong with Red Door!	1
I have been using Elizabeth Arden since 1990. I wasn't aware of the deodorant but it was well worth the expense. Reminds me of the good old days when I would shop at the Fashion malls in the state of Florida.	1
This cream deodorant works great for me ,the scent is nice not to strong and has lasted through the day even after a workout it still provided me with the protection I was hoping for I would order this again	1
I like this product and you don't need much. It works. I love all Phyto products but this one stands out.	1
This is a great product - no doubt about it. I have another review for a different phyto product which I switched to - the growth serum. This is great for hair density and growth which is why I originally purchased it. I know that the product is marketed for diminishing grays but I color my hair often and its difficult to assess the impact its had for that.	1
Good product for making skinny hair fat!	1
OK, I purchased this product hoping that my hair would be oh so much better after using it.  In some ways it is but I can't pinpoint it to this product as I purchased the conditioner as well.  So, I think the combination of the two has definitely made a difference and I can tell that my hair seems a bit thicker and a bit better feeling.  I would recommend you give it a try but decide on your own if it's working for you or not.  Sorry I can't be more specific	1
If you're familiar with Leslie Baumann's book _The Skin Type Solution_, this is one of the face washes she recommends for oily skin.  Since I also have sensitive skin (my skin type is OPWS), I was worried that it would be too drying for me, but I really do like this!  The foaming action is definitely more subtle than other foaming cleansers I've used, but it suds up nicely and has a light, pleasant scent that is non-irritating.  Since it contains salicylic acid, it's designed for oily and acne-prone skin.  I don't have acne (just the occasional pimple), but do have that classic oily T-zone, and this seems to help reduce the shine.  What I also like about this is that it is excellent at removing makeup; when I wipe a cotton pad with toner over my face after cleansing with this, no makeup residue is left on the cotton pad.  Since I am worried about this being too drying, especially as winter approaches, I will probably save this for nighttime use since it does an excellent job at removing makeup, and use something a bit less drying in the mornings.  I can also see this tube lasting a really long time since you only need a small amount of product to wash your whole face.  The price is high, but I will definitely re-purchase it when I run out since it works so well.	1
I did not like this face wash and was pretty disappointed because I am a huge La Roche-Posay fan. Their other products have really impressed me but this face wash burned my eyes so badly  even without getting it directly in them, just in the normal course of washing my face.  It also left my skin really really clean which may sound great but I couldn't help but feel it was stripping my skin of every single bit of moisture.  I swear my skin would make a squeaking noise when I rubbed my finger over it after using this.  So, no thank you, I would like to keep my moisture barrier.  Note:  I also tried the Purifying Foaming Cream Cleanser and it felt exactly the same.	-1
Foams and feels very clean.	1
I'm usually not one for perfumed face cleansers but every time I branch out from la Roche-Posay I find myself coming back soon after. I first came across the brand when my derm talked me into the Anthelios line for my fair skin. The sunscreens were awesome and when I started breaking out a few years later (not due to the sunscreen!) I turned to Effaclar. I go back and forth between this and the Mela-D, both are amazing. They are very very gentle cleansers that do an excellent job of deeply cleaning the skin without stripping it of too much moisture. Everytime I get a bout of acne I come back to Effaclar to get me back on the clear-skin track. The whole effaclar line is amazing but this cleanser is definitely holy grail status for me. It's a bit pricier than I like but it lathers so well that you need little more than a pea sized amount to thoroughly clean your face.  Note: This is a great product for most sensitive skins but if you're sensitive to fragrance I would definitely try something else.	1
Deep cleaning without drying...love it!	1
I love this product. The best part is the fact that it is a thick foam! Absolutely love washing my face with it! I will keep on purchasing these!	1
I've bought this several times, I'm #1 la Roche buyer because is the best out of all treatments I've used! Buy it with confidence	1
Your skin feels extremely clean. You don't need to use much to have a nice thick foam. I love it!!	1
Been using for years, gentle for skin, good cleaner, like it very much.	1
I love this stuff. This is my favorite of the La Roche-Posay Effaclar collection that I've purchased. I love the cream version of the cleanser over the gel version (which I've also tried). It really works and definitely seems to help clear up my skin! Just a little dab goes a long way, so this tube will be lasting me a long time.  I'll repurchase when my other cleansers are depleted. This stuff is awesome.	1
BURNED my skin, turned it red, acne and overall skin condition worsened overnight, after just ONE use. Continued use was a HUGE mistake. Took my skin a long time to recover.	-1
This is the best.  It was first recommended by my dermatologist, and I use with the Clarisonic.  My skin has been clear ever since.  Well worth the money!  It's the one product I'm loyal to!!	1
I really like La Roche-Posay's products.  This is a very good foam cleanser that cleans with out leaving your face feeling dry. I recently bought Noble Formula Zinc bar soap and I LOVE it. It  also cleans very well with out drying I will be using both.	1
I am almost 50 years old. Suddenly my skin started breaks out. I bought it and it works!! It cleared my skin nicely. I run out on the cleanser and used another line one I had. Of course my skin broke out. I run to my laptop and reorder it.	1
This is a lovely cleanser that foams up wonderfully. I rarely get any full on ugly nasty pimples because when there is any signs of them, I whip out this trusty cleanser and it significantly reduces the lifespan of the pimple. My pimple sort of shrivels up and die.	1
Got rid of my dry red spots immediately. I love Avene.	1
good stuff	1
Literally cannot live without this stuff now. It keeps my sensitive skin fresh and moisturized. It's helped the redness from my rosacea immensely. I spritz several times a day, even over makeup. It keeps my skin looking fresh and dewey. I just bought travel sized to take with me on trips.	1
Very nice product- can add moisture to your skin without adding product. I was impressed.	1
Very refreshing. Looking forward to using it in the summer and on vacation to cool off and keep skin hydrated. Will buy again. Very nice mist.	1
Another reviewed nailed it when she said the color is not what I expected.  Jasmine looks pink online so what a surprise to see a flesh-colored balm.  It is a truly hideous color on me and one that I never would've ordered if there was even a hint in the description that it would be flesh-toned.  I can't see that there's a way to salvage this color so will just toss it.  Money wasted.  So disappointed.	-1
I did not get a chance to buy it but if they have will buy it	1
Made lips burn. Yipes! Usually Korres is more gentle!	-1
Sexy glossy look! Love the soft color, very hydrating	1
This is my favorite, all-time lip tint. It is a stunning, sheer shade of red that literally looks wonderful on everyone. It's not sticky, waxy, and it doesn't feel like vaseline some other tinted balms I've had. It smells just like fresh, wet, garden roses and your lips are actually nicer at the end of the day after you wear it.  I have dry skin and lips, so I usually steer clear of tinted balms since I like to layer it on several times a day, and other products tend to cake on dry spots, or oversaturate my lips with color so I look like I did when I used Bonnie Bell products excessively in middle school. With this, the color is so sheer and high quality that even if you re-apply for extra moisture, it still stays natural-looking and smooth. You can even wear it on top of lipstick if you want to subtly play with colors.  This is definitely a staple product.	1
I love all the Korres line, but this lip butter is THE BEST especially in the winter. It keeps my lips hydrated, plus it gives you a little bit of color so you don't have to use lipstick on those cold days. I've been purchasing this lip balm for years and Mango is my favorite, I have an olive complexion and the mango flavor shows up coral. It has a very luxurious feel to it. Will always continue to repurchase	1
I love the Korres lip butters and own approximatley 4 different shades. This smells really nice - kind of sugary - and is really moisturizing. It has a slight tint, but looks very natural.	1
Wasn't sure how opaque this product would be applied, being a former Accutane user it's never the same trying to find quality lip balm ever again. I really like Korres, and this seemed to be the closest to a natural lip color on me (I'm a guy, mostly just wanted the moisture not the color). Definitely does a great job of that, the only comparison I have is the Neutrogena Revitalift for lips. Most of them are also colored, but they have been the best at fixing nasty dry lips without resorting to greasy impractical Aquaphor.	1
I wanted to reorder another color, but it is no longer available, so tried this.  Beautiful Rosy red color.  Almost translucent, so color looks very natural.  Almost like you bit your lips and color came up with a shine. Very moisturizing but wears off easily.  I can't wear many because they dry too much.  Not this one.	1
Personally I don't find that this gives lasting moisture to my lips. And as a lip butter you'd think it would more so than a regular balm. However I do enjoy it when it is on my lips, it smells great, but this is just doesn't do it what it is supposed to. I didn't give it one star because it isn't horrible.	-1
I was really excited to try this product because of all the good reviews on it, but I was really disappointed. I get horribly dry lips if I'm not careful enough and I read on sites and heard tons of great reviews for this product. Now, this may just be from the color of the Guava flavor, but when I applied it to my lips it made them look even drier. However the product itself, ignoring the color, did not improve my chapped lips at all. I'm still trying to use it and see if it works better on lips that aren't dry, but so far I'm having the same issue.  I wouldn't totally dismiss the idea of it, however. I may try it in another color to see if it was just the pale one that made my flaky lips stand out.	-1
This is a nice little moisturizer for the lips.  A nice little hint of color.  I was happy with my purchase.	1
I will buy this product again. the color is great and it feels so good. will try other colors next time	1
This stuff is amazing! Who knew this kind of coverage was available?! Don't be put off by the small size of the tube. It takes the tinyest amount to do the job. A fingertip is far too big for applying this under eyes, for instance. Experiment and see. I use a Q-tip with just a smidge on it, for BOTH eyes!	1
Best concealer out there.	1
love it	1
good	1
This is my new favorite toothpaste. I suffer from dry mouth from medication. Normal toothpaste makes my mouth so dry and dry mouth toothpaste tastes horrible. I love the way Ginger Mint tastes and I love the way it makes my mouth feel. I also got Cinnamon Mint but I definitely like this one better!	1
good toothpaste but way more mint than ginger flavored.  That was a little disappointing, as the other Marvis flavors I have tried aren't that way - especially jasmine mint which is much more jasmine-y.  Was looking for more ginger flavor - but Marvis is still a great product and even though it's more of a fun novelty product for my household, it gives you a clean tasting mouth and performs well (hence 4 stars).	1
i wish it was more ginger, less minty. super clean feeling after use.	1
great product on my skin	1
Ive been using this product for almost 10 years and this batch has no expiration date and has a different fragrance	-1
love Jan Marini  products , Transformation is my favorite cream , and eye cream too . absorbs beautifully , and skin is supple and not oily , I can't be without the eye cream.	1
I was skeptical about this cream, even though I had read many good reviews.  After 2 weeks of use, my skin was transformed.  Nothing magical, but it evened out my skin tone, my huge pores look slightly smaller, & my skin looks more plump w/a nice glow.  It isn't greasy, which I really like.  Most creams are very greasy.  I have sensitive skin w/slight rosacea on my cheeks & this, I believe, has improved it.  No sensitivity either, like most skin care products.  I was using Kinerase for over 15 years,....but this works just as well, if not better, @ almost 1/2 the price.	1
I have been using Jan Marini Transformation Cream for about 5 years now, as recommended by my aesthetician. It is truly a product that rejuvenates the skin and makes my skin look younger and gives it a fresher, more "glowing" appearance. I gets lots of compliments on my skin and I feel that Jan Marini is one of the reasons. It's worth every penny. I no longer waste my money on department store cosmetics that do nothing to stimulate the collagen, etc. Jan Marini gives proven results!	1
i have used this for over 20 years. It is not sticky or oily. AND it is spf 33!!  I use it every morning	1
It made me break out, especially my chin area .  To be fair though, I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.  However, I do recommend their Bioglycolic cleanser which really helps to exfoliate.	-1
Great product.	-1
I have been using this product since 1995 and am very satisfied with its non-greasy feel and the SPF factor.	1
Doubtful of authenticity think it's fake	-1
Wouldn't be without this product	1
Only facial SPF I use. This stuff works great and was recommended to me years ago after receiving a facial. Fast shipping and perfectly described by seller.	1
The sunscreen seems authentic, unlike other JM items I have purchased through Amazon.	1
Awesome product! Have been using for years. Like that it doesn't have that sunscreen scent.	1
This is great product and smells really nice. I use it every day as part of my cleaning regimen. I have fair skin and it really works for me.	1
This isn't your "normal" SPF. It moisturizes while it protects. I wouldn't be without it. Best I've ever used, period.	1
It's a staple in my moisturizing regime. It's smooth and doesn't leave any oily residue. It's a terrific product that my facialist turned me on to. So glad she did!	1
I have been using this product since 1995. It is the first thing I put on my face every morning and some days it is the only thing. It never feels greasy and is a great sun protectant.	1
I have tried many different face products, but by far this one is the best.  I continue to purchase it, as it not only hydrates the skin, but protects it from the sun.  I would highly recommend this product.	1
I use this under clear coat to still have the appearance of natural nails but with a more polished clean look. It could be worn alone but it would be a mat finish.	1
I used this as an undercoat to one of their polishes the other day, and I was really impressed with the finish it left as a base coat.  The color is so neutral and nice that you could actually just do this with a clear top coat to let your natural nails stand out a bit.  But as an undercoat, it really did even my nails out and give a flawless base for color.  You can't go wrong with this.	1
This is a terrific product.  It has kept my nails long all winter.  I had given up using nail polish until I found Butter London.	1
Just fabulous as are all  the Butter London Products I have purchased. Great base for polish and very interesting if you just want a sheer,clear coat.	1
Works great with any type of nail color	1
excellent! I like it	1
I recently purchased an array of Butter LONDON products. I think this basecoat is my favorite. It has a great consistancy, doesn't smell too strong, dries fast and has a nice tint and almost a matte finish.  I have taken to wearing it alone because it is the perfect nude for my skin.  Also, it seems to be a great base for my polish.	1
Great base coat and it is beautiful on it's own under a layer of top coat. Goes on well and dries quickly. It is VERY matte. I love it and use it first for french manicures, then white tips (cotton white) then top coat.	1
When I don't want to put a colored nail polish on, I go for this. It smooths out my nails and looks very natural. I love using it as a base coat too.	1
This may be a pricey item, but after purchasing it 12 months ago and using it once a week every week, there is about a half bottle of product left.  In the bottle it looks a little darker nude than it is when applied. This is a fast drying product but wait about 10 minutes for the surface to become really hard, then you have a good base for 2 coats of nail polish (wait 10 min between each) and finally (after 10 min) apply Butter London Top Coat.  The base coat and top coat can be purchased in a set on Amazon--good idea.  I use this with China Glaze, OPI, Orly and Butter London with wonderful results--smooth, long lasting and professional looking results.	1
I knew that this product would not be without some tingling due to the acid, but I found it very uncomfortable. Also I did not find it very effective as well as it left my cuticles even drier than they were before.	-1
I had to apply this a few times to my nails in order for the cuticle to be reduced. The cuticles are not as neat as when going to a salon but if you're in a pinch, this works great.	1
I purchased this product when I read a review on Amazon.com.  Well, I do not find it as amazing as the reviewer did.  I hardly use it now.  I love the Butter London products, but this is not my favorite.	-1
Nice top coat for a smooth shiny finish. Seems to last well. I got it a little cheeper on Amazon then at the department store.	1
This top coat is incredibly durable!  Just one coat has protected my nails from all kinds of abuse.  I have a big dog, garden, and cook, and so am very active with my hands.  This top layer wasn't even scratched after digging in the dirt to do some planting.  I'm mighty impressed and would recommend this to anyone.	1
I love this product.  It is safe to use and lasts all week long.	1
Butter London rocks even if they DO NOT have a thinner!  This makes one's BL nail polish last even longer!	1
Works great with any brand of nail color.	1
does a great job	1
I really do like this brand a lot. And I find with their colors that you definitely need a good top coat so the polish does not chip and I don't have to re-do the color during the week.	1
Pretty goog topcoat~ Haven't really have the time to test how long it lasts but I put it on with a cheap color and old base coat for 3days and it didn't chip~	1
It really does dry your nails quickly, without bubbles or ridges. Combined with the Butter nail polishes, this is perfect. My manicure lasts all week.	1
This is a great top coat. It goes on smoothly and it dries quickly. I love it and use it often	1
This is really nice top coat! Dries fast and helps nails stay perfect for a couple days. I would recommend putting on a 2nd coat day 2.	1
This is the best topcoat.  It really does seal in the polish.  I find that if I use the Butter polish alone it chips within two days, but with this topcoat it won't chip for at least a week. It dries quickly and has a great sheen.  This is a wonderful investment.	1
This item is a little pricey but well worth it.  I purchased it about 12 months ago, and after using it once a week every week, there is at least half a bottle of product left.  I use with China Glaze, OPI, Orly and Butter London polishes. Every manicure is a success, long lasting and smooth coverage.  Wait about 10 minutes between applications of base coat (Butter London), 2 applications of nail polish, then top coat.  Wonderful results!	1
I'm not ordinarily a fan of dark polishes, but Chimney Sweep is a lovely color.  In some lights it has a green hue, in others it looks somewhat blue.  I love Butter London!!	1
This is a lovely crushed-glitter red.  Good for celebrating!  I found myself just gazing at my nails after I applied it.  Gorgeous!  (Just don't wear base coat or it's nearly impossible to remove.)	1
Lovely color!!	1
Favorite brand. It is shiny and smooth and rarely chips. I can garden, do dishes and no chips. I also wear the come to bed red color and it doesn't stain my nails. I only use this, no top or bottom coat.	1
love this nail polish.  The color was just like it was suppose to be.  I bought the Poole color.  I just put it on tonight, so not sure how long it will stay on, but even it is just a week I will be happy with it.  I think it really depends on what top coat you put on anyway.  So pretty.  I will buy again, and recommend.	1
Love this color but pricey	1
Purple is my favorite color. This rocks :-)	1
Nice polish, high quality.  Be advised that the color is very "quiet" and unassuming, a perfect neutral.  The gold flecks add gloss, but you can't see them on their own.	1
I have purchased "seaside". The nail polish goes on opaque in 2 coast. I use the base and a top. I get a lot of compliments all the time!!! The nail polish lasts a long time and I do a lot with my hands as a stay at home mom. I have 2 small kids and wash my hands constantly. This picture was taken on day 5 on me wearing it. As you can see it looks like I just painted them!!! Highly recommend.	1
Wow! Beautiful color. Deep color but with a sheen that shows more than just a simple violet color. So worth the crazy $15 for nail color. I won't use the many nail color brands with all the un-healthy cooties in most products. What is that about? Why risk more chemicals that darn sure can't be good to put on your body. Not with a beautiful alternative.	1
Excellent	1
I love it! Very easy to apply! Quick dry!	1
Great line of polishes with less toxicity. Pretty colors. Good wearability.	1
love the color. got many compliments. goes on smooth	1
love the color	1
Very pretty.	1
It was the first nail polish that dried quickly and didn't smear as others have. I'll buy it again.	1
Beautiful shade.. between blue and periwinkle. Perfect and long lasting. I use their system...base... topcoat nd color. Yippee. Very nice quality	1
Got tons of compliments on this polish.  I wear it on my toes and the 2 coats that I used has held up for 2 weeks beautifully.  I also paired with Butter base coat and top coat.  I've had multiple people comment that they think the color should be called, robin's egg blue:)	1
One coat of this polish covers the nail wonderfully.  I did have some chipping after a couple days but my profession requires tons of hand washing and also glove wearing so I wasn't surprised or disappointed.  The only way I can polish to last for a week is with a shellac type manicure.  Wonderful color and went on nicely.  I paired with Butter base and top coat.	1
This polish is a bright true orange with the perfect balance of red and yellow.  It is a classic summer shade and looks very nice either for a manicure or pedicure.  The first coat went on rather streaky and the second was a little less so, but still not perfect.  So I ended up having to do three coats (in addition to a base coat).  I did use a quick dry top coat but it still took a full 30 minutes before I felt free to resume normal movement, lol!  This brand of polish wears pretty well.  It's been 5 days since my manicure and I only have some minimal wear on the tips, but no chips.  I was lucky enough to purchase this color at TJ Maxx for $5, a true bargain.  I have other Butter London polishes I have paid full price for, so I was happy to find it so cheaply.  I know that this formula is free of a number of traditional nail polish chemicals, and that's fine, as long as it doesn't effect the hardiness of the polish in general.  I have no issues with the health of my nails, and I wear them short and neat, so I'm not too terribly concerned about it. I have an extensive nail polish collection but didn't have a bright true orange so I'm glad I was able to pick this one up.  It looks great with summer clothing.  I'm giving this polish four stars because the first two coats were so streaky.  But by the third coat, the look was smooth and shiny and in general, the polish has worn well.  I definitely recommend this color and Butter London in general.  However, if you're not concerned about the chemical factor, Essie polish wears just as well for half the price.	1
I didn't think I would HATE a polish, but I do.  It streaked terribly when I was applying it and though the color is gorgeous in the bottle, it is not pretty on.  It looked thick and it chipped quickly.  I have several other butter London polishes and I love them so I am incredibly disappointed in Goss.	-1
Champers is a lovely bronze with little flecks (minuscule confetti flecks) of glitter, subtle but very pretty the way it dances in the light.  I would say it is flattering to most skin tones and it goes on well/ wears well- unlike the butter London metallic polish I tried that didn't have any glitter.  It was beyond awful- streaked, looked horrid on and chipped quickly.  I also have All Hail the Queen- a metallic with the shimmer and it goes on brilliantly and wears well.  My lesson in butter metallics is to only go for those with shimmer.	1
I really should have gone to the store rather than trusting how colors would translate from online to in person.  Since I'm a fan of butter London, it seemed like a safe gamble.  Wow was I wrong.  The color Dahling (such a fun name, like all their colors) looks *nothing* like the photo.  I thought it was going to be a delicious medium sherberty pink and it's actually rather dowdy,  a matronly mauvey pink.  Sad.	-1
Accurate color in photo.	1
Very disappointed. It may be 7-free but it's rated a "6" on EWG. Ugh! I was going to go back to Essie (rated a 5 with EWG Skin Deep) but will try Zoya (5-free) because of all the good things I read about it. It was 1 of only 2 out of the 12 nail polishes tested that were really free of the toxic chemicals they claimed.	-1

This polish goes on smooth, dries in minutes and keeps a manicure longer than using regular polish (for me one week).	1
People just keep giving me compliments, and I'm not going to lie...I love it.	1

This review is for "The Old Bill."  On my nails, it's a light, shiny copper color (but muted compared to actual copper metal).  It went on smoothly although I did need to use three coats to get it to be opaque (which means you might be able to do some interesting things with layering over other colors).  I didn't use a base coat and used a Seche Vite quick dry topcoat.  I was surprised to find that this polish was 5-free.  Usually 3- or 5-free polishes shrink a lot on my nails, especially at the edges.  But this one hasn't shrunk.  And at day 2, I don't have any chips yet.  (I'm hard on my hands and most polishes have chipped at least a little by now.)  I'm definitely a fan of this polish.  The performance has been so good that I'd even consider buying more colors from the same brand -- even though this is expensive, as nail polishes go.	1
Nothing like butter LONDON nail lacquer.  I found that Rosie Lee did not work well with my salon gel manicure.	1
love	1
love this new color!	1
These polishes are expensive and too thin for the color to pop. I bought several because the colors are so beautiful but have returned to old faithful OPI.	-1
First time trying a butter london nail polish personally, and I LOVE IT. It dries super quick so you have to make sure you have perfected it the first time around. It also feels different to me then a regular nail polish. The application process takes time to learn but I absolutely love it and this color is GORGEOUS!	1
Like all butter LONDON Nail Lacquer, Fruit Machine is GORGOUS! The color is soft, classy, & goes on in 2 coats.	1
Primrose Hill Picnic is an irresistible, luscious, vibrant pink that makes me feel happy when I look at it. Not quite neon, but close - with a perfect mellowed edge.  I am love with this color and. I am here to buy another bottle so I won't be without this new, favorite, "go-to" color.  Two coats make perfect! Love in a bottle.	1
Only one complaint about this nail polish.  It doesn't last long on my finger nails.  The color is lovely, and is longer lasting on my toe nails.	1
After seeing British Racing Green swatched all over the Internet, I finally gave in and bought it. Unfortunately, for me it's been the same story s with a lot of other very dark colours: out of bright light, it just looks like black. I found it really annoying that once I'd put on enough to reach a good opacity, you really couldn't tell it was green. Since then, this expensive product has just sat in my drawers. I can't recommend this colour, but Butter London's Come to Bed Red is a staple for my nails. It's great!	-1
I'm Caucasian and pretty white, but for some reason, a lot of red nail polishes have just made my hands look kind of dirty and unappealing. Another problem I've often had with them is that they end up looking brownish instead of properly red. Come to Bed Red is different. To me, its the perfect red, a true red that isn't pink, isn't Brown, and isn't neon. I get a lot of compliments on my long, natural nails and part of how I keep them from getting damaged is to apply many layers of this, which creates a thick finish that is surprisingly durable, often lasting several days with little to no tip wear and zero chipping. One complaint I have is that I've found BL polishes take a very long time to dry, but the fact that the polish is thick and that I apply many layers overall probably worsens that. Also, it's frustrating that it seems to get thicker as you use the bottle up. Even so, I love it and repurchase again and again in this colour.	1
Best nail polish on the market today. Goes on easy and smooth with no streaking. Drys fast. With the medium to dark colors, only one coat of polish is needed. Highly recommend!	1
The glitter is exact and too much so, one looks as if one has sparkly fungi on one's nails.  There are better.	-1
Hideous.  Butter London is a high quality lacquer but every once in a while the colours are not true.  This is an example of a lacquer gone bad.	-1
Lovely color and formula! It also got to my location really quickly. Definitely a must have in your collection. :)	1
I really like butter London polish first thing I want to mention that this color does not look like the picture I am looking at as I write this review .This is a teal color and if you like teal you will love this I was not disappointed at all because I like teal. This goes on so easy I used a base coat than two coats of the polish and a top coat and wow the color really stuck out. I like this brand because it is a 3 free meaning noFormaldehyde,no Toluene and no DBP I have used this brand before with great results I do recommend a top coat so it will last longer on your nails .Also the seller is a great seller arrived fast and packaged perfect.	1
This stuff does not chip!!!  It's a beautiful pearly blue that's easy to put on and stays on - love it!	1
WOW! Absolutely love it! Color is exquisite! Glided on like butter indeed - no smearing or cleaning required after application and I m not a pro at this thing! Very long lasting! Shipping was fast!	1
Butter London is the best nail polish in the marketplace! Goes on very easy and smooth, no streaks ever. Most times no second coat is needed, especially with the darker colors. I won't purchase any other brand of nail polish. Worth the price!! Manicure lasts for 7 days!	1
I think Butter London is the best nail polish. The colors are beautiful. It goes on well, easy, and smooth, and most times 1 coat is all you need, especially the darker colors. Well worth the money. Highest recommendations.	1
This is my favorite blue nail polish. It's the perfect tint of a light grey blue and the sparkles in it really make the color pop. It's a perfect color for any time of the year also. Very versatile!	1
Like my title reflects, I use this nail polish for the white tips of my French manicures. I love it and it works perfectly. I do Butter basecoat, then this white, then Butter top coat and it's perfect	1
Great neutral color.  I think it would look good on most skin tones. One in the set of Oprah's Favorite Things 2013.	1
I love Butter London colors.  I have had chipping issues in the past with Butter London but now I use the Revlon gel base coat and that is no longer an issue.	1
Butter London has once again met and exceeded all my expectations. This polish color is just as vibrant as it appears. Butter London's colors are always rich and beautiful in person. All what I really love about their nail polish is the fact that is doesn't have any of the horrible smells that many of the other brands have because they cut out those chemicals. The polish doesn't destroy the nail like many other products and is always easy to remove and applies smoothly and thickly. Two coats is perfect. If you haven't tried their polish before I highly recommend it!	1

All Hail the Queen was my first bottle of polish by Butter London. Tired of thin polishes from Essie and not really excited by OPI at the moment, I finally decided to give this brand a try. I've purchased a bottle of Chanel polish before, but $15 for nail color still seems steep to me. I picked this color because it seemed safe lol and I just wanted to try the product line.  I really do like the color. Having brown skin it's not exactly nude but a nice neutral color with a hint of sparkle to break up the monotony. The application reminded me a lot of the Chanel bottle I have. Not just the removable top cover, but the fact that it brushes on neatly. You won't end up with too much on the brush, minimizing clean up and product waste.  The color itself is nice and with a top coat it reminds me a little of those old Sally Hansen prism polishes, minus the color change effect. I do like the texture of the polish and it's wearable with or without a topcoat. This color can also be worn well at one or two coats. The drying time was fast, but I can't speak too much for the longevity yet. I see complaints about chipping polish, which may be solved by making sure your nails are smooth, well buffed and totally clean of all oils. After a day of wear, shampooing my hair etc my polish was still intact, at least. (I used Out the Door topcoat)  I'm not saying I'm a Butter London fan just yet lol, but I did like this polish enough to order a second color. When I saw my polish outdoors the next day, I ordered 3 more bottles of Butter London polish from Amazon lol. While I'm sure other companies out there make a color comparable to this one, I'm happy I finally gave this brand a try.	1
The color is really beautiful and the pearlescence catches the light very well.  I like every Butter London polish I've tried, but this one is my favorite.	1
Love this nail polish.  was impressed it didn't have the bad stuff.  In fact,  I recently found out their nail lacquers are formulated without carcinogens.  I guess in the US we allow it but in the UK they don't. The polish color is true to what's in the bottle and it lasts long.  I would say it lasts about 5 days which is two days longer than what I usually wear.  This Royal Navy color looks amazing on your fingernails and on your toes.	1
This is a beautiful dark green.  You'll need 2 coats but its worth it.  It's an unusual color of green, one you don't see anywhere else.	1
You can't go wrong with Butter and this is a very pretty dark purple.  I've never experienced any trouble with chipping with the Butter polishes and I would definitely recommend them to everyone.  Even though they are pricey, they don't contain the harmful chemicals other polishes do, they go on smoothly and you won't find more unique and pretty colors	1
You can't go wrong with butter and this is a nice combo of red/pink.  It's works against almost any skin tone without being too pink or harsh	1
I love Butter so I'm biased but this is a very pretty color.  If you're looking to round out your butter collection, you should have this color.  It does take numerous coats though if you use it by itself	1
With just a hint of shimmer to jazz it up a bit. Love the color and love this brand - it has really staying power, much longer than most brands of polish.	1
Love the shade; it glides on and has major staying power.  Maybe not the equivalent of a gel but I had no chips after 8 days and that's a record for me.	1
This color is a beautiful teal/blue. It a a subtle color that would work well with any skin tone.  It looks great by itself  or you can add a coat of Butter's Tart with a Heart for an extra sparkle.  I highly recommend this color	1
This is a pretty polish as all Butter colors are.  It's perfect is you're wanting a color that's dark with sparkles but don't want to do black.	1
I was so excited to pick out my very first bottle of Butter 3-free nail polish. There were many gorgeous colors to choose from. I chose this one (Kerfuffle)...and I wish I hadn't. It didn't go on very nicely. It was obvious I couldn't even possibly get by temporarily with one coat. But mostly it reminds me of a colored "White-Out" I used years ago at my job. Every time I look down at my toes, I cringe because it's obvious I won't be happy until I remove it and put something else on.  I would be willing to try another color by this brand, but I can't recommend this one.	-1
This polish seemed to be very long lasting, I went 2 weeks without it chipping. The color is beautifully vibrant & I got a lot of compliments on it. I love Butter London nail products in general, but this one is one of my favorites!	1
My first bottle of butter LONDON nail polish is a gorgeous mauve-pink shade with pearlescent/metallic overtones.  The bottle wouldn't open until I saw that it was sealed with a special sticker and you have to pull off the cute rectangular top to get at the real top that unscrews to reveal the brush.  Clever!  Also no leaks.  The polish goes on like the name states, like butter.  I used O.P.I. Natural Nail Base Coat, then two coats of the polish, topped off by O.P.I. Rapid Dry Top Coat.  Because the butter LONDON polish self-levels very nicely, a rather quickly-done manicure looks like a much more professional job.  The long, specially shaped brush for the polish worked really well to apply it.  I definitely will be trying more shades of butter London!	1
I still am a big fan of OPI; the consistency, the color choices. However, I love the Butter colors and the way they slide on your nails. At the end of the week, my manicure still looked great. This is a quality polish. I am partial to the browns/mauves; Yummy Mummy and All Hail the Queen are surely my colors.	1
I just used this polish for my manicure. Everyone loved it at the salon. I am getting so many compliments! This shade just might work all year long. There is a beautiful shimmer to it as well. A perfect mauve-brown shade!	1
This is the first time I have used this polish and really like it .would buy again stays on long	1
I wore this color with butter LONDON's Stag Do and they went well together. This color has a shimmer/rainbow effect once it is on your nails and is just gorgeous. It is more of a sheer color, but I feel it's very summery. I would highly recommend purchasing this color.	1
I wore this color as an accent to butter LONDON's Hen Party. The polish covers the nail really well and stays on without chipping for a good amount of time. In my opinion it is worth the price you have to pay.	1
I bought this brand of polish because of the healthier ingredients. I also bought the base and top coats by Butter London ($29.99 for both) and followed exact instructions. I used a base coat, 2 coats of polish and top coat. Less than 24 hours later, it's chipped dramatically all over. Unfortunately, I can't return these products because of Amazon's return policy of hazardous materials i.e. nail polish.	-1
I just love love love Butter London polish... the quality is wonderful and the colors are so vibrant! Goes on with ease!	1
This color looks great on and stays on! Strong nail polish that lasts much longer and less chipping then other competitive brands.	1
This is a great color.  It mimics the natural raspberry color when on the nails.  I think this is a great color for spring.  It is appropriate for work or play and would even look nice while in a formal evening gown.  I particularly like Butter London nail polishes because they are free of most contaminates.  I feel that they also make my nails healthier.  I would recommend this color to everyone.	1
This is exactly as described.  I love Butter nail polishes because I find them to be much better for my nail health and it makes me feel better that it does not contain carcinogens.  This color is very versatile and works with any skin color. I think this is a great purchase and is a wonderful addition to any collection.	1
I like this one! it's really thick for a glitter and I just wore it alone. loosk great with 4 coats.	1
Love this color and this brand. Wish it was in a lippy form. Arrived very fast from seller and very pleased with Butter London nail products.	1
This is a really beautiful color. It's very metallic. It looks shear, but there's a lot of shine and sparkle in it. I highly recommend. Love this brand, too! I always get great colors.	1
This color is very pretty. It's very bright yellow. I love the Butter London brand already - great hues, love the brush and it last a long time. I highly recommend this polish if you're looking for something bright and cheery.	1
Be sure to buy this nail lacquer from Butter London and NOT from Shop Adorn!!  Butter London is a quality product, but Shop Adorn sent me old, thick, streaky BL nail lacquer.	1
See description above. The London Butter nail lacquer that I purchased from their company is 100% fantastic!!  But, the London Butter nail lacquer that I purchased  from Shop Adorn was disgusting!!	-1
The butter London brand lacquer has turned me into such a polish snob. I can tell a huge difference in this brand of polish from the cheaper department store/drug store brands. I love this shade of pink, it's not hot pink but not a baby pink either.	1
I've read the other reviewers' comments, and all are 'correct' however, here are a few things one needs to know before purchasing. If you thought this would look like the bottle all by itself, with a standard one or two coats, you'll be disappointed.  This polish is best used with other colors, or if alone, more than two coats.  yes the polish dries rough, and somewhat matte, to fix this use their top coat and the colors will also look much more intense. Also, I believe this polish was intended to be a topper, or an added dimension to an under coat of color, either holgraphic/opaque glimmer, or cream color.  If used on top of a pale pink, and topped with a gloss, the effect is girly to the max,,, also, depends on how many coats one uses.  top a red and you'll get more gold...  If used alone, over a standard base coat, try building up till the color intensity suits your look.  this could be three or four. While matte looks are a statement, the rougness makes using it that way less appealing.  This polish 'looks' like it would be glossy, but it's not, not by itself.  This can happen with almost any of the polishes that have actual glitter in them.  All in all this is a very versatile, flexible polish to have in your bag of nail tricks. the key is to get creative and have fun with it.	1
This Butter brand polish has added to my collection from this brand. The colours (and monikers) are great. The less toxic ingredients are an added bonus!	1
Another hit colour from the butter brand of nail polish! I bought this one as a gift and will now likely purchase for myself!	1
This polish, as with many glitter polishes, should be used over a base coat of a French pink shade. The color is slightly pink of the lacquer itself while the glitter is a light shade of gold. This item matched very well the stock photo and I am very pleased with this shade, and the butter London nail polish line	1
I loved the color of this nail polish when I first bought it.  However, after applying two coats it was a disastrous mess.  The ending result was thick, streaky and looked as if I applied 5 coats.  When dried it was so unattractive, it had to be removed straight away.  Not worth $14.00!	-1
This is an awesome nail polish. It is as good as chanel nail polish but half the price. I used it with orly brand top coat and so far it has been two days and no chipping. It went on smoothly and dried fast. It is pricey but worth it.	1
This is the best nail polish out there.  Period.  It is free of chemicals, wears really well and has really cool colors.  What else can I say?  The only nail polish i will buy.	1
This color is so vivid, it only needs just one coat and glossy top coat to emphasize it. Color seems to appear a bit darker on nails than it looks on the product picture, but it's still vivid. I 'm pretty much neutral girl when it comes to nail polish, but this was a nice and fun experience having this vibrant color on my finger tips. Highly recomended!!	1
I bought three different colors of this dreamy looking nail polish and used them as stocking stuffers (including my own!)  The sheen is lovely, but the polish chips easily, and can't be worn without a topcoat, as even two coats won't stand up to normal wear and tear for even a day.	-1
this color is just fantastic!!!  it is just the right shadw of dark blue to dress up or down.....Love it!!!	1
love butter polish....this color was just a bit light for me.........has shimmer to it but is light even with 2 coats.	1
So I had finally bought some butter londons. I avoided it because I just couldn't get over the price. However, I liked one of the colors very much and decided to give them a shot because their shape is a bit easier to store. So, I bought a set/kit thing and a 3 different colors.  One of the colors of the butters I didn't like that much against my skin, so, I decided because I loved the bottle so much (this is awful don't judge me) I poured out the color (I knew I would never use a color that didn't match my skin, and couldn't find someone else who wanted it either) and poured one of my OPI's into the empty butter bottle.  I noticed in this process of pouring out that the consistency of the butter london is MUCH thicker than OPI and even though the oz in the bottle is less than in the OPI bottle it seemed to take forever to pour out. I actually started to think the OPI seemed cheap by how quickly it poured out... Which I have NEVER thought before!  In the kit there was a cuticle oil, a clear top coat, a flesh color, and a nail polish remover. The remover at first smells like any other remover but once that initial smell went away it made my hands smell like roses. It was wonderful!! The cuticle oil smells very good as well and the top coat is awesome. In case you haven't seen one in a store, the top black part actually pops off which I thought was kind of strange but I don't mind it. Once the top pops off you have a lid to twist to open the bottle. I think its just for design which I like because it makes for clean storage because of the solid rectangular shape.  I beat up my hands (I'm an artist and a cook and I work constructing sets sometimes) So, my hands get BEAT UP. This nail polish really lasts. I will say it does this weird thing where it crackles in a way that doesn't chip the polish which is great even though looks a little funny. That took a long time to happen though.  I officially have been converted to Butter London, however, they lack a lot of colors. So, when they come out with more I will investigate. I completely recommend this brand if you are able to spare the cost for the quality.	1
I love this eye cream. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin and feels like satiny, silly sheets for your eyes. Great for everyday use and to use in combo with the Cellufirm Drops.	1
Was hoping this was gonna be great but was let down   this eye cream was really hard for my skin to absorb and then it dried out my eye area so much my skin started to get irritated and flake off  don't bother trying it youall just waste $ and regret it. I have a whole jar left so maybe Ill try using this as a neck cream ...	-1
I have very sensitive skin and this gives me a reaction, but other than that makes my skin look great	1
Very nice product!	1
This eye cream has helped the bags under my eyes so much! I apply every night before bed. Love this stuff! It is thick thats why I use it at night.	1
Love this stuff!! Wish I would have found this year's ago ...it would have saved me tons of money !!!	1
A little goes a long, long way. I really love this product, in particular, and the Mario Badescu line, in general.	1
I came across "Mario Badescu" at ULTA one day at the checkout area. I picked up the rose water/aloe facial spray and fell in love. I researched the product more and chose this cream (hoping it would help my rapidly aging eye region!) Within the first few days I noticed a drastic change and decline in dryness; also in my fine lines and beginning crows feet around my eyes. Although it does not seem to be helping my dark under eye circles. It is also a little thick, so I recommend applying a thin layer 10-15min before makeup application. I am a makeup artist and WOULD absolutely use and refer this product to my clients	1
Lightweight and goes on smooth. Makes my dark under eyes look refreshed and the skin appears smoother. Love it!	1
This cream is a god-sent! Before trying this cream I had tried sooooo many others to combat my dry under eyes. I can't even imagine how much money I've spent on different creams and oils to try to combat my issue. Thank God my search is over because this is now my 2nd time purchasing this eye cream and I'm hooked! I will definitely purchase this again and again and again and again...you get the point.	1
40 years old and still get mistaken for a 20 something...i'd say this works!!!	1
I have had good luck with all the products I have bought from the Mario Badescu line. The texture is great and it hydrates the area around the eyes. I would recommend this product.	1
I love this product! It is hydrating and fabulous! Great seller too!	1
I have tried many eye creams. I got a sample of this from Nordstrom and loved it. The price is unbeatable and makes my concealer go on so smoothly. No more $60 plus eye creams this one is perfect and priced right.	1
Despite the small size, this product lasts for a long time because a little of it goes a very long way. I find that it sinks in very quickly too, which is nice in the morning for under concealer. But I don't find that this product has any noticeable different on my under eye area.	-1
love this stuff.  I have sensitive skin and it did not bother me. goes on smoothly and does not feel goopy or greasy.  it is light and good for under makeup. good stuff and not too expensive . recommended.	1
nothing special- don"t notice any improvement or change- but less expensive than most other eye creams and Hyaluronic acid is an excellent skin plumper	1
I'll be darned .. it really works.  Dark circles (decades old) are diminished, all but gone!  And fast .. it's remarkable.	1
Smells great, leaves a very subtle shimmer.	1
I LOVE this product. I had been searching for a face wash to suit my rosacea skin but nothing quite hit the mark. During a visit to New York, I visited the Mario Badescu store and had a consultation with one of the specialists there. She immediately identified my rosacea and associates cuperose and recommended this face wash. I  and after a consultation at	1
Exfoliation fixes it all -- it helps my pores appear smaller, it improves skin texture, it keeps my skin clearer and softer... BUT when you're a red-faced Irish girl like me, you can't use harsh exfoliants on your face.  With other cleansers, my face would get red.  And stay red all day!  This cleanser is creamy and non-irritating, but it really does slough off the junky top layer of skin.  It's truly magical.  I'd buy stock in it if I could.  Also, if you care about these things (and I do), Badescu products are cruelty free.	1
My favorite toner around! I have sensitive and dry skin. My skin has never looked healthier! I use this every night. My husband never noticed anything beauty-wise and he complimented me on how great my skin looks! It felt really good because I wasn't sure if I was the only one that noticed because I wanted to like it so much or if it was really working.	1
I love the smell, it leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft!	1
Has a slightly "old lady" smell to it. Other than that, it does a good job.	1
One of my recent samples has been Mario Badescu Skin Care Products. I started off with the Almond and Honey Face Scrub which was a pretty gentle scrub. It smells AWESOME, I am a big fan of the sweet almond scent! I give this scent 5 stars :-) I scrubbed it onto my moistened face and rinsed it off, it left my skin feeling very clean and soft. I then applied some of the Seaweed Cleansing Lotion (toner) it smelled pretty plain and earthy. The Seaweed scent was just ok, but it left my skin feeling clean and tight. Next I applied a small amount of the Ceramide Herbal Eye Cream. It smells like a non-scented lotion. This was just ok. I then massaged the Hyaluronic Moisturizer (SPF 15) into my face and neck which also smells like a non-scented lotion. It went on light, its not really thick, which I liked. Out of all these products I loved the Almond and Honey Scrub & the rest of the products were just ok.	1
Great Night Cream!	1
On my second jar of this!  It's not too heavy like a lot of night creams are and rubs in smoothly without leaving my skin feeling greasy.	1
it was a gift and there are no complaints	1
Great prod	1
This mask smells really bad but it works really well.  I use it once a week.	1
It does an excellent job of improving completion and temporarily shrinking pores to slow oil production.	1
I've recently switched over to Mario Badescu everything for my skin care regime and every single thing works. I've tried forever to get rid of my adult acne so I'm glad I finally found something. I live in the desert so it's difficult to find something that doesn't dry my skin but this surprisingly doesn't dry it out. I use it twice a week and follow with the healing mask to keep my skin from drying too much.	1
Love this brand and this Tiber is amazing. I have dry skin and this doesn't dry out my skin!	1
good	1
I don't know how it would work as a makeup removes, but on makeup-free skin it works LIKE A CHARM. I previously used MB's Acne Cleanser since I have an oily t-zone and hormonal acne on my chin but this is just... better, more balanced, less stripping. Mario's top product.	1
I love Mario Badescu products! I have combination skin and use this on particularly oily days. Very nice, gentle and a little goes a long way.	1
This is a drugstore quality cream. Does nothing, not particularly moisturizing. Cheap packaging.	-1
Awesome night cream. Light and refreshing.	1
A new favorite - awesome for sensitive skin. I rotate Mario Badescu Seaweed cleanser and lotion with Mario Badescu Chamomile Cleanser and lotion daily (Seaweed in the a.m. and Chamomile in the p.m.) and use Mario Badescu Chamomile night cream. This approach is so soothing for my middle-aged skin that is prone to redness (the redness has reduced dramatically).	1
This simple toner has about 6-7 ingredients in it. That's it! Seaweed is excellent for your skin, and this soothing cleanser makes my face feel like a million bucks after I put it on. I use it as a follow up to the glycolic cleanser and it's a great combo. My skin looks fabulous and the smell is comforting (it's a bit powdery, which I'm not sure where this comes from since there's no 'parfum' or 'fragrance' listed in the ingredients). Highly recommend.	1
I have this awful skin condition - Lichen Planus - from ruptured silicone breast implants (ladies beware), and this mask soothes it like no other.  In fact, I sleep in it at least 3 times a week.  It has a great texture and dries completely so that it won't smudge off on my pillow etc.  When I'm having a skin flare up this really calms the redness down.  The next morning after I've slept in it all night my face is much less red and swollen.  I will keep this mask as a part of my regular skin healing regime.  Mario has the best products!  I think I have almost all of them :)	1
like it	1
It is useful as it described.	1
Not much to say, since it is just a face wash. I can't blame it solely for my face clearing up resently. However, I am using an acne medicine that has over dried my face, and this has been a real life saver! It doesn't dry out my skin more, and leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean.  I use this as a night time face wash. So I first use a makeup wipe ( mostly just for my eye makeup so it doesn't get in my eyes) then I wash my face with this.	1
This is the only cleanser that my wife will use. Mario Badescu is a great brand and well worth the price that you pay. This works miracles and my wife swears by this brand. This is highly reccomend this brand!	1
I like this brand, but not this particular cream.  It didn't really absorb into my skin, but just sat on top of it feeling greasy ... while at the same time leaving my skin feeling dry.  I had to blend it with some argan oil to keep my skin from feeling dry.	-1
Very happy it doesn't smell like seaweed! I look forward to putting this on my face all day long	1
Love this! Love all his products. Watch YouTube if you want to hear in depth reviews.	1
Good product.  I am pleased and will purchase again.	1
This really helps moisturize under the eyes and smooths out tiny wrinkles and it lasts a lond time as yoiu don't use that much of it.	1
Expected more.  Irritated my skin.  Smelled chemically.	-1
Highly recommended	1
My skin has multiple personalities.  It's oily, sensitive, gets easily irritated and breaks out, gets dry flaky patches, and no matter what cleanser I use, something (the oiliness or the dryness) gets aggravated.  For years, I've stuck with my trusty Cetaphil cleanser and tested other products in between.  My Mom actually gave me this cleanser after I house sat for her and used it and I'm SO glad I tried it.  I absolutely love, love, love this cleanser.  It cleans without stripping my skin, without making my face feel tight, and it takes off every trace of make up including eye make up and mascara. My face is soft and smooth with no dryness, no irritation, and it doesn't feel greasy that way it did with some other gel/cream based cleansers.  About once a week, I leave a bit of the cleanser on my face for 5 minutes to let the enzyme magic do it's thing.  I have no blackheads, not even on my oily t-zone area.  It works really well with the rest of my skin care regiment, and lasts forever!  My first bottle has lasted me 6 months.  Only a little bit is needed, and really, it's not that expensive when you consider how long it lasts, or the great things it does for your skin.	1
I love the seaweed night cream.  Also, the other items that I use fro Mario Badescu.  Thank you for helping me and my husband look younger.  Ruth Taylor	1
Doesn't wash off makeup, leaves my face feeling dirty and like I haven't washed it yet. Very weird smell too, and you need a lot for each application. Not for me. Would not buy again.	-1
This is a fabulously gentle product for my acne prone, sensitive, combination skin. Yeah, I have all of that going on so you know how difficult it is to find something that works but doesn't dry out my dry spots and cleans out the excess oil without promoting future breakouts.  I think I found my product! I have only been using it for a week now but that is usually all it takes for me to figure out if something is going to work for me or not.  I also love the clean smell and soft feel. I purchased the drying lotion as well and have been using both to keep my breakouts in check.	1
One of my recent samples has been Mario Badescu Skin Care Products. I started off with the Almond and Honey Face Scrub which was a pretty gentle scrub. It smells AWESOME, I am a big fan of the sweet almond scent! I give this scent 5 stars :-) I scrubbed it onto my moistened face and rinsed it off, it left my skin feeling very clean and soft.

Out of all these products I loved the Almond and Honey Scrub & the rest of the products were just ok.	1
This is an awesome, gentle toner. I have very fair, sensitive aging skin ('m 53) and I have no trouble using this product daily. I also use the other seaweed products by MB, and they are wonderful as well, especially the seaweed night cream.	1
Love this toner - perfect for acne prone skin. Delicate - non drying and can be used several times a day without stripping PH level on skin.	1
Great mask for 30+ skin.  It moisturizes your skin from within and makes the surface more toned and even.	1
I have used this mask for years and will never stop! It leaves your skin feeling and looking plump and hydrated.  I use it 3 days a week switching off on the days I exfoliate.  Mario Badescu products are amazing and affordability priced. It's easy to know what products will work for your skin type because of the 'code' D for dry S for senstive N for normal and C for combination.  You get the jist. Great products!	1
I agree a little goes a very long way, and it smells fantastic!  This is my new favorite face cleanser.	1
I only have one question:  Where has this been all of my life?!?  This is a fantastic face wash.  I use it with my Clarisonic Mia 2 since it is non-foaming.  The smell is nice and the formula doesn't irritate my skin (dry and sensitive).  I've even gotten my sister and friends hooked on this.  The only thing is it claims to remove make-up, but it's not so great at that.  Therefore, I use this in the morning when I've taken off my make-up the night before.	1
I got an awesome sample of this and could not wait to order some. If you like a cleanser that foams up then this one will take some getting use to. This cleanser does not foam up. I love the enzyme cleansing which helps remove dirt and oils without being over drying. When I apply I let it set on my skin before I rinse. For some extra cleaning I mix some of this cleanser with a mild mask scrub and let it set then rinse, leaves skin glowing.	1
Delicately scented and thoroughly effective. This toner balances out my combination skin, keeps pores unclogged and removes any spec of cleanser or makeup that happened to be left on my skin.	1
I use this after my shower and before a light lotion on my face before I put on makeup. It's quick to use and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. Love it and would recommend to anyone.	1
I was sent a sample of this cleansing lotion from Nordstrom and liked it so much that I purchased more.  It is great for combination skin.  I have oily skin around my nose and upper cheeks as well as my forehead.  The rest of my face is dry.  This is called the 'T-zone'.  I have used this cleanser and it's gentle, does not clog my pores, and has a nice clean smell.  It does not suds up so I need to be careful not to use too much.  I like it a lot.	1
Got this cleanser after a youtube review and have been very pleased. It cleanses gently and thoroughly without drying your skin out. I have very sensitive skin that's easily irritated by almost everything, and this cleanser so far has been awesome. No irritation and the splotches and minor blemishes are clearing up by the day. I do follow it with the Cucumber Lotion and then a moisturizer. Badescu products are very reasonable in price, and do what they promise. I got the smaller sizes to see what works with my particular skin and will get the larger sizes when the ones I decide to stick with run out. I've found the rose hip nourishing oil does redden my face right after use, but it does go away and the moisturizer with the spf stings a bit but it's getting better the more I use it and my skin clears.	1
I love this cleanser. It doesn't lather but cleanses well. I have combo skin, so my t zone breaks out. With this cleanser, my face feels smoother and less dry, w/o it making my t zone greasy. It removes makeup well and can also double as makeup remover and be wiped away. I've been using for weeks and my bottle is only a quarter empty. Great value for such an extraordinary product.	1
This is a truly amazing product. I have very sensitive skin that is dry to combination. I was very surprised that it didn't burn, sting or make my skin brake out in a rash. I apply at night and in the morning I wake up with me face feeling like a babies butt hehe.. Highly recommend it.	1
It is a little greasy but I don't mind since I put it on before bedtime.  My facial skin loves it and make it very soft.  No weird flowery smell.  A little goes a long way.	1
I'm a huge Mario Badescu fan and this cream doesn't disappoint. I have normal to dry skin. My skin still feels nice and moisturize in the morning when I wake up.	1
really good for the price	1
I can't imagine life without this toner. I've honestly never been a believer in toners, until I felt that I had to do something about my skin. My skin was constantly dry, blemishes were a weekly occurrence and I had dark spots from previous blemishes that formed discolorations. A friend recommended this and it has made such a huge difference. I rarely ever have breakouts and my skin is smooth and always fresh feeling. I use this at least 2 times per day (mostly because of how amazing and refreshing it feels). I recently had dry patches of skin around my nose and chapped lips from a very bad cold, and Mario Badescu products helped tremendously. There was no burning feeling, which really showed me how gentle this toner was. Over all, this is one of my greatest finds and I love this (and other Mario Badescu) products.	1
Its very rich and creamy. I like to use it on my neck area  very moisturizing. Would not use it on my face as I'm pretty sure an "acne party" would ensue. Little bit of a bummer because I wanted something ultra-moisturizing for my face for winter. But no biggie and at least my neck is happy :-) Oh and my boyfriend who has very no-fuss clear skin year-round sometimes uses it when hes too dry  he likes it and he is not a product guy at all so thats saying something. So I think people with non-fussy faces that are dry would love this; maybe I'll work up the courage to try on my face heehee	1
This cream is heavy, and stays on and moist until morning. Fixed up my dry winter skin, and I still use it just because, now that my skin is soft again. I also use it on my knees and elbows.	1
No complaints	1
Fresh, clean and a great way to top off a good cleansing regime.  Perfect end of day cleansing when parternered with Seaweed Cleasning "soap".	1
My daughter introduced me to your products.  She has been using Mario Badecus for the past five years.  I love the little samples you include in each order and will be ordering more items in the future.  I love the eye cream and at the age of 80 I need all the help I can get.  Thank you.	1
I love this brand but this product doesnt qork with my skin. So sad. I tried it three times and everytime vroke out really badly after each use. Made my skin soft though.	-1
Leaves my face feeling clean.	1
(Purchased form Ulta)  Right now I have oily combination skin, but mostly oily on T zone and cheeks. I decided to get the Regimen Kit by this company, and in it is a sample of this product.  I cleaned my face and used the toner, then tried this item. I LOVED it instantly. It goes on so smoothly and easily. You only need a tiny bit, even my sample will last a week or two with how little I need to use. It sinks in my skin and leaves me with a nice velvety finish.  The next morning I woke up to smooth skin! NO OIL! I was so blown away. I went and purchased the normal size. It's pricy, I never usually spend more than $7 on a product so this is new to me. But I want to take my skincare seriously and will make the investment. Also, I got another free sample of this cream with my full size purchase from Ulta.	1
Gorgeous night cream, my skin loves it, it doesn't clog up my pores and my skin is clear and soft and glowing.  Excellent product.	1
Super amazing face mask ,,,, just make your skin fresh , tight and glow in 20 mins The best mask ever I use it for years and I'm still very happy with the results .	1
This stuff is like Botox in a jar. Amazing!	1
Perfect Mask!	1
Love it!!	1
Skin feels like new	1
This cream is very moisturizing without being greasy. It sinks in and keeps skin looking soft and supple. It does NOT break me out like most moisturizers or heavy night creams have in the past. The scent is very pleasant and it doesn't take a lot to do the job. Skin is looking much better after only 2 weeks of use!! You can also layer this under your makeup if your skin is very dry and it sinks in and doesn't affect foundation at all. Love the results!	1
If you don't use Mario Badescu's products you're missing out!  His products are natrual and reasonably priced.  I'm in my late forties and when a co-worker told me I have great skin, I jumped for joy.  And purchsed several products for her, for Christmas and yes, she uses them everyday.  I also got my boss hit on his products.  Effective, ship quickly and you'll also receive three free samples with every order.	1
i have a very hard time finding night creams that don't give me acne, but this product is great! feels very thick at first, but absorbs well and leaves skin feeling very smooth.	1
Face feels lifted after use	1
it was a gift and there are no complaints	1
I expected another type of mask but this one is ok!	1
This is a great collagen builder mask for the face ..I have notice that my face looks a lot plumper and the skin looks even more healthier..	1
Great collagen mask. It's soothing, firming and helps clear blemishes. Love it!	1
Totally agree with the other posters, this stuff is wonderful.  It works so well, it cleans so thoroughly and yet doesn't dry my skin out or clog my pores.  I tend to be a little on the dry side but I also get whiteheads and blackheads and cystic acne flareups.  This cleanser leaves my skin clean, smooth, but not dry and I never, ever break out.  Best part of all?  It's absolutely inexpensive, compared to the size of products that give you maybe 1/4th the product for three times the price.  For the price, this stuff is amazing, but even if it cost more, I'd still buy it.  It's that good.	1
The gel burnt under my eyes. It got slightly swollen under there as well. Use with caution	-1
This stuff makes me greasy and I break out when I use it.	-1
I wasn't a fan of this cleanser at all. It's gooey, messy, and feels like cement mix. Also there are many black specs in it that sticks to everything, and not just your skin. These black specs will stick to your sink or shower. The consistency here is not pleasurable and I would old good old fashioned soap instead. A big pass here.  Katiebabs	-1
I am a fan of Mario Badescu products.  I have recommended them to clients with skin sensitivities and in most cases they have been very happy with their performance.  Once in a while, however, I come across a product which I am not as fond of.  This, unfortunately, happens to be one of them.  WHAT IS THIS CLEANSER LIKE? A nice sized bottle, I do like the color of the cleanser.  It reminds me of pistachio ice cream.  The texture of the cleanser is very creamy and thick.  It has tiny flecks of dark green in it which is the seaweed.  The fragrance is a touch overwhelming for me, however.  I am not sure what it is.  It just is not a smell that I enjoy a whole lot.  The label stays on and does not come off like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mario-Badescu-The-Moisture-Magnet-SPF-15-2-oz/dp/B0015Z532O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mario Badescu The Moisture Magnet SPF 15, 2 oz.</a>.  HOW DOES THIS CLEANSING SOAP PERFORM? A little goes  along way of this stuff.  It is thick and creamy and a delightful green color.  The cream smears around on the skin nicely and when adding a little bit of water to it, it does foam up some, but is not really sudsy like some soaps can be.  It does make skin soft at first, but then I feel as if the skin is too stripped.  The time that I am testing this in is a time of humidity and more oiliness and this cleanser is stripping my skin already- in winter, I am thinking it will be way too much for me to use.  I have normal to dry skin.  I have had my daughter test it.  She said it was nice at first but felt it stripped her skin a bit too much.  In both cases, the skin surface felt smooth, although dry and tight.  I have not had the men try it yet- they don't like to try new products. It is hard to pin them down.  THE WORST PART- ITCHING The worst part about this cleanser is that it made our skin itch a bit.  Perhaps it was from drying it out so much or maybe the sodium laureth sulfate it contains, but it just makes the skin feel uncomfortable.  No matter how much lotion I apply, it does not seem to soothe this feeling entirely.  THE BOTTOM LINE Great sized bottle, lovely texture and green color, this soap seemed promising.  Creamy and easy to use without being overly foamy, I found the fragrance to be a bit overwhelming and it left our skin stripped and a bit itchy and uncomfortable and tight.  I have given this one star.  If you have very oily skin and perhaps don't mind it being a strong cleanser, then perhaps you would like it.  For us, it really is rough on our skin and it just leaves us too uncomfortable to rate it higher than that.	-1
I have purchased Mario Badescu products in the past.  This Seaweed Cleansing Soap, I didn't like the scent, I felt like I was putting a salad on my face, which I didn't like the little pieces in the cleansing soap, plus it really left my skin feeling clean, but overly clean, stripped, not feeling soft.  They say on the bottle that it's suitable for all skin types, which is kind of subjective to me.  Yes I want my face to feel clean when Iam using a cleansing product, but I don't like it feeling stripped. This also left my facial skin looking red, which really surprised me.  Not sure if Iam allergic to an ingredient in it or not.  Live and learn!	-1
I really wanted to like this cleanser. I mean the name of it just sounds amazing. Upon opening it, there's no seal on it. The smell is not too bad. It's a pleasant smell but definitely a little bit artificial. There are little bits of pieces in this to help exfoliate the skin. I have used it for a few days now - hoping for what happened the first time was a fluke but I think I am allergic to something in this because every time I used it, my skin would break out. I have not had as much break out as when I was a teenager - over 15 years ago.  I tried going back to my usual cleaner and noticed that my skin was a lot less irritated. So there's something in this making my skin irritated and I don't even have super sensitive skin. I have combination skin and as nice as this smells, it didn't work for me.	-1
This is a cucumber scented, 4% rubbing alcohol solution. Yes, that means it is 96% water. Save yourself some money and skip this.	-1
Makes my skin break out	-1
Doesn't Smell good.  Burns and makes skin angry.  Would not recommend.	-1
This would be my first feedback on Amazon. This junk does not work. It smells horrific, used it enough to see results happen. They never did. My skin got worse . Would never purchase again. Wasted my money.	-1
I am not happy with the product because it isn't the item I actually wanted to buy... I meant to purchase the Pevonia RS2 Lotion ( I don't use the cleanse) but your company won't let me return & exchange it for the correct one.	-1
Maybe I just got a bad or old batch, but this smelled sour when I received it. Returned!	-1
This item arrived without any kind of packaging...  This lotion/toner did not work well with my combination skin type...  Not sure if the lactic acid was the culprit or not, but I would not purchase this again.	-1
I bought this product because it is listed as a lotion for rosacea, and dry, sensitive skin. It is not a lotion. It is a non aerosole spray of very watery, milky liquid. I am returning this, and would not purchase this again. I also don't like the vendors return policy of return within 7 days of purchase, less restocking fee. The return time expires before the product is received, Ridiculous.	-1
The sprayer is not a very fine mist...and it's too expensive.	-1
Not authentic! Does not work like the real ones! Piece of junk	-1
love Mario Badescu products but this one made me break out!	-1
Despite the name saying oil control, this lotion is VERY oily. So oily, in fact, that when I squeeze it out, only oil comes out. I have tried shaking and massaging the bottle, and it still is separated. I am so frustrated this is a poor product. I'm obsessed with the Mario Badescu line so I'm assuming this is a very old product that the seller tried to pass off. If it wasn't such a pain to return it, I would have. It's just went in the trash after 4 or 5 tries. What a waste	-1
I bought this because of the good reviews. Didn't work for me at all. Left me with blurry vision. Other cleansing oils work far better and can be used for the entire face.	-1
UPDATE: At first I loved the texture of this product, but it makes me break out horribly. I stopped using it for about a month and my skin improved. I used it twice in the last week and I'm breaking out like crazy again.  I gave it to my boyfriend and it seems to work well for his (less sensitive) skin. I'm disappointed and will not buy it again.	-1
Supposed to help with my type of skin. Does the opposite. I got itchy and broke out all over using this. It smells nice though. I wouldn't use it again. I have sensitive/combo skin.	-1
This made my chest and back acne worse than I've seen it in a long time. Granted, maybe my body had already planned to freak out in acne before I started using this. However, it did nothing to help the situation. I also made the mistake of using this on my lady parts which proved quite irritating. Ps the smell was not good.	-1
Did not do anything special for my KP otherwise a nice soap but overpriced for what it doesn't do	-1
Looks pretty, pink, and creamy with strawberry seeds as described.  Expected a lovely strawberry smell, but just smelled like lotion.  Also felt like a cream lotion.  Did nothing at all.  Followed up with my clean and clear scrub to get the job done.	-1
Makes my skin feel dry and itchy	-1
The mask feels slightly tacky and I didn't notice any real difference in my skin after. I was scared I would break out but didn't. I wouldn't recommend the mask, although I usually love this brand	-1
drys.  tightened? in dry sense only	-1
Warning. This product contains peanut oil. Not only does it not work, it could kill someone with a peanut allergy. Great job, Mario.	-1
Came inside a plastic bag with half the bottle spilled everywhere and the box came wet. My rose water and cucumber water ugh. Next time Im not buying this online anymore the kids weren't even full screwed on.  I ordered rose water, cucumber water, glycolic toner and orange cleansing soap and 3 out of 4 bottles cake leaking. Horrible only the orange cleansing soap didn't leak because its ticker formula	-1
I was disappointed by this. I have an enzyme cleanser by another brand and it does a great job at exfoliating dry skin. I thought that's what enzymes did -- not the Mario Badescu gel: my skin is still dry and flaky. It doesn't foam, which I could live with, but I also can't see it on my skin so it's hard to tell if I've thoroughly covered my face. It does have a great smell and a cooling sensation, though I don't want cooling in the winter time. I also still got zits while using this, so this product is useless to me. (But I appreciate receiving this as a free promotional gift as I had been intending to buy it.)	-1
Some other reviewer said it felt like spreading yogurt on your face.  That's true, and like yogurt it's not going to take your makeup off. Be prepared to wash your face a second time with something else.  Nobody's got time for that, or at least I don't.  No noticeable improvement.	-1
This product is alright but i don't think my skin like ita very much	-1
didnt work for me burned my skin moving on from Mario Badescu tried multiple products nothing worked!	-1
This candle smells like your eccentric old aunt's guest room. You know--the one who uses scented sachets in the bureau drawers and feeds you expired biscuits for tea.	-1
Sticky. I don't like this at all. I got a spray bottle and distilled water like I have done for years. That works fine.	-1
To do all over again WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT.  Is it suppose to do anything but spray your face because you can do that with cool water & save $$	-1
I've used a full catalogue of Elemis products for over a month and am leaving reviews on each one.  Regarding the Marine Creme, I haven't found it to be of any use. Elemis boasts this as their most popular product but I can't understand why as I see no real benefit. In fact, my complexion was more congested after using this. Considering the massive price-tag, this earns it a very low rating.  I personally think Elemis reviews their own products with high marks as part of their marketing initiative because I find most of them to be shockingly overrated.	-1
Not at all what I expected, for me does not work, my face looks worse than before. I will never order again this brand.	-1
I wanted to love this, because my skin needs extra moisture once I've applied my make up and throughout the day. However, if you have sensitive skin, this will more than likely irritate your skin. I rarely break out anymore but something in the ingredients clogged my pores & caused me to have a horrible acne breakout all over my face.	-1
Originally, I loved this iron. However, after a couple of months, it stopped working properly. The light flashes and doesn't heat continually, so it was definitely faulty. I contacted the seller and they said they could do nothing about it. So, it was a waste of money.	-1
I read all the 5 star reviews on this curling iron and I went for it.  I now regret the purchase, while it does get hot, it does not get hot enough for my hair. I also don't recommend this size for loose fat Victorias secret curls. Go with the 1 1/4, and also a different brand. I have heard many good things about Hot tools, but I cannot recommend this curling iron for thick coarse hair. (I can't speak for thin hair)	-1
Something isn't right about the hot tools on here.	-1
There are two major drawbacks to this flat iron. 1) the outside casing gets extremely hot - hot enough to burn your fingers when you clamp it down and 2) it does not have an automatic turn-off. Frankly, I've switched back to my $30 Remington flat iron. This is just not worth the price.	-1
after just 3 years the wire came loose in the handle and now blinks on and off. Poor design!!!	-1
At first this was great - heated up nicely and made great curls.  But less than a month later, it doesn't heat up well at all; I thought I accidentally changed the temp setting but it was on the highest setting and doesn't do a thing.  Too late to return it, I wasted 30 bucks.  Don't make the same mistake I did!	-1
Great brand but the clamp crimped my hair so badly I returned it and ended up buying another one without it.	-1
This product makes my hair stiff and dry and crunchy.  It also made the ends look frizzy.	-1
The heat on this flat iron seems less than the babyliss I owned before (pink for breast awareness). I don't know if I got a bad batch but I will work around it to get the results I need.	-1
Get's hot quick, but does not curl my hair. I have a older one that takes forever to get hot but when it does, it gives me a tight curl, but for some reason no matter how long i keep this iron in my hair, i can't get a curl.	-1
Didn't not work at all didn't get warm at all! Do not buy save your money and buy a NuMe wand instead!	-1
works amazingly. This is my second one. the first one broke after 5 years of use. it makes my hair so shiny... Update: Bought my second one through amazon and it broke less than one year.. The barrel does NOT heat up anymore ... Makes me question the quality control ...	-1
I returned this item as it didn't work after one use. I've had this brand before, really liked it so I was very disappointed. Also the design was different. For the money I expected much better.	-1
Blades do not contact properly and the handle is uncomfortable and gets WAY too hot.	-1
I normally love this curling iron, this one MUST be defective, it does not clamp shut, so therefore it does not curl properly. waste of money	-1
I tried it on the middle setting first after reading all the "my hair melted off" reviews.  Nothing impressive or scary, not even close to hot enough so cranked it up bit by bit to the highest setting.  Yes, the want was hot.  No it did nothing to curl my hair. Mind you, I had just tried the Bed Head Rock 'n' Roller Ceramic Styling Iron and while it curled (really curled) my hair, the Hot Tools one left a bit of a wave with a smidge of a curl on the end.  Meh.  Returned it.	-1
One of the draws for this iron is the static control for fine hair. It simply isn't true. I had lots of static issues with it and at this price, expected more.	-1
I love this brand of polish.  Have been using their products for years and have never been disappointed - until now!  Not only didn't it chip - HALF MY POLISH CAME RIGHT OFF!  the top half of FOUR nails were bare to the nail in less than THREE DAYS!!  So when they say no chips - they mean it - because the polish doesn't have a chance to chip!!  It just peels right off!  I will throw it out - not worth returning - but will never purchase again....  I still love their regular polishes though and will continue to use them,	-1
I have fine hair and had hoped that if I used just a real, tiny amount it would be okay, but not so at all.  No amount of this is small enough for fine hair, period.  I gave my bottle to a girl at the office who has a full head of thick medium length hair, and she really likes it, said even her husband likes it on his super long beard.  So it's a good product, obviously, just have to have the hair for it, which I do not.  Thanks!	-1
Leaves a film on my skin and actually is causing break outs due to clogged pores. This really sucks since I heard such great reviews about this product. It doesn't leave your face feeling all tight and dry, that is true, but not much consolation when you are breaking out and have clogged pores.	-1
I'm not really sure what all the hype is about with this product, but I'm happy that it turned me on to the brand.  The Mario Badescu buffering lotion, drying cream, acne cleanser, and special c clearing lotion were very effective.  I also like that the formulas are simple without a lot of extra added chemicals.  Although this particular product didn't work for me, a bunch of his other products have.  This is a great brand!	-1
I have cystic, hormonal acne and I heard that Mario Badescu products work well. I purchased this and the Buffering Lotion and the Buffering Lotion works SO much better at reducing my acne than this does. This one is messy, application is weird (you have to apply it with a qtip or something else you can dip into the sediment at the bottom of the bottle) and the ingredients are essentially calamine lotion and alcohol. It also did nothing for my acne. I know this works for many people, so Im guessing it works better for white heads and smaller breakouts, however cystic acne tends to respond better to sulphur- based products (this is definitely true for me) and the Buffering Lotion is sulphur-based.	-1
not for me. break me out so bad!!!!	-1
This product is overrated. No major improvements, little to zero...irritates my skin.	-1
I must be mutant. Nothing that works for the majority of the consumers never works for me. I used this, along with other Mario Badescu products, and nothing. I saw zero change in my face.	-1
Don't know what was the hype about all over you tube, i get occasional break out and this product did not help. I normally love Mario Badescus product and currently addicted with Cleansers and toners but drying lotion didn't was ok. Read my full review at [...]	-1
Too drying and not effective.	-1
0 effect on acnes. The stage of acne does not matter... like i did not applied anything. Origin acne spot remover is 10 times better than this one.	-1
This arrived without ANY sort of seal, it was not even in any kind of box or protective wrapper, and the product is LIQUID.	-1
After reading all the positive reviews, I was really excited to give this a try. Well, I'm sorry I did because the product didn't really work for me. It didn't shrink pimples or get rid of them. I get like 1 pimple a month and it didn't do anything to help. I would not buy this product again.	-1
Didn't work!	-1
I purchased this from Ulta. I enjoy a couple of MB other things, so gave this a try. I have sensitive, combination oily, acne prone skin. I used this item maybe 6 times during a 3 week period. I followed the directions closely, and used it on a few acne spots on my face. Out of the few, only one whitehead disappeared within a few days. I don't know if it's because of this item, or the fact that I for once didn't pick at my skin and left it alone, or that I used a Clarisonic brush on my face daily. But since the other acne spots didn't disappear either, I contribute it to the fact that I didn't mess with my face and tried very hard to keep my face clean and moisturized. I think this stuff is overpriced for the value. I have better results using drug store brands, changing pillow cases and towels every other day, and keeping my hands off my face. I returned it.	-1
I have become confused on what exactly the point of this product is. I saw some feedback on people who use it as a cleanser on those days where you want to "rush" off or just go to bed without washing your face, but this makes no sense to me. These pads are astringent toner pads, not cleanser pads. They will not provide you with a cleanse, that is why on the directions it says use after cleansing, but before moisturizer. If you wash your face then use these pads it will not make your skin dry, but rather kind of sticky. If you try and put any sort of moisturizer on after the pads it will make your face look disgusting. Like you haven't showered in about 2 days, very greasy. I attempted to use just the pads and no moisturizer, but my face just looked oily and felt very sticky. Now I think girls like a man with a nice smooth face, not one that feels dirty. I shave everyday so I expect that smooth feeling day in and day out, and that is exactly what I had before these pads. I stumbled upon this item when doing a search for a good toner and saw all the fantastic reviews so I purchased them, what a mistake. I stopped using them yesterday and my skin is back to being a little dry and I actually don't mind it. Much better than looking dirty and oily. I will say on the plus that these pads don't burn at all even when used after shaving, for those who care I shave with a DE feather blade which can be very harsh on skin, and it helps with razor burn on the neck by healing it faster. This is when the ingredient witch hazel comes into play (ingredient in the product). That's the only plus I have to mention about these pads. I really have no idea where the target market for this product is, as I can only image what it would do for someone with oily skin or normal skin (my skin is very dry). Pads cover the entire face and neck with no problems, just be sure to flip the pad over half way through so you get the most out of the pads.	-1
It's always preferable when trying a new scent to wait approximately 1/2 hour to see how your body reacts.  While I'm certain that this Juicy Couture Eau de Parfum Spray will be fine on some individuals, I found it to be too cloying and sweet for my taste.  I much prefer my signature Mitsouko by Guerlain or the very difficult to find, Kingdom by Alexander McQueen.	-1
I have a multitude of "designer deodorants" and while this has absolutely NO SCENT it caused a reaction on my skin. I've never had this issue with ANY deodorant before however I will never purchase this deodorant again.	-1
Didnt see and feel what I read in most of the reviews, I have curly hair, not very thick but freeze. Not for me	-1
I wanted to like this product. I tried it a couple times, but I just can't use it any more. It's got great ingredients and did make my skin soft and for that I give it the 2 stars. For me though, first of all, I really didn't like the scent. I'm not sure what it was about it that didn't please me, but it certainly didn't smell good to my nose. Secondly, the moisturizer felt really heavy and slithery on my skin and felt like it didn't absorb very well.  I guess that's really all I have to say. So, for the price, I would not buy this product. Read the other reviews though, this may be just personal preference.	-1
While this moisturizer has some good ingredients and an acceptable aroma, it feels sticky on the skin well after applying and doesn't really absorb as well as it should - which is saying something in my case because my dry skin tends to suck up all moisture that even comes close.  I also have sensitive skin, and it kinda burns just a little.  I really WANTED to like this product after looking at the list of organic ingredients, but I just don't.	-1
Juice Beauty Green Apple Age Defy Serum is too much for my sensitive skin.  Other non-sensitive Juice products do not irritate my skin the way this does.  It is pleasant to apply, but it did leave my skin in a fussier state.  A closer peek at the ingredients revealed salicylic acid (from white willow bark), which is an ingredient that my skin tends to rebel against.	-1
I'll be honest that I selected this item from the Vine program mostly for the serum and less for the face clearing since I don't really have acne, just the occasional breakout. The problem I have is that every time I do get a blemish, the spot, even when healed takes forever to fade and I have been looking for something that fades and evens out those spots.  I decided to try the whole "system" and after the first use, I have opted not to use it again. First, the smell is unpleasant, or at least it was to me. Perhaps extended use would work wonders for the skin, but I am unable to stomach the smell so that's something. I used the cleanser, serum and moisturizer, just as indicted in the instructions. After the first and only use, my skin felt dry with an odd texture - hard to explain, not exactly smooth or silky or very sticky (just a little sticky), just weird. Then I started to itch and feel tingling. Not good tingling, more burning, rashy tingling. Nothing that I'd ever want to feel again. I did not try the peel, one whiff and I felt nauseated. I will use the bamboo washcloth again, however. It's really great.  So while this may have long-term benefits, I am unable (unwilling) to re-use this.  I urge every potential buyer to read ALL reviews before purchasing this product. Although some people used this with good results, the manufacturer does not seem like it cares or is customer friendly or even willing to help those people who had legitimate customer service issues.  I cannot recommend this product.	-1
I should have known it was a bad sign when the box came completely open and destroyed. Thankfully everything inside was still wrapped so I decided to give it a try anyway. Within a few days I saw my skin get redder and more sensitive than it ever was before. I don't know if there's something in the products I was allergic to, but I had to quit it.	-1
I asked my daughter to try this skin kit out.  She has problem skin.  She told me that she likes the cleanser which made her skin feel tighter and tingling clean, she had nothing good to say about the moisturizer. She didn't like the smell, and also thought the moisturizer was way too thick.  We don't understand why someone concerned with acne would want a moisturizer so thick that it may clog facial pores.  She saw no improvement in her skin with these products.  So no recommendation for this skin care kit.	-1
In the past, I have used Juice Beauty's moisturizer and was so pleased with it I thought ordering this acne set for my teenager would be a no-brainer. Boy, was I wrong!   First, I must address the odor issue. The face wash and acne clearing serum smelled absolutely rancid.  When we first opened the acne clearing serum tube, the content came squirting and losing out. The serum was very liquidy, like water with smelly brown grains.  It looked like  puddle water and smelled like pond scum.  I immediately checked the date on the box, but we weren't near expiration.  I don't think the serum should have had the consistency our tube had.   My son decided to try it despite it being malodorous and having an odd consistency. Unfortunately, after two weeks of using it his skin is dry it out and his acne looks no better. He decided to stop using it and pitch in the garbage. I can't blame him.  Despite it being malodorous and having an odd consistency. Unfortunately, after two weeks of using it his skin is dry it out and his acne looks no better. He decided to stop using it and pitch in the garbage. I can't blame him.   I would not  recommend the acne kit.  Frankly, buying good old Noxzema, Ckearisil, or Neutrogena is the better way to go	-1
Was not impressed - but would probably be a good fit for someone with more sensitive skin. I needed more than this.	-1
September Update  Ultimately I was unable to continue using ANY of the products from JB. Emailed. The company is more interested in taking your $ and refuse to refund any of my purchases - even though I can't use any of them. So not only was I brushed off but I was outright told I could not get a refund even though they push clients to use the products passed the 45 day refund period. This company does not back their product. They will encourage you to use something else on their line OR continue using the acne kit, stating on the website, it can take several weeks (i.e. well over a month) to see if the "purge" will subside. A GOOD company would refund customers who are dissatisfied and having serious reactions to their products. I will warn you now, buy it, but be aware that getting a refund will be nearly impossible if your have problems.  ******** Seems the good people at JB are too busy to address my issue with their product so I found it best to forewarn anyone thinking about trying this product of my experience thus far. I've been acne plagued for more than 2 count them 2 decades. I've tried everything with continued disappointment including anything my dermatologist recommended. I decided to get this on a whim and the first week or so it "seemed" to show improvement.  Now, many people say with a new product there may be a "purging" stage where the acne is cycling thru and eventually it'll leave you with better looking skin thereafter. So far my "purge" is the worst my acne has ever looked and is emerging in places I've never had acne. How can that be? One thing to tell me my regular acne or hidden acne will pop up faster during a purge, but explain the logic behind acne on parts of my face never seen? My face has been completely ravaged and I'm on my 2nd month.  When I posted something with JB hoping to get assistance, I got nothing, nana, zip. Seems they were just more happy to have suckered me into a 2nd month and didn't feel the need to help out someone who could potentially be a lifelong customer IF this horrible purge ever passes because I'm pretty determined. Instead, I'm left to assume it'll either get better in the next 30 days or I'll need to go to another product. If it improves I'll keep it - but as it's looking (which is pretty darn nasty at the moment) I'll likely employ their so-called return policy - again I just have to see if this purge is a myth or not. I've had similar breakouts, but nothing like this.  I've used this regime religiously - alas just getting worse for now - all over my forehead (never break out there), all over my jawline (painful, scarring red patches on both sides), all around my lips. I've pretty much had to cut out make up most days because it makes it look like scabbed, uneven pavement.  The product - ok, the facewash is good. Doesn't dry out your face the moment you towel it off. Smells kinda lemon-esk to me. Nothing to write home about - functional, more than enough to get you through several dozen washes. The serum - so far I'm not seeing any improvements related to the would-be acne fighter. A little goes a long way. The lotion is mighty sticky, weird, very oil-free - so much so it'll suck the surface of your skin dry. I find my face is oilier in the middle of the day using this regime. If it were really balancing it wouldn't be nearly like the oil slick that it is. I have to constantly blot my acne prone, combination skin with those oil-absorbing sheets. Didn't have to do that as often before.  I'm afraid by the time I finally "grow out of" my acne it'll be time for wrinkle cream. Anyway, overall the product seems fine - the only item out of the entire kit I'd repurchase at this point - considering I'm still in the dreaded purge - is the facial peel. I love the peel. I could just about eat it out of the jar. Again, I use it as recommended and it seems to help the acne (when applied at night). The morning after when I awake the acne appears diminished. Then a couple days later I have a whole new crop of white and red beauties to remind me this kit isn't working out very well. Be prepared to be snubbed by JB after they've gotten your money because that's how I feel.  I'll consider editing my review at the end of next month - I'll be officially through two whole months & we'll see where my face is then.  *****  August Update Ultimately, I gave up using this kit other than the peel and the blemish clearing stick (which you'd buy separately). Only using up what I have left of the peel as I've found one made with similar ingredients for WAY less than what the standard jar costs. And ounce for ounce the stick isn't exceptional.  The products overall, I'm sad to say, never completely eliminated my problem: high cost - no real results. Had it, obviously I would be raving about it and not complaining about the cost (when you invest in the standard bottles). When will these companies get that if something really works people will happily pay for it - so long as it's reasonable? Anyway, I gave up on the all natural toner & have moved onto trying the Clinique acne kit in hopes it may slay my acne beast. But that's a new regime for me and thus I can't say for sure how it's going as of yet.  My JB purge was so damaging that my dark marks are still healing and I took a little break in-between the kits by washing with mild facewash and spot treating. Additionally, I developed noticeable blackheads which I'd never really had a problem with before JB.  Ideally, I'd like to think this JB kit could work for someone, but not if you have sensitive + oily skin. I'm assessing my "purge" was my skin reacting poorly to the product. However, many are vague as to how to distinguish between a reaction and a so called purge - if the purge actually exists, you know. Therefore, I suggest if you are breaking out in places you typically don't you may be having a poor reaction to something in the product. If you are an oil slick 30 days into "testing" a new regime, you're likely not acclimating to it well. That was the case for me anyway.	-1

Generally speaking, I love this line but this product should not be called a scrub it. It should not even be sold. The sporadic sharp grains of almonds are very abrasive and my skin can take almost any scrub. In fact I rarely find an affective scrub. This so-called scrub however is ineffectual in every way. Baking soda delivers way more value.	-1
I needed to change my review. After a few weeks of use- I have broken out worse than anything in my life. My skin has never been in this bad of shape in my life even in my teenage years! Bioelements and I clearly do not work well. I switched back to Dermalogica and instantly cleared up. Never switching again in my life.	-1
The lipstick was broken when I got it so now I can only apply it with my finger.  Most of it was broken off in the lid.  Bummer.	-1
This product will mess up your hair as if you've been to the beach, but your hair will smell very strongly perfumed. I don't use it anymore because of overwhelming scent.	-1
made my hair soooooo dry and stiff. felt awful.	-1
I found this shampoo difficult to lather. I really had to use a lot to get even a small lather. This does not perform consistently for me and the price is too high. I have thick hair anyway, so I did not notice much of a change in the thickness/quality of my hair. I won't be buying this again.	-1
Tried this after becoming very disappointed with the AOS (art of shaving) shaving cream line. This wasn't the solution. Ingredient list has all the right stuff, but I find the lather to be extremely weak. Very very small layer of protection even when I use a generous amount of cream. Can't even use my badger brush and a bowl to bring a healthy lather, just won't work. Experimented with proper amounts of water several times to see if I could find the right consistency, but could never find it. I would amount this to being the shaving cream. I will continue my search as this product just wasn't for me. The art of shaving provides a better leather, but is very drying. This product makes canned gillette creams look like the "cream of the crop".	-1
I love most of Jack Black's products but I feel like this one is a miss for me.  They call it a lather but it hardly lathers at all.  For the price, I want superior protection which I feel it did not provide so it looks like I'm going back to gels.	-1
Was really thick like old Chapstick.  Probably won't buy anymore since you get like three sticks with the kit. Not moist	-1
you have to use a lot if you have thick hair and for the price point it's not worth it. the peppermint essential oils in this are too concentrated and will burn your eyes	-1
Wow, this bottle is SO TINY - I didn't realize how small it was going to be. I was looking for an alternative to dry shampoos that use alcohol. I tried it, not impressed. Smell is ok.	-1
Powder color is off, much lighter than expected, not the same as I have gotten before but should be. Can not compare to Bare Minerals.	-1
Made under my eyes very dry.	-1
I don't think this minimized my pores that much unfortunately.	-1
Didn't do anything for me - didn't change the appearance of my pores at all.	-1
I ordered honey bronze and got this color,called and did not receive good help. I went back to order really watching what I was doing and every time I put in honey bronze  it went back to golden glow, so I went to ebay  you should check that site.	-1
I have combination skin and a little redness/rosacea going on. The color warm sienna took care of the redness, but got very oily in the T-zone. So, I bought the Absence oil control to wear under the makeup. The Absence makes the color whiter, as it is white and doesn't control the oil enough. Absence is very hard to apply too little does nothing, too much, it looks white and adds flaking......I'm not too happy	-1
I had bought this scent in reed diffusers, and absolutely loved it. So when I saw a room spray - visions of vanilla & bourbon danced in my head. Sadly to say the scent lasts for a whole whopping minute :( What a huge waste of money.	-1
Awful color!!	-1
It's hard to give an objective review when I've only been able to use this about five times before the tip wore down rendering it unusable as I need very thin, soft strokes which a stub cannot give.  There was no sharpener in the package I received. I tried using other brow pencil sharpeners but none worked (they only wore down the tip). The lack of proper sharpener may have affected application but not the other elements (texture, color, look when applied, price/value ratio) that are a part of evaluating this pencil's effectiveness.  I've used a wide variety of eyebrow pencils over the years at a variety of price points. The best are easy to apply in that they don't seem to cake or clump and go on evenly (with a well-sharpened tip) and don't smudge; you can shape the tip as needed to give thicker or thinner lines. The consistency (a bit waxy but not too much), which you can't try before you buy, is a key factor in both application and longevity, once applied.  Other than the color itself, there's nothing that I liked about this product. Which is disappointing as this is a good brand and I've used other Longo products and been satisfied with their performance. It's especially disappointing given the price point.  Application: Not as easy as other pencils, which is due, in part, I think, to the consistency (waxy, clumpy) and the size of the tip (too small and chubby and not thin enough to my liking).  Texture: Not as smooth as other pencils I've used. Took longer to apply and had to keep smudging and fiddling with Q-tips to get a neat line. Didn't go on "evenly."  Look when applied: Seemed heavier and line was not as strong and consistent. Getting a thin line was very difficult (again, an issue of consistency and size/shape of product tip)  Color: This was a really good color for me, even though I have medium brown hair. I have found that many products labeled "blonde" are the right shade either alone or when used to lighten up a darker color.  Price/Value: Simply not there for me. I've had better application, better looking brows with pencils that were cheaper. But since a person's brows (color, texture, etc.) differ greatly, this may work better for you than me. I have thin-ish brows and need thin, really feathery lines, which this could not deliver.	-1
I have used a lot of different brow products over time, and one thing that I have a difficult time finding is a brow product that does not settle into the skin, pores, or smear while wearing in the day.  I have used the Vincent Longo Blonde Micro Pencil for several weeks now and I have to say that it does not wear well.  The pencil goes in nicely with very fine lines and it is easy to apply and make faux hairs in the brow area.  The color is nice- very close to MAC Lingering or Tarte Taupe brow pencils in color.  The pencil itself is very thin, which means that you have to use a special sharpener.  The sharpener is not attached at all to the pencil, so if you lose it, you are out of luck.  I don't like that feature.  What I have found with this pencil is that despite it looking very close in color to the other two which I have previously mentioned, it does not wear as well.  I have done one brow with this pencil and a different one on the other.  At the end of the day, the other brand is still good, but the Vincent Longo pencil is smeary, spotty, and seems to have settled into my pores a bit too.  I do not have oily skin.  For the price, I don't think that this brow pencil works for me anyway.  Nice color, but very disappointing wear time.  I don't want to have to try that hard with any brow products. I prefer to apply and not have to think about it for the rest of the day.	-1
Feels like antiseptic lotion. Not hip on it. Won't buy again. However it's a large tube	-1
If you are looking at this product because somehow the name implies that it's 'water' and therefore better than say, something with silicone? It's not. It has silicone.  I've used a ton of primers, from cheap to pricey. This one falls somewhere towards the lower end of wear for me. I have combination skin (older skin to boot but I use peels) and this primer made my foundation patchy after a few hours. I'm currently wearing Lancme Teinte Idole 24Hr over their Lancme-branded Pro base. The Lancme foundation slid around on the Vincent Longo base. I normally get about 12 hours of uninterrupted wear out of the Lancme otherwise.  It did feel nice going on, and it smelled pleasant. But wear? Didn't do anything good for me.	-1
I have had the occasion to use several Vincent Longo products and I realize that this line of products provides a high quality product for a pretty hefty price.  In most situations I have found you get a really good product for your investment.  However, in this case, I am just not sure about this one.  SIZE Vincent Longo Water Canvas Base comes in a black tube which looks pretty nice on the product page, but in reality, when you get it, the small size is rather shocking. There is only .88 oz of product in the tube, which if you translate it, you can imagine three tubes of Jack Black lip balm and that is about the size of this product.  TEXTURE I have tried many times to see what might be different about this primer compared to many others out there.  I have to say after testing this repeatedly, I just don't see any advantage of using this primer.  The feel of this product is that you use a pearl sized drop of this product applied around your entire face and eyes.  When I do this, I feel a lot of silicone feel to it.  This leaves my face feeling like it has saran wrap on it of sorts.  It is hard to explain, but after a while of wearing this primer, I feel like my face wants to breathe and I want to remove it.  AFFECT ON MAKEUP  This primer base definitely does smooth out the skin and does allow for the foundation and other face makeup to stay on the face nicely.  It seems to make the makeup stay on well through the day and it does add to a nice appearance of the skin.  I also find when using this, that blush does not tend to change color like some other primers can do.  I still did not enjoy wearing it over time, however, so I am not sure it served that great of a purpose.  FINAL COMMENTS  For the price, I just don't see how this product is worth the money.  I have normal to dry skin and I didn't feel any particular moisturizing features from this base.  I get much nicer results when using Swanson Vitamins Hyaluronic Acid Serum which is very similar to Lorac Aquaprime which was discontinued.  I just don't like this primer and didn't feel it is worth the investment.  You get so little product for a very high price.  Using it under Vincent Longo Water Canvas Foundation does make it look very nice, however, if you have the money to invest and want to use them together.  There are other options that are more cost effective, however if you prefer a less expensive alternative base to use.	-1
Vincent Longo Water Canvas Base takes the saying "a little goes a long way" a little too seriously. This tiny tube of foundation base is not worth $45.00, not to me anyway. Yes, it's creates a nice soft feeling on your skin but it did not help my makeup stay put or minimize pores like other, less expensive bases and primers. It actually felt like glycerin which you can pick up anywhere for a fraction of this price. I didn't notice any difference in the final look with or without it. I was very disappointed and could not imagine ever purchasing or recommending Canvas Base, not when there are plenty of products available that do the job perfectly.	-1
Vincent Longo Water Canvas Base is a product that is touted to ensure that makeup goes on smoothly, will protect skin with moisture, and reduce the appearance of fine lines.  Using the product, I tried differing application methods: Over slightly moist skin Over patted dry skin  Application method: Small amount gently applied Small amount gently worked into the skin til almost absorption More generous application in problem areas  Followed by: Moisturizer No Moisturizer  Followed by: Regular foundation Oil free foundation  Followed by: Light dusting of mineral based powder  In every method: There was no pore refinement, nor reduction in the appearance of fine lines My makeup did not set in the light coverage I strive for Moisturized initially, but did not seem to be as good as my other products (tried on neck area for this assessment)  While this product did not irritate my skin, I found no benefit for this pricey offering.	-1
On the one hand, this product doesn't burn or cause skin irritation. On the other hand, it doesn't do anything at all.	-1
The exfoliating quality of Baxter of California Night Cream AHA comes from this lotion's glycolic acid base, which is a very mild alpha hydroxyl formulation.  After several weeks of use, I saw no redness as I've experienced with other exfoliants.  But neither did I see any real change in my skin.  I like the feel of it:  non-oily, dry, almost talc-y. Dense, yet easily spreadable.  And a dab covers quite a bit of territory.  But after 30 minutes, my skin feels no different than before.  Night Cream AHA is not entirely odorless for me;  it's got an elusive "nearly chemical" fragrance.  I'm grateful it's not spicy, floral, herb-like, or overly medicinal, and I'm also grateful it's not long-lasting.  My spouse said, "It feels nice, non-greasy, and unobjectionable".  But something about Baxter's Night Cream AHA is bothering my eyes, causing unusual dryness and minor stinging.  This happens even though I apply the product far, FAR from my eyes and even if I just put it on the back of my hand.  So I started looking into the list of ingredients, which I included below.  Some compounds - such as certain fatty alcohols - may be derived from animals or plants.  BOC makes no claim that the Night Cream AHA is vegan, so there is no reason to expect that it is.  Other ingredients like hydrogenated polyisobutene have used animals in testing (and yes, there were deaths).  Still others - sorbitan stearate, glyceryl stearate, and cetyl alcohol - have been considered toxic and environmentally dangerous in Canada.  Then there are the four (FOUR) parabens, i.e. preservatives, recently associated with breast tumors.  Granted, parabens have not been found to _cause_ cancer, and they can exist naturally in some foods (grapes, flaxseed) and even show up in some OTC pain relievers.  But Denmark has seen fit to ban butylparaben from certain child-oriented products.  The fact that BOC chooses to use FOUR parabens is worrisome.  This uneasy ingredient list, along with no visible results except for the dry, stinging eyes, makes me happier to just do without BOC right now.  It was a nice-to-have that was nice to try, but ultimately it might not be so nice to Earth and animals.  Humans included.  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  Ingredients  Water (Aqua), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycolic Acid, PEG-100 Stearate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Benzophenone-3, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Dipalmitoyl Hydroxyproline, Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Propylene Glycol, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Wheat Amino Acids, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Propylparaben, Fragrance (Parfum), Blue 1 (CI 42090), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).	-1
Other reviewers commented that this product was very thick - and they did not mean that in a good way.  I'm not sure I'd call it very thick. It seemed more sticky than thick to me. Very hard to massage into the skin. Seemed almost as if the components were not well mixed. I did not like it.  I might try to add some water and/or other moisturizer and see if that improves the situation, rather than throw the tube away, but I don't think I'd recommend it to others.	-1
Smells nice but made my skin too oily...  Not sure if it was Pevonia's toner or this cream, or the combination of both, but my skin didn't like the ingredients and reacted adversely.	-1
Pevonia moisturizers are great, but the peels are not that effective.	-1
I used the 3 piece kit and did not see substantial results on my skin. I have acne prone skin.	-1
This stuff gave me a terrible rash on my chest. Definitely not for use if you have sensitive skin. I started out using it every day. Then went to once every other day. Rash didn't start to clear up until I stopped use altogether.	-1
I've bought several of the NIA skin care products; I bought this product from a medi spa where these products were really being pushed. I applied it exactly as directed and a few hours later broke out in pus-filled hives to all areas applied to...decolletage & throat,hands,forearms,neck and lower face. Now you may think...maybe it was something else that made the hives pop up? ...but the thing was you could actually see exactly where my hands & fingers had applied it to my skin and it happened 2 x's, the first time I was not sure it was this product,Sun Damage Repair Decolletage & Hands...but you could see the trail of where my hand & fingers had applied it...all red w/ small pustule-like bumps/hives...it left brown spots after healing. It left my skin damaged w/ brown spots where the pustules/hives had been...now I have to do TCA peels to remove the brown scarring I was left with. I will not use this again and I'm using up other NIA24 products and going back to exclusively to Perricone. I am ok with some of the other NIA24 products but they do seem to contain high amounts of waxy substances that leave a residue on my facial skin. Not just disappointed with this...upset!	-1
Not a huge fan.  I don't like the smell of this cream.  It is rich and works OK, but I prefer other products that I currently have/use.  This one I used on really dry skin and it kinda burned.  I will not use it again.	-1
While I was placing a few orders on Amazon my friend asked if I could order her the trial size Vichy since she doesn't have prime.long story short when I took it out of the padded envelope the top was not only cracked but also it was completely off. This wasn't sealed and most of the product was in the envelope! Threw it away and will not repurchase.	-1
Below average moisturizer! How can they get away with false advertising? If I could get my money back I would!	-1
Well it feels nice :) But I have very sensitive skin and it made me break out right away...first night. I wish I could use it...smells great, feels great...but pimples :)	-1
No hold, not happy at all with this product.	-1
I originally wrote a good review for this product as it seemed to diminish wrinkles, however be aware:  I went to my dermatologist showed her attached pic and she also had recent pics of my neck.  She said there's a chemical that decreases fatty tissues which is why it's not recommended for face.  She suggested I use remaining product for my elbows, knew, and buttocks.  I have a Long, thin neck with little fatty tissues.  I'm now paying for Fraxell to go back to where I was before Nectifirm.	-1
Its smooth and feels good and has a mild nice fragrance but it has done nothing and I'm not surprised. Nothing is going to fix creapy necks. Wishful thinking is so expensive. Things that work best for me are specific  neck exercise to create bloodflow, stay away from prolonged sunshine , watch your posture and eat healthy fats...We're all different and we all will age but let's do it slowly!	-1
I bought this at the dermatology clinic and tried it for 8 weeks ......nothing changed nothing Im 55 and my neck looks the same, very disappointing! It is good as a moisturizer and thats it.	-1
Been using 2 times per day for 2 months with no visible changes. Will try a different brand.	-1
I used 2 jars of this and did not see much of a difference.  Maybe a teeny bit but not enough to continue using.  Maybe had I discovered this years ago and incorporated it into my routine it would make a difference but I think genetics win in my case.  Product goes on smooth and has not much scent so it's nice, but just didn't seem to work for me.	-1
I saw no improvement which was a big disappointment....it is a little tacky to put on but I wish I had improvement..hope others do since I know everyone is different when it comes to topicals	-1
I was disappointed in how this cream performed based on the price I had to pay at the "Cosmetic Dermatologist's" office! It was $68 for 1.7 oz of the Revision Nectifirm cream, and unfortunately I saw NO difference in my neck what so ever!  I really, really wanted the Nectifirm to work! I'm an otherwise young looking woman, and was horrified when my neck seemed to lose the elasticity it had previously had after I lost some weight. I have a small area between my chin and neck that I've tried everything on, but I suppose when the priorities in life are taken care of, if I still have that small problem area I can have some type of skin treatment.  Anyway, my BIG complaint isn't with the cream, or the manufacturer, it's with the doctor! She sold me the cream, but didn't tell me you had to use it in a particular way! I just happened to be on YouTube one day and happened to find a Necktifirm video! They had a method for using the cream, and it was very specific. I was 1/2 way though the cream, and used the remainder the way it was prescribed in the video, but didn't feel I'd really know if I'd have had any better benefit if I'd have used the cream in the specified way the entire time.  Even though I didn't know there was a process to using the cream, I had to assume I wouldn't have seen any further improvement with the first 1/2 jar, and just chalked it up to live and learn! I've tried many creams and lotions... I have no problems with them as long as they smell good and absorb well - in other words they don't just sit on top of my skin if they're supposed to soak in with their special "nanosphooses" or "hydrofloofers". If I'm paying more than drug store price for some newly discovered chemical complex or supposed stem cell therapy, I want to "SEE" a pleasant difference, as well as feel a nice difference!  The doctor told me this is the only cream that has been FDA approved to lift and improve the skin tone of the aging neck. I don't know whether or not that's true, and I won't take her word for it, or base my review on what she's said.  I can only say that the cream had a very light pleasant scent and felt very nice, absorbing well and quickly. Based on this I would recommend the cream, but based on lifting and firming of the neck, I can't recommend it.  I will continue to look, and would appreciate hearing about anyone else's experiences with products that do work really well on the neck for lifting and tightening the skin.	-1
Broke out.	-1
I love all coola products. This however had the consistency of the correct product but felt like it had sand in it.... it felt like an exfoliating scrub. I tried to use it as long as I could but my face was raw after a few days. I will continue to buy my coola products directly from birchbox as to avoid wasting money.	-1

ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.  SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin's DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.  I make my own sunscreen as well as I purchase sunscreen for times when I do not have time to make any since I need to surf. For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection. The more zinc, the more protection but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to EVCO. Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun. For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high zinc oxide is the best solution. A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful ingredients, certified organic at least 95% and FREE OF; fragrances, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, or UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane.	-1
I love PCA products and have mild rosacea that worsens at times with redness on my cheeks and red bumps. I wanted this serum to work - but I used the entire bottle and saw no difference - and sometimes the serum stung a bit going on. I believe in giving all products - no matter what they are - 90 days to assess. So, I"m on my second bottle - and will determine if it's worth repurchasing. But I think my best bet is to invest in laser therapy for the redness - and no serum or cream has worked for me. The thing I do like about it - is that it gives some moisturization to my dry skin.	-1
They have a great thing going with this cleansing cream, you have to use twice or three times what they suggest.  It does not lather at all.  I will not buy it again.	-1
Too rough for my sensitive skin...	-1
The size of the brush I received was somewhere between a small and a medium sized brush - not even close to an XL.	-1
Did nothing for me. I have curly frizzy hair.  No help from this product.	-1
didnt work for me moving on from Mario Badescu tried multiple products nothing worked!	-1
Does not work as well on break-outs as thought.	-1
I've heard very good things about this brand, and was excited to try this cleanser. I'm at the nuisance age of enjoying periodic acne along with mild wrinkles, so I keep looking for solutions for the former that don't exacerbate the latter (dry skin makes the wrinkles look worse, for those not yet familiar with the pattern). This cleanser is not going to stay in my arsenal.  Pros: 1. Only need to use a small amount, which should make the very small bottle last longer 2. Rinses clean, without residue 3. Doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin 4. Doesn't seem to strip my skin, but leaves it feeling clean 5. Doesn't dry my skin to make the wrinkles look worse  Cons: 1. Doesn't do much other than clean. I didn't notice any effect other than the mental one from the "cooling action" of the menthol. I got zero benefit from using this other than the "cleansing" part. 2. Not suitable for removing makeup. This is definitely a cleanser to be used strictly for a makeup-free face. Even when I used it after removing my makeup (with Neutrogena wipes, which are the best I've found so far), I still needed another cleanser for traces of eye makeup since I'm not putting menthol around my eyes. 3. Doesn't foam. It's more of a watery gel, like inexpensive liquid hand soap. That means it's also kind of runny, so applying it in the shower meant it ran into my eyes if I wasn't careful. Note that this is only because I let it sit on my skin for several seconds to try to get some benefit from the salicylic acid. This approach is NOT suggested on the packaging, so I can't fault Obagi for it. I do wish it had a thicker consistency, though, so the salicylic acid could sit and have time to do something. 4. Expensive. Considering the tiny bottle size and minimal effects (and the need for something else to remove makeup), the price tag seems very high. I've used drug store cleansers that were on par with this one for a fraction of the cost. If I'm spending more, I'd rather invest in Algenist or La Mer cleansers, which don't claim to do anything for acne, but do clean my skin beautifully (including eye makeup).  Overall, I'm sad to say I can't recommend this cleanser.	-1
I am a cosmetic and bath junkie, but also care about what ingredients are in my products.  I was concerned that Petrolatum is the 2nd ingredient listed.  I googled Petrolatum and what I read, confirmed my fears.  I just wish they'd not use Petrolatum as the 2nd ingredient after sugar :(	-1
Don't like that Petrolatum is the 2nd ingredient.  Wish they'd use a better product as part of the base.  There are so many wonderful skin-loving, nourishing oils and butters out there, but I am just not thrilled about the Petrolatum being the main ingredient (other than sugar)	-1
I have been married for close to 24 years, and hubby has always used Edge Sensitive Gel, no matter what razor. But after my great experience with a Vichy facial serum, he figured that it was worth trying this. He used it once and tossed it. His skin was irritated, especially his neck, which was scraped and red, and his shave was not as close with the same razor.	-1
I use shaving soap and a brush/mug when I'm home.  This is a high quality, inexpensive system, but it doesn't travel well.  On the road, I generally use a can of gel, which is more expensive, messier, and slower than a brush and soap.  This stuff is more expensive than gel, doesn't lubricate as well, and is more difficult to apply because it doesn't "stick" as easily to wet skin.  I give it two stars because I'm going to use the rest of the can, but I sure won't be buying any more.	-1
Came and the bottle was smashed up and it was empty.	-1
I was soo disappointed with this OPI product. My nail polish chipped worse than if I'd not used anything at all. It didn't seem to work as a base OR top coat effectively. I was able to get a refund - thank goodness at $14 for one tiny bottle!	-1
The polish is okay but the brush separated from the cap the second time I opened it.  Now the black cap twists off and I have to use an instrument or pliers to remove the brush from the polish.	-1
This stuff is seriously awful. I was looking for a change from ORLY top to bottom because of its bluish tone and bought this. I didn't need to straighten my nails, but thought that something extra is always a plus. Now I'm ready to cry... I used it only one time and six of my nails broke. My nail polish started chipping after one day of wear. It was chipping with upper part of my nails. Now I have cracked, damaged awful nails that I haven't had in years. This product can't be called nail straightener it should be called nail killer! DON'T BUY IT!	-1
I bought this at Ulta, even though the Amazon price was much less. I can't recommend it! First of all, it's somewhat underpowered for anyone with thick hair. Second, the curl-release feature worked less than half the time and I wound up having to physically untangle and pull my hair out of the plastic bristle brush. Third, the "cap" that holds the plastic brush on the base, flew off almost right away and I had to search the bathroom for it and screw it back on. It is not an expensive product, but it's not even worth what it cost. It's a "cheap" product in a number of ways.	-1
Doesnt work	-1
These just really didn't work for me. I have diffuse thinning--not the worst out there, but quite noticeable. Sprinkling the fibers just caused them to kind of bunch up and clump, so it was really obvious there was something unsavory going on on my scalp. If you sweat a little bit or scratch your head, the fibers will really turn into clumps. I'm glad this works for other people, but I don't really want anyone to be able to tell that I'm hiding my thin hair behind some powder.	-1
This might work well for others, but this brand made my scalp incredibly irritated.  Also, the color has a greenish tinge, which was NOT the look I was going for.  Nanogen and Cobuki have worked better for me.	-1
I got this in light brown.  I have slight hair loss from a medication I was taking, at my crown.  This looks like dirt, & sucks the shine from my hair wherever it falls.  The color is not even remotely brown or light brown.  More grayish black brown. I gave it 2 stars because I like the shake it on container.	-1
It's like sprinkling salt or pepper on your head and expecting it to look like hair...Don't bother purchasing.	-1
the container is too small ,,, it is much smaller then the applicator, so i cannot use it at all	-1
OK THE REASON I AM GIVING TOPPIK ONE STAR IS BECAUSE I BEEN BUYINGTHIS PRODUCT ALL THE TIME AND I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT. IT USE TO BE ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET. NOW, THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT IN THE MARKET. LATELY AFTER U PUT THE MEDIUM BROWN IN UR HAIR AND THEN U PUT THE SPRAY ON TOP OF IT, YOUR HAIR BECOMES PURPLE ON THE AREA WHERE UR HAIR IS THINNING BUT THE REST STAYS BROWN AND IT LOOKS GROSS AND DISGUSTING. I CALLED THE MANUFACTURE AND I SPOKE WITH THE MANAGER AND I SENT THEM PICTURES, THEY RESPONDED SAYING THAT THE BOTTLE THAT I BOUGHT MUST BE DMAGED AND THEY SENT ME A NEW ONE. I GAVE THEM A CHANCE AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND OH LORD IT WAS JUST HORRIBLE!!!!!! I WENT AND I BOUGHT NEW BOTTLE FROM SALLY BEAUTY AND IT WAS THE SAME THING. THATS ITTTTTTTTTT. I AM NOT BUYING THIS RODUCT EVER AGAIN	-1
Makes the spot you are covering look dry and dull.  Not a natural look. I will not buy this again.	-1
Saw on Dr. Oz so ordered it. Very disappointed though. Did not fill in at all. Made no difference. Would return if it wasn't such a hassle.	-1
Color is way lighter then posted.	-1
For a few more dollars I could've gotten a much BIGGER bottle!!!!!!!! Content amount is Not worth it!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a rip off to buy this item for that amount	-1

I have ordered Toppik before and it must have been the real thing because it worked better. This one is like dust and doesn't look like hair at all. I recommend trying another product on Amazon. Perhaps the price has something to do with this but it is not the Toppik brand and does not work as well.	-1
I think the color did not match my hair correctly.  If I order another one, it will probably be the medium brown instead of the light brown.	-1
shows like I have put dried mustard in my hair. After a couple of hours, it's gone. Will not try again.	-1
It takes too long to cover the patches. The colour was too dark for brown. It was like black. It cannot be used for large areas of baldness.	-1
I have some thinning in my part, and have been using Joan River's Great Hair Day for years. It gives a slight itch sometimes but is easy to brush on and gives full coverage. I bought the Toppik after reading reviews of no itch and how it works better than Great Hair Day. I kept shaking it on my head and it didn't look like the powder even came out. Then I slowly see a pile of powder forming on my hair, and I had to mix it in with my fingers. I even tried using the Great Hair Day brush, to no avail - the brush didn't pick up on the Toppik powder. I used the Toppik applicator for parts which I bought seperately, but that didn't work well either. I'm back to using Great Hair Day and the Toppik is sitting ignored in my closet.	-1
My husband has been using Toppik for awhile now. It is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots. My husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head, which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair. And in the sun, it actually turns a pinkish red (he uses dark brown)! The claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie. Even with a bit of wind or humidity, the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face, making it look like tar. It leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets. I would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity because my husband truly believes that I still don't know that he uses the product! Toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair. Using Toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind, constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product, and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place. Instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it doesn't even bother me, my husband constantly obsesses over his hair. Instead of enhancing his look, Toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place. Instead of boosting his confidence, Toppik has made him even more insecure about losing his hair.	-1

I didn't like this product at ALL.  It clumped when I put it on.  I will never buy it again.	-1
I'm in my early 30's and have a receding hairline. You ever sleep with hairspray on your hair and to wake up next morning with linty hair? That's exactly how I would describe the texture when you use this on your hair. I purchased color black with the pump sprayer, pick/comb, and their hairspray. I accidently sprayed the toppik powder onto my scalp and noticed the toppik color was more like dark purple. It takes a while to perfect the use of the pump to get the right amount of Toppik sprayed only onto the hair. No matter how perfect your results come out, up real close you can notice something different and I'm sure under the direct sunlight it's probably 10X more noticeable. Toppik claims that people can't even notice 2 inches away, that's bull. This is definitely a better product than Couvre the scalp concealer. Toppik hairspray is like any other strong hold hairspray, absolutely nothing advanced or special about it. The comb is a piece of crap, made out of cheap paper/plastic not even worth a quarter! Go to a dollar store and find yourself a better comb. Toppik comes off easily so avoid moisture even your sweat, wind, and any objects & elements disrupting the do. The money and the time you have to spend to get a half decent look in my honest opinion is not worth it. I rather deal with a wearing a hat then worrying about an embarrassing toppik malfunction. Maybe if you're in your 60's and not as concerned about the natural look then more power to you, but I still think people are over paying for a product that doesn't promise what they claim. I'm currently trying a product called NuHair. I'm taking the vitamin and using their hair serum. I'm only on the second month and hoping to see some results within the next few months. There are no cheap quick fixes that lasts forever so I'm going to commit to this NuHair program for 5-6 months and hope for the best. Figure hair transplant takes up to 6 months anyways so might as well give the natural method a 6 month commitment. If the natural way fails then Rogaine is a possibility and then hair transplant. Bottom line, my girlfriend thinks I wasted my money on this product (toppik) and I'm going to have to agree with her on this. Hope you guys learn from my mistake. If you guys know of any good hair transplant doctors in the bay area CA let me know. Good luck fellas.	-1
I wanted to like this product. I had read about it on a site other than Amazon. I was looking for a good product for my oily hair.  This product was so watery that I couldn't get it from my hands to my hair no matter how hard I tried.  I tried to use it several times, but I finally gave up and threw it away.	-1
Hair gel products are hit and miss with me. My hair is very thin with no wave so its anyones guess whether a product will be effective with me. I ordered  this product because I really liked Baxter's facial mask. The bad news is this product just didn't work for me. It is very greasy no matter how little you happen to use. I tried it several different ways and it just came up short. This is not to say the product might not be great on someone else. It just didn't work for me.	-1
I couldn't wait to get this lip butter after hearing so many people rave about how good they were.  I must say I wasn't impressed, especially for the price!  I will stick to my nivea lip butters	-1
I did not like this face wash and was pretty disappointed because I am a huge La Roche-Posay fan. Their other products have really impressed me but this face wash burned my eyes so badly  even without getting it directly in them, just in the normal course of washing my face.  It also left my skin really really clean which may sound great but I couldn't help but feel it was stripping my skin of every single bit of moisture.  I swear my skin would make a squeaking noise when I rubbed my finger over it after using this.  So, no thank you, I would like to keep my moisture barrier.  Note:  I also tried the Purifying Foaming Cream Cleanser and it felt exactly the same.	-1
BURNED my skin, turned it red, acne and overall skin condition worsened overnight, after just ONE use. Continued use was a HUGE mistake. Took my skin a long time to recover.	-1
Another reviewed nailed it when she said the color is not what I expected.  Jasmine looks pink online so what a surprise to see a flesh-colored balm.  It is a truly hideous color on me and one that I never would've ordered if there was even a hint in the description that it would be flesh-toned.  I can't see that there's a way to salvage this color so will just toss it.  Money wasted.  So disappointed.	-1
Made lips burn. Yipes! Usually Korres is more gentle!	-1
Personally I don't find that this gives lasting moisture to my lips. And as a lip butter you'd think it would more so than a regular balm. However I do enjoy it when it is on my lips, it smells great, but this is just doesn't do it what it is supposed to. I didn't give it one star because it isn't horrible.	-1
I was really excited to try this product because of all the good reviews on it, but I was really disappointed. I get horribly dry lips if I'm not careful enough and I read on sites and heard tons of great reviews for this product. Now, this may just be from the color of the Guava flavor, but when I applied it to my lips it made them look even drier. However the product itself, ignoring the color, did not improve my chapped lips at all. I'm still trying to use it and see if it works better on lips that aren't dry, but so far I'm having the same issue.  I wouldn't totally dismiss the idea of it, however. I may try it in another color to see if it was just the pale one that made my flaky lips stand out.	-1
Ive been using this product for almost 10 years and this batch has no expiration date and has a different fragrance	-1
It made me break out, especially my chin area .  To be fair though, I have very sensitive, acne prone skin.  However, I do recommend their Bioglycolic cleanser which really helps to exfoliate.	-1
Great product.	-1
Doubtful of authenticity think it's fake	-1
I knew that this product would not be without some tingling due to the acid, but I found it very uncomfortable. Also I did not find it very effective as well as it left my cuticles even drier than they were before.	-1
I purchased this product when I read a review on Amazon.com.  Well, I do not find it as amazing as the reviewer did.  I hardly use it now.  I love the Butter London products, but this is not my favorite.	-1
I didn't think I would HATE a polish, but I do.  It streaked terribly when I was applying it and though the color is gorgeous in the bottle, it is not pretty on.  It looked thick and it chipped quickly.  I have several other butter London polishes and I love them so I am incredibly disappointed in Goss.	-1
I really should have gone to the store rather than trusting how colors would translate from online to in person.  Since I'm a fan of butter London, it seemed like a safe gamble.  Wow was I wrong.  The color Dahling (such a fun name, like all their colors) looks *nothing* like the photo.  I thought it was going to be a delicious medium sherberty pink and it's actually rather dowdy,  a matronly mauvey pink.  Sad.	-1
Very disappointed. It may be 7-free but it's rated a "6" on EWG. Ugh! I was going to go back to Essie (rated a 5 with EWG Skin Deep) but will try Zoya (5-free) because of all the good things I read about it. It was 1 of only 2 out of the 12 nail polishes tested that were really free of the toxic chemicals they claimed.	-1
The quality is poor and it's too expensive.	-1
Wears off and chips easily - lasts about 2 days.	-1
Wears off and chips easily - lasts about 2 days.	-1
Too thick to apply properly.  Wouldn't buy again.	-1
These polishes are expensive and too thin for the color to pop. I bought several because the colors are so beautiful but have returned to old faithful OPI.	-1
After seeing British Racing Green swatched all over the Internet, I finally gave in and bought it. Unfortunately, for me it's been the same story s with a lot of other very dark colours: out of bright light, it just looks like black. I found it really annoying that once I'd put on enough to reach a good opacity, you really couldn't tell it was green. Since then, this expensive product has just sat in my drawers. I can't recommend this colour, but Butter London's Come to Bed Red is a staple for my nails. It's great!	-1
The glitter is exact and too much so, one looks as if one has sparkly fungi on one's nails.  There are better.	-1
Hideous.  Butter London is a high quality lacquer but every once in a while the colours are not true.  This is an example of a lacquer gone bad.	-1
I was so excited to pick out my very first bottle of Butter 3-free nail polish. There were many gorgeous colors to choose from. I chose this one (Kerfuffle)...and I wish I hadn't. It didn't go on very nicely. It was obvious I couldn't even possibly get by temporarily with one coat. But mostly it reminds me of a colored "White-Out" I used years ago at my job. Every time I look down at my toes, I cringe because it's obvious I won't be happy until I remove it and put something else on.  I would be willing to try another color by this brand, but I can't recommend this one.	-1
I bought this brand of polish because of the healthier ingredients. I also bought the base and top coats by Butter London ($29.99 for both) and followed exact instructions. I used a base coat, 2 coats of polish and top coat. Less than 24 hours later, it's chipped dramatically all over. Unfortunately, I can't return these products because of Amazon's return policy of hazardous materials i.e. nail polish.	-1
See description above. The London Butter nail lacquer that I purchased from their company is 100% fantastic!!  But, the London Butter nail lacquer that I purchased  from Shop Adorn was disgusting!!	-1
I loved the color of this nail polish when I first bought it.  However, after applying two coats it was a disastrous mess.  The ending result was thick, streaky and looked as if I applied 5 coats.  When dried it was so unattractive, it had to be removed straight away.  Not worth $14.00!	-1
I bought three different colors of this dreamy looking nail polish and used them as stocking stuffers (including my own!)  The sheen is lovely, but the polish chips easily, and can't be worn without a topcoat, as even two coats won't stand up to normal wear and tear for even a day.	-1
Was hoping this was gonna be great but was let down   this eye cream was really hard for my skin to absorb and then it dried out my eye area so much my skin started to get irritated and flake off  don't bother trying it youall just waste $ and regret it. I have a whole jar left so maybe Ill try using this as a neck cream ...	-1
Despite the small size, this product lasts for a long time because a little of it goes a very long way. I find that it sinks in very quickly too, which is nice in the morning for under concealer. But I don't find that this product has any noticeable different on my under eye area.	-1
This is a drugstore quality cream. Does nothing, not particularly moisturizing. Cheap packaging.	-1
I like this brand, but not this particular cream.  It didn't really absorb into my skin, but just sat on top of it feeling greasy ... while at the same time leaving my skin feeling dry.  I had to blend it with some argan oil to keep my skin from feeling dry.	-1
Expected more.  Irritated my skin.  Smelled chemically.	-1
Doesn't wash off makeup, leaves my face feeling dirty and like I haven't washed it yet. Very weird smell too, and you need a lot for each application. Not for me. Would not buy again.	-1
I love this brand but this product doesnt qork with my skin. So sad. I tried it three times and everytime vroke out really badly after each use. Made my skin soft though.	-1
The gel burnt under my eyes. It got slightly swollen under there as well. Use with caution	-1
This stuff makes me greasy and I break out when I use it.	-1
I wasn't a fan of this cleanser at all. It's gooey, messy, and feels like cement mix. Also there are many black specs in it that sticks to everything, and not just your skin. These black specs will stick to your sink or shower. The consistency here is not pleasurable and I would old good old fashioned soap instead. A big pass here.  Katiebabs	-1
I am a fan of Mario Badescu products.  I have recommended them to clients with skin sensitivities and in most cases they have been very happy with their performance.  Once in a while, however, I come across a product which I am not as fond of.  This, unfortunately, happens to be one of them.  WHAT IS THIS CLEANSER LIKE? A nice sized bottle, I do like the color of the cleanser.  It reminds me of pistachio ice cream.  The texture of the cleanser is very creamy and thick.  It has tiny flecks of dark green in it which is the seaweed.  The fragrance is a touch overwhelming for me, however.  I am not sure what it is.  It just is not a smell that I enjoy a whole lot.  The label stays on and does not come off like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mario-Badescu-The-Moisture-Magnet-SPF-15-2-oz/dp/B0015Z532O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mario Badescu The Moisture Magnet SPF 15, 2 oz.</a>.  HOW DOES THIS CLEANSING SOAP PERFORM? A little goes  along way of this stuff.  It is thick and creamy and a delightful green color.  The cream smears around on the skin nicely and when adding a little bit of water to it, it does foam up some, but is not really sudsy like some soaps can be.  It does make skin soft at first, but then I feel as if the skin is too stripped.  The time that I am testing this in is a time of humidity and more oiliness and this cleanser is stripping my skin already- in winter, I am thinking it will be way too much for me to use.  I have normal to dry skin.  I have had my daughter test it.  She said it was nice at first but felt it stripped her skin a bit too much.  In both cases, the skin surface felt smooth, although dry and tight.  I have not had the men try it yet- they don't like to try new products. It is hard to pin them down.  THE WORST PART- ITCHING The worst part about this cleanser is that it made our skin itch a bit.  Perhaps it was from drying it out so much or maybe the sodium laureth sulfate it contains, but it just makes the skin feel uncomfortable.  No matter how much lotion I apply, it does not seem to soothe this feeling entirely.  THE BOTTOM LINE Great sized bottle, lovely texture and green color, this soap seemed promising.  Creamy and easy to use without being overly foamy, I found the fragrance to be a bit overwhelming and it left our skin stripped and a bit itchy and uncomfortable and tight.  I have given this one star.  If you have very oily skin and perhaps don't mind it being a strong cleanser, then perhaps you would like it.  For us, it really is rough on our skin and it just leaves us too uncomfortable to rate it higher than that.	-1
I have purchased Mario Badescu products in the past.  This Seaweed Cleansing Soap, I didn't like the scent, I felt like I was putting a salad on my face, which I didn't like the little pieces in the cleansing soap, plus it really left my skin feeling clean, but overly clean, stripped, not feeling soft.  They say on the bottle that it's suitable for all skin types, which is kind of subjective to me.  Yes I want my face to feel clean when Iam using a cleansing product, but I don't like it feeling stripped. This also left my facial skin looking red, which really surprised me.  Not sure if Iam allergic to an ingredient in it or not.  Live and learn!	-1
I really wanted to like this cleanser. I mean the name of it just sounds amazing. Upon opening it, there's no seal on it. The smell is not too bad. It's a pleasant smell but definitely a little bit artificial. There are little bits of pieces in this to help exfoliate the skin. I have used it for a few days now - hoping for what happened the first time was a fluke but I think I am allergic to something in this because every time I used it, my skin would break out. I have not had as much break out as when I was a teenager - over 15 years ago.  I tried going back to my usual cleaner and noticed that my skin was a lot less irritated. So there's something in this making my skin irritated and I don't even have super sensitive skin. I have combination skin and as nice as this smells, it didn't work for me.	-1
This is a cucumber scented, 4% rubbing alcohol solution. Yes, that means it is 96% water. Save yourself some money and skip this.	-1
Makes my skin break out	-1
Doesn't Smell good.  Burns and makes skin angry.  Would not recommend.	-1
This would be my first feedback on Amazon. This junk does not work. It smells horrific, used it enough to see results happen. They never did. My skin got worse . Would never purchase again. Wasted my money.	-1
I am not happy with the product because it isn't the item I actually wanted to buy... I meant to purchase the Pevonia RS2 Lotion ( I don't use the cleanse) but your company won't let me return & exchange it for the correct one.	-1
Maybe I just got a bad or old batch, but this smelled sour when I received it. Returned!	-1
This item arrived without any kind of packaging...  This lotion/toner did not work well with my combination skin type...  Not sure if the lactic acid was the culprit or not, but I would not purchase this again.	-1
I bought this product because it is listed as a lotion for rosacea, and dry, sensitive skin. It is not a lotion. It is a non aerosole spray of very watery, milky liquid. I am returning this, and would not purchase this again. I also don't like the vendors return policy of return within 7 days of purchase, less restocking fee. The return time expires before the product is received, Ridiculous.	-1
The sprayer is not a very fine mist...and it's too expensive.	-1
Not authentic! Does not work like the real ones! Piece of junk	-1
love Mario Badescu products but this one made me break out!	-1
Despite the name saying oil control, this lotion is VERY oily. So oily, in fact, that when I squeeze it out, only oil comes out. I have tried shaking and massaging the bottle, and it still is separated. I am so frustrated this is a poor product. I'm obsessed with the Mario Badescu line so I'm assuming this is a very old product that the seller tried to pass off. If it wasn't such a pain to return it, I would have. It's just went in the trash after 4 or 5 tries. What a waste	-1
I bought this because of the good reviews. Didn't work for me at all. Left me with blurry vision. Other cleansing oils work far better and can be used for the entire face.	-1
UPDATE: At first I loved the texture of this product, but it makes me break out horribly. I stopped using it for about a month and my skin improved. I used it twice in the last week and I'm breaking out like crazy again.  I gave it to my boyfriend and it seems to work well for his (less sensitive) skin. I'm disappointed and will not buy it again.	-1
Supposed to help with my type of skin. Does the opposite. I got itchy and broke out all over using this. It smells nice though. I wouldn't use it again. I have sensitive/combo skin.	-1
This made my chest and back acne worse than I've seen it in a long time. Granted, maybe my body had already planned to freak out in acne before I started using this. However, it did nothing to help the situation. I also made the mistake of using this on my lady parts which proved quite irritating. Ps the smell was not good.	-1
Did not do anything special for my KP otherwise a nice soap but overpriced for what it doesn't do	-1
Looks pretty, pink, and creamy with strawberry seeds as described.  Expected a lovely strawberry smell, but just smelled like lotion.  Also felt like a cream lotion.  Did nothing at all.  Followed up with my clean and clear scrub to get the job done.	-1
Makes my skin feel dry and itchy	-1
The mask feels slightly tacky and I didn't notice any real difference in my skin after. I was scared I would break out but didn't. I wouldn't recommend the mask, although I usually love this brand	-1
drys.  tightened? in dry sense only	-1
Warning. This product contains peanut oil. Not only does it not work, it could kill someone with a peanut allergy. Great job, Mario.	-1
Came inside a plastic bag with half the bottle spilled everywhere and the box came wet. My rose water and cucumber water ugh. Next time Im not buying this online anymore the kids weren't even full screwed on.  I ordered rose water, cucumber water, glycolic toner and orange cleansing soap and 3 out of 4 bottles cake leaking. Horrible only the orange cleansing soap didn't leak because its ticker formula	-1
I was disappointed by this. I have an enzyme cleanser by another brand and it does a great job at exfoliating dry skin. I thought that's what enzymes did -- not the Mario Badescu gel: my skin is still dry and flaky. It doesn't foam, which I could live with, but I also can't see it on my skin so it's hard to tell if I've thoroughly covered my face. It does have a great smell and a cooling sensation, though I don't want cooling in the winter time. I also still got zits while using this, so this product is useless to me. (But I appreciate receiving this as a free promotional gift as I had been intending to buy it.)	-1
Some other reviewer said it felt like spreading yogurt on your face.  That's true, and like yogurt it's not going to take your makeup off. Be prepared to wash your face a second time with something else.  Nobody's got time for that, or at least I don't.  No noticeable improvement.	-1
This product is alright but i don't think my skin like ita very much	-1
didnt work for me burned my skin moving on from Mario Badescu tried multiple products nothing worked!	-1
This candle smells like your eccentric old aunt's guest room. You know--the one who uses scented sachets in the bureau drawers and feeds you expired biscuits for tea.	-1
Sticky. I don't like this at all. I got a spray bottle and distilled water like I have done for years. That works fine.	-1
To do all over again WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT.  Is it suppose to do anything but spray your face because you can do that with cool water & save $$	-1
I've used a full catalogue of Elemis products for over a month and am leaving reviews on each one.  Regarding the Marine Creme, I haven't found it to be of any use. Elemis boasts this as their most popular product but I can't understand why as I see no real benefit. In fact, my complexion was more congested after using this. Considering the massive price-tag, this earns it a very low rating.  I personally think Elemis reviews their own products with high marks as part of their marketing initiative because I find most of them to be shockingly overrated.	-1
Not at all what I expected, for me does not work, my face looks worse than before. I will never order again this brand.	-1
I wanted to love this, because my skin needs extra moisture once I've applied my make up and throughout the day. However, if you have sensitive skin, this will more than likely irritate your skin. I rarely break out anymore but something in the ingredients clogged my pores & caused me to have a horrible acne breakout all over my face.	-1
Originally, I loved this iron. However, after a couple of months, it stopped working properly. The light flashes and doesn't heat continually, so it was definitely faulty. I contacted the seller and they said they could do nothing about it. So, it was a waste of money.	-1
I read all the 5 star reviews on this curling iron and I went for it.  I now regret the purchase, while it does get hot, it does not get hot enough for my hair. I also don't recommend this size for loose fat Victorias secret curls. Go with the 1 1/4, and also a different brand. I have heard many good things about Hot tools, but I cannot recommend this curling iron for thick coarse hair. (I can't speak for thin hair)	-1
Something isn't right about the hot tools on here.	-1
There are two major drawbacks to this flat iron. 1) the outside casing gets extremely hot - hot enough to burn your fingers when you clamp it down and 2) it does not have an automatic turn-off. Frankly, I've switched back to my $30 Remington flat iron. This is just not worth the price.	-1
after just 3 years the wire came loose in the handle and now blinks on and off. Poor design!!!	-1
At first this was great - heated up nicely and made great curls.  But less than a month later, it doesn't heat up well at all; I thought I accidentally changed the temp setting but it was on the highest setting and doesn't do a thing.  Too late to return it, I wasted 30 bucks.  Don't make the same mistake I did!	-1
Great brand but the clamp crimped my hair so badly I returned it and ended up buying another one without it.	-1
This product makes my hair stiff and dry and crunchy.  It also made the ends look frizzy.	-1
The heat on this flat iron seems less than the babyliss I owned before (pink for breast awareness). I don't know if I got a bad batch but I will work around it to get the results I need.	-1
Get's hot quick, but does not curl my hair. I have a older one that takes forever to get hot but when it does, it gives me a tight curl, but for some reason no matter how long i keep this iron in my hair, i can't get a curl.	-1
Didn't not work at all didn't get warm at all! Do not buy save your money and buy a NuMe wand instead!	-1
works amazingly. This is my second one. the first one broke after 5 years of use. it makes my hair so shiny... Update: Bought my second one through amazon and it broke less than one year.. The barrel does NOT heat up anymore ... Makes me question the quality control ...	-1
I returned this item as it didn't work after one use. I've had this brand before, really liked it so I was very disappointed. Also the design was different. For the money I expected much better.	-1
Blades do not contact properly and the handle is uncomfortable and gets WAY too hot.	-1
I normally love this curling iron, this one MUST be defective, it does not clamp shut, so therefore it does not curl properly. waste of money	-1
I tried it on the middle setting first after reading all the "my hair melted off" reviews.  Nothing impressive or scary, not even close to hot enough so cranked it up bit by bit to the highest setting.  Yes, the want was hot.  No it did nothing to curl my hair. Mind you, I had just tried the Bed Head Rock 'n' Roller Ceramic Styling Iron and while it curled (really curled) my hair, the Hot Tools one left a bit of a wave with a smidge of a curl on the end.  Meh.  Returned it.	-1
One of the draws for this iron is the static control for fine hair. It simply isn't true. I had lots of static issues with it and at this price, expected more.	-1
I love this brand of polish.  Have been using their products for years and have never been disappointed - until now!  Not only didn't it chip - HALF MY POLISH CAME RIGHT OFF!  the top half of FOUR nails were bare to the nail in less than THREE DAYS!!  So when they say no chips - they mean it - because the polish doesn't have a chance to chip!!  It just peels right off!  I will throw it out - not worth returning - but will never purchase again....  I still love their regular polishes though and will continue to use them,	-1
I have fine hair and had hoped that if I used just a real, tiny amount it would be okay, but not so at all.  No amount of this is small enough for fine hair, period.  I gave my bottle to a girl at the office who has a full head of thick medium length hair, and she really likes it, said even her husband likes it on his super long beard.  So it's a good product, obviously, just have to have the hair for it, which I do not.  Thanks!	-1
Leaves a film on my skin and actually is causing break outs due to clogged pores. This really sucks since I heard such great reviews about this product. It doesn't leave your face feeling all tight and dry, that is true, but not much consolation when you are breaking out and have clogged pores.	-1
I'm not really sure what all the hype is about with this product, but I'm happy that it turned me on to the brand.  The Mario Badescu buffering lotion, drying cream, acne cleanser, and special c clearing lotion were very effective.  I also like that the formulas are simple without a lot of extra added chemicals.  Although this particular product didn't work for me, a bunch of his other products have.  This is a great brand!	-1
I have cystic, hormonal acne and I heard that Mario Badescu products work well. I purchased this and the Buffering Lotion and the Buffering Lotion works SO much better at reducing my acne than this does. This one is messy, application is weird (you have to apply it with a qtip or something else you can dip into the sediment at the bottom of the bottle) and the ingredients are essentially calamine lotion and alcohol. It also did nothing for my acne. I know this works for many people, so Im guessing it works better for white heads and smaller breakouts, however cystic acne tends to respond better to sulphur- based products (this is definitely true for me) and the Buffering Lotion is sulphur-based.	-1
not for me. break me out so bad!!!!	-1
This product is overrated. No major improvements, little to zero...irritates my skin.	-1
I must be mutant. Nothing that works for the majority of the consumers never works for me. I used this, along with other Mario Badescu products, and nothing. I saw zero change in my face.	-1
Don't know what was the hype about all over you tube, i get occasional break out and this product did not help. I normally love Mario Badescus product and currently addicted with Cleansers and toners but drying lotion didn't was ok. Read my full review at [...]	-1
Too drying and not effective.	-1
0 effect on acnes. The stage of acne does not matter... like i did not applied anything. Origin acne spot remover is 10 times better than this one.	-1
This arrived without ANY sort of seal, it was not even in any kind of box or protective wrapper, and the product is LIQUID.	-1
After reading all the positive reviews, I was really excited to give this a try. Well, I'm sorry I did because the product didn't really work for me. It didn't shrink pimples or get rid of them. I get like 1 pimple a month and it didn't do anything to help. I would not buy this product again.	-1
Didn't work!	-1
I purchased this from Ulta. I enjoy a couple of MB other things, so gave this a try. I have sensitive, combination oily, acne prone skin. I used this item maybe 6 times during a 3 week period. I followed the directions closely, and used it on a few acne spots on my face. Out of the few, only one whitehead disappeared within a few days. I don't know if it's because of this item, or the fact that I for once didn't pick at my skin and left it alone, or that I used a Clarisonic brush on my face daily. But since the other acne spots didn't disappear either, I contribute it to the fact that I didn't mess with my face and tried very hard to keep my face clean and moisturized. I think this stuff is overpriced for the value. I have better results using drug store brands, changing pillow cases and towels every other day, and keeping my hands off my face. I returned it.	-1
it is too runny and pools in the root of the nail. color too looks like jaundice.	-1
I bought this bronzer because in the package it didn't look the least bit orange.  However, upon application it was most definitely orange.  Packaging can be deceptive!  This is disappointing because every bronzer I've tried thus far, from high end to low end, has ended up orange, if not immediately then after a few hours of wear.  I guess it is that I don't like the look of bronzer,  I prefer just blush.  What a waste of cash!  I wanted something that would sculpt my cheekbones and give me a nude look.  But it's as orange as can be and makes me look way too made up.  Now I have a somewhat expensive makeup item that I can't do a thing with.  I bought it on vacation in San Francisco and can't return it anywhere.  What a shame!  I'll find someone to give it to.  I simply have no use for yet another bronzer that's as orange as a pumpkin!  I definitely don't recommend this product.	-1
No good for medium skin color. Makes face look dirty does not help when contouring.	-1
Very drying; looks like a mask on my face.	-1
I love her products but I hate this applicator!  Its a heavy/thick puff top that have the powder feed through it...  it goes on to heavy and wipes off your other makeup -- can look cakey if you aren't careful.. I wouldnt buy this again.	-1
Too expensive. Works good but not for the price.	-1
Didn't seem to help my mild rosacea (at all) plus it caused me to break out on my nose. We are talking full on bulbous pink-white eruptions, the likes of which I haven't seen since 8th grade. For reference, I am now 42. When you have rosacea, the last thing you want to see is more pink marks on your face, no matter what their clinical description might be!  It is a decent moisturizer so I now use it as a hand cream. My hands and nails are in great condition,now, so at least this purchase wasn't a complete cash loss.	-1
I used this EXACTLY as directed with NO noticeable difference in my hair!  I was advised numerous times by my hair stylist how well this works to give my hair some shine as well as tame the frizzies.  Nadda!  This is a very high-price item to give no noticeable results.  Please save your hard-earned money.  There are plenty of other more reasonably priced products out there that do a good job. I do not recommend this product.	-1
I don't notice any difference after using this product. When I applied it as necessary the blemishes remained. I didn't feel or look any different.  And, I have to agree with other reviewers complaining about the text on the bottle. It's tiny, black print, against a frosted, dark orange glass.  It just felt like I was applying this serum in vain, and I love Juice Beauty products, too.	-1
I was looking forward to trying the Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Serum, but it isn't for me.  First of all, this is the first product that I have tried from this brand so I can't comment on how good it is in conjunction with the other products that they recommend that you use with this.  I wash my skin with Aveeno Clear Complexion foaming cleanser.  I used this afterwards.  Warning!  The instructions are printed so tiny that you will need a magnifying glass to read them!  I was extremely annoyed to have to look up the instructions online before using this.  Then I found out that there are two different versions of instructions.  The instructions on Amazon tell the user to pump the cleanser onto dry hands and massage into dry skin. Wet fingertips and massage to form an emulsion then rinse.  The instructions on the Juice Beauty website say to apply this treatment serum to entire face or just to blemished areas and then apply moisturizer.  There is no mention of forming an emulsion and rinsing it off.  Unfortunately I couldn't read the instructions on the package, so I cannot comment on what they say.  I think that this is two very different ways to use a product and one has to be wrong.  I tried the instructions from the Juice Beauty website first and I found that leaving the serum on my face made me itch.  Then I tried only applying the serum to blemishes and it had the same effect.  I then tried using the instructions from this site and rinsing it off after applying.  My skin didn't feel as itchy, but the blemishes didn't go away either.  I think that I might have a sensitivity to some ingredient in it, so my daughter is going to try it out.	-1
This serum promises to clear blemishes, hydrate, and reduce redness/inflammation.  According to the directions, you apply it to your whole face or just the blemishes after cleanser but before moisturizer.  I wasn't sure how to apply it with a dropper, so I just applied a few drops to a cotton ball and wiped it on.  While the bottle is tiny, you don't need much serum for each application (at least if you restrict yourself to the actual blemishes).  I've been applying this product for a week and it has made no change.  The few blemishes I have were as red as always and seem to be going away at the same rate they would without acne medication.  I have, at least, seen no negative results.  This works for other people, but I have seen no results.	-1
It chip My wife nails in a day. If you have a nail gel nail dryer? Then stick with or go with the gel nail polish. It last longer than this stuff.	-1
Someone was totally right that it looks like foundation. I wanted a nude with a light pink tint and this is NOT it.	-1
I have sensitive eyes. Im allergic to practically all high end mascaras and thought I should try this since it's made for sensitive eyes. It was no different. It made my eyes super itchy and made me want to pull my lashes out. I'll just stick to my cheap drugstore maybelline. Also, this stuff would begin to flake into my eyes after 4 hours of wear.	-1
Not as good as the Obagi C serum...	-1
Just didn't care for this cream. It wasn't greasy and did not have much of a smell.  I just didn't notice much difference in the morning in softness of my skin.  I think I have better luck with the Philosophy brand.	-1
This is not a lip product you can put on so quickly.  Taking time with a tiny lip brush can get it on but you have to take care to do it properly as it stains.  Secondly, it does not last all day.  Although my lips were red for hours, it was not even and it TRANSFERS to cups, glasses and even smeared onto my skin on both sides of my mouth.  I have never seen that.  NOT Good.  Don't bother.	-1
Disappointing.  This stain made my lips sore. It also didn't apply evenly or dispense well from the brush.  I love my other Stilla products but this one is a loser.	-1
This is quite possibly one of the worst lip products I have ever used. The product is very sticky, but also very thin. When I put it on my lips it all migrates to the edges and I end up looking like I had an accident with a lip liner. It feels really unpleasant on the lip. The color is pretty, but it feels gross, doesn't stay in place, and doesn't last. A big loser for me.	-1
Really thick and sticky. It also arrived in a plain tub with no label.	-1
My wife was looking forward to getting this product. However, when it arrived and she was able to get the ingredient list she decided that this would mot be what she would uses.	-1
I've been working to eliminate harsh chemicals from my skin care regime. This rating of 7 from EWG is mostly due to Fragrance and Butylated hydroxytoluene. Look it up at ewg.org. Also, many people complain that they don't like the way NIA 24 products smell. I like they way they smell, but most are too strong.	-1
While I liked the product initially because it does hydrate well something started to happen that I thought might be coincidence.  I started noticing eye bags.  I thought at first maybe I was ingesting too much salt, not hydrated, not getting enough rest, etc.  Eventually I suspected it's the NIA complex and discontinued it.  The bags started disappearing.  A month later I tried it again (new jar this time just in case) to see if this was coincidence.  They began reappearing.  I tried reducing the amount applied, and even just using it only at night.  Only when I switched to another product did the problem clear up for me.  Might just be my skin, but sadly this is a no-go for me.  BTW I could not wear under make-up unless applied at least 15 minutes before applying eye make-up (or it would smear off).	-1
Although I did not experience anything negative from using this product, I didn't really experience a benefit either.  I was particularly paying attention to the area under my eyes and around the corners, but I have not seen any improvement there, which is a bummer.  Products like this are so expensive, they ought to work great!  I will also caution that a little goes a LONG way with this product - even when I was trying to use as little as possible, a tiny dab was always plenty to share between both eyes.	-1
Im not saying that this doesnt work well, but it doesnt work well for me. I am a 40 year old woman who still suffers from the occasionally bout of acne, and in addition to not being able to stand the smell, this stuff burns like crazy when its being applied. Maybe for someone younger with less sensitive skin, this will work better. For me, its not a product Ill continue to use.	-1
Not to be a buzz-kill to the all natural front as I know there are some die-hards out there, but in the case of this wash it is just too overpriced for something that does very little. Yes, it seems to be non-drying and non-irritating to sensitive/oily skin, BUT so are products like Basis or Cetaphil - both common washes that dermatologists typically recommend because they too are gentle and non-irritating, and c-h-e-a-p-e-r. But to each his/her own. This wash will not expunge all of the makeup and dirt - you will have to use a towelette or pre-wash before you wash with this in order to get everything off your face. Or you may have to consider a toner of some kind after in order to eliminate any remaining makeup residue. Like another reviewer said, it's like water. There isn't much to it. Smells ok, lemon-esk to me. Otherwise, it isn't praise-worthy to me.  **** Sept Update After several months of use I've found the acne blemish kit - which includes this wash is completely unsuitable for sensitive skin. If you have ss, run far and fast from this particular line. Perhaps JB's other products are good, but this line left a sour taste so to speak. Ultimately it ravaged my face and I had to abandon the use. When I addressed this with JB they refused to refund me. Instead they line to encourage users to keep using it passed the 45 day refund period by saying it can take up to 2 months to see results. So buyer beware. Be prepared to be stuck with it if you hate it. They don't seem to care that it gave me blackheads, which I never had before, and caused the cystic acne to spread and swell. The purge is a marketing plow. There is no such thing. If you find it is irritating after 2 weeks stop using it. It is not the purge, unless you consider inflammation a purge. Company failed to back their product to my satisfaction.	-1
The holder is different and a cheap one that keeps coming out.......Bronzer is OK....	-1
draws compliments everywhere I go. The entire line of "Euphoria " is outstanding. BUT, this was delivered opened and without a nozzle. The box was torn along the seam as well.	-1
Peppery scent, not much lather, too expensive	-1
From the description, I thought I'd like this, but I don't.  I've been using American Crew body wash for years and haven't found one I like more.  I thought I'd try this because of favorable reviews.  Smells too "woody" to me instead of refreshing.  Of course fragrance is subjective.	-1
Makes my skin super itchy	-1
Expensive and doesn't last long.  Not really worth it in my opinion and I won't reorder.	-1
I purchased the Jane Iredale pressed base, warm sienna, yellowish, as I have redness issues. I found it was making me greasy in the "T" zone. So, I bought the Abcense it works ok but it's hard to apply I tried the foundation brush and the flocked sponge that comes with it. it's hard to tell between enough, and too much of it. The biggest draw back is that it attracts and holds every minute fiber/dust/particle that gets near it and sticks to it, this is very annoying. I was there would have been a liquid/pump version instead. I doubt I'll buy this and wouldn't recommend.	-1
COLOR IS OK., BUT ABSOLUTELY NO LIP PLUMPER! DOESNT STAY ON THAT LONG EEITHER	-1
To be fair this is a nice soap, but for $22? I received this as a gift and liked it well enough, but when I saw the price I knew I'd never purchase it for myself. It was really no better or worse than cheaper soap.	-1
Doesn't appear to be any better than other higher-end hand cream and I hate the metal tube.	-1
Makes my hands sticky and oily. Doesn't moisturize. Hate the smell - very stinky.	-1
I was excited to try this "fresh and youthful scent." I like light fragrances, not anything heavy and overpowering.  This was... awful. Like a big jar of cheap, old lady perfume. Very sweet, but not young at all. The bottle is pretty, though!	-1
A little heavy on my skin. Think I'm gonna wait until the colder months to use this regularly.	-1
doesn"t really cover at all .	-1
It was too liquidy for me. I could see that I'd use more product than I intended.	-1
This came already used- if it wasn't opened and used, it would be a great product!	-1
I USE SEVERAL OF JANE IREDALE PRODUCTS AND HAVE BEEN HAPPY WITH THEM.  THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I TRIED THIS UNDER EYE CONCEALER.  FOR ME, NOT THAT GREAT.  NOT AS MUCH COVERAGE AS YOU MIGHT LIKE.  THE BRUSH APPLICATOR FEELS NICE BUT YOU REALLY NEED YOUR FINGER TO PUT IT ON.  LIGHT COVERAGE AND I FELT IT WAS MORE OF A UNDER EYE HIGHLIGHTER THAN TO BE USED FOR COVERAGE.	-1
I love Prorasos products-  but this version the white sensitive skin version is not my favorite.  It is hard and difficult to lather up- with my brush and ceramic cup. I would and will order Proraso again- just not this kind.	-1
This stuff is kind thin and doesn't seem to give as smooth a shave as the regular proraso cream. The lighter smell is ok but it just doesn't lather well. I have sensitive skin and love Proraso's regular line of products but this white label "sensitive skin" line is too sensitive for me. I'll stick to the regular proraso line.  SHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower & wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100's on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream (you can let it set in a minute), shave WITH the grain DOWN, SLOWLY, SOFTLY (don't press hard- let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry! Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I've tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. If you don't want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their C.O. Bigelow label) then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3's are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you'll notice a difference overnight.	-1
I enjoy a number of the Clean scents, but not so much this one.  This perfume smells mostly like flowers and musk.  I'm not sure which flowers, it's hard to tell.  Both the florals and the musk are definitely noticeable.  It didn't smell much like clean skin to me.  The Clean perfumes aren't supposed to smell like traditional perfume, they're supposed to just smell good.  I felt like this one fell short of that.  It smells like perfume.  That's not in and of itself a bad thing (I mean, I LOVE perfume), but this is not a perfume I would select. I'm not a big fan of obvious musks, and this one has a pretty obvious musk note to it.	-1
Am I to see a difference in wrinkles or elasticity? If so, I do not. Been using it for 2 weeks now. going to stop	-1
I was super disappointed with this cream because it is so heavily scented. It says its for sensitive skin--but I cannot use it because its too perfumey. I will not buy again, but I use it around hair line and neck and on hands because I have it, and I cannot use on actual face.	-1
Below quality and performance for the price. Extremely aggressive,uncomfortable and poor shaving perfomance results. Much better razors well under $20 that exceeds the performance and quality issues.	-1
To aggressive	-1
This is a beautiful periwinkle blue, but streaky beyond belief.  I wear polish all the time and can apply my own polish with very professional results.  This took three coats and streaked even on the third coat.  It evened out with some Seche Vite on top of it, but it's still not perfect if I look closely in sunlight.  No worth all my hard work.  I'll take it off in a couple of days.  It's going in the trash.	-1
Very cheap nail polish. It chips very easily.	-1
I love Essie nail polish, but for some reason this one chips off very easily. Maybe it's the shimmer.	-1
it left the stain on my nails after removed...	-1
The first time using this polish and it is very thick and does not go on evenly. Won't let me return and I'm very disappointed. I won't be buying polish off Amazon again. I usually love Essie.	-1
Essie nail polish usually impresses me, but this polish does not last more than a couple days. I would be very surprised if it was real Essie.	-1
The brush is splayed out so i can't really use it. Just seems like cheap bristles or something?	-1
In person it's different then pic	-1
Not even close to same color shown here. It was actually dark pink/purple	-1
I was so excited to see Essie nail polish on amazon.... I thought I was ordering this barely purplish more reddish wine color as seen in the product pictures but it arrived as an undesired purple. I can't return it so I wasted $9 on this color that I will never wear. I want my money back. I always rave about Essie nail polish but this was a disappointment just because the photos aren't accurate. I guess I have to buy it in store from now on to be sure of the color.	-1
I love the color Like Linen but it's super runny. I've put on four coats and it still isn't a solid color on my nails..	-1
Extremely light!	-1
For some reason when i put this nail polish on it goes on with a matte finish and looks weird. I feel like when i bought it that it had been tampered with before. None of my other essie colors that i've bought from a store has done that.	-1
I bought 2 of these and I'm very disappointed. These cost the full price of an Essie polish so I expected it to be authentic... These are watered down fakes. I wish Amazon would do a better job of regulating this stuff:(	-1
Really disappointed.  Streaky, way too sheer, and hardly any color.  Not at all what I expected from the pictures.  Went straight in the garbage.	-1
It was NOT THE COLOR SHOWN NOR WHAT I expected...its a brown/gray	-1
It was watered down! It was a waste of my money	-1
The first coat was too thin and watery!	-1
Love Essie, however this color got very thick and dried out rather quickly. Only was able to use it twice. Not to happy	-1
it may be an old Essie nail polish because it chips and comes off too easily from nails	-1
Nice color but a little too light for me.  It has sparkles in it too, which I did not know.  U might like and u might not.	-1
Not as pretty as I had hoped.	-1
The polish I received looks nothing like the one shown for sale. It looks more similar to Essie's "Play Date." This was also the first time I've purchased nail polish online. Lesson learned: stick to purchasing polish in person.	-1
I love Essie nail polish...but this color itself is only SLIGHTLY different than "Butler, Please". I purchased this in the store, and it appeared more purple under the lights which was what I was looking for. I put on a layer of "Butler, Please" on one nail and this on the next one. BARELY any difference. Still a pretty color but just be aware that it is just like this color. Now I have two of the same basically.	-1
Product received promptly in a well cushioned envelope.  However quality of nail polish leads me to believe it is either extremely old or had been sitting for a long period of time in extreme temperatures.  Nail polish is extremely watery, not at all glossy even after 3 coats. It is not the quality I am used to when compared to other Essie nail polishes	-1
Polish chips very easily  Love the color.	-1
I'm a huge Essie fan and loved this color in the salon. Bought on Amazon and it was goopy and not the quality I've learned to expect. Something was off.	-1
First, the color shown here, which looks like a soft apricot, was actually a garish orange: my toes look like I am wearing orange peel! Second, as another reviewer mentioned, the polish goes on streaky, and it was only after much effort, and much time, that I was able to achieve some semblance of coverage.  I have never thrown out a polish, but this one I did. I think I will stick to Opi polishes, they have a better quality overall.  As for this Essie polish: COMPLETE FAIL, I hated it!!	-1
Too many coats have to be applied to get the color. I was disappointed when I had to keep reappling. Polish is very thin.	-1
I have had nothing but problems with this polish. It's streaky no matter how many coats or how much Seche top coat I use. It's super pretty and makes me sad that the formula is so crappy.	-1
I like wearing neutral color on my nails and I usually love Essie.  I went with this color to get some subtle glitter.  I was disappointed with the product.  It goes on with lots of streaks.  It needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish.  I stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it doesn't last as long.  The good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  I wore it for almost a week, so that's good.  I doubt that I would have been able to do it with 3 coats, but I will experiment.  It is a good color for the office, but I still wish that it was less "watery".	-1
Im use to Essie polishes being of better quality. I had to put on 3 coats to get an accurate color pay off.	-1
This is not the real thing. It's fake and a horrible one at that. If I could put zero stars I would. So disappointed.	-1
I don't know what colors the other reviewers are talking about but I bought Green, Shake your $$ Maker.  The color looks awesome in the bottle, but when you paint it on your nails it is a very translucent green.  As one reviewer said, it looks watery.  After three coats it still doesn't look right.  I always use a clear top coat and that doesn't help it from looking terribly matte as well.  Just beware, maybe other shades fare better.  I'm a huge Essie fan and it saddens me because this looks like such a great color and they currently do not offer anything close to it.  I have discontinued colors that are similar but don't have the punch that this one has.	-1
I really loved the color, and that's why I gave it one star. After I put the polish on, it was bubbly, it was very thick to put on, like polish does when it gets older, really disappointed since this was my first Essie polish purchase.	-1
2 coats and a topcoat and still it chipped.  Thought at this price it would be better quality polish but no!	-1
I was surprised to receive RED nailpolish. This picture is deceiving. I was expecting a pink color. It shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate.	-1
I am not a fan of this polish.  It has a relatively dull finish and take 3-4 coats to effectively coat the nail.  I would not recommend that other people purchase this polish.	-1
I saw this color and it looked beautiful, a very orange coral type color!!! But once you put it on it's like matte.... In a bad way ! It doesn't have the shine and beauty as other Essie nail polish have!! Very dissapointed	-1
You definitely need to add more than 2 coats. Super sheer and my nail shows through. I'd resell it if I could	-1
I so badly wanted to like this polish.  I am all about wearing pink in October, so I jumped all over this when Cut & Blow offered a good deal on it and its companion polish, Pink Works.  Imagine my disappointment when I tried to wear it last week.  This might be the worst formula polish I have EVER worked with.  Sheer but patchy, lots of dragging, and even after three thin, even (well, as even as I could manage), there were still unevenly-colored spots on my nails.  Such a disappointment.  If you're looking for a pretty pale pink shade - KEEP LOOKING!!	-1
The color does not come out like it is pictured until you apply about 4 coats. Who's got time for that.	-1
I guess I should have read the reviews before I ordered, this polish has absolutely no shine! It looks terrible, hate it!!!	-1
Ok to be clear I have to point out that the seller was great! I received the product early and it was packaged securely. The issue I have with this polish it that it NEVER DRIES. I love essie but the formula on this one is aweful. The color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle. BUT even with one coat (I tried it out just to see if it'd dry that way) it'll smudge as soon as you touch anything. The better buy would be sinful colors endless blue!! The colors are identical and the formula's great!	-1
I loved the color.  But this entire color line by Essie chips VERY FAST.  Even with a great top coat.  Fortunately it dries fast.  But I found myself having to redo my nails almost every day with all of the colors that I bought from this line.  Making me shy away from Essie for a while...	-1
I love this color (and many of Essie's colors), but the polish gets so many bubbles as it dries that it's unusable.	-1
I was excited to receive, but it is watered down and is not the real thing.  It came out matte and runny.  I was extremely disappointed.	-1
this nail polish, although Essie brand, is horrible quality. I don't know if it's the manufacturer or the distributor, but it went on like paint thinner, no shine, chipped after a day, very flat. I do not recommend.	-1
This is not really neon. You have to put 3 coats since it's sort of clear the first coat and streaky the second coat.	-1
It's a jelly formula which means it takes 6 coats or so to be opaque. I'm super disappointed!!!! I was so excited only to be extremely let down. Awful formula, do not buy. Even over white it just looked ugly and messy.	-1
This was not as purple as it looks here. If it were more cool toned gray I would have loved it too. This color is best on darker skin tones. It looked odd next to my fair skin.	-1
When applied, this looks horrible and watery...nothing like when purchased in a store. I would not recommend buying these online. Very disappointed.	-1
The pink color advertised is actually almost clear when you put it on your nails, no matter how many coats you put on. I mixed it with a white polish, which helped, but you shouldn't have to do that. Don't expect a solid color	-1
This didn't work for me... I couldn't get the ink to come out. I twisted and twisted... and nothing... I can say the brush is soft...and about the size of a eyebrow pencil. I must've received a faulty one so I can't rate it as high as others.	-1
What is the big deal with this misting water in an aerosol can?  My skin does not feel any better than if I just sprayed it with tap water.  Given the expensive price tag, I do not see why you would need it.	-1
What a disappointment! I have been a fan of La Roche-Posay products for many years and was very much looking forward to trying out this new cleanser. But here is what I found:  - Cleansing power is average, not good, not bad, and so is the slightly dry feeling after product usage.  - The company says that it has a "unique cooling effect for a refreshing, pure feel". While I did notice a slight cooling effect, I don't think that it amounted to much at all. I definitely expected something stronger than just a very mild and very fleeting cool feeling.  - But what really, really made me dislike this product is that it is heavily fragranced (at least to my nose). I wouldn't say anything if this were Lancome or Estee Lauder - both companies that seem to use a lot of fragrance in their products. But this is La Roche-Posay - a company that advertises products for sensitive skin and calls itself the dermatologists' brand! In the product description on their website they describe it as being "Soap-free, Alcohol-free, Paraben-free, Safe for sensitive skin". What they forgot to mention is that they added tons of fragrance to this. While the product rinses off ok, the fragrance does not and I could not wait to use some toner to wipe off every trace of this smell that was way too intense for me and that I plain hated.  While I will continue to love&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/La-Roche-Posay-Toleriane-Fluid-1-35-Ounces/dp/B000IO6NFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">La Roche-Posay Toleriane Fluid  1.35-Ounces</a>&nbsp;precisely because it is fragrance-free and just all-around great for sensitive skin, I am still wondering what La Roche-Posay was thinking when they came up with this Cleansing Gel. It simply does not fit their brand philosophy nor does it smell good at all.	-1
This is an okay eyeliner. It goes on smooth enough and lasts as long as others I've used. But, it's actually slightly more irritating to my eyes than other eyeliners, so I won't be using it again. I don't see anything to justify paying $17 for it, either, but that's the La Roche Posay brand. It's expensive. I also agree that it's hard to get out of the wrapper, but I think the Amazon Vine label over the pencil's wrapper was the problem. It kept the perforated pull strip from pulling all the way down.	-1
This is not soft enough to leave a line on eyelids.  It works fine for eyebrows and costume applications.  I did apply some for a patch test and there was no irritation, which  is a good thing.	-1
This is almost white. Not nearly the pink they show in the picture. Won't buy polish on line again..	-1
Chipped the next day. Don't waste your money	-1
Polish chips within a day or two.	-1
I bought Bee Mine Forever, put it on for the first time today. This polish is a darker yellow than it looks to be on the listing, which, ok, that happens, but it's just really terrible overall. The consistency is such that the first coat is streaky, and the second coat does not help, the streaks beneath are still visible. I have had it on for just a few hours now, having used the OPI base and top coat for this line, and it has chipped already even though I have done nothing chip-worthy. This line of polish is really hit-or-miss with color, consistency, and durability and I would say this one is a major loser. Also do not recommend the silver or Beyond the Pale Pink.	-1
I dispute the claim of being super shiny. These polishes are no more shiny than any other. Don't buy the hype. OPI I expect more of them.	-1
I had such high hopes for OPI's Infinite Shine, but it is just not a good product. I ordered the primer and top coat, plus two colors--You Can Count on It and Can't Be Beet!. The consistency of the pink, You Can Count on It, was awful--streaky and gloppy; it left brush marks that refused to smooth out after application. I let the first coat dry very well before applying the second coat, but it, too, left brush marks. Can't Be Beet, a dark, rich red, was better, but not great. The pink (primer, 2 ccolor coats, and a top coat, began chipping the very next day. What a disappointment! I will stick to OPI Gelcolor.	-1

This is the powder dry shampoo. While I like the powder; the picture is of the SPRAY! Which is what I thought I was ordering.	-1
I was going to use the entire bottle before I posted my review but I'm already having problems so here it is. First thing I noticed was how cheap the packaging is. Normally that doesn't bother me too much since I'd rather be paying for what's in the bottle than what's outside of it but this packaging is a problem. It's supposed to dispense a red liquid and a white liquid in equal amounts when you press down on the pump however after only a couple weeks it only dispenses the red liquid now. I have to try to cover the red hole and push it down again to get any of the white liquid to come out which makes a big mess and usually just gives me twice as much red as white. It's really annoying. I've cleaned out the tube and everything thinking that maybe it was blocked but it's not. I don't know if the pump dispenser inside the white side came loose but it's not like I've been rough on this bottle or anything. It goes in my drawer and out of my drawer and that's it. As for what it's done for my skin, I'm not really sure I see a huge difference. It's nice and I do like the way it feels on my skin but I can't really see any huge benefits, certainly not any that justify the cost and the crummy packaging. Maybe my skin feels a little plumper but I can't really be sure if that's when this product or just my general skin care routine. I might consider trying this again if they changed the packaging but I can't recommend it as is.	-1
I was really interested in trying this product and have stopped using my regular product.  I am having a couple of issues that are bothersome.  The smell is a problem for me.  It is sharp and unpleasant.  It also feels funny on my skin.  It is almost like it has set up a layer of starch over my skin.  It is kind of weird.  I have used many good serums and products before and never had such an unpleasant result.  I have put the product on the back of my same hand for over a week and there is no difference in the skin of my hands.  They are equally parchment like, in all the funny little wrinkles.	-1
Used this product for years. The results Do Not Last More than a few hours and at DOUBLE THE PRICE ITS NOT WORTH IT. Save your money!	-1
Smelled funny.  Had a sticky residue.  Too pricey.  I prefer replenix products over this.	-1
I love this brand, but this one didn't work as I was expecting, I like perfect hair. And it works in Europe but it leaves my hair like if Im using the cheapest one.	-1
I have to say I'm unimpressed.  From all the positive reviews, I'd expected this BaByliss dryer to be SO much better than the various less-expensive dryers that I've bought over the years.  It's just "okay" at best -- nothing special at all in my opinion.  I like it no better than and, in some instances, like it less than some dryers that I've paid $35-40 for in the past.  The main things that bug me about it are the temperature and power settings.  Other than that, it's fine because the noise level is acceptable and it's reasonably comfortable to hold and maneuver.  But temperature and power setting problems are a pretty big issue in a blow dryer.  There are three temperature settings.  The high heat setting is way too hot to use and burns my scalp the couple of times I tried (maybe I got a bad dryer?).  The medium heat setting is barely warm, so is pretty ineffective at drying hair.  The low setting (cool) is okay.  The two power settings are also off.  One is full-blast-blow-your-hair-all-over-the-place and the other is this meager poof of air that dries too slowly.  Neither are very effective IMO.  I'd thought that this was maybe just a learning curve until I got used to a new dryer.  But I've been using it for several months and still dislike it.  I'm going back to my $40 dryer.	-1
I just used it for the first time. It took a long time to heat up and only one panel worked initially. I don't know if it is defective or not.	-1
It's a fake. The plate coating and the paint started chipping after 3 uses, but 30 day return is over :( This burns your hair horribly.	-1
Returned.  Not sure if it is defective or just awful.  No blowing power.  Didn't get hair dry.	-1
The color was not at all what I expected. It's VERY PINK, and not in a natural way. The color shown here looks very natural, a pachy-pink color and perfect for my fair peaches-n-cream skin color. Sadly to say, it is so pink that I cannot use it. I'll find someone to give it to. Not for me	-1
I usually love Jane Iredale, but this blush is a disappointment.  I know the picture shows the tube, but it is REALLY small, 3" tall with only 2" of product inside.  I thought I had misordered and got lipstick at first.  The color is nice, goes on very nice, but SMELLS.  I think they made it smell like chocolate - yuck.  Seriously, when is the last time any woman put chocolate on her face? I buy Jane Iredale because of the superior quality, quantity and non allergic smells, etc.  This one failed on all three.  So, if you would like to smell like chocolate, buy this blush.	-1
Broke after a few months	-1
I'm not sure what to make of this mask. After using it, my skin is definitely softer, but I can't say that there is any noticeable benefit. This has not whitened or brighten my skin, nor does it offer much in the way or purifying or clarifying my skin. It's nice to use to calm my face or just to enjoy the feeling of having a ton of gloop on my face, but I wouldn't purchase this again when it runs out.	-1
I've tried this consistently for a month now. Unfortunately it has done absolutely nothing to cure my acne scars. I have fair skin with a lot of acne scars. This tends to break me out after I use it, I'm assuming because of the beeswax residue that's left on the skin to help seal the vitamins. It also seals & clogs the pores. From my experience, I wouldn't recommend this, just pass on this one.	-1
I used this product (a small amount goes a long way) for over a month under my usual moisturizer. I noticed no changes to my skins appearance good or bad.  Would not purchase in the future.	-1
My main problem with this product is that it does not absorb very well into my skin.  I'm not overusing the product, just two pumps at a time, but even after I massage it into the skin, it feels tacky.... slightly sticky.  It then takes what I consider a looooooong time to fully absorb.  Additionally, I have not seen any marked improvement in my skin, compared to any less expensive moisturizer.  At this massive price, I would expect better results, either in the application of the product, or the effect on my skin.	-1
I cant tell if it does anything to my hair. What a waste of money. I put a little bit on and all I got is like my hair were dirty.	-1
I love Oribe products, but this might be the only one I don't like.  The scent is refreshing; however, this product left my hair feeling very weighted down even when I used a very scant amount.  I found that my hair felt this way whether I let it air dry or blow dried it.  Maybe it's better for someone with thin hair, but it didn't work well with my hair,	-1
Absolutely no moisture for my curly frizzy unmanageable hair. The detangler was a waste as well.	-1
I received this and didn't check it, saw no need. When my other can ran out , I went to use this can and it will not spray. Can't return according to order status, return window closed August 30. Bummer	-1
This sat on top of my thick, frizzy hair and made it feel extra thick, dry, dirty & unmanageable. Too expensive. "Pssst" drugstore brand or Bedhead "rockaholic" are better.	-1
I didn't find this anything special tbh	-1
I'm so surprised what great reviews this product has received I didn't think it was worth the price at all and I love Oribe's Gold Lust shampoo and conditioner but I only used a pea size amount on my thin/medium very highlighted hair that's bra strap length and it seems to have already weighed it down maybe my hair would be better with cream for style over this just my opinion but this was not worth the price tag	-1
I love the oribe line but this was a waste of my money.  used it for months with no effect and or difference noticed and I am an avid shampoo and conditioner user. thank goodness I bought the small bottle!	-1
Doesn't hold up but smells good	-1
OveR priced sells good but not great product doesn't hold up	-1
Yes, I dare to give Oribe conditioner only two stars. Why? Ok, well, this stuff costs a fortune, and is not all that great. I have fine, dry hair, and definitely need a conditioner after every shampoo, but for the cost, this stuff just hasn't been worth it. After using it for about two months, I switched back to my old conditioner which works far better and is far less expensive. I've used Biolage for years now, and it actually works. I won't buy this conditioner again. I can barely tell that my hair has been conditioned after using it, and then my hair is oily within two days. blech.	-1
the bottle is not sealed like it should be. the bottle is half full and reeks...not the pleasant smell of the genuine product. disappointed in spending so much only to be scammed	-1
dries my hair out. not worth ur money. wouldnt use it if it was free	-1
I heard so much about this product that I wanted to try it.  It didn't work well for my hair type, which is naturally soft and hard to style.  It left my hair soft but really too soft.  I found it was difficult to style no matter how many styling products I used.  I ended up giving it away after a few uses.  It might work for someone who is looking to wear their hair in a straight style or someone that has course hair.	-1

Hampton Sun SPF 15 Tanning Gel is in a very attractive container. It looks quite posh, for this type of product. Really it does. I thought it would be nice to give it a try, as I do a fair amount of gardening, and I walk to work and spend time outdoors. I like a wee bit of tan on my face in the summer. Why buy bronzer when you can get it for free, right? Now, on a particularly hot and sunny day I would want a product with a higher SPF. But since most of my outdoor forays are early in the morning, or fairly brief, I rarely feel the need for the high SPF products. This seemed like it might be a nice product to try.  I cannot say definitively if this actually works or not. I have a wee bit of color on my face, as I do every year at this time. I don't know if Hampton Sun SPF 15 Tanning Gel has protected me, or helped in any way. But it feels nice to apply,and is very light. And it is very posh looking, so if that matters to you, I say go for it. If you don't mind a multi-colored tube, that might be a better choice.	-1
I am disappointed in the very expensive Hampton Sun SPF 30 Lotion.  It is dispensed in a nice pump bottle with a shiny gold cap, the bottle is packaged in a cardstock box that is more than an inch taller than the bottle.  Seeing this in a store would give the impression that the bottle is larger than it is.  As for the actual lotion, the smell is very offputting for me, a combination of chemicals, fruity fragrances, and it actually makes me nauseous.  This has a SPF of 30, but it is really not a sunscreen, just a layer between your skin and the sun that is water soluble, so if you perspire or swim, it will wash off of the body.  The bottle has a warning to use a waterproof sunscreen if you will be getting wet and it also warns to not keep this bottle in the sun or heat.  In other words, be sure to keep this in your cooler if you take it outside with you.  I was unfamiliar with Hampton Sun products and cannot recommend this particular product to people who want to protect their skin from cancer or aging.  For those who are not sensitive to fragrances and are keen on getting a tan, perhaps this will work for you.  I will continue to use this on my legs, but I cannot apply it to other body parts because I really dislike the smell.  When I am outside for longer than an hour or when swimming, I will not use it at all.	-1
This product does not correct nail polish well and it is a waste of  my money. Use cotton swabs instead.	-1
The tip gets so clogged with colour in a few minutes, that it becomes fairly useless.  Just use the side of an old nailfile to get rid of those excess bits, works a lot better.	-1
Oh. My. Goodness. This is the single most awful shade of lipstick I have ever put on my lips. My husband and I laughed our heads off when I put it on. We couldn't decide if I looked more like a clown or a low rent hooker. An unemployed clown working as a low rent hooker might capture the look best. The "London" is brighter than a neon sign...I mean ghastly awful fake raspberry fuschia weird red pink bizarre color. I had to work hard to ignore the color enough to review the lipstick itself. It went on smooth and neatly, nice clean lines. It tasted pretty good, which surprised me. I am not used to flavored lipsticks. i don't know how long it would last because i used makeup remover to get it off my mouth after we quit laughing.	-1
This is not the color (London) shown on the models.  The color looked wrong in hand but I thought maybe it would look like it is represented online once I put it on.  Nope.  I looked like a clown.  The color is a garish orange red.  It is very bright & looks utterly ridiculous.  I guess this color might work if you have dark skin, but if you are fair you will probably want to avoid this.  I showed my husband & he agreed with me 100% that I looked like a clown.  I tossed this in the trash, it's not like I can give it away.  What a waste! Regarding the feel for the short amount of time I was wearing it, it went on super smooth.  It did not feather at all.  As it dried it became more of a matte so it started to feel dry.  My overall impression is that this will dry out the lips. I know this isn't exactly the same type of lip product, but I recently tried&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Neutrogena-Moisturesmooth-Color-Sticks/dp/B00ADRH0O4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Neutrogena Moisturesmooth Color Sticks</a>&nbsp;in Plum Perfect & Rich Raisin.  I love both colors.  Plum Perfect is very subtle color.  Rich Raisin is bolder & goes perfectly with my pale complexion.  On top of that, this stuff is ultra moisturizing, it doesn't feather, the color lasts, & it's affordable.	-1
