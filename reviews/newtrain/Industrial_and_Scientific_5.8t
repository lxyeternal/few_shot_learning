I use Copper Sulfate to kill algae in my swimming pool. I like how this comes in a jar with a lid on it as 2 pounds will last quite a while. And buying it in bulk like this saves money over buying expensive chemicals made exclusively for swimming pools.	1
good product would recommend	1
I used this for an experiment to do Copper Plating, and it worked well. I am not sure if it does worked for whatever was originally intended.	1
As described and pure, Using to keep the roots out of my sewer lines...	1
Great product for electroplating with copper AND the root killer saves a visit from the roto-rooter folks every year. I suspect this product will be taken off the market by environmentalist wackos, so STOCK UP NOW.  You might find Zep products at a lower cost but the purity is not the same. A beautiful copper patina can be electroplated on a variety of metals with this product from FDC.	1
Some reviewers have stated that these are unreliable and output bad information or that the button sends random signals. The reason they appear to be unreliable is not due to build quality but is in fact do to these reviewers using bad code to utilize the hardware. When used with the proper code the rotary ability works 100% as intended. I must admit that for someone using a rotary encoder for the first time these will appear to be poor quality, but it's simply because they operate in a very complex and unintuitive manner.  It does not help the fact that the reference materials on the Arduino website are full of false information. The sample codes they have do not work well whatsoever and should not be used in my opinion. Many people will tell you the reason these sample codes do not work well is because the encoder is bouncing so all you need to do is introduce a debounce timer in your code; this in theory could work under limited non-real-world-use conditions, but will not work well in practice, and introduces input lag which will cause the encoder to function slowly, and therefore, code debouncing timers should be avoided. Others will tell you of this problem and suggest "hardware debouncing" though the use of capacitors of various capacities soldered across the pins. This will not work because the problem is not the hardware but rather the method of interpreting it via code.  For the proper code to make this work I highly recommend using the code from the following website: [...] BE ADVISED THERE IS ONE SMALL BUT EASILY CORRECTED ERROR IN THE CODE FOR THE FULL STEP TABLE IN VERSION 1.1  The incorrect table included in the download DO NOT USE THIS TABLE: const unsigned char ttable[7][4] = {   {0x0, 0x2, 0x4,  0x0}, {0x3, 0x0, 0x1, 0x10},   {0x3, 0x2, 0x0,  0x0}, {0x3, 0x2, 0x1,  0x0},   {0x6, 0x0, 0x4,  0x0}, {0x6, 0x5, 0x0, 0x10},   {0x6, 0x5, 0x4,  0x0}, };  ONLY USE THIS CORRECTED TABLE: const unsigned char ttable[7][4] = {   {0x0, 0x2, 0x4,  0x0}, {0x3, 0x0, 0x1, 0x10},   {0x3, 0x2, 0x0,  0x0}, {0x3, 0x2, 0x1,  0x0},   {0x6, 0x0, 0x4,  0x0}, {0x6, 0x5, 0x0, 0x20},   {0x6, 0x5, 0x4,  0x0}, };  As for the button sending out random signals this is because it requires a pullup resistor which is not installed on the board. Without the pullup resistor the voltage of the input the button is connected to will float and can have an unknown and fluctuating voltage which will act like random signals. This is easily corrected though: you can either enable the internal pullup resistor on the microconroller you are using (check online for how to do this with your device), or else you can implement your own pullup resistor. Either of these methods will keep the button input at a constant and known high state until pressing the button pulls the voltage low.  CONCLUSION: When used with proper code these devices work properly and exactly as expected. I would normally remove a star for the inconvenience of there not being a pullup resistor installed for the button, but this is so easily fixed (especially if you can implement the built-in pullup resistor of your microcontroller) that it's not a big deal and doesn't warrant removing a star for an otherwise 100% functional device.	1
I wanted a way to control an Arduino/ DDS (direct digital synthesizer) project without having to use a USB port on my computer so using a rotary encoder came to mind.  From the description I assumed I would have to use an external push button to set the frequency range but when I got the parts I found that they do have push button capability.  However, you have to install a 10k pull up on the board for it to function.  Unfortunately the board is laid out for surface mount parts but since I have a stock of surface mount resistors and experience with precision soldering it wasn't a problem.  So be advised.  I suppose you could put an external 10k pull up but that is an inelegant solution, imo.  Anyway, I connected it to my Uno, slapped together some code and the unit worked perfectly.  There have been some of complaints about the boards that I'd like to address.  First off, all of the boards I received all are threaded.  The diameter is .267 inches.  They may be metric so the closest metric equivalent is 7 mm.  I would have taken off a half of a star for not providing mounting hardware but considering the price they are worth a trip to the store for a nut and washer.  As for accuracy, most encoders or even switches require some sort of  debouncing in a high speed circuit.  The simplest way is to debounce them is in software with a short timing delay.  I had no problem with accuracy for the ones I bought.  Finally, for those out there without experience using rotary encoders go visit howtomechatronics.com and click on the rotary encoder tutorial.  Since I don't believe in reinventing the wheel I copied his code and built upon it.  Update 27 Nov. 16: I've added a schematic for a hardware implementation debounce interface.  All the parts are readily available on amazon and other electronics houses.  I've based this circuit on suggestions online and built and tested it to make sure it works.	1
There are two versions of the 3.2 being sold - one features pre-soldered pins on the outer edges creating a DIL-wide package that is perfect for breadboarding, while the other (pin-less) version allows the user to decide how to integrate their Teensy into a project. I happen to prefer the pinless version for the simple reason that adding a RTC crystal to the underside of the Teensy 3.2 is marginally easier when there are no pins in the way. Similarly, attaching a 2x7 SMD pin header to access the pads on the underside of the Teensy is slightly easier when there are no pins on the outer edge yet. However, if you have no need for the those inner pads, then buying a pinned version of the Teensy may be a good time-saver.  The Teensy is an amazing microcontroller series that fits into a standard breadboard. They are extremely easy to use and work out of the box with the Arduino software package once you also install the Teensyduino software add-on. The installation package comes with extensive libraries and examples. More suggestions can be found on the PJRC web site.  The Teensy 3.2 is a small incremental improvement over the Teensy 3.1 series. There are two main differences: 1) The addition of a small external voltage regulator. This is a welcome addition as this voltage regulator tolerates a wider range of input voltages than the voltage regulator found inside the main MK20 chip. Naughty wall-wart power supplies should now have a much harder time smoking the MK20, killing the Teensy. The new voltage regulator also offers up to 250mA of power @ 3.3V vs. about 100mA for the old implementation. 2) The bootloader chip has been upgraded. The new bootloader chip is smaller (hence making room for the newly-added voltage regulator) and also removes the minor "don't ground D33 during startup" issue that affected the 3.0 and 3.1 series.  All in all, if you are interested in microprocessors, this is the one to buy. It offers oodles of RAM and Flash memory relative to a Arduino UNO, it offers far more serial communication options (3), a 12-13 bit ADC with up to 20 inputs, plenty more GPIO pins (33, though some are shared with the ADC), and it literally is tiny. The size limits the ease with which some pins / pads can be accessed on the underside, but fear not, several tindie enthusiasts offer breakout boards that make it super easy to access every pin and pad on the Teensy 3 series.  The only limitation relative to an older UNO is that the Teensy 3 series only runs on 3.3V (though the digital pins are 5V-tolerant). Thus, you may not be able to drive some devices directly with a Teensy, unlike a UNO which allows more power per pin. Another difference between the 3.1 and 3.2 vs. the Teensy 3.0 series is that the 3.1 and 3.2 have a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) pin, while the Teensy 3.0 does not. All Teensy 3 series can be fitted with a RTC crystal (CFS-206) to enable time-keeping capabilities (some soldering required). To keep time while the Teensy is not powered, you need to supply a 3V battery and connect it to the VBAT pin.  What sets Teensy complerely apart from Arduino however is the support. While both communities have forums that enjoy enthusiastic participation by users and gurus alike, Pauls forum actually has thousands of messages from Paul in response to questions, bug reports, etc. Now have a look over in the Arduino forums... the hardware and software developers hardly ever grace them... it's volunteers that are frequently powerless to fix underlying code issues, unlike Paul.  Paul typically squashes reproducible bugs within a week, followed by updates to his software package that anyone can download. Feature requests from users (such as enabling a TX pin on a RS485 chip as long as the Teensy is transmitting data) are implemented. Libraries for display drivers, SPI, I2C, etc. are updated to take advantage of the Teensy 3.x hardware, resulting in much faster, feature-rich, and better implementations.	1
Not only is it fast, but it has USB/HID built into it. That lets you use it as a game controller.  Got a favorite joystick that's stopped working? Replace the old controller board with a Teensy 3.2 board. This board can give you all this & more;  32 Buttons  6 Axis (X, Y, Z, Rotate Z, Left Slider, Right Slider)  1 Hat Switch  There's even a usable sample code that lets you use the Teensy as a joystick controler - pjrc.com/teensy/td_joystick.html  . There are reasons to buy this with, and without the pins attached.  If you're new to Arduinos, the attached pins make it easy to use with a breadboard. Also, you won't save all that much money if you buy one without the pins attached.  On the other hand, if you know what you're doing, the board without the pins may be easier to build into a project.	1
For its size and power, this is the best microcontroller currently out there in my opinion.  The developer community is strong and PJRC is really devoted to supporting this device.  The only thing I wish this had was a DSP chunk on the ARM since this series does have that as an option. I'm sure the decision not to do it was done for a reason, but it would have been cool to have it.  Nevertheless, an amazingly great microcontroller.  My go-to when building things.	1
Works well, quick delivery...	1
This is a multipack of regular-old magnets, which I thought was worth pointing out since so many people are looking for the super powerful neodymium magnets these days. Personally, I think these standard magnets are nice to use for sewing projects, as they make nice closures. However, some people love the neodymium power -- so make sure you get the ones you want.	1
perfect toy, as long as they're old enough to not swallow them, they're pretty strong	1
They work OK but are bigger than expected and have a metal residue on them...	1
Worked great will buy again	1
Great table.  Rolls good and I use it for storage and have a cook top on top.	1
These are garbage.  Ordered three and all of them had dents and scratches that made them appear trashy.  The damage was due to poor assembly and poor design rather than shipping. The are also wobbly and flimsy.  Buy the Trinity's here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DBQ0D8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1 They are great looking and all stainless. Even the adjustable feet.  Contrast that to the poor quality galvanized legs that don't fit the sockets and the cheap plastic feet on these.	-1
ok	1
The table arrived very quickly and has no defects. The protective plastic is difficult to remove but worth  it because the clean mar free surface revealed under the plastic was a pleasant surprise. I read a few negative reviews and was a bit apprehensive, but very pleased with the table I received. A wonderful addition to my hobby room.	1
Love there little guys.  I put them under a tool cabinet shelf and hand extension cords.  Hook could be bigger but they're fine for small hanging.	1
I ordered these and another brand for comparison. They are ALL GREAT!  And I'll put my "winer disclaimer" in on these also. YES the hooks will probably be left loose, about  of a turn. I think it's for "alignment" purposes NOT because sopmeone at the factory DID NOT TIGHTEN YOURS.  IF it's too loose for you buy own turn just screw it in that last little bit.  I LOVE THESE MAGNETS... Just what I needed.	1
I use these around the shop and kitchen to hang things up.  I would not call tehm Mega trong, but they hold up a few thin wrenches or a dish towel.	1
did  the job	1
surprisingly strong; this is the second set of these I've purchased; always coming up with uses and multiple places.	1

Very happy with these.  They are strong.  They are holding many things on my refrigerator.	1
very strong. highly recommended. i used them for all kinds of things.	1
Worked like a charm, I hung a metal flat bar under my large wall spice rack, added the magnets, got chip clips with open area (for hooking), so my chips are now hanging, also hung potatoes with stronger magnet hooks and a small laundry bag.	1
Much better tool than I expected, it will certainly work very well for what I bought it for.	1
I use this at work for checking runout on a variety of parts.  We normally have to maintain a +/- .005" tolerance and straighten to that tolerance.  This tool works great.	1
I GOT It LOOK GOOD .	1
Low price but does not bond together like my other abs filaments.	-1
This filament is good value for the price. Their recommended extrusion temperature was not hot enough. I found that 230c with 0.4 nozzle worked for me. With their recommended temperatures the print was not sticking to the raft on the heated bed. I double checked the extruder temperature and that was displayed correctly. The print results after the temperature change turned out very good at 1,2 and 3 micron. After a hot Acetone fog bath they turned out even better, very glossy.	1
This does not smell anything like ABS because it does not have a smell at all! This is great stuff. I recently purchased a XYZPrinting Da Vinci 1.0 Pro and the ABS that came with the printer had a very strong odor of melted plastic. With this, nope. I do not need to print with the windows open.	1
I love this stuff.	1
very good black right on the mark 1.75 mm no jams	1
Hatchbox is the only way to go!	1
first filament I just cant print with, jams misfeeds, won't buy again	-1
Inconsistent diameter, clogs, jams, warping... Worst abs I've ever used.	-1
I go through hundreds of these they cut real fast .they don't last long but that's because there so thin for cutting fast. Be careful they damage easy and will fly apart wear safety equipment!	1
These work well and the price is good. Cut better and last longer than th DeWalts I used previously at a lower price.	1
great product. Great price. Hassle free purchase!	1
Good	1
I purchased a 5 pack of dewalt cutoff wheels for my angle grinder, thinking, "oh, these are the GOOD QUALITY cutoff wheels. When I run out of THESE, I'll purchase the cheap-o brand."  Boy was I wrong. These went through 2x the steel that the dewalt cutoff wheels before replacing.	1
Good quality product for a great price. Every once in a while you'll find a wheel that unravels, but still can't beat the price.	1
Great cut off discs.  Better than some big company discs I've tried.  Will buy again when I run low...	1
Great deal for these cut off discs. Well made and last long enough.	1
I have never used these very thing blades before but so far they have worked much better than Dewalt and other brands from HD	1
Well made, great price	1
Got this today and used it to cut stainless schedule 10 pipe.  Great product and long lasting. I will definiately buy this again	1
They do a good job.	1
The best I ever used. Re enforced from both sides, less fragile than others and cut very very fast and clean.  What else can you ask for.	1
These are a good quality terminal block. I do like the fact that they have the plastic cover that helps to prevent shorting out by something touching the connectors. I have no complaints with then terminal blocks.	1
I used these to clean up my wiring for my landscape lighting (12v AC). I know that my current requirements come no where near what these blocks are designed for, but I wanted a large block because I use 12GA wire for my lighting and wanted the larger screw terminals.  === The Good Stuff ===  * I ended up using u-shaped spade terminals on all the wiring ends (blue ones), and these worked great under the screw terminals. I typically had 2 blue spades under each screw, and had no problems fitting them into the block or tightening them down to keep everything secure.  * Because the terminals are only shorted in vertical pairs, I needed to make a number of jumpers to connect a few columns. Since I could get multiple spades under a single screw, this worked out well.  * My application is outdoors, but protected from the weather in a box. The clear plastic cover is not a waterproof cover, only serves to keep you from touching hot wires. I am confident that the plating on the screws/terminals will be enough to survive in this protected environment without corrosion...time will tell.  * There are two screw holes for easy mounting. I have a piece of plywood mounted to the rear of the box, so no worries about standoffs. The plastic does extend far enough so that the rear of the screws does not touch anything to the rear.  === The Not-So-Good Stuff ===  * The plastic covers are only a friction-fit into their little mounting holes. If you remove them once or twice, they are not all that secure.  * The metal strips are only "press-fit" into the plastic block. They don't seem like they will ever come out, but they are loose. Somewhat unnerving, but fully functional.  === Summary ===  These worked fine for what I wanted them for. I was a little concerned that they were not wide enough for mutiple "blue" spades to be attached, but have put two spades per screw with no problems. It would be great if they shipped with some sort of shorting block to tie multiple columns together-but easily remedied.	1
These terminals have have worked out great for my marine application. The plastic cover is embossed with numbers 1 - 6. I needed a stationary point for wires going to a replacement wiper motor from a new switch box location. At each end is a recessed screw hole for attaching to a bulkhead surface. You will need your own mounting screws. I used crimped ring terminals for better holding security but the clamping element at each terminal is very suited to bare wire.	1
If you are into tinkering with wires like me you will appreciate a quality terminal strip like this one. It works great for most devices requiring less than 25 amps. The screw terminals are #6 and hold firmly in place. The clear cover keeps debris making for a safe semi-permanent connection.	1
These terminal strips are of the Very Highest Quality - beyond what I expected.  I especially like the plastic face covers that prevent accidental shorting or otherwise bumping / interrupting the connections once made !!!	1
I bought these header pins because I recently ordered a HackerBoxes subscription and though the boxes usually come with everything you might need to do that months project I found it was useful to have these extra header wires around to aide with the projects or for my own personal projects I might end up having.  These worked perfectly and were a great deal with for the price.	1
These are excellent quality header pins on 0.1 centers.  They can be cut to any size if needed. Excellent price and delivery was before the indicated expected delivery window.	1
Worked good for my project	1
Great value and arrived on time	1
Just as I was expecting. China Arduino products are hit and miss for containing these. Great price and now I don't have to worry about a seller not including them.	1
Item as described.	1
I have gone through 2 of these boards. First one caught fire when a transistor shorted out because a switch (filament monitor) was the wrong way around, the instructions are such bad translations of Chinese to English that it was shockingly easy to get wrong. The board NEEDS some circuit protection. Second board died for seemingly no reason at all... Stopped reading more than one temp sensor at once, can't seem to work out why but I don't even want a new one. I replaced it with another board from OSOYOO. Do not buy this board if you can find anything else.	-1
I reloaded Marlin firmware as I was not sure of the release. When booted, all of the motors and heaters were doing stuff. I assume a test loop. I used Arduino software to load Marlin-1.1.0-RCBugFix . I'm saving it in case my other board gets hurt.	1
Update: flashed and installed the board today. It works perfectly.  I did not receive the board pictured. Instead, I received a red board labeled MPX.3. If I can make it work I guess I'll keep it as a spare.	1
Ordered / purchased just to have the extra board on hand. Great price. Fast shipping.	1
Not as dark as I'd like, but it isn't an objectionable medium blue.  This doesn't give the feeling of having too much purple in it.  It prints about as well as other, more expensive,  filament brands.  Very pleased so far.  Shipping was fast.	1
No harsh plastic smell that you have to open all the windows in the house to print. Purchased for my XYZPrinting Da Vinci 1.0 Pro, this combo is amazing and will print like a $4k printer if the bed is leveled just right.	1
very good white right on the mark 1.75 mm no jams	1
right on the mark 1.75 mm red color prints well at 233 deg c	1
Hatchbox is the only way to go!	1
Bought this with a spool of black, the black was semi ok had curling issues but the white is the worst curling filament I have used so far. It's not a true white more like a cream color. I wouldn't reccomend anyone buying the white.	-1
The good:  It's cheap and prints pretty darn smoothly. The bad:  The printed color is a tick or two toward orange and there is a bit of moisture in the roll I received.  This is really good budget plastic, just be aware that it is not a true red and that it needs to rest in your drying container for a week or so.	1
This filament is the worst I have used so far, every 2 seconds and sometimes constantly there is popping and crackling because there are air bubbles in it. I've had other filament that has made a few pops but this is enough that it has ruined basically all items I have printed with it. And its not just my printer, I have gone through every possible tweaking and adjustment to make sure my printer is dead on accurate but this stuff just will not print correctly. I'll give 2 stars because it seems to be pretty consistent in diameter, but even the packaging this stuff came in still had a lot of air in it.	-1
good	1
Excellent price.  Excellent buy.  Makes those CFLs and LEDs last much longer with  no wasted energy.	1
Hummm, I had to purchase with for the motor I just purchased... worked out great!	1
great to have in resurve	1
Handy tool	1
As advertised.	1
like it	1
good	1
I use it as quick reference when Im putting together a materials list for a project. I know what I want in inches but that is not how the metal yard sells it. Well made and handy	1
Great tool for going through the remnant piles at my local steel yard.	1
Pretty nice and easy. Great tool to have handy	1
great for us metal workers	1
If you're a beginner MIG welder, this thing is a must-have	1
Item as described.	1
Convenient to have around	1
If you get it in "just the right light", you can actually read the inscriptions!!!	-1
Don't waste your time or money. The etching is very poor. The only way to see the numbers is to hold it on "just the right angle". Squinting may help.	-1
I like these better than the round ones for weldable-thickness sizes.	1
I agree with the others that say the etching is too light or faint on the item received. I thought perhaps those people got a bad one, hard to believe that Miller would make anything that doesn't function.  There is a hole with a key ring, but the tool arrived bent at that hole.  If you need a useful and easy to read guage, look elsewhere until Miller sorts this one out.	-1
This Miller Electric metal thickness gauge seems to be decently made considering what it cost. It is imported from China and made from one piece of non-magnetic stainless steel with etched markings and also came with a key ring attached. It's hard to see in the pic above, but the gauge has three marked slots on the bottom edge for checking welding wire sizes of .024", .030" and .035". It has a max thickness of 5/16" and is also marked with decimal equivalents.	1
I got it to replace one I lost. Accurate!	1
Use this all the time as I sort through metal to use and to help set up welder. Even carry it with me to the salvage yard when I'm looking for metal for projects. It's just easier to be sure than to "guesstimate" thicknesses and gauges.	1
Great product. Very handy if you need a quick reference or need to check metal thickness. My only complaint is that the etching is difficult to read.	1
Incredibly helpful, simple, and inexpensive tool.  I bought another so I can tether it to my welder.	1
Well made, clear markings, heavy duty metal.  I removed the ring so it would lay flat in the tool drawer.	1
Nice gauge, makes a nice key ring as well,	1
Handy gauge to keep on your wending cart / bench. While most experienced welders can usually tell by looking I'm sure, but new guys need some help. This fits the bill and quicker than getting the calipers out.	1
Too sharp to use as a Key Chain, but a really nice tool to have if you Weld or Fabricate steel.	1
you can't go wrong with Miller	1
VERY GOOD	1
Good	1
love it	1
It works good but doesn't cover all sizes. There are gaps as some common metal thicknesses are not covered.	1
I've used this gauge many times and am glad a made the purchase. Good quality too. Good stuff.	1
well made	1
got two to gauge for welding	1
No problem	1
Stuck a piece of velcro to back side and put on side of welder so I maybe won't lose it.  Very handy and easy to read. Got this for tig welding since gauge is more critical than mig or stick welding.  Clears up the confusion wondering metal thickness for amp settings.	1
Awesome tool for a fabricator or body man. It's small enough to keep in your wallet, but can be kept in any toolbox, or even a welding wire compartment on a mig welder	1
This gauge is great for carrying to the steel yard to hunt for drops. It has the typical sizes most people would look for. The larger, circular gauges have more sizes but I'm really only looking for a small handful of plate and this smaller, easier to carry gauge fits those. The large circle gauges don't fit my pockets well at least without tearing up the material in my pants! Don't you hate that?  TIP - When you're shopping for just a couple sizes, draw marks around those gauge spots with a sharpie pen. Makes it easier to quickly see the appropriate slot when you're upside down, holding a big piece of steel out of the way, sweat in your eyes etc. When you're finished, wipe the sharpie off with rubbing alcohol if you don't need those marks any more.  NUTHER TIP - Write notes on the back of the thing with that same sharpie. Decimal to fractional equivalents, weight of various thicknesses of steel, phone numbers of cute girls that work at the steel yard etc.	1
piece of crap. i slipped a piece of 20g into the 22g slot. that's not supposed to happen so this gauge is useless.	-1
Easy to use. Sturdy construction, will last a long time.  Measurements are laser-engraved and easy to read (even for my 46 year old eyes). Allows you to quickly measure eleven (11) different gauges of material, as well as your (3) wire sizes.  Whether you're a DIY welder or a professional, this gage will come in very handy. Key ring allows you to carry/have one at all times. I hang mine on my welding cabinet for quick and easy access.	1
I purchased a Miller 211 welder back in late 2012.  My welder came with this gauge and I was so impressed with it, I purchased two more just to keep them around the shop.  This gauge accurately and easily measures sheet metal thickness allowing you to leave your calipers in the drawer.  Nice tool at a great price.	1
Decent quality but shorter than I need for my Austin Mini.	1
they work great and made job easier	1
good quality, verysatisfied	1
Great fit & finish, just like the larger sizes.	1
They worked well on a new brake line assembly	1
Quality items at a great price.	1
Disc work great and a really great price.......	1
They work great!	1
I bought these thinking they're on the less expensive side of abrasives and thus wouldn't last long.  But these discs are every bit as good as the name brands.  They work well, wear well, and don't gum up.  If they stuck the name of a tool manufacturer on the front label you wouldn't know the difference.  I'm very satisfied and will buy again.  Thanks Benchmark!	1
Great	1
fair quality for a good $	1
They work well and last as long as much more expensive options.	1
I use flap disc abrasives all the time. I love this ten piece set. Doesn't wear out the metal as fast and you can do more detail work with them!!	1
Great value, good disks great for fast material removal.	1
Definitely less media as others have noted but for the price you can't beat them.  I'd rate them higher than the harbor freight variety but not as long lasting as the 'name brand' ones.	1
Great	1
Much better than the cheaper ones! I will be buying these from now on. Cheaper ones work great. Just these donkast longer and worth the couple more dollars!!	1
Lower Price Flap Disks that work great. I am building a motorcycle trailer and bought many of these flap disks in a variety of grits. They last as long or longer than disks costing much more. Very Good quality, well balanced.	1
Have not used extensively yet but seem to perform well and price was reasonable. Will have to see how durable they are. 5 stars for now.	1
These work great and cost mush less then from the big box stores	1
Good product at a real good price	1
These appear to be identical to most of the brand name discs except for the brand label and they work as well.	1
Great product and long lasting on stainless steel	1
These don't seem to last nearly as  long as the ones I buy locally but there a lot cheaper	1
This sanding disc last just as long as some of the high dollar ones that I have used in the past. Great value for your money. I used this disc for grinding down welds for seamless weld lines along grinding steel for shaping corners and angles in metal fabrication. I will order this product again.	1
Good PLA for 3D printer.	1
awesome product delivery on time would recommend to any one	1

Bad news here.  This PLA is extremely brittle and does not hold fine details or any details of the print.  I tried various temperature settings and received the same sub-standard quality on all.  I had to take my print head apart to remove the filament.	-1
This PLA is a little hard to print with.  It needs a higher temp than other PLAs.  But, I've noticed that with other glow-in-the-dark brands.  The color is cool, but the glow aspect isn't as bright as other brands.  Nevertheless, it's an interesting color that can be perfect for the right project.	1
This product glows great.  Only thing I would change is how rough on the print head this is.  My printer nozzle got clogged up more than once.	1
It is glowing indeed. The color and texture of the prints is not bright and smooth, but it is ok for the night play in the dark.	1
Great filament prints very well nice color great price. It glows a greenish color in the dark really nice.	1
It pains me to write this as black magic 3d has given me some really cool plastic in the past. but this last spool I just got into it and it's not the same color as the last spool of it I got. more over it's not as responsive to black light. overall the quality is just worse. it seems brittle and prints kinda spotty at times. I'm sure they just didn't properly clean out some black pla or something from their spooler before hand but because I ordered it so long ago and just now opened it i'm unable to return or exchange it now. so I guess i'm stuck with cosmic bleh. in the picture you can tell they are pretty different. ironically because I had such a strong light on them the one that is no good actually looked lighter but it prints with more of a blackish brownish hue then the other spool did.	-1
Bright blue glow. Works great.	1
I've made numerous prints with this material and had little to no difficulty getting this to work at recommended settings. This has worked just like any other PLA filament I've used.  As far as the glowing I hold it up to a bright light for about 10 or 20 seconds or so and it glows brightly as shown in the mocked up image for a good minute or so after which it continues at a moderate glow for longer than I've cared to sit around and watch.  I feel ridiculous writing this - but you should note that you DO need to "charge" this plastic up with a bright light in order for it to glow. It doesn't just glow on it's own with no charging.	1
Prints just find with my normal PLA settings on a Duplicator I3.  It needs to be under direct and decently powerful light to charge, but once charged well it glows great.	1
This stuff is not that great I was able to get a print of the Eiffel tower out of it but it wasn't easy to do. Not a very consistent filament.	-1
Nice.	1
I have all my filament in clear plastic tubs, if I have been working for a while, it's quite strange to see an eerie blue glow coming from the room when I turn the lights out. The glow is very nice and the plastic was easy to print with on my flashforge cp.	1
4 or 5 stars?  5, I think - for the intended audience.  With an integral clamp meter, variable freq. drive filtering, and the type of thermal imaging it has, it's clearly in the industrial category, with a strong crossover into some types of commercial work.  For those users, having these in-hand, in one device, saves time.  For anyone else, it's extra weight and size for infrequently used functions.  The clamp meter is good.  If this type of rigid clamp works for you, terrific.  If you have to carry a flex clamp attachment anyway, I'm not so sure that the integral clamp is worth it.  One thing that some WILL use it for, of course, is as a handy hanger.  Not sure what Flir would think of that, but you know it will happen!  The thermal imaging should be clearly understood to target close-in troubleshooting use.  It has good functionality, with emissivity settings and the ability to select the spectrum display color scheme.  The image is, shall we say - crappy.  That is, muddy and low-res.  However, it's perfectly fit for purpose, which is finding hot spots, again, close-in.  The thermometer seems accurate, though I didn't test it at either low or high extremes.  This will not replace a dedicated imager for many purposes.  The DMM functions are well-implemented.  No surprises here.  Conventional dial.  The usual extra button presses for a few things.  Auto or manual ranging, true RMS, etc.  It is not as fast as my Fluke 87-V, but seems accurate given the precision and count differences between the meters.  The only complaint I have here is that I like fast response for continuity and found the FLIR a little slow for that.  Build quality is high.  The CM174 is packaged with decent silicone probes (pointed), with removable tip covers for extra reach when needed. I'd think that alligator clips might also be included at this price.  I'm not crazy about the plugs' location on the base of the meter - which also doesn't make sense of the right-angle probes - which are designed for conventional face-mount plugs.  The ergonomics are mixed.  It is best when in-hand.  The build is thick, but narrow side-to-side.  It's easy to hold, easy to hit the clamp trigger, and comfortable, the lower half being wrapped with rubber.  Dial clicks are positive with no mushiness.  Button pushes are a little soft, but also have a subdued click at the end of the push.  The imager sticks out from the back of the case.  If it were more so, it would give a good angle for desk use, but it's not quite enough.  And unfortunately, the tripod socket is located just below the imager - close enough that it will keep it from mounting on some tripod heads.  There is no fold-out stand.  One surprise was no case was included!  Seriously?  At $500, SOME sort of case should be included, even if it's a cheap zip without padding.  All in all, a superb meter for the right user.  Well made, accurate, safe.  The combination of features is unique, to my knowledge.  Again, if the functionality of this meter is your daily bread and butter, you're going to like it a lot.  If it's not, then you'll be hauling around (and paying for) things you rarely, if ever need.  If that's the case, buy a conventional DMM and you're done.  The sweet spot is the industrial/commercial electrician who covers a wide range of activities and troubleshooting.	1
I'm a home handyman and a DIY-er, and the first thing I have to say, to be honest, is this is probably too much meter for your average home owner. At $500, it's more than you need to test your normal 120 V circuit, or 12 v vehicle or other DC system. You'll see other reviews here by professional electricians who use the FLIR clamp at work. Unless you're really into electronics and understand what you're measuring, you probably won't use many of the high-end features on this remarkable device.  Ok -- assuming you're still with me; this is something special. I've been reading up on this, and it was introduced to the pros in 2015 as the world's first built-in infrared imaging hand-held meter. I've tried it out, and it's easy to use the laser "pointer," and run it over a circuit breaker panel, or other electrical motor or device, and see in real time, any unusual "hot" image on the screen. When something is hot (where it's not supposed to be), that's a sign of a short or other problem. In addition to the laser and image screen, another special feature when compared to other clamp meters, is the very handy built-in flashlight. Many times when you're trying to see what's happening in a tangle of wires, the ambient light is not sufficient to show you what's going on. The work light really helps. I won't go into what each setting on the dial does; there's a very good, comprehensive manual that comes with -- written in clear English, by the way, unlike many made-in-Asia devices these days. That's a plus.  One of the best things you can do is go to the company's own website and look this device up -- lots to chew on there. Another idea --  copy the make and model number and paste it into a search on You Tube. You'll find some very good instructional videos that show you the function of each option on the dial, and much more.  For those who are up to the technical challenge of this handy, pocket size, nicely designed and engineered thermal imaging clamp meter...  Recommended.	1
FLIR has been slowly branching out from just single purpose imaging tools.  Here they wrap a high quality Clamp Meter designed for daily Electrician use, and add on a basic FLIR imaging sensor (it also takes the temperature of the center of the screen).  The best part is that this doesn't really increase the size of the unit, and the unit is built quite tough, so basically you get an added tool/screen without adding more to carry around on your person or in your toolbox (The cameras on the back stick out slightly, but more than likely it won't be an issue for you).  It also adds a work light on, which is great for more dimly lit areas.  I know the thermal camera is designed as an add on just to help detect warm wires, shorts or other problems, you can't save the images.  The standalone ones generally have a removable SD card, or some other on board storage to save a few images (these images are not huge, think cell phone camera quality 7-8 years ago).  Unfortunately there is no option for this, and as far as I can tell no upgrade of this tool that does that.  I know it potentially would have added more bulk and cost, but not being able to save images to document, or to send is unfortunate.	1
In many ways the FLIR CM174 600A True RMS AC/DC Clamp Meter is an impressive tool. It feels good in the hand, has some heft to it and includes a killer color display. In fact, I've never owned a test meter of any kind with the display quality of the CM174. True, it's a small display--only 2.0 (50mm.) But the color TFT display is amazingly clear. It's like holding a tiny HDTV monitor in your hands.  I am always concerned about measurement accuracy, so I put the CM174 to the test. I used a calibrated, precision voltage source and precision 1% resistor to measure the accuracy of the meter.  For AC/DC Voltages (up to 1000 V) FLIR rates the meter at 1.0%. Therefore a calibrated 200 volt DC source should read between 198 and 202 volts. The CM174 measured the calibrated DC source as 201 volts DC. Check!  A test using a 1% 1,000 ohm precision resistor yielded similar results. FLIR states the resistance (6,000 ohms max) at 1.0%. Therefore a 1K ohm precision resistor should measure between 990 and 1010 ohms. I measured a precision 1,000 ohm resistor as 1,002  ohms. Again this is right on the mark. (Consider that the resistor itself could be off 10 ohms in either direction.)  This is not an electronics meter--it is an electrician's meter. I mean by this that the meter won't read resistance above 6,000 ohms or capacitance above 1000 F. Components used in most electronics devices exceed these maximums. But that's not a knock on FLIR or the CM174. The meter is not designed to be a replacement for a Digital Multimeter. Instead, it has plenty to offer. The FLIR CM174 is equipped with a built-in thermal imager, amperage and voltage measurements (within the above ranges,) and center-point temperature readings. It checks diodes and measures true RMS AC voltages. It also reads low impedances. Plus it is auto ranging or manual ranging--your choice.  While there is much to like about the FLIR CM174, there are some things that a meter of this class (and cost) should offer. There is no where to clip the meter leads when they are not in use. The battery case lock is flimsy and there is no external case provided for the meter. A $500 meter should have these niceties included.  Still, overall this is a handy, accurate, professional and very easy to read clamp meter. It will give you just about everything you need for your professional or careful amateur electrical test needs.  No manual to speak of	1
As technology improves, we see not only better and cheaper versions of existing products, but entirely new products that couldn't even exist a few decades ago. This new clamp-on meter from FLIR not only delivers higher accuracy and better quality than the inexpensive meter I bought 15 years ago, it also offers a number of functions that weren't even conceivable, let alone possible, back then. Most notable is the true infrared camera that's available at the push of a button. If you're not an electrician, you might wonder what use an infrared camera is, but detecting heat is a critical part of checking whether a home or business is wired properly.  Much of the National Electrical Code is concerned with heat, and how to make sure that wire and devices don't overheat. There are regulations regarding the gauge and run of conductors carrying a given load, how many conductors can be bundled together carried in conduit or a duct, or how many circuits can be squeezed into a box of a given size. All these are intended to prevent overheating and fires. A true imagining infrared camera can quickly scan walls or conduit or breaker boxes for unusual heat output (see photos). There's also a laser pointer that allows the user to pinpoint the site being measured.  With all the functions crammed into this meter, it's no bigger than standard meters and fits easily in my electrical tool belt. It runs on four AAA batteries and good quality ones are included with the meter. Learning how to use all the functions takes some study, and it takes a computer, as the manual comes on a CD-ROM. There's also a printer reference booklet, but you'll need to use the manual to discover all the functions of this meter.  Yes, it's expensive, but really not that much more expensive than other high-quality clamp on ammeters. It's overkill for the homeowner or occasional  user but for the professional electrician it looks like a very useful tool indeed.	1
It's amazing how much thermal imaging can help pinpoint issues quickly, first thing I do after I pop the cover panel off the electrical panel is take  thermal image.  I can get a quick glance of any potential over amperage conditions and then use the clamp to investigate further.  There are a couple of things I think could be better, turning on the targeting laser you have to go through the menu, would be nice to have one button access to that feature.  It's ofter hard to tell exactly what you are looking at in thermal image, so using the laser helps pinpoint issues.  It should come with a case, especially with the screen and camera.  You should be able to send the photo's easily to you phone or computer, but haven't found a way to do that.  I would recommend it if you are a professional electrician, I think this could be a big time saver.  Even if you are not an electrician, you can still use the camera to find overheating motors and other mechanical issues.	1
Really like.	1
very good	1
It's what you'd expect.	1
recommended	1
The wood is strong, no knots or splits that would weaken it and make it dangerous.  The wheels roll nicely.	1
Makes my life easier, I'm handicapped and can't  secure wheels onto my low shelf unit to make cleaning easier and this works well as a substitute	1
Glad I got it, I needed something that would make moving a small refrigerator. i REALLY needed it when that fridge needed to be returned to wallyworld. pushing it across the parking lot into the store was easy. now i added a 2 x 2 piece of wood and the new fridge sits comfortably on it	1
Strong dolly with quality wheels	1
These are fantastic and this was a great price.  I saw them at Harbour freight for $20	1
good	1
whati put on them fits very well. it makes it items allot easier to move around with no problem	1
just what i needed	1
Used this as an item in a set of FAK I created for all of our vehicles as well as our hiking bag. I feel that this will really come in handy when I need to wash out some cuts and bruises my boys acquire.	1
In the QA section, some customers have measured and reported that C-U Innovations sent them needles that were 1.5" long. I was expecting that when I ordered this product, however C-U sent me needles that were only 1" long. Also, the needles don't have standard needle caps so you cannot contain any leftover fluid within the needle without first removing the needle and covering the syringe opening with the (included) blue cap. That makes this product very UNFRIENDLY to use for inkjet refills because you don't want to have any leftover ink spilling out the bottom of the uncapped needle nor do you want to have to physically remove the needle just to put the blue cap on and get ink everywhere in the process.	-1
If you DIY your e-liquid you'll have to get these! Easy to clean and easy to use.	1
Works very well. Smooth stroke. Needle reaches into bottle.	1
I use these for mixing vaping e-juice.  The blunt tip needle works great for flavors and PG.  The syringe with no needle works great for VG, which is too thick for the needle.	1
Does what it is for	1
Yep.....JUST what i wanted.than you.	1
Awesome quality product	1
perfect to strengthen Ikea and other kit furniture.	1
Good quality, attractive price.  That's what I'm talkin' about!	1
KEEP THESE GUYS AROUND	1
Very good quality, not flimsy at all. But their small size limits what they can do.  Overall , they are sturdy  and well made. And should provide sufficient reinforcement for small projects.	1
Good - well made. Nice sturdy little bracket.	1
Oh my god, so totally worth the price! I use these on all my projects and these are the best I have found in recent years. A total win.	1
I use a fair amount of this epoxy in the garage for building and repairing things. I like the packaging. It is much easier to use than the dual syringe version. You mix as little or as much as you need at the time. This is available in both the 4 1/2 oz and the 9 oz size.  This is the fast hardening version. Have your items set up and ready to glue. Once you mix it you only get a couple of minutes before it starts to set up. Mix equal amounts of the two parts. Mix thoroughly, but minimize air bubbles by not stirring too vigorously. It let it sit about 30 seconds after mixing to let air bubbles pop - Then I apply the glue.  If you apply to plastic, roughen the surface a bit before applying to improve adhesion. I have used it with polycarbonate (Lexan); acrylic (Plexiglass); PVC; phenolic; and even polypropylene. The bond isn't as strong on the slicker plastics - but it does stick. I doubt it would stick to polyethylene or UHMW. It sticks well to metal and wood.	1
just love it	1
Works exactly as advertised. Two thumbs up.	1
works great.  Instant bond means instant just FYI	1
Frankly I'm a big fan of J-B weld, but you don't always want your mend to be black. Benn looking for a clear epoxy that can be used over & over and tried many. Oddly I'd found some of the gorilla glues to do the average job just fine. But not quite hard and durable enough.  This stuff is rock hard (after curing) seems very durable, and if your surfaces are clean it bonds very permanently. Nice tops that include a little inside cap so the separate epoxy & hardener don't evaporate. TIP: don't thro those out. Set them aside and don't allow them to touch one another. Keep them so you can take the top off and return them inside the cap for storage. If you do this, these small bottles will likely go a long way. You don't need much and its tough stuff.	1
fast set and strong	1
This is a really good epoxy that lasts in the container very well. My last lot in larger bottles was still going after 10 or more years. I had to buy more because I lost the hardener. I highly recommend Bob Smith products.	1
There is a reason why this product is highly touted by designers and cosplayers for adhesive needs. I do a lot of 3d printing and I needed a way to cure my super glue to full strength instantly and let me tell you: This product lives up to its name, it dried and cured Gorilla Glue in SECONDS (It says 8 seconds but I counted to 20 just to be sure) and at FULL STRENGTH! I had to try and take off the bead on a scrap piece. And it smells PLEASANT! Definitely using this for ALL OF my adhesive needs.  As much as I love JB Weld (and I sprayed this on a scrap piece and it seemed to cure right away, but I would probably have to wait for an entire 24 hrs to get to full strength), Gorilla Glue and this "Zip kicker" is all I need. I even bought two of them.  EDIT: I just tested this on some JB Weld, and HOLY CRAP, it cures in half the time... I tested it on a scrap piece of PLA and it just clung there.	1
Saves lots of fiddling around when using CA glue. Spray and near instantly the glue sets. The only thing that might improve it is if it was a different type of dispenser so you don't have so much waste in a broad spray.	1
As expected .... Thank You.	1
- Thick so it doesn't run all over the place, does set up pretty quickly, dries clear, strong bond.	1
product is as advertised , haven't had a chance to use it yet.	1
Works great with the Bob Smith Instant glues.	1
Make sure to not use too much hardener it screws up the rigidity after its set.	1
If you use these types of epoxies sparingly over long periods of time it would be a good idea to separate out smaller amounts in second containers. The reason is even a small amount of air over time will cause the resin to thicken and harden in the container. This can happen even if you cap quickly after use. I have this brand and another in larger 5 oz bottles and it has always gone bad before I use all of it. So the strategy is to take out 1-2 oz of hardener and 1-2 oz resin and put in separate air tight containers/tubes for quick use. Then quickly cap and seal the extra for later use.	1
I have no issues with this item.	1
Wow i love this Epoxy so much thanks	1
Just what l needed for my rc boats.	1
Good stuff !	1
this stuff works great	1
No more waiting for glue to dry, this stuff works instantly	1
Easy to use.  High quality.  Will buy more.	1
Great stuff	1
Seems to do it's job and does not smell bad either.	1
An excellent companion to cyanoacrylate adhesive.  I use it all the time and have used it for a long time.	1
Works great. 5 minute set. Work fast or the mix is unworkable. I like it because all I need to do is hold it for a few minutes and set the glued pieces carefully. Full cure in about 3 hours.	1
I wish I would have discovered this stuff a year ago. Now that I'm using it I don't see how I can work without it. I've already used 3/4 of the bottle since I bought it 4 weeks ago.  It also has a very nice smell to it.	1
I wished I had found this earlier in my life, I love super glue but hate how it won't bond instantly and usually gets on your fingers while trying to hold it still, this stuff spray on the part you are going to glue to, put the super glue on the other part, contact in together and within 8-10 seconds in bonded tight and dry, wow love the stuff.	1
Pretty good stuff.  Good price.  Quick setting.  It has worked well for me with semi-porous materials.  Acetone is a good solvent for cleanup.	1
I been using Bob Smith epoxy for years for building rc models. It's very durable and hasn't let me down!	1
Helped me set fine glue joints.  Trouble is it over sprays on these fine joints--would be nicer to have a finer stream nozzle for accelerator.	1
this stuff is freaking awesome!!! cures the BSI super glue in seconds, rock hard!	1
good stuff	1
This works awesome... Drys the CA glue instantly. Really good purchase	1
Works well.	1
This stuff is great for filling small gaps that you sometimes find when building plastic model kits. A little drop of this stuff goes a long way and it's easy to work with	1
Been using this product for many years .  Initially on RC aircraft but have found scores of uses around the house. It starts to thicken in about 3 minutes , by 4 minutes you better have it in place. After 15 minutes in  70 weather it's firm enough to sand.  Never turns brittle , retains some elasticity  which makes it resistant to cracking & fracture. Mix with microspheres for a tough light weight filler. Not crystal clear but definitely not yellow, slight warm tint. For 10 years It's worked for airframes to rear view mirrors. 3/25/17 Had to grab the epoxy to fix my wife's shoe & noticed there's not much left so it's time to reorder. A good quality fast setting epoxy is a must have IMO, there's just so many uses. I might add that the "mid cure" is great for coating & sealing as in small fiberglass and carbon fiber projects. I'm not associated with this product I received nothing in return for my review I recommend this product	1
I bought this to glue together hobby plastic fiber optic cable and then to glue it onto LED lights for my home electronics projects.  This epoxy sets up quickly but you have time to work with it, and it stays a bit rubbery for 10-20 minutes to allow for some flexing, but after it's set, it's set.  I've only used it on a few projects but I've had no failures with it yet.	1
Good stuff	1
Not very good takes quite a long time to cure look elsewhere	-1
VERY GOOD, AND SUPER USEFUL.	1
Excellent 2 part epoxy. Forget the higher-priced brands. This one is of the highest quality. It is the only brand I use for wood, metal, and acrylic material.	1
Great	1
Replacement item. Used before so I know it's good quality	1
I was able to glue 2 cars together and could not separate them! A+	1
Great product as all BSI stuff!	1
THIS EPOXY WORKS GREAT. A PLUS FOR ANY HOME WORK SHOP. I LIKE THE BRAND.  IT ARRIVED ON TIME AND IN GREAT CONDITION.	1
ONE OF A KIND	1
This is a real nice epoxy. It is easy to dispense in these container bottles. It is fast, strong and yet gives one plenty of working time.  This vendor gave very quick service.	1
i have used this epoxy on lots of things and it does a great job.  dries quick. as it comes in larger tubes it lasts me longer.	1
My standard use favorite. Even though it has a cap, it will dry out, so keep it in a glass jar, or two plastic Ziploc bags.	1
Great glue.  Using it mostly for wood.	1
Best CA on the market,accept no substitutes.	1
I THINK I'VE GOT EVERY ONE, BUT WILL COME IN VERY HANDY.	1
A very handy product to add to your glue kit for model building	1
- Great glue!  It *is* relatively slow-setting, since it's the thick version, but that works well for me since there is time to "fine-tune" the placement of parts - I'm using it to glue hardwood pieces, and it does make a very strong bond.  I haven't tried it with other materials, so I can't comment on anything aside from hardwoods...	1
Used to repair shoes.  Worked quickly, cap allowed proper amount to be used without fuss, did not cover hands in super glue.	1
Great product and a good price	1
Works great.	1
pretty sticky stuff	1
Dissolved my metal on metal problem in a minute!	1
Useless, I needed something to remove adhesive from the back of a magnet stuck to my phone. This stuff didn't even create the slightest movement	-1
i love it	1
Works as Advertised - Excellent Product	1
Works well.	1
failed to last until warm weather, got too thick.	1
Very strong bond. I've been using it with 3D prints and its awesome!	1
Very pleased with purchase & quick delivery!	1
Will dry up in the bottle in a few months but works great with the kicker.	1
Bought this for the activator but the spray bottle didn't spray!	-1
Incredible.	1
I'm actually really annoyed with this purchase. The title of 3oz includes the activator. You only get 1oz of glue.  You're much better off going with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Great-Planes-Pro-CA-Gift-Pack-1-oz-Each/dp/B002EZ5ZNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Great Planes Pro CA Gift Pack 1 oz Each</a>&nbsp;which includes 3oz. of CA glue and 2oz. of activator.	-1
How did I get along without accelerator?	1
Great CA glue and kicker. If you need to fill gaps this stuff is great with the addition of some baking soda, just look out for fumes! Nice being able to cure CA quick and it smells good!	1
Nice boards and quick shipping.  What's not to like?  Seriously, if you're looking for small boards for small projects these work great.	1
Great purchase.  Very handy for integrating new circuits designs to existing designs.	1
The accelerator is nothing short of amazing!  It's not really an accelerator.  It's more like hitting the superglue with liquid nitrogen.  Instantaneous.  I guess a word of warning is appropriate.  Be darn sure your objects are where they should be before application. It's also a potent chemical that seems to dissipate after a few minutes.  Great stuff for those situations where you have a gap that needs to be crystallized or if you're bending one material over another.	1
Worked very well!	1
not a fan of the spacing or the tabbed ends, but I think it's pretty standard. Didn't work well with DB9 connectors. But did work well with basic terminals.	1
This is just right for my projects.	1
Boards come in sheets of  8 that can be broken apart or kept intact. Approx measurements: Sheet: 6 3/8 by 4 3/4 inches.  Individual board: 2 3/8 x 1 5/8. Holes are plated through. Good .1" hole spacing. Marked "Made in China" Seems to be a good size for Auduino mini projects.	1
Good price, quality.	1
Great	1
Arrived on time and did the job	1
Really good product. This kit makes using a CA type glue so easy.	1
I don't know how thick the pads are, but it's double-sided.  Also, mine came as snap-apart boards in 4 sections.  So they could be used as 80x120mm boards, or snapped apart to their 40x60mm size, or just in half either way.  I don't think this is guaranteed by the maker/seller, but it was a nice surprise.	1
Well constructed. Plated thru and decent thickness of plating. Try not to remove parts once installed or the eyelets will lift if heat is applied too long.	1
i love it	1
Great value for the price. The boards a neatly uniform and the conductor is nicely filled into each of the sockets.	1
Great little item!	1
As advertised, nice product.	1
High quality protoboards perfect for DIY electronics projects!  I created power rails on mine by soldering solid core wire to all the through hole pads along the length of the protoboard.	1
Good value. I've used a few of these now, and they work well. Great for small arduino projects.	1
Served my purpose.	1
I have had more than enough frustrations with prototype boards tossing their copper as soon as a soldering iron gets close to them.  Trying to diagnose a non-working circuit and discovering that the traces lifted off the board is annoying as hell, and I am happy to have found a source for prototyping boards that do not exhibit that problem.  These are solid, substantially built, with pads that do not lift, strong enough to survive multiple component replacements.  I will definitely be ordering more of these.	1
Great size for miniature projects!	1
the PWBs are well etched and will serve very nicely for small projects... NO MORE wire wrap..	1
My first time using CA with the spray accelerator. Works incredibly well.	1
Nice sized prototype board.  All my parts fit nicely and I found it easy to solder on.  The board size is small, good for littler projects, but comes packaged with 4 connected together so you can keep them connected for larger projects or snap them to size for medium to small projects.	1
Right size.	1
These circuit boards are easy to work with and even chain together. Twenty five of them will last me a long time.	1
Perfect	1
Works as promised. Expectations met.	1
My Raspberry Pi loves it.  This is wide enough for the 40 pin (2x20) Raspberry Pi header and doesn't have any pre-defined busses or IC locations which is exactly what I wanted.  Other Pi specific expansion boards have busses or IC footprints that limit how the board can be used and for me made each of them awkward for the circuits I use.	1
They are just wide enough to reach the left and right sides of an Arduino Uno. Good for making prototype shields.	1
good deal	1
Beautiful boards, zero issues with soldering. Everything works like it's supposed to. Recommended.	1
The accelerator is a nice addition to the glue, cures quickly and holds well. Product was delivered early and packaged well.	1
As described	1
If you use protoboards, these uxcell 25Pcs Double Sided Protoboard Prototyping PCB Board 4cm x 6cm are a pretty good buy.  I like the value and the size for project boxes and board work.	1
What a deal! I can't believe you get 25 boards for this price. These are high quality and just the right size to interface with the RASPBERRY pi 2 and 3 MPIO.	1
They just got here and am building on one already,  These are great for the more "permanent" prototype that needs to go into service.	1
Nicely made, a great size for projects.	1
I've been using these for a few months now for Arduino project prototyping, and I think they are awesome!  I found some how-tos for using 30 awg coil wire for prototyping, and what I do now is lay out female headers on this board for my components (typically an arduino nano, components for using LIPO batteries, and a soft-latch switch that's really useful for letting the Arduino turn itself off), solder the headers onto the protoboard, then on the reverse side, use the coil wire to solder the circuit underneath.  I use the pads on each end of the board for connecting external wires/connectors.  I'm not at the point where I'm ready to have one of the Chinese mfg sites make PCBs for me, nor do I have the knowledge yet to create the right drawings to support that.  This method is quick, easy, and I end up with a high quality prototype that is solid and easy to work with, and easy for me to scavenge parts when I'm done while still saving the circuit if I want to revisit that project.	1
Very nice boards, sturdy with accurate holes	1
Works great.	1
Works great. The accelerant is awesome. The glue sets instantaneously when hit with the accelerant. Just be careful as it gets really hot instantly. I use this to glue jig bodies to jig heads and it works great....but if you are holding the hook when you hit it with accelerant it will burn you with a quickness. I would give it 5 stars if the bottle was glass as the plastic bottle tends to melt if stored in a hot place such as a metal rod box. I have ordered 2 oz brown glass spritzer to put it in.	1
good	1
These little thermistors are great. Very fast reacting and accurate. They are perfect for my greenhouse temperature sensors. Also, the shipment arrived very fast, practically overnight. Excellent product and much appreciated.	1
ok	1
Of good quality.	1
Exactly as described.	1
Worked very well - as advertised.	1
They work	1
the body twists to adjust the focus, pretty easy.  decently built.	1
No issues running motors and powering them. the Heat-sinks did arrive shorted to the pins adjacent. You may want to pick up some thermal adhesive pads when you buy these.	1
The drivers worked as expected.  I've had to purchase a few of these as sometimea you get a mixed batch (good.and bad). These all seemed to work fine.	1
Working fine after about a month of near continuous use.	1
These will work for the makerbot replicator 2x, and i propose most all newer makerbots. You need to be comfortable with soldering smd components. Put each board in a electronics vise or helping hands thing, facing up. Use a heat gun to warm the entire board, then heat to solder melting point. Using some small needle nose, pull out the rows of pins, let cool and solder the rows of pins in "upside down" on the circuit board. This is how makerbot makes their drivers proprietary. The only complication you may hit is the plastic spacing material on the pins itself are easily melted so you may need new ones, also dirt cheap on amazon... my makerbot runs fantastic and quiet. Infact these are better than the makerbot drivers since the have a current control pot on board, and come with heatsinks.  Sounds like a tedious process, and it really isnt, took me about an hour to do all 5 drivers. (However, im comfortable with smd) Consider this: one makerbot brand driver is $40, 5 of these are $10, is it worth the hour or even two of work?	1
Very nice product.  Easy to setup.  My only complaint is that it does not fit a standard chip socket.	1
No included documentation but a quick google search will lead you to enough info to hook it up.  As advertised...	1
Great little drivers.  Far better than the Pololu A4988s that I replaced.  They work really well without producing any motor chatter, and the included heatsinks have really good adhesive on them, so they attach securely.  Very pleased with these drivers.	1
I bought 3 packs of these. All 15 worked and are running almost constantly on 3 printers. No problems. If the driver seems to not work right off, adjust the pots 1/4 turn, some of them ship at the disconnect angle. Once running, adjust pots to suit the axis it is driving. I've used these on RAMPS 1.4 and Sainsmart 2in1 boards. The heatsinks have the adhesive backing tape already applied.  I just ordered 3 more packs.	1
product has helped me immensely in my current project.	1
Liked the water tight connector but the orange wedge is a pain to install. Both pin locked in place but could not get the wedge to go down far enough to exspose enough of the pins to make contact with the female end. Would not buy again!	-1
its very good and very useful	1
Great product. I'd buy again from these guys	1
Their wooden dowels seem to be good quality.	1
Arrived on time and as described	1
Well made, all of them were correctly sized, not overly soft. Well priced and quick shipping.	1
Good fit, easy to use, high quality.	1
Exactly as described and super fast shipping.	1
perfect	1
Very good printing filament. However, I wouldn't call this filament silver, it's just grey.	1
Orange was some of the best pla i have ever printed with i made a bunch of parts for my snappy v3 i just wish I could get more. Please make more	1
I'm really pleased with this filament. I was impressed how smooth it printed. Very minimal stringing. The purple pla is a nice color. Will buy it again.  Great budget PLA for the price.	1
This is the first roll of filament I have ever used on my first 3D printer.  It works great and is good in the 202-210 degree range.	1
Excellent filament at a great price. Very consistent, doesn't seem so absorb moisture as readily as some others I've used, colors match what's shown on screen fairly well. I have several colors already and will certainly be ordering more. I've been printing at 205-210c with very good results on my Creality CR-10S. I'm running the bed at 60c, on a mirror tile from Lowes, with no additional adhesive. Nozzle height must be set very low (0.04-0.05mm), but otherwise just a clean plate gives great adhesion and clean release once cooled.	1
Just finished a print of Benchy using this new filament and it came out great.  My printer had been out for several weeks now after using a very cheap of brand filament.  It's so nice having one that just works.	1
Great product, just as described	1
How good is this filament? Pretty darn good. Here's a print that just came of my Creatlity CR-10 that is bone stock. This was a 16hr print. It's the cylinder head of a 1/3 scale LS3 Chevy motor. I took the photo about 3 minutes after I removed it from the bed. No post processing, not a single thing. There were zero strings, no blobs, no zits; it's as close to perfect as you can get from a FDM that's as cheap as a CR-10. Layer was 0.2, speed 40 mm/sec, bed temp 60. Sliced in Simplify3D. The silver streaks you see are not layer imperfections they are the silver flake in the filament - the camera makes them look streaky, but trust me there are not streaks in person; it just looks great.  I'm very impressed with the stability, smooth printing, and just all around fantastic result.  Now if they would just change their silly name and silly packaging because this is some seriously good filament and the cartoon package doesn't do it justice. But maybe it's suppose to be fun, but when I'm printing for 16 hours, I want pro filament and this is stuff is the bomb - or the bam...whatever.	1
1. THIS IS NOT GOLD!!!!! This filament is bronze. It is a dark, nut brown with a metalic shimmer. Gold is always and has always been a shade of yellow with a metallic shimmer. Please stop marketing this filament as Gold! One star subtracted and filament returned because the description is inaccurate. The color is a (rather nice) dark bronze color.  2. The second star is because this filament didn't sputter or crackle. It was dry and didn't have air bubbles. Thus, it was printable.  3. One star subtracted because the spool was weirdly shaped and required modification of the standard filament holder on my Prusa i3.  4. One star subtracted because the spool had already become tangled once in the couple of prints I tried.  5. Bottom line, I would not recommend this filament.	-1
I initially thought that this filament was stringy and hard to print well, but after I used it some I think it is a beautify iridescent color with lots of depth.  I still think that its a bit stringy, but it looks so nice that I will overlook that little issue.  I will be getting more of this stuff.  And have!	1
I got pretty good results from this.  I typically order hatchbox PLA but went out on a limb to try something new with a better price :).  At first my prints were stringy but then I got eveyrthing dialed in nicely.  I printed these at 215 w/a heated bed temp of 60.  I do have a rather thick silicon pad so actual temp of bed may not be as hot as I'm setting it.  I'm printing with a maker select v2 (wanhao i3 clone) w/upgraded micro swis hot end and nozzle.  Also printing onto glass plate.	1
Used about half the spool so far and very happy with the filament. Printing parts for a 3DLABPrint RC airplane. The spool was well packaged, The filament has good layer adhesion, a great color for my application, and generally prints easy and consistent.	1
Good color and print quality	1
nice bright yellow and prints nicely with no troubles!	1
OMG give me more! Affordable and great to print with. I would do a review for you anytime. Extrudes like a high priced filament. I haven't seen any noticeable color or texture difference from 210 - 240 but I am still experimenting with it. Has not caused any jams and has a great look. Excellent filament for the price.	1
Sticks great, performs great. I'm fairly new to 3d printing, but I have had no problems with this PLA.	1
This filament is working great in my new Tronxy802 printer.  Have not had any filament grinding which I had on occasion with another brand of filament purchased on Amazon.  This appears to be a very consistent filament, feeds well, parts are very strong.  I've not several 3 hour prints and a 5+ hour print using this filament with no issues.  I had a couple of questions and the BAMtack support was VERY responsive and helpful.  I will definitely be buying more BAMtack filament in the near future.	1
Now that Hatchbox is almost impossible to find I had to find a replacement.  Bamtack is fitting the bill.  I have printed about 1/2 a roll and it is doing very good.  The Bamtack is rolled up perfectly.  I have not seen a filament roll that is roll so well.  The lines never cross.  Diamemeter is right on spec and the prints look great printing at about 215C	1
Wow!  Great stuff so far, super well packaged, first print with it came out phenomenal.  Very consistent flow with this stuff!  Love the yellow-gold, great color.	1
I ordered this Filament because I needed to replace another brand that I had a lot of difficulties with. I thought I would give BAMtack! a try. Sadly the day that the package arrived (on time by the way) my printer controller board shorted out. So I had nice new filament but no way to use it. After some conversations with support I was able to get the printer fixed and back up and running.  The first thing I reached for was the BAMtack! and it worked perfectly. The white color is fantastic and test prints came out spot on. I did have a little shrinkage compared to some of my other filament but nothing that made things not fit together. I have included a couple of pieces that I use for testing here.  I did ask the guys at BAMtack if they had or were getting into other filament besides PLA and they said they were later this year. I am definately going to be ordering again from them and look forward to their new products that come out in the future.	1
This is superior to some of the more common filaments.	1
Good stuff.  4 stars instead of 5 because of the incessant and excessive e-mail spamming!	1
Really nice color in this PLA.  Arrived in a timely way, and we love the box.	1
Filament worked great. I had no issues.	1
Awesome stuff.  Works well with my Gmax 1.5XT	1
Loved the color. Performed poorly on overhangs compared to Hatchbox white filament. Had brittleness issues	-1
This is the 2nd time I've orders bamtack. The first time the product worked fine but the color was not what was pictured. Being a large job I was printing I just went with it. I figured I'd give the black a try after pleasant experience with their customer service. 2 rolls had extra marking from Bamtack saying demensions were a bit further off than norm and the label got wet. No problems. 3rd roll into a 4 roll order and it had no extra sticker.  I loaded it up and went about my business. When I returned to the printer it was making horrible grinding noises, jammed at the extruded and a pellet was stuck in the hot end barrel. I sent bamtack a message and never heard back. This role was so far off that it jammed my hot end and has caused my machine to be down for 4 days while I wait on new barrels to fix the jam caused by their product being so large it wouldn't feed into the hot end.  There won't be a 3rd time trying bamtack, back to hatchbox for me!!!	-1
Good product. Quality print. Will buy more.	1
I've used 3 spools of the BAMtack! Gray now, and they have worked very well.  I print with a 50c-70c bed and 190c for the extruder.  I purchased a spool of BAMtack! Christmas Green.  My first print failed, but I increased the extrusion temperature from 190c  to 210c and it worked fine on the second attempt.  The Christmas Green is a little opaque, so I think that affected the extrusion temperature.  I had some problems at first with the Gray filament, but Matt at customer support did a great job of helping me diagnose my problem and fix it.  The final cause of the problem was that my print bed was too hot.  Great customer support.  BAMTack! is quickly replacing Hatchbox as my filament of choice.	1
I bought this in silver mainly to print some miniature tabletop dungeon tiles.  The first roll I had was kinked but the company replaced it quickly and without question.  The new roll has had no problems at all and I am very happy with it.  No clogs dispite hours and hours of printing out minis.  I am actually really impressed at the quality.  The customer service is top notch, the color is great (my dungeon doesn't even need painting unless I just want to spend more time on it) and the filament isn't brittle.  The packaging is really keen as well and adds to the experience of using this filament.  It comes vaccum packed.  I will be using the brown in this as well when I move on to the 'wood' parts of my miniature dungeon.  Thank you BAMtack for the great experience!	1
I had a really bad experience with E-sun brown filament where it was so brittle it snapped apart while other filaments had no problems.  Seems like it's actually hard to find brown color from suppliers (maybe the colorant affects the plastic?).  I used to use excelvan but it seems they've stopped making it too.  Bought this based on reviews, it flows beautifully and the final print actually feels just a tiny bit rubbery (but still very stiff).  At this price I may only stick to BAM filament from now on.	1
Based on other customer reviews and the general attitude of the company, I was very hopeful that I'd like this filament.  Wow - it's fantastic!  I was doing a big print job for my son - mostly a large mask to wear with a costume that I had to piece together.  I started with the Hatchbox white and ran out before I thought I would, so I switched to the BAMtack! white and was very, very pleased.  The experiences were very similar but this was more of a "true white" in color.  That didn't matter much to me because I coated and painted the mask after gluing it together, but it at least showed me the quality of the filament.  I then went onto print tiny skulls about 1" high and the detail, even on the teeth, was so much better than I expected it would be.  This is my favorite filament brand now.  The only thing that Hatchbox has over BAMtack is they have a sticker on the side of the box that shows the color of the filament (so you can see it when stacking somewhere and not have to write it on the box yourself).  Big deal.  It's the filament that matters so I will continue to buy this....but hey BAMtack! - how about putting a color sticker on your boxes? :)	1
This is good filament.  I was originally using Hatchbox filament but I couldn't get grey fast enough.  I decided to try this company and I'm glad i did.  It prints very consistently and i'm happy with the quality of the prints when im done.  I did have a couple air pockets in it, but overall, I still think its an incredible value for the price. Buying more from them.  Printer:RepRap Prusa I3 Filament Temp:200C Bed Temp:70C (Bed Ambient on first layer) Infill 35%	1
My second rol of filament and is great as ever to work with it :)	1
BAMtack! has become one of my goto filaments. I can count on smooth extrusion, good adhesion and a clean shiny part once the printing is over.	1
I have to admit that I was a little skeptical at first, but I am very pleased with the BAMtack and will buy more.  I currently have the white, yellow and lime green.  My favorite so far is the white.  The finish feels and looks like ivory or bone and is very hard to see the printed layers or lines.  I also found that on my Maker Select 3D printer that I got good prints at about 210 on the hot end and about 60 on the heated bed.  I have printed phone stands, lockers, and whistles with great clean results.	1

BAMtack filaments have been hit and miss, the red one here I gave 4 stars, as it was one of the only ones that came in that wasn't all dry and brittle and was still sealed tight. It was a little over 1.75mm, within their +/- 0.03 margin.  The only issue I had with this filament (hence, the 4 stars) was that it was tangled in 3 or 4 spots, which kills a 10 hour print.  However, a few failed prints, is common, usually due to printer, and not the filament roll.  The prints that came out, look great and the layers are so smooth its hard to see them.  I wish the two white packages I bought were the same.	1
This stuff is phenomenal. It retracts like a champion, and looks great no matter how much you beat it up. I used it to make the exterior of a Raspberry Pi touchscreen enclosure recently, and it's proven to be a durable PLA that just won't quit.	1
Works well with my Makergear M2, I printed it at 210c the first time and it left real fine spiderwebs  ( did not effect the print in anyway) so the second print I lowered it to 190c and it was perfect. I will say the black is slightly lighter in color and less gloss then the Makergear PLA. Measuring it in several places before feeding it the accuracy was +/- .01 mm, I will be buying this again. In the picture i printed the large Batman tumbler first at .2mm and didn't realize I had it printing at 200mm/sec with an untested filament until about halfway though. The second second small was printed at .1mm and 60mm/sec with PVA supports ( first time trying the PVA) the PVA stuck well to the kapton taped glass bed but did not adhere well directly on top of the PLA, as you can see at the back top, so more PVA tests to conduct. Bottom line this Bamtack PLA is worth the print.	1
I bought a Flashforge Creator Pro last week that came with one spool of black ABS and one of White. I started printing with that, trying various models from thingiverse.com with varying success. I also bought this BAMtack! white PLA at the same time, but didn't start using it until yesterday. I can't compare it to any other PLA (yet) since this is all I've used so far, but after printing the Celtic Skull in White ABS and then using this PLA, I can say the differences are pretty amazing.  It isn't an exactly fair test, since the ABS was printed at .3 mm layer height, which likely caused the layer splitting as the part cooled and the PLA was printed at .1 mm layer height, allowing more detail, but the important thing is the color difference. The one on the left was made with the BAMtack! White, and to paraphrase Spinal Tap, "How much whiter could it be? The answer is none... None more white." I thought the ABS was white before I printed with this PLA, now I can see it is really more of a greyish off-white.  The print quality and detail is really good, and it stuck to the build plate perfectly using mostly default Simplify3D settings. I bought this because it was among the cheapest PLA I could find on Amazon (I just wanted something to test PLA printing at the time) and I'd happily buy it again, the quality for this spool has been perfect so far.	1
PERFECT! best description, perfect color, not too shiny like hatchbox, and not dull like 3D4U, high quality will be my "GO TO" filament	1
Good, consisten filament in size and color. Printed well.	1
This is my 2nd time getting BAMtack filament and it won't be the last, I just wish they had black in stock. Their white filament is easily the whitest color I've seen compared to  other known filaments, It also has a nice shine to it after its printed. I have ran it through 190* all way up to 230* degrees and found that it rather likes 200-210* range the best.  I will be buying more again and again.	1
This was a great filament for a great price! Packaging was very nice, filament accuracy was great and I've not had issues at all.  I'll try some more in the future and update this review if anything comes up but so far so great!!	1
Does the job!	1
Great price and fast delivery to your house!	1
Great Buy!!!	1
Wow first time using these anchors and I'm impressed. Exceeded my expecyations	1
love this type of anchor.	1
good set and fair price	1
I love these! No stud? No problem just careful as the y make big holes. Also be careful if you go to remove the screw from the anchor sometime the anchors comes with it and could strip out the anchors hole leaving you with a big hole theta useles now. Can be prevented by greasing or oiling the screw before you screw in!	1
Nice set of screw anchors and screws, they work as expected	1
used these to hang pictures. They work very well, do not feel brittle, and have not had any of them snap off while driving them into the wall. They really make hanging a picture in the perfect location easy.	1
These things really work. Strong and easy to install even in 5/8 drywall. My only gripe is that the screws could use a wider head and be less finicky in regards to the screwdriver fit. An impact driver works best, but the driver tip must be correct and perfect. Pay a little attention to that and it is pretty much the perfect anchor.	1
Does the job without issue.	1
The handle is easy to use and the LCD screen is easy to read.  This works great for my wife who is always on the ragged edge of being overweight with her checked bag.  It's so much better that a home scale.  I had something similar and it was awkward to hold and see the weight. When you are living 50 lbs straight up, this is the device you want.	1
Again a device with more uses than just weighing luggage. I plan to use in my shop to weigh some of my prototypes, especially those too bulky to be accurately weighed on a scale.	1
Must have for traveling.  Easy to use, quick readings.  Just loop the strap around the handle of your suitcase and hook back on the scale.  The scale is pretty quick also, once it decides what the weight is, it stops on the value.  This has saved me the embarrassment plenty of times from having to open my suitcase and take out a few things to be at about 50 pounds.	1
A must for every serious traveler.	1
Sturdy, solid material. I liked it enough to order another a little wider for another project on a big door.	1
I purchased this over a year ago to make inner fender extensions after doing a body lift.  I left the rubber sheet laid out on some pallets in the weather all that time, so it got exposed to the elements.  There was one tear caused by UV rays and my leaving it folded - all my fault.  I finally made the extensions, and wish I had done it sooner!  I don't have to listen to so much injector ticking now!!  This stuff is nice and thick, but easily cut.  I ordered another sheet to do the rear of my truck.	1
worked great for gate seal	1
ok	1
Great, Works very good	1
a little cumbersome to use but will work, make sure to have a new blade when cutting.	1
I used this with a MPCNC machine and found  that using the endstop hookups would cause the board to reboot.  At the time I was using programs on the SD card.  Later I attached it directly to my new laptop and when an endstop was hit, it sent 12v to my USB port and fried the laptop.  I suspect I got one of the Ramps boards with the known 12v rail issue.  I won't by cheap again, it cost me a 2 week old $700 laptop.  Buy a good quality board, it's not worth the risk.	-1
Exactly as promised	1
thanks	1
Good quality	1
Ok first off, Arduion is the only way to go in my opinion when doing a 3D printer.  Melzi boards are horrible and when they fail there is virtually no support.  So with that said, if you are going to build, upgrade, or otherwise use a 3d printer, buy an Arduino.  I loved this setup since it came with everything but there were some serious problems.  Arduino support is much more widely available and not to mention the parts are very cheap to purchase.  #1 - Two of the stepper controller chips appeared to be burned out right out of the box.  Fortunately these are easily replaceable so I bought an extra pack.  #2 - The Arduino board itself worked wonderfully until the bootloader somehow got corrupted on the 3rd attempt to upload Marlin.  So I had to purchase a USB adapter to reprogram it.  #3 - The LCD appeared to have some burned out pixels so I will be replacing this eventually as it is pretty annoying.  I still give this purchase 4/5 stars though.  It is a very good price for what you get.  I do highly recommend buying extra stepper controller chips to hang onto as a backup.  This kit does not come with endstops like many other kits but usually your stock endstops are compatible like mine were on my RepRap kit.  I purchased some additional ones anyway since I plan on taking advantage of max endstops since RAMPS supports it.  I probably would still purchase this same kit again even in hindsight as it gets the job done as long as you know what you are doing.	1
There wasn't a heatsink on the mosfet used for the heatbed. After a few seconds of running my printer, there was the odor of burning electrical components. A little longer and smoke was coming off the mosfet and it melted the green wire melts next to it. It seems to work OK after replacing the mosfet and adding a heatsink and cooling fan. The memory is close to be used up after installing the Repetier firmware.	-1
This product is perfect if you are building a 3D Printer. Everything works exactly as intended. The connectors were all straight and everything fit correctly. When I build my next printer I will be buying this set again. Very good quality, delivered fast, and overall exactly what I wanted.	1
Great product and price. I had a few questions and received immediate help. Thanks!	1
Worked then didn't. Not sure what happened but It stopped working in the middle of the first print. Two of the stepper drivers fried. They were not installed wrong and did work for about 2 hours.  Replaced it and the next one worked well. I purchased them both because I didn't have time to go through the replacement procedure. If it would have worked like my second set review would have been different.	-1
This is my second RAMPS board.  Using it to drive a multi-purpose CNC machine.  I had no issues whatsoever with my board and the price was exceptional.  The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is that when I swapped out the drivers for DRV8825's, the display dimmed and I ended up putting the original drivers back.  My steppers are rated at 2 amps and I was able to adjust the VREF to match them, so the DRV8825's were really not needed anyway.	1
I purchased this offering of 20PCS Photoresistor GL5537 5537 LDR Photo Resistors to experiment and build an Satelite dish actuator driven solar panel mover.  These Photo Resistors are the heart of the circuit I am working on for this purpose.  They are a reasonably priced component that works as it is designed to give a resistance when the cell is pointed directly at the light source and changes as the angle of the light source changes as the source moves to the side as the sun does when it moves across the sky from morning to evening. I will build a circuit that can drive the actuators to move the solar panels I will use to optimum position for the panel and  make optimum power, throughout the day.  These photo resisters are perfect for my circuit.  Good price at $5.50 for 20, especially when they come with free shipping.  If I had to go somewhere to buy them, I'd spend that in gas for the vehicle I drive.  Every purchase needs this reasoning.  If you spend a dollar to save snot, you don't need to blow your nose!  Anyhow, this worked for me.	1
Works as advertised	1

Definitely resists photos	1
Product was as advertised, quality seems good.	1
just what i need for home arduino project. great price.	1
a useful item for the begginer	1
Hey, they change resistance based on the intensity of the light falling on it.  That's what we want.  They all seem to be pretty close in resistance under a given light source and the price is great.	1
Great price, and 100% worked correctly! Resistance in bright artificial light were all around 1.5K, and varying darkness over 20k. I suspect way over 20k, but it wasn't convenient to make it real dark.	1
These work as expected. The only trouble was the shipping package. these were insinde a box with several other items. Of course the box was crushed along the way and the photocells (unprotected) took most of the force. they were bent all to H. E. double hockey sticks. but i was able to use what i needed.	1
Product as advertised, detects a laser or ambient light without issue.  I'm using in a microcontroller application, and it needs an amplifier to register the changes I'm looking for.  Interested to use this for a laser-beam data system, but have not experimented with it yet.	1
Update 10/17/17 : Just installed on a Q3D Threeup prusa i3 style. Made my own bracket of course, can email the image to whoever needs it. AMAZING extruder. This is my first direct style extruder all ive had prior is bowden setups. Retraction is great, spring works great. Very pleased with how this is running. I bought 2 so I could install it on my 3ft printer too.	1
good buy	1
This is an incredibly useful learning tool; it is not only useful for visually illustrating fractions (a tough topic for even certain grown-ups much less kids), but the construction is tough and will stand up to use. I really love how the fractions on one side is buttressed by the associated decimals on the other. Brilliant and five stars.	1
These tiles are double-sided with fractions on one side and decimals on the other. They're easy to use and have fun colors. I do sixth through eighth grade math, and this product is very helpful. One complaint I have is that they're only attached together with a sticky sheet. The side that has the sheet on it looks really ugly, and if you take a tile off it won't really stick on anymore. But it's been awesome for illustrating some of our math problems.	1
These are fun learning tiles for children.  They come in colored pieces and they all have the corresponding number of pieces to fractions.  They are color coded so you don't mix them up.  They are rigid plastic and withstand abuse.  The tiles are easy to read and helps my toddlers learn fractions.  However, the tiles are just plastic and do not have magnets or anything.  They do not click together or anything like that.  It also just comes in a plastic bag so you will need a better storage solution.  They are great visual tools, and I enjoy using them with my toddlers.	1
HANDS-ON LEARNING  These tiles help kids touch and see the various parts (fractions and decimals) that make ONE. These tiles support the board work and worksheets we use to teach and grasp the piece parts that equal 1. Colorful pathways to learning	1
These are an EXCELLENT way to teach fractions and decimals. Kids who prefer dealing in concepts rather than tangible things will still enjoy these, but visual learners, kinetic learners, and kinesthetic learners, are going to love these. With a Masters degree in education, I get frustrated with teachers who try to force students to learn fractions and decimals using only worksheets. Although some children learn well with worksheets, many do not. These are a great solution to help kids who prefer learning with manipulatives. The actual product is well-made and should last a long time.	1
Works as intended	1
good price works ok	1
Does a great job at constricting around the object being shrink wrapped. Heavy duty stuff. Very happy, used this stuff on an electric cooling fan for my sons truck.	1
Not sure about this.  It says dual wall but one side feels thick and other half side thin.  I'm using this around a battery cable, around 3/8 thick and this shrinks tight around it.	1
the stuff stuck together every where it was bent I guess from the high temp needs to be powder coated to prevent this. I needed pieces 11 3/4 long so this did not work mine were only around 6 inches	-1
3/4"  Adhesive Lined  Heat Shrink. Works fine.	1

as advertised, and arrived on time	1
The best glass deal on Amazon. The lead time is a bit long, but if you have the time to wait, this set is a gorgeous deal for the money. No bubbles in any of the glass(wish SEOH could figure that trick out), everything was delivered well packaged and in tact. My only complaint is that the thermometer doesn't reach the bottom of the 500mL boiling flask. Swapped it out for a two-necker with a thermometer port and it's been smooth sailing since. What a great starter kit for a hobbyist.	1
Delivery took awhile, but all parts arrived unbroken and individually wrapped. The glass is clear and free from flaws. The neck joints are well ground and all parts fit perfectly. Thumbs up.	1
Super great deal!	1
Amazing price! Nicely made glassware, and well packed for the long journey from China. Also, the flasks are heavy walled, which is great for longevity in the lab.	1
I haven't used them yet, I plan to do a simple experiment to make sure the products can handle heat, but everything appears to be exactly as described.	1
This product is as advertised.	1
Very good product and very good service.	1
Decent value, nice little assortment of different sized wall anchors to have onhand.	1
Very cheap, not meant for anything major just simple wall screws not meant for wood or metal.	-1
Came as expected	1
A good assortment in a compact case.  Very pleased.	1
Lots of different sizes and lengths.  Worked perfectly for me.	1
Exactly what I needed to put up some things on our dry wall. What's amazing is this cost me the prices if I were to buy 2 screws from a hardware store.	1
Basic set of anchors and associated screws. Good value and a good item to have around the house.	1
Awesome little kit for the price. I won't be able to use some of these anchors, but it's still helpful.	1
Nice array of sizes.	1
Good assortment for most wall mounting jobs and a good little case to keep it all in place and use it for other storage once depleted.	1
Very useful kit ..3 jobs done already ..	1
Great price	1

I have used pumice stones for years. This is one of the best so far. It wears down enough to produce a form for getting in the odd shaped holes in the commode, but still remains intact when one needs to scrub hard. Due to hard water my commodes need to be pumiced twice a week. I used about 1/4 of it. this week. Other stones I used used almost the entire stone.  I have one for just other porcelain items and I am quite pleased with the results. The pricing is good and my item I received was exactly as advertised. I will definitely use this seller to reorder.	1
Lasts longer than the coarse grey stones. Just keep it wet and all your mineral stains will come off.	1
Anthony Boyd, the owner of Park City Products, doesn't think everyone gets up in the morning thinking of pumice.  :-))  We are kindred spirits, Tony!  I live on the side of a volcano.  My farm is built on lava. I think about pumice!!  Well, maybe not 24/7 anymore, but I DO think about it!  So let's do a review of your products:  I LOVE THEM!  I bought a few months' supply of very fine pumice from you for scrubbing my...back.  Actually, I'm kind of surprised that it's SO fine that it doesn't rip my skin to shreds!  Whoda thunk?!  It's perfect for a thousand uses.  I wasn't shopping for the weaponized grade at the time..the heavier grit stuff...but I am going to do that right now.	1
This pumice works really well. Holds up well yet will conform(wear) to the proper shape in short order. I personally like that it does not have a handle so that I can get up under the rim of the bowl and in tighter places. Have used pumice both with and without handle and it seems to me that this is more versatile. The four pack is a good quantity to start with especially if you have a multiple cleaning projects. Will buy again when more needed.	1
This is a good little camera.  I has an adjustable LED light - which helps view in dark places - inside walls for me works perfect  This can be taped directly on any type of "Fish" and can go inside the walls or pipes	1
Not worth buying.  Didn't work with my computer and didn't want to go through hassel to return.  I might not even know where it is now since it never worked!  HAHA Pretty bad that it is bad enough that I misplaced it since i never used it.  I don't think I would purchase it for even a gag gift exchange!  I gave it a 2 start simply for the innovative idea!	-1
I had another Crenova product which worked well and for a nominal price got this one. Frankly it is fantastic! It is a long fiber optic device with a camera on the end and with led lights around the periphery of the camera. The video, still and motion, is reasonably good. I use it to examine various animal and plant species and it does exactly what I required.  1. The software comes on a disk. I reloaded it to a file on my PC and opened it there. If you try to load the disk it assumes the disk is where it is on your PC and then tries to write to the disk. Won't work. You must have a separate location on your PC and remember where it was to load it each time.  2. If you do not have the fiber loop connected it will first bring up your camera. Then when you connect the loop with USB it brings up the loop automatically. Have not tried my existing SW and see if it recognizes the loop cameras, it should.  3. Make sure you have a file set to store video or pics. You and get lots very fast. Also video is stored MPEG.  4. The fiber band is supported with some material that allows it to be snaked down various entries, such as a chipmunk hole. One can get some interesting naturalist type video this way. Not to mention aggravating the chipmunk!  Overall for the price it is fantastic. Worth the but, even a spare!	1
First, I received this as a free replacement to an older model Endo from Crenova. I'm giving this a 4 star rating even though it has quite a few issues. The reason for this is that most of the things I've found won't affect it's use for the majority of people.  Pros: *The flat cable is easy to roll up and store but it's also stiff enough to be beneficial when needed. The picture quality is very good for what it is, it's an Endoscope not a camera. *The USB adapter to change from type A to a Micro works very nicely and it will keep you from losing it. *It works with the built in Camera software in Windows 10  Cons: *It gets very hot at the tip with the LEDs on and I don't see anyway to turn these off. *The attachments are totally worthless, the magnet isn't strong enough to lift anything other than a very small screw. The mirror is too small, most of what fills the view is the outline of the mirror itself and not what you're trying to inspect. The hook I received won't even attach to the Endo, it's slightly too small to fit around. *The included software can't be run from the CD, if you do it won't let you exit the program since it can't save a file. The only way out is to use the Task Manager in Windows to end the task. I consider the Windows Camera software to be easier to use so this shouldn't be a problem. If you do decide to use it just copy it to your hard drive first. *The focal distance is about 1.5 inches, and it wiggles around a lot while trying to insert it making it difficult to get a good, in-focus, picture.  Attached Pictures: *Two of the pictures are inside of a Bose Sub-woofer and show the harsh brightness in one while I changed the exposure setting in Widows Camera app for the other one which I prefer. *To give you a relative idea of size, I've included a picture of some Micro SD Cards *Finally, the Jabra picture was taken at an angle to show a little bit of the Depth of Field or how much will be in focus and how quickly does it drop off.  Hope this helps you make your decision...	1
Given the price, I didn't have high expectations for this device. But I'm very happy with it. It's great quality, easy to use, and so much fun that I keep looking for places to use it. It works well inside things and in hard-to-access places. It allows a closer view than an older scope I have. The light works well.  This product is great for carpenters, electricians, plumbers, etc. who need to see inside a wall. It's also great for mechanics to see inside an engine or to view hard to see areas in the engine compartment. I even used it to look up & behind a dashboard without having to open it up. A naturalist can use it to explore holes in the ground, look down inside flowers, peer into holes in trees, and so forth. Lots of uses around the home, too, such as finding things that fell in the narrow crack behind the dresser (which somehow sucks my pens, coins, and other things down into the abyss).	1
The model I received is the one with the standard USB connector that splits open to reveal a micro USB plug inside. This is opposed to a model some commenters have that has a long USB plug that has a brightness control built into it. My model has no way to dim the six tiny LEDs on the end of the camera.  Cable is 14 feet long. It is flat and a bit more than 1/4" wide and about 3/32" thick. It's flexible and cannot hold up the weight of the camera if extended. I like the flat cable because by holding the flat cable the camera's image is either upright or inverted. A round cable doesn't help you figure which way is up. By attaching the camera to a stick or wire you can extend it into a larger space. One tool professional wiring people use to pull or push speaker wire in ceilings is an extendable fiberglass pole that's about 1/8" thick, but quite rigid.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/33-Electric-Fiberglass-Wire-Pull-Rods-Fish-Tape/dp/B005LW4CFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">33' Electric Fiberglass Wire Pull Rods Fish Tape</a>. I plan to tape the camera to the end to control the camera's movement in closed spaces.  To view the image on a Windows 10 laptop, I inserted the supplied 3" mini-CD and copied the two .exe files to my desktop. They are called Smart Camera.exe and Amcap.exe. There's also a pdf of the owner's manual, but it's in Chinese and not much use. The tiny paper manual isn't very good either, as it shows two models. One side of the paper illustrates the model I have. The other side illustrates the model with the larger USB plug that has the dimmer dial on it.  The camera's metal housing runs pretty warm to the touch as it has its six built in LEDs running at full brightness and the camera itself produces some heat. The camera housing is about 3/8" in diameter and about 2" long. The flat cable comes out of the back of the camera tube. I may reinforce the cable with a piece of shrink tubing or silicon seal, but it's pretty durable. Have not tested waterproofness.  To use the software, after the software is dropped onto the desktop, I plug in the camera and then double click on the AMCAP.exe icon on the desktop. A window opens and a few seconds later the image appears. If you go to Options:Video Capture Pin.... you can control resolution. 320x240, 640x480 (default) and 720x1280. The 320x240 and 640x480 are 4:3 aspect ratio. 720x1280 is a 16:9 aspect ratio. All resolutions deliver an image with proper shapes. In other words, regardless of which resolution, square objects are square, not stretched or squeezed. By clicking on the standard Expand icon in the upper right of the frame the picture will fill your computer screen. The 720p resolution will look the best and the 320x240 resolution will be very coarse. My Core i7 laptop easily handles 720p.  You can record video or stills with either one of the exe's but Smart Camera appears to work only at 640x480. By fiddling with settings you can record at 720p using AMCAP.  Accessories include a fabric pull-string storage bag that's too small, a clip with a magnet, a clip with a hook and a clip with a small mirror that can be attached to the end of the camera. There's also a micro USB to USB-C adapter, if you need to plug the camera into a C-type socket. This is probably for if you wish to attach it to a newer Android phone.  Overall the image is very sharp if you position the camera about 2-1/4" inches from the subject. At infinity the picture is very blurry but helpful for general positioning. You really need to get the camera close for maximum quality. The field of view while in focus is about 2" wide. Great if you want to inspect the hair follicles on the back of your neck!  It works very well with my Windows laptop and with a 14-ft cable, it has good reach. And the price is outstanding. I like it.  I wish it had dimming LEDs, in case I wanted to turn them off, but overall it works very well, easily and reliably so far.	1
Good value at $26/ea and not it is on sale for $22/ea! Every one has dark holes which need to be explored. This is a very good tool for that. The fixed focus is at about 7cm. This is suitable for seeing obstructions in pipes or underneath something. However it would not be useful if you are trying to focus on items smaller than 5mm.	1
Not the highest quality camera, but extremely high value. I have been finding uses for it everywhere since I got it.	1
Good product.	1

Used it to find out what type of critters were hiding under my back deck (raccoons). Shortly after, used it to inspect underneath a fiberglass shower pan. Then snaked it down a drain pipe. Hundreds of uses.  I use it with my Android phone (Nexus 5) with a $4 USB OTG female connector and CameraFi (free app). Works great!  Only wish that it had a semi-rigid flex neck like some inspection cameras, but that's nothing a coat hanger and some electrical tape can't solve.  See attached video of "coon hunting".	1
Bought this to detect engine oil leak on 2001 Celica GTS.  But, even though I liked using it, and am glad I bought it, I just couldn't find the leak using it.	1
Very cool. Though the instructions admonish you from "personal inspection" several times, you'll find yourself inspecting all kinds of creepy things. Just because you can. What do fillings look like up close? What do your tonsils really look like?  On a serious nature, the very next day after I received it I wanted to inspect the innards of a chair leg to see how water got into it. A quick scoping later I had my answers.  The included software makes it easy to take high quality video, and or stills (though the video files, mov format, are huge!).  There's not much color in the attached pictures from the chair leg (I'll spare you the tonsils), but the device is full color and includes a good ring of adjustable LEDs for lighting.	1
I had a small inconsistent leak from an upstairs bathroom and needed to see between the floors to find the source of the leak.  I had a small gap between a vent fan in the bathroom below the leaking one and the ceiling. I tried peeking in but it was too dark and narrow.  I figured an inspection camera could get the job done.  I originally looked at expensive endoscope/inspection cameras in big box stores and ultimately bought one for nearly two-hundred dollars.  Although it had a built-in screen, it was small, dark and the resolution was terrible.  Also, the head of the camera was too large to easily squeeze in most places where it was most needed.  I tried three different locations; the gap between the ceiling fan, a gap between a pipe and sink in the upstairs bathroom, and a gap between floorboards from a bit farther away.  Between the camera being too large to easily fit in those small openings, the poor resolution of the screen making it virtually impossible to distinguish important clues such as wet wood versus dry wood and the stiffness of the camera cable, it was a fruitless attempt.  The camera was absolutely no help whatsoever and went back to the store the next morning.  I ordered this the next day and have been happy from the moment I opened the box.  Yes, the instructions are practically worthless but you don't really need them unless you want to do certain things beyond examining hard to reach areas.  I connected it to my Windows 10 PC and was off and running via plug and play.  The bundled disk has software that helps you record video and snap pictures, but you can already do all this natively in Windows via the camera app.  If you have Windows 10, make sure you open the camera app and switch to the endoscope if you already have a built-in camera or other camera attached.  The head of the scope is small and narrow enough to easily reach those hard to access areas.  It slid in the gap between the fan much easier than the more expensive camera.  It also provided a much clearer image on my laptop than the tiny screen on the handheld "pro" camera.  I can take snapshots or video and narrate as I explore.  The laptop's mic records the sound.  The images are clear and it has already helped me much more than the original inspection camera that cost close to ten times the price.  It's not without it's cons compared to handheld inspection cameras.  The biggest con is the requirement for a laptop.  Although the 5 meter cord is long enough to easily reach from the laptop to the majority of places I want to inspect, you have to either figure a way to use/reach the laptop while using the camera or make it a two-person job, one to operate the camera and one to take pictures/video on the laptop.  As grainy and useless as the built-in screen of the handheld was, it at least gave the flexibility of accessing it as you operated the camera.  However, with that as the only pro for the more expensive camera, it's definitely worth going with this and just having someone help you or maybe positioning the laptop as nearby as safely possible.  I had no problems with this on a Windows 10 PC.  I haven't tried it on my Mac yet but since it basically works the same as a webcam, I seriously doubt I'd have any issues on my Mac.  I also tried it on a Chromebook but it did not work.  The camera physically worked but I couldn't get it to show up on screen.  It may be possible but I don't absolutely need it to work on a Chromebook, so I left it alone after that.  Just tried it out for review purposes.  I am so glad that original expensive inspection camera was disappointing.  If not, I'd be a couple hundred dollars poorer with, in my mind, an inferior product for my specific needs.	1
I followed another reviewers directions to get this to work with my MacBook Pro.  It worked exactly as advertised using VLC.  This is an incredible bargain for the price.  The tiny LED lights put out a lot of light.  This is a fixed focus camera so don't expect to make movies with it, but it works very well for it's intended purpose.  I plan to make a little stand so I can hold it steady to look closely at small print.  It is like a camera on macro setting as it focuses very close.  Now I can look into those dark scary places!  The attached photo captured by VLC was hand held so there is motion blur but you can see how closely it focuses.	1
It did the trick- I dropped a whole set of keys down a hole where the wall meets floor (old building) - taped a thick gauge electric wire to the camera cord to give it some rigidity- was able to retrieve keys-- they were about 4ft deep. Software install was easy. just wish the lens had a wider angle and better focal range... but for the price i guess you can't beat it.	1
I needed to look inside my wall to check plumbing lines and I didn't want to spend the extra money for a separate little display.  This little guy did the trick!  And the cord is so long I didn't have to bring my laptop anywhere near the water.  I just set the laptop on a counter about 6 feet away and I could see everything just fine.  The lights are bright when on full.  The lights get a little warm but not enough to cause concern -- just FYI.	1
I give it 2 stars because the wheel seems to cut fine and stay cooler than the wheels my grinder came with but, it does wobble quite a bit. Definitely not true. Hopefully not enough to damage my grinder. Not worth sending it back minus the shipping. I will just keep it. A lesson learned. You get what you pay for!	-1
great stone for that finish look	1
Put it on my HD grinder for lathe tools, perfect fit, great results as advertised. Highly recommend for wood turning HSS tools.	1
Nice but not perfect. hole is slightly oversized causing the wheel to run slightly out of true, but a quick pass with a diamond dresser brought it back into true round and eliminated the slight vibration caused by the out of round wheel. Very smooth cutting and leaves a very sharp edge on my wood turning tools. Excellent investment.	1
This wheel had quite a bit of wobble when installed.  That's correctable, but even after taking the wobble out and dressing the wheel with a diamond dressing tool to make the wheel concentric, this grinding wheel would not balance.  The vibration was such that I could not run my grinder at anything but at its slowest speed.  Iv'e never had this issue with a grinding wheel before.  Returned the wheel for a refund.	-1
The grinding wheel works ok doesn't work well for carbide tools.	1
Got hedge & tree branch trimmers so sharp they slice thru single sheet of  newspaper	1
GREAT ITEM...I AM VERY PLEASE	1
Works well with my vari delta grinder. No complaints, as advertised - good prie	1
good product!	1
Awesome product	1
great	1
Great packaging.  Don't hesitate to buy.	1
A huge selection of resistor values, great for any hobbyist project.	1
Resitors, either work or they dont. Havent had any duds.	1
Purchased to resupply my hobby stocks.  I checked a random sampling of them, mine are within the stated tolerance.	1
Great resistor kit for projects. Nice to have different values for testing.	1
Nicely packed and it has what it is supposed to have.	1
Looks like it is all here. Good resistor kit and a good price.  Will let you know if I have any problems but all seems great.  Haven't tested them but they look good and arrived on time and are labeled.  Thanks for the plastic container.  It may come in handy for a project box.	1
Great price and good selection of resistors. I like that each package is individually labeled (And NOT by hand).	1
They work great.  I got a bunch of hand held electronics up and running.  Thanks :)	1
great value and assortment.  all tested perfectly in range	1
Good price, quality.	1
Perfect for all my electronics. Solid construction.	1
Very handy assortment. I'm glad they are sorted and bagged and tagged. Makes for easy selection.	1
thanks	1
OK product	1
Not only is this the best price I've seen on a variety of resistors, they're all 1% tolerance (most are 5%). You get a lot of every value, and a huge variety. They're all beautifully packaged and organized. I took all my other resistors and packed them into this box. They're easy to find and I've saved space in my electronics box.  They were not sorted by value, so I had to do that by hand. Also, didn't come with 68 ohm resistors, but it has every other resistor value I've cared to use.	1
I paid $12 for these little breadboards. Mini breadboards are key for building little robots and come in handy when you just need a small space on something to connect some wires or sensors. All the breadboards came like in the picture. One of each color. They are not broken or anything and they all work so, yeah.	1
Solid product. I taught a class and used over 200 of them and they worked well with long term poking and prodding.	1
The pins are not just stiff, many of the holes do not even accept a lead of any sort, chip pin or header.  If it just required some wiggling I'd be OK with that because of the price, but it really doesn't have 170 tie points. It has 170 holes in the plastic outer case, and maybe 100 usable tie points randomly distributed, with many whole rows totally unusable.	-1
alway good to have.	1
stupifyingly long shipping time but as described. i mean, castles have been built in less time but if you're willing to wait for the next major geological era to come about then by all, means, save the 80 cents	1
Excellent products.  Added these to my projects and thanks to their small size I could add them to any projects I was working on!!!!  Excellent!	1
I use the big pincushion breadboards but sometimes I need a little bit more space or I just have a small project. I've already used all 6 of these and am ready to buy more. I'm pleased.	1
I bought these boards to help me learn my Arduino.  They can be connected together with the integrated clips either long ways width ways or both ways. Great for making modules and adding them on to another circuit. Suggest pairing this purchase with the hook up wire set. Makes bread boarding much easier.	1
These are really great...the only weird thing about them is that I've bought about fifteen of these packages before and some of the boards are a different species...they are made from a slightly different plastic (no big deal), but there are at least two different species of dovetails (which are incompatible with one another) and at least one species without any dovetails at all. If you're planning on linking these little breadboards, that could be a problem.  However every pack of six that I've gotten has been compatible within its self...as in when I get six they are all the same type (dovetail type 1, dovetail type 2, or no dovetail at all).  Weird, I realize, but this isn't annoying unless you're buying in larger lots like me so only one point off.	1
Great for the price. The boards aren't the greatest, but they work well.	1
Very handy for prototyping as a little terminal strip or component holder. Used two of them in my MechE senior design project.	1
Excellent quality, must have if you want to leave your experiment on this board.	1
Fit perfectly on the proto-shield. Good quality, the pins are tight unlike some of the others I have ordered.	1
Phantom YoYo 170 Points Mini Breadboard , love the size for ad dons to my small bots for the price.	1
Nice to have a few of these around for quick and dirt small projects.	1
Great for small projects. Each board measures 1.85 x 1.37in. Cool that it fits exactly an arduino micro or metro mini. Nice for testing small modules. Contacts are smooth and firm and interconnecting the boards to get a larger footprint is easy.	1
Great little board for small projects. They come with an adhesive back.	1
excellent always need breadboards	1
Great price and value	1
Exactly as pictured.  Delivered on time or ahead of schedule.  Very pleased.	1

sorry to say it but this item is good if you have no 3D experience at all, its limits are staggering, basically you will outgrow it fast, and realize how little it can prints out of the vast stuff that are available out there to print! i bought it to test for classroom project and out of 5 items randomly printed, 3 lifted, even with painter tape, 2 lifted even with brim set. the settings are all at min. like for example when selecting brim you have no choice of percentage, or type, a lack of cooling control in the software not even sure if it has a cooling fan for printed parts. just a lot of short comings, including that it has proprietary filaments spool holder, or at least not the standard to others on the market, easy to override by printing different spool holder but still, buyers should know this, its spools are ave 30.00 for .5kg while better quality spool are 20.00 for 1kg. i am not an expert to any degree, but i do have 3 different printers, and this by far was the worst one, i am just glad i didn't buy it and its for a project. i will say i do like 2 things about it, 1 it has auto bed leveling, 2 its has excellent wifi control. but these 2 are not that necessary, as bed leveling is a pain but done once like every 6mths to a year for me, so i can easily live without it, and 2 wifi is great but you stuck with it limited slicing software, which make the whole experience awful, so much so that it outweigh any benefits these two advantage offers. for a 5.9 plate build printer it be better to go with the Maker Select Mini sold here by Monoprice. i know its has less stars review, but i can guarantee you be happier as it will work with you from beginner level to intermediate, in short it just has better control, easier to upgrade as there is a huge community of support on thingiverse etc.and  its parts are more oem specific, so replacement parts are easily located, for flashforge ? i cant seem to get any thing unless it via Flashforge.  so to sum up, its non heated bed, limited control via  software and use of many proprietary parts , makes it not a user friendly printer, especially once you get any knowledge under your belt, there is just no room to grow with this printer, and at 400.00 is pretty steep when a 200.00 item can easily trumps it! just my advice for any beginner looking at this printer.	-1
Edit: over a month in, and everything went to pieces. My success rate dropped from a wonderful 99% to 10%. The first issue came when prints would have a random or specific layer just get completely messed up, no bonding, and the rest of the print infill would be messed up entirely. Using different filaments, different Gcode files, different .stl files, the problem is really bad. So I updated my program and firmware, had an immediate jam with FlashForge red filament. Had to disassemble the entire print head to extract the piece. The same day had another jam with Hatchbox filament. Then I couldn't manage to get the build plate level or the extruder in the same place reliably, it would make an unholy grinding sound and sometimes, randomly, the build plate would be entire inches away from the head when it starts extruding.  I got in touch with FlashForge support, who were mildly helpful but never got any of the severe issues resolved. Every time I tried one of their fixes, it either didn't help or got worse. It drives me mad because it WAS working amazingly well, and now is almost unusable. Entirely disappointing, I'll be returning this shortly.  Notes: I have gotten successful prints, I do know how to level the print bed, I'm good with troubleshooting devices. It's my job to fix smartphones. The photos include all my recent failures, and this doesn't include the innumerable times the print just extruded into thin air, didn't stick to the plate, or was jammed so hard into the plate that it didn't print 3 layers.  -end edit-  2 weeks in, so far, so good. Been really enjoying using it so far, I've been printing near nonstop with it. I'd say without a shadow of doubt that this is the most newbie-friendly printer on the market. I did a huge amount of research on which printer to get, since this is my first endeavor into 3D printing, and this seemed like the best blend of simplicity and affordability. There are cheaper printers, yes, but they're usually DIY which seem very finicky and time consuming. This printer is very simple to set up, I had my first print completely done in under 45 minutes from receiving the UPS box.  Setup When I received the printer, it came well packaged with a lot of styrofoam and clips. Be sure to get all the packaging off. After plugging it in and setting up the packaged spool of filament (mine was red), I leveled the build plate (which in itself is a easy and guided process) and printed the included 20mm cube. It printed the cube in 11 minutes, and it was extraordinarily difficult to get off the build plate. I had to mangle the poor cube to get it off the plate. Maybe I goofed up or something, but since then I've been using 3M blue printers tape. I use a pocket knife to pry prints off the build, which works well. Side note, turning down the temperature to 210c (from my experience) helps keep the prints from fusing to the plastic.  Filaments I tried to get a pretty wide range of colors when I initially bought the printer. I was guessing that I'd get red with the printer, as other people have, so I ordered: (not sponsored just recommendations) -FlashForge Green, 0.67kg -HatchBox Yellow, 1kg -HatchBox Blue, 1kg -ProMolt Professional Black, 1kg -Solutech Real Wite, 1kg I've had great success with all of those filaments. You can use the 3rd party spools no problems, but I'd recommend a spool holder. I got a cheap one from Hatchbox, has worked great for everything I'd needed. The only filaments I've had any issues with (and they're minor) have been the FlashForge filaments, they work good on a technical level but they're fairly transparent. If that's what you want, great, but just be aware that it doesn't look as nice for figures or statues (in my opinion). Loading and unloading filaments has been a bit unusual, I haven't figured out how to pull the filament out of the extruder head so I just cut the filament off right at the input, then select Settings > Filament > Load, wait for it to heat up, then extrude that inch or two of plastic out. It works pretty well and takes under a minute, you just feed the new filament in behind it. Haven't had any issues with the filament clogging or anything, though at high temps like 220c (where it preheats to by default) it does slowly drip out in little strings. Be sure to clear those before you print.  Print Bed Print bed seems a bit small in terms of other 3D printers, but I've made due. Usually you can scale down or slice models to fit on the bed. Be aware that 5.5" cubed isn't massive, but can get the job done for most things. I haven't tried printing directly onto the print bed since my very first 20mm cube, and I had a heck of a time getting that cube off. I've been using 3M blue painters tape since then, and have had a lot more success with it. Be sure to turn the temperature down, 220c is a bit too hot and will want to fuse with the painters tape. If I get lucky I can pop the print off the tape and reuse the tape, though usually I replace the tape every print or two.  Software The bundled software is great. It's not a 3D modeling program, but it's great to taking models and quickly converting them into printable models. It's a requirement, as far as I know, before you can print something. I use a MacBook Pro, and the software works pretty great. I'd recommend changing some of the default print settings, like turning infill down to 10% or 5%, and turning the temperature down. I'm running at 210c, though I want to experiment with 200c. The tree-like auto supports are great, they're usually pretty easy to remove and help keep complex builds nice and secure. However, I really don't like rafts. They rarely come off in one piece and are frustratingly strong to remove. Especially on models that have a solid bottom, it just fuses with the bottom. I've had no issues printing the supports directly onto the print bed, so that's what I'd recommend. The on-printer software, accessed via touchscreen, is great too. Very user friendly and easy to operate, it's nice to be able to access a bunch of settings right on the printer. Plus preheating and selecting a print is easy too. It copies the print to the printer's internal hard drive, so once the print starts you can unplug your computer or unplug the flash drive with no problem.  PLA Plastic This printer only prints in PLA. Some would consider this a negative, I don't have a problem with it though. Personally speaking, as a newbie to printing, PLA is the only plastic I'm interested in. It's very easy to work with, you don't have to deal with a heated print bed or finicky fan speeds or anything like that. PLA prints don't tend to warp if the temperature isn't perfect. Not to mention that PLA is cornstarch based, so it is eco friendly and smells nice while printing. The smell is very subtle, though I keep my room well ventilated. PLA isn't as tough as ABS, and may not perform as well in high-stress or high-heat environments, but I haven't found anything to print that needs to be stress-tested. I printed a very thin support for an herbs plant, and the supports were amazingly flexible. For beginners, I'd highly recommend PLA over ABS.  Prints Since this is a PLA printer, it can print at 4 resolutions: low (draft, 0.3mm), standard (0.18mm), high (0.14mm), and hyper (0.08mm). I do the vast majority of my prints in standard, and they come out looking very nice. You can clearly see the print layer, but they're subtle and very uniform. I've also printed at high definition, and at that point the layer lines start to fade. I haven't yet printed in hyper, but the time it takes to print in hyper is unreal, so only save that for when you absolutely need to. The prints usually come out very nice and clean. Sometimes there will be little strings or webs between pieces, but they can quickly be cleaned up with a knife or just your hands. Usually print problems are things I could have fixed, like an overhang that should have had a support but I forgot to add it. The printer has not EVER completely failed a print on it's own. All of the failed prints were either because 1) I forgot to add supports for an overhang greater than 45, 2) there was a raft that fused moving pieces together, or 3) the power went out and canceled the print (consider a UPS battery backup maybe). I haven't had the printer go haywire and screw up a print on it's own yet. It helps that the software it uses is pretty solid and good at detecting problems.  Issues The issues for this have been minor. Once I added the blue painters tape to the print bed, no amount of releveling would get the print head to get the right height. It would drag the print head through the tape, and wouldn't print the first layer of plastic at all. To get it working better, I releveled the bed with an additional piece of paper or two, to get the extra height I need. I've contacted FlashForge about this issue, and I haven't heard back yet. Besides that, the only other issue is the on-printer screen is sometimes a bit janky. While scrolling through my flash drive full of files, it might act like I tapped twice and select something two folders deep. Some people might consider the PLA only or the print bed size problems, but I've managed no problem.  In conclusion, the FlashForge Finder is just about the best printer I could recommend for a beginner or someone looking to get into 3D printing for the best time. It's no the most flexible, it's not very upgradable like a DIY printer, but it's also very stable and very easy to use. PLA plastic is beginner friendly, and I've had wonderful success with it.  PROS: Very affordable Simple to setup and use Minimal tinkering required Accepts 3rd party filaments Removable build plate (easy to put tape down on it) No print failures due to the printer itself so far Nice bundled software On-board 4gb hard drive, to prevent interruption Quite and low-smell  NEUTRALS: PLA only, depends on your goals Build plate size, once again depends on your goals No major upgrades or tinkering potential  CONS: Build plate size can be a bit restricting, depending on your goals On-board slot for PLA spool is proprietary only and only 0.67kg  (side note about photos: I have printed more than just Pokemon, it's just what I had on hand)	-1
I purchased these beakers thinking they were glass. That was my mistake and not the reason I gave the beakers 1 star. I gave these beakers 1 star because the measurements are not accurate! What is the point of having measurements on the container if they're not accurate?  It should state in the description that these are approximate measurements and not to be used for measurement.	-1
These do not use a tb6600 chip.	-1
I would not buy these to do any serious work.  I purchased them to do a few holes in a few panel and control boxes.  All but the largest bit is ruined.  I was really looking forward to these being a reasonable alternative to the ones I buy at my electrical supply house.  I honestly think that the Harbor Freight ones would've held up better.  What I saved in money, I lost in time.	-1
The flange nuts are horrible quality with lots of backlash/loose fit.  The leads themselves are of good quality.	-1
This seemed great on paper, but I was really disappointed in the performance, particularly of the wet vac, which left a ton of slop behind even on little jobs. The dry vac was adequate but not umpressive, below what I'm used to from other shop vacs.  The pros: The tube is very nice and sturdy; and the design, with an on-board storage bucket that holds the attachments, is very handy in theory (though in practice, a bit awkward to move--it's too small and low to the ground to conveniently push, and, though lightweight enough to carry, awkwardly shaped with the long tools in place--they jut out sideways when you lift the unit by the handle--so it's tough to negotiate doorways or narrow jalls without knocking tools loose).  My reference points are a large but cheap 10-yr-old shop vac that's whatever the cheap brand Lowes carries, a wee Dewalt, which has great suction but is too small to be practical in most cases. I was hoping it would replace the Dewalt for smaller jobs (it's not as tiny as the dewalt--and with the added perk of a blower, which might be nice), but no luck. We also have an ancient commercial wet/dry vac that's sloppy but pulls a lot if water in big jobs, so between that and the big shop vac, I only needed it to fill a pretty modest niche.	-1
Ridgid and Shop-Vac just lost a class action suit for fraud June 16, 2016. Lies on HP and capacity did them in. If you bought one of these and kept the receipt you may get back $5000.  That's still in the courts.  But wait- there is more , warranty and a bunch of other stuff. I got my receipt , do you? The lawyers get back up to $4.5 million for their time and effort. Google for details.	-1
I bought this new at big box store. Used it maybe 75 hours - it quit. Then I enquired whether I could buy a replacement motor - was tiold it would cost 240$  !  A thoroughly crappy product and same for company.	-1
This thing is a beast- it was way bigger than expected. If I am going to devote that much of my work space to printer- It needs a way bigger print volume. This just wasn't a fit for my workplace.	-1
the aluminum bed is horrible.  this thing is junk.  a rock found in your side yard is far more valuable.	-1
4 days i tried to get this machine to even print half as good as the 1.0a and failed miserably. Nothing i did helped. i really wished it worked but i sent it back and bought a Robo r1 plus in its place and well the robo is already printing amazingly within hours.	-1
Not a great printer or easy to use. Purchsed to make small items to giveaway at tradeshows. Small items (2inch x 2inch x 3/4inch) on very low speeds were ok, but anything larger forget it! And what no one really tells you is to make one small item is a long time - 45 min for crappy quality and hours for nicer quality. Taller items (2inches tall or more) started getting weak spots between layers even with slow print settings.  Great for prototyping, but not making useable items.  Unboxing/setting up/software install - easy  Calibration - easy  Printing - challenging/frustrating/disappointing  Printing with ABS (included with printer) extruded nicely, but no matter what we did would not stick to print bed  Printing with XYZ PLA filament - stuck to bed, but challenging to get good settings. You have to really play with the settings to see whar works.  Time - takes a long tine to print anything (the actual print is what takes the longest - print a box to hold deck of cards that is ok quality 8 hours!)  I'm a techincal person and very good with tools/trouble shooting, but this was too much for me. And the prints too crappy to feel good about them.  End note: This was a  nice $500 employee team building exercise that lasted a few days!	-1
I am within my 30 days and am returning this item.  XYZ has some great printers out there - this is not one of them!  Mine was poorly constructed (the feed tube will not stay in place) and even though the box was in perfect shape it has not printed anything except the demo projects.  the one project I tried to print has failed every time about 2/3 of the way into a 8 hour build!  Now the XYZ software is shutting down when I try to send a design to the printer.  I am hoping I just have a bad printer and some conflicting software drivers but even after removing the printer and all drivers and software from my pc and reinstalling I cannot get anything to load.  The downside of this is I really enjoy using the XYZ printer at my college lab.  I was really looking forward to the laser engraver addition but now looks like separate 3-d printer and laser engravers.	-1
A friend of mine bought this and at first he was happy with it, he got it on a Tuesday, and told me how amazing this were and that he thinks its a good printer with good quality, I myself is a proud owner of 4 3d printers 3 of them from flashforge (creator pro, Dreamer and Finder) and the forth is M3D Mini and I think very highly of these printers and my favorite is creator pro its a beast, you can check my reviews on these printers. Anyway I decided to try a different brand printer and as my friend told me this was the one, since Tuesday I have not talked to him all I knew he was happy with his purchase, so on Saturday night I ordered this, on Sunday morning told me not to buy this as he didn't got 1 print since he got this printer, so here I am writing a review since its something I enjoy and I believe it helps. as my friend told me and explained his issues: 1. the first issue he ran into is the wires in the printer and under the heated bed, they are not fastened and lose one of the wires were off its location and rubbing on the moving parts he had to put some tapes and bundle them as they are not bundled properly I added some pictures. 2. the sensors on both the top door and the bottom door were bad as it kept giving him a message on the LCD top door is open and he was locked out from the LCD screen while printing. 3. Jog mode was not working properly he had issues moving the Z axes 4. he had leveling bed issues hence not one print would stick to the bed, and that was due to the metal parts in the extruder than has to touch every corner of the bed was not touching the bed for some reason.  I understand this review is what I have witness not what I have experienced but I won't buy this one yet and I would change my review if I had first hand experience if it was better. I hope this helps	-1
Returned item- I had 2(1 replacement and original purchase) have broken components. The first one was the door the second one the whole x axis gear box broke. I have had several xyz printers, this one is poorly constructed. I believe amazon no longer sells this(at the time i returned mine they didn't).	-1
Never buy anything from xyzprinting they will not honor their Warranty if the product is defective and they have zero support if something goes wrong with the product. Worst company ever. Never ever buy anything from them ever. In fact they try to give you free fillment for a good review.  Not all the fillment in the world will make me lie about a bad company.	-1
When it works it prints great parts, x axis belt tensioner was broken, contacted tech support, took a week for them to tell me the part was out of stock.  Takes forever to get the bed leveled with the auto calibration, might only run true for 1-2 prints and be nocked out of alignment when you remove the part, then you are stuck trying to get bed realigned for 45 minutes or longer.  bought because it was available for prime delivery, should have purchased something else.  I would recommend friends to stay away from this printer.	-1
Get your tools out and get ready to fix stuff all the time. I have 3 of these printers, and my boss has one also. we all had to perform the same mod on our machines to get them to reliably feed filament. The hot end on one of mine went out and the fitting that holds the bowden cable broke on another. I am constantly making repairs on these things so just beware. Oh and don't even think about trying to get help from XYZ they are completely useless in terms of support.	-1
Messy, messy.	-1
Bought this at the mall.. GARBAGE	-1
Super Glue even the cheapest is better. I have a tooth on my partial that I have put back on many times with super glue and is works for a long time. I thought if this stuff could glue a boat back together that I would never have to use it a second time. I have followed the directions and even held the blue light on it 10 times longer than the directions say which is 3 seconds. My tooth came off my partial in less time than it took to glue it on all three times I tried it. For me I'll stick with the two dollar super glue since I don't have any boats to glue back together.	-1
Not a smooth slide action as described. Returned.	-1
This thing knows every measurement right away, without any averaging time.  The electronics are great.  But the jaws on the front and back are not thin AT ALL.  The thin area is so thick I can't measure the same groves my old pair will measure.	-1
I noticed that they were very easy to crimp, requiring little force to squeeze the crimp tool - must less than required to crimp other barrel splices.  Then I found that the wires easily pull out of the connector.  Apparently, the barrel is made from some soft metal, perhaps thin aluminum.  I sent them back	-1
Have yet to have these hold a wire. Compared to other crimp connectors the metal appears much thinner.  I tried multiple crimp tools incuding a ratchet type with no success.	-1
Do some research first if you're thinking about buying this printer. The first one I had worked for 4 days before the extrusion motor stopped working. The replacement stopped powering on after a month of use. The poor quality of these printers combined with horrible customer service from M3D make me regret purchasing this printer. Judging by the amount of complaints against M3D at the Better Business Bureau bbb.org, it appears I'm not the only one who feels this way.  This printer is guaranteed to break on you at some point and will require you to contact M3D. M3D customer support is impossible to contact and generally useless once you do get a reply. They will give you the runaround and ask you to perform pointless troubleshooting on the printer while taking 2-3 days to respond to any messages you might send. After troubleshooting via email inevitably fails, they will ask you to submit an RMA request. Their RMA process is a joke. They will charge you to send in your defective printer and initially promise to send a replacement within 2 days of receiving your defective printer. I've filed two RMAs with M3D and after constant follow-up on my end, the first replacement took 23 days to ship and the second replacement took 29 days to ship.  There are way better printers with much better customer support available for the same price as the M3D Micro. I would recommend staying far, far away from M3D.	-1
I ordered the brown filament.....what I received was not brown. Maybe a terracotta or maybe some weird shade of rust or maybe even clay, but definitely not brown. Printed a Baby Groot....he looks like he got a sunburn. Print quality is OK, but nothing that makes me say "Wow!"  It does have some consistency issues. I measured a few different spots while printing with my calipers and it's definitely not consistent. This led to some issues while printing - gaps and weird looking spots.  I only tried this filament because most of Amazon was sold out of brown 1.75 PLA. I don't think I will be purchasing this filament again, it just has too many issues that affect my prints.	-1
So unlike many of the comments on here, I do print a LOT (4 rolls a week). Initially i thought this was a hatchbox re seller, which was what i was looking for. But after printing the filament for roughly 12 hours I can confidently say this is not. Here are the issues I have experienced with this filament. 1. I have had 2 clogs so far. It seems that the diameter is not very consistent, or perhaps it was sitting in a warehouse for an extended period of time. 2. It doesn't flow consistently. Parts came out looking faded and some sections were obviously under extruded. 3. It requires a lot more heat than other brands I use (Hatchbox, Gizmodorks, Esun...). I have to print this at 205C+ (while the rest are amazing at 195) for it to flow well, leading me to believe it is not very pure or something.  Overall, I don't recommenced anyone who relies on their printer to purchase this filament. It just isn't consistent enough and frankly is just inferior to everything else I have tried. A better and cheaper alternative, which I have purchased tens of rolls and never had a problem is Hatchbox. In full disclosure this is based off one roll, so it is possible that mine was a Dud. If the manufacturer wants to send me another roll I will test it and correct this review I did in fact receive a bad roll.	-1
Not very good filament at all. Wound too tightly in some spots extruder cannot pull the filament causes print to fail. Also the filament was wrapped under itself at least twice. Caused two failed prints. Melt is not very good either all parts have been very globby. Stay away from this filament. I normally use Microcenter inland filament and it is cheaper and so much better.	-1
3d4use white plastic filament extrudes evenly. The first day I printed a couple items and they worked acceptably ( not super great). After the first day I've had less luck. Anything tall pulls off the bed part way through, unless i used blue tape, and did not heat the bed.	-1
At the beginning of the roll, this filament printed beautifully. But after a few prints, the width of the filament changed drastically. Going from 1.75 to 1.95. I have attached photos of the white 3D4Use filament, next to grey Monoprice filament so you can see the difference. I have also attached a photo of the filament as measured by my digital caliper.	-1
Bought this because they were out of Hatchbox. Bought 2 rolls of white because of the great reviews.  Mistake.  Ran through my Hatchbox white (about a roll a week) and immediately inserted and calibrated this.  3+ ROLLS of Hatchbox in February without a single failure.  This stuff? Very first small print job (printing 32mm ball-bearing hubs for this filament) and the job failed. Not a spooling issue. Clogged print head. Haven't had one of those in about 6 rolls of filament. Cleared, bumped the temp up to 205 and tried again.  Failed again.  Clogged. Cleared it, pulled out some Hatchbox and printed the 2 hubs. Perfect.  No problems at all.  Switched back to this stuff, inserted newly printed hubs (with ball bearings) and tried to print another set.  Failed.  5 failed jobs out of 6 attempts and the one job that did complete was unusable because filament didn't flow consistently.  I've had this filament for about a month but it was stored in the vacuum sealed factory bag inside another vacuum-pack Ziplock bag with about 6 2-ounce bags of Silica Gel inside a sealed storage box with 20 other rolls of vacuum-packed filament. (I know about moisture...) Of course, my return options for the one unused, still sealed roll expired yesterday.  If you are inclined to buy this filament, it is slightly more yellow than the Hatchbox white, much more yellow than the Argos white but not quite as yellow as the Solutech Real White.  (I really wish everyone would use Pantone or web colors to define color...)  I hate bashing filament companies, but I can't recommend this.	-1
This stuff does not flow straight out of my 0.4mm nozzle, like other PLAs.  It comes out squirming sideways, and then sticks all over the nozzle instead of the base plate.  I haven't gotten a single successful print from it yet.  Sometimes it just creates a giant ball of goo on the nozzle.	-1
magnet not strong enough to spin stir bar. waste of money	-1

This product is junk.  I dos not work on many items.	-1
Spend more money and get a quality set! Don't waste your money here	-1
Great customer service as we did submit for a return. BP cuff only kind of worked but the stethoscope did not work at all. Smooth transactions overall.	-1
This item was purchased as a gift for me.  It has a 30 day manufacturer's warranty and Amazon's return policy expired in Nov of '12.  It is the #105 steth, but even though it is a budget model, it should still function properly.  Taps on the diaphragm are about the only thing you can hear.  I gave it one star because the sphygmomanometer works very well.	-1
~7 hour print ruined by tangles and stuck to itself in the spool. Tangle was so tight, my extruder pulled the spool & holder forward to fall over! Feel lucky my printer was not damaged. See attached photos.  Stay away from this stuff!!  Was going to return; but, have just missed the return date. I will have to re-spool this roll to use it & baby sit it for every print. I didn't have to do this with that "H" brand that is out there, get what you pay for.	-1
The packaging was great.  The roll it's on is very nice.  The filament seems to be consistent.  It looks pretty nice when printed well. Good matte finish.  But the layer adhesion is horrible.  I was hoping that being a variant of ABS it would be usable for functional parts and not just to look pretty.  Unfortunately I had to throw away most of the parts I made for the intended project because they would break very easily.  I know layer adhesion can be a factor of temperature, cooling rate, and environment temp.  I have an enclosed print area.  I have a heated bed.  And I tried temps ranging from 10 degrees under the recommended spec to 10 degrees over.  It actually performed best on the low end, which was surprising. I used it right out of the vacuum sealed packaging that had a bunch of desiccant in it.  My theory is that whatever they blended the ABS with is decomposing in the melt process.  At the higher temps it just peels apart layer by layer.  At lower temps it's a little harder to get it to separate, but not hard enough.  All of the PLA I've ever used has been more functional than this.  Most of the ABS has also been better. (though I have tried some real junk that was not worth the incredible hassle it caused)  So far, the Hatchbox ABS and a local company called Coex have given me the best results with ABS.  The Coex natural ABS plus is incredibly strong.  But I don't know if the black is.  Often the Black has a lot of carbon or other additive to get the color.  That can degrade strength a lot.  Might be the case with this one too.  If you want something black that prints well for looks, this might do ok.  Just use lower temps like 220c.  If you want structural strength, look elsewhere.	-1
I love eSun ABS but the Silver ABS+ is the worst filament I've ever used. Stringy, doesn't adhere.  It's terrible. The ABS+ Black, Grey, White, all amazing, the Silver+ is garbage.	-1
I've purchased Esun filament many times maybe 10 to 15 different schools but with this filament it's extremely brittle soft horrible layer bonding have tried many different types of prints  and cannot get a successful print I own three different printers and all three struggle with this filament	-1
"Can" work but very sensitive to warping.  Small parts often break like clay.	-1
Can't use . product requires Intel i5 or higher, which was not stated in the listing. Its a boat anchor for me.	-1
Well i don't have the right 3d printer and it doesnt work with amd processors. Big waste of money	-1
Never buy anything from xyzprinting they will not honor their Warranty if the product is defective and they have zero support if something goes wrong with the product. Worst company ever. Never ever buy anything from them ever.	-1
I have nearly 20 years experience with 3d software and 3d printing, in that time i have also had some opportunities to work with 3d scanners. Most of the machines i have had the opportunity to use have been less than $3k this one being the cheapest.  I have never had great results with any of these scanners and the machines that i have seen that do produce great results cost much more so i think i had reasonable expectations. My mindset was definitely that for only $200 there wasn't much to risk.  Turns out the risk was exactly that, I spent $200 and now have a useless, poorly designed thing to show for it.  The scanner is designed to be held horizontally in your left hand for scanning, you might think "why can't i just put it in my right hand?" or "why can't i hold it vertically since the button placement, logo printing and all online product images would make it appear so intuitive to do so." the answer is because the up/down calibration is locked and only works in the left hand horizontal position. I guess you could hold it in your right hand but unfortunately there is a thumb button required to start and stop your scan and if you hold it in your right hand, you cant operate that button. If like me you are predominantly right handed, this makes for a very clumsy scan operation on a device that seems to require absolute precision to produce modestly usable data.  the software flat out doesn't work, sometimes it won't start, sometimes it crashes most of the time it will partially scan an object and lose calibration.  So far the only usable data i was able to get from this device was by taking 5 partially failed scans and recombining them in a separate 3d modeling software.	-1
Setup was easy. Included with the printer is a color step by step guide and all the tools you will need to work on, and with, your printer. There are only 6 screws in the assembly: 4 to connect the upper and lower chassis and 2 for the spindle holder.  The final assembly step is connecting 4 cables. The connections are keyed so you can't possibly connect the cables wrong.  Also included is a sample print that was actually printed on my printer. In my case it was a butterfly. The quality of the print was exquisite.  This is where my positive experience ends. I ran into 2 issues: 1 minor and 1 major. During setup I had issues leveling the bed. There simply wasn't enough play in the front right screw to level that corner. I had to tweak the frame slightly to keep the nozzle from touching the bed. Next I moved on to the warm up step. The bed quickly came up to temp but the extruder did not. I checked the wires from the heater core back to the controller box. No obvious breaks and the board connection was firmly seated.  I emailed Monoprice tech support, 8 days later I received an automated email from Monoprice asking how they did with assisting with my request. I responded that I didn't receive any assistance (in fact I had already acquired an RMA to return the defective unit). Monoprice's response was to ask if I was printing with the files included on the SD card. Which is entirely unhelpful becuase you can't print AT ALL with a cold extruder.  I don't think Monoprice has the infrastructure setup to support these printers yet. Be wary, you are on your own. Monoprice doesn't even have user forums to fall back to.	-1
This printer ended up seizing up everytime I started it. The fans in the back of the power supply just got jammed up and stopped working. After about 2 weeks of use, this thing became a $300 electrical hazard. This is not to mention every single print I did on this machine came out frayed (even though I'm experienced in using 3D printers). I thought I could get some utility out of this as a small machine for hobby prints, but this is going right into the trash. Won't even bother returning, way too much of a hassle.	-1
received  damaged unusable	-1
The first 6 prints or so were excellent, I thought I had a winner.  Had to return it.  Bed would not level so the first layer would sick.  Back right corner just like all for forums say.  Spent many hours trying to get it to work.	-1
Significant work needed to get a decent print. I had to completely rebuild this printer and use squares, calipers, and other precision instruments to get a decent looking print. The monoprice select mini still prints better out the box even after all that effort. Update My printer is now stuck in a configuration that only allows positive servo movement while homing. I'm great with electronics and am at my end with this thing. Customer service is nonexistent (knew that before I bought) and  scouring forums has been unfruitful. It's probably going to be mothballed and turned into some sort of frankinprinter down the road.	-1
Well after 50 hours of printing just like everyone else the bed shudders really bad. Everyone says its the bearings. Why does amazon sell such garbage from these people.	-1
This is the bar none worst out of the box printer I have ever used It's cheap but there's a reason it's cheap Leveling can be incredibly difficult my build plate was warped and the printer was so far out of whack it took me an entire day of printing test prints to get it right I will be returning this item extremely disappointed	-1
For the price, the machine itself isn't terrible. I've seen a lot of pretty good prints made on this model (A small handful of them were mine). of course, because the price is so low, you'll need to print out an assortment of minor upgrades to bring it up to spec. It requires a good deal of tinkering to get everything running well. I consider that reasonable for the price.  The real problem lies in their customer support. Three months into its career my machine broke down due to some issue in the control unit. Basically only the fans worked. So I contacted Monoprice customer support. They didn't want to walk me through a repair so I had to pull out all my upgrades and take it in for a replacement. Not ideal, but okay. So I get the replacement in, reinstall all my upgrades and get it fine-tuned again. Just under three months into the life of the replacement, it dies. Exact same symptoms. I contact customer support again. When they eventually get back to me, they want me to send it in again. They can't offer any sort of guarantee that I won't be sending that one back in another three months and absolutely refuse to troubleshoot with me. So, after many emails back and forth, it was made clear to me that, at the end of my 1 year warranty, I'd be the proud owner of a fourth broken printer and they would still refuse to help me fix it.  At this point, I've given up any expectation of getting a reliable machine from Monoprice.  So, I would only recommend this printer to someone who is really good with electronics and has the confidence to safely repair it themselves when it inevitably burns out and customer support leaves them high and dry.  If I could make a recommendation to Monoprice, it would be that they train their factory workers/technicians to some degree or another.  Or to use reliable components.	-1
Nothing but problems.  Unfortunately the problems don't show up till a few months of use.  Monoprice's support and replacement warranty is second to none however that doesn't do me any good.  I'm on my 3rd printer and now after another 6 months the print bed started to warp making leveling nearly impossible.	-1
**UPDATE**  after having 14days of print time, it continuously resets itself on every print.  Will NOT complete a single print more than 5%.  I have been trying to contact monoprice customer service for over a week, with no responses...  Im getting very disappointed with this company.  Upon researching further, this is a common problem with their main board.  Any help would be greatly appreciated, especially if the company actually reads and/or cares about customer satisfaction. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  As a Novice in the hobby, I find the controls very easy to use.  The learning curve is on the software, but thats to be expected with any new program you aren't use to.  LEVEL YOUR BED AND EXTRUDER or "You're Not gonna have a good time"	-1
UPDATE: This printer's advertising is a lie. They state that it can print ABS right out of the box - it can if you don't mind risking burning your house down. The board inside the control box is not wired properly and does not used connectors rated for the power required to print ABS filament. These connectors will melt under the strain of ABS causing it to smoke and eventually catch fire. There is a fix for this issue but why is Monoprice allowed to sell these printers knowing about a faulty electrical connection??!! These printers should all be recalled due to this VERY dangerous design flaw!!!!!!!  I purchased this printer about a month ago. I have been using it on almost a daily basis and it does a decent job for what little it costs compared to other printers.  One major flaw I found ion this printer is its print size. The listing claims that it has a 7 inch (177.8 mm) vertical printing capability. It does not. I attempted to print an object that was just over 6 inches tall, 154 mm to be exact, and the top of the printer's extruder hits the underside of the top of the frame not allowing it to go any further and risks damaging the printer. Basically anything over about 150 mm is not printable because of this error.  The only other problem I found that bugs me is the print bed leveling. The system used to level the bed is faulty - the springs do not stay straight which allows the level of the bed to drift requiring it to be releveled constantly. There are modifications out there that can be printed to fix this but you shouldn't have to fix something like this yourself when the manufacturer obviously just did a faulty job.  Other than these two issues it actually is a decent printer. I've printed basic objects and complex objects with both PLA and PET-G and it has done well with both. I upgraded to a glass print bed (prints much nicer with it) and I printed out a new cooler fan system which allows for better printing.  If you're looking for a good entry level printer for a good value that you don't mind tinkering with and making some modification to then this printer is for you. If you're looking for a printer that doesn't require the level of maintenance this printer requires then you should spend a little more for a better printer without the issues as listed here.  UPDATE: Since owning this printer since December, I have had to replace both fans on the extruder and both the fans in the power supply. All of them are cheap fans that the ball bearings are poorly made and starting making horrible noises. I was told by the Monoprice rep when I called about the warranty that I would need to ship the printer back but at my expense. I'm sorry, but I will not spend that much money to ship this item at my expense when I can fix the fans for under $30 with good fans.	-1
Printer itself is good however has some issues and mine came with broken navigate button but print quality is pretty good for the price edit: after 2 weeks of use printer started to restart in the middle of print and i have some burning smells comes out from the unit. there are many coments about this and i am one of them, think twice before you buy it now i have tons of fillaments and non working printer.. DO NOT BUY IT not worth just for 2 weeks 2nd edit: monoprice sent me one new mainboard. i'd install it and works good however this time that burning smell comes from printer itself i cannot find from where exacly could be extruder or motors but all my prints fails after like 40th layer and end up with balls of plastics. i'd try it with 4 different brand of PLA and 2 ABS and end up same not even 1 successfull print. whoever reads this comment i repeat STAY AWAY from this printer im really frustrated with that purchase i would give -5 star if i could	-1
I owned it for 2 days before it began to reboot the control box mid-print. Then it got worse and wouldn't finish preheating before it rebooted. Not a good start for a new device. Amazon was excellent and issued me a refund when I returned the faulty printer. I should have listened to some of the other warnings of people having boards "fry" or "smoke" or "fail". I think they have faulty power supplies which is why I didn't just opt for a replacement. The few prints it did day 1 did fine.	-1
Where do I start with this printer.  First off I do own another Monoprice product (MP Mini Select) and understand some of the cheap part and build quality issues they have.  I worked through those issues and corrected them on my MP Mini and now it is my favorite go to printer, so I was excited to buy another one on which I could do some of the bigger builds I have envisioned and decided to give Monoprice a shot (since I was very familiar with there issues), boy was I wrong.  To start with this is a Wannao I3 clone, so I at least knew I could find replacement parts and a large on line community dedicated to these printers for technical advise and help working through there issues when they arise.  Right out of the box I was impressed with: The build quality- good heavy, easy to assemble frame How large the print bed was thumb screws to level the print bed..no more tiny allen wrenches size of stepper motors All the adjustments that could be made through the control box and how easy it was to scroll through the options on the menu. How impressive the machine looked once it was assembled Ease of assembly.  Unfortunately there is where it ends!!!  I spent a lot of time leveling the machine...making sure it was perfect.  Leveling the build plate, per there instructions and my own experience.  Once done I started one of the SD cards test prints and right out of the box had a problem.  The limit switches were not aligned properly which caused the belts to grind and pop....ok my fault should have checked them..but the machined went to home position with out issue so I didn't think to do it.  Got the test print started, after realigning things (with help from the on line community) and everything seemed to be going ok...BUT I noticed the quality of the print was poor at best.  Stopped machine, made sure my temps were correct for the material (both bed and extruder), made sure there were no clogs in the nozzle, made sure feeder was operating properly.  Re leveled the bed and checked the machine...everything was correct with no issues.  Started test print again (butterfly) once again 3/4 of the way through print quality went to crap....stopped print...went to bed (to frustrated at this point).  Another thing with this machine I noticed was all the NOISE it made when printing, the fans (especially on the control box) and how fast it moved from position to position causing alot of vibration and shaking in the machine (somewhat solved the issue by slowing down the print speed to 50-60...but still real bad), the stepper motors were also real loud...you definitely know when this machine is printing.  So Slowed it down..made sure everything was correct.  Changed out the nozzle for a better one over stock.  Changed out feeder tension arm for a cast one.  Re leveled bed, with a mic, (was still correct).  And hit print...as you already guessed, It eventually finished it, but I could have gotten better quality by using a hand held extruder and one eye closed.  Dang!!!!!!!......Had Lunch (wish I still drank)  Spent the next week every night trying to get this printer to work..I know you would say e-mail Monoprice customer support...Been down that road before, and got better advise from my 8 month old grand daughter (had to figure out the MP Mini problems with help of on line forums and printing my own replacement parts for that printer) than I ever got from Monoprice.  I never could get this printer to ever print one decent quality job...out of 10+ tries they were all failures ranging from bed adhesion issues, wildly fluctuating heat issues, poor print adhesion, vibration, etc..etc etc.  In the end I had to give up.  I boxed it back up and sent it back for a refund, didn't want a replacement as I have had enough of this brand name and this particular printer.  Maybe mine was just a lemon..I don't know.  I hope others have had positive experiences with there printers (according to the ratings others have), but this one left a bad taste in my mouth.  Now on the hunt for a better quality printer, with a large build area...so I can continue this 3D printing hobby of mine.  Good Luck with yours and if you do decide to purchase one, I hope you have a better experience than I did.	-1
I'll admit I'm a Newby to 3d printing, I'm also a pretty crafty technical engineering type of person as well.  I found this printer to basically be just like the majority of the reviews said, it's great price, decent quality, and can produce some pretty good prints with patience, research, and lots of online video how to setup.  the manual bed leveling is probably the single most frustrating process, but once you get that figured out its pretty good. I bumped it down one star because I concur with some other reviews that customer service sucks.  I contacted monoprice customer service about the scraper being bad, out of the box it was dented up on the end and unusable, not a huge deal as they are cheap and have nothing to do with the printer actually being able to print, however the response from monoprice was that I could get another at the hardware store....I mean would it kill them if they sent a $2 replacement scaper, probably not. Anyway I'll update later after more use  ****Update 7/2/17 well I've made a lot of prints over the last 11 months but it now starting smoking out the control box and doesn't print anymore.  a little on line research and many many others have seen same issue, I'll be calling monoprice to see how they handle this issue, hopefully better response than with the scraper issue when I first got it.  bumping down to 2 stars until I hear back from monoprice.	-1
This printer works ok for smaller objects, but the moment you try to print anything bigger than 20x20mm, it will have problems.  Leveling the bed is a giant pain in the butt because of the wing nuts. I spent more time trying to get this to print than actually printing. Save yourself a headache and go with something a little more pricer. I ended up buying an Ultimaker 2+ and, although more than 6 times the cost, is 600x the quality. Prints that were actually successful at a certain resolution compared to prints on my Ultimaker at the same resolution were of no comparison.	-1
kind of weak for my use.	-1
Dead on arrival. Dont waste your time and money	-1
I was not very happy with this product. I recalibrated it twice because it kept jumping around on the ph. It will tell me what my ph is around but not very precisely. If you need a very precise reading then you should spend more money.	-1
When this pH meter arrived, it wouldn't calibrate. I contacted the seller and they sent me another one. This one worked for about 2 weeks and it stopped calibrating. By this I mean: I calibrated the tester using the calibration solutions that came with it. After calibrating, it wouldn't give the same reading twice in a row. I checked the calibration and it was off by more than 1.0, so I calibrated again. I got the same results from checking and re-calibrating. I performed a calibration one more time. Again, constant fluctuation! I threw it away and bought another lucky stone (cheap, no back lighting, no automatic off, calibrate with a screwdriver) one. If I didn't check the calibration once a week, I may have started killing my fishes and not understood why...	-1
Difficult to calibrate. Directions clearly aren't written by a native english speaker. I finally was able to get it to read 6.86, but seriously doubt the accuracy. Buy a better unit!	-1
Has absorbed moisture just in little time it was open.  Prints are all mess due to filament not coming out uniformly.  I hear lots of water pops during print.  Everywhere it pops, leaves blank during print and then I can see big blog coming out followed by more popping sounds.	-1
I experienced inconsistent results and occasional head clogs which ended up wasting almost 1/3 of the reel.  Disappointed, will try another brand.	-1
Pure crap. Almost destroyed printer.	-1
this thing clogs my MP Select Mini 0.4 nozzle every single time I try to use it.  I have to go through a whole ritual to unclog it.  once unclogged, printing with a regular PLA everything prints out perfectly fine, leading me to believe it's this filament that's causing me grief.  if it wasn't such a pain in the butt to return it, I really would.  very disappointing.  update: tried this on Prusa MK3 as well but no improvement.  it actually formed a knot after entering the extruder body and forced me to take the entire assembly apart just to clean out that knot. I've had 1/2 spool left but threw it out because it was just taking up room.  oh and it stinks too while it prints.  all around bad filament.  stay away	-1
Very cool Filament Works great for model fences on train layout	-1
Of course, as soon as I got this, I tried the Groot bust. It came out nicely - I ran it at 212c and everything went well. I took away a star from what would have been a 5 star review because of the spool - the inside diameter is too small to fit on my Printrbot Simple Metal spool holder and I had to rig something with the handle and a clamp. Otherwise, fine stuff. No clogs yet :)  Edit: OMG strings! For Groot, it worked fine but as soon as I started printing something with supports (by Meshmixer) STRINGS! I've dropped the temp back down to 207, but it's still starting its own cat's cradle. The photo isn't a failed print, it's the strings from this filament! At this point I would not recommend this. Hopefully I'll find the right settings and it won't be a complete loss.  Final edit: Nope, I'm just not up to experimenting with this stuff. I have things to make, and if they can't give settings for their specialty filament, I'll have to use other that works right without hours of tweaking. Returning the filament and getting another.	-1
seems to not want to stay in the vice jaws, walks out more often than not.  Not sure why, guess it is not centered right.	-1
These are horrible--they are made of a hard plastic and the magnets are very, very weak. They are also made such that when they are sitting against the face of the vise jaws, the bottom of them is gapped such that they pivot forward very easily, and the weak ass magnets don't hold them in position to let you get them closed, the rock out of square and often one or the other simply falls out of the vise. Awful!!	-1
The glue on the roll I got won't hardly stick to anything.	-1
Not like any gaffer's tape I've ever used. Very thin, does not tear cleanly or straight, leaves white exposed edge of adhesive along the tear. It has fibers in it, but they're very loose, almost like that fiber packing tape, only much thinner.	-1
Awful gaffer's tape. Very thin and not very sticky compared to the previous brand I bought on Amazon. I got this because it was cheaper and got what I paid for.

head is smaller than GRK, loved the idea of stainless because we live on the gulf,  but 50% of them twisted off.  even with predrilled holes and turning down the torque	-1
The heads on these screws make it impossible to drive even into soft pine.  I can not use a single one without it stripping the head.  the good news is that the stripping usually comes early in the screwing process so you can still remove them and use another screw - not from this batch.  This seems to be a systemic problem with stainless screws but these are the worst I have used.	-1
Didnt work	-1
leaks badly just holding back about 11 inches of standing water with nothing but atmospheric pressure. The green "coral growth" on it makes me think the leak started as corrosion and allowed water to seep. It did not leak at first but within a couple of months of use it is now not usable.	-1
Used to control the flow of water to cool the outside of a beer fermenter. I should have know there would be a problem when I touched the solenoid and it was hot although 40F water was flowing through it	-1
Bought 3 of these for a home aquaponics project. Just now putting them in and it looks like 1 out of the 3 never fully closes... I do have them installed in a horizontal position like the instructions dictate and it looks like it's leaking less and less as the valve open and closes so it might fix itself over time. #Update# The valve that never fully closes still is leaking + others now. Also when open they have very little flow, close to how much they leak when they are open so they are pretty much useless.. also these things could probably catch something on fire when activated. Definitely too hot to touch. going to cut my losses and get a ball valve	-1
I bought these to make essential oil sprays.  I've used three so far and all of them the plunger gets stuck and you have to manually pull it up to continue spraying; very annoying.  The bottles themselves seem fine and I haven't tried plain water or anything, but why would you need 12 bottles of water anyway.  If you can't spray something else they are worthless.	-1
Printer seemed to work okay, I had a few minor issues. Customer service was lacking when I had a few minor problems so I returned the item. I would spent the extra money to get something better.	-1
returned product as it did not functions as described/desired.	-1
Update: Due to cheap connectors on the board, I have almost had a fire on my hands twice. The first time was the main power connector where the power supply feeds the control board. Smelled burning electronics and found the terminal connectors charred black and smoking. I was able to turn off power before it was too much of a problem and replace the connector with a higher quality one. In hind sight I probably should have replaced them all because today the same thing happened only with the connector to the heated bed. I fully understand trying to keep costs down, but these should really be higher quality connectors. The printer was only running at 205c on the nozzle and 60c on the beds both times this has happened. For this I am further reducing my rating to 1 star. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for an affordable printer.  Original: And buy a better version of the i3. I own the Migbot Prusa i3 and it works phenominally once you put in the time to calibrate it and straighten out minor hardware problems.  I bought this one as a secondary so I can print more but so far ive had nothing but problems.  Problems: 1. Nozzle has a hard time reaching its target temp, and sometimes never will reach it. I assume that this is a problem with the PID or the thermistor.  The thermistor does not have any kind of set screw in the heat block, meaning it kind of just sits freely in a hole so it is not getting proper contact and could therefore be causing my issues.  Additionally, I can not find Alunar's firmware online to modify the PID settings and I do not want to build a version of Marlin from scratch. 2. The Z axis limit switch has a lot of play (2-3 mm).  What I mean is that sometimes when the carriage homes the switch does not activate until it is fully pressed, however, other times the switch activates at about 50% press which is a couple mm difference and has so far made calibrating the bed height nearly impossible. This may be solved with a new limit switch but I think I will be taking the plunge and adding an inductive proximity sensor to replace the limit switch. 3. The firmware/lcd combo is horrible. It is clunky, hard to navigate, and painfully laggy.  In addition when trying to select a file to print, it scrolls long file names, which wouldn't be bad, except it also scrolls the cursor off the screen so you cant tell what file you are printing. I know it seems like I'm nitpicking at this point, but after using it a few times you will be grinding your teeth in frustration. 4. Although so far it hasn't been a crippling issue, the 3d printed parts for the carriage were poorly printed (probably printed using a stock version of this). 5. The stepper belts are not like the ones you normally would buy, these are made of a stiffer rubber which makes them hard to tension correctly and makes them prone to skipping when the carriages are near their limits.  Overall, most of the hardware on this printer is fine. I will note that it runs much quieter than its migbot counterpart; however, sound doesn't make much of a difference if the printer doesn't work. Ultimately, I am confident I can get this printer running well after i buy a proximity sensor, some new GT2 belt, and a new heater block. Plus, I will probably end up customizing a version of Marlin for it, although I am apprehensive to do so as I have said I cannot find the stock firmware to go back to if something goes wrong.  Just do yourself a favor and spend an extra 50 bucks or so on a better kit, otherwise you will pay back that 50 bucks in new parts and headaches. Especially if you are new to 3d printers, as I would not have any clue where to start fixing this thing if I didn't have the experience I gained from my other printer.	-1
Did not include SD card and reader. Z-axis guides do not line up with Z-axes threaded rods. Heated bed produces hot spots. Extruder spring is way to tight. Does not have a power switch. LCD and user interface is laggy and unresponsive. Power supply does not fit properly into the mounting holes. Instructions are nearly non-existent. Controller board can not accept additional extruder. Belts have no tensioner spring. Included PLA filament is bottom of the barrel crap. Does not list specs, firmware, schematics or any other type of information.  The only real 'pro' to the entire review and machine is that it works and I can use it to build a quality printer.	-1
The parts I received do not match the videos you follow to build the kit.  For example, the H-plate that slides along the Y axis is acrylic in the video.  I received 3 metal plates screwed together with screws, some of which were stripped when I received the kit.  The metal isn't nearly as thick as the acrylic, so I'm having to guess which screws to use to attach it.  Some of the longitudinal bearings that slide along the various shafts were loose and/or the tiny bearings would fall out as you insert the ends of the shaft.  I'm not even half way done building the kit, and already 6 of the small acrylic pieces have cracked just from moving the printer around.  I've made replacements from wood, and hopefully I will be able to print real replacement parts once the kits it assembled.  The front and back acrylic plates of the printer are bowing just from the little tension of the y-axis belt.  I would recommend getting some other version of this kit with more metal and less brittle acrylic pieces.	-1
Excellent product, packaging, and shipping.  There are no defects in any of the bottles or droppers, and I really like that they were in separate packages so the rubber on the syringes don't degrade as fast.  Edit:  I put oils in some of the bottles, and just a couple of days later all of the syringes had degraded and the oils were black from the rubber pieces.  I'm not sure what you can use these for since they're not safe to put anything in you plan to ingest, and anything else will be ruined by the rubber.  I'm out $80 and extremely angry at the lack of QC.  The picture provided shows the rubber from the dropper stuck to the bottle.	-1
This does a lot of what it says it will do but for what I've tried it on it just won't stick it will dry but it peels loose with very little effort	-1
They look good. But you can't insert small parts (resistors, diodes, led's, capacitors etc.) without bending the leads. The holes are to tight. I've had to force a jumper wire into each hole before inserting a smaller part. i can get them to work but it's a lot of trouble. I wouldn't recommend these.	-1
let them know if there's any missing resistors	-1
The kit came with everything as advertised. It refused to power up beyond the screen turning on. The LED trigger light, according to the instructions, should have also come up but did not. I triple-checked all of my solder joints and did testing with a multimeter. The voltage would surrepititiously drop off right after getting out of the power supply area. Upon closer inspection, it looks like the SMD components may have a fault in them from the manufacturing process.  Hours and hours of frustration spent on this thing. The instructions were acceptable, but I think could have benefited from a more verbose troubleshooting section, possibly on its own. I wasted my money on this, don't waste yours.	-1
Quite surprisingly, the kit contained the exact inventory of parts needed to build the scope.  Assembled with no problem.  The display did light, but would not perform beyond that.  I checked all the voltage test points and all voltages checked out OK.  I wound up filing it in the garbage.	-1
no instructions which screw is intended for where, the spring seems a little short like it doesn't belong or something.	-1
Im in the didn't receive what is pictured camp. Although they don't have nearly as nice a finish to them, nor do they have any chamfering at the hub edges, they run true and the bores are centered.  Compared to nice shiny pulleys that wobble around, I suppose these are the better value.  I just wish it wasn't so difficult to find high-quality 16T pulleys...	-1
Not polished, not engraved, chipped teeth, bent teeth, crushed bulged extrusion. Honestly what I got is garbage. I should have returned them but didn't want to be bothered. Certainly not as advertised.  Hopefully others get what they paid for.  Ohh and they chew up belts like a paper shredder.	-1
One other reviewer commented about the insertion of the tools, and not being able to take them back out. I think that this is because the instructions tell you to back out the screws and then snug after putting the one piece in. I didn't find that backing out the screws was necessary at all. And frankly, if I did do that, it would have been a problem, which is one of the flaws of this vacuum.  The vacuum where it transitions from the wand to the hose, in one cleaning of my wood stove insert, clogged there twice. I had to remove the hose from the base unit, remove the tools and empty the clogs out.  One other major shortcoming is the hose length. At three feet, I have to hold the vacuum in one hand and move the hose around with the other. It's a proprietary hose unlock many shop vacs so you cannot buy something aftermarket. Perhaps they sell a longer hose.  With the negatives out of the way, I will say it's such an environmental improvement vacuuming the ash out instead of the shovel/bucket method which fills the air with dust. This combined with now burning eco-bricks, I've made a significant reduction in household dust.  The label of ash vac is somewhat misleading as applied to this unit. It's more of a shop-vac with a fine particulate hepa style filter. Instructions say to use on cool ashes, they don't mention the 122 degrees as listed here on the site. Other ash vacuums are rated over 1,000 degrees. Those vacuums are double the price, but if you start a fire once and burn all season...  <update> I moved this down to one star. This isn't worth much. I've now found that for a normal ash load in my stove, I need to take the thing apart, three to four times to unclog the hose. Where the hose goes into the collection chamber, it makes a 45 degree bend, this clogs readily, then backs the hose up.  The head where you put the attachments, is stripped out and no longer latches.  Only nice thing is that it isn't as loud as a typical shop vac.	-1
I like the magnets for when I am working with metal stud walls and that it stays out until you press the release. Unfortunately, the tape buckles more easily than some others and I would rather not have the metric markings on one side. The return spring could also be stronger.  UPDATE: is supposed to stay open until you press the button. No longer does so. As a result it won't stay open and is always trying to retract. This after a year of limited use.	-1
VERY slow response (screen update) time, when checking continuity, don't lift test lead too quickly... count up to two or three then check or listen for reading. Meter rated as 6000 count, mine acts more like 500-1000 count... Very annoying. Not happy.	-1
The filament was visibly tangled and kinked on the spool when I received it. My review is based solely upon that at this point. I'm attempting to print with it now, but I have very little hope as im sure the tangles will cause the filament to break or pull out of the extruder during the print. I will never buy this again and id advise not to take the chance on it.	-1
This is a repurchase and they must have changed the formula because the color is different. It's more of a dull brown/green than bronze, and does NOT have a  look metallic at all. Also, unlike Colorfabb and eSun bronze filaments, this brand has no actual metal content.  The last time I purchased this, it had a very accurate bronze color. Not this time. The photo still shows how it looked as the bronze metallic material. This is a bait and switch! I won't be purchasing it again after this experience.  I can recommend their metallic silver however.	-1
Prints fairly well but its rather expensive considering its only a 0.5 kg roll and the color is NOT bronze, not even close...	-1
I keep hoping to find a bronze filament that's bronze, and this one isn't it. At best it's a yellow ochre color - no metallic properties and certainly no actual bronze. Disappointing. May be good for a poop emoji though.  And after the poop emoji it made a nice loofah sponge out of what should have been a sculpture with 20% fill. Unfortunately iy decided that clogging the nozzle was more fun, so is getting returned to Amazon innediately. Crap filament.	-1
After 2 days wasted trying numerous modifications, this upgrade will not work. Doesn't allow pinda probe to reach front row of sensors. Thanks for nothing and wasted time.	-1
Makes my tongue burn...I must have allergies to some of the ingredients as my tongue has some serious burning after using and continues to burn most of the day.  I have tried it a few times doesn't work for me.	-1
First off this stuff is junk, does not come on a roll, is nasty (as others have said) and above all else the OD on my 32' was 4.15. Needless to say this would not work on my 3D printers without sanding the exterior of the tube down some. Please save yourself the headache and don't end up with 32' feet of the worlds smallest water hose.	-1
not the best quality keep searching	-1
The one I received did not work properly.  First off, the case is not assembled. This would not be an issue except that the case was not cut and drilled to fit exactly.  The holes did not line up.  I was willing to overlook this until I tried to use the device.  The first thing I tested was an inductor. Instead of reading the inductance it read the resistance only of the coil.  Then when finished it would not shut off.  I tried to go through the shutdown procedure by long pressing the test switch but moments later it turned back on without notice and would not shut down.  I had to remove the battery.  Item returned to Amazon.	-1
Shattered in package, parts missing. Save the money. Would give 0 stars or less if possible.	-1
Looks like it would work fine if it came with all the parts. Missing several bolts and nuts to hold it together.	-1
Not really happy with the quality of this temp gun, but it does work. The trigger pull is terrible. feels super low quality in general, but what do we expect for this price? I just think it could be made a bit better at least. the one we got from Harbor Freight is way better.	-1
Piece of junk.  Worked for one week and became wildly unreliable.	-1
Extremely hard to calibrate, prints well when dialed in but doesn't seem to stay that way long. I have spent more time trying to get this printer leveled and working then I have printing. If you don't want to fight for every print get a cartesian printer.	-1
This is a gift for Christmas will let you know	-1
not exactly tough enough for a workshop that gets used.	-1
Poor quality, breaks while installing on the Peg board.	-1
The brush is a cool option but doesnt seem to work so well after a few uses. Probably cause of contamination from what you use it on	-1
I just received my 3D print removal tool and I can confidently say that it is not worth the price. The handles are made of incredibly cheap plastic that is very dull and scratched. Also, the handles are stamped with a 4 and 17 for no apparent reason. It does an okay job of removing parts as would any other removal tool. Basically, there is nothing special about these, so don't waste your money.	-1
These are okay for the price, but both plastic handles came loose after use.  The metal ferrule moved away from the handle, and then when pulling a print off (ABS stuck to the board), the handled pulled off the metal part.  I'm sure epoxy between the plastic and metal would hold everything together.	-1
Nothing but common, cheapo, plastic-handled, art store pallet knives. They still have the numbers on the handle.	-1
Bought a new printer that came with the old extruder. Purchased this and 2 hours into a print job it jammed and now won't load pla at all.	-1
The software installation instructions are contained in a readme file.  I get nothing but error messages when (attempting to) follow the instructions.  Windows 10 cannot decipher the Chinese characters in the driver installation folder name.  So I created a folder on my hard drive, copied the CD files into this folder, and renamed the driver installation folder by deleating the Chinese characters.  Now the driver installation .exe file would at least start.  However, when asked to select the file to install (there was only one choice) I keep getting an "installation failure" message with no indication of what that failure might be.	-1
I have always liked Anker products and especially Anker customer service but this thing was just not good. It lasted a little over two weeks before the roller became clogged with pet hair and the roller motor died. It might be Ok for  light duty or a bare floor but otherwise it is just not good. I did not even waste my time sending it back, it annoyed me so much it went straight in the trash.  I have now gone to consumer reports, read the reviews, and bought one of the well reviewed upright bagless regular power vacs.  UPDATE: As is common with Anker, after reading the review they contacted me and offered an upgraded replacement or refund. Since I have already  bought another vac, I asked for the refund. I cannot rate the vac any higher but did bump my review by one star for the excellent service.	-1
My order wasn't so great.  1 was dead on arrival.  Amazon return started.  No way to contact seller to avoid the return.  The 2nd from the order works.	-1
Perfect trade. bad product.	-1
I got a Lemon that didn't work also I pretty sure it was used because one of the packets of calabration chemicals had been torn opened and used had so much white gunk on it like to never got the black cover off of the unit.	-1
Straps are less than 72 inches	-1
These are not very bright.  I compared several LEDs for this wavelength range with a spectrometer. This one was very low power	-1
not high quality	-1
I have white LEDs from another purchase - they're not that bright so I bought these because they are listed as ULTRA BRIGHT. Not true - they're the same brightness (not very) as the regular ones. But of course not worth the hassle of returning. Just won't be buying from them again.	-1
not 400nm they are 404.5	-1
will not buy again	-1
this is great for the price, the tester is better than the one I bought for almost twice as much as this whole kit cost me. Update, tester lasted about a month, RJ45 crimper lasted about a month, then would not line up with pins on connector. Would not buy again.	-1
I wanted regular white, but they're out. This stuff looks weird, failed on my printer several times and I'm dialed in and rarely have failures. When it doesn't fail its stringy and needs lots if sanding, love this brand and only use this brand but hate this product.	-1
Never did get this stuff to print well.  I've used another brand successfully for so long, I didn't bother to see if I could tweak this or not, I through it out and replaced.  It seemed like maybe a lower temperature would have been better, since this left trails all over my prints.	-1
Worked good for a few times only. By 5th or 6th use completely died.  2nd time around. First one died within 2-3 uses.  Unfortunately TR Ely thus time use was less frequent and I'm past 30 days and can't return.  I won't be buying again.	-1
Well, its a real pretty color and when it lays out, you have a pretty project, but the shrinkage is huge.	-1
Purchased 2 of these for my ATV one for a secondary radiator fan and another for 2 flood lights in the front. One worked perfectly, however, the second one which was connected to the lights decided to stop working mid ride in the middle of the night. I was left without lights due to this faulty switch. It was not until further examination at camp that I figured out the switch was the faulty link using my multi meter. I have replaced both switches now with a higher quality switch. Save yourself the horrible experience and just get a better switch!	-1
I have used Gorilla products for many years, they've got great adhesive power. This is the first time I've used this particular productconstruction adhesive in a tubeand It's almost caused me to swear off using this brand entirely. The consistency of the adhesive and the size of the tube opening means that it is nearly impossible to get and keep the product flowing. Don't think for a moment that you can dispense this adhesive with one hand while you hold anything else with the other: I had to squeeze with both hands just to lay out the bare-minimum thin bead for a marble vanity top.  This type of adhesive needs to be sold in a caulk-gun tube only, there's no other way to get enough force to lay it down properly. Shame on Gorilla for putting this in their line, and making DIY shoppers think this is an easy-to-use glue for small household tasks.	-1
I wanted so badly to love this stuff, but sadly I can't I used it with a hardened steel nozzle and a brass one, at every temperature in the advertised range and this stuff came out looking horribly every time. I tried in 5 degree increments from 190 to 230 and still no joy. The product might work on large flat surfaces but it is far too fibrous to work on any other surface. It does not do well with gaps and never evenly extrudes, I have used filled filaments before, everything from bronze and aluminum to wood, there is a trick usually to all of them to get the best out of it. I stopped trying to figure the trick out after 12 nasty looking prints, save your money and don't even try to go down that rabbit hole unless you are desperate for a large flat black cube that is surprisingly light and crazy expensive for what it is. Then this stuff is perfect. On to the quality issues. the diameter was spot on everywhere I tested it but you will need to rebuild your extruder drive system if you had setup to run TPU at some point. The brass feed teeth have a groove in them after very few uses and you would be better off with steel or at the very least have spares The steel extruder teeth that are best for this will cut the TPU but with withstand the abuse this filament puts them through. The spool however was junk, cardboard garbage that was made to look like you are getting a lot more than you are my spool weight was .41 kg upon arrival the cardboard must be 60+ grams so that means really you are getting .35 kg and a poorly wound .35 kg at that. It does produce a very cool look but it is not any stronger in my experience than PLA in fact in my tests the fibers run only one direction so if commonly failed at layer lines with 20 lbs of pressure on .5" solid peg. The Hatch box black PLA weighed in at 41% more and 1/5 of the price per KG and broke in the same hanging test (at roughly the same point of failure) with 78 lbs of strain unfortunately not flat black and no where near as cool to look at.	-1
Before you purchase this product know that it -WILL- take years off your machine.  The material is highly abrasive and is the equivalent of running sand paper through your machine.  I have an all metal hot end and use hardened steel nozzles.  After 3 prints it still has filed down both to a point where I've had to replace them.  Now, Proto-pasta makes EXCEPTIONAL filament.  However this particular product is just too strong for anything but serious commercial grade printers.  Large prints are just dangerous for your machine.  Check out their wood or stainless steel filament instead.  Great exotic material that's won't destroy your machine.	-1
Honestly, I am not sure what all the hype is about. This filament printed fine at 220C, nice surface look, but terrible mechanical properties... Heat treated it for 60 minutes at 265F, warped and shrunk a little as to be expected I suppose and was not terribly bad, but I was shocked at its really awful mechanical properties. Really what's the point of a carbon fiber part that is more brittle than regular PLA? Snaps clean through with very little force applied, much less than it would take to snap the equivalent PLA part. Not sure what the premium price is for? Maybe bragging rights? It fails to provide any real value and has a huge cost in terms of the expensive nozzles needed to resist the wear. Not to mention risk of health problems from carbon fiber particles. I can see absolutely no practical benefit unless you like brag you printed stuff in carbon fiber. I'll probably finish the spool out just to see if I can find some light at the end of this bleak tunnel, but I won't be reordering. Huge disappointment.	-1
Understood these would fit my scope. They do not. As for the quality I guess it is acceptable for the price but do not recommend.	-1
Not sure what I expected but this epoxy is kind of impossible to work with. It took 18hrs till it was not longer tacky and continued to slowly run the entire time. I followed all the directions for the proportions. It is not something you can undo either sanding it doesn't really fix the globs because it is so high gloss. lost several prints. Might be a bad batch I know the box looked like it was hit by a truck but other than that kit seemed fine. IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE 90% OF FINISH WORK LIKE IT CLAIMS. you are far better off increasing your perimeter layers and getting a good rubber sand paper product. much better every time. might work to seal your flat surfaces. DO NOT TRY TO SAND THIS STUFF!!!!!	-1
I bought this a few Saturdays ago when my Shark had to be sent back to the company for repairs and I needed to vacuum before company came over. I got it for $32 and some change at Target with store discounts, etc. I listened to the good reviews on here and bought it, knowing full-well that a vacuum for $32 wasn't going to be that great (but decided to take a chance). I have had several vacuums in my lifetime, including- Kirby, Riccar, Shark, Dyson, Hoover, Eureka, etc. Assembly was simple and it took my husband very little time to assemble it. We immediately got to using it and did not notice any problems. But, after a few uses we noticed that it constantly became clogged. The clogs were mostly in the hose (which is nearly impossible to remove in order to remove the obstruction) but also in the brush roll part. The vacuum also started taking chunks of my carpet (which is a good quality/thick carpet I might add) and spitting the chunks out. Sorry, but I do not like a vacuum spitting pieces of carpet (and dirt I might add) out at me. A week after buying it, the vacuum began smoking terribly. We realized that it was the belt. I contacted the company to tell them about it and they only gave me tips to remedy this, no offer to replace the vacuum or anything. Also, the gray hose attachment does not want to stay on and falls off while you are vacuuming. I will be glad when my other vacuum returns to my house because I do not have this issue with my Kirby (which has no hose and was my reason for buying this one) nor my Shark.	-1
Well the only thing I can say about this product is that the person who created the instructions and the person who approved them should be fired. You get pictures that are nothing but confusing. I can't even figure out how to get it open by the pictures, much less how to program it. And I work with digitally controlled kilns where I have to program a sequence of timers including holds and incremental ramp downs so I really don't consider myself stupid. See for yourself. I have included photos of the instructions.	-1
These fasteners aren't that strong. I broke off a couple trying to drive (admittedly into relatively hard wood) despite drilling pilot holes and waxing. I'm not going to return them, but I'll only use them for soft woods.	-1
Why pay for a single tool when you can get the entire set for about same price?  Search amazon or your favorite auction side for 'painting knife' or 'palette knife'. For example this one from Amazon&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/uxcell-5-Piece-Painting-Knife-Set/dp/B004669XQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">uxcell 5-Piece Painting Knife Set</a>&nbsp;.

Worked well for a while till i noticed the handle slightly tweaked, a short time later the plastic handle gave out. If it had been wood it would still be in my tool drawer.	-1
When I received these in the mail, I got some plastic tubes, and a lot of them were cracked, and there was a hole that some of them could slip out of. I had to put these in an antistatic bag. When I go and build some stuff, I noticed I had to replace the chips a few times, so there were some defective chips. It was probably due to the poor packaging. All in all, I'm not too pleased, but at least I had enough to get the project I was working on, completed.	-1
quanity received was correct but they arrived in a bubble pouch not protection for the pins can use then with a little pin straightening	-1
I'm glad I ordered the bulk amount as quite a few have turned out to be defecdtive.  This product is sold, in bulk, most likely due to this failure rate. This is more of the 555s than I will ever need but I'll have extras in the storage bin, unless they have even more test bad.	-1
I have a circuit built up to do a couple basic tests on each one.   12 of them failed the tests in one way or another   I wrote to seller they advise they was on vac and would take care of this when they get back.. i never heard from them wrote again and they never replied.  the ones that worked are great.. can always use 555 timers..but next time I will be finding another seller..  I used Smiths Depot others seller sell the  same descriptive item this review does not reflect on any other seller	-1
These two 5" rolls of stretch wrap DO NOT come with a dispenser, as advertised in the description.  They have 1.25" O.D. cardboard tubes sticking out of them which make it impossible to apply the wrap one handed.  The old Bankers Box rolls came with a dispenser that allowed the rolls to rotate, so the wrap could be dispensed one-handed.	-1
will not buy again	-1
Printed out shoulder armor for a Keyleth cosplay.  The material was very hard to stick to the surface of my MP ultimate.  I bought this to save money instead of getting hatchbox, and I was mistaken.  After troubleshooting, I did find that I needed to lower the speed which this was the only filament I had to.  However once fully printed, the shoulder armor was less detailed than I had hoped, compared to other prints.  I will spend the extra bit for the hatchbox black filament.	-1

Would've been better off slipping heat shrink tubing over a standard butt connector and sealing it that way. These things were worthless trying to heat shrink after crimping. I tried using a heat gun, bic lighter, and a pocket propane torch. You would melt the wire you were splicing before you could seal the connection with these. Over priced garbage.	-1
These are junk.  Don't waste your money.	-1
will not buy again	-1
Disappointed in the quality.  Not at all worth the price.  These are a bit difficult to tighten and have to be tightened by hand--there is no ratchet.  They will not work on large items.  I tried them to move a small bookcase.  I felt very unsure of the security of the strapping and, consequently, drove slower and felt anxious for the entire five blocks.  I used them inside the SUV to secure items and that worked out fine.  I also plan to use them to strap together a few boxes to help my son move his items more easily.  The problem is that these are not adequate for typical application in which you would want to use lashing straps.  If you need them for jobs inside the home or inside a trunk or cargo area of a vehicle, then they might be handy--but keep in mind they can only do small jobs as they are not long enough or wide enough for anything else.  Bottom line:  save your money.	-1

This Amazon used product arrived with 11 parts missing and the machine doesn't work. Last used anything I buy from Amazon.  I wanted to review this even worse, it is junk, but Amazon keeps telling me I can't say that. The truth is not allowed on reviews.	-1
A small amount quieter. Really not huge. Probably could make a better one with homemade stuff.	-1
Very glitchy unit, bad firmware. Totally not worth the price. Will be shopping for another brand.	-1
this unit drains the battery quickly. Imagine a situation of Nuke radiation around and to get this thing working you need to go to the shop frequently to get the battery!. Also, the user manual says there is an icon showing the backlight status. but there is none. and also there is no settings to program the backlight duration. the alarm sound compared to the yellow competitor is bad as well. it confuses people as it make the same old gritty sound. The reason why i did not buy the yellow competitor was bcoz it had tiny screen and no backlight. but apparently it seems to have better battery life, sensitivity and alarm sound. gonna send this one back and buy the yellow puppy.	-1
Had a horrible time trying to make it work. I tried everything. It just wasn't consistent throughout the print like my usual filaments.	-1
Spool inserts were broken, and spool itself warped so it rubbed on spool rollers. Filament kinked and wound poorly on spool. Would not buy again.	-1
Using these on a hot nozzle will loosen the glue holding the bit into the handle making these not useful for their stated purpose. You might actually end up with a bit stuck up in your nozzle meaning these can cause more problems than they solve.	-1
For those that have never seen one of these, the picture is a little misleading. These things are seriously tiny. They are so tiny that even though each of the drill bits are bent at an angle where they joined them to the tiny handles, I don't dare try to straighten them for fear of breaking them off. Basically these were a waste of time and money for me. I feel like you would leave significant scratches inside the nozzle if you tried to use theses to clear a clog. There is Save yourself the time and aggravation and just replace the nozzle instead (I hade great luck with "3D Printer Head(6PCS),6PCS 3D Printer 0.4mm Extruder Brass Nozzle Print Head for MK8 1.75mm ABS PLA Printer(0.4mm)" )	-1

TEMPERATURE READINGS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. I CHECK THE SAME SURFACE 2 TIMES AND GET TWO VERY DIFFERENT READINGS. USUALLY MORE THAN 5 DEG. F. DIFFERENCE EACH TIME.  I CHECK ICE WATER WITH MY UEI TEMP GUN AND GET VERY CLOSE TO 32 DEG F. EVERY TIME. I CHECK WITH THE FLUKE AND GET A HIGHER TEMP SO I SET THE EMS DOWN TO ABOUT 90 AND GET 32 DEG. F. THEN WAIT 30 SECONDS AND GET 42 DEG F. THIS WAS A HUGE WAST OF MONEY. DOESN'T LIVE UP TO THE OLD RELIABLE FLUKES I USED TO USE.	-1
these were not what i thought they are	-1
Came slightly bent took it care of that with differential lock and a 6mm hardened steel tube on my lath and spun it slow after applied heat while moving the hardened steel down the rod. Sanded it and applied it to my 3d printer as I needed more support for my gantry. Needless to say I needed it so I kept it but if you don't have the skills to fix what you got go buy one in person somewhere.	-1
This hydrometer broke on me while measuring my specific gravity of wort directly out of the mash tun. I heard no crack or anything. Just poured, and it shot to the top of the liquid because the bottom piece broke. Not pleased.	-1
Low cost/low quality filament. Four or five brittle portions (broke coming off roll) at beginning of roll (first 10 or 15M) forced switch with better filament instead of having to babysit a long print. Will update review if/when I start on roll again	-1
This filament has no structural integrity and this review is based on my settings in Slic3r did not change using another brand which I printed a GoPro five mount and the other brand is like abs compared to this brand. I was new to this world of 3D printing when I purchased this so I didn't know any better so now with several months, a hundred prints and trying multiple filaments this is by far the absolute worst filament on the market and its true to this game that you get what you pay for so please don't make the mistake I did and save a few dollars because it will cost you a lot in aggravation and stress.	-1
It is a waste of money. The shapes are not imaginative. They are plain and boring. The refill kit is fine and has a high quality refills for a 3D Doodler pen. The green shape plates are too plain in design. They are also absolutely unnecessary. Any child can copy, draw, and trace such simple shapes using a piece of paper and a 3d doodler. It is irresponsible use of plastics that pollutes our environment. These will be used a few times and tossed to landline.	-1
The 3Doodler Start Rocket & Robot DoodleBlock Kit is an addon. To use the kit, it is essential to also have the 3Doodler pen, like what's included in the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/3Doodler-Start-Mega-Box-Set-3D-Printing-Pen/dp/B01CL1FCLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">3Doodler Start Mega Box Set 3D Printing Pen</a>. Luckily I realized that the 3D pen was necessary before inadvertently exciting our little robot lover. For now, the kits tucked away, hidden until I decide if Ill pop for the pen. Since it wasn't possible to use the kit, I can only comment that I appreciate any toy that inspires creativity. For that reason, I find the 3Doodler an exciting proposition. It just cant yet be fulfilled. For now, Ill rate the kit okay. Please consider enhancing the web page description to stress that the pen is not included. ****  comments below reflect reason for downgrading review from 3 stars to 1 ***	-1
This set is completely useless without the pen, and it isn't clear at all that the pen is NOT included in the set. Even if you had the correct pen - this only works with the 3Doodler Start Child Safe pen - you get very little for your money. a couple disk type templates and a variety of color refills. THey truly need to make their description and packaging much more clear.	-1
Here is the product description at the time I ordered this:  "Jewelry DoodleBlock Kit, complete with two packs of 3Doodler Start Eco-Plastic. 3Doodler Start DoodleBlocks are special 3D templates to help you create some of our favorite projects."  To me, Jewlery DoodleBlock Kit, complete with... indicates you are getting a "complete" DoodleBlock Kit.  Clearly I am not alone, judging from the large number of other upset reviewers. Handheld 3D printers were new last Christmas, and even then many of them were not expensive. So it seemed believable that a _starter kit_ would be $15 and include all you needed to do a few projects and then order more supplies to do more. What is not believable is that they would be this misleading in the product description and pictures.  It should be called something like "Jewelry Kit FOR 3 Doodler 3D Pen" or anything that doesn't create dozens of reviews where the purchaser thought they were getting a functionable product and not just supplies for a product.  This is essentially a SUPPLY PACK for the 3 Doodler 3D Pen.  It is NOT a "3Doodler Starter Kit" or a "DoodleBlock Kit."  I do not think the manufacturer deliberately did this to fool people, but that doesn't excuse the fact that it is so poorly described. Most supply packs like this have warnings or labeling that makes it clear that the required primary device isn't actually included so that this kind of mistake doesn't happen. These days, even OBVIOUS things (like say you order an iPhone protector case for $7, they will still say "DOES NOT INCLUDE IPHONE" even though no one would think it included an iPhone.) have warnings - this kit is grossly negligent in not making that clear.  1 star until they fix the labels to keep people from wasting their time and money on a product that doesn't include the needed device to actually use the product for anything. Disappointing.	-1
Buyer beware- The tip broke off within two weeks of my daughter using it and the mfg does not stand by there warranty. I purchased one for our daughter 12/24/17 and was told by 3doodler that because they discontinued the color champagne two years ago (according to them, not sure how Michael's Crafts would even have it then) it was out of warranty and they would not replace it. When we just purchased it brand new from Michael's craft and I submitted the receipt to show proof of purchase as they requested. Nor did they offer to refund for the plastic strips I purchased that she won't be using. Very Disappointing, they were great with corresponding until I sent them a copy of my receipt and replied with the item was out of warranty. Which how would I know I bought a brand new item from Michael's.	-1

I've got a 3Doodler 2.0 first, purchased locally, which was complete junk (see customer reviews for 2.0 here on Amazon). Was able to return it and purchase a 3Doodler Create. All I can say is that this is probably the most frustrating technical/creative present I've ever purchased for my kids.  I also own a 3D printer, so I have some idea about basic physics of plastic filament deposition modeling and thermal properties of various plastics. This pen doesn't take into account even basic physics of the extrusion process. Cold section of the nozzle feeding tube is too short, which puts the cold thermal break way too close to the feeding gear. Feeding is based on a worm gear, which is hardly adequate when used with hard plastics (e.g. PLA). Very little has been done to properly calibrate retraction (the part when the plastic is "sucked" back into the nozzle to prevent oozing). The results are rather underwhelming -- excessive oozing with Flex filament, large gaps in extrusion when stopping and starting again, almost guaranteed clogging when changing plastics and so on.  The last straw that prompted me to return the pen was when on a plastic change the smaller segment of the plastic noodle that was already in the nozzle got melted at the tail end when being pushed by the new plastic noodle I fed from the back of the pen. The result was an unrecoverable clog, as the melted portion ended up being thicker than the nozzle would allow to feed forward and thicker than the opening of the feeding mechanism so it won't feed backwards either. As the extruder in this pen is not customer serviceable (the "service" opening is a joke), the result was a solid plug of plastic which is impossible to remove.  You can say that my expectations were too high, but at the times when you can purchase a decent 3D printer for $300, I expected a little bit more from a $100 3D pen.	-1
This device was not able to work on a Win 8 pc or an android.  For android use, you need a QR scanner to grab the application. In any case, this camera did not work.	-1
Does not work...pos... buy at yur risk	-1
You have to install a non-certified app to use this at all. There doesn't seem to be anything malicious, but it's not certain. Any time you have to disable a security feature to use a product, it's not great.	-1
This is a good idea but not a good product. Not reliable and have not been able to use it even tested it on several android devices.	-1
Good idea but didn't work on my phone. I tried to get the software and scope to work several time before giving up and posting a question on the selling page. I had to send it back. I wish they would have made a chart of what Androids it worked with and which it didn't. Would have saved me and the seller a lot of hassle	-1
Didn't work for me.	-1
This is specifically the bronze variety.  I bought two spools, the first one worked fairly well, but the second one has snapped on two out of three prints, and if a print completes and the printer sits in place for a while the filament will usually snap, causing me wasted material and time removing the broken piece of filament.  Also, on the second spool the printer seems to be underextruding, and occasionally delivering a fat layer, leading me to believe that this filament may have inconsistencies with regard to thickness. Changing to another filament immediately resolves the issue, eliminating the possibility that it's a printer issue.  EDIT - August 3, 2016 - This bronze filament is VERY hit and miss and I can't recommend it. The first spool worked well apart from occasionally breaking near the end of the roll, but the second spool purchased is utter trash. It is either full of bubbles or water. I put it into an oven set at 175F four three hours in an attempt to dry it out and after letting it cool and trying a new print it is still crackling and popping like crazy, and print layers look terrible and inconsistent. The filament itself is dimensionally accurate at exactly 1.75mm according to my digital calipers, so I can only conclude that the stuff is either so full of water that it can't be dried with three hours baking in an oven, of that it's full of bubbles.	-1
It was not dark green	-1
The manufacture claims this is metal infused or metal filled by 80% PLA and 20% metal. I find zero evidence to support this claim. It's weight is the exact same as normal PLA. If it is metal filled it is so light and has zero metal quality then what is the point. When sanded it looses all its luster and can not be polished like ColorFabb can. ColorFabb is metal infused for real. This stuff is a joke. You get what you pay for I guess. ColorFabb may be a bit more money but it is the real deal and no, I do not work for ColorFabb. This stuff is not even close.	-1
It said it has a shrinkage ratio of 2:1, which is 1/2 of its diameter. I cannot agree with that. It's more like a 2/5. I had a better luck with another brand, which gives me a better shrinkage than it claimed.	-1
I am glad these were cheap, but I guess I got what I paid for. Out of the five of these included in my order, a grand total of ZERO worked. They all failed to report back any range data, and to be honest, I am not certain they were sending out the ping.  I tried several methods of coding them, pulled known working code, and even made it as simple as possible, just trying to get a ping/echo value to be reported to the serial console. Nothing, not on any of them, not when I tried different Arduino pins and different jumpers. I know the code was working because I could artificially generate a signal on the 'echo' pin and get a value, but as soon as any of these were attached, zero, nada and nothing.  I have since gone and ordered, coded and integrated a higher-quality Maxbotix Ultrasonic Rangefinder - HRLV-EZ1. Now, my project is up and running. Too bad I had to go through the time, effort and yes, a little cash with these pieces of junk.	-1
Out of three pieces received, one arrive good, one broken where the glass tube and bulb meet, and one with the bulb glued to the glass tube making washing near impossible.  The ok unit works well, great for measuring and transferring acid to a mash tun.  The other two, not so much.	-1
This is a Small tool. Not in the same league with Sterrett. I should just have bought a premium product to begin with. This will do the job, but at my age, it is toooooo small to read.	-1

Variable speed control doesn't run slow enough. can hardly tell the difference. Have other fans with independent speed controls that work much better. would not buy this again	-1
Horrible  PTFE tubing.  You can't use this tube for two reasons.  either it's smaller than 1.5mm ID  in spots or it's so large the filament springs inside it!  Stay away from this one!  I have bought this sellers products befoe*  Same item and it was not garbage like the one he sent!  Verry disappointing!	-1
Completely useless. The interior diameter varies throughout the entire tube leading to clogs. I've cut it into pieces, but the diameter varies so much throughout that even finding a good 30mm out of the entire 2 meters was a frustrating task.  Whats with all the crap products for 3d printing flooding amazon lately? There used to be such better consistency with products.	-1
Came folded,  so it was useless.  It needs to come in a proper coil.	-1
Filament stuck in tube in several different places. Id say you get what you pay for, but i paid for an inner diameter of 2mm and didn't get it.	-1
Much darker/greyer green than what the picture shows.  I was looking for an apple (yellow-ish) green	-1
Checked all 20 diodes out of the bag using my Fluke 117 True RMS multimeter (diode checker function). The readings were all over the place (like there is a QC issue with the doping of these diodes). Ten of them while testing forward/reverse current "chirped" on the diode function (prob okay, but had a higher impedance). All indicated "open" when reversing the leads. The other ten had a long steady tone (indicating a short...which is fine). Those ten also showed "open" when reversing the leads. From what I can tell...half of these are probably okay, and the other half questionable. Not recommended.	-1
Extremely low melting point, clogs up print head immediately. No good for 3d printers. There's no way this is actual PTFE	-1
These are butt splice connectors.  What do you expect?  No better or worse than any others I've seen.  I regret buying these, and ended up throwing them away and using solder and heat shrink wrap as this approach looks much cleaner, doesn't leave the possibility for something to come in contact with the exposed metal near the ends, and conducts electricity better.	-1
These do not crimp well.	-1
These are junk. The contacts in many of the holes are slightly misaligned, so if you stick a wire in from the wrong angle it will jam and not go in. I wasn't even aware that this was an issue that breadboards could have before this. Do yourself a favor and get a different brand.	-1
The scale has died after just a few months of use.	-1
Horrible. Price does not match perfomance, First let me just say that this is not my first 3D printer. I have owned several 3D printers over the past four years. I also print professionally for my Consulting business that has to do with aerospace engineering. My main work horses for my company are flashforge Creator Pro printers. They work around the clock 24/7 with only minor needs for leveling the build platform and refilling the filament.  I bought a Taz 6 with the expectation that I was going to get another work horse like flashforge. Unfortunately that was far from the truth. The Taz 6 is a product "in development" at best. It Is by no means a device to be used to run a business or to get reliable and repeatable printing 24/7 like the Flash Forge.  Here are some of the problems that I encountered. The unit failed several times to auto level. It took several phone calls to customer support to address the issue. The initial prints showed problems with Z axis. Additional phone calls to customer support indicated that the z-axis had alignmnet issues. According the customer support they stated that the z axis gets damaged and/or shifted during shipping and requires recalibration by the end-user. Recalibration/realignmnet means that you have to actually take apart some the support pillars and performer realignment.  Bed adhesion was another issue. The heated bed showed problems with uniform heating across the entire bed surface. Sme parts of the bed are hotter than others. I also apparently had a failed temperature sensor which led to all kinds of other issues which again required customer support involvement.  After all that was addressed print quality was very unreliable with had bad repeatability. At a price tag of $2,500 I expected a more professional and robust machine. The Taz 6 is not that.  I have also bought a pursa i3 mark to back in December as a kit just for fun and found it to be printing a hundred times more reliably and better than the $2,500 Taz 6. And the prusa cost $750.  As for comparison to the Creator Pro there was none. Do you want to know how many phone calls to customer support I've made to Creator Pro since I first bought the printers? Zero. I have had no issues whatsoever after thousands and thousands of hours of printing with a Creator Pro. And for a price tag of $800 that's pretty amazing. So at the end of the day I shipped my $2,500 "development kit" back to Amazon and got a refund. I think Lulzbot does a diservice to its customers by not clearly identifying that this is a development kit it not a production workhorse type 3D printer as the want you to belive.  In my opinion it is not for professional use I would not even recommend it for amature use.  It's more of a learning tool to educate students as to how 3D printer works and continue to tweak it and modify it as a learning tool. If people here want a reliable printing machine that can dish out hundreds and hundreds of hours of reliable 3D prints they need to look elsewhere. I cannot help but continue to recommend the flashforge Creator over and over again.  I would have liked to have owned a newer machine but it seems that there's nothing out there in the market currently that is more reliable than flashforge for now for professional work. I am hoping 2017 will change this.  My wishlist would be:  1. Dual extruders (or multi extruder) 2. Enclosure (a must !) 3. 50 micron / 400mm speed. 4. Flexion style head for specialized filaments and nylon. 5. Open format. 6. Wifi, SD and USB interface. 7. Price less than $1500.	-1
Not a good spray bottle, barely used for 5 sprays now the spring that props the head back up won't work anymore. Have to manually hold the head up and down to get any spray to come out... try something else.	-1
another piece of junk i threw out. you can't get the solder to melt before the heat shrink is ruined.	-1
Cheap Junk	-1
This is junk. The center punch did not work! Returned to amazon.	-1
Way too flimsy for 3D printing removal tools.  Maybe the smallest one can be useful in some cases, but the larger ones  do not have the rigidity required for raft removal.	-1
really weak and cheaply made	-1

My mistake i though it was a .001 caliper but its just a .01 which makes its a somewhat precise ruler. Has stupid battery compartment issue where a slight touch screws it up which is where you have to hold it, kinda dumb design most calipers suffer from.	-1
This isn't carbon fiber.  This is ultra cheap, dollar store plastic.  It is fairly accurate, but should not be described as carbon fiber.	-1
Worked for a week or so.  Now it kind of turns itself on and off at random as I'm using it.  Rarely able to get a useable reading.	-1
these made me really mad because they didn't have the depth reader like they said the would so. buyer beware. its alright though i guess. kinda flimsy, they need some way to lock them down too, but overall not a terrible product.	-1
It took me 3 weeks to figure out the best way to use this and its still not great.  Even with the modifications to my slicer settings, it still jams a lot.  I still have to clean it out at least once a week due to jams.  DON'T use your old PLA and ABS settings you used with your old PTFE tube hot end as you will get nothing but clogs.  Also I got no thermal paste material in my kit which was a tiny little box.  You will need to get some as it works better with the paste applied.  I had no way to accurately measure the 1.7mm height mentionened in the instructions when installed originally and I just eyeballed it.  It proved disastrous to my prints with terrible clogs and overheated equipment.   I am still not happy about this coming in a tiny little box with no printed instructions.  I watched a video on YouTube on installing it, not knowing there were printed instructions you could download.  After I disassembled and reassembled the unit a couple of times and finally bought and used a digital caliper to measure the height of the hot end in the block, added thermal paste, it began working better.   It doesn't clog as often as it used to but still does.  However, every time filament is replaced, it clogs and must be thoroughly reprimed with the new filament before attempting a print.   Also every filament material I use now must be printed 10 - 20 degrees hotter than with the old brass hot end.  Also DO NOT use any major retraction settings or the upper metal tube clogs easily.  Materials that have high amounts of stringiness can not be solved by increasing the retraction rate or distance.  This hot end hates retraction and will clog if you use retraction.  I found it easier to clean up my PETG stringy prints than to increase the retraction and never finish a print due to clogs.  So in summation,  while I'm not sure that I won't eventually replace this hot end with something else, I at least got it somewhat working.  I still wouldn't recommend it.  Stick with your brass low temp setup until you can afford a better hot end like a flexion or E3DV6.  Final update 11/2017...I finally just removed this thing.  I just print with PLA, PETG and the original hotend on both my printers now.  I also tried the Reprap one sold at Amazon and it too had exactly the same flaws.	-1
I choose Amz3d for its reputation and product reviews. I've purchased Hatchbox, Inland, and Hictop and never had an issue. This filament however, came in with the filimant warped and not straight. I printed a benchy to test the filament/temperature and quickly noticed color variances. The spool also locked it self because of how the filament was wound up. Poor product, would not purchase again.	-1
Horrible quality. The metal on these terminals are so weak that they won't even stay on a standard lug. There is no "spring" to the metal, so it has no holding power.	-1
The endoscope worked well and still does however when recovering the cable detached from the shell. The gluing is not proper and I where able to reconnect it. Still working but not watertight anymore.	-1
The software does not work with the new version of android with the new version android! Wlll try to contact seller to get tech.. support	-1
I have an 8 node TENS machine and have been trying to find a reasonably priced replacement for the electrodes.  These are not them. Out of the first 8 that I put on, HALF OF THEM "bit" into my skin, shocking through the pad and drawing blood even on the lowest setting. These have so far been the worst.  The only reason for one star is because the adhesive did not cause a reaction on my skin.	-1
I have a "tiny" home and very limited space.  I am using these hooks to hold my potholders on my stainless fridge.  They are extremely strong.  They are more than strong enough to hold my terry potholders.  I am not sure what else I will use them for, but they are useful. They arrived quickly  (I have prime).  I will say that they come disassembled.  You will need to screw the hooks into the magnet bases.  Easy peasy.  I always update my reviews if new info would be helpful. UPDATE:  8/2016... they work great... HOWEVER... if you are using on your stainless steel fridge... do NOT drag them across the metal.. it will scratch.  Also...several of the magnets have come loose and I've had to reglue them in so, I have dropped one star in my review. UPDATE:  11/9/2016.... Ok... now I have had to reglue the magnest on every single one of these.  Grrrrr...... Quality control is not good.  I would not order again.	-1
Very thin and very rough tape	-1
I thoroughly cleaned the area where I put the tape down five days ago. The brown tape is already beginning to come loose.	-1
Does not work as expected .cannot get cal and will not print larger model,	-1
I was very excited to get this printer, and I was very close to put it all together (about 90%) until I realize that I was missing some parts and a fan was missing one cable, none of them are a big deal, but the problem is that getting the parts will take some days more, and there is a reason why I pay Prime, I actually paid a little extra to get 1 day shipping so I can put this together in the weekend.  It is not good that they don't really verify all the pieces in the package before sending them, and it is a waste of money and time for both ends.	-1
I want to like this, but there is so much wrong so far only about 1/10th the way done. First I was missing the M3 nuts, so drove into town, 5 miles, and back for the m3 nuts I needed. Then I got to a part of the build section 14 with the instructions call it an Endstop, Part one of PDF calls it an axis belt clip. I can't find anything even closely like that, and nothing that small. I am afraid, to ask just for this part, and then find out that there is more missing. They got this thing to me in 24 hours, so should be able to send me a whole new one that quick. I am unreasonable when it comes to spending this much money. I expect everything to be available when I get it, unless it states else where what I must supply. Also the screw I am supposed to use to hold this thing on the frame calls for a m3*10, which I do not have, and are not even listed on pdf 1. Also, the link to the instruction video goes to a bunch of youtube clips, none of them the instructions for this printer. They need to fix this. I will up to 5 start if they fix it all. I tried to get in touch with them, but couldn't find any way to do it after I contacted them with the feedback button. I can't go back and change it or delete it to add the rest I have found. I either want my money back. or everything I need to get this thing built. Half a day wasted for a few freaking nuts and crap. I am very upset about this.	-1
Horrible. I am not one to leave negative reviews, but I need to warn you about this product. I spent hours of time and extra money trying in vain to get this thing to work. The customer service is awful, I ended up needed to use them twice (neither of which fixed the machine). It is garbage.  Spend more and get something that works.	-1
Very disappointed in the specifications of the belt.  Received the belt and it looked a little slim.  I measured it with calipers and it is not a 6mm belt but more like 5.6mm.	-1

Never did get it to print properly. sent it back.	-1
I got this to control the speed of a brush type grinder motor. I had to return it because it did not reduce the speed very much. Also, the case is totally plastic, with no metal heat sink on the back to dissipate the heat produced by the power semiconductor, so it would get very hot inside if used at significant current very long. Probably ok for low current or intermittent use. I can see why it is not UL or CE certified.	-1
I do not recommend this item. I was going to use it with an attic fan, and I was testing the fan and this item together for the last four days. The fan is a brush type motor, so they should be compatible. Tonight the speed controller failed, and the fan will only run in the high range, with very little speed adjustment. It was working perfectly for the past four days. The fan only draws 1.5 amps, and the capacity of this controller is 15 amps, so it could not have been overloaded. I will have to find a better product.	-1

Beware of fake reviews. It is impossible for this product to have such reviews, period. I am an advanced user and this is the worst plastic I have ever experienced, EVER. I print difficult to print materials such as nylon, ABS, TPU on daily basis and know what I am doing. I also have never had my extruder clogged once, if this adds to my credibility. In 4 years of printing I have never experienced such a low quality product. Diameter tolerance is horrible, I bought 3 different spools of 3 different colors just to make sure I did not get a single bad spool, as I love PLA/PHA matte finish and the idea in general. None of 3 spools is going anywhere close to 1.75mm, they all are 1.62-1.72, which will convert into horrible inconsistent extrusion and a bad print. Apart from diameter, there are actual plastic mixture problem. While magenta color material itself is OK, white product has serious issues with both - plastic itself and inconsistent diameter. I wanted to love this plastic due to matte finish, but it is not possible to make it work even for an advanced user like myself. Save your time, shop for a better brand. I will probably buy some more expensive brand PLA+ now and wait until hatchbox comes out with their PLA+ if they ever do. Once I find good quality PLA+ I will never go back to PLA, that is for sure. But eSun won't have any of my business, that is a fact too. Apart from their unfair business practice with faking customer r eviews, their product is garbage in general. I do like some of their colors though.	-1
Prints are decent...however terribly coiled in the reel.  Continued getting tangled throughout the prints.  As a result, it created endless jams.	-1
Terrible to work with, very unforgiving (unlike most PLA).  eSun PLA+ might as well be ABS - slips on the extruder with any amount of feed resistance which ends up clogging the nozzle; extremely sensitive to cooling and warping.  Does not work well on heated bed as it should - sometimes works on heated blue tape.	-1
I run a small print farm (10 machines) and i fulfill print orders daily with experience in ABS, PLA, PET, TPU, and many more filaments,. ill not go as far as to claim being an expert but I know my way around a 3d printer and I know PLA. First of this is not PLA, i accidentally ordered this rather than my standard monthly order of eSun Black PLA and for about a day i though i had gone nuts because non of my printers would print it with my standard PLA filament profiles until i finally noticed the "pro" on the label and looked up the difference. Esun if your listening, please make it more obvious that your dealing with something different here, because while this may be primarily PLA, it won't print at PLA temps, and its print characteristics are dramatically different than PLA, my conclusion is it must have some kind of additive or blend of another thermoplastic going on here.  Trying to not hold the mis-order (on my end) and pore choice of naming (on eSuns end) against this "pro" filament now knowing it was something completely different i went at it like i would any experimental filament essentially running it through test after test to generate a new profile just for it.  From my testing, what i found was a thermoplastic that does have a little bit stronger layer to layer bonding than raw PLA, but preformed poorly on overhangs, bridging, and most likely due to the higher print temps (~15-20c higher than PLA) did very poorly with small details (when layer times reduce) i was able to combat all of that a bit with aggressive cooling and dramatically reducing print speeds during short (time) print layers, but who has time for that kind of hand holding when standard PLA prints like a dream and is less finicky. my conclusion is eSun calls this stuff PRO because you have to be a pro to handle how finicky it is. and after a few dozen torture test prints i was printing far better than when i started, but i still cant get it to print as cleanly as true/pure PLA.  Ultimately this PLA's one selling point is stronger, great, but my argument back would be that there are a number of stronger filaments available on the market that print better.  And just to prove I am not a eSun competitor bashing their pro line, I will be returning the rest of my eSun "pro" filament that i accidently ordered, but immediately ordering the normal eSun PLA that i know prints wonderfully and is plenty strong if printed correctly. actually i just looked an its out of stock, eSun if you are listening, please, PLEASE bring back your normal 1.75mm PLA black, this "Pro" does not like your "Pro" PLA, but loves your normal PLA.

eSUN 3mm Orange PLA PRO (PLA+) 3D Printer Filament 1KG Spool (2.2lbs), Actual Diameter 2.85mm +/- 0.05mm, Orange I purchased the Orange and I am not happy with the color.. It really looks orange in the photos but is more of a peach color and even more Peachy once printed	-1
I will update my review after I print something with it regarding its quality. Since eSun has such a good reputation I am sure it is a good quality filament.  However, right now I am very annoyed/disappointed that they labeled this grey filament as silver.  I mean I guess we could debate it over a color chart but I sure look like bland old grey to me.  With silver I would print things like "aluminum" car wheels or chrome strips for a car. With this color I would print a WWII battleship or an old ladies hair. .  Maybe I am being a baby but I sure feel let down right now.	-1
I always been using 1.75mm filament, recently I bought an Ultimaker2+ and since colorfabb and 3mm filament are expensive with regards to this type I decided to try it what the worse could happen right? Ultimaker printer is $2500 not a cheap printer, and it really print well, it came with 1 PLA spool from Ultimaker that it cost $50. it worked fine and great, with that filament, I bought this and I use it on ultimaker only took 5min to jam my feeder that I had to take it apart on a new expensive printer to pull it out, it seems that this brand on PLA is very brittle and not uniform in diameter lucky I was able to save my printer and took me 3 hours after midnight to fix it, as this would have damaged the printer I would had to file a lawsuit against this company.  I don't know if any of you did print with this brand on Ultimaker if you do please let me know how?	-1
eSUN 1.75mm Black PLA PRO (PLA+) prints with an obscene amount of strings. I have used several different colors from eSUN and this Black PLA is the first that produces so many strings in the print process. I have eSUN's Purple and Grey and they both print marvelously. Im using them at 200c-215c with very smooth results. This black PLA strings at all tested temperatures. 190c-215c. I understand some stringing is to be expected on some prjects but just look at the attached picture. Thats standard 15% infill. Look at all them strings.	-1
I bought here a Safavieh runner made from a very tough textile. It had been rolled up tightly and just did not want to lay flat. I had difficulty getting the ends to stay down as well as parts in the middle wanting to ride up. I was using this tape already on other rugs but it was not working :&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Optimum-Technologies-Lok-Lift-Rug-Gripper-Slip-Resistant-Rug-Tape-for-Rugs-and-Mats-2-5-Inches-by-25-Feet/dp/B000UGT4RY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Technologies Lok Lift Rug Gripper Slip-Resistant Rug Tape for Rugs and Mats, 2.5-Inches by 25-Feet</a>&nbsp;. So I decided to try this Melca double sided tape. It did not work and I did request a refund for the unused portion, which Amazon approved. The ad claims a few things so I will address them all. I also posted a photo of the floor after taking up the rug - I am not sure how I will get it off, I ordered acetone to try that. The rubber backed rug I put over the tape until I can get it off did not want to come off when I wanted to take the photos.  I recommend if you have tile floors to try something else, like the Lok Lift tape I used. It both holds and comes off fine.  "Highest viscosity available provides the strongest and longest hold, Leaves absolutely no residue"  The tape left no residue on the CARPET but the floor is another story. I used a lot of the tape trying to get the rug to stay down, and when I pulled up rug to return it, the tape all stayed behind. If i walk on it, I cannot get my foot/shoe off without a struggle. What a mess. "Stream out a long strand without it becoming totally stuck and wrapped around something" This is not the case. This is the MOST sticky tape I have ever dealt with. If it touches anything before you get it on the rug or floor, it will stick and does not want to easily come off.  "Optimal weight and pliability, the best tape on the market is easy to handle, apply and remove" I already spoke of how it is NOT easy to remove. Maybe they mean from the carpet, but they need to think about tile floors!	-1
It came with batteries installed and I think this was sold previously. Calibration doesn't work. manual states to push the cal button long and then on/off short to exit. This doesn't make sense because there is nothing to exit. No idea what this thing is doing afterwards. It also doesn't make sense that you have to use the 7pH solution a second time, because you had to dump the solution for the 4 pH. Complete waste.  One look at the label explains why this thing isn't deigned well.  MADE IN CHINA. Total crap.  Will send back to Amazon and get a commercial / lab grade meter made in Germany. Even if it will cost me $1k. I'm so done with this cheap crap from China.	-1
These meters are trash. Amazon has been great in sending me 2 replacements but the first 2 arrived damaged, the 3rd one worked for about a week or so but now it won't calibrate to the 4.0 solution. It just says er1. Very disappointing being that i thought i was stepping up in quality and price, turns out it was just a step up in price.	-1
Junk	-1
My brother received one of these for his birthday and nearly had to go to the ER as he had a violent allergic reaction to it!  This was even before trying to print anything, just as he was trying to assemble the parts that he started having a reaction.  As a result, he had his son come and take it away as apparently the son has had no reaction so far... but I have advised him to be sure and use it in a ventilated area once he starts printing.  Research shows a variety of substances are released as the printing process commences and not all of them good!  Remember that these are low melting point plastics and just about any plastic can outgas when melted (or even before being melted in my brother's case I think).  I believe my brother's reaction occurred due to the outgassing of one of the plastic rolls included with the unit.  Luckily, the unit was removed in time for my brother to make a full recovery after visiting the MD and getting a shot of steroids to lessen the swelling in his hands.  UPDATE 3/21/18:  Still no working unit after over a year.  My nephew tried to assemble this, I tried to assemble it, and then a friend of my nephew's tried to assemble it.  Because the instructions are so haphazard and vague, it is over a year and still no working printer... total waste of money.  Now they sit there with a pile of metal and plastic scrap.  Is there anywhere to send it where it would get properly assembled and at what cost?  Might make an enormous difference in this review.	-1
I have owned this printer for 2 months now. I have to say that it's falling apart. I have had so many pieces break, including: 1. The main acrylic frame. 2. Filament holder. 3. Extruder Head 4. Heat bed is badly warped. 5. I also purchased an extra extruder nozzle. It was  broken out of the package. 6. filament monitor switch was broken out-of-the-box.  If you are thinking of buying this printer, PLEASE trust me and do not puy it. It's absolute garbage. Their support is terrible. I tried working with them, but they only offer replacement of broken parts. The problem is that these parts will just break again. The acrylic frame is sooo fragile, that It broke when I first put it together. My frame is now glued together. Their support finally stopped replying to me emails. If you buy this, you WILL have to purchase a better stand makde of a better material. When I got the printer, it did not have the correct firmware. I also purchased the self-leveling switch and it required new firmware that took 2 weeks to get from their support. The printing software that comes with it (cura) is outdated. I downloaded the latest version and it does NOT support this printer nor does it have a hardware profile for this printer.  Cons: The body is made of acrylic and I have already broke 2 pieces. print extruder broke after 5 prints (had to print one) did not come with most current instructions. they need to make it easier to get the correct firmware (without emailing them)  Suggestions if you buy this: 1. RETURN IT 2. some of the parts are 3d printed.. print backups of these parts (found on thingverse) 3. set it on a stable surface (i use cork) so the y-axis is stable and cannot vibrate. It is so flimsy, that it goes out ot true.	-1
Piece of junk. put it together only to find out the stopper switches didn't work and calibrating was therefore impossible save your money and pay a few bucks extra for a pre assembled unit like the monoprice maker select	-1
EDIT #2:  Elizabeth from HICTOP e-mailed me asking me to remove this review or else she would be in danger of losing her job.  I am not new to 3D printing.  This actually was my 3rd printer.  It was the first printer I bought that was a complete waste of money from the start.  First of all despite following both the paper guide and the video on wiring the power supply, the first time I plugged it in the room filled with smoke and the power prongs partially melted (see photo).  Luckily my circuit breaker tripped or an electrical fire would have been likely.  I was able to repair this, but really I should have stopped here.  The problem was that both the video and the wiring guide in the instructions showed a slightly different power supply than the one I was sent  - the difference is in the faint metal engravings, otherwise it was identical, but by simply following the instructions I was given I nearly caused a fire as I wasn't expecting a different power supply than the one on the item list.  I should have checked it a bit closer, but both the video and the assembly instructions said to do it this way, so I did.  If they are sending out different power supplies now then those directions need to be updated ASAP.  Second, the screws I was sent for the fan guard > fan > heat sink > extruder (connecting to each other in that order) were too long, but had they been the right size, it wouldn't have mattered as the heat sink didn't have screw holes anyway.  I e-mailed Hictop about this and verbatim their response was "try to do it again and do it slower."  Oookay, thanks for nothing.  I go to Lowe's and get some proper screws and manage to assemble it.  I turn it on and my computer doesn't recognize it (Window's 10).  I download drivers, install a different version of Cura, try a different USB cable, nothing.  I've printed with an SD card before, I'll try it again just to get this calibrated.  Well, you have to unscrew the LCD screen to insert the SD card, since the mounts for the printer filament block it.  Lastly, I attempted to calibrate my printer and was met with a "Heating fail" message on the LCD screen.  Thank goodness for Amazon, because Hictop customer service won't back up their garbage-grade products.  Edit:  After posting this I received an e-mail from the seller.  They apologized for their first e-mail and then told me to attach all those parts by the "upper holes."  They only have lower holes.  Next step was to "install the fan with the label facing inside" followed by a screenshot of their instructions where it literally says "the sticker on the fan facing out."  I know English is not their first language, but this is lazy at best and dangerous at worse.	-1
This is beyond a bad printer. (I will update with photos soon.)  This is so badly designed it isn't even funny....  Once it is calibrated, it will be fine for a few hours until the board catches fire.  - I went through 2 boards, the first of which caught fire and the second stopped working after melting a connection. - A LOT of the acrylic WILL crack due to the way it goes together. - YOU CAN'T USE THE SD CARD. The SD Card has to be accessed to allow you to print anything, but with the filament holder, it totally covers the SD card slot... ANYONE who would have put it together would have noticed after 2 minutes. - The wingnuts are pointlessly hard to deal with, they can only be turned one way or the bed won't move, they get in the way which means you can't even level the bed. - You NEED to buy a plate of glass for the top. I got mine at home depot for $2, but you shouldn't have to. You literally can not print anything on here without it though, the bed actually warps so you can't get any even layers. - I have CONSTANT "mintemp" errors for no reasons, thermosistors work fine and yet the board will just throw out a heating failed error and not do anything until you reset it. - You have to wire a lose cable to the power supply which has a terrible cover over it. I had to buy a plug with a fuse and switch, and then print a cover just so I could turn it off and on without killing myself... and trust me. you WILL need to turn it off and on.. - No included instructions, it comes with a PDF on a CD... not many computers even have DVD drives any more, do they not get this? - Filiment constantly falls off of the spool and leads to failed prints. - BOARD WILL CATCH FIRE/SHORT IF THE FILAMENT MONITOR (a useless thing anyway) IS PLUGGED IN WRONG. EASILY DONE, THEY UPDATED THE INSTRUCTIONS AFTER I AND A FEW OTHERS EXPLAINED THIS.  Everything about this printer is bad. It took 2 days of modifications to get it to work right, and still doesn't work well. I would HIGHLY advise against it. I love tinkering, building, modifying and dealing with this sort of thing, but this had me pulling my hair out because so many of the problems just shouldn't have existed if a company spent more than 5 minutes dealing with its design, or even just put one together first... Save your money. Honestly, it is not worth the work.  Please note, I believe this "kit" is going through constant revisions, and the other "positive" reviews must be for a version that worked somewhat well. This one does not.	-1
EDIT*** This thing was a total waste of money. I even spent extra money to replace the parts the seller didn't include, and added extra parts and money to try to tweak it to work properly. I couldn't get a single print to work at all. Seller did nothing but refuse to help. Total waste of time and money.  So far, and maybe a fluke, but I've only just opened the shipping box to horrendous results. I've contact the seller and we are in the process of resolving the issues, but I thought it would be worth noting them here. I'll update review and post with new information and photos.  I received my package quickly using Prime, and all looked well. When I opened the Amazon shipping box I found another box inside that was opened already. The tape was cut carefully, but the box was just free to flap open. Thinking it was weird, I was planing to carefully inventory all the parts. When I went to unpack the box, I found all the parts inside flung around haphazardly. nothing packed in the foam inserts like I've seen photos of here from other reviewers. Literally, just a pile of stuff. I checked a few parts while I was writing an email to the seller. All threaded rods are shorter than parts list indicates. All rods, smooth and threaded, are bent (a good 1/8" in center across span). I'm disappointed, but I'm remaining hopeful that the seller can help. I had so many feels that I couldn't even get through the inventory. I need to respond to seller with photos, so i think I'll inventory and lay out all parts for group photo.	-1
This just proves that it's worth it to buy an original rather than a cheap knock-off. This hotend came with a non-working thermistor to start. The screw for the heater could not be loosened to remove the heater to use it in the volcano block. The volcano block also had burrs in it which made threading the nozzle in it impossible unless properly cleaned of the burrs.  Honestly, just do yourself a huge favor and buy the original E3D hotend and not this cheap knock-off. Save yourself times of time, trouble and a lot of headache.	-1
Takes way to much heat to completely melt the heat shrink ! You will end up with mostly burned wires.	-1
Takes a lot of heat to get these things to shrink down.  They are difficult to work with when using 16 gauge wire.  I had to double and tripple fold the wire before trying to stuff the bare end into these connectors.  Crimping was hard and the crimps failed about 40% of the time.  It would have been quicker and more secure just to twist the wires together by hand and use regular black heat shrink tubing.  These did nothing to make the connection more secure and they took more work and time to install.	-1
I am extremely disappointed with these.  When they first arrived, I was impressed... each comes in it's own very professional sleeve box, and then even boxed together as a set.  And the material seemed very professional and well crafted.  Ive read a lot about how these things won't even lie flat (warped). These are great in that regard.  But it boils down to what matters - the electrical connections and how firmly do they hold onto the components' legs.  So many (I mean many) false contacts, bad contacts, flakey contacts.  I am finally resorting to just creating my own home-made "solderless jumper board"  And I researched these a lot...  I hesitated spending even more money ...  and today not sure that would even matter.	-1
I like the idea of "starter" 3D printer at a significantly lower price than the bigger 3D printers aimed at adults or more experienced users. However, don't mistake this as a child's unit. It's much too complicated and has to be put together before it can be used.  In comparison to my CEL Robox 3D printer, this one is at best a toy and at worst absolutely useless. First off, you have to put it together - snapping the top on and the corner piece. Second, there is no cover over the printing bed - these things get seriously hot, little fingers can be burned without a protective cover. Third, the printing bed requires use of tape or your prints won't stick and some will collapse if things aren't"just right". My Robox machine has none of those issues - granted, it's not perfect, but it is a more finished product.   All 3D printers are persnickety to some degree. This one is more difficult and harder to just use than it should be. The filament is pricy and propriety. The software took three tries to download and actually be usable on a 1 year old laptop running Windows 10. It randomly throws errors or locks up. Honestly, I wanted to print the same two items (A Doctor Who Tardis) , but this machine locked up once and the second time nothing would stick to the bed. I got one clean Tardis from my 18 month old Robox. And therein is the reason that I won't even bother with this one again....who has time for frustration while doing cool stuff?	-1
Don't buy this printer if you plan to use 3rd party filament. The accompanied software is annoying with ads. I bought this printer from BH. It came with a cartridge of yellow ABS. XYZ cartridge only contains 0.6Kg of material. I bought a XYZ natural PLA filament 0.6Kg cartridge for $27; what a rip-off. The PLA cartridge talks with the software; its extruder temperature is 145C with platform at 45C. That's very low for PLA. The software that came with the printer, on a CD/DVD, keeps asking you you install update every time running it. As soon as you update, it will absolutely force you to create an account with XYZ and login before you can enter the application - you have no choice. Once you've created an account and login, it won't bother with asking to login again, but keeps popping up with notice of some other software offer FREE and not-so-free from XYZ, along with another pop up telling you 3rd party filament won't give you a good result. I had to drill the hood of the unit to accept other filament. See attached pictures. If you happened to run out of filament, good luck with trying to get the stuck filament out. The feeding motor is NOT at the extruder assembly. I had to totally disassemble the extruder to get at the filament. The 3D scanner is very poor in quality/resloution. You're better off buying a separate 3D scanner on Amazon. Bad design, annoying software, expensive proprietary filament cartridge, & low quality 3D scanner. This printer is slower than other brand printer in the same price range. No, I don't get discount or paid for review. Every dime I spent on tech comes from my paycheck.	-1
I purchased these due to the high reviews but every one I've done so far has come off.  I ended up getting a higher quality one and those are on there tight after crimping, these though, the crimp never lasted more than a month.  Too late to return them but will try and see if there is a better way for me to crimp these so they don't come off.  Very disappointing.	-1
This pH meter is very jumpy it cannot lock in it's always flipping numbers what a waste of money	-1
Didn't work once for me. After opening it, I followed the calibration steps, and now the unit is stuck at the same pH level for every liquid.  Doesn't matter what liquid I put the unit into.  I tried different things like taking the batteries out and recalibrating it multiple times.  For ~$21, save your money and buy another product instead of this one offered by Xpert Omatic.  The premise is great but the execution fell short, at least for me.  One other thing to point out is that the calibration steps require the use of enclosed PH solution powders which are sold by Health Metric and those cost ~$7 for a 3-pak.  At some point, you will run out of the ones provided and will need to purchase the powders.  This product appears to be similar to what the shaving and printing companies are doing, selling you a cheap tool and then charging for the added necessary accessories to make up for the low tool cost.  I'm not sure if Health Metric and Xpert Omatic are one and the same company but just something to consider when you're purchasing this item.	-1
Terrible product. Won't calibrate as per the included instructions or the website video (different instructions for each). The buffer powder wouldn't dissolve; even after an hour there were big chunks floating around. The display never would stabilize into a reading; it constantly jumped around. When I first opened the box there was a white powder all over the end of the meter and probe. I took the battery cover off and there was more white powder all over the place and inside of the pen on the circuit board. Absolute piece of trash.  If you are thinking of buying this meter I highly suggest you go watch their calibration video first. I would have never considered this meter if I had seen that ridiculous video first.  I use and calibrate ph meters on a daily basis and I would never recommend this junk. Save your time, money and frustration and look elsewhere. Luckily Amazon takes care of us when trash like this is sold to consumers with a no hassle prepaid return.	-1
I purchased this meter to test the pH of my newly found hobby of brewing kombucha. Apparently, keeping the ph at the right levels makes for a wonderful  carbonated kombucha. The meter is an attractive tool with its own carrying case for storing. I've never used a. Meter before, so relying totally on the instructions, which I diligently followed to the letter, I could not get the calibrated. It would work as expected, but next use, I'd have to do the whole calibration process again. I ran out of testing powder and gave up. Very disappointed, thought this was a great idea! I asked my CA pool certified hubby to look at this and he couldn't get it to hold the calibration from testing to next testing either. I purchased this to test and provide an honest  review from my personal use and experience.	-1
not sticky at all	-1
Package was not vacuum sealed and had the worlds smallest silica gel packet in it so it was full of moisture before I started printing. Spool does not match the picture and it was full of tangles right out of the packaging so I had to respool it. Feeds just fine at 245/60 temperature at 30mm/s print speed but is making a lot of popping and puffs of smoke from moisture and giving very inconsistent prints. Likely going in the trash.	-1
they are ok.  when you get these scientific tools you get them because precision matters.  I felt that even though the glass wouldnt be good quality at least the measurement would be correct.  I was wrong.  the glass doesnt seem to be too bad.  however the measurement is off.  by a lot.	-1
the first roll WAS GREAT...STRONGEST STUFF IVE TRIED YET!  PRINTED AT 255/72C LIKE A DREAM. IT WAS DEFINATELY WORTH THE PREMIUM FOR THAT ROLL. BUT THE SECOND ROLL WAS GARBAGE. THERE WAS A MIXUP IN LABELING AND I GOT A SUB QUALITY ROLL OF BLACK NYLON WITH A PURPLISH TINT TO IT THAT WAS HARD AS HELL TO GET DIALED IN ENOUGH TO ADHERE TO ITSELF AND THE RESULTS WERE FLIMSY, WEAK PRINTS THAT DELAMINATED AT EVERY LAYER FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.  WHEN BROUGHT TO THE SELLERS ATTENTION ...ALL I GOT WAS A REPLY ABOUT THE NEWER STYLE REELS THAT TAULAN CHANGED OVER TO AND NO MENTION OF THE MIXUP OR ANY EXPLANATION, NOR ANY OFFER TO CORRECT THE MISTAKE IN SENDING A MISLABELED PRODUCT AT A PREMIUM PRICE, SO I NEVER BOUGHT ANOTHER ROLL ON AMAZON AND WENT TO THE SOURCE.  AFTER A YEAR OF NO RESPONSES FROM THE SELLER FOR A RESOLUTION, I AM EDITING MY RATING AND REVIEW TO REFLECT THE FACTS. MY ADVICE IS IF YOU WANT GENUINE TAULMAN3D PRODUCTS...GO TO THE SOURCE.	-1
poor	-1
The fan works and is solid. However it has that made in China smell. I am uncertain if this will be safe to move air in my grow tent. I will leave it in the basement for a few days and see if it improves.	-1
These are not polished at all, you can still see the drill marks, they are polished on the outside but not on the inside. I took 2 pictures one at the hotend and one at the cold end, both show drill rings. I was being nice with my pictures and showed the better of the two heatbreaks, the other heatbreak in the package is even worse. I feel like this is false advertising either that or the manufacturer does not know what polished means. With an all metal hotend not to jam the inside needs to be a mirrored surface not riddled with rings for the filament to hang up on causing jams.	-1
It's a good thing I couldn't find a smaller package of these. I only need six and it took almost the entire package to get six that didn't just snap into pieces.  There are not enough letters in the word "garbage" to describe the degree to which these are garbage.  Honestly, I'd have thought this would be something that was impossible to foul up.  Never underestimate the power of people to find new ways to do things.  It almost restores my faith in humanity.	-1
After 2 days wasted trying numerous modifications, this upgrade will not work. Doesn't allow pinda probe to reach front row of sensors. Thanks for nothing and wasted time.	-1
bad	-1
The price is this only thing's saving grace. I plugged it into my computer and it worked. The resolution is low but what do you expect for a camera lens this small? The worst thing about this camera though is it is not waterproof at all. I dunked it into a glass of water and water pooled inside the plastic lens. The electronics seem to still work but the main problem now is the plastic is fogged up inside, making it nearly impossible to see anything on the screen. So the housing isn't watertight but somehow, at least for now, the internal mechanics seem to be water tolerant.  Don't buy this for use in a wet environment because it will not do you any good. However, as cheap as it is, its a fun little camera to play around with. I'm not going to return it, but I wouldn't  buy it again or recommend it.	-1
My crimps are failing left and right with these, switched to a higher quality one and don't have a problem.  Do yourself a favor and spend the extra for ones that will fully crimp and last.	-1
All the pics for this item show that the sensor has a metal probe, however the one I received has a plastic probe that looks like it would snap off just by looking at it.  Appears that they changed the design (but they need to update their pics and descriptions), I would not buy it had I of known.  Thankfully Amazon has a good return policy.	-1
Its pretty cool at first probing was accurate. Then died after about 60 days. At around 45 days the probe started failing to deploy occasionally then progressively got worse. I checked the wires voltage and firmware but could find no flaws. I think these wear out too fast. Now rewiring my D6 to get this junk out.	-1
They claim great support and there is none at all!	-1
This thing is the worst. It does not work, and I tried everything. My lerdge board supports it directly in firmware, I even got my oscilloscope out to make sure that the signals were correctly being sent to the device. They were, and it still did not work, the pin would never lower even though I was giving it the correct pulse train to lower the pin. Don't bother the documentation sucks, support sucks, and the company sucks. I would have loved it if it worked. I can't even get my money back because I had to modify the board (cut the trace to make it 3.3v compatible) still did not work. Please don't wast your time or money on this hunk of garbage. Plus Toms review said this is the least accurate homing device out there.	-1
I was taken in by all the marketing hype on this crappy sensor.  I have been trying to use two of them on two different printers and have been having nothing but trouble.  The are not consistent between probes and one I have jams and misreads if there is even a hint of dust on it.  I would return the ones I have if I could, but they are going into the trash and I'm going back to inductive sensors.	-1
I was told "this would work" as a replacement to one already installed so I bought it.  Hooked it all up.  When I powered it all up, it blew out my LCD screen.  The BLTouch that was originally installed on my Wombot printer worked great until the pin fell out of it.  Now, this replacement doesn't work either.	-1
If you think you get cheap junk for this price - surprise, you are correct. I ordered a set, replaced the nozzle and when loading filament, there is about a 0.5mm top of the nozzle that simply falls off, effectively making this a 2mm nozzle... It was not a single problem, I went through three out of the package with exactly the same results. Worst quality and 100% unusable.	-1
Not what they seem.. if your looking for a cheaper nozzle alternative for your mk10 style extruder these are unfortunately not the solution. Extruded width is too thick, closer to .5mm, and the threads are hit or miss on the claimed m7 size. Stick with nozzles from Micro Swiss and avoid th headaches.	-1
Bought used Amazon wearhouse deal. Did not work. When you power it on the screen is lit but blank.	-1
Got it for Christmas, it was on sale. The first printer broke about 36 days after we got it. The SD card slot stopped reading and even though there's a plug to plug it into the computer to print directly from the computer - it doesn't work. You NEED the SD card slot to work.  So, Amazon begrudgingly made a very super special exception and let me exchange it. Aside from the warming plate not getting even a little bit warm, and models not sticking, sliding all over, it worked well enough. This one lasted about 2 months before it wouldn't even turn on anymore. All of a sudden the power switch stopped working. So rather than go through Amazon because they made it such a hassle to get help the first time I talked to monoprice directly. I had to ship it back to them, have them repair it, send it back. The whole process took about a month.  I got it back today. They said the wiring in the warming plate was faulty and they replaced it. Now I'm trying to print and everything I print feels like it's glued down. I can't get anything off of the plate. Which wouldn't be SO bad if it was printing correctly. But it's not. It starts to print normally then shifts every model over about an inch. So, every single thing I print is completely useless.  Talking to amazon customer service now. They're blaming me. Saying this is the second time there has been an issue. and want to give me a refund on the sale price. Refusing to exchange it for a working one. Nice. So now I'm out a printer and I spent a bunch of money on all this filament.  This printer is garbage and so is Amazon's customer service. The last 3 times I spoke with (on chat or email, phone has been fine) them they've been rude, unhelpful, and accusatory. I have no idea what happened to their customer service but it's terrible. I may stick around for smaller things but any big purchases like this are going to have to start being made elsewhere. There's no guarantee of anything working and if it doesn't they tell you it's your fault. Ridiculous. The pictures speak for themselves. You're right Amazon. Clearly this is MY fault... The printer works "fine", right?  Stay away from this printer.	-1
people say this is a good intro to 3d printer.  I do agree but not because I think it's a solid little printer.  its a good learning tool because this printer is just so unforgiving and will force the user to research problems.  so that in itself is not a  bad thing..  but the hotend is cheap, the build area is small, the build plate is warped, severe z banding issues, etc, etc, etc..	-1
Very disappointed with this 3D printer the second one I have had in two months both had the same problem the build platform ,it quit heating and will not work now	-1
For a small price, this printer did very well for a while. Then the filament backups happened, crawling up the print head and cooking the insulation and wiring. Looking for help on YouTube, the head replacement is a GIANT pain. To add an better nozzle involves re-wiring and taking apart the WHOLE thing. The WiFi never did work, and the usb connector fails to update a win 10 driver. Worst, it will ONLY see the sd card it came with. No amount of trying to copy it to a bigger card will work, due to some unknown file system on it. I may be able to fix it in the future, but it is clearly a limited use printer.	-1
Monoprice printers are cheap in both sense - money and quality. Stay away from this brand. If you run into trouble with the printer, good luck dealing with their customer care.	-1
This is my second MP Select Mini 3D printer this year. A very good one in March and this one which is VERY BAD. Number one mini has used about two Kg of filament since getting it setup and printing mainly from USB or WiFi. Any issues I've had with it (setting up WiFi) I have found fixes for on the internet / you tube. The new one has a much nicer LCD and user interface and I didn't need to print  a new control knob. (see early reviews of this printer) THE GARBAGE! 1. The simple G-code file used to setup WiFi has been replaced with an APP for your iPhone (which I don't have) so I can't setup WiFi printing. 2. The USB will not communicate with either of the two computer w/CURA I use to print from with my first Mini. 3. I do not consider printing from SD card an only option. The new printer has the same outstanding print quality and ease of operation as my first Mini but without WiFi or USB connectivity the Grand Kids Christmas will be without a cute, ready to use 3D printer. I will not wast time talking to a CS rep to fix problems the never should have gotten past quality control before shipping. RETURNED	-1

This printer is so picky about what SD card you use. once you finish a print there is an option to pint another if you click that it will home then go up about 20mm then start to print mid air and totally just ram itself into the side of the printer messing up the motors as shown in the video. Other times it will just sit there and do nothing when you load a file and tell it to print. I thought this was a good printer but I guess not. Sadly I will be sending the printer back as i know their support sucks. DO NOT GET THIS PRINTER!	-1
junk	-1
Oh yeah the LCD display is scratched too! As soon as it will let me load my pictures I will.  So after spending 9 hours learning about this printer, what all was broken and how to refurbish it i was finally able to print something.  As for the printer.  It's a solid piece of equipment. This thing took a beating to get to me. I'm surprised it works at all. Ive had it print all the missing and broken pieces and I feel like it is worth the money.  That being said I don't have any thing good to say about the company that sent it to me. They took no time to ensure that the item was properly package. The printer was literally metal to cardboard and took so many hits the box was torn apart and the printer was about to fall out.  You may want to buy from the company verses through Amazon for this. I have bought many things through them and never had a problem, but this has made me rethink where and who I use in the future on purchases like this.	-1
Unfortunately, I have had to change my mind on this one:  This printer is impressive.  It works straight out of the box.  There is a great, helpful community out there that will gladly help you get it up and running and working great.  it prints beautifully when it works, which is the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of one.  The problems start when things start to break.  Monoprice does not have/sell replacement parts for it, so you have to look elsewhere.  BUT THEY HAVE  A ONE YEAR GUARANTEE!!!  That looks amazing in writing, but in practice, if you buy from amazon instead of from their website, they treat you like a second-rate customer.  I have been waiting for weeks now to have my printer replaced, and keep getting told they don't have any in stock, which is an outright lie on their part.  I know, and have seen proof, of people in these same printer groups on facebook that have RMAed printers after mine, and already gotten replacements.  That's simply not acceptable.  If you're going to offer a guarantee, and highlight it in your sale thread, you should definitely back that up.  I'm really dissapointed in this, because up until I had to deal with the RMA and their service department I had a good opinion of their company.  Now, I would not buy from them again, and I highly recommend that even after reading this review if you're going to buy this printer, buy it from their site not amazon.  That's simply not ok with me.	-1
Hotend was burnt and has dried filiment all over it. Gantry is bent. The bed has a huge scratch where the nozzle dug into it. It was missing sample pla as well as SD card.	-1
Update Monoprice replacement warranty is a lie. They don't have the priner in stock for two months and would not replace it with another model. waited for printer to be in stock and missed Amazon return window. They have changes ETA several times since April on their website.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER. IT IS $220 GAMBLE.  -------- The has many issues - prints don't stick because I got a plate warped in middle and I have been printing with a raft mostly in a corner part for straight prints. The printer stops at random before completing and no way to restart from where it left. It has wasted a lot of filament when I leFt it unattended on a print and just made a big jjngle of filament. It doesn't retract filament correctly hence always has an extra line or a missing line. Monprice cistomer service is worst - asked me to wait till it is in stock and changed date twice. Refused a paid upgrade. Will probably return it to Amazon for refund.	-1
Had to replace many components, beginning with failed controller, then bearings, rails, hot-end, etc. Not finished yet. US seller failed to be helpful (IMO) apart from offer of refund if I returned  the whole machine (not practical). Asian factory was helpful re partial schematic.	-1
This printer is a bargain for what it sells for and for the hour or so it worked it was awesome. Unfortunately that about as long as it lasted, the Y axis began to shake and make noise and started laying down layers all over the place. It appears one of the linear bearings in on the y axis bound up requiring replacement. Looking into it on the internet it appears it's a known problem. I've returned the printer and willl order something else. Too bad because I really like the design and the size. Oh well!	-1
I bought 4 these printers... every single one of them had issues the very first printer I ordered worked great for about a week and then the trouble started happening vibrating failure to feed xcetera... I would say if you are going to buy this print a lot in the first couple of weeks that you have it if you get a good one you will know if you get a bad one the problems will start occurring and hopefully be able to return it for a replacement	-1
I revised my review. At first I loved this thing. Then 6 months into owning it the wire for the bed heater broke and the thermistor for the bad went bad as well. I contacted monprice and it took them 5 days to respond. In that amount of time I ordered the materials to do the mod that others have done to avoid future breakage. So. 6 months in expect to do repairs. Monoprice will send you a new one, provided you don't void the warranty like I did. But why would you want a printer that is going to break again? If you have this, mod it. You will save some down time. As for monoprice their customer service just plain sucks.	-1
Less than a year. Keep fixing, but it just keeps breaking	-1
I was so excited to get my first 3D printer I could hardly wait! My heart sank when I opened the outer box and saw that the inner box had already been opened and had the flaps folded in as whoever repackaged it could not be bothered to tape it shut. I went ahead with removing the printer and begin setting it up per the instructions. Once I began the bed leveling procedure I saw why this might have been a returned unit as the bed was so warped that it would be impossible to level seeing how the center was so bowed in. I spent an hour trying to level the four corners and each time finding that it was so off in the center you could fit 3-4 sheets of paper thickness between the extruder nozzle and the bed. The aluminum bed is very thin and I can see this being a real issue for folks as it will easily bend and warp trying to pry off prints. I knew at this time I would have to return it. I decided to play around with the menu before I packaged it back up just to get a feel for the machine and that's when I found other issues that could have contributed to the return of this unit. For one, the bed would not stop at the outer right Y axis movement causing loud thuds as it reach the outer limit. This is not good. The second issue for this unit is a not functional micro sd card reader. It would not read the card at all. I took the card to my laptop and it was fine. i was able to read all the contents but the printer would not read it at all. Another issue was filament stuck in the extruder feed and nozzle from a previous use that would have required me to disassemble the hot end to clear out. An issue I discovered that I think affects all units has to do with the selection wheel. You have to press in on the wheel to make selections, but almost every time I tried to do this it would change the selection to the next item as it clicked causing unwanted items to be selected. This is very annoying. The color menus are very nice and easily readable so that's a big plus. I wish more printers had menus this nice. The packaging was adequate as it was triple boxed and the unit itself in-cased in styrofoam to protect it. As others mentioned mine came with a small coil of white filament, an allen key, micro sd card, and a plastic scraper. A big disappointment for me as I had already bought several rolls of filament and designed a few items in sketchup that I was excited to print but now I have to wait on the return process and refund to purchase a different unit. I am going to step out on a limb and buy one of the kits here on Amazon and build it myself. I think it will allow me to have a better understanding of how to maintain and upgrade the unit.	-1
As a note, I should of checked my 2020 dimension prior to buying these, but even these are labeled as "2020 drop in" they are not drop in for my brand of 2020 extrusions (which are 8020 brand), 8020's 2020 slots are roughly 5.08mm in length, these t-nuts being 6mm for their neck, won't drop into the lot post assembly. They will drop in through the top/bottom of the extrusions pre-assembly, but still are wider, so won't turn to "grab" inside the extrusion either.	-1
Incorrect description states that this will test water hardness and it will NOT	-1
Would not come on	-1
i cheaped out. i shouldn't have. this tape is nowhere near as sticky as 3M tape and is too narrow to be useful. guess the kids can use it for box forts- not for serious HVAC use IMO	-1
UPDATE: Defective after 4 months and Seller Witbot will do nothing.  I ordered the V1.4 on Dec 17, 2016 and I actually received a V1.5.  Obviously, I can't promise you'll have the same luck but I was very happy.  It has the same footprint and some new protections you can google to read about.  I love that this has everything I need for my Prusa i3 integrated into one board.  So far I've done several small prints and one 16 hour print and have not had a single problem from this board.  Bought this to replace a V1.4 that I fried with loose 12V wire that ended up sending 12V through the USB port.  Also fried my LCD controller at the same time.  I was happy with the V1.4 which is why I went for the exact replacement.	-1
Actually I don't know how good or bad the tape itself is as I have not been able to get the plastic wrap off the individual rolls.	-1
Doesn't Stick Well	-1
It came cracked and the plastic is extremely cheap. It's no wonder camera broke.	-1
I give up with this thing. Won't calibrate right, constantly searching for the reading. Just terrible. Maybe I got a bad one, but this thing is useless.	-1
Sorry, not sure why this is a top seller, after a week and having to recalibrate over and over the meter started to read 0000, and didn't work. I take great care of my equipment, but I eventually had to buy a more expensive PH reader 19.99, and had to return this one. When using just know you may have to be super delicate with this one. Maybe mine was just defective I don't know.	-1
I just got this and found calibration was way off right out of the box. I went through the calibration process several times and every time I powered it off and back on it lost calibration. Im sending it back.	-1
Would not calabrate, made many attempts before giving up and buying a real one for $35. Don't be cheap like me it had a swing of 2 not .2 but 2 I put in buffer it shows right turn off back on showing 9 and still climbing	-1
Did I say these are cheap quality, they leak and fail very rapidly. Was using a gentle mix of Baby Shampoo and Water for some 3m Cover and after just a few pumps it started to leak, figured maybe I didn't tighten properly. I took pump off, wiped all down and closed up - no spray at all. repeated and it leaked profusely.	-1
Plastic bottle tops are brittle, and tend to break within 30 minutes of use with only water in the bottles.	-1
Terrible for "PROFESSIONAL" use. I run a business dismantling motorcycles. We use spray bottles for cleaning, usually just filled with degreaser. These feel fine and pump fine, but two of the three broke in the first week of use. The top of the clear bottle just cracked right off or split so you can't use them. They are worse durability than the el cheapo dollar store ones. We bought https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Z86FRPO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s03?ie=UTF8&psc=1 at the same time and none have broken. They're much better.	-1
How many people do you know who have overhead exposed steel beams and girders in their house or place of business?  Then these magnets are for them.  I read another reviewer's post, and I suppose that is how he is using these magnets, but I'll dare to say most people are not attaching their magnets horizontally on an overhead steel beam.  That being said, I did a few tests of my own.  I took a 25lb weight and tried it with one magnet.  Nope.  How about 2 magnets?  Nah.  3 magnets?  No.  4 magnets?  What do you think?  I then when down to a 10lb weight to see if it would stay on the side of a steel locker.  Well, the magnet slid almost 2 the floor, but it did keep the 10lb weight from tipping over and pulling off the strap, once the weight reached the floor.  I did guide the weight and strap with my hand, or the whole thing would have come off the locker.  See photos.  I understand physics a bit.  I get the difference between holding a vertical load and a horizontal load.  I will try it sometime with a horizontal load of 25lbs sometime when I figure out an application for using these hooks for a horizontal load--and I have a horizontal magnetic surface handy.  I suppose if someone had a shop light hooked to an engine hoist / cherry picker and the arm was pretty much horizontal, they could attach a work light in a horizontal fashion and hold it and the hooks in place with these magnets.  I'm not saying they don't work, I'm just saying the advertisement should be more clear about the way the magnets hold a load.  That being said, they are nice looking magnets, and I bought them to hold my keys and carabiners on the side of the fridge.  I also wanted to be able to move them around whenever I wanted.  I wanted these magnets to hold a little bit of weight, but not a huge amount, so they do that.  So, a little more truth in advertising would be nice.  I know it's the seller's job to sell magnets.  I will also do more careful research in the future with my important magnet purchases.  Buy them--just don't expect them to hold much more than your smaller items vertically--and certainly not 25lbs vertically.  I'll report back once I conclude my horizontal experiments, if I can ever think of something practical...  *** UPDATE 9/23/16  ****  I cleaned out a locker, and I TRIED to hang just a 10lb weight from the hook attached horizontally so the magnet had the entire surface of the shelf that is horizontal in the locker from which to draw.  Not even close to holding my 10lb weight.  So, I'm calling a "mythbusting" official BS on these magnets.  Not that anyone else needs to care, but it makes me feel better, lol.  I was skeptical originally that a magnetic surface about the size of a penny could hold 25lbs.  I knew this was something I had to see for myself.  Anyway...these magnets will do a nice job holding my keys on the side of the fridge.  That they will hold...	-1

Poor quality, do not last consumed all 10 in less than 15 minutes cutting open  a hot water tank on circumference. about 20" diameter of  3/32 mild steel.	-1
I've had problems with this replica since I've started using it, filament getting clogged, leaking out of the heat break even when it was properly assembled with the nozzle tightened against it, and the PTFE hose all the way down to the heat break. My original jhead didn't had these issues.  UPDATE 2017/4/23: I've still been using this hot end despite a few problems I've had. It's been almost 3 months using it, and as of this week the fan went out (made grinding noises, then stopped) so I had to replace the fan. Even before replacing the fan, to using the new fan, the fan is not cooling down the heatsink at all. Each part of the hot end is at their proper locations and tight. Because of this, there is now filament leaking out of the nozzle when its warming up.	-1
I like the design, it probably works but the one I received was too banged up for me to be happy. The housing for the little fan was cracked and prevents it from turning. The barrel was bent between the bottom of the heat sink and the aluminum block.  I tried contacting the company, asking them if would just let me trade my broken fan for a new one: no response.  I used my own dang fan for a while to ameliorate the constant jams to which this barrel is subject and it worked fine... until the barrel snapped at the bent spot. I drilled the broken barrel out, threaded in a spare I happened to have and continued printing that night, but first I ordered a better extruder barrel:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/RepRapDiscount-Hexagon-Full-Metal-Hot-End-Hotend-1-75mm-4mm-nozzle/dp/B00W8FL5BS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">RepRapDiscount, Hexagon Full Metal Hot End, Hotend, 1.75mm, .4mm nozzle</a>	-1
This didn't have a way of hooking up the PTFE tubing.	-1
Not terrible, but this shouldnt have a 3.5 star average. This is definitely not a v6 clone, maybe a v5-lite. Lite since mine shipped with a teflon tube extending into the heater block. V5 rather than 6 because it has a 6mm thread on the heatbreak instead of than 7mm as designed. Unless there are multiple type getting shipped when you order this same part (and there's a good chance of that) there's no way you can print above 230. This is fine for a lot of people, I've bought two and one works well for PLA.

Mine came with a PTFE liner in the heat break, despite the product description saying they are "all metal stainless heat break".  There are reviewers saying theirs were all metal, but it appears to be a crap shoot what you are going to get.  Mine also came with a large threaded bowden connector on top instead of the direct connect shown in the product pictures.  This results in the total height being about 10mm taller than a real E3D V6, making it difficult to use as a drop in replacement.  The individual components look decent enough, but mine came pre-assembled and very poorly so. The thermistor sleeves were not seated properly, leaving exposed wire touching the heat block causing a short.  The nozzle was also screwed flush to the heat block leaving the heat break too loose.  The people assembling these things don't seem to know how to do it.  Overall, pretty disappointed.	-1
haven't  used it as yet but will update if anything arises with it s use.  Did not come with the tube and fitting but that is probably why it is priced like it is.  If you look around I'm sure you can find one complete for the same price point. I wouldn't say "I don't like it " as the 2 star designates but below is a response I wanted to send back to the seller: Just a note for your information.  I finally got around to installing on my unit [Metal J-Head V6 Hot End for RepRap 3D Printer 1.75mm ] and much to my disappointment, it did not work.  It returned a "MAX_TEMP_ERROR" and would go no further.  With further examination it read "0 Ohms resisance" across the thermister resulting in the error code. It looks as if the thermocouple was shorted out causing the problem.  Your supplier should excersise more caution while installing the theremocouple and avoid the problem.	-1
Filament bore was not drilled straight and did not line up with threaded throat. Could not pass filament through. Nozzle, heat block, threaded throat and fan assembly looked fine though.  Returned and reordered.	-1
Turd, never worked.	-1
I'm 51 years old with much experience in the wine and growing industry.  Ph meters have always been a very important tool for me, and they must be accurate to be useful.  With all the earnestness at my command and other meters on hand to verify this one, I found it impossible to calibrate this meter following the instructions to a T.  One helpful improvement would be more meticulous instructions which mention leaving the meter in the buffer solution until the reading is steady before pushing the calibration button, BUT on my particular meter it could not even get a steady reading before the power on it actually turned off from inactivity...not nice.  I have it finally working a little bit, but it isn't accurate enough to be useful for anything that needs to be within plus or minus .5 ph.  It's sad because more than anything I wanted to get this thing to work and write a positive review.  Bought another meter (yellow in color) with a screw to adjust it in the buffer solution and it was a breeze to set up.  ALSO, the buffer solutions to calibrate this particular meter will ONLY work accurately if you have the buffer solutions at 25C because the meter locks in that value for all three buffer solutions, no matter what the actual temperature and ph of the solution is.  Keep this in mind if you need accuracy, and I hope other people will have a meter which functions properly.  Mine just does not.	-1
Tool did not calibrate. I understand how these work and have a little clean lab space, lab tools and glassware. I appears to only accept the first solution but never the second. Rebooted by removing batteries several times and tried to recalibrate. Nope. Does not work.	-1

I will stick to brass after this. I run 8 3d printers and these steel nozzles seem to peel the first layer as its laying it. oddly none of my brass nozzles do this. I have been printing professionally for 4 years and this is the first and last time i try any steel nozzles.	-1

Stopped working in less than a year.  Was the most unreliable "top of the line" rechargeable toothbrush I've ever owned.	-1
I purchased this toothbrush for over  $219 on Amazon.  I found the exact same model on Amazon for $100 less today (11-28-16).  I initially gave this toothbrush a great review.  However, I'm tired of playing the price game!  Too much money for what it does.  I have several lower end Sonicares that do the job just fine!  Save your money.	-1
it this product  had the other half included then it would be worth  having	-1
UGH. Junk Junk Junk	-1
These things were advertised by amazon as a suggested ad-on for 2 part epoxy and they wouldn't uptake the epoxy....it was too thick even immediately after mixing! Total waste of money.	-1
My spouse picked this up on his Amazon account. We put it back in the fridge after use, and the next time we went to use it, the pointed dunce cap is glued shot. Now your hand will slide to the top when trying to pull it off. We managed to get it off after 10 minutes.	-1
This tape is strong. The adhesive is not rendering this tape almist useless. Strong tape is nothing is it doesn't stick to anything.  I was very hopefull, only to be supremely disappointed.	-1
NEVER, EVER WASTE your money on this junk.  I have never told anyone not to buy a product, until now.  I always tell people my experience with a product and let them decide if it works for them.  This stuff is so bad, so a POS that I have to tell you, don't buy it.  Why? Because it does not work. You think it's working, and then you come back and it's unstuck it self from the thing you stuck it on. This is 100% absolutely true if it's wrapped around something or the thing has curves, (ie anything not flat) and anything that moves.  A broom handle? Unwinds itself. A tarp, slides on the tarp after a few days. A bucket? Unwinds itself off the bucket. A rod I had to roll a few layers on to reinforce it. It totally unrolls itself till it's just stick along the edge of the rod.  It touts itself as a replacement for duct tape. Forget it. Duct tap moves. It stays stuck. This junk has a gummy, not permanent adhesive that just "melts" in place. Frankly, I don't know how they keep the thing on a roll. Everything I stick it to, it just unsticks itself.	-1
New twist on traditional duct tape. Thick cross fibers need to be cut with  a sharp razor blade,so it cannot be torn like duct tape. On top of that the adhesive gums up the blade quickly, so for friggin get about using scissors on this stuff. Yes its strong but it is a huge pain to work with.	-1
You cannot tear this tape that is true. A small knife is included to help you cut the tape off of the roll. If the adhesive was as strong as the tape on the roll that would be great. I taped a box that we had to send and the tape held, but when I used it to hold a torn piece of metal near an air duct for a temporary repair it loosened. There are fibers in the tape, but the adhesive is not ultra-tough.	-1
So basically, this tape is just a strip of plastic, which is why it can't be torn and needs to be cut with a razor blade. There's a cute little razor blade cutter included, which tucks into a pocket inside the roll itself. This scenario seems like an accident waiting to happen, and I'm not at all fond of it.  The tape itself is mediocre at best. Ok, so it can't be torn. Big deal! The adhesive itself is barely any better than standard duct tape, which isn't saying much.  Both are solidly inferior.  If you're looking for super strong adhesive tape, try Gorilla Glue Tape or U-Glue Fabric tape. The former is affordable, the latter is super expensive, however, they're literally like a super sticky glue in tape form, yet still can be removed (usually with ease) if needed.  Not impressed with this one.	-1
Most of the bearings were defective	-1
Count on 50% of the bearings to be bad out of the box.  Sizing is pretty consistent. I put these on a 3d printer and they started squeaking/groaning after about a week.  Lubed the shafts and they quieted down so I suspect the bearings are failing at an incredibly rapid rate.	-1

All five of these idlers are out-of-round. As a result they're unsuitable for use on a 3D printer. Not worth the cost to return.	-1
I've altered my original review after running almost a half roll of this material. Love the color but like others have reported the layer adhersion is just plain terrible!! I've altered temperatures and speeds which helped somewhat when I ran this material at 215C but I'll never buy this brand again. One of the worst PLA filaments I've come across. I saved a few bucks but it's just not worth it. For once the negative reviews were pretty accurate	-1
One coupler was perfect and works great. The other has a bore that is off center and is therefore useless so I only get to use half of the product I paid for.	-1
1. Cheap plastic print plate where 3D print PINK filament supplied by MOD-t stuck, broke and cannot clean it by scraping tools and last option was to chisel it to destroy plastic plate. ... 30 minutes 2. False claim - MOD-t can print using standalone, one has to UPLOAD *.STL files on internet for the print to start 3. Security ? Hard work to design must be uploaded on INTERNET on MOD-t database, why? 4. Ties up computer and INTERNET link from morning 10 AM to night 11 pm for a small object of 4x5x1" tray 5. Use scrapers) and almost scrapped my finger skin 6. Pink debris all over the floor from scraping - requires vacuum 7. Spool HOLDER is custom  - where I could NOT LOAD "SMARTBUY 3D FILAMENT" from Amazon - Smartbuy 1.75mm Primary Transparent PLA 3D Printer Filament - 1kg Spool / Roll (2.2 lbs) - Dimensional Accuracy +/- 0.05mm, Sold by: Smartbuy-depot, $19.95/kg  compared to $30 fro 600 grams (Double the cost) 8. Of course not suitable for ABS 9. Plastic print plate warped in it the very first print with automatic temperature as per software	-1
Was DOA. These things happen. I wasn't in the mood to troubleshoot a brand new device I purchased for mostly troubleshooting other devices / cabling issues, so returning for a replacement.  Will hopefully update with more stars a proper review.	-1
the measuring writing wipes off with ease had to fix with a clear coat of fingernail polish	-1
Your page for this product is buggy - when first shown, it has a line in the description: "For range hoods, appliances: to fit 7/16" x 1" opening".  If you click a different option and then click the "Standard" option again, that line in the description is no longer present.  So, the product you order when you just navigate to this page and click "Add to Cart" is described as:  Heavy-Duty rocker switches that fit .830 x 1.45 inch panel cutouts *** For range hoods, appliances: to fit 7/16" x 1" opening  The actual switch is YUUUUGE (.830 x 1.45), and certainly not what I believed I was buying.  I looked through the comments after not getting what I believed I was ordering, and others reported getting big honking rocker switch when they thought they would receive the 7/16"x1" model.  What say you fix the page for this product?	-1
Not sure what it fits? I have two versatile staple guns and this ammo is not for any of them.	-1
Why Bother With Reviews, Amazon deletes the truth when it hurts.	-1
It feels slimy and cleanup was messy.	-1
cheap P.O.S.	-1
These wheels are way too light duty, small axle and no bearing, for their rated weight. Sorry I bought them. The do LOOK good tho...	-1
I have had this a couple of yrs, and needed to use it recently. I had forgotten that one characteristic of this box is if you open all of the switches, you get a dead short (which I suppose is OK if you are not selecting a load resistor like I was).  At any rate, when I opened the box to check, I noticed the binding posts were very corroded to the terminal board. Not good. Thing is, I am not sure how the corrosion could have occurred unless it was stored in a wet environment, which it was not since purchase.	-1
Although labeled Antique White, it appeared like plain white to me.	-1
Got almond, but not realy almond.  More like a light cream color.	-1
Real cheasy, threads vary tops are not uniform. AND the paint chips off if you just look at it.	-1
Mine was not having any events	-1
open brand 'new' sealed bottle and all that came out was a fine powder.  Not a single drop of glue in it.  Vendor is unloading massively out-of-date stock.  What a scam Amazoid has become - ZERO quality control or screening of fraudsters.	-1
Well, the directions said that it was only good up to 200 degrees. I wish the web description said that because i wanted to repair a favorite coffee cup. Tried it anyway. Never got to test the application with hot coffee because after over a week, it is still tacky. I have used epoxy before and never had that problem. I would not buy this brand again	-1
Don't stick very well. I have purchased much better ones at Menards.	-1
Does not stick well at all.	-1
Did not fit 1/2 inch pvc pipe	-1
They wear out more quickly than generic blades. Definitely won't buy again	-1
Not impressed. First of all, it doesn't come with any kind of "spout" or applicator where the nozzle can be cut down to apply a small bead of glue. Your only option is the size of glue bead that comes directly from under the cap, which is large. Did not suit my purpose at all, and it ended up being a big mess.  Second, the setup time is really quick. Work in small areas with this stuff or it will be setup before you can smooth out the bead.  It smells like silicone, and my guess it is nothing but a fast-set silicone. I will not use again.	-1
Never breaks the pins where it should, poorly grips them and often they slide in the jaws instead of popping. Very displeased.	-1
Dreadfully diluted. Really guys?	-1
Looks OK if I don't look  too closely. The head leaks all over. This is not an Omron stethoscope. It is a non-functioning counterfeit.	-1
Complete junk.  I needed only two of these nuts but bought the box, figuring that I would just hang onto them in case I needed them in the future--NOT HAPPENING.  These things are complete garbage.  The plastic lock rings spin free and then push out of the of the crimped metal area.  Also, the nuts I received contained a very cheap clear plastic lock ring, not the denser white plastic shown in the photo (that I consider pretty standard for lock nuts). These things work OK as standard, non-locking, nuts but are completely useless as lock nuts.  I suppose that if you can manage to tighten one of these nuts down without the plastic ring popping out, it would presumably prevent the nut from backing off, but who knows.  I would have sent these things back but it's not worth the effort.  I threw the remainder of the box in the trash.  I retapped my brackets so that I could use an easier to find screw and nut and bought new lock nuts at my local hardware store.  This is getting to be ridiculous in that you can't buy anything on Amazon anymore without getting a completely useless piece of junk.  I have begun seriously limiting myself on what I order from Amazon because you just can't trust the 3rd party sellers.  They want to sell complete garbage.  I understand that you get what you pay for, but a locking nut?  Seriously?  You are so cheap that can't even put a decent piece of plastic in there?  VERY DISAPPOINTED	-1
It is easy to apply... however it shrinks something terrible. IMO DAP is better for latex caulk.	-1
The first 4" of the "factory" edge of the 24" piece had a slight bend in it.	-1
The inside diameter is smaller than advertised, which makes it worthless for my current needs, but it is very very strong and has square cuts.	-1
Of all the accessories that are offered with. The various SinkMate accessory kits, this hook is about the least interesting. I can drape a rag over it, and that just about says it all. Thing is, I primarily use sponges in my sink, and I keep my dry towels over a cabinet door bar. On the occasion I wet a rag, after rinsing and wringing I typically fold it over the center divider to dry further. Now I have the option to bunch it up and put it in the hook.  Installation is easy. The strip used on the back of the sink is a seventeen inch strip of magnetic plates that gets covered over with a twenty-one inch strip of sticky foil tape.  The hook is thin, flat and cheap. It could scrape something with a bit of bad luck. The hook is easily removable, and the magnetic backing is a rounded button-like shape that will not scratch.  The instructions indicate not to put the hook in the dishwasher. My guess is that the extreme heat could separate the magnetic button from the hook, but it's light enough such that it could probly get thrown around during the wash with undesirable results.  Life would have been no more difficult had I left this for someone else to review. I suppose I'm drawn to shiny things.	-1
a little oversized for most terminal blocks.	-1
The male and female threads are machined well, and with some pipe joint compound, there were no leaks.  However, the hex portion of the fitting was cast sloppily. It's not an exact standard or metric size. You may need an adjustable/crescent wrench to tighten this properly.	-1
My package contained compression springs only. there was no extension or torsion springs as advertised. However it was a nice selection of compression springs.  product not as pictured i was looking for assorted springs shame on you amazon	-1
Mostly small compression spring that are supposed to be medium sized. Bought 2 boxes and think I only got 3 tension type springs. SMH	-1
It is supposed to be a 36" length of neoprene sheet but it is so tightly rolled that only 33" was usable. I clamped the sheet between two boards for 48 hours and still the last 3 inches were not flat.  I also found that with neoprene contact cement this material would curl in both directions which also made it more difficult to get into position. This is specific to the way this sheet material was formulated as I have never had this problem in the past with many other rubber sheet products. Tough to get it into position when it curls up so terribly.	-1
11 7/8 x 11 7/8... if you are advertising it's 12" then make it 12"	-1
I bought 4 of these and they both cracked and broke with the first use. I'd give this negative stars if possible. Save your money.	-1
2 things: the clamp does not have a bar to tight it, bad design, also the balls loose and keep turning, bad design again Honestly, for a vise this small, $30-$35 would be reasonable	-1
Does not fit any of these RDAs:  Alliance V1, V2, Big Boy, Big Boy V2 Kennedy V4 VCMT Velocity	-1
Heaven forbid these were actually used in a surgery. Even though they're from a company named Hobby Tool Supply, likely indicating these are meant for consumer use, one broke trying to get it open. Quality that screams Made in China.	-1
Works but are not the best calipers. These are loose and catchy. Cheaply made and I admit it is reflected in the price. I would recommend buying a more expensive, better built set.	-1
Not the length that I thought they were and so wasn't able to use them.	-1
It's thin and it doesn't stick well. If you buy this you will have to use two layers of it, after carefully aligning the pattern.  This thing comes off easily. I haven't tried sealing  it to the surface using a heat gun; maybe that's what it'll take. Buy something else!	-1
Junk. Fell apart in just a few minutes of use.	-1
I needed a half gallon to do my porch. Bought 2 quarts and painted away. Severely different shades one end was light other end was dark. Had to buy a gallon and repaint it so now im down 3x the cost and i wasted a half gallon thats left over.	-1
The price is right, but the markings are impossible to read. The markings are so faint, and similar. Also, it is obviously intended for primarily metric use.	-1
Have been using it for several months now.  Only one issue.  The bowl leaks.  No matter how much I fill it, it leaks from between the bowl and the lid.  They should have included a rubber seal for the lid.  I resolved it with buying a new innertube (tire shops wouldn't sell used on to me) and cutting a rubber circle out of it.  You can usually get several out of one tube.  Now it does not leak unless I don't wipe it down. Update: It is now May and it has stopped working.  Web page links do not work.  Not sure we can even get warrantee since it was sold by AMAZON.	-1
This product is a great idea but needs to go back to Quikrete R & D as it is not ready to sell to the public yet.  Results DO look great as customer reviews have stated but after two months big patches simply "lift off" the floor revealing the ugly garage floor underneath.  We followed the instructions to the "T", watched the handy video, was pleased with the results until two months later.  I will have to resurface in the spring, probably with a good paint that is a light gray color.  $150 for my double garage is TOO MUCH for a product that does not work.  To any who are excited over their initial results with this product I say write your review AFTER it has been down on the floor for awhile.	-1
It doesn't help to have a digital watch on the head of a stethoscope you can't hear anything with.  Kinda defeats the purpose.  Wish I could put this clock on the stethoscope I can actually hear heart tones with.	-1
much too small for oils as it was stated.	-1
Expensive....  pretty much just collects the snow that ALREADY FORMS from releasing CO2 gas ----  metal tube is also rigid (not flexible hose!).  Pretty lame!	-1
Too small, unsafe for any practical wire rope application.  Shown in the picture is the wire rope I am replacing, and the size ferrules and thimbles I expected to receive.  The new cable is the same size as the old, 1/8" coated to 3/32".  The hardware from amazon is shown still in the package, too much of a time waster to even bother opening the package.  No way is the hardware I received from amazon going to be safe for this application.	-1
These cost a fortune compared to other wheels, and not all the Gladiator cabinets have the wholes for them to mount to. Geeze, if I had to drill holes and monkey around to make them fit "what they are suppose to fit", I would of bought lesser priced wheels from a different vendor. Hey Gladiator, why don't you make these mountable to the 72x36 inch cabinet. And why the heck don't you have a list of what products they actually go on.	-1
I don't like the taste at all. Can't speak to its stain removing abilities since I find myself reaching for alternatives with more tolerable taste.	-1
Not the quality you can relied on!  The crimp material is made of inadequate material SOFT ALUMINUM.  After the crimp, in 2 places on each side, the wire is not held secure, I pulled it out with little effort. This goes for all of these items I am reviewing.  When I was first hired after college, the guy I was assigned to sat me down with a pair of crimpers and 500 wires, for 18 gauge to 12 gauge, told me to put the proper crimp inline terminals on the end of the wire and call him when I was through. Needless to say, it took some time, strip, crimp and go to the next. Bob (his real name is Robert) came back sat down and proceeded to check each crimp using a pliers to pull on the crimp after wrapping the wire around a conduit pipe.  None could be pulled loose by him.  He looked at me and said: "You can work with me!"  We were together as a team for 4 years. I understand crimps, these are not crimps, the internal metal crimp appears to be SOFT ALUMINUM. This means you cannot solder them in a pinch and then slide the insulator on to the crimp and tape for a temporary fix.  NO I DO NOT RECCOMEND FOR ANY USE TO ANYONE for ANY JOB.	-1

Rubber is very tough and smells very bad.	-1
Arrived with a mystery white residue inside. No idea what it is, but it's hard to believe this is new if it's got this residue inside. Seeing other reviews, it looks like I'm not the only one who's gotten one with mystery gunk inside.  I'm relatively unconcerned with contamination, so I'm just going to clean mine and use it anyway. If that's not an option for you, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.	-1
Argh. Didn't realize when I purchased this that it is NOT glass. It is flint glass. Typically has titanium dioxide. Unfortunately for me this means I cannot use it for pouring acetone from large containers to small ones because acetone can dissolve titanium dioxide. I guess we've reached the point where I literally have to search for borosilicate glass -- as in glass when I search for "glass".	-1
Order a WilMad 1000ML 90mm Filter Apparatus Instead of this JUNK. It Doesn't Work as Intended. Might aswell, Not FILTER instead of using this.  Get a Proper Filtration funnel and Good Filter Papers - Medium Filter Rate	-1

Shoddy.  The "hinge" on one of the end supports cracked when I bent it up for assembly.	-1
Even after a 48hour cure to allow any solvent to off-gas, this stuff WILL STILL SUSTAIN A FLAME. Its not even self-extinguishing, let alone resistant to heat or flame. This product is a terrible, dangerous, fire PROMOTER, not blocker. Don't waste your money, just use the regular greatstuff, as neither provide a benefit in the event of a fire.	-1
The tube I received had hardened to the point where it could not be extruded with a caulking gun.  I opened the passages widely with a screw driver and still could not get the stuff out.  I cut open the tube out of curiosity and it had dried and hardened to the point of being useless.  Waste of money.	-1
Doesn't fit the tv jack	-1
This is not quick dry, at all. As I have found with all the hyped gorilla glue products, they simply don't perform. Yeah 20 minutes and counting still not dry......45 minutes starting to dry at edges -woo hoo- mind you this is a four drop application size - 1 hour drying from the edges inward still wet in the middle (45%) the droplets once settled were 1.5 mm high - 2 hours it's dry but tacky, HEY at 4 hours 20 minutes it's completely dry!!!!!! Not SUPER not even in the same universe folks. If you want High end Real Professional Super Glue buy TAK-PAK it comes with an accelerator spray that literally dries it Instantly and I mean Instant (don't have your skin anywhere near it, unless thats what your bonding)!!	-1
Not loving it.	-1
I bought the two pack of these hoping to make the kids a little more independent in the morning.  No bueno!  The design works well at first -- about as well as a full tube of tooth paste.  But as the product is used up, the plastic container requires a harder and harder squeeze to get the next dose.  Squeeze too hard and careful! A fat blob plops out.  Unlike a regular tube, it's difficult to judge how much product remains inside -- the plastic exterior retains its shape and there's no telling which end to bang the container to get it to slosh to the tip.  The second container's tip wasn't glued adequately to the container, so when removing or replacing the screw-on cap, the tip just spins and spins underneath.  We broke open the first (empty) container to see how this thing works (you can press firmly on the bottom and it pops own; bending the tip aggressively will cause it to pop of the container).  Inside is a very flimsy foil plastic bag. It's partially glued to the inside wall of the outer container. Ours had a big tear in it, and there was tooth paste smeared everywhere. Remember, this was our "empty" container! There was easily a week's worth of toothpaste left inside.  My advice is to stick with the regular tube. Although we had fun opening this up to figure out how it works, it did not give my boys the additional independence I had hoped it would, but conversely provided me a little dose of frustration.	-1
this does not fit ALL fixings, they are LYING, the t slot is only 5mm ,the standard t nut is 6mm, all metric size t nuts WILL NOT FIT, avoid this junk, buy the real thing	-1

These relays gave me trouble at first. They would not make the circuit when switched on/closed. I would tap them with screw driver and then they would make the circuit. I was in a bind at a job where I was using them for switching in a HVAC system. I opened them and slid piece of paper back and forth on contacts and it cured the problem. I suspect contamination on the contacts. Since doing that they have performed flawlessly.	-1
Terrible products. Poor quality. Does not hold a zero, Does not read same measurement, either defective or poorly designed (probably both).	-1
I just went to install this and I did not realize the instructions are to CUT into the Planer casing.  I would not have purchased it had I known this, so buyer be ware, if cutting the housing bothers you, don't purchase this.  As far as how it works for someone who did install it, you'll have to read other reviews.	-1
Its perfect if you need something to throw through a window!!  Unfortunately I bought it to strop knives which is what is is supposed to be for. This is a large piece for the price but it is as hard as a rock no exaggeration. Trying to apply it to a leather strop is pointless all it does is remove the treatment (vasoline in this case).  The seller responded to my email with what Im assuming is an automatic reply that contains some generic instructions which are irrelevant when the compound is rock hard.	-1
Too thin. Order 6 Mil and you will like it better	-1
After reading all the good reviews I was surprised when they arrived. I have several Nicholson files and they look and cut great. These Mexican knock off were not up to the Nicholson name. The reviews that had such high star reviews must not have used a genuine (Made in USA) Nicholson files before, because there is no comparison. They did have nice handles and pouch they came in.	-1
I ordered this bottle of calibration solution and it arrived contaminated. I wrote to the manufacturer requesting a new bottle. This is the reply I got:  "As for the solution. We cannot control the quality of the 342 after you purchase it and should be kept out of sunlight and a cool temp. We have no knowledge of the contaminant it may have be subject to. Thank you,  Rod Carmer T: 310-410-3100 C: 909-734-7634"	-1
No cloth backing, just thin plastic. It shreads itself if you just look at the wrong way.  Worst tape I have ever bought.  Absolute junk.  I cannot say enough bad things about it.  You will be very sorry if you spend any money on this.  Look else where for duct tape.  This is definitly NOT duct tape.	-1

Way too small.  Flimsy, cheap, definitely unsafe for use in any practical wire rope application.  I didn't even bother to to take them out of the package.  Shown in the picture is one of the thimble size I am replacing, which is what I expected to receive, vs this time waster from amazon.  Happy I was able to source my wire rope locally and for a much better price.	-1
