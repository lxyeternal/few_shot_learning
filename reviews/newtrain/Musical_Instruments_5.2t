bought this for an acoustic that was fretting out and within two weeks of use no more fretting. easy to use	1
Great fit, like the original	1
Doesn't fit my son's guitar. Not worth the hassle of returning or exchanging.	-1
Doesn't fit my son's guitar. Was bought as a gift. Don't buy in advance! By the time he got it and figured out that it doesn't fit his guitar, the seller refused to even do an exchange for another product!	-1
Bought this to replace creme colored switch on my Gibson LP Standard. It's as advertised and it fits. One gripe:  $5 for a 0.10 piece of tiny plastic?  Ouch!  But what are you gonna do?  Cheers	1
i wanted to change out the cream tips on a couple of my SGs with black tips. The first tip I purchased was not a Gibson part and did not fit ( it might have worked on a Epiphone). It was a smaller diameter & threads didn't work.. Since then I have bought 2 of these Gibson tips and they are perfect. Buy Gibson for your Gibson!	1
Toggle tip, great quality perfect color perfect fit. Perfect product for your Gibson!	1
Junk, split at the seam first time I screwed it onto my new switchcraft switch.	1
incredibly effective - beyond my expectations!	1
This guy is made like a tank and functions exactly as advertised...great value, shipped and delivered quickly.  Extra long cord...will probably buy more of these for gig work with my group's sound equipment.	1
Shred a credit card statement, the DSL drops.  The cordless phone rings, the DSL drops.  Turn on a lamp (with CFL bulbs), the DSL drops.  After trying all the usual fixes (plug the DSL gateway into a separate circuit with its own surge suppressor power strip, move it farther away from the cordless phone, coil up the slack in the DSL modem cable) it became clear we needed something even stronger.  If this Furman power strip can filter out power line noise for DJs and musicians, could it do the same for computer gear?  Yes.  I even thrash-tested it by rapidly flipping the reverse switch on the document shredder to bombard the room with EMI mini-bursts, calling my home phone from my iPhone and flickering the lights on and off.  The line stayed up, and has done so since I replaced the wimpy power strip with this one.  The faster your DSL line, the more you need this kind of power protection.  It won't fix problems on the DSL line itself, but it will deliver clean noise-free power to your DSL modem or gateway, and many times, that's all you need.	1
I have owned several Furman PL series power conditioner products, and can attest to their being an absolute necessity in the studio, and onstage.  Though the Furman SS-6B does NOT offer "Standard Level Power Conditioning" (and should be removed from the product description), it does provide the best EMI/RFI noise attenuation of any power strip I've used, and it's built like a tank.  Don't believe the hype - or waste your money - on lesser "noise filtering" plastic power strips.  The Furman SS-6B is a small investment that's worth every cent.	1
Never had any equipment get burned while using this thing (of course, haven't had many power failures either). This thing is metal / sturdy and the best thing is......The SUPER long cord!!	1
For the money, this strap is as good as any other poly strap.  Plus, it was made in the U.S.A.!	1
they don't cost a lot and they work well.  They are inexpensive and they work.  I have purchased 5 of these for my guitars and they are nice	1
Honestly, I absurdly hate just about every remo snare head out there. They are so metallic sounding. They completely kill the natural sound of the wood. The genera dry head is absolutely amazing. The sound is so much more of a "crack" or "pop" but very woody sounding. You get the natural tone of the wood of the snare. And I'll tell you what. The combination of a Genera Dry and my DW Performance snare is a party in my ears. So natural. Perfect for recording as well. The head is also very responsive. Ghost notes are clear, and I'm pleasantly surprised with the durability. The coating doesn't lift like remo heads, and for a 10mil head, it holds up well to a heavy hitter like myself. I've had this head on for a month and play over ten hours a week, and I don't plan on changing it anytime soon. Perfect head.	1
Sounds great, no complaints, less ring, great tone, great price, sounds good on recordings, I would recommend to any drummer..	1
I don't know if I will purchase this head again, but it is what it says it is - it sounds a bit different.	1
I've got this head on the top of an Anton Fig signature Yamaha snare drum, I use it in our LA recording studio and i love the way the drum sounds with this head, no annoying overtones or ringing, just a great "pop" that cuts through the mix without any EQ.  The key to the dry sound is the built-in damping ring on the underside of the drum, you don't need those overtone dampening rings with this head, the deadening is built in so you just get the true sound of your snare drum without the "wang-yaoonng" after tone.  A professional drumming friend suggested I try a particular Aquarian head he liked, it lasted on my snare drum for one day before I went back to this Evans. I know some drummers who think it's too dead but I love it in the studio and listeners love the sound of it recorded.  I'm so glad to see these available on Amazon my favorite drum supply store :-)  Good luck and good music to all.	1
Works for me. But It splits the two middle strings way more than my peace of mind allows me to be comfortable with it. They made it thinner so it doesn't stretch the strings too much & as a consequence, it will only fit a thin sponge which dries easy as far as Arizona & California is concerned.  Suggestion to Planet Waves: I think you can make it thicker but instead of splitting the strings, redesign the mount, say with a Velcro so that it's still hangs on the sound hall but it's attached to the strings. It's possible to attach your product in a different way because I've modified mine & to my personal preference works without splitting the screen.	1
This is a very simple humidifier to use. It is easy to insert and remove and causes no damage. The round humidifiers that cover the sound hole that I have been using can cause some damage to certain types of finishes (can chip away lacquer from the friction of inserting and removing them). My only request would be to make a denser sponge that holds more water. This model stays moist for a week or more but it would be nice if it lasted even longer.	1
I bought this product with the notion of being cheap No refills to buy, except distilled water.  In all actuality, its a really simple design.  I like this design better because of one simple fact.  If the wood in your guitar is already dry, you'll have to refill your humidifier more often initially.  i'd rather be using distilled water than hydration pack refills that are required in some other guitar humidifiers.  After the guitar gets "hydrated?", I usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days.  It definitely gets taken several time between refills, so it's not that much of a hassle.  Overall, good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother.  Try not to over-douse the sponge in order to avoid water damage to the guitar.  Peace out and cheers  ~J	1
It's a switch tip and it's stock.  Perfect for a broken or replacement.	1
As showed in the picture...	1
Um, no. It certainly looks authentic, however does not fit a Gibson 2003 plus top les paul, Dean standard or epiphone fx pro plus top. It does however fit my Chibson Ace freshly les paul perfect (Chinese reproduction) Sounds like this May not be an authentic Gibson product.	-1
Just like the originals. Couldn't be better. Makes my Les Paul 60s Tribute look better with the new pickup rings I also purchased.	1
The beautifully amber Gibson switch cover helps me to look like I know what I am doing, why are you read a review for this thing? Theft break fro the genius Gibson case every once in a while so just don't go back to cream.	1
I recently got a Les Paul Traditional that I wanted to make some minor cosmetic changes to give it a more vintage feel. One of the changes was the switch tip. For some reason, Gibson uses creme plastics and binding but then gives you a glowing white switch tip. I thought about soaking the tip in coffee to darken it up but figured I'd go with the one that's already dark from the factory. There are plenty of other options out there for tips and they don't make a ton of difference but I like the little details.	1
It works perfectly. It's what I was looking for. I like this brand and the products they make. You should give it a try.	1
We all know that the SG's and Les Paul's of those vintage years had amber switch tips and that they look AWESOME.  It's so funny, just the slightest of modifications makes your guitar look very different.  I put this on my sunburst Les Paul Trad Pro and I'll never go back to the white tip.  However, I should note that when I pointed this out to my fiance and parents, they hardly noticed.  So, only get this if you are doing it for yourself, and your own notions of what you what in your guitar.  I personally love the idea of playing an instrument that traces it's origins back to Bloomfield, Duane Allman, Clapton, and the like, and I want a little touch that harkens back to that era - - so it works for me!	1
I'm rating this 5 stars because it is as described -- it does indeed fit a Gibson Les Paul perfectly and is completely functional. However, I also feel the need to emphasize to others that this will not fit an Epiphone Les Paul (LP-100). The interior cavity is too large.	1
It doesn't fit my Les Paul SG. I really don't see why a simple part such as this must come in different screw sizes. Stupid on both parts. Stupid Gibson for not standarizing the toggle switch screw size for the knob and stupid me for not seeing that coming.	1
I have one of these in every one of my cases. It's a plastic sponge holder with holes in it; nothing special but it does the job.	1
There really isn't a lot you can say about this item other than it works! I use expensive guitars and I know the importance of humidification to keep your instrument in top shape and these work.	1
I have two nice Taylor's - a steel string and a nylon string, both with solid wood tops and sides. Considering the investment, I take very good care of them. From November through the end of March, I keep them in a room with a door when they are not in the case. I run a room humidifying with distilled water 24/7 in that room throughout the dry season. I also use one of these in each guitar whenever I am not playing them. Part of the nighttime routine is filling the room humidifier tank and dipping the sponges and setting these Planet waves humidifiers in the sound holes. The whole process takes a few minutes and is worth it to keep my guitars in great condition. When I take the guitars anywhere, I put one of these in each sound hole before I put the guitars in their cases. Winter whether in New England get extremely dry in the cold months, so these are necessary. Easy to use. Durable. Simple.	1
My preferred strap was a hand made leather with my name on it, but it wasn't adjustable.  I bought this one for its adjustability.	1
A very attractive and well constructed strap. I've been somewhat disappointed with some of the more expensive straps but this one is Excellent...................AND NOT SO EXPENSIVE. All the Buttons fit well (Snug) and it adjusts easily and quickly.	1
Great inexpensive strap.  Really, what more can you say?  I wanted something to hold my guitar up, and it does just that.	1
I like this strap.  I like it a lot.  I have never seen anyone using a strap of this color, or quality.  It holds my guitar like a tiny adorable baby, and breathes new life into all of my performances.	1
This is a good clear and crisp head.  the holes in it definatley increase the volume it puts out and also attract alot of people to the snare.  I cannot say how many times people have said to me (Dude! whats that crazy head youve got on there!)	1
I had a standard remo pinstripe head originally. Lots of ringing. Hard to tune a set when the main thing you have to do is minimize all the ringing. This head helped alot. It does sacrifice a little bit of the natural sound of a snare but the lack of ringing makes it worth it in my opinion. This snare head is great	1
The Vandoren ZZ reeds are available two ways, individually wrapped in a box with a yellow tab on the top, versus unwrapped in a box with a grey tab (where the size number is listed). The picture above indicates they would be unwrapped and in a grey-tab box, but they shipped me the more expensive individually-wrapped reeds in the full-color box instead. I don't know if that's always the case, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm not sure if having the individual "humidity-control" wrapping really makes them play better, but considering they're expensive reeds I like getting them that way. I think if the seller updated the picture to reflect the product is the more-expensive version they could sell more. Unless they just substituted that once because they were low on the others. But I'm going to keep ordering from this seller and see if I keep getting the pricier version for this price.  Oh yeah and btw these are the best reeds for jazz if you want a big tone. I noticed a huge difference over both the LaVoz cane reeds or the Fibracell reeds I used to use.	1
I love to go out and try diffrent reeds for my clarinet and tenor sax. As soon as I found these however, I don't want to look for any more! These are far better then the regular vandoreen reeds. However if you play quiet, concert music, you may want to look else where. Maby java or java reds. But If you play in Jazz band like me or play or play too quietly and need brighter sound, these are for you. And I don't know about anyone else but personally I love to use these when they are brand new, once broken in they don't sound as jazzy as I like but even then the best so far!	1
Before this year, I never realized just what damage the cold dry air can reap on a good guitar.  This is easy:  Fill the sponge with water, ring it out and place it between the string of guitar (has small hooks to catch strings so it stays in place). Then, ALWAYS, place the guitar into the case.  I used to have all mine on display - not a good idea in a cold Wisconsin winter.  The lack of humidity started drying out the wood on the guitars and I developed "Fret Buzz" with a vengeance! The humidifiers are quite useless if not kept in a case as the sponge dries out quickly.  When in the case, the sponge will last a couple of days - then, need to be re-moistened.  If your guitars were in the shape of mine, this is not a quick fix.  It has taken one of my guitars two weeks to come back to it's bright tone.  I had more guitars than cases - so, ended up buying more cases. If you have cold, dry winters this is a must for you guitars.  Don't forget the cases!	1
I thought I would throw my two-cents in about the new design and effectiveness of this soundhole humidifier.  After making a few homemade case humidifiers out of things like a travel butter container with many holes drilled into it and a sponge, I started thinking about how some of the cases separate the body cavity from the neck & headstock cavity inside the guitar case and not allowing the humidity to flow freely to all areas, especially the body where it is needed the most.  Even though I was getting acceptable humidification in the case I was concerned about the body being dryer in comparison so I went ahead and splurged the 8 bucks on these. (I actually bought three of them.)  I crank the gas heat up in the house in the winter and A/C in the summer, keep my guitars inside their cases and inside a closet. The humidity drops quite low, but the sponges remain moist for several days before I can no longer fight the urge to re-wet them. lol.  Two great tips in one: Use a regular, more dense sponge, thicker like the ones at the dollar store. Cut them to size and stuff them in! Throw away the sponge when it starts to get yucky and don't worry about distilled water, unless you want to. I can't argue using very pure water compared to the possibly toxic crap that comes out our faucets, but for one dollar you can get a boat load of them after you cut them to size, and toss them away without any regard when needing replaced.  Don't worry about the "thing" hanging in-between your strings. It will not damage anything unless you get the sponge  too saturated and it leaks. I will either squeeze the excess water out, or shake the container with the sponge inside until I am satisfied that it won't drip.  The humidifier will not cause any stress or damage to your strings by spreading them when you wedge this inside your soundhole.  If you ARE rough, careless, thoughtless, or stupid, you could possibly knock this loose and have it rub or fall out, but I would be more worried about the guitar and what it would take for this to happen. This would be more extreme to the guitar than the humidifier or any harm it could cause.  The top snaps on by squeezing the sides to release little tabs that stick through the top cover. The sponge inside is quite small, and there isn't too much room for a much larger sponge. The device is simple and fairly solid. Treat it gently and it will last forever. You can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher. If you give the inside a quick rinse every few fills, I'm sure it would be a decade before anything "built up" to require extensive cleaning or replacement.  Keep an eye on it for the first few days and then weeks to get a feel for when you should be re-wetting the sponge. Try to keep the sponge moist when it's dry.  I strongly suggest getting an Oasis case humidifier, (or similar) mini sized about 1" X 4" costing around 17-20 bucks. This will take any guesswork out of the equation and give you fairly accurate readings inside your guitar or instrument case.  Remember, too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp. Too dry and it will shrink and crack, split the soundboard (top) also leaving the edges of the frets sticking out like the backbone of a fish and quite abrasive!  If you spent more than one hundred dollars on your guitar and live where it gets cold and/or dry, you would be negligent (if not careless) to spend the pittance to make sure your 'baby ain't thirsty', or worse...dead & broken!  Hope this helps!	1
My grandson was thrilled to receive it, because he had just received a new acoustic guitar for Christmas and he said he needed one of these to put in the case with his new guitar.	1
Excellent product, simple and practical design,holds firmly inside the guitar mouth and keeps humidity levels in the safe zone. If humidity levels in your area go below 40% you simply need to provide extra humidity to prevent cracks.	1
I've tried leather straps, I've tried Rocksteady straps, I still keep coming back to this strap. It's steady, Highly adjustable. And it works very nicely with the Dunlop Dual Design Straplok system. Good job Ernie Ball! I even prefer this to a nice Levy's strap that I own because the Ernie Ball strap is a bit slipperier	1
I am a big fan of rainbows and I bought myself a new acoustic guitar for Christmas, and wanted a strap, new guitar - new strap, LOL  The quality is great and it is easy to adjust and attach to the guitar.  Great price too.	1
I have been a fan of very few drumhead brands and styles. The Evans G2 make my drums sing. The tone is perfect and the mid-range attack that they produce has allowed me to use them with the multiple bands that I play in. I need versatility as I am playing in 5 bands with music variety from big band to rock, pop, and country. Highly recommended all around!	1
An outer ply of 5mil film and an inner ply of 7.5mil film, in combination with a 2mil overtone control ring on the underside that "floats" with the head, eliminating excessive overtones and controlling sustain. Precision-drilled dry vents around the perimeter of head reduce overtones and control sustain.	1
I just reskinned my Yamaha snare drums with this Genera HD Dry. What a big difference. The tone is focused, powerful, with no nasty overtones. I don't even use my damper rings on these. But I did use four Moon Gels to get the super dry sound I was looking for. My snare just sounds great and I can't stop playing them. (I'm typing this one handed as I pound out a beat." ;-)	1
this drum head here, THIS DRUM HEAD RIGHT HERE! WOW! will sound A-MAZING in a recording. It cuts out any overtones and will get the purest sound from your snare possible. I don't recommend this snare for venues unless you're mic'd up, its a little to dry for live settings, but it will still be heard, as the descriptions says it will bark live, and it sure does bark but could use a little more bite, if you know what I mean. I've used this head on every snare for recording and it just sings and will give back to you every time.	1
I buy these because they are long enough for me. I am over six feet tall and most lower priced straps just are not long enough. They are good quality and work well.	1
Thanks	1
A good inexpensive way to hydrate a guitar. Tip: replace the sponge with wet wrung out microfiber cloth. The Planet Waves will last 5 times longer before re-hydration. Be sure to use distilled water or the microfiber will mildew and start smelling.	1
Purchased this to replace the Dampit as a no drip alternative. With the solid base it will not drip and it fairly easy to use. Distilled water will extend the life of the sponge. Overall simple and effective.  However, I may have added too much humidity. Was using in conjunction with humidipak to keep them from drying out thinking they would absorb any excess humidity, but I then noticed an irregularity in the reflection of the pick guard and the tone seemed to be muted so shifted over to humidipak only and will re humidify them outside the guitar case.  I do use a hydrometer but I don't think it was effectively reading the inside of the guitar, but only the inside of the case.  So I think the Planet Waves humidifier works well for its intended purpose, but you do have to monitor that you are not over or under utilizing it.	1
I just needed a couple of these for my classical. amazon is always good about having products in stock. They had them at a good price. this humidifier is great - I highly recommend it.	1
Like keeping my guitar on a guitar stand.  Works well and keeps the wood protected.  If using on a guitar that's out of a case, make sure to check the internal sponge frequently to keep moist.	1
Have this in my favorite acoustic guitar and wouldn't leave home without it. Living now in Phoenix and traveling to Colorado every few months this is an essential part of my kit (both very dry climates). I have seen what letting an acoustic dry out does and never want it to happen to mine.	1
I use and reuse these sponges but wanted a couple extra just in case. I need to rinse them in the dishwasher every couple of weeks to keep them clean, or I also rinse them out with antibacterial soap. When I first started using them I noticed a smell from my guitar after about two weeks - it was the sponge smelling foul. I cleaned it and no more problem. I have also tried dipping them in distilled water with a small amount of scent, like Fa-breeze, or a lavender scent. It makes the guitar and case smell nice.	1
I have had other brands, but I do prefer these over the other's simply because how they sit in the guitar.  They are all nothing more than a sponge in a housing, but this housing works best for me.  I need to find something for my 1955 Hofner (BEATLE) Bass.  It's a hollow body, but no "F" holes, or any other means to humidify it.  At this point, I have one of these in the case, and keep the guitar in there with it.  Checking on all of them is a routine managed by MS OUTLOOK.	1
These are great deal compared to a guitar center want a humidity is one of those things where you can't see it working you can just see it if your guitar starts cracking but for the price I would recommend never be too safe with a nice Guitar	1
This strap is a great product. very strong and good colors. i would recommend  it to anyone who wants a good strap and a good cost.	1
A nice simple adjustable strap that has well reinforced ends to hold the attachment posts on my guitar without any worries.  It is a bit slippery so for top-heavy guitars like Les Pauls the neck tends to keep slipping down so you have to support it with your fret hand a little.  I thinking of sewing a silicon mat on the underside so it will stay put on my shoulder.	1
Nice basic guitar strap.. Great price and should last long enough.  I have started using the padded Levies strap as it doesnt hurt my shoulder like a regular strap. This can be a little scratchy	1
It's simple, basic, but I don't think it does that good of a job. This is because it doesn't really humidify that much and doesn't extend very far into the guitar.	-1
Fits nicely into my acoustic guitars. Just requires you to dampen the sponge with distilled water. Luckily I keep that on hand!	1
I live in New Mexico and it is DRY most of the time.  I own 2 nice Taylor guitars that need humidification and I've tried various devices to accomplish this.  Oasis was a mess and ultimately the crystals quit working or fell out or who knows what.  I've also used the classic Damp-It which seems to dry out faster and would get mineral residue on the sponge causing it to get hard and be non-functional unless using distilled water.  The sponge on the Planet Waves is easily replaced by trimming a kitchen sponge and I like that it hangs between strings and never touches the wood.  The only negative is that the last one I bought seemed to have a defect in the plastic clip that holds the lid on and broke within a week of order.  Otherwise, I have not had any issues and will continue to use this until somebody comes up with something better that is affordable.	1
Planet Waves humidifiers are simple to use and a great product to guard against drying your guitar and causing splitting. Dampen the sponge, squeeze out excess water, insert the sponge into the holder and the holder between hte strings. Check on it every few days and keep the sponge damp. Couldn't be any easier. I use them all winter long in my guitars.	1
If you have a guitar over $500, it's definitely worth investing in some kind of humidifying tool. This fits the bill nicely, and the price is right. There are no fancy electronics, no timers or anything, so you'll just need to check it the old fashioned way with your eyeballs and fingers. I've been snagging distilled water from my bio lab and haven't had any gunky salt build up. I may invest in a gallon of DI water I found here on Amazon later, but for now it works. If you have a really high-end guitar, I'd recommend getting something better like a humi-case with a built-in hygrometer and humidifier, but for the starting musician it works just fine.	1
I like purple, and it is purple. The strap is sturdy. It works, what else needs to be said; it arrived timely, is decent quality, and a nice color.	1
It looks great. It feels great. It serves its purpose. It isn't cheaply made. What more can you ask for in a product? I will probably order more in other colors after the holidays. I really like the dark green.	1
It's an okay strap. The lock doesn't really stay in place, but it'll do for now until I get a leather strap.	1
i've had this strap for at least a year now, and it still works so well. goes great with my guitar too!	1
This is my second Ernie Ball strap i have gotten, and sure there are cheaper straps out there its a crapshoot what your going to get from them. These straps have leather ends that hold the guitar securely, the strap itself is a step down from a seatbelt (If a seatbelt will keep me in place at high speeds this strap will keep your guitar in place at low speeds), and the length would be sufficient even if you are 7 ft. tall. Coming in several different colors to match any color guitar this is the only strap i will buy in the future.	1
it does what it says it does.  only complaint is that sponge is very small and in very dry areas it needs to be checked and refilled 2 times a week.	1
can't tell if it makes a difference or not but I have peace of mind that i'm protecting my guitars from drying out	1
Love these reeds.  I often use these.	1
Thank you!	1
If you love your guitars and want them to last and get better with age, then this item is a mush have. Get a jug of "Distilled Water" (this is critical) dunk the sponges into the distilled water, let them sit for a bit then wring them out. Place in the holder, suspend from the strings into the sound hole and check every 3-4 days to make sure they still feel moist.  Money well spent.  Use in all my guitars...Martin, Taylor, Breedlove, Epiphone, Cort. Simple and effective and very economical.	1
Great build quality, works like it should. Feels comfortable to wear also. No complaints at all :) Great color also considering my guitar is a shade of green :D	1
This strap kicks butt im a tall and big guy so its hard to find longer straps for cheap and baby is long if I have it to max its TO LONG that never happened to me and im 6 4 300 LBS so if your tall buy it don't waste your time with the Planet Wave ones there junk too short and the leather ends are really thin and brake after a few weeks of hard usage	1
It's comfortable. It's adjustable. The color was a good match for the guitar. Unless you regularly gig for hours at a time, why spend 50+ smackers on a strap when this one does just fine? Put the dough into the guitar, not the strap. By several colors for whatever look you are going for at the time.	1
Great reeds.	1
This is good for now! Keeps my guitar from drying out, warping, cracking,! For the money it works! Recommend this product.	1
I bought this guitar humidifier for my Taylor. I received exactly what I purchased and works as it should.  This product has been recommended to me by many other guitar players around me. It is a simple design that fits perfectly between the strings. Easy to use because really all you have to do is moisturize the sponge and keep it in the plastic container.  Price is good.	1
So sexy with my SG. Great quality. I was going to get a pink furry one... this is better I think.	1
Good quality Guitar Strap at a very good price. I do recommend using strap locks on this and any strap.	1
Finally I found a long strap for my new guitar.  I had bought one earlier that was leather, but was way too short.  It felt like my guitar hung around my neck.  This new strap is plenty long enough, and looks good.  My only negative is that it is sharp on the sides of the strap so most players will feel it on their neck, but it sure fits nice and long.  I would recommend this to any guitar player.	1
Ok...time for a chime-in here.  You need something for humidity control if you live in any extreme of cold or heat.  This means most anywhere in the world, folks.  Your guitar is an investment.  These are better than nothing...and many consider them just as good as the more expensive when you FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS.  Come on guys...I know we don't like to read 'em...but you have to exert some effort for this to work.  1) buy a gallon of distilled water. This greatly lessens the opportunity for mold.  2) the sponge should be damp...NOT SATURATED, NOT WET. D.A.M.P.  3) you will have to check it on a daily basis.  Optimally when you check it, it shouldn't be bone dry.  If it is, moisten the sponge again.  This is ongoing.  4) keep in a hardshell case.  NOT a gig-bag!  Keep the case closed...this regulates the temperature...and is much safer than leaving your guitar hanging out.  If you are getting water spots, or mold...you DIDN'T follow the directions.  I have these on all 5 of my acoustic guitars (none of which were cheap) and have NEVER had an ounce of trouble.	1
It's nothing fancy but it works great for my electric guitar well worth the price And it is durable For how light it is	1
I figured at this price I wouldn't be able to use this strap to secure my Dean from Hell guitar. But figured if it wasn't up to being a reliable strap for my expensive & pretty heavy ax that I could always use it for my Rock Band guitar. And I'm rather certain that this strap will outlast the Rock Band guitar. So very pleased with this strap & would recommend it for any beginner with a inexpensive guitar that's likely 1/4 plastic and very lightweight.	1
bold, bright, easy to play along the whole sax.  Not stuffy at all.  I buy the 2.5 version.  Solid altissimo range...  very nice.	1
I find these to be reliable, versatile reeds if you're looking for a buzzy sound with a good core. They also are the most consistent boxes of reeds I buy - I know it's hard to control quality on reeds because they're a natural material, but 4 of 5 regularly play well straight from the box. Some boxes all 5 are great.  Good for jazz, pop, and rock. Probably not such a good choice if you're trying to blend into a wind ensemble or play a saxophone concerto. This also depends on your mouthpiece, but a traditional French file cut might be better if you want a smoother, rounder sound	1
This was my first strap. It looks good, feels pretty strong, and it is difficult to strap to the guitar. By being difficult, I mean it takes some time to squeeze it to the buttons, and it holds on tight. This makes me feel safe having my guitar suspended about three to four feet above the ground. You can't beat the price either!	1
It's a plain jane guitar strap at a great price and holds my guitar in place.  It's not the most comfortable or the most fancy, but it does the job just fine.	1
Excellent strap for the price. Doesn't feel cheap and does the job. The leather ends are sturdy and haven't worn lose over the past couple years and the vinyl is still clean and sturdy feeling/looking.	1
For the price and the brand name, you can't beat it! A strap purchased locally would cost 35% more and then add the price of gas....do the math. A great deal!!	1
Made of quality material. I do not need anything fancy,because I am a simle person! It does a first class job on my vintage electric guitar!	1
perfect size for us big guys. i do recommend some snap locks for it though. . . . . .	1
This is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole.  It would not work for an f-hole archtop or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele.  Inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge.  If you use distilled water (as recommended) it should last quite a while.  The top comes off with a gentle press on the sides.  The dry sponge can be a little difficult to remove with fingers but tweezers or needle nose pliers work perfectly.  Don't push it all the way in after moistening and you won't have a problem.  I drip a little distilled water on the sponge, squeeze out any excess, and the assembled case pops in easily between the D and G strings, suspended in the middle of the sound hole.  They can't be seen in the photo but there are small ridges on each side that hold the top in place against the strings.  I've never had one of these move from where I left it.  If the sponge isn't dripping wet you should never have a problem with drops of water in the guitar or case.  When the humidity is very low (30% or less) the sponge dries out in 2 to 3 days even if the case isn't opened.  As with most humidifiers of this type you will have to check every few days.  If you have ever had a crack appear in the top of favorite guitar (or don't want to see one) use a guitar humidifier!  Especially during the winter - heating a house tends to drop the indoor humidity below safe levels (between 45% and 60% is ideal for most guitars).  Air conditioning can do the same.  For especially valuable guitars it would be worth buying a hygrometer to keep in the case but for most guitars having one in the room where you keep you guitar(s) is okay.  For many reasons it's always best to keep your guitar in a case or gig bag when not in use.  A humidifier is inexpensive extra precaution at those times of year when temperature or humidity changes quickly.	1
This is a upgraded version of the guitar humdifier, The first one had that green stuff that florists use in it and you used a plastic syringe to ad water to it. This has a replaceable sponge, you take it out, soak it and squeeze out excess then put it back in container, would say it gets more humidity out.	1
This is a very well made humidifier, I love how it just rests nicely suspended by your strings. It keeps my acoustic in good condition.  My only issue is the weak sponge that comes with it had to be refilled every 2 days or so, it didn't hold the moisture. I bought a cheap little sponge at the grocery store and cut a piece and put it in, now it works great. You may want to consider doing that	1
This is another great reed for jazz playing. Has that classic jazz sound of the 50s and 60s.	1
My daughter loves these with her Tenor Sax.  Great sound.  Quick break in.  Excellent flexibility.	1
Recommended.	1
I needed a strap that's a little longer to use with acoustic guitars and this works perfect, in fact I bought several...for $3.00 bucks you can't beat it.	1
This is a great strap!  And the price is wonderful!  A person doesn't need to spend big bucks, to get a decent guitar strap!  I have a classical electric acoustic guitar, and the strap looks great on it!  Recommend this item to anyone!	1
Good construction and great price. Arrived on time and in great condition. Ernie Ball guitar straps are well made and will last a lifetime.	1
Nice color and nice strap... it fitted my Ibanez bass guitar and my Yamaha guitar. I cant complain on this	1
Cheap doesn't mean "bad" in this case. The Ernie Ball polypro is the all-time best guitar strap ever made. Comfortable. Timeless style. Hard-wearing.  They are ubiquitous for a reason. I've owned dozens of these things by now now, I guess, and have never worn one out...just left a few of 'em in sundry places accidentally. They're so cheap it's no big deal and they just work - and on every type of guitar.  If Ernie Ball ever quits making these I will order 100 and hoard them.	1
Worked great to add some much-needed friction to the cords on my ever-slipping Roman shades. A few swipes of this on the pull cords where they engage the locking hardware and they now stay where I put them. Easy fix, great rosin for that job.	1
5 stars	1
I recently bought my son a nice new PDP drum kit and I wanted to make sure he had a good head tuner. Tuned drums are by FAR better than drums left to their own devices. Tuned drums project better, sound better and have properly aligned harmonic overtones. That said, you would think you could use a standard drum key to achieve good tuning.  Well, you could. You could if you have all day to do it and a lot of patience and a really good ear. The Evans Torque key allows you to set the default tension for a particular drum head and then perfectly match all the other lugs to that torque setting. So it's not automatic, it still takes some skill to get the drum initially tuned right, but this tool makes it OH SO MUCH EASIER. So easy that even my 14 year old son is expert at it already.	1
A great little tool for your pocket. Just dial in the torque setting you want consistently set for your drum heads and tighten. The key hinges open when desired torque is reached so that no more tightening can happen. Snap it back and move onto the next bolt. A fail-safe way to consistently set the torque on your drums.	1
I generally use the Rhythm Tech Memo Key (ASIN B0002E2EOE) to tune my heads, but this one is as good and has a feature I like more than the Rhythm Tech model - this tuning key clicks and disengages when the dialed-in torque is attained whereas the Rhythm Tech model requires you to reset a lever.  It is simple to use.  All you do is hand tighten your lugs, set the dial on the key to an initial setting, then go around your drum in the standard opposing tightening pattern.  Test, and increase the dial setting until you get the sound you want. Once you do achieve the sound I strongly recommend that you write the settings down so you can quickly dial in your preferred tuning the next time you tune your drums or change heads.  A few things to consider: tuning involves more than just the batter side heads, which is especially true in the case of snare drums.  Unless you are seeking a flat sound, do not tune the resonant heads to the same torque as the batter side heads, else the heads will cancel each other out because they will be vibrating at the same frequency.  Also, make sure your lugs are lightly oiled so that each has uniform resistance or the torque settings will be inaccurate. Finally, if you cannot get the sound you are looking for between setting increments (i.e., between dial setting #3 and #4), use a standard key and try one eigth turn increments.  Regardless of whether you play as a hobby or professionally, this key is an amazing tool that will allow you to quickly and easily change the dynamics of your drums.	1
Good price. Arrived when expected. They didn't work for me, but I know another sax player who likes them. That's the way reeds go. You have to find what works for you.	1
This is a replacement purchase and anticipate the same quality as before.  My sax player husband is very happy with the quality of this product.	1
These are pretty good reeds, I prefer both of the Java varieties to them however, they feel a little less responsive to me. Though take that with a grain of salt because every player is different. If you're looking for a good jazz reed, give it a shot, but I'd take the Java's over these.	1
I am fairly new to tenor sax, and I prefer reeds without a lot of resistance, and I favor a brighter jazz sound.  I have experimented with Rico Plasticover reeds, Rico La Voz, Rico Select (unfiled), Vandoren ZZ, Vandoren Java (filed and unfiled), traditional Vandoren reeds, and even a Legere Signature Series reed.  I found the ZZ tenor sax reeds to be consistent, ready to play out of the box, and easy to play using a classic style ebonite mouthpiece as well as a more open mouthpiece.  (MAY, 2015 UPDATE: I  TRIED FIBRACELL REEDS WITH MY T75 JUMBO JAVA MOUTHPIECE---- THE FIBRACELL REEDS ARE AMONG MY FAVORITE REEDS NOW. THEY LAST LONGER THAN ANY REED THAT I HAVE TRIED AND THE QUALITY AND SOUND IS CONSISTENTLY GOOD).  Here is my experience with the various reeds that I have tried over the last sixth months:  I have been able to achieve my best sound with Vandoren ZZ and the Rico Select Jazz (unfiled) reeds, and these reeds didn't require sanding to get them to play well.  The Rico Jazz Select (unfiled) can be a little stiff, so I would visit the Rico reed website to see their  strength comparison chart ([...] to help you select the right strength for you.  I found the traditional Vandoren reeds to be similar to the ZZ, so either will play well.  I just received an order of Vandoren Java reeds, and I found the Red Javas (filed) to be resistant and not bright, so I am hoping that they will become easier to play with break-in.  I also just tried the Java Green (unfiled), and they were a little less resistant than the Reds, and they were more fun to play than the Java Reds. (UPDATE 5/2015: THE JAVA GREEN READS WERE VERY EASY TO PLAY WITH MY NEW T75 JUMBO JAVA MOUTHPIECE----VERY PLEASING SOUND TOO). I would describe it as a deeper sound. I will try another box of Java Greens in the future, but the Java Reds did not work for me at all.  Rico Plasticover reeds play easily and last a long time.  The Plasticovers are enjoyable because you don't have to wet the reed, and they play well right out of the box.  I have heard a lot of good things about the Rico La Voz reeds, but for me they were just OK.  The box that I received contained many reeds which were warped and required sanding to get them to play well. I used 400 grit wet/dry sandpaper to flatten out the La Voz reeds (I set the sandpaper on a truly flat surface and slid the reed over the sandpaper, and only sanded the portion of the reed that sits on the table of the mouthpiece) ---sand very little. The Rico Jazz Selects (unfiled) played well out of the box and have a lively sound, so I would go with those over the La Voz reeds (realizing the price is higher).  The Legere Signature Series plastic reed might work for marching band or if your sax has to sit for a long time, drying out your reed.  However, I didn't care for this reed because the highs wanted to breakup, and I didn't have that problem with any other reed.  For Marching Band or gigs (whenever you are worried about reeds drying out), I would give Rico Plasticover reeds a try.  Different reeds will work for different people, depending on the mouthpiece, ligature, embouchure, etc., but I hope this might be helpful to other new players.	1
I needed a new strap but I didn't want to pay $20 for one. I saw the ernie ball ones and decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. The strap is awesome. It's very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap I've ever had. It totally deserves 5 stars!	1
I've always loved the ernie ball straps from playing it all the way down to your knees, all the way up to you chest the strap never fails, I've owned countless ernie ball straps and I always come back to them for the main reason, I've never had one fail! a great strap for a great price	1
This is just what it looks like - a very economical strap.  The great thing about it is the length.  As any other tall person will tell you, finding a strap that adjusts to longer than normal can be frustrating.  This strap is very long, if you need it to be.  For the price, very hard to beat this.  Works well with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dunlop-Dual-Design-Straplok-System-Black/dp/B0002CZW3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dunlop Dual Design Straplok System, Black</a>&nbsp;too.  Overall, a good buy, for a backup strap or your primary.	1
I was displeased with a somewhat poor-quality strap I was using before.  It just didn't seem to want to hang on, so I went ahead and decided to buy a replacement.  This is what I chose, and notably, I chose it for the color, just simply because I thought a white strap would look nice on a red and white guitar.  So far, it's given me no problems, and it looks very nice and functions perfectly.  This is a great bargain, too, since it's certainly not an expensive accessory.	1
Came brand new in package great overall.	1
Love this rosin	1
Absolutely fantastic, makes cheap bows and instruments sound sweet, very happy with product and shipping.	1
This rosin improved the "quality" of my bow!!!  One rosin may work better than another depending the bow, violin, player, and weather (and maybe the phase of the moon), so I bought a few different rosins to try (because they are inexpensive enough to try).  This way, I can try them in different weather too.  The Jade brand worked well for me too.	1
I love it! The looks and feel is awesome, and the price is right too. I will recommend this product to all my friends.	1
The best part about these straps is that the Leather doesn't get soft and fall off your guitar after awhile, like many other inexpensive straps and some straps that cost 10X more.	1
I have a couple of dark haired bows that I got this rosin for. it works very well, it seems to me. I am not a pro, i am a rooky so take it for what it's worth. I think it works and looks good.	1
I love the Dark Rosin.  Gives great tones.	1
This is a very high quality rosin that works great in winter time when there is less humidity and it is colder because of it's softness. Does not require much effort to get it onto the strings even if it hasn't been used in awhile. I would definitely recommend this to anyone in dryer cooler climates.	1
No sign of wear and tear. and the holes are really tight, minimizing the likelihood of the guitar breaking free occasionally (it never once came undone in all these months, not sth you can say about all guitar straps)	1
My local music store sells straps at the same price but are so cheap and poorly made that they break quickly. These are very well made, and the connectors are snug and made of thick leather-like material that holds my guitar well. Even after a couple of months worth of regular use, it's still holding up. If you're looking for a simple strap and don't want to spend much, you can't go wrong.	1
What you see is what you get. It's cheap, It's basic, and It works. The best thing about this synthetic product is the price, and color options!	1
good straps at good price!  Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product? Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 word	1
So perhaps I don't know what shade burgandy really is. Or the picture is a bit misleading. It is as stated, although the picture shows a criss cross pattern this is just woven. As too "DEE"s reveiw... the buckle doesn't seem to bother me. I am not calling him or her out or anything. My best guess, it's playing style. I myself play bass, when I first started I played on the 3" inch straps and found they bothered me, went to the 2" straps proplem solved. I am sure that at certain lengths it does become a bother. But for me and the way I play... No complaints.	1
GOOD DEAL	1
Awesome	1
never worked	1
If you want to tune each tension rod to the same torque this key is very useful. You dial in the specific max torque you desire and the grip will automatically click and open to let you know you've maxed out. I really like this tool to have around my kit.	1
I wanted some nice rosin for my new bow so I got this and it is great. It has lasted me a long time and works very well.	1
As good of rosin that I've ever had. I am not a rosin expert, but it scratches fine, gets on my bow fine, and makes my violin sound fine. Not Mozart quality yet, but I think that has more to do with me than the rosin.	1
This strap is value for money. I was surprised when I got it - I didn't expect something so good at this price! The material is shiny, blue and doesn't look cheap and the strap is generously wide. The ends are leather with one side having a golden EB logo. Goes well with my black Squier Strat. Highly recommended!	1
Very good strap. Fine quality. Your guitar will be fixed surely. Just one thing: that strap is too big for kids. So if you choose some kind of mini guitar, than you'd better to find something else. Else, this is a really good choise!	1
What can you say about a strap? It feels and looks like it's quality made, it's heavy duty. Supports my heavy bass better than previous straps that, while thrashing around while playing a gig, would break very easily and ruin the song. The forest green matches my bass, and it's comfortable. Also, it's pretty affordable.	1
My daughter says its way better than the light rosin she used to use	1
I really didn't expect this guitar strap to be anything more than what it is. It's tight knit nylon with leather to attach to the strap posts, It's not a super fancy top of the line guitar strap, but it serves it's purpose well. feels sturdy enough and it's adjustable for a man of any size. I ordered it on the 20th and received it on the 23rd, no complaints here. If you are like me and do not feel that it is necessary to spend 20$ or 30$ on a guitar strap then this would suit you just fine, for 6$ you can't beat it. buy one or 2 nothing to lose here	1
Works Great	1
Son and daughter liked this tool. It broke after 2 months of use. Son borrowed a school drum and it was to tight and snapped a piece of plastic knob. Now the torque part does not work the same. Told son it was his fault product was not designed for a over tightened nut.  He was bummed.	1
Did the work Perfect	1
Allows me to tune drum quickly and effectively, with ease. Very helpful for getting even tension across batter and resonant heads. Much less expensive than buying a tension dial.	1
Out of drum dials and all these different tuners on the market (which I've tried and used them all). I prefer this torque key. It is the best!	1
for the nice clean look for going to church, or every day freakout, this are for you. You might want to be drinking kool aid, might stain the strap, but worth it.	1
this makes the second one of this straps that I have ordered and I love them. They are longer than your standerd strap and that is great for a big guy like myself. I don't have not one bad thing to say. great buy and will do it again if I ever need anouther strap.	1
This strap works pretty good. Tight enough to hold guitar and cheap enough to save money. Design is simple and neat. I'm very satisfied	1
I ordered this for a new guitar, and for the price, I can't see how you can beat it. Nicer than one that came with another starter guitar I have. I wouldn't hesitate to order one of these again for another guitar.	1
Product does what you would think. I use it on my bass and haven't had a problem with it yet. If you are constantly playing shows, this may not be your first choice, but if you just need something to hold your guitar or bass up, then this is it. You can't beat the price.	1
All I use	1
Excellent	1
These rosin works as expected.	1
This strap holds my guitar just great.  My review must be at least 20 words long, so I hope this is enough.  Its a great strap, olive green goes nicely with my cherry Gibson sg-standard	1
I have both black and white Ernie ball straps, really comfortable, easy to adjust, holds guitar securely, and both colors look great with black guitars!	1
A good strap for 5 bucks with shipping. My guitar is a black Korean made LP style with gold hardware and bright white binding (like the black beauty). I was surprised to see how well the gold lettering matched my guitar. Overall satisfied.	1
Tighten the knob to it stops. That will be about the #4. That's the tightest it gets. It's a regular drum key at that point. Back it off to 9. That's your max torque. Back off to 0 from that point to "finger tighten".	1
Feels great in your hand. I still rely on my ear for tuning though.	1
The best tool I've used. So precise and consistent that save you a lot of effort tuning your drum set!	1
I hate to knock three starts out since I might have gotten a defective unit.  However, my experience with the Evans Torque key was not as positive as most of the other users. I followed the instructions very closely but was not able to get the key to actually lock in place even at the highest tension. With that said, as expected from evans, the key is built quite well and seems to be rugged to take some road beating. I might try another one in the future due to the many positive reviews, but until then I ended up biting the bullet and going with the Tune-bot which works perfectly.	-1
Does an excellent job.	1
My son loves this rosin better than any other one. I think because it's easy to hold while using it, and it doesn't brake into pieces like the more expensive ones that come with no outer holding box.	1
Its rosin is set in a wood block that makes apply it pretty easy this is far better that my last rosin.	1
I'm sure glad that I bought these straps, there not leather but are put together very well. I plan on using them as backups in the studio. The price was just right, cam quickly and I'd buy them again.	1
this is a great strap. nice tight fit, snug and secure and very flexible. Best part this strap gets long long long. Yep here it is.	1
Very good tool to use as a reference point for tuning drums and is very well constructed.	1
I really like this thing, but I never use it.	1
This is hands down, one of the best tools I've ever bought for my drums.  I use ALL kinds of different products for tuning and tensioning and measuring and tweaking... they're all much more expensive and THIS does the job so well, I don't think I could be happier with it.  I think I'm going to buy several more, just to make sure I've got one for my home kit, studio kit and gig kits at all times.	1
If you have a drum set, you need this. What a great invention this is. This is made very well and is very easy to use. When you get to the tension you want, the key snaps loose and you know you are done. It works like a torque wrench. I highly recommend this product.	1
Easy to use and I like the ability to set the torque adjustment for accurate torque.	1
Useful.  I like to use this to put new heads on and get the heads to be fairly close in pitch, then fine tune it from there.  I also prefer to use this as my main drum key because the handle is larger than the standard ones so it fits in my hand a little better.  However if you struggle to get drum tunings right, don't expect this to solve your problems.  You will still need to tune it by ear to get the pitch even all the way around.	1
Cool key! I find the numbers a little hard to read. but it will get you in the ball park really quick!	1
Works great!	1
I received this awhile back.  It came on time and I got what I wanted.  It works like any other strap.  It's not the best, but it does its job.	1
Good rosin. I use the same one for both my violin bow and my cello bow.	1
easy to use nice grip	1
Very beautiful product, I recommend it!	1
Got this rosin to use with a bow on a violin type instrument I built. Rosin is awesome. I use very fine sandpaper to rough up the surface after it's been sitting unused for a while.	1
Good quality, perfect for students	1
works great, seems to work perfectly (as I am a novice at the violin) I can only state that it worked very well for me	1
Rosin is rosin, I guess. Works great for me.	1
Fantastic	1
I've been using one of these for a couple of years and it's a big help. Two things that you have to remember though. Keep your drum clean, especially the tuning rods and lugs. If the rods bind while you're trying to tune then none of the tuning tools will work particularly well. Keep the threads on both clean and lubed. If the rods will turn easily then this thing works great! It gives you a good benchmark to get all of the rods at the same tension. You still have to fine tune using your ear but the Evans key really helps you to get to that point more quickly. Highly recommended.	1
Not slick as I would have liked	1
good!	1
Great product fast shipping	1
It's Rosin, it works and it's inexpensive. What's not to like?	1
A perfect fit for my 2018 Gibson LP Tribute	1
Excellent case. My bass fits perfectly inside. There are two "pockets" for holding strap or other loose gear and when the case is closed it completely covers them holding the loose stuff in place.  The internal padding actually compresses against the guitar with a tight fit. I'm sure that it will provide excellent protection against drops.  I'm actually thinking of switching my Fender Guitars over the Gator cases now.	1
I have three of these, two for my tele and strat, and the bigger one for my jazz bass. Quality product at a fair price.	1
This quality of this case amazed me.  I was very impressed. It fits my LP perfectly is very snug in the case and does not wiggle around. the inside is plush and protective.	1
This works pretty darn well. I'm impressed. I was ready to pull the $60 trigger, but this does fine. I'm very well trained at tuning my drums by hear, but this is a good tool to speed up that process. I don't need crazy-stupid accuracy, just close enough, and this gets it closer than I thought it would. I recommend a good drum hardware cleanup day, though. I put brand new nylon washers on all my rods, and greased up the threads so they turn smoothly. This enables much better accuracy from the Evans Torque Key.	1
Handy little tool, well made, easy to use.	1
Works great. I was going to spend much more money on a drum tuner, because i really don't know what i'm doing with tuning drums. I'm glad I bought this piece of gear for under 20 bucks. I was able to figure it out pretty quick and now my snare drum sounds way better with no guess work. You still have to methodically go around the drum and tune the lugs in "star order", but the end results are a proper sounding drum ... despite not knowing what i'm doing. super pleased.	1
Well made & effective for fine tuning!	1
Works Great!	1
This thing has been an awesome addition. No more guessing, every nut exactly the same now.	1
Good quality product.	1
ok rosin - as good as my expensive rosin.	1
Excellent	1
great	1
It is a bit flimsy, but it is priced right.	1
Fantastic case for the price. Got it to fit a Rickenbacker 4003 used that I got without a case. Good quality - as good as the original Ric case which is over 2 times this price.	1
Nice fit and finish. My P-bass fits great. It looks like it will hold up well.	1
Light weight and sturdy. Sleek and cool. I love mine. You should get one.	1
OUTSTANDING quality!!!	1
Works fine. To tell you the truth, I've used a bunch of different rosins and I really can't tell much difference between them.	1
Great rosin!!!!	1
Rosin is rosin, unless, perhaps you are a highly paid symphony orchestra professional musician where your inside knowledge is something you treasure.  This product is convenient for the average player, it being imbedded in a wooden handling block and should last the weekend fiddler about 100 years.  I still have a similar block that I've used off and on for about 75 and it still produces enough dust to leave a little cloud with vigorous playing.  Of course, I'm only a slightly better sawer than I was as a 10-yr.-old.  Huh, wonder if my choice of bow grabber has been holding me back?	1
strat fits great inside	1
Bought for a Dean Thoroughbred single cut.  Fit was good.  Solid quality case.	1
I was reluctant to pay more than a hundred dollars for a case like this, especially since there are hard cases you can get for around $60. I own one of those $60 cases. And now I own one of the Gator cases, too. No comparison. This case is lighter, smaller, fits my bass better (Warwick Corvette 5-string). Totally worth it. This is the third Gator case I have. I've got a 2-u rack case, a pedal board bag, and this bass guitar case. All are great. Buy this.	1
The case is a decent quality ABS shell with aluminum valence, suitable for light-duty gigging work. It contains horrendously awful polystyrene as the support material. [I absolutely hate Styrofoam, since it is chemically reactive, heat-sensitive, easily-pierced, brittle and permanently deforms on contact. I order a lot via mail-order, and it's the bane of my existence, since its painfully obvious inability to protect anything is the #1 reason for shipping damage. Yet I can't hold Gator accountable here, since polystyrene is the de facto standard support material--even in expensive guitar cases.]  The case has a major flaw: it doesn't include recesses for the strap buttons. Therefore the neck sticks up in the air when a SG is placed in the case, and closing the case puts pressure on the neck.  Those of you who own classic Gibson guitars sound off here. What's the weakest, most broken part of a vintage Gibson? Yup! The neck.	-1
I reviewed several cases at the local guitar stores and nothing was sticking out as a great buy. Some were crazy expensive. Some were not built well. Some were not built well and crazy expensive. This case seems to be the right mix of quality and price.	1
I have had the BF-3 for many years, among over 50 other stompboxes (including a bunch of different phasers, flangers, choruses, vibratos, tremolos, and ring modulators).  The BF-3 is one of my top 3 favorites.  This thingy has awesome flanging tones, which can be set to heavy psychedelic sounds or tamed for more classy tones.  With some tweaking of the knobs, the BF-3 can sit in for pretty much any modulation application.  It covers flanger, phaser, chorus, vibrato, tremolo, and ring modulator territory.  If someone needs to own one modulation pedal, this is it.	1
This pedal is an essential addition to any players pedal board. I recently added it and wondered what took me so long.  It exceded my expectations.  This is an awesome pedal!  I have 9 pedals and 8 are Boss.  I guess that would suggest Boss makes a fine product :-)  Get one, you won't regret it.	1
This is a great case for the money.  My Ibanez 5 string fits perfectly, and a peavey 5 string fit as well, though a little snug.  No issues.	1
Works as it should !!!	1
Greatly improved my tuning speed. Honestly, I hate tuning. I have a difficult time with it as is, and my fusion Tama birch kit is difficult to tune properly. With this thing though, at least I know each drum is uniform, and I finally dialed in the right tuning for my kit. A must have if you are lazy or really don't like tuning.	1
Used a small file to rough it up, works great!!	1
Little heavy, but good rosin	1
My rosin arrived today securely and carefully packaged. I used it on a new bow I also received today from another seller. It works beautifully. I specifically bought the dark rosin because it is a softer rosin. Perfect for the cold winter months. I also have the light rosin from a previous order. Very pleased with this purchase.	1
This is some very good rosin.  It doesn't seem quite as "dusty" as others I've used.  It helps a rather cheap bow my son uses sound a bit better and softer.  Get some.  Enjoy it.	1
Excellent case for the money. It protects my bass way more than a soft gig bag.	1
VERY GOOD CASE,AND VERY WELL BUILT,IT IS VERY STRONG,HIGHLEY RECOMENED	1
good	1
Fantastic case. This fit my guitar perfectly and I like it better than the original case.	1
Not bad - fits my G&L ASAT classic, but not my Jazzmaster. It is quite a bit bigger then a regular strat/tele style case. I've got a few gator cases for various axes, and they work well, nothing earth shattering.	1
As with any Boss pedal, it does what you want it to do.	1
Nice flanger.	1
Not a true pass-through. So noisy when turned off its not usable in my chain.	-1
it's a very straight forward flanger pedal (if there's such a thing haha), sure, it takes a bit of practice to find the sounds and tones you were looking for, but trust me, they're there. 100% recommended. and remember, you'll need a ac adapter (i bought a few boss psa-120s, just just fine).	1
It's a Boss.. I'm not a fan of flangers but I got this to complete my twelve pedal, all Boss pedalboard. I'm a Boss pedal collector. And I'm very satisfied with the sound. I can create as close as possible the sounds of famous guitarists by using  Boss pedals. I like buying them in slightly used condition. It's cheaper and works as good as new. Very satisfied with all my Boss pedalboard setups.	1
I was looking for a flange pedal that had to be a stomp box and I'm definitely not disappointed. It sounds great and like all the Boss pedals it's built like a tank. Great range of flange and incredibly reliable.	1
I special orderd a Boss BF-3 Flanger from Guitar Center. I kept it 2 weeks & took it back. This pedal sucked: EXTREMELY metallic sounding & the Flanging was not pronounced enough. I was shocked because in the 1980's I used a Boss BF-2 Flanger that was pretty darn good. I then tried a Hartman Flanger. Great effect, just a HUGE volume bump when tuned on. I dumped The Hartman & went for the "absolute kabala" of Flangers. I went out & bought a REAL Flanger: The ADA Flanger.	-1
works great I give'th a five	1
I bought this for my Les Paul, and it fits right, protects well and does all of what a case should.  Not a flight case by any means, but fine for knocking around in a van and such.	1
This is an awesome case! It fits my guitar perfectly and is well constructed! I would by it again if I needed another.	1
Great.	1
A great case for the price, I have 3 of them and use them regularly. Not heavy enough for flight but great in the car or back of the van.	1
This case seems well made. I've used Gator cases on other items and they have done a great job for me. I bought this case for an Epiphone SG Special and the lower part of the body is a little larger than the padding of the case, but I gently pushed down on the guitar and it went right in. so far so good on this item.	1
Fits my custom Telecaster great.  Great basic case. Offers good protection.	1
This case is especially great for my application.  I ordered this for a G&L Legacy guitar and it's a perfect fit!  The case is made in China, but the quality is very good and the molded length-long bumpers on the top and bottom increase the strength of the case.  My guitar will be well-protected.  G&L guitars require a longer case than standard for a Fender.  This Gator case is made for a straight-through fit and the neck rest matches perfectly to the G&L neck.	1
These are on a Silver Bell banjo which was made in the 1930's.  It is being fixed up and Martin Strings are excellent.  Highly recommend seller and product	1
They work, they are strings for a banjo, they make a twang sound when plucked or strummed, they are shiny out of the package. Yup, yay banjo strings!	1
A****	1
This is an excellent, easy playing mouthpiece for classical saxophone playing.  Even though this is the largest opening for this model (AL5), it's still relative small compared to other mouthpieces, and required a jump up to a stronger reed (Hemke 3).  But even with that, it plays great.  I have purchased and played many mouthpieces in the last few years (Vandoren, Selmer, Meyer, Rico, and Otto Link) and can say that this is the best playing of the bunch. Very even throughout the entire range, with excellent altissimo response.  Have played it on both  Selmer Mark VI and newer AS42, and sounds good on both.	1
Well balanced, classical mouthpiece.  I had tried many others until giving this one a blow, and fell in love.  It is rather free-blowing, definitely not as much so as a Yamaha 4c....but its resistance helps contribute to your further control of the sound.  The tone is also of a pure quality.  I love this mouthpiece, and highly recommend it for classical playing or as an upgrade to a pro mouthpiece from something like a 4c.  I have played on the 4c,S80,Meyer 6HR,Rousseau NC, Rousseau JDX5(also love this for a Jazz mouthpiece/nice contrast to the AL3).	1
Excellent work, both amazon and seller, exact arrival, great quality of the product and fit exactly as indicated by the measurement. 5 stars.	1
What can I say. its a string	1
Great	1
This was OK, but you can do even better on cost and shipping.  Do a search.	1
Ok these are great strings depending on how often you play will determine how long they last but quality strings over all	1
I got tired of having tons of Slinky packs with 9s taken out of them so I finally broke down and bought a bulk pack of 9s! It doesn't matter what guitar I play, I snap the high E string. So it's a no-brainer for me! I should go up to 10s probably, but I'm an old school 9s guy!	1
Violin Rosin for my granddaughters violin. it works as well as any other rosin we have used.	1
good	1
A good product at a great price, and a must for your bow.	1
fantastic case, fits my Jaguar bass well.	1
pretty nice quality. have no doubt it will protect my bass well.	1
This is a good quality guitar case in a long form for my Ibanez 8 String.	1
came  on time works great	1
In the past I've always tuned by ear but I got curious and tried this torque key out.  First off, a lot of people say that these torque keys don't work.  I'll admit, generally, that CAN be true.  If your lugs are older or aren't oiled/greased up then it can quickly throw off the measurements that this key gives you.  That being said, if you do some TLC to your drums and keep things in good working order, this key can save you a ton of time.  So this is what I did when using the torque key.  As always, hand tighten all your lugs  Then you set torque key.  The settings go from 0-9.  Once  you pass 9 and go back to 0 you are essentially at "10".  I found the highest I could move the dial was to about 19.  Also, there are about 4 clicks in between each number so you can really fine tune the torque that you want.  From here, just like the instructions say, set the torque to a low number (I started around 6) and tune your lugs and test your drum.  If you like the sound, you're good.  If not, tighten up the torque and go again.  Once you get your batter side right, I tuned the torque down 2-3 clicks and used that as my torque for the reso heads.  Once I had a baseline for all my drums, I put the whole kit together and played and fine turned with a standard drum key.  All in all I did my 6 piece drum set in about 45 minutes.	1
Recommended by my teacher, I am a beginner and with the one included with my sax I could not make a sound, this one helped me to position my mouth and sounds come left and right.	1
It costs a little extra, but worth the money. Helps produce a nice rich sound.	1
High quality got A 3 tenor and a 4 alto	1
Fits my Tele really well. About 1/2 inch to spare lengthwise. Not the most heavy duty thing out there but definitely a step up from gig bag.	1
Gator makes very good gear.	1
everyone should have these...	1
Ernie Ball, what's not to like?	1
good product, quick delivery	1
I changed my string gauges on a new guitar so I use 9's instead of 10's for the E string	1
Took a while to ship.  Looking forward to trying them.  My first Martin banjo strings.  Let's see if they live up to the Ines on my guitar.	1
Great strings for an old Vega Ranger customized banjo.	1
Cheap strings, but work fine. I have no complaints whatsoever.	1
Good string great value	1
Good product, kids like it.	1
good quality.	1
Fast Deliver/Good Product	1
As with every other Gator product I own or, have ever owned, it's top notch.  A good, solid case at a reasonable price.  It fits my '96 MIK Les Paul Standard Plus Top perfectly.  The guitar doesn't move around at all with the lid open.  And it fits perfectly with the lid closed too.  All the valences line up as they should.  I bought a refurbished case and it comes complete with factory tags and warranty info.  I looked the case over carefully and checked all the hardware.  I can't find a mark, defect or potential future problem(s) anywhere.  It's looks like a brand new case but, at about 40% less.  Very satisfied with both the case and the price.	1
Very VERY snug fit, but you squeeze that sucker in there and its not going anywhere.. cool case	1
aloha from hawaii!  it's 2015 and after 58 years, my '57 Fender P-Bass has a new case! the Fender P-Bass fits like a charm!	1
This is a very sturdy looking case, and not as heavy to carry as some other bass cases.  It has bigger outside dimensions than many cases which makes it a little awkward  to carry at times.	1
I use mostly Ernie Ball strings. These are Ernie Ball strings. I like Ernie Ball strings. I like these.	1
My husband likes this brand of strings and at such a great price we usually order multiples	1
great replacements !!!	1
Just as described, they work great!!	1
Easy to use and reasonably priced.  Yes, it may not for precision tunig but it does a job well.  Must for my gig.	1
Works perfectly, makes tuning your drums the same way each time much easier. Terrific purchase and i would buy it again.	1
Be cautious if you have suspension mounted toms. You can make it work if you flip them upside down........it isn't a huge deal. I did notice I am missing the angle of having it the correct way as the mic is a little higher but, like I said, not a huge deal. On a typical kit, these rock, buy buy buy!!!	1
badass design and quick shipping	1
This is the best mic clip out there. with the goose neck you have much more flexability to position the mic anywhere you want. this is really helpful in tight set ups.  you can extent the arm or lower it as well as bend the arm to put the mic right where you want it.	1
Great product works great. holds the mic in a compact style. The clip is very easy to mount on the drum rim.	1
Good strings at a fair price, always have extra for backup.	1
We stock up on these strings regularly, they give such a clean, crisp and true sound and I've been using them for years.	1
Sound better than I can play!	1
Strings are 2" too short.	-1
quality  product .on time delivery	1
Excellent case..Very durable..has locks with keys..	1
EXCELLENT ITEM  THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY SON AND IT FITS LIKE A GLOVE FOR HIS LES PAUL.  MUCH MUCH CHEAPER THAN SOMEHTING WITH THE GIBSON NAME ON IT.	1
Fantastic cases for the money!! Not quite as well made as the one my Mom bought me 10 years ago, but plenty good for my needs.  I would order another one if needed.	1
Was dried out and crumbled.	-1
EXCELLENT PRODUCT...	1
Works great!	1
product was as advertised and very prompt delivery.	1
Violin teachers say that the round rosin is better. But, the round one that came with my violin is too hard. I rosined the bow for quite a while and could hardly get any sound out of the violin. I ordered and used this one....just a few strokes and the violin started sounding.	1
I switched to .009 strings at the recommendation of my guitar teacher. I've learned the hard way to keep extra "E" strings because these thinner strings break rather often if you are wailing away on the guitar.	1
The Ernie Balls, especially these plain sets, unravel on me FROM THE BALL END when you use them the first time of tuning up. It has happened to me over and over again. It is the way they are finished at the ends. This has been happening to me whether I buy them through Amazon or the Guitar Center. They start slipping and detuning and eventually pull out or break. They also break easily if they don't have the unravelling problem. This will happen one or two times a six-pack. It also happens on regular sets. I won't buy Ernie Balls anymore.	-1
the gauge is pretty small so these strings break a lot.  So stocking up with a 6 pack is perfect.	1
I have used in the past great product I would recommend to any one changing of their instrument look  JRAD.	1
I keep breaking my 9's. This bag of 9's is a life saver and a money saver. I don't have to bust open a new bag of full sets each time.	1
I got this case for my Epiphone Les Paul Special Edition II. The guitar fits in the case like a glove! The interior of the case is shaped like the LP, which was a good surprise - as it seems different in the product pictures. The case is very light, but is made of good material and I believe it will protect the guitar very well. The internal pocket is not too big, but it should be enough to carry guitar strap, tuner, picks and capo...	1
I was surprised by the quality, of course I shouldn't be; it's a Gator Case! My Ibanez SDGR fits in here snugly without any movement. The room for peripherals is very nice.	1
Works great! Thank you!	1
good for doing small increases	1
It's pretty cool,works good for the small price. You can get your drum in range and evenly tuned. I am not of the ilk, however, of the idea of getting  over technical that I feel that drums need some computerized tuning or something. It's by ear and feel (I remember a story about Buddy Rich getting annoyed at a guy for adjusting the wrinkle out of the outer head of his kit because he thought that the wrinkle looked bad, and Buddy said " that WAS the  best bass drum sound I've had in a long time")... Anyhow, this thing works pretty simply and well. You set it where you want and it clicks when it gets there.	1
Excellent product, very happy with it	1
A++++ item as pictured. Does what it is supposed to do. Recommended!	1
Good	1
The violin I bought came with some really cheap rosin that I couldn't even try to use, so I bought this and it works great! I'm not exactly an expert at comparing rosins, but this worked good for me and I'd get it again if I ever need it!	1
I like this rosin as I can get a soft melodic sound even when using a mute.  Lasts about as long as harder rosins and I don't seem to get as much dust build-up, maybe because it's lighter? Have recomended and loaned this to many of my friends that play.	1
Purchased for a PRS Se Paul Allender model.  Well made, solid and the guitar fits in well and padding/measurements keep the guitar in place.	1
Case cracks easily	-1
Great case. Telecaster fits perfect. Expected a bit bigger compartments, but its still enough to put basic things inside. There is a bit of space under guitar head where you can also store stuff, such as pedal, but make sure to secure it.  Outside material is heavy. Hard plastic and looks nice at same time. Locks are good as well, simple opening.	1
This is a great case!  Now I can store my Hello Kitty Collector's Edition strat safe and sound in my basement.  See the pics for yourselves.  A tight fit but it does the job just fine, protecting my(your) precious guitar.	1
Nice.	1
Well made and solid. Great value. It will keep your "baby" safe and comfortable. My Guild B-302F fits perfectly inside the plush interior.	1
I just received the AL3 today, and was worried it would be difficult to transition from the Rascher mouthpiece that I had used since about 1963 (no kidding).  My current horn is a Yanagisawa 991 alto.  I needn't have worried.  From the first notes I played, it was clear that the AL3 is a big improvement.  The horn is easier to play and has great classical tone quality.  I recently tried a Selmer C* in a local shop, but found it hard to blow and control.  Same problem with the Yanagisawa mouthpiece that came with the horn. I'm also using a Rovner Versa ligature and Vandoren traditional #3 reeds.  These are working great with the AL3.  My horn is now easier to play and sounds better too, with the Vandoren AL3.	1
A bit pricey but I definitely can hear the difference with the sound quality.	1
Great case and PERFECT fit for my 2010 Gibson Les Paul Traditional.  Seems like the same quality as my factory Martin case and factory Fender case.	1
Great for the price. It brought home a Les Paul safely via mail, and continues to keep it secured. Great buy.	1
A must for all those Les Paul Owners who still go around on Gig Bags!!! It keeps my Gibson Les Paul Studio safe during day aftet day of gigs and multiple car trunks.	1
Easily applies to the bow I just love it and the price is right! :) Think I will buy more and share with my daughter.  Thank You!	1
This was really nice. had a pro player use some of this and he liked it. told me to buy more for people that I do set ups for.	1
Using it for my school kid's violin. I'm no expert, but I can tell a big difference after applying it. It's not just a matter of rubbing on the bow. You have to scratch it first with something a bit hard to bring out some powder, then you rub it on. Good price.	1
The price is so little i feel that it simply can't be beat. This is my favorite rosin, i have tried the same brand but in the dark version and it just didn't feel as nice as the light.  I was originally using the rosin that came with my violin (which i need to destroy) and i will never, ever do that again. This rosin is infinitely better and actually stays on the bow. The fallout is very fine and very little, i can usually just blow it off gently.	1
Since this is our first violin ever, we may not be the ideal people to review this item.  That said, it went on great, and made the violin sound just fine.  Great product!	1
bought this for my budding violinist.  (5 year old).  handy having it in the wood case for little fingers who are just learning how to use it.	1
I like them , good sticks . But I prefer the ?uestlove sticks . But these are awesome too . I just wished they were longer .	1
Great case, excellent quality and good price.  Holds a Fender Jazz bass very well.  So far has been durable.  I highly recommend this case!	1
Great LP Case, awesome price, case is a bit ugl. but offers three times the protection of a Gibson case.	1
wrk very well,jut make sure you always clean your strings after your done playing,very happy with this product,shipping was fast	1
I bought this on the strength of the reviews here, and am glad I did.  Using this with my Yamaha YAS-62 pro alto, it produces warm, strong tones and greatly improved playability compared to my other mouthpieces.  When it comes to sax mps, it's a good idea to experiment with a handful of different mouthpieces and different reeds.  I'm using this with Vandoren 3 Java reds&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Vandoren-Java-Red-Alto-Saxophone-Reeds-3-Box-of-10/dp/B0027LYW5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Vandoren Java Red Alto Saxophone Reeds #3, Box of 10</a>&nbsp;and it sounds terrific.  Easier to play low notes; plus something I especially like is I can get clear strong tones on my high D/E/F/F# that's better than anything else I've used.  I've played this alto for over 30 years, it never sounded better, than with this Vandoren A3 mp w/Red java 3 Vandoren reeds.  Initially I held off because I'm used to playing mps from classic mp producers, many of which are outstanding.  With a smooth, balanced, open tone, this produces well at all ends of the playing range, which is extremely important.  Most mps are good at easy mid-tone production, what separates mouthpiece (and sax) quality, is that it's often harder to produce clear tones at low sub-low D (for low C/B/Bb) and high above high-D tones, this mouthpiece solves that and makes playing across the entire range easier.  Another plus is how easy it is to play using 3-strength reeds, with no chirps/squawks/hard pressure. I've typically used 2 1/2 reeds for decades, because of problems using 3s on my other mps.  This AL3 makes using 3s as easy as using 2 1/2s, which alone makes it worth getting, since 3s are better to play with.  Pleasantly surprised, this is one of the better music-related buy decisions I've made; highly recommended for both new and us veteran horn players.  Thanks Vandoren - you guys got it right. Much appreciated.  Now I'm off to play classic jazz...( I like Bird, Trane, Desmond)  - Ken	1
Buy it! Tunes drums!	1
It's not 100 percent accurate.  It all depends on how smooth the travel is on your tuning lugs.  A little bit of rust will throw you off a little.  I still give it 5 stars because this is a problem for ALL torque keys.  A little cleaning on your lugs though (I soaked them in coke and then gave them a little scrub with wire-wool) and a dab of Vaseline and it really helps.  This key gets you close enough to make the final adjustments in your tuning.  Saves a bunch of time at gig time. Also, with Evan's 360 heads, you can probably get away with just using this thing.  Those heads are pretty forgiving if you're in a hurry.	1
This key helps in the final touch of the drums, is very good I recommend her	1
THIS BABY KICKS ASS!!! Solid beyond belief. AND... it holds my Kona KE5BSB Jazz Bass Style 5-String Electric Guitar beautifully!!! Hmm. maybe it can even be used to house your mother-in-law when she visits!!! :-)	1
I've got six of these cases for various guitars, including Strats, Variaxes, PRS Custom 22 SE and PRS Custom 24 SE. I was even able to fit my PRS 245 SE into one, although it was initially a tight fit width-wise. (The rigid foam compressed enough to allow the guitar to fit.) Excellent bang for the buck, and I've had absolutely no problems with any of them. I play out regularly, and usually take 5 guitars with me to gigs, and these cases have held up very well, showing virtually no signs of wear.	1
There is nothing like super cool drumsticks...and these ones are on the top of our list !!!!	1
These sticks are what's up.  They have a really unique groove at the fulcrum and are also dipped in Zildjan's version of stick grip.  They feel like 7As with a acorn wood tip.  Nice for jazz and light funk.	1
These are my husband's favorite sticks! He plays with them every week for our worship band. Comfortable grip, great sound. The first set we bought (from a store) held up a long time. The second set (from this seller) did not. Might have been a faulty pair? The third pair (from this seller) are holding up just fine so far after a few months. If they break early, I will change my rating. But for now, these are still his favorite sticks!  And the price we got them for was a steal. Ordered twice, definitely will order again.	1
very very nice product	1
works well for viola. easy to score and easy to apply. lasts a good while with all the practicing required.	1
Of your lugs are clean and lubed this is an accurate tool. If anything is gives you a great reference point.	1
I see why some people don't love this.  Adjusting it for each drum is a bit of a pain.  It's not incredibly expensive, so I gave it a shot.  I have it set for my snare and basically use it for a rapid check on the tuning when I sit down to play and periodically while playing.  For that use, I am very happy with it.  But if I were to do that for my toms - well it would be a pain!  I have a drum dial, which I use when changing tom and kick skins.  I also dabble with an iPhone app much like TuneBot.  They aren't perfect, but workable.	1
Gets tuning real close, great for beginners like me.	1
The key is great so far. I had seen some questionable reviews, but I have yet to see a problem. Works great for me and it makes it pretty quick to tune. The extra length can throw you off when your used to the standard keys.	1
Works as advertised.  It takes a little of the guesswork out of tightening skins.  I would like to see it capable of measured higher torque.  Maybe I just have all my heads on too tight?!  The torque key seems to be very well made......good price for a good product.	1
I think this is a tool to get those loose ends tightened.  The clutch is okay but only time will tell its longevity.	1
Ok, so I went for the "Vintage look and bought a "Gibson" & a "Fender" guitar strap!  When I was younger I would never have made the purchase - I would have to have a big wide black leather strap throw in some silver bling....now that I am 54, almost, I need the name spelled out to remind me which is which.  Not a expensive all leather constructed strap, but it gets the job done & in my refined age, I think it looks bitchin!	1
I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase and bought two of these.  One for my Gibson Les Paul and the other for my Epiphone Les Paul. My local music store was all out of these and wanted me to pay 39.95 each to order them, I bought them here for 13 bucks a piece. Both of my guitars are mainly Red so these match perfectly.  I was delighted at the quality of them.  They are much thicker and heavier than I expected and stay put on the guitars.  I would definitely purchase more of these when I buy more Gibsons. I have my eyes on the Gibson B B King Lucille Model when I can come up with the 3500 to purchase it and would put one of these on it too if they make them in Black or Gold. These straps are easy to adjust and stay adjusted to the length you want.  Some straps slip, not these. I would recommend buying these if you're in the market fro a guitar strap for your Gibson or Epiphone, you won't regret it unless you're expected something they're not.  If they are good enough for my Les Paul or Lucille "hopefully", they're good enough for about anything.  I'm not sure about the other comments about locking them on because from what I can see, they stay put but I suppose better safe than sorry.  I won't lock them on though.  I have some Fender straps ordered for my Strats and hope they are as nice as these, we'll see..	1
I got this case to carry an Oscar Schmidt single cutaway (Les Paul copy). It fits great, and seems plenty robust to me. I have 5 or 6 other molded Roadrunner cases for various guitars, and I've been happy with all of them.	1
I checked these out at a local music store and had to get a pair. Thus far I am not disappointed in the least. These are a little thicker in diameter than the sticks I had been using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Promark-TXJZN-American-Hickory-Jazz-Nylon-Tip-Single-Pair/dp/B000XZWYCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Promark TXJZN American Hickory Jazz Nylon Tip, Single Pair</a>, but felt immediately comfortable.  The length is my preferred 16 inches (the same as my Promark sticks), but these are .550 in diameter versus .512 for the Promark. Surprisingly they feel about the same, but that may be because of the dip style handle. And the handle is what I love (so far, anyway). It gives me the balance point close to what I am accustomed to, and the overall stick design gives excellent rebound. Do be aware that I play exclusively traditional grip, so I cannot provide any opinions for match grip players.  In two places above I hedged with terms like 'so far'. That is because I have not had these long enough to provide an assessment based on long term use. While the design of the dip handle will prevent sticks from flying out of your hands even if you are gripping them super loose, there may be issues with blisters from prolonged use. I have given them a good workout and have not experienced any ill effects though, and am both hopeful and optimistic.  One final note: the tip design sounds fantastic on cymbals (what one would expect from Zildjian), as well as on calf heads (which I use most of the time.)	1
I ordered the Gator GC-LPS Deluxe Molded Case for Single-Cutaway Electric Guitar used through Amazon warehouse Unfortunately, I had to return it.  The aluminum trim along the guitar body was unattached but six or so inches.  I was able to return it shipping pre-paid by Amazon, so kudos and a shout out to them.  I was not given the option to replace the case.  I was just given a refund for obvious reasons. That being said, I'm not taking stars off for that.  Well,.. maybe half a star.    For the price, its an o.k. guitar case.  As one one of the reviewers put it, "Its a good case, not a great case".  If you're looking for a flight case or something to take on gigs, I'd suggest spending way more something sturdier. The shell is o.k.and will protect your "baby" from minor falls or bumps.  The foam and liner are o.k., I believe in one of the pics, it shows recesses for the switch and the strings.  The case I received did not have that foam configuration and the main reason that I took off a star. I hope this helps.   Cheers!  P.S.  The Dean Deceiver F does fit in this case with the whammy bar removed.  I did not try it with the whammy bar attachedl	1
I like the case a lot. The guitar case fits different body styles and is very strong.  I can use it for more than one guitar.	1
Good quality and will probably last a long time with weekly house-to-church use. However, touring bass players will likely need something sturdier. My Fender Jazz bass fits in this case perfectly. I bought it on sale with free shipping - a good score.	1
This Gator Case is very good, I'm use with a fender stratto and it is fit perfectly on this one.	1
It's a pretty nice case.  It fits all four of my Les Pauls, so that's a start.  The construction appears to be pretty good.  The latches all work properly and the metal edging fits together properly.	1
I bought this for my Dean Edge 4, which fits perfectly in it.  (As an aside, my Fender Jazz and Edge 9 don't fit - but that's not why I bought this case).  It is lightweight and durable enough to protect against anything I might let happen.  I cannot ask for more.  For the price, I would buy it again.	1
It is fairly well constructed for the cost, and my strat fits in tightly after the vib/lever is removed. However, I'm a bit disappointed with the so-called storage compartment: it cannot hold all my accessories, nor does it have an independent lid to stop the items from sliding around the case (so I have to stuff a towel over the compartment to hold stuff in).	1
I love my Spring Kings reverb. Despite what some have said, can be loud and crazy, or beautiful and subtle. I play a lot of older music (rockabilly and Beatles) and it works great for me! I would highly recommend this reverb unit. Its awesome!	1
Just purchased a Mesa TA 15 to replace my Express25 (which I love). No spring verb on the TA15 and I just cannot fit digital reverbs into my tone.  This unit is not bad and for me wanting just a taste of reverb it is great as I also use a delay at various settings. Good for clean sounds and blues; who cares when sustain and dirt is at 11.  Boogie plays well with it which is not always the case.  OK with both HH and SSS.	1
Good grip	1
These sticks feel wonderful in the hand.	1
These are my go to sticks. I gave a set to my buddy and he loves them as well. Very thin and agile. However, they are rather fragile and do not last too long, especially the heads.	1
These had the potential to be my favorite pair of sticks. They have great balance and the grip recess is a marvel of control.  Unfortunately, they used an inferior grade of wood and the tips began to chip after only a few plays. Regarding the comments about the rubber creating blisters, that is only a problem if you grip these very tightly.  Back off a little and let them float and they just hang in perfectly. They also have a problem with the painted tips leaving marks all over your heads and cymbals.  They became completely unusable due to the broken tips.  They should leave the tips unpainted with a neutral treatment and use a different wood.  I would be happy to try an improved model maybe with nylon tips?	-1
broke in the center after an hour of normal use on an electronic kit.  Super lame.  I also got a terrible blister because of the rubber, I am a seasoned drummer and my hands are strong but the rubber just rubs me the wrong way..........	-1
These are my favorite sticks so far. Nice and light weight. The dip is awesome.	1
Works fine very comfortable	1
Feels great, shipped quick, I like it	1
Very good	1
I tune by ear and then take a reading with this torque key. I can then use the value of one of the tuning pegs and turn all of them to match that one. It has worked well for me. You can tune the batter head and then tune the other head looser. I use a star pattern when I check tightness. This assures even torque.	1
this does what it describes, sort of. it sees to it that it will "click" when it reaches the same amount of tension. this will tune your drumheads evenly IF your lugs / rods are all new and clean. i've got a set of '65 ludwig clubdates, where a few of the lugs are a bit rusty- so this will always feel more resistance sooner on those lugs. if you identify (at this point, i know all of the 'problem lugs') this problem this can and does help make tuning a lot easier. for the price, its worth having around.	1
Just like I said in the title, this is great for an initial, equal, torque before tuning, but nothing more really.	1
are hard to beat when it comes to durability. (except the steel ones).  I use it when I travel on a plane especially	1
Just what you would expect from a quality case: it's the ultimate protection for your base. Hard shell on the outside with velvety padding inside. Just enough room for some books, cables, maybe a footstool. Worth the price if you like your instrument to stay intact.	1
Not as solid as I wanted it to be but great for the price. It did the job, which was to protect my bass guitar on a plane trip. Fast delivery.	1
Wow these sticks are great! The lathed area where your finger meets the thumb is perfect! I use these for classic rock/hard rock and they can withstand abuse. I have not broken one yet and the coating last quite a while...and the grip dip is awesome! Love these sticks!	1
When one of the worlds finest drummers designs a drumstick, you get one of the worlds finest drumsticks!!!	1
These are the best sticks I have owned.  Love the feel and the innovative design.  After using these, my other sticks seem archaic.	1
A customer was nice enough to measure one of these and told me that the length was 50 inches at max. extension but I bought one anyway. It can not be used with any acoustic guitar or semi hollow body like an ES 335 or and other guitar (like a Gibson SG) that has a strap button attached to the center of the body near the place where the neck attaches. The strap is just too short. It works fine on a Gibson Les Paul if you are of average stature or play your guitar high up and probably on most guitars with the strap button mounted to the upper base bout like a Fender. If you have a bass guitar I would look for a different strap as well.  I don't know why Gibson would make a product that is unusable on over half of their product line of guitars. Oh, and by the way the strap is pretty.	-1
bought this as an impulse item, an add on to avoid shipping charges on another order.  I am very glad I chose it- good heavy quality and bright contrasting color makes it a great addition to my Gibson Songwriter	1
I have quite a few Gibsons and this strap goes along with the "theme". Appears to be well made. I'd buy another..	1
It's very easy, quick, and accurate to use. Love this torque key. This is high quality product and worth the price.	1
Another drummers must have in their bag of tools for drumheads. Like how you can keep it set to maintain a constant tuning any time you need to tune up your drums.	1
Nothing is going to tune your drum perfectly other than your ears and some practice, but I wouldn't change a head without this key.  Having all the tension rods at about the same tension makes doing the final tuning MUCH easier.  That said, you need to be careful using this key, and there's a trick that may help you. Here's what I do. After you put a new head on, tighten all the rods until they just touch the hoop. Then finger tighten them all about the same amount. Now start with the torque key at a very low level, and go around the lugs at least twice in your normal tuning pattern.  Tighten the key, and repeat.  Do this until you get close to the pitch you want, going around your lug pattern at least twice at each tension.  And here's the trick.  Once you are close to pitch, because static friction is greater than dynamic friction, it helps if you loosen the tension rod 1/16 or 1/8 of a turn before tightening them.  If you do this, breaking the friction before tightening, you'll find that all of a sudden one or two rods will turn another 1/8 or 1/4 of turn, and suddenly all the others will move a little more to.  Using that trick, this little toy can get each lug to within 1 or 2 Hz of each other while you watch music videos, sports, or your favorite TV show.  All that is left is to fine tune a little bit, but you'll probably have to turn of the TV for that part.  One more thing, like another reviewer said, if you have rusty or dirty threads on the tension rods, all bets are off, because it will take more torque to get the same tension on the rods.	1
This tool saves me time and makes it easier and quicker to tune my drums.  It will NOT tune your drums for you nor is it in any way a substitute for traditional tuning.  What it will do is FACILITATE your tuning efforts.  First, and foremost, and this is mandatory.  You MUST lubricate your lugs.  I use Lug Lube but any lightweight non-graphite oil will work.  If you fail to do this then this tool is of less value since any rusty or sticky lugs will have more resistance than others, defeating the purpose of the tool. Second, the tool is NOT precise.  It does however get you close very quickly.  It makes for a quick starting point.  It's precision is much better IMO for higher tension uses than low tension ones.  Hence, it does a better job on snares and smaller toms than it does bigger ones.  But again, remember its purpose and limitations: it gets you quickly to a near-tuned state, from which you can now spend your time tuning.  I use it in concert with a DrumDial.  In summary, I like this product and use it nearly every time I tune.  If used properly it saves time and pro ides convenience.	1
really cool looking rosin, works well and is just overall awesome, you cant break it either becuase its in wood	1
Favorite drumsticks.  Great for people who have sweaty hands and don't want their sticks to slip.	1
Thin material but it does what I need it to do. Protect while in transport. If you want better pay more $$$.	1
I am very pleased with this product and intend to do for further business with Gator Cases as a direct result of my experience. Too often I have had less than adequate experiences with other alleged professional case providers. Not so  the CASE in this CASE. In this Case you have made me happy and restored some confidence in credibility of service intent. Thank You!	1
When I bought my son a new Ibanez bass guitar (big upgrade from his Fender Squier), I wanted him to have a good case to protect the new instrument. The Gator case is an outstanding product, and the price is definitely right.  Very sturdy, yet surprisingly light. The case firmly yet softly surrounds the bass when the case is closed. No worries about harsh handling. The case will protect the bass. Two storage areas provide ample room for a tuner, cable, and other small items. Huge upgrade to the padded gig bag he was using.  The lock is really only for preventing people from removing the bass from the case and messing around with it. It would not stop a thief from getting in with a screwdriver, though a thief would likely take the case with the bass and deal with the lock later.  If you need a solid case that isn't heavy and doesn't break the bank, buy this case!	1
I got it a week before I expected it, it's exactly what I expected, I bought it to use in lieu of the stuff that came with my violin kit.	1
No complaints at all.  My cello playing is terrible, but it was that way before I got the rosin... :P  Now, my terrible playing at least has a steady resonant tone.  Do a little research into the type of rosin you should get.  For me, this is perfect because I live in the tropics.  If I were to live in Canada, I may want to switch to a darker rosin.	1
This rosin is so much better than the rosin that came packed with my new violin. It doesn't take so long to rosin a brand new bow.	1
I haven't played violin in a very long time, but since I am a guitarist and a huge Jimmy Page fan, I wanted to take up guitar bowing.  I am not experienced enough with rosin to say that this is exceptionally good, but what can I say?  It gets the job done.	1
Nice feel & look beautiful. Produces a unique sound and responds to tap height and force. Great for slow song or when you need to play quietly. Great stick for grip also, I have severe nerve damage in my hands and fingers... Remedy to the drop sticks issue. 5 stars.... .	1
It has a cool springy 60s reverb like tone I really like, I recommend this to anyone looking for that sound. This pedal eats batteries even when its off so I would recommend buying a power supply.	1
Considering the price of the dominant  / boutique pedal brands for a reverb pedal the DSR-1 is a bargain! It sounds great, gives you mild to wild and it's built like a tank! If size isn't an issue it's a no brainer for the price. The reverb tone in your head is definitely somewhere in this pedal!	1
Amazing!!! WOW this sounds great. Dripping wet surf sound if you want it or dial it back for a more subtle reverb sound. Really nice to have the tone control too. The "kick pad" really can give a nice punch, just like my old vintage 60's & 70's amps I had years ago, when you bumped them you would get that same spring shake sound, a nice little sonic BOOM.	1
Danelectro has done a fine job here with this "real spring" reverb pedal.  They have blended a small analog spring reverb with a digital delay to make it seem bigger.  For just over a hundred bucks, it does a pretty darn good job. Here is a crappy youtube video that I made so you can hear what it sounds like. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W071aC5k9g&feature=youtube_gdata	1
Pretty cool and has a real tank inside! Lots of mods available online.	1
fun toy, this is an actual spring reverb (as in there's a spring in there, not a digital simulation) the kick panel is just a piece of sponge stuck on the case so you won't ding up the pedal if you want to start the spring oscillating manually. I love the sound. I'm currently using it with a Novation Bass Station II and it sounds great.	1
This key has made getting a consistent sound when tuning my heads so much easier. It works as it's supposed to, and works pretty well. You will still need to do some fine tuning with a standard drum key, but this will do a lot of the work for you. It doesn't come with any kind of literature, but is easy enough to figure out on your own. Some tuning tips or something would have been nice, but it's a solid product that has really simplified what was once a frustrating process for me	1
I got this for my banjo and the bolts are long and odd shaped. It's hard to get this on there, it seems it is too shallow, but when I get it on it seems to work.	1
I bought this product even though there were several mixed reviews about it. I am glad I did. I am a beginner and have only tuned my kit by ear once before. I used this key for the first time 2 days ago as I bought a second bass and floor tom to add to my kit. I had to assemble my new drums when they arrived and tune them. There are many instructional videos on youtube on how to use this key but, in my opinion, not very good and not much help to me. The instructions that came with this torque key was not very clear either. To use this properly, you should turn the dial counter-clockwise all the way to zero until it stops (this was not mentioned in the product instructions or any of the instructional videos I've seen). Then, you can set the tension you want and start tuning your drums in the star pattern as usual. Once the tension is reached, the key will click and you can move on to the other lugs. Of course, you should only turn each lug 1/4 at a time and not turn it all at once until you hear the click. For me, I still fine tune my drums by listening after all the lugs have reached the same tension. I should mention that the dial on the key can go around twice. This means that if you want to set your tension at, say 12, you would turn the dial clockwise passed zero and set it to 2. At least, this is how I used this key and it seems to work for me as my drums sound pretty good. I think of this key as just a tool to help you tune your drums quicker with not much guess work, especially, if you're not good at tuning by ear. It was well worth what I paid for.	1
A friend and I have run across a luthier who makes some cool stuff as well as repairing/restoring older guitars. My friend had a Tele custom made for him and needed a case so I ordered this one and it hits the spot. The neck is cradled in there nice and the guitar doesn't move at all. My buddy likes the case so I am happy.  Nothing gets 5 stars - there are no generals present.	1
I like Gator products, this is no exception, at first my Strat wouldn't fit, but I had strap locks on it, I took the strap off and it fir perfectly. nice and cushy inside, smells awesome inside (I'm a wierdo I know, but I love that smell). The only thing that kept it at 4 stars is that it doesn't have "feet" on the narrow bottom end, so you could stand it up. Otherwise it feels good and sturdy, the lid closes nice and the three latches feel secure, probably nor an ATA case, but then I'd never check my baby so I'm not worried about that. Long story short, It's worth it.	1
Fit an SX Les Paul Jr. Clone well.  Very sturdy, great product for the price.  It's not like buying a Gibson LP case, but it does a great job for half the price.	1
My daughter just got a violin and loves.  Who knew you need resin?  The violin was useless until she researched herself and found this product.  Back to working order.  Great.	1
The first one I got took a serious pounding from UPS during shipment. I was surprised to see th extent of the damage on the outside and no damage internally that looks like it would have affected a guitar, if one were inside. I sent that one back and ordered another and got it from FedEx with no issues.  I decided to go with this case for my new&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Ibanez-S8BK-Black-8-String-Electric-Guitar/dp/B00B77JKD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Ibanez S8BK Black 8-String Electric Guitar</a>, which doesn't come with a case, after reading another review here that stated how well it worked with another Ibanez eight string. I can confirm that this case does fit much larger extended-scale guitars very well. The WizardII-8 neck lays very nice and snugly into the groove and the guitar doesn't knock about inside as I carry it. It's also much less flexible than other hardshell ABS cases I've had in the past for my Fenders so when you lift the case lid it moves altogether instead of twisting and sagging. It seems to be well worth the price for long-scale instruments.	1
This a great mid-range case. Hard shell and soft interior. My telecaster fits in well with minimal wiggle room. The latches are adequate. All around good case. Only slightly below a 175$ case.	1
I bought this case for my brand new Fender Telecaster because the price lured me away from a hard shell Fender case. I haven't taken it on any long journeys, but for lugging it around town and in the car, it gets the job done. Here are a few things I like/ dislike about the case I received:  Pros- -The case will fit your guitar very snugly. My Telecaster fits firmly in place, the headstock brushes up against the top of the case and the body brushes up against the bottom. There is also little wiggle room horizontally if you plan on standing the case up. The plush is surprisingly soft for the price.  -It's stackable. If you own multiple guitars and are tight on space, the groove on the bottom of the case fits inside the one on the top.  -There is plenty of space inside the case. I've got a strap, a set of spare strings, a cable, earplugs, picks, a tuner, etc. all comfortably fit in the two compartments. There's also room by the headstock if you need extra space.  -It's tough enough to get you most places. I wouldn't necessarily recommend stowing it on a plane or in a cargo bay, but under your watch, and with care, this case offers protection as well as any other one does on the road.  Cons- -Craftsmanship is a bit of an issue with the case, or at least the one I received. The outside of the case feels a bit cheaply made. Whenever I close it, I have to pull (with some force) on the lid to make sure it aligns properly with the bottom. Otherwise it jams up when it latches. Not a huge complaint, as it's pretty easy to live with, but it's worthy of knocking a star off.  -Not as much body contour and neck support as you would get with a brand name case. My Fender hard shell case, for example, is softer plush and carved exactly to fit my Fender P Bass. Since this case is half the cost of brand name cases, however, and doesn't advertise to fit any guitar specifically, it doesn't have to.  -Doesn't fit all electric guitars. If you have a guitar with a very wide body, for example, my friend's Gretsch hollow body is too wide for this case. Be careful and measure your guitar or try one out before you spend the money.  In all, this is a cheap case that is very good value for money. It's a little short, and fits most electric guitars snugly. Although there are some minor issues with quality, I know that my Telecaster is well protected by this case and I trust it enough to carry around and haul in the car.	1
Love this!	1
Been playing for a long time.  I bought the light and dark variety to try out.  I love the light rosin.  Goes in easily and has a pleasing tone without too much dust.  High quality rosin made by a string expert (Kaplan's recipe).  As good as rosin costing 2-3X.  Do yourself a favor and pick up a cake of it and try.	1
I am an intermediate cello player still looking for what works best for me. I took the advice of the 5 star reviews especially, "take the chance and spend a few extra bucks" and "works well with carbon fiber bows". Maybe it's psychosomatic but I really feel and hear quite a difference between this and the less expensive rosin.  I've tried the light, amber and even gold flake and like the dark the best out of all.	1
Junky, budget-line low grade with a nice logo. i decided to return within 10 seconds of looking this over. Both the latches and hinges are the lowest grade, thinnest, wobbly junk metal you could imagine....feels like they'll snap right off with your fingers. this case is shockingly inferior. SHAME ON GATOR believe me i was just as disappointed to unpack a piece of garbage from a name like GATOR as you would be. but gotta say they have a reputation to uphold and deserve NO slack for selling CRAP....dont buy it unless you plan on using it for storage in your closet. in the real world this won't last 6 months without falling apart. made in China, naturally.	-1
I was looking to get a hard shell case to protect my guitar better than the gig bag it came with. It fits my Kramer great!! And the price was very competitive.	1
I bought this case for my Spector Legend and I am happy with the build quality and the latches. I bought this with amazon prime and skipped the shipping after I saw this case new in a local store for around $90.00. I own the similar priced SKB case already and the Gator is very similar in build quality.  I found that the case also fits my Schecter 5 string and even my Squier 70's jazz bass, (barely) so it will serve me well. I keep each of my basses in a case regularly and I may buy another Gator for the Squier since I dislike gig bags in general. The inside of the case is not as plush as other cases, but for the price, this case seems to be top notch and should last a long time. I have a friend who has had one for more than 5 years and although it's pretty beat up, it is still holding up.  Comparing this case to the universal skb case, they both seem to be very similar and the latches both seem to be very strong. The inner linings are both plush but no overdone. For the price, this case beats the wood cases, as many of them seem to crack and come apart after awhile, (ie. Road Runner, which I saw cracked with wood showing in the store.) The case seems to be strong and the plastic exterior flexes a bit most likely to cushion any impact. all in all, this is a good buy.	1
I got my daughter a cheap fiddle here and the rosin SUCKED big time so we got this to use instead. Works well once you learn the trick of scuffing it up the first time you use it. I know everybody knows this already, but I've never played with a bow before, most all my instruments use pics or at least fingers.	1
I got myself a Cecilio violin to get me going, it came with rosin but unlike this one it is  circular and a bit tough to work at. For the price, seriously, why not?	1
No more guessing if the lugs are evenly tightened! This is a great idea, well executed. There is a round dial you turn to adjust the tension. It took me a while to realize that the numerals 0 through 9 are not permanently set. I originally thought there were only 10 tension settings, when in fact you can rotate the dial fully numerous times to loosen or tighten until you find the level you want. Once set, you turn until the black part snaps out of place. Then you snap it back and continue all around. Only wish they had one, or an attachment, that worked for hand tightened bass drum lugs.	1
I purchased this rosin for my daughter, she has only been playing the violin for 8 months. The first rosin she used came with the violin. Compared to the first rosin, my daughter really likes this one. It isn't as sticky, and easier to clean off the Violin.	1
Once I realised that you needed to scratch the Rosin to get it started it worked great.  Very easy to use and gets the bow going quickly.	1
I purchased this for a friend who has just taken up playing the violin, she prefers it over the rosin that came with her student violin because of the wood that forms a grip around the rosin.	1
I live in Phoenix and started playing violin in November (it's March now). I ordered the Kennedy carbon fiber bow and it sounded great out of the box, but I noticed that the tone was changing over time. I discovered that while my original bow worked well with light rosin, the Kennedy worked best with dark rosin. Changing to their recommended rosin improved the tone immediately. I also found that this rosin worked great for the Fiddlerman carbon fiber bow.  I don't know if it will make a difference when it heats up here, but for now, this is my rosin of choice for these two bows.	1
I think this very good and the best of the "light" rosins I've tried. Seems to last well and it isn't very dusty.	1
I found this rosin through a recommendation from Fiddlerman (excellent site, BTW).  I prefer dark rosin to light, especially for synthetic core or gut strings.  This is good rosin, particularly for general use, and it's become my default rosin.  It applies easy and I didn't get a ton of dust after a playing session.  It's softer and stickier than the light rosin I was using, and I think that really helped me with a different, more complex tone.  Or it could be my imagination.  Either way, I really like this rosin a lot.	1
My Schecter Blackjack SLS C-1 just fits cushion to cushion. Happy with it for the price. I would buy another one.	1
Arrived in great condition, not cracked or anything. You get exactly what you expect: dark rosin. Works well on my viola and violin.	1
Great Quality!	1
This is my favorite rosin. I bought the light rosin and it has become the only one I use now. It's a good deal of rosin for $7+; it will be a long time until you need to buy more.	1
I have been playing the violin for about 15 years when I first tried D'Addario's Kaplan Artcraft Rosin in Light.  My old rosin was getting old and not as grippy as it once had been and had always created a disgusting layer of thick white dust after playing so I decided to give another rosin a shot.  After doing some research and deciding I didn't need $30 rosin manufactured in small batches or rosin with gold flecks ect...  I just wanted a good quality rosin.  After reading reviews (on and off of Amazon) and speaking to other violinists I decided to try D'Addario's Kaplan Artcraft Rosin.  I didn't really think about whether or get light or dark--I've always used light although I did try dark once and I just didn't like how much softer it is.  When I tried the rosin I was impressed with how grippy it is and how well it worked for me (I am currently using D'Addario's Pro Arte medium gauge stings).  I was pleasantly surprised how little dust was created.  Now lack of dust isn't a reason to stop wiping off your violin--but it a wonderful benefit of this rosin.  I would highly recommend trying this rosin.  Even if you don't like it--it isn't expensive to try if you are looking for a different rosin.  For beginners--it's way better than the rosin your inexpensive instrument or rental instrument came with.  If you are buying this for a younger child I would recommend you look for this same rosin but in the little black box.  Using rosin that is attached to a cloth (like this one is) can be difficult for younger children.  This rosin in the black box with be easier for them.  Don't forget to lightly rough up the surface of the rosin with a fine grit sandpaper (so much better than using your keys which can crack the rosin) to ensure it with stick on your bow hair.	1
I've always had the wood hard cases for my guitars, so I decided to try the moulded type thinking that it will stay nicer longer than the wood ones which seem to crack or have the tolex peel off.  The information on the internet about this case is pretty spartan... I had a hard time finding any real useful info, so here's my report:  -The case has 4 latches, not 3 like in the image shown. One of the latches is locking. There is a name tag plate near the handle. -The foam is very stiff on the inside; think styrofoam rather than sofa cushion. There is a softer padded area which contacts the bridge/string area. Everything is covered in a fairly thin feeling plush fuzzy material. -There are two 14" long storage compartments, one on either side of the neck. There are no lids for the compartments except for when you close the case. -The open rectangular body cavity is 13-5/8" wide by 20.5" long on the bass side and 21" long on the treble side (there is a step at the lower bout area). -The headstock area is full width and 10.5" long. It goes deeper than the main body area to allow for angled back headstocks. -The maximum length inside is 47.5"  Overall the quality seems pretty nice, at least as nice as any wooden case I have, and should protect as well or better.  It doesn't seem any heavier either.	1
This is the best case ever for the money!  I have purchased four other cases and none are as well constructed as the Gator Deluxe.  I like this case so much, I plan to purchase two more this week.	1
I recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars. One was in the SKB Fender case ($99.95 on Amazon), the other in this Gator case purchased locally.  I was told it was just as good as the Fender case. Both ended up in checked luggage.  After 1 flight from Florida to LAX and back (non-stop, minimal handling) the glue on the top section gave up.  The padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case.  Neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape, but after having the padding fall out, I just ordered another SKB Fender case.  The Gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips.  The SKB Fenders will be my airline cases from now on.	-1
I ordered this for my Jackson DKMG. This is my 1st Gator case, and I'm very pleased with it. It is similar to SKB and fits my guitar very nicely. Being lightweight is a big plus as well, and also the secure feeling of having a HSC. I will definitely buy this again for other guitars and highly recommend it. Just remember that this model is for standard type axes; Strats, Teles and such.	1
Overall this is a good head and a good price. I have used it on 2 drum sets so far and overall I am pleased with the sound! So much so that I just bought heads for a 3rd drum set.	1
I purchased this to house a Partscaster style guitar that deserved a proper case.  This is a bit thicker than your standard Strat rectangular case by an 1-1.5 inches and probably a bit better built.  It fits the standard Stratocaster body well, but does not allow the vibrato arm to remain on the guitar.  There is quite a bit of storage space on either side of the neck compartment, but I generally don't trust case compartments to carry anything but a cloth (nothing worse than something hard, heavy, pointy banging around in the case next to your guitar.)  The case compartments are open.  All in all a very worthy generic case.	1
I purchased this case for Jackson dk2m orange splash bengal electric guitar. I was worried that it wouldn't fit because no one in the reviews used this case for a Jackson guitar. I recieved the case today and my guitar fits perfectly and even has a half inch of room from the tip of the headstock to the end of the case.  The case looks to be well made and solid at first glance and it looks like the two compartments can hold whammy bars, tuners, extra strings, picks, straps and small stomboxes without problems. The interior is nice and plush for your treasured guitar, so you don't have to worry about scratches and scuffs.  It seems robust enough to handle a beating, it survived getting delivered by UPS so that says a lot. It's also pretty light when it's empty, the whole case is very small and compact, which I like.  I hopes this review helps guitarist looking for a home for their guitar.  Peace out...	1
Great! Doesn't dust so much like other resins do.	1
still use it till this day	1
Love em!	1
Perfect.	1
It's a patch you put on the bass drum head. Not a lot more to say. Selected this model because I have Evans heads.	1
It's designed to protect and extend the life of your bass (kick) drum heads, and they work, with out any effect on the sound.	1
I play drums since 17 years ago, In all this time I used Evans Drumhead and Evans accesories... Here in Venezuela its expensive too, for this reason I buyed by amazon Awesome Products	1
This lengthens the life of your bass batter head infinitely.  I have been using a black nylon one for a while but it wore my beater felt a little bit, so I switched to this.  Currently running on a 22" coated eq4 playing rock and jazz sounds great!	1
I am not a loud player since I do mostly jazz and acoustic sets, but my primary drum kits (a Tama Stagestar and Groove Percussion Travel Kit) come with smaller bass drums that require me to use tom tom heads.  The Stagestar's 18" head does not present the main problem, but the Groove Percussion kit with its 16" bass drum requires that I use tom tom heads.  To protect the heads on both kits and prolong their life I use these EQ patches (the single for the Groove Percussion kit, and double for the Tama).  One of the best things about this patch is it does not change the sound or tone at all.  After going through fits getting the Groove Percussion kit's bass drum tuned I appreciate the fact that sound dynamics remain the same before and after the patch is applied.  More importantly, I have confidence that my bass drum heads will not need replacing due to wear for quite some time because these patches absorb all of the wear and tear.	1
I bought this to bring my fender strat with me on airplane trips.  I check the guitar in baggage with this case and it seems to protect it just fine.  the it is very good for a Stratocaster and there is a little extra room inside for tuner, picks, tuning forks, capo, etc.  and..........the price was very good.  best I could find for this time of hard case.  The only thing that is sort of weird is that most employees at the airport are constantly asking me if I have a gun in case.  If you need basic protection of your guitar, this will do very well.  I do not know if it will fit other guitars.  I have heard that some are too long for it.  but.......for the Fender stat, it works just great.	1
This is the second one of these I've bought.  I have no complaints whatsoever.  I have one holding a Strat and another one holding a ESP custom.  Nice and snug.  I haven't been able to find one for a Schecter bass though.	1
Chose these because they have the highest angle possible of all the iso foams I researched.  These angle up to 8 degrees (foam is 2.75" tall on the highest side).  These work.  Definitely cut the unwanted extra bass I was getting from just having my speakers sit on my desk (and the angle points them right at my ears, without having to augment my desk).  Not saying you can't get the same performance from any other foam, but good luck trying to make homemade ones look worth a damn.  Only negative for me is the seams between the pieces are difficult to get perfectly aligned so all of them together look like one piece (I'm OCD when it comes to that stuff).  If you can find another brand that's one piece and fit your speakers, go for that...but I doubt they'll have a these angles.	1
Great transaction. Item as described	1
Does the job. I haven't played regularly in a couple years and the higher quality hill and Stradivarius rosin I had was getting really old so I can't compare it to those. I bought this because I put D'addario Red Labels on my violin.	1
best rosin i have ever used  easy to use...	1
These will help keep your monitors from shaking your desk and prevent the bass from distorting your audio. They last too. Bought these years ago.	1
Thx	1

It is holding up very well and it last long on my bow. I use my bow on my guitar and this stuff really makes it work!!! Quality product right here!!!! Its very hard and it seemd like it will last a very loong time, depending on how long it will last on the bow it self. Im very happy with this product. it seems smaller than advertised but i guess people should look and the specifications and not jus go off the pic... Very nice!!!!	1
Great product. I wanted to reduce resonance from my speakers to my turntable as they all share a bench. Notice an improvement right away have since added their isolation platform and my rig sounds pretty nice. Highly recommended	1
Vandoren reeds are second to none in my opinion. These arrived looking fresh and just like Id bought them from the music store.	1
Gets the job done. Looks and feels nice. Works like a charm absorbing unneeded vibrations.	1
good quality and fast ship A+	1
I highly recommend these.	1
good	1
I paid close to $40 for this product. It does what it says it does yes, but other foam of this quality can be purchased for $10. I regret reading the comments on this item because that is what lead me to purchase this overpriced foam.  I did a field test with typical packaging foam that came with my KRK Rokit 5 speakers and the performance between this foam and 2$ packaging foam are almost indifferent. You could put your speakers underneath some books for similar performance and obviously 1/4th the price. This item doesn't add any real value to customers.  I'm not sure how so many people convinced themselves that this foam is worth more than $25.. They are squelching negative comments about there product so be-careful about this product and others from Auralex.	1
This is something that costs less than $40 that will noticeably and instantly improve any system that isn't already using some form of speaker isolation. These are fantastic for a cramped studio space like mine. I use Yamaha HS50 5 inch 2 way speakers and an HS8S  8 in. sub, a nice little setup that doesn't break the bank and, more importantly than "sounding great," which I feel they do, I know what they sound like. There isn't even a comparison to having the speakers sitting on the table vs. on these isolators.  Even if you don't get these,  it's criminal not to use some kind of isolation if you're forced to use a table top like I am. This is the least expensive of many good options- and some people who already use expensive speaker stands STILL use these, I've been to many a "legit" studio that uses them. These also allow you to angle the speakers toward your ears, another huge benefit. And here's the coolest thing for me at least- since my monitors are so small, I only need one set of pads under each, leaving the 2 other sets to go under my sub! It isn't ideal, as the feet of the sub squash the padding more than the flat bottom of a speaker, but it does make for a lot less floor vibration= the sound image is more "in front of you" than without. I may get a sheet of acoustic paneling, and maybe carpet that, to put on top of the foam to help the pads last longer by distributing the weight of the sub.  So if you have a compact setup, you can float your whole system for $35.	1
If your looking at these you know what they are. Great price.	1
Humor aside; what can I say? They are just foam, but boy do they work well! Sure, you can go out and cut your own, but these offer so many advantages due to their smart design and your ability to adjust angles, etc.  My bass response used to drone quite a bit due to my working space and surfaces picking up the resonating low frequencies (the speakers were desk mounted). However, since installing these (and yes: THE "1 PAIR" BOX COMES WITH TWO SETS OT TWO PADS!) the bass response really kicks, and no longer tails off like a fat man trying to roll himself back onto his feet.  My girlfriend was also happy to hear that when I mix now, the lower frequencies no longer travel through the walls rattle the bathtub water making her think the T-Rex from Jurassic Park was coming.  I expect with these pads that any moment Hans Zimmer is going to call me asking why my mixes sound so good. Well, the secret's out Hans! If you ain't using these pads you might as well hang up the baton, not that anybody uses those things anymore!	1
These are a little pricy, but if you're dealing with low end wobble or muddiness, they'll clear it right up. I use these to position my monitors and tighten up the bass response, and there's definitely a noticeable difference.	1
goood	1
Great!	1
Great product, no problems.	1
I give this CHROME Stop Tailpiece 5 starz after it fit perfectlly without and tools or any trouble.  Thats right, no tools! No drilling, not routing, no painting,slips right in! And a great price, compared to the rest of the interweb stores as of April, 2013. Brilliant, thick mirror chrome plating, perfect threads on both the male and female. I am the lucky owner of a 2006 Alpine White Gibson Les Paul Studio with the now valuable "DISONTINUED FOREVER" ebony fretboard (because of the Obummer adminstration) slim profile neck. These Les Pauls came from the factory with GOLD plated  hardware that rubs off after awhile. I am replacing ALL the gold with CHROME, and this Amazon item Gibson Gear CHROME TAILPIECE is the perfect factory replacement and looks fantastic! It fits all Gibson STOPBAR models, including the SG. Remember, if it's a real Gibson, only buy Gibson parts, and only from... --> AMAZON! Kirkwood~	1
These MoPads are pretty amazing. I recently just purchased the Atlantic 33935701 Gaming Desk so I had a feeling that I would need these pads. These pads are a must for an amateur recording studio setup with little or no acoustic treatment. Sitting your monitors or speakers on these pads will produce an even better quality sound experience and they also will get rid of unwanted bass vibrations from your desk. I love that you can use the extra pads to angle them any way you want for your set up. These pads make my bookshelf speakers sound AMAZING. It's like I'm using actual studio monitors. At $40, you can't go wrong with these pads for you studio. It is a MUST to have these.	1
Don't get me wrong Auralex is a great company with great products, but damn the prices were to high lol, Don't know if the materials cost a lot to make "which i doubt " i know the music industry is a multi Billion dollar industry now , both quality equipment an accessories cost a lot but DAMN some people can't afford to pay that price lol. Anyway, great product keep up the good work.	1
Aside from the inteded use, I have also enjoyed the extra foam for other stuff...  To be honest I don't have a professional studio so I probably didn't need to buy these, but I enjoy that they angle the speakers toward me.	1
I bought these #2 clarinet reeds for a gift.	1
I just got this pedal after a long wait. I was drawn to this wah because of the auto switching feature. I have always hated the noise caused by engaging the wah. I do love that about the Bad Horsie, but was also pleasantly surprised by the contour wah feature. The difference in price between the Bad Horsie 1, and 2 is only $4 on Amazon, so I figured what the heck. It turns out I like the contour even better than the regular effect. I feel like I can dial in a cleaner sounding wah using the contour. It gives you control over the wah that most wah pedals lack. I wish more wah pedals considered it a standard option. I love the tone preservation this wah give me as well, it does not seem to change my tone much when it is engaged. I love it!	1
A little pricey for a piece of foam, but hey, that's auralex! They come with adjustable pieces so you can alter the angle, and they do indeed isolate the monitors.	1
I really really love wah pedals. I have a Dime wah, wylde wah, kirk hammett wah and a snarling dogs wah. I love the Dunlop wah sound a ton and was kind of expecting this one to sound digital or underpowered. I was very wrong. this and my wylde wah are now my 2 favorites. This one is going to be my go to wah since its adjustable and doesn't have an on switch which can be a nightmare live. nothing worse than your guitar cord getting stuck in the pedal and not being able to switch it off. Quality wah sound and built like a tank!!	1
its not for me, I'm staying with VOX	-1
This is a great Wah Pedal! I have owned different wah pedals and this is by far my favorite one. I like all the setting and how you don't have to stomp on it to turn the wah on. You can also adjust how much wah sound you get from the pedal by the nobs on the side. This product is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone, new guitarist or old.	1
This wah is a really good wah pedal. I love the ease of use compared to pretty much any other wah pedal I've tried. The guitar's tone doesn't get diminished. Other wahs ,one has to really force the pedal to kick on and off. This wah pedal one doesn't need to do that. Just step on it, and it turns on. Just great. The contour and sweep is easily adjusted	1
Awesome!!!! The fact that the wah turns off when you remove you foot is worth the price. Now add the fact that it's true bypass, optical instead of taper pot, and super controllable. This is my favorite wah of all time.	1
Forget about cry babies, this has superior sound and quality of construction - big and heavy - built to be a family heirloom	1
It keeps my desk from vibrating, and they look nice.  Also, an audio engineer at my office thinks isolation pads are a good idea.	1
They do what they say they'll do!!!  Looking forward to buy more from this maker for the rest of my studio!	1
Many people who are considering the Morley BH-2 may also be looking at the Dunlop 535Q. Since I have both pedals, I thought it would be helpful to share my experiences with each.  Design: Being a Crybaby, The 535Q has that ubiquitous classic wah pedal look and feel to it. It is more compact and pedal board friendly than the BH-2, which is considerably wider. If you are used to the feel of the treadle on a Crybaby style wah, the Morleys spring operated treadle, with its steeper angle and longer throw, may take some getting used to. However, once you adjust to it, you may find the 535Qs treadle action to be fairly limited, clunky and awkward. Personally, I prefer the smoother feel and longer throw of the Morley. The 535Qs gain, center frequency and Q controls are side-mounted while the BH-2s knobs are on top. I find the Morleys controls easier to access than the Dunlops controls. The BH-2, of course, has no on/off switch or sweep pot. Battery access is easy with both pedals. The Dunlops battery door is a better design, however, since it is hinged and holds the battery firmly in place. The Morleys battery cover is not attached to the bottom plate and is very easy to lose. The Morley features red status LEDs for when the wah is in use as well as when the Contour mode is engaged.  No LEDs on the Dunlop. Either pedal can be powered by a standard Boss style 9V PSU.  Build Quality/Durability: Both pedals are built to stand up to the abuse of regular gigs and touring. The BH-2s switchless operation and lack of a sweep pot are obvious advantages when it comes to reliability since Morley have removed from the equation the two parts most likely to wear out or fail on a wah pedal. Because the controls are side-mounted on the 535Q, they me be more vulnerable to damage than the top-mounted controls on the BH-2.  Features: Both are very versatile wah pedals. The 535Q controls give you a bit more authority over the Q range and frequency response compared to the single Contour knob on the BH-2. However, the BH-2 allows you to easily switch back and forth between the standard Vai Bad Horsie mode and the Contour mode. I like having the regular BH wah tone and then switching to the Contour mode for a different tone. Its like having instant access to two different wah pedals. If you like using your wah as a tone control and leave it parked in a certain spot (ala Zappa, Mick Ronson, Jerry Cantrell, etc.) then you are out of luck when it comes to the Morley because the treadle automatically returns to the heel down position and the effect is bypassed once you lift your foot off the pedal. On the other hand, this design makes it easy to insert quick wah wah accents into your playing, such as during the last few notes of a solo. The latest 535Q pedals are true bypass and employ a red Fasel inductor. The BH-2 has a high quality buffered bypass and uses Morleys own inductor. I don't hear any tone suck with either pedal in my signal chain.  Tone: This is a subjective area since everyone has their own concept of what good tone is. Unsurprisingly, the 535Q excels at classic vintage Crybaby/Vox tones. With the Q control at or near the max setting, it is extremely easy to conjure up the throaty, expressive, vowel-like quack heard on classic Cream, Zappa and Hendrix (just to name a few) recordings. I think the Fasel inductor must play a significant role in this because I don't ever remember the Dunlop wahs from the 80s and 90s sounding nearly as smooth, rich and vintage sounding. In fact, I remember them to be downright brittle and nasty sounding! When it comes to pulling off really convincing vintage wah tones, the Morley misses the mark somewhat, in my opinion. It sounds a little bland and dull in comparison, especially with clean tones. In Contour mode, you can approximate more of a classic wah tone by turning the contour knob clockwise so that more of the upper mids and highs are emphasized. Just don't expect it to sound like a Clyde McCoy. The BH-2's more laid back, neutral sound actually is, I think, what makes it such a standout for higher gain tones since its "personality" is less likely to take over your distorted tones. Crybaby's can be too in-your-face and overbearing with distortion and fuzz. The BH-2 blends extremely well with dirt. On the other hand, by dialing back the Q knob and shifting the frequency center a click of two in the clockwise position, the 535Q is able to adapt nicely to high gain settings, too.  Conclusion: I really don't think one pedal is necessarily better than the other. Each wah is very well made (in the USA!), versatile and great sounding. If I was forced to only choose one, it would be a tough call, indeed. That said, I'd probably go with the Crybaby 535Q since I'm a total sucker for those funky, colorful classic wah tones that it seems to so effortlessly achieve with the right settings. On the other hand, the Morley Bad Horsie 2 really has its own thing going on in terms of looks, tone and operation. I actually like the feel of the BH-2 better, too. If you can swing it, GET BOTH!	1
I've loved the Bad Horsie for some time. I used to have the Bad Horsie original, but lost it in a move. This Bad Horsie 2 has the original wah, as well as the contour wah, so it's really 2 wahs in one. Great quality, as one would expect from Morley. I definitely recommend buying the 9V adapter for this as you'll just eat through 9V batteries if you try to go without it.	1
I did a big review on the Original Crybaby a while back after 20 years of use...long story short this became the final replacement after trying a lot of options. A lot of alternatives came at a higher price but I didn't think they were any better.  The only thing I had to do was adjust the factory delay time. Out of the box there's a one-second delay to activate the wah effect from when you put your foot on it - Steve Vai may like it but I wanted instant-on when I put my foot on it. The delay can be set to 3+ seconds but I don't know what sicko would want that. Anyway it's a quick & painless adjustment, remove bottom panel and turn a screw (need tiny flat head screwdriver).  No noise, no radio station interference, true bypass, basically just a pure wah effect. I love everything about it.	1
This is the best wah I've ever used. I've used a different Morley wah for about 20 years (WAH-SP) and it still works great. This one seems to be just as much of a beast, a pleasant surprise in a world where things seem to have steadily turned into under-engineered garbage that is designed to last 1 day longer than the warranty. Congrats to Morley for still making quality stuff.  One thing different from my WAH-SP is that this has a built in "delay" in the switching mechanism. I preferred 0 delay. This can be done, but requires removing the bottom plate. Not to scare you - it's just 4 screws and they tell you how to do it, but by default there is a delay in the switching mechanism that wasn't there in the WAH-SP that I found annoying. Guess Mr. Vai likes it that way, and I'll let that go, because I'm just glad Morley is still making this type of pedal.  The frequency curve is odd at first, if you are used to a CryBaby, and it has WAY more travel. If you like to ride the wah to put your guitar back/out front of the mix this thing is fantastic. Not so great for bow-chicka-wow-wow funk, where you rock the wah back and forth quickly, but great for tonal expression, if you get my drift.  Also, I love telling people I have a "Morley Steve Vai Bad Horsie 2 Contour Wah pedal" - what a mouthful. :)	1
Except for crappy rubber feet that fall off, built like a tank!  Sounds great, and is adjustable including the timing as well as the contour. Great for situations where you gotta do pedal tap dancing, doesn't start cracking like the regular wah pedal and lasts for a very long time. Only other thing I need to note is UNPLUG when not using it, otherwise your battery will die. Now when it dies, it will only affect the sound when it's engaged (nice safety "feature").	1
Great product	1
There are enough bases for a pair of stereo speakers in the box, with wedges for each.  I haven't tried it yet, but I suspect the wedges could be used independently for enough foam for 2 pair of speakers.  I'm glad I got this--works as advertised and isolates the speakers from the desk.	1
Personally I don't hear any difference in sound in any way at all .Looks to me that you could buy some foam without a company logo on it and get the same result for less money.	-1
For me, this wah was exactly what I was looking for.   I really loved this Digitech wah that I had about 20 years ago. The thing died after years of use / abuse, so I bought a Dunlop (Classic with the fasel inductor). Although the sound was acceptable (not great), it was only a matter of a few months before I started to have problems with the on/off switch and the potentiometer started to make some noise. Mind you, I am not a heavy user of the effect at this point, maybe used 50 times in three months.   Disappointed, I bought a Behringer HB-01 to try it out. At the price (about $30), I thought it was worthwhile to give it a try . Lo and behold, it is a good pedal with a nice range of sounds. May be made pf plastic, but I have had zero problems with it. I still use it and will keep it. Decent wah pedal. But, and when I listen to recordings done with that old Digitech wah and the Behringer, I don't have exactly the sound that I want. So, I kept on looking.   On to the Morley Power Wah / Volume pedal. Great pedal, great sound, built well, but not exactly the sound that I wanted. Still a keeper, but not perfect. Maybe I am too picky....   I decided to give this Bad Horsie 2 a shot. Now this is what I wanted all along! The standard "Bad Horsie" mode wah sound is excellent, but aggressive. When you use the contour mode, you can adjust the range and level of the wah effect over a wide range. For me, this was what did the trick. I have found several different contour settings that work really well for me and exceed the quality of sound that I perceived with the old Digitech.   My summary - PLUS column - Nice "bad horsie" mode wah sound Excellent range of adjustment in the contour wah mode Built well, except for the bottom / battery holder Switchless function is awesome and easy to get used to ZERO noise in switching on/off Nice mechanical feel, nice pedal spring tension Overall, an inspiring pedal  MINUS column - Battery holder does not engage in the bottom sheet metal base all that well without an effort.  Final score is that this is a great pedal and recommended for any guitarist looking for an adjustable pedal. Do not fear the switch less feature - it is nice and very easy to get used to.	1
wah wah.  wah wah wah wah! Wah?  Wah! Wah wah. Wah	1
Ive had mine for 4 years. Nice extreme wah sound, and the contour switch adds custom sound. 2 wahs in one. Nice feature. The auto off and auto on is nice, but it might drive some people crazy. If you don't like the auto off feature, get a Crybaby wah. There is a slight delay when you step off this wah, but its adjustable if you dislike it. Open the wah, and adjust the delay switch inside. the instruction book shows you how to do it. You can remove the step off delay through adjustment. Nice product.	1
This is a classy product that will outlast me! It is wonderful to find such a rarity - a properly engineered piece of equipment in an otherwise disposable plastic world. Worth every penny.	1
I'm a guitar player. I use two completely independent amplifier setups, one is for my over-the-top crunchy leads and the other is for rhythm sounds. I was hoping this pedal would give me a smooth transition between my two amp systems since it is advertised as having "pan" capability.  It does have a mode that lets it operate as a pan pedal, this is engaged by a clever switch, otherwise the pedal can act like a stereo volume pedal (which I did not need at all).  I don't need the clever switching arrangement at all, I need a GREAT pan pedal and I'm still looking for that.  This EB pedal does not work all that well for panning your signal. The taper of the pots used are such that there is a very rapid shift from one signal to the other when used in pan mode. This means that I can not get a gradual shift from one to the other, as soon as I begin to move the pedal a little from one amp to the other there is a HUGE change in volume. This makes it very touchy and pretty much useless for trying to add a little crunch to my rhythm sound.  I do use it for panning from one amp to the other when I switch amps for leads because it does this move without any clicks or pops. If move it fast you don't hear the ramp up in volume as it moves from one amp to the other.  I would not buy this again for my application. It's expensive. It is very heavy duty in the way it feels but I'm just not very satisfied by the way it works for my application. I've had other EB volume pedals and have not been delighted by them either, the string drive system seems to have a hard time staying adjusted right. I hope this one keeps working since it was not a cheap pedal.  I wish I could find a quality alternative pan pedal, the quest continues.	-1
It has nothing ot do with the sound of the distortion or the wah effect...Its the Optical sensor...Its OK for a beginner but as you develop your playing style you notice it has very LITTLE control over your volume. For example: There is a sooth lowering of the volume untill you at aroud 75 percent of the angle on the pedal (so at the range of movement youve used %75) the signal just cuts out...this has to do with the optical sensor...i was told it could be a bad sensor but after replacing it i had the same issue. The distortion is at best Decent for a guitar, but useless for a bass (i used it as a boost) the wah was nothing compared to any mainstream wah (Dunlop) or for that matter even an auto wah (Boss/DigiTech)...  In my opinion spend a little more and get a volume pedal, a wah and distortion...  Keep makin em Morley...Im sure someone will keep buyin em	-1
This pedal gives me what I'm looking for 100%! Sure the distortion isn't the crunchiest, balls-iest thing out there, but it's pretty sweet. It sounds like a classic 70s/80s overdrive. The volume pedal makes controlling levels a breeze, on the fly. No working your pinky around the volume knob on your guitar necessary. The wah comes on with one flick of a switch and gives me all the 'wokka-wokka' I need for my funky sets. This pedal is great and versatile. It's a stone-cold steal. I highly recommend.	1
Good Pedal, but extremely big and heavy. If you don`t have a lot of extra space on your pedal board or you don`t want carry too much weight, then buy the JR, the small one. This pedal is big big big.	-1
Fishman makes good products. The pickups are clear and good entry-level equipment. There are some counterfeits out there -- make sure item is sent with original packaging.	-1
Those of you that know about amplification probably already know that "single coil pickups are susceptible to 50-60Hz hum and should be kept away from fluorescent lights, dimmer packs, computer monitors and transformers." (Direct quote from the pickup packaging.) Unfortunately, I didn't know that, so when I installed my Fishman pickup on my Sigma Martin, plugged it in my Fishman amp, and heard a loud hum, I was surprised and disappointed. The hum makes this nearly worthless to me. It's probably a great product, but not when I can't use it in the way I'd hoped.  I guess the next step is to buy a "humbucker" pickup. In retrospect, it's obvious why they're named that.	-1
Who am I?  I'm a street musician. I used this pickup to amplify my steel string acoustic. I finger pick.  What's the deal with this pickup? What's to recommend?  A. It works at least for 6 months. It will amplify your guitar. B. It's easy to install and uninstall. C. You can send the cable directly to your amp without preamplification.  What else is the deal with this pickup? What's not so great?  A. Build quality is so-so. The pickup stopped working after about 6 months. The cork pads that clamp the edges of your soundhole also came unglued after about 6 months. Wear and tear may occur quickly with this pickup. B. Cable placement is awkward. C. Cable feels flimsy. D. Lots of hum. E. Seymour Duncan offers a slightly cheaper pickup of the same style. I have not used it as long or put it through the rigor of a season of busking yet. So far it sounds better than the Fishman. It's also easier to install, has less (but not no) hum, and the placement in the sound hole is less intrusive.  Should you purchase it? No.  Really? The Fishman pickup is cheaper than many other soundhole pickups, but you get what you pay for in this case. The sound is too hummy, the construction is bad enough to defeat the device. Go for Seymour Duncan instead. It's not a wonder-pick-up, but it is cheap, it has less hum than the Fishman, and build quality appears to be a little bit better.	-1
I'm sure these would be great strings for my little cello but I haven't been able to install them. The leader on the C & G string is wound so thick I can't even thread it through the pegs on my full size cello let alone the thinner holes on the smaller pegs on the small cello. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED, at this point. Waiting to hear from Amazon	-1
While this pickup works great for round soundholes, it only works when placed against the fretboard. My guitar has a unique heart shaped soundhole, which means I needed to place the pickup at the bottom towards the bridge (since its too small to fit the top of the heart).  Because the pickup only has angled cork - it only fits my soundhole by flipping it around. I didn't think this would be a problem, but it is.  Apparently the pickup is designed to have the low e only one way.  It doesnt sound right when flipped (you cant hear the low strings, and the high strings are way too loud). So I have to return it.  I knew about my unique guitar when buying, but couldn't find any info about whether this pickup could work regardless of which way it was placed in the guitar.  So other buyers who have similar issues need to look elsewhere.  But - I did try it on a normal guitar and it worked great. So if you have one of these, it's 4 star.	-1
This mic made me look bad several times while djing. Lots of noise and no on and off switch. Don't use this in aloud environment. The feedback is horrible.	-1
Not all That for it to be a Shure Brand!	-1
Very weak sound. One has to stay very close (almost touching the grilles) to get acceptable (not great) volume level. Returning it.	-1
Do not buy!  I bought these twice and had them replaced twice.  Never again.  The Evans Dot drum head is much better.	-1
Not a great mic, but if you need something realitively cheap, it'll do.  Limited dynamic range.  But, it works.  Wish I'd have gotten something a little nicer though.	-1
"Rollerwound" means these are more like flat wounds than round wounds in every regard. I made the mistake of trying these out on my Stratocaster just before a show. The tone of the wound, bass strings sounded dull ... like a set of regular round wounds after three gigs and they feel more like flat wounds than round wounds. Further, the tension is considerably higher than a normal round wound set of strings of the same gauge so, for those of you with floating tremolos, be prepared to tighten your claw and maybe be prepared to tighten your truss rod as well. These would  probably work well for jazz guitars but I'm more than a bit surprised at the use of word "Rockers" in the label. If you're looking for higher tension, warmth, and less string whistle, then these may be for you. If you're looking for that bright, new string "spank" go with standard round wounds.	-1
Rad sounding pedal but poor internal quality. It went bad after one year on my pedal board. It was protected with "pedal power" but just stopped working. I sent it off for repair and all they said was, "It cannot be repaired, we will return your pedal back to you next week."  I sincerely expected a $170 pedal to last longer than one year.	-1
Honestly I should have just stuck with moongel's. On the plus side they can be adjusted some what. I use them on the resonant heads.	-1
Not what I expected. Not very effective.	-1
OK.....but heavy.	-1
For seven bucks, I'd say you're better off getting a roll of masking tape with cash left over for a six pack to keep you on the level while tuning your drums.  The only advantage I see with these is the appearance - they certainly LOOK cooler than masking tape.  Or, if you like the 'adjustable' nature of this product, you can buy a dozen feet of sticky-sided velcro tape and make your own.  The bottom / flat ends of these doohickeys have a small - 3-4mm area of sticky stuff that doesn't adhere very long to the side of your drums, so most of mine are currently on the floor, under my kit.  Unlike the picture, they come in a "variety pack," and the smaller ones are so small that they barely reach my drum heads once the sticky end is adhered to the side of the drum.  I have a Gretsch 'Energy" kit - maybe your rings are shorter than mine, but overall I'd suggest another method.	-1
It just randomly pops off my bass, it's so slick that when you let go it the neck just goes straight down. I hate it.	-1
This strap is what you pay for. It is cheaply made and will not last the rigors of stage. Strap is not for pro use. Would not recommend for stage use unless you want a busted guitar neck.	-1
This amp sounds absolutely terrible with a bass. I've tried it with multiple different basses and multiple different cables and nothing seems to make a difference. I don't know why there are so many good reviews for this amp as the speaker and casing rattle so much you can barely hear the tone. Even at low volumes the farty buzz is overwhelming and extremely unpleasant.  The vinyl wrap is so cheaply applied that right out of the box it is starting to come off and touching the speaker. I thought maybe they shipped me a defective unit but the replacement I got is just as bad. If you're looking for something portable to play bass with, avoid this at all costs.	-1
received broken...sent back...didn't really want to..would loved to have heard it jam..but had a loose battery (sounded like it) and sparked everytime i plugged in...may eventually go with cheaper unit before i give up..good luck with yours..p.s.  AMAZON TOOK CARE OF RETURN IN A MATTER OF MINUTES..HATS OFF TO THEM..TKS AGAIN	-1
Very cheaply made, fimsy.	-1
Wrong color, I put them in the parts drawer.	-1
I tried this on a live gig from a buddy who raved about this pedal. Its has a great distortion and sustain, but its got a compressor circuit and you cant adjust it or turn it off, when I tried to pound a high note the attack and volume gets squashed/neutered. I know funk bassists and studio cats dig a good compressor but I absolutely cant stand one on my live rig(I expect and count on a GOOD soundman to add it in a live mix, great, as long as I cant hear it). Kinda pricey too, I ended giving this pedal back to my buddy, no thanks. I ended up buying the comparable MXR dist/D.I. that has a mid control and noise gate @ about a third less than what this pedal costs. IMHO a much better deal; more for less and no compress(ion).	-1
Says the numbers are white and embossed. They are not	-1
These are fine I suppose.  I liked the Page-like gold-foil topped ones better.  The gold on these appear too "golden" for the guitar tho.	-1
The paper is fine, but the spiral binding is of poor quality. The front and back cover of the book fell off in the first five minutes of use.	-1
The one I received was defective. Never got a decent signal out of it. I would literally have to scream into it with my lips almost pressed up to the cage. I'm giving it 2 stars because it's prolly a decent mic that I will never test. I switched it with a cheapo 'vintage style' mic I got off amazon into the same signal chain.. the signal came in much stronger although you can tell the low quality of the 'vintage' mic.  *and yes I know this mic requires phantom power. I had it running into an audient id14 interface.	-1
Been waiting a week to get this. Was excited when the UPS guy handed me my bubble wrap envelope. Was sickened when I  opened the package, however. Even if I could boil it clean it's unsightly! Major abrasions down the front, chips out of the paint, scratches, and what I'm guessing is oily fingerprints. I really don't know what it is...and just dirty. They couldn't even wipe it down! Who on earth thought this was acceptable to sell?! Not like they warned it was used, I would have never bought it. Rant over. It's going back. So disappointed.	-1
Washer was misprinted, shouldn't have made it past quality control Edit: Received a replacement with similar printing issues. Will not be buying this product in the future	-1
This polish left a horrible streaky residue on my Epiphone EJ200CE acoutsic.  Luckily I sprayed it (and it DOES spray in a very wide stream as mentioned in some reviews) onto the cloth (which luckily did NOT have the glue that I have seen mentioned in these reviews) and applied it in a very small test area on my guitar. I'm not sure if it is wax or what but I'm not using it again on that guitar. It did better on my Stratocaster however. The moral: make sure to test it first before using it on any guitar.	-1
my mom ask me to buy it	-1
The polishing cloth came glued to the bottle, and when I pulled them apart, the glue stayed with the cloth. This made one side of the cloth unusable, as it's covered with sticky goo that can't be removed. I sent email to Amazon complaining about it, but uncharacteristically, I got no response whatsoever. Having paid only about $6 for it, it's hardly worth returning, but I am a bit disappointed. Oh yeah, it polishes up my guitar real nice - with a different cloth.	-1
fell in less than 1 foot broke into 10 pieces	-1
these were a good deal and no harm to try, Thank you to the seller, but as for personal preference, I took a chance on these to try,The size and shape is good but they are a little to soft for me	-1
Would not recommend for all guitars. Hard to get on a lot of strap holders because the leather is so thick. Also, extremely squeaky on the surface of my guitar. I do not like mine.	-1
it works as a condenser... lot of barrel like noise inside... which means the model 3000 above  it, is quite a bit better...  but if you can find this mic for less than usd 80 it is quite ok for vocal, ( must TWEAK EQ a lot tho) and acoustic bass or guitar or cello, etc.. again, MUST tweak eq to reduce 100 to 1000 hz range, and increase the above 4k range...  in order to make it sound acceptable for semi decent recording... from the eq tweaks u now get the idea of how this thing sounds...  it is ok... just barely acceptable.. u want better, then get a GAP fc 4. not much tweaking ncessary but beware of QC probs...too so get from a really good dealer who can give u a new one if the fc4 u got, overloads or got too much noise eh.  thanks and hv fun.	-1
They need inserts of some kind to better handle the sheer weight of drum hardware.  Perfect size though.	-1
The strap slides all over the place. It's very pretty, but what good is it if it slides? How do you fix the sliding?	-1
I needed a new case in general for my guitar so I thought I would buy a nicer case like this one. Only when it was delivered that I realized that this case was far too small for any of my guitars. My Ibanez RG could not fit well and I have a Fender Strat that was too snug. It is a good quality case which is why I'm giving it 2 stars but I am returning it.	-1
Feels like a 5 dollar beginner strap.  Very cheap, stiff, scratchy plastic material backing.  The folds and creases do NOT go away and look ridiculous when hanging on your guitar.  Strap ends are however a very thick leather, and are absurdly hard to fit over a strap button.  At $20, this strap is a total ripoff.  I would not buy this strap for $5.  Luckily, Amazon is awesome and I was able to return it hassle free.	-1
Awful quality it's squeaks	-1
I mis-placed a 20 year old slide recently, and replaced it with the same model.  I note that both were brass, not chrome, despite what Amazon says.  It's not as heavy, the edges are not as well-finished, and I swear it's just a touch tighter on my finger ...	-1
The polish works well on unchecked finishes. It does nothing to restore checked finishes.	-1
Very small, can't even get my finger in this damn thing	-1
I have compared this Yamaha recorder to an Adler wooden soprano recorder.  There are many differences between the two instruments.  First of all the Adler recorder has a richer softer more mellow tone compared to the louder more piercing tone of this instrument.  The two instruments are also made in separate countries.  The Adler is made in Germany, whereas the Yamaha is made in China.  The two instruments are also encased differently.  The Adler comes in a blue and white Velcro case.  The Yamaha comes in a cheap plastic case with a hard to close snap.  Both of these instruments have Baroque fingering.  For the most part, they both play each note in tune, except for one. The F note on the Yamaha recorder is actually F sharp.  Not so on the Adler.  If you have a recorder student in your household who is learning to play the instrument for the first time, this recorder is fine for that.  As he or she grows up and advances in music, consider buying an Adler soprano recorder.  Recorder teachers should also be aware of the differences between these two instruments.	-1
junk	-1
My 14 year old son loves Mike Portnoy, but these were the 2nd pair of drum sticks within a month.  They don't last.  Yes, he loves drumming every day, but they should last longer than not quite a month.  We just bought 2 more pair from another company. I'm hoping these last longer.  I would not recommend these sticks.	-1
Was at Guitar Center, buying a Yamaha that was on sale.  Of course, since I was there in the acoustic room I had to try out all the competition.  Well, this wasn't really competition.  I know Epiphone makes some good guitars, but their cheap acoustics aren't them.  When they say it has a "select spruce top", what that means is that it's a laminate, like plywood, not solid wood. The top is the single most important part of the guitar.  How it vibrates gives the guitar its sound.  Laminates are very stiff, and will not resonate well.  And when they tell you the sound will "improve with age and playing"?  If it were solid spruce or ceder, that would be true, but a laminate will sound the same 20 years later.  Yamaha and Fender make inexpensive solid spruce guitars.  $200. or less.  Do yourself a favor. Get a solid spruce top. The  difference in sound is impressive.	-1
I returned these before I used them.  Wanted to use them with standard mic stands for a simple live mic setup for drums in small venues.  Microphones were much larger and heavier than expected.  Probably more suitable for using on a desk or table for a podcast, etc.	-1
It's not a bad mic.. good for starters.	-1
We would love to suggest using a hemp plastic is toxic and we have cut enough trees down on this planet!	-1
If you are looking for a recorder that can play in tune, do not consider buying this.  My kids have these for their elementary school music classes.  These cannot play notes with proper pitch.  We tried to tweak by adjusting the 3 pieces but cannot get any of them to play with proper tuning.  For example, D is registered between D and E flat.  Same problem with all other notes.  If you are serious about music, this probably is not for you.	-1
I owned one of these Zildjian bags for two years.  It is a good cheap price.  Unfortunately, after 2 years of bandmates taking it in and out of clubs, in and out of cars, it started to wear a hole in the bottom.  Needs heavier plastic reinforcement in the bottom.  I have had better luck with the $120 Paiste bag and the $100 Road Gear wheeled bag.	-1
This seemed so cool when I first got it..  This piece of crap lasted two gigs!  the bottom of the small cymbal compartment separated first.  Last night at my second gig with it?  The zipper tongue fell off!  wow.  Never had a product fail this fast in my life.  Really disappointed. All within 9 days. On a good note, the vendor, music 123 took it back and credited me in a timely manner. Very good store and recently made another from them through amazon.	-1
I'm surprised at the good reviews. This thing is a piece of plastic..that said   It's might last..might be strong enough.. I haven't had it long and I imagine many people have em so it could be ok in that department bit it is a piece of plastic.   Now the big problem is the sliders..it's hard to find the middle. The feel of the sliders are stiff and mushy. It's hard to get accuracy.   The  travel distance of the faders is small combine with the mushy feel. The distance between faders is really tight, there so close together its hard to move one at a time..  Sounds is warm though..	-1
It worked about 10 minutes and started cutting out. Sent it back.	-1
Introduces far too much hiss into the signal chain to be useful. The eq seems to function correctly but you won't get past the hiss unless you have a noisy rig to begin with. Noisy pedals make bad rigs worse and good rigs bad.	-1
shipped to me broken :P	-1
I was looking for an EQ for my guitar and read a lot on the subject prior to purchasing the Danelectro model. I made a bad choice. It was cheaply made and I didn't get the satisfying "click" from it when I tried to turn it on as I did from my other foot switches.  Then, after only two weeks of light usage, it just quit working.  During the same time period, I also tried out a Boss EQ stomp box which was highly superior to the Danelectro in both quality of sound and construction.  I would not recommend the Danelectro product.	-1
This is a basic EQ pedal, that is a bit noisy in my testing. Even when running on battery power, there is a bit of hiss that is just enough to be annoying in my rig and probably enought to be very annoying in some higher gain rigs.	-1
It's heavy (12+ lbs), it's ugly (just look at it) and the overdrive is useless. Nice "portable" design with two heavy UPS batteries in the back, plus the massive power supply. This amp just makes no sense to me.   I can't imagine what the five-star reviewers were thinking. I've owned probably a dozen different little practice amps and this is hands down the worst.	-1
Broke after two months, bad heating element.	-1
super small and the remote on has a manual feature	-1
Was expecting the straps to be positioned to allow strapping to floor tom, but with the bag opened the straps are sewn on the same end.  With the bag closed the straps are not accessable. Not sure why there are straps at all because for the life of me, I cant figure out how they can be attached to anything NOT in the bag.	-1
I bought this bag a few years ago and I just replaced it because it started to come apart at the seams. I stored a few pairs of sticks, drumkey, earplugs and some felt pads. It was not overloaded but it did not hold up well. It is too lightweight for travel. If you're a busy drummer, spend a few more bucks and get a heavier bag that will last. I just picked up an SBK deluxe bag for $25 at LI Drum Center. It is selling here for $50. The bag is heavy duty and roomy.	-1
We followed the instructions exactly. It put out less smoke than a candle. You couldn't even see the smoke. It was so pitiful. On the side, it says that you can only use that brand of fog fluid. Scam. DO NOT BUY!!!! A huge scam. Luckily, Amazon let me return...	-1
I bought one and returned it. I bought it for a school dance for my daughter. It sent it back and never got to use it. It smelt like it was on fire and melting plastic or something. Literally smoking. I did get another one, this one was the same exact thing. When it does turn on it works great, but only lasts for about 30 seconds before it turns off and then takes about a minute to reheat, then you can push the button manually to turn it back on. You have to sit next to it all while you want to use it as it doesn't turn on automatically. And it smells terrible. I never used it at the school as it would turn on the fire alarms. The kids were so disappointed. I never write bad reviews but this one was a terrible product in my opinion.	-1
Although well-built, this bag lacks a crucial feature: divided compartments so your sticks won't fall down inside the bag.	-1
Please keep in mind that these Chauvet 700 DJ fog machines have a hard wired "manual" control only controller. You cannot use a timer control on these. This was my fault for overlooking this in the product description. The reason for the low review is ... I bought 2 of these and seen that they do not heat evenly from unit to unit. Thermal protection does not allow them to operate until cooled down, thus I was not able to have fog on demand when desired. I will figure out a way around this but I just expected a more uniform product from Chauvet.	-1
This only works if you hold the remote that is wired to it and press the button. It will push smoke for a minute and than you have to wait for the light to come back on and press again. Only use I see for this is a DJ maybe.	-1
doesnt put out,like you need for a show,small stream	-1
ok	-1
not enough smoke	-1
Weak. Also has no remote control. Long wire is cumbersome.	-1
I don't like how noisy it is at all, it sounds as if a rocket ship is taking off. My roommates don't approve.	-1
I bought mine new in 2014. It hardly saw any use except for the initial audio tryout. Today August  10, 2017 it has failed. All patterns except for figure 8 are cutting out and there is excessive noise. I checked inside the mic and it has a sealed pot that can NOT be cleaned. These are similar to the pots in the Chinese made Marshall effects pedal that have been failing. I would stay clear of CAD products as I have also had Trions fail. One was defective brand new from the factory.	-1
Button does not work- the thing just goes all the time.	-1
Please take this review as an exception. I believe this is not representative of this product, which was returned to seller.  The mic I received had several problems 1) Loud 5 second burst of pink noise when +48v applied; 2) takes about 20 seconds for mic to come up to full sensitivity; 3) noise floor on the mic I received was approximately 17 dba (almost 25 times greater than spec); 4) low end response, without the roll-off filter switched in, was about 6 db lower than spec at 50 Hz; 5) Senstivity was also low @1khz; 5) mic was quite noisey during first the 10 minutes, but the noise floor and the intermittent sporadic low-level crackling sounds gradually decreased after 30 minutes of having power applied, but the intermittent low-level crackling noise never completely disappeared.  All tests were repeated on a different mic channel with the same results.  Studio is kept at a constant 25 degrees C, and 50% humidity.	-1
GOOD FOR PERHAPS 30 MIN AT 18,99 A BOTTLE OF JUICE PEOPLE GET FOOLED BY THESE ITEMS THEY ARE WAY UNDER VALUE FOR A SHOW	-1
These aren't to my liking.  They're a little too thick.  I'm one that just appreciates a regular plastic heavy pick.	-1
I got the tripod fast but,  the packaging was horrible! Some parts are broken and can't use the tripod. I think it would have worked fine but the packaging was crap. I still haven't gotten in touch with anyone about it. I want it replaced! Basically the part that's broken is where I can't extend it up to the 12 feet. So it won't go up cause the knob is broken off and I can't extend! Bummer!	-1
I chose these due to price.  They are marginal in their structural integrity.  They appear to do ok if you have pin spots or small PAR floods.	-1
outlets are not on the back but the top, and the rack plate (which does not conform to standard rack spacing; I had to drill another hole to use 2 screws) is attached at an odd angle to the rest of the case. This was clearly made for some very specific angled rack situation that I don't have / use. Oh, and 2 of the switches have to be taped in the off position, or they spring back up to the on position. I will be replacing this device very soon.	-1
I bought this tripod even after seeing reviews on other tripods where people warned of bad service in shipping. Silly me. It arrived with one thumbscrew broken, a punctured box, scratches through the powder coating, and dirt all over, like it had been sitting on the bottom shelf in the back of a dirty warehouse forever. From now on, I'll buy my tripods in person.	-1
I own a 14 of these clamps and the ones produced by "Leestar" are the real deal. If the clamp doesn't have the "Leestar" raised stamp with the nut symbol on the flat side where the T-fastener tightens your clamp will not tighten enough on your 1.5 truss. Your fixture will sag instantly. The new 1.5 clamps sold by Amazon no longer have this stamp and now they sag. I recently ordered four more and now have to return them as they are crap. Did American DJ go with a different manufacturer to cheap out? Not sure, but, these are worthless now and I'm not lining them with black duck tape to fix this issue. I'm going to call American DJ to see what's up with this.	-1
I played with these on my Strat for two days, then had to take them off. Sorry Fender. The lower E, A, and D wound strings were fine, but the higher E and B strings just had no life. And the G string was absolutely horrible. It had a dull, dead, thunky sound every time I hit a note anywhere up or down the fretboard. It was really noticeable and irritating so I had to replace them. Maybe I just got a bad set, but I've moved on now.	-1
These strings rust so easily in Hawaii's weather. Honestly I've never seen a set of strings rust over night until I strung my American Special Steaf... do not buy if you live in a humid area!!!!!	-1
A - 5th string broke when tuning.	-1
These are the weakest strings ever. I replaced the nut and bridge on my old Washburn and the high E string broke three times. I FINALLY had to substitute the fist E string with one of the second strings from another packet, which my calipers show to be the same diameter. If you are doing any luthier upgrades requiring loosening, bone filing, etc. for achieving perfect intonation then go right ahead and buy this three pack set. YOU WILL NEED ALL THREE FOR 1 GUITAR.  They broke while untightening them in order to make adjustments. Also, if you play your guitar for 5 minutes afterward you will have a bunch of nickel-phosphorouse gray stains on your fingers. Terrible quality. JUST PLAIN TERRIBLE.	-1
Make sure to measure out your guitar. These strings broke my pegs because they were too tight and still out of tune. Having a close friend take care of my guitar until new pegs come in.	-1
Sound seems stiff, not bad but stiff, it's not exactly what I was expecting it to be.  However it's better than 50% of other types better than preferring .	-1
The 1st string was six inches too short to be able to put on my Guitar....a factory error, apparently. Too bad, because the 5 strings I did put on have a very nice, easy to play feel to them. Good sound, as well. But my electric guitar requires all six strings, so this purchase was basically useless to me. Not sure I would give this product a second chance.	-1
I did not like these... stayed with D'Addarios (see other review)	-1
Fair (but only just) for the money. They sound great, BUT do not hold their tuning; even with Schaller tuners on a top of the line Strat. And if you don't mind them turning your fingers BLACK as coal after every playing session; these are the stings for you.  I've switched to Ernie Ball pink and they are excellent. Another plus is they're cheep. I've tired just about every sting there is to be offered over my past 42 years of playing like a mad man. Dean's or Ernie's are very good, but Fender needs great improvement over these "things not strings" before I'll ever buy them again. When it comes to electric guitars I am strictly a Fender man, but their stings suck. I see a lot of 5 star reviews...I don't get it. Now...on the othe side of the coin, I bought some for my Fender 6 which is a baritone guitar and those Fender string are perfect! Go figure...	-1
E (1) string broke before I could even get it half way tightened up to be in tune. No more Fender strings for me. I didn't buy these at Amazon, but at a local national guitar shop.	-1
I had high hopes for the these strings based on the reviews here. I have to say these are the worst sounding pure nickel strings I've ever put on my Mustang. My go to strings have been Dr. Pure Blues, and I've always used Ernie Ball (Pure Nickel and Slinky) and D'Addario strings on it.  First, these strings are really loud on for pure nickel strings. I was shocked, but I had to turn the volume down on my amp to compensate.  Second, these strings were not the usual warm sound I expect from nickel strings. They were very present and middy, and I mean VERY PRESENT AND MIDDY. These strings demanded to be heard above my effects etc.  I'm a fuzz guy, and it sounded awful with these strings. Really flat and splattery. The only pedal that improved with these strings was my wah. It loved the increased output and mids and sounded amazing.  I tried to shape the tone with my EQ and that helped some. I keep my EQ at the end of my pedal chain instead of in the effects loop, maybe that would work better.  I wanted to like the strings, but they aren't for me. I will say that they stayed in tune very well.	-1
I like fender but I do not like this guitar strings I think they're cheap and not well made it all it was like being a call in a clothes line I don't understand how such a great guitar company with market such poor strings I guess I'll have to put some better strings on my Stratocasters daddy	-1
Broke a G string after a couple days. Merely tuning it and it broke. Won't buy again.	-1
I was really hoping to like these, but I didn't.  The sound that I was hoping for didn't come around.  Another reviewer said twangy, and I'll go with that.  They also hurt my fingers.  I either practice or perform every day. so my calluses are good.  I pulled out my other guitar that still had the Martin Lifespan 92/8's on them and my fingers didn't hurt at all.  So I took these off and put the lifespans back on my primary guitar.  Finding the right strings is tough.  What sounds good to one person, doesn't to the next.  For the price, they were worth trying.  My primary guitar is a Martin DCPA4-r, and I like a deeper mellower sound.  You can really tell how different string sound with this Martin.  I've tried 4 different sets of strings on this Martin and is seems like the Lifespan 92/8's give me the sound I want	-1
I am a bit disappointed, especially for an American Made product. After installing these strings, they all sound "flat" like old strings do when they start going bad.  I guess it's back to Martin Strings for me, these are awful.	-1
I put these strings on Monday night. The third string, if it was in tune in the open position, was out of tune on the second fret! Second string was nearly as bad. After four days of fooling with it, I gave up and bought a set of regular Earthwood light gauge strings. On the plus side, the strings were very easy on my hands and sliding between chords was extra smooth. I wanted to love them, but alas, could not. I still love Earthwood strings, just not these.	-1
I bought these to use on a Martin for recording. I usually use Martin strings but thought I'd try these.  The first thing noticed was that whatever they are made out of is "much" harder than other strings. I could not even cut the larger strings with my usual wire cutters. After mounting, they play like Mediums rather than Medium-Lights - perhaps because they are a harder material- and the strings cannot be "bent" while playing.  Extremely stiff and hard. The tone is harsh and wanders.  It is not uncommon to hear an old string wander from the note going flat after plucked, but these did it immediately.  Hard to tune as well, particularly the G string - kept wanting to jump over the correct setting.  I have never had any of these issues with the Martin strings- I would not buy these again.	-1
the ball fell off the end stringing the instrument.	-1
Not a fan of these strings. I have tried and tried in the past to like Ernie Balls, but they have done nothing but disappoint. I'll just stick to the more expensive Elixirs.	-1
it was not in the package .. i receive someone else order ..phones were in it	-1
basic cheapo string works for the kids guitar since they never wash their hands before playing anyway.	-1
Admittedly, I bought these because of the low price, but paid for it in time spent re-stringing.  "Unpleasantly twangy..." and rusted the E and B strings in about a week.  I hadn't played on them more than 5 times for a couple hours at a time.  I keep my acoustic in a nice Taylor gig bag in a relatively dry, room-temp climate, so not sure how this happened so quickly.  Wound-up replacing them the next weekend.  I switched to Elixirs - my usual strings of choice.	-1
This pedal absolutely kills the tone of the instrument. If you don't have the threshold turned to max it won't kill the hum but if it's turned to max it kills the tone. I returned it and got the ehx hum debugger instead and it doesn't kill the tone. This pedal was a huge let down. I expect more from rocktron because most of their stuff is of quality build but it's like they quit halfway through with this pedal. I recommend the EHX or the ISP if you want to kill the hum.	-1
These are crap	-1
the .10 .13 and .17 all rusted, probably because they weren't stainless steal they were regular. hope this review helps.	-1
I don't like Ernie Ball strings. Period. Just my humble opinion.	-1
I did not like these strings that much. I found the tone to be thin and not very resonant. I won't buy these again.	-1
So here we go, the strings bend nicely I guess that's why they call them slinky but there is no bottom end to be had. I played with ligjter gauge strings by many companies including Addario and Martin and enjoy the sound, so I know it isn't an issue of string gauge.  I took these off my guitar after three days because there was no fun or enjoyment whatsoever listening to these Awful strings	-1
I love Ernie Ball's strings for electric, but their acoustic for 12 strings sound extremely dull. I installed them past week and now I am thinking to replaced them with Martin's.	-1
I usually like EB strings but these ones are rather poor in quality.  I am an amateur player  and can't afford expensive strings. I gave these a try and though the sound was fine the strings themselves felt poor in quality.  The G string windings started to come apart within a few days.  They are cheaply priced so I wasn't to about replacing them soon rather than later. In the mean time I will stick with EB Earthwoods for my acoustic needs.	-1
I tried the Elixir and after only a week I though they were not doing well so I tried these. The ratings on here are good. I even got two packages since the price was right. Well, I like the Elixir's better. These were one third the cost.  Learning about strings is expensive. These are the same as light - medium. I was running medium on the Elixir's but that was too much. The size on these are better but I like the sound of the Elixir's more. The feel of these strings are ok though.. I do not like the overall sound of the strings but on some songs they are not too bad. Without the coating of the Elixirs, they are better as strings. They are not strong enough on a lot of sounds though.	-1
This is a rock solid shock mount. The mike screws on tightly, and is held very securely. The materials & construction of this mount are top grade, and it has a heavy, quality feel to it. The pop filter is in exactly the right place and is mounted on a very sturdy arm which is fully adjustable.	-1
20 gauge broke as i was tuning good thing i had a spare	-1
I truly believe that they are counterfeit. Every .012 string or the 1st String that I tried to tighten broke on me with least resistance.  Mess with me once.......Shame on you !  Never Again !	-1
Bought 4 packs of these to try as an add-on purchase. All four sets had the G string come unwound during gigs. Will not be buying these again. Too bad, they sounded ok. Get what you pay for I guess.	-1
Great strings. Shipping made them 2bucks more than local price.	-1
Tried these, but the low A broke within 45 minutes of practice playing on my 12 string acoustic just after re-string. It snapped over the saddle, something that I've never had for a low wirewound string. I've had the high G break near end of life, but never had a string go out when brand new. Compared to D'Addario Extra Lights I normally use, they are heavier gauge, the sound is bright and quite metallic, maybe a bit more body to the sound than the D'Addario's, and not bad in my opinion. But they are coming straight back off. Can't afford to risk a string going at the next gig. Back to the D'Addario strings for me.	-1
After reading the reviews I thought these might work nice.  I could always enjoy a better bass response, but there isn't a continuity to the strings as in the standard strings.  To my ear it sounds very unbalanced between a nice bass and it makes the higher strings sound tinny.  If you only play in the key of G, the G C D and Am sound great.  For the key of E, E and B sound pretty good, but A is "iffy".Where the tone really goes astray is in an F chord - "yuck"  D minor doesn't sound too good either.	-1
Despite what the other reviewer stated, I have serious doubts about the construction of this mute.  It's basically cardboard with a wood base. I don't know how DW can call this "fiber".  In 2013, when one talks about fiber, one is talking about woven materials that are strong, durable, man-made materials.  While this is clearly man-made, it's neither strong nor durable, in fact it came with a soft spot in it already, likely where someone pressed on it too hard with a finger or thumb.  Dennis Wick makes a far better mute, the DW5531, that doubles as both a cup and straight mute.  While it's more expensive, it's far better made and offers both standard mutes that every trumpet player should have.  If you can't afford the DW5531, but the old standard Harmon J1 Triple Play Combo Trumpet Mute.	-1
I am a bit disappointed, especially for an American Made product. After installing these strings, they all sound "flat" like old strings do when they start going bad. The 3rd string is not bronzed wrapped and sounds badly out of place when tuning, plus they won't stay in tune for a single short song. I guess it's back to Martin Strings for me, these are awful.	-1
From electric  to these 120% let down everytime  idk maybe it's me but they always sound  dead  break halfway through sets .... Always go back to ghs burnished and blue steel acoustic last forever and bright in your face sound	-1
These strings sounded terrible. I am frugal and try to make anything work, but I had to take them off and throw them away almost immediately. You just can't get the right sound with these. The problem may be that the G string isn't wound - at any rate, it's not wound (as it should be), and it doesn't sound right. Fretting an F chord just sounds dissonant, and no song sounded right. Do yourself a favor and stay FAR away from these strings.	-1
I'm a long time musician, and a long time user of Ernie Ball Strings (on electric guitars). Unfortunately, I can't endorse these strings, even though they sound great and the light gauge saves my fingers. The problem is that they break, in my humble opinion, excessively easily. I put a set on and broke a g string within 2 days of moderate use. It snapped near the saddle, so I didn't think much of it. I replaced the set, and within a few more days I noticed that the wrapping on the g string was broken and becoming unraveled near my third fret. I bought 7 sets, so I still have 5 more sets to go through, but honestly I'll probably go back to elixirs when these are gone, since they seem to last longer.  *update* I purchased these strings on 12/19. It' now 1/18, and I've broken 3 strings from 3 different packs. At this point, I really hate these strings.	-1
I waited well over a week for these strings, just to finally get them installed and the high E string to snap. When to Guitar Center to get 3 packs of Martin lower-gauge strings. I really love Ernie Ball strings, but these are so light in gauge that they belong on an electric. So in trying to avoid a long drive, I waited over a week to get these strings, then had to drive to GC anyways. Long-story-short, just buy a crap-load of strings all at once.	-1
My first time straying from Elixirs for a long time.  I got these in a pinch and figured they would be alright for a short while.  Put them on and almost tuned up.  The 3rd string core wire snapped while tuning up. Almost made it to G.  Yes, standard G w/ tuner".  Oh I was so PeeD!	-1
Ugh - didn't like these strings at all.  Not a good feel or tone, in my opinion.  Perhaps, it's for a certain kind of guitar player.  I'm primarily rhythm, with the occasional lick here and there and have been accustomed to coated strings.  I wouldn't buy these again.	-1
I don't like the feel or sound of these strings.  I bought both the .010 and the .011 and they both hurt my fingers and sound like tin foil.  I would not buy these again	-1
These strings are not good strings. They are impossible to keep in tune and sound dull and lifeless one day after putting them on. I thought there was a problem with my Snark Guitar Tuner because I just couldn't keep these strings in tune, then when I replaced them with Martin strings problem solved. It was disappointing because I have used Ernie Ball strings on my electric guitar for years and never had these issues. To be honest I still have a few sets that I will have to throw away, I wouldn't even give them to anyone because they would be driven to drink trying to tune their guitar.	-1
I was told they would be warm sounding and that is not true. Too bright and thin sounding. Go for Martins instead.	-1
I purchased these strings and put them on my Alvarez, Even after 3 weeks they were still constantly going out of tune. I couldn't even play three songs without having to retune. I'm going back to my Martin 80/20's.	-1
I do not see how this gets such good reviews. They sound tiny to me also. I do not like expensive strings either. I will not be trying these again for a long while. I will try some other brands. If you do get these, I advise not to get over one package at a time. I do not believe the good reviews.	-1
Ordinarily I try to buy only top name strings and don't bother with cheap ones, but I bought these strings on the advice of another player.  I had been using D'Addario EXPs, which have given me great service.  So this change, I tried Earthwoods and had 2 out of 12 strings break while installing them.  The Earthwood skinny G string snapped before it even got close to a G. It is quite uncommon for me, with the strings I normally buy, to have a brand new string snap.  I've been playing for a couple of decades now, and was even using a headstock tuner, so over tightening was not an issue. I continued stringing....only to have one of the B strings snap as well... long before it was close to a B. Fortunately, I save my old strings aside -- just for this eventuality -- so I re-installed two of my old strings and was able to get playing.  (Note - the D'Addarios did not break!) The Earthwoods sound alright once installed (remember, I have two D'Addarios on there) however I doubt I will bother with these again. I don't like mixing old and new strings, and don't feel a need to put up with brand new strings breaking.  I'll play it this way until I can get to the store for another set of D'Addarios.	-1
Phosphor Bronze strings feel and sound horrible.	-1
Fender changed the strings and they no longer come with black silk wrapping on the ends, which is the reason why I bought these.  Fenders change means I will no longer buy their strings.  It's a shame they don't advertise such change.  They also do not have the same tone as they old strings, these are less unique and sound more like D'Addario XL's now, which I can buy for $6 cheaper.  Save your money and buy other strings, Fender ruined these in the name of profits I suppose.	-1
you've seen the colorized strings out there, these are just painted black. they took a cheap set of roundwounds and dipped them in black paint, nothing smooth or warm about them. These are NOT tape wound, there is no tape on these. The G string lost its brightness within a week, I put them on two basses to see if it would make a difference but nope.	-1
Sorry Guys These strings were the worst tapewounds or not. From day one, gig one, my G string was not even half volume, D followed shortly after. I just finished taking them off and replacing them with what was on there to confirm it wasn't my bass. Acctually, they feel like spray painted strings if you wanta what know the truth, years ago I played tape wounds that well... were literally coming off in ribbons after awhile. Its ok live and learn.	-1
I use an XLR cable so the only good thing about this stand is that it holds the guitar high enough off of the ground to accommodate the jack.  Otherwise, NOT at ALL suitable for stage use.  My guitar cable and guitar strap wrap around the base or the back so it is a tangled mess whenever I pick it up.  I can't imagine even using it at home if you keep a strap attached.  It doesn't take much to knock it over.  In fact I was playing an outdoor gig at the Virginia Beach oceanfront.  A breeze kicked up and blew the guitar & stand  over taking a nice chunk out of the headstock -- good thing it wasn't my favorite guitar.	-1
Put scratches on the front of my 6 string dreadnaught guitar. Not a good but.	-1
I broke my machine head by forcing this behemoth of  a string in to it. Then once I cut and placed the string the darned thang unwound and would NOT grip. Destroyed string AND MY TUNING PEG!  Heed all warnings on this product. I've been doin' this stuff for 45 years and ain't never seen nothin' like this bull before... Bad Fender... Bad!	-1
nice because it folds up small and is light weight.. but it is flimsy and bends out of whack pretty easily. Gotta be careful when using it. I won't put my good guitar on it.	-1
I use to use these strings in 4th grade for my violin and they were great..I just got my string set today and the D string was lose and the damn thing snapped on me...what crap...I wish i could get my $14 back!	-1
These strings would be o.k. for a beginner to the violin since you don't want to invest too much in something that may be a passing hobby.  I found I did not like these strings even on my cheap violin and I could not get a good sound out of them.  They are thin and sound cheap even though they cost quite a bit which like most cheaply made strings for the violin they always sound like banjo strings to me.  For beginners these strings would be good especially for people with children who play.  I am still a beginner and I can't bring myself to play with these strings anymore now that I have found better sounding ones.  Though it comes with all four just get ready for the sound they make when played.  Some people like them I guess but me I can't bring myself to recommend them unless you don't mind sound for someone starting out.  If you like them then have at and buy more but for me its merely two stars and not worth it for me.	-1
A friend of mine played one in a band setting. Man, that bass is not good sounding at all! First, it sounds like a P-bass, But with lots of uneven volume dips in the neck. The bass sounds cheap, and doesn't have much lows. It sounds okay when the strings are brand spanking new. Probably because you can hear the brights directly from the strings. But once they start wearing, the thing only gives you mid tones. Low volume Lows, and almost no highs at all.  It's a good bass for $75. Perhaps even $125. But for $199, get a squier, which gives you decent tone and good playability!	-1
A cheap bass is exactly what it is. Fret buzzing abounds and the hardware is questionable at best. Let the buyer beware with this mediocre offering from Ibanez. All in all, a very disappointing piece of equipment from a company that has been around for years now. They should be able to make an inexpensive starter bass that delivers decent quality at a low cost, but I guess that's not in their best interest. I would highly recommend that you save up a few more dollars and go for something better than this. I regret my purchase each and every time the strings vibrate against the frets.	-1
First some background: I've been playing bass for 2 years have used Line 6, Eden, Peavey, Marshall, Orange and Kustom amps and Ibanez, Peavey, JB Player, Fender, Yamaha, Epiphone and Squire bass'. wanted to give Ibanez a chance (My second bass was an AEB10E which I LOVED) when I began looking for my newest electric purchase but was sorely disappointed.  While the guitar has a nice thin neck and light (agathis) body it has thin sound.  While that might work for rhythm or lead it doesn't cut it for the LOW-End.  The electronics are nice but the tone just isn't there.  For $200+ you should be able to find a superior bass with a deep low end.  If you're really looking for a beginning bass I would recommend a Yamaha RBX 170, same price but better tone (despite having Passive electronics).	-1
This stand is very portable and compact, but I no longer have confidence in it's ability to keep my electric basses safe. My vintage Fender Jazz Bass would not fit correctly due to the offset body shape and a few years ago it fell over causing significant damage to the headstock (see picture). After this, I resigned to use this stand only with my Fender Precision Bass which has a more symmetrical body shape, but even this bass has come close to falling over if not placed just so. I've decided to go back to the more traditional type of guitar stand for my instruments.	-1
Shocking that Fender's stand was made so poorly it could scratch my Fender!	-1
My MIM Fender Strat awkwardly sits on this thing. Seems like it will slide off. Don't plan to use it.	-1
Won't hold my ernie ball bass, nor any other instrument I own.... It is strictly designed for a tele or strat (so it seems). I couldn't even give this away. I asked two of my friends and they both said no thanks...	-1
...for something, but not a guitar.  Wasn't sure what to do with it so I now use it to mount a large cookbook, or notepad computer, so I can follow a recipe.  It seems to work okay for that.  Just don't use this for guitars.  An electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far, and the arms have no grip.  This thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project.  It may even give you AIDS!  But probably not.  However, animals could have been harmed in the making.  But most likely, and in reality, it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner.	-1
Total flimsy junk. It leans WAYYY too far back. I'll be damned if I put my $1000 guitars on these things. On the other hand, ChromaCast makes one that's very close to this price, and I doubt that it could have been more for the money I paid.  In summary... DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK.	-1
This is fine for a regular sized electric guitar but too big for a mini guitar. That said, it seems to be fairly well constructed and it was cheap.	-1
It is not the size for mini guitar. May be for the big one...Connections are shaky. You will surely notice that the quality is toooo low.	-1
Very disappointed guitar came damaged with dents and scratches it deffenatley not new guitar.	-1
I tried it with an SM57 on snare and the knob that holds the arm loosened after about 7 songs so the mic was laying on my snare drum. I assume this is due to the higher frequency vibrations on that drum. On toms, it is suitable but it still doesn't offer much flexibility for mic placement. The arm is octangular shaped and I could never get my Beta56 microphones in a great location. I would rather use an LP Claw or not clamp to the drum than use this.	-1
These say they have a huge range per their specs but I don't buy it.  I have a pair and they broke on the right can because of my big head sound still works but they are junk.  I have a new pair of headphones but I won't say what they are in this review but they are like night and day.  I used Tangerine Dream, Legend soundtrack to do a compare.  Pioneers lost bigtime.  Using my laptop as a driver I now have another 3500mw max set of cans and they are amazing when compared against the old Pioneers.  The Pioneers were quiet and I had my ears in the cans even pulled out the Tip a bit no deal on the louder sound I am getting from my new set.  Dont waste your cash on this plastic made in china unless you like hearing less.	-1
You wrote that I should get manual, and another items, and I didn't.	-1
Thought I would give coated strings a try, and to be honest, i'm not a fan. Tone quality was good, but it was extremely difficult to play without vibration coming from the frets. I stuck it out for a couple of weeks, but I ended up switching to the D'Addario phosphor bronze, and I will NEVER switch back. Uncoated strings play much better. I know there are some people out there who swear by these coated strings...but I honestly don't see why.	-1
Had a terrible time figuring out how to put this contraption on and haven't used it since purchasing.  Maybe I will spend some more time with it later in an effort to get the hang of it.  Might just be me, but I imagine that others will have problems with it too.	-1
I bought the bass version of this strap and it is not long enough for someone who likes to wear their bass lower.  I typically have my bass closer to my waist but this strap isn't long enough to go lower than chest high.  I am 6'3", so if you are a taller person avoid this strap unless you like wearing your bass really high!	-1
Item too short, with no way to extend ; make sure you get the right fit when you order. measure twice order ONCE	-1
These stings do not keep tune well even after stretching and feel harsher than non coated strings. Coating also begins to peel off within the first couple days leaving frayed bits of plastic on the strings....	-1
Bought this for my Deering banjo and guess what? It's not compatible with Deering. After half hour struggling i could install it but it is not comfortable at all. The strap is really heavy and not flexible. It relieves some of the pressure but still uncomfortable to carry around.  I removed it directly and have ordered an original Deering strap.	-1
I found this neck strap difficult to adjust and too stretchy to hold its length once adjusted.  I returned it.	-1
OK, but I prefer D'Addario	-1
I bought these hoping it would last longer than 3 months without rusting. It didn't. I wipe the strings after playing and keep my guitar in a hard shell case and still I could feel rust on the strings after less than 2 months, so for me it's not worth the extra cost.	-1
These were not fresh strings. They really lacked the good tone you expect from new Elixir strings. The price was good and delivery was quick	-1
I am older and I bought this harness to take the weight of the tenor sax off of my neck.  I am of fairly average size for an adult male, 5'10' tall, 160 lbs., and I can not adjust this harness to feel comfortable ---the side straps cut into my lats.  The harness is also difficult to adjust to have the mouthpiece come up to my mouth; instead I end up getting it sort of close to where I want the mouthpiece to be, and then bend my neck to bring my mouth down to the  mouthpiece (and this is not how you want to play the sax).  I should have returned this product, but I tried to make it work.  The basic Neotech 1901162 for about $11 to $16 is better, but be careful selecting the size.  For tenor sax players you are likely to need the X-Long, which really isn't very long.  The "regular", is just a little too short for tenor ----Neotech could have easily added a few inches of material to the "regular" size and it would have worked for most people for both alto and tenor sax.	-1
Ernie Balls wear too quickly. Maybe I am just a ham-fisted strummer? IDK? They seem to wear really quick no matter the gauge.	-1
I should have read the other reviews,the strap is only 3 feet long,the name is quite misleading, so my fault not theirs but I cant imagine anyone besides students being able to use this.	-1
Super short...I put this on with the strap fully extended and the bass was literally resting on my upper chest. Perhaps if you are 4-5' tall and weigh 80-100 lbs, this would be ok... I normally wear my bass fairly high but this was still too short.  The neoprene shoulder portion is ok...stretches a little bit and seems like it would be comfortable.  The bottom half of the strap is el cheapo nylon and the end pieces are typical of a $5 strap.  Overall, I don't care for this strap even if it was long enough to use. The neoprene section is ok but the rest is really pretty cheapo in it's construction. I realize it's only a $23 strap...but I don't think it's a good value at that price point.  I returned it.	-1
I can't figure out to use it!!!	-1
THIS STRAP IS NO SOFTER THAN THE STRAPS THAT COME WITH MOST INSTRUMENTS AND POSES NO POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE OVER THE STRAP INCLUDED WITH YOUR HORN.	-1
I really wanted to like this; really wanted it to be good, but I couldn't make it work with my body. Even at the highest setting it wasn't high enough to comfortably play. Too bad.	-1
I really thought I was going to like this pickup (MIM Tele) but I don't like the sound at all.  I think it's misleading considering it's a humbucker.  It sounds really thin.  It's not great for smooth warm tones at all but it's pretty decent with some distortion.  I wouldn't recomend it to a friend and I've already sold it.  I realize its a mini humbucker	-1
D String snapped while beginning tuning. I think it was made wrong by accident	-1
The only saxophone I can use with this strap is my curve soprano, its to short, do not want to take time to exchange.	-1
I purchased these strings about a week ago and I put them on my acoustic guitar the minute they arrived. Now, I have noticed a buzzing from the G string! Previously I have purchased the Nanoweb strings from Elixir and those would last for up to 2 and a half months! I do not play with a heavy strum and the string is doing this already....? Definitely something wrong here. I would NOT buy this product again!	-1
Sure a more expensive brand cable might be better made, could last longer, and might have a better warranty, but as far as sending signal from your mics to your preamps, they sound just the same as their budget counterparts. EVERY musician feels their hearing is better than a dogs. Reality says, compare any recording and tell me what cable they used :-)	-1
These strings are great when you play power chords, but if you want to play a solo or something that requires playing a single note at a time, the rest of the strings will start playing without me touching them. It's annoying and a tried to fix it by lowering the Gain on my amp, but it didn't work. If you're a beginner like me (2 years playing) I sugest lighter strings. I love playing metal songs and I guess I thought the heavier the better, but I was wrong. Elixer is a great brand, but I will get lighter strings next time.	-1
Perhaps I'm unjust in supposing that this strap was designed by a Tea Party Congressman. It IS plainly designated as a sax strap, but I was directed to it while searching for a bassoon strap. Still, I tried it on my tenor sax and I would have the same complaints if I'd purchased it for that instrument. First of all, it claims to be XL. It isn't; it's barely long enough for alto sax or a tenor played by a small person. Second, it's not quickly adjustable; if you play only one instrument, that wouldn't matter, but a strap at this price should be more practically designed. Third and most important, the clip is plastic junk! It won't stand up to professional or avid amateur use for long. And it's too fat! The hook won't slip into the typical metal eyes on most instruments, or it slips in only partially and therefore insecurely. Look for something else, musician friends! It's probably worth your while to go to a good old-fashioned music shop, where you can see what you're getting	-1
They sound good, but they break too easy... If you want to change your stings 3 times a show, get these!	-1
I had neotech before and was the best thing since toasted bread. However these new editions are way too short, the hook has to go to the very end to reach a comfortable position. I was dissapointed.	-1
I am not a fan of the generic neck straps that come with most saxophones.  So when I saw this product it seemed like what I wanted comfort at an affordable price.  I like the fabric and the construction is very sound but it is simply too short for a Tenor sax player over 6ft.  It the lowest adjustment it still is tight.  I thought of returning but it looks like they have no product that has a longer adjustment.  So I will probably have to send it back for a refund.	-1
OMG  Bad sounding, they sound dead,  got a fake set from china, yes there out there! or maybe Elixirs sound this way going back to the greatest Sounding strings  D'Addario	-1
Strings unfortunately oxidized almost completely in less than a week...  I've purchased elixir 80/20 bronze nano web strings before from guitar center, and they lasted months before even a hint of oxidation. These on the other hand are practically garbage after 5 days of being on the guitar with light use. Disappointing..... I'll have to replace them with ones from a store I can trust has good quality.	-1
The high "E" string in my set broke almost immediately after stringing. I don't think I've broken a string in over 10 years using D'Addario and DR Strings.	-1
DID NOT FEEL RIGHT	-1
I'm a pro player, play various saxes on gigs, & was looking forward to getting my new strap. I have used Neotech straps ever since they first came out, but it had been a few years since I purchased one. However, upon opening it and putting it on, it felt nothing at all like they used to. It seemed very cheaply put together, and almost like they left off the inner & outer layer of material. They were kind of spongy & bouncy, thus their claim of reducing the feel of the weight of the horn. Well this feels stiff, has very little cushioning, and will take quite a while to actually sit on my neck, as it is now so stiff, it just wants to remain straight. I am very, very disappointed in this, Neotech's quality has gone way down hill, and I will be returning it.	-1

I don't get the hype. This is my 3rd pair and same experience every time. They sound dead out of the package on my Taylor 214ce; these are supported by Taylor too. I went for the 80/20s after trying the PBs and still no brighter.  I'm coming from John Pearse strings and those have much more shimmer and definition. The Elixirs sound tight and make any guitar sound either laminated, or more laminated. On a Taylor 214 these sound about the same as a 3-4 day old John Pearse 8020 set.	-1
This is a great strap for an ALTO sax.  It is too short for a tenor sax.  There is a longer model with the closed hook which I think would work on the tenor sax, and I would order one if it was offered on this site.  I think it would be very comfortable if it were long enough for my tenor.	-1
I have used these strings exclusively for many years. The latest order looked like they'd been played for years and then repackaged. Greeish and totally dead. Worthless.	-1
Two stars because I selected the wrong type of strings for a classical guitar. Otherwise I believe an excellent product for another guitar.	-1
Thought I would give coated strings a try, and to be honest, i'm not a fan. Tone quality was good, but it was extremely difficult to play without vibration coming from the frets. I stuck it out for a couple of weeks, but I ended up switching to the D'Addario phosphor bronze, and I will NEVER switch back. Uncoated strings play much better. I know there are some people out there who swear by these coated strings...but I honestly don't see why.	-1
As soon as I took the strings out of the package, it was obvious that they were used strings.  They were already cut and had kinks where they would normally contact the bridge and the tuning peg.  I will not be buying strings from Amazon anymore.	-1
they are ok - but the regular ones are just as good	-1
every single E string that I bought popped at the bridge...	-1
These were not fresh strings. They really lacked the good tone you expect from new Elixir strings. The price was good and delivery was quick	-1
I've had to stop using this brand on 2 occasions. I tried them years ago on electric, and recently on acoustic. They repeatedly break too easily and quickly.	-1
I was curious about trying these out since I have been using D'addario strings for around 8 years. One of my strings broke in the middle as I was putting these on! I can't understand how it would break in the middle of the string without even having really been tuned or tightened yet. I'm disappointed. Going to see if I can get a spare sent to me or something as the rest of the strings do sound well.	-1
Reason for 2 stars is simple. My guitar does not have a string-breaking problem, but the high E string broke after a couple of days of fairly gentle use, down at the bridge end. Hard to tell whether it was on the bridge itself because the nylon contracts unlike a steel string. No complaints about the tone, but I expected something more durable, or include an extra E (and maybe B) string if they are that delicate.	-1
D String snapped while beginning tuning. I think it was made wrong by accident	-1
I purchased a set of these already knowing that I don't like Ernie Ball sTeel strings, but now I don't like Ernie Ball nylon strings either. The g-string is the flattest, dullest sounding I've ever heard. In its defense, the 3 wound strings sounded marvelous, but 3 out of 6 isn't good by my standard. Don't waste your money with these unless you are stringing a guitar for someone you don't like.	-1
Sounds great and feels good to play, but the high E string has broken without playing much on 2 guitars and 3 packs of strings. It always breaks about 1" from the ball and. I've had traditional tie my long on for years without a snap.	-1
I purchased these strings about a week ago and I put them on my acoustic guitar the minute they arrived. Now, I have noticed a buzzing from the G string! Previously I have purchased the Nanoweb strings from Elixir and those would last for up to 2 and a half months! I do not play with a heavy strum and the string is doing this already....? Definitely something wrong here. I would NOT buy this product again!	-1
I slung these on a nylon string guitar and the high "E" string ball end popped right off after about an hour of playing. There was plenty of string left because I didn't clip it though so I just tied it like a traditional nylon string. Just a pain that the ball popped off. Nothing about the sound grabbed me so I'll try some different strings next time.	-1
I play tenor banjo, and there's a lot of high-speed strumming involved.  I'm mostly a finger picker on 5-string and guitar, so I don't have the most reliable grip for strumming.  I thought this pick would give me the confidence to wail on the tenor banjo without worrying that my pick would go flying (again).  But the flimsy loop, pick angle and overall dimensions just don't work.  I tried putting the loop on different fingers, putting the pick on upside-down and twisting it to reduce the length, even putting the loop on my thumb.  I just couldn't find a configuration that felt secure and put the pick at the correct angle for me.  Bummer.	-1
Worst strings I ever bought.  So stiff broke one when putting them on. An A string came unwound during a performance.  That never happened to me before! Super expensive and super poor quality. Go to cheaper Elixirs or D'Adarrios	-1
Good job - you just lost a customer of 25 years. If you want me to update my review, send me a bunch of free packs of 9's to prove to me that this was just a bad batch, otherwise I don't have time to spend on companies that have abandoned any quality control measures. Oh, and before you ask, nothing was set up differently on my LP Standard. The only difference was your botched strings. Can you imagine the nightmares you've caused on stage when you go to change out your 9 and the next one unravels just like the one before it?  Since I see this bundle (suspiciously) no longer makes economic sense, this review probably won't even matter. Oh well, I do what I can. Maybe I'll post on some forums as well.	-1
Nasty strings with a poor feel and a cheap metallic twanging sound one would expect from a coffee can banjo than a quality bass instrument.  None of the rich thumping sound the instrument demands.  Highly disappointed at the poor quality of these strings, which are not worth the price.	-1
After hearing a lot about how Elixirs stay alive for longer than other strings and potentially save me money, I decided to give it a shot and bought a set.  For starters, the A string snapped on me with barely any tension on it. Yes, the A string, not the G that tends to snap in a lot of string sets, but a relatively heavy A. I got a replacement for that (also an Elixir, as I prefer all strings to stay same-set).  But then I found that they all sound relatively dull and lifeless out of the box. Well, I thought maybe I need to wait for them to settle in, but time really did not help with it. The strings lack a lot of sustain and volume, especially on the bass. Treble is... eh, it's okay at best.  Overall, a huge disappointment, especially for the price. About the only good thing I can say about them is... umm... I guess they bend fairly easily? Never buying Elixirs for my guitar again. Pretty much every other make rolls out better strings.	-1
I've never broken a string changing strings on my guitar my entire life(that I can remember, ref.-age 67).  I broke two strings just changing these. I gave two stars because I'm changing them on my new SGJ Gibson electric and there is the extremely rare possibility that I may not have put them on correctly.  Can you imagine.	-1
OMG  Bad sounding, they sound dead,  got a fake set from china, yes there out there! or maybe Elixirs sound this way going back to the greatest Sounding strings  D'Addario	-1
Tried with Epiphone Special II. It wasn't tall enough and the strings automatically fretted at the 3rd fret.	-1
Way too big for the Strat, tho they claim a fit.	-1
Strings unfortunately oxidized almost completely in less than a week...  I've purchased elixir 80/20 bronze nano web strings before from guitar center, and they lasted months before even a hint of oxidation. These on the other hand are practically garbage after 5 days of being on the guitar with light use. Disappointing..... I'll have to replace them with ones from a store I can trust has good quality.	-1
DID NOT FEEL RIGHT	-1
String broke after a day...Waste of money.	-1
I don't get the hype. This is my 3rd pair and same experience every time. They sound dead out of the package on my Taylor 214ce; these are supported by Taylor too. I went for the 80/20s after trying the PBs and still no brighter.  I'm coming from John Pearse strings and those have much more shimmer and definition. The Elixirs sound tight and make any guitar sound either laminated, or more laminated. On a Taylor 214 these sound about the same as a 3-4 day old John Pearse 8020 set.	-1
I have used these strings exclusively for many years. The latest order looked like they'd been played for years and then repackaged. Greeish and totally dead. Worthless.	-1
I've been using Primo's for a while and love them but they're very hard to find.  Thought I try these b/c of the good reviews. Very disappointed... these reeds (and I tried 7 of the 10 to be sure) sound like I'm playing thru a towel....Muffled & weak.  On the upside, I purchased the Rico "plastiCOVER" reeds in the same order and absolutely love them !!!  They last long & provide excellent tone throughout the life the reed.	-1
Doesnt sound as bright ad Daddario	-1
My review is based on one purchase of 3-pack, so this is an account of my personal experience with this particular purchase and not a review based on extensive sampling of the brand. One out of the three reeds in the package was cracked and could not be played at all(reed case obscured the fault), one read was not cut well and will need some work and one reed appeared OK but, after playing it, I found it was much stiffer than indicated strength, so it will require more work. I found such obvious lack of quality control on part of manufacturer appalling. I bought quite of few reeds in the past (some even without brand names) and never before I was moved to write a negative review. I will never buy Rico Royal again.	-1
I rarely give 1 star reviews but I'm going to here.  These strings are overprice, over-engineered, and over-hyped.  D'Addario make a better product.  I regret wasting the money on these things.  The tone is flat and the sustain is non-existent.  It's probably the the nanoweb coating causing the issue.  IMHO&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/D-Addario-Nickel-Bronze-Acoustic-Guitar-Strings-Light/dp/B019JD0ZNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">D'Addario Nickel Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, Light</a>&nbsp;are a vastly superior product and I highly recommend everyone try them.	-1

Not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder.  Thought it would be more ergonomic and having the stringer cutter in one tool would be a plus.... but, not quiet up to par.  You'll be better off with the dollar string winder and a cheap pair of snips.	-1
When I pay $14 for a set of strings, I expect them to be way better that a $6 set.  Sadly, ELIXER is falling down in their quality control.  This most recent set of strings I bought sounded like a 6 month old set of six dollar strings as soon as I put them on the guitar.  I'm willing to pay the extra for strings that sound bell-clear AND stay that way for at least a month or two afterwards.  This is the second set of bad strings I've gotten from ELIXER.  I bought a set of "POLYWEB" strings, thinking they'd be better.  They were "dead-on-arrival" as well.  Maybe that's the intention - a 'duller' sound?  I don't know.  But "NANOWEB" have always been bell-clear and bright.  Not this time.  Let's see if I actually get a refund or credit.  Otherwise, I'm done with ELIXER.  I certainly cannot return them now that they've been put on the guitar and trimmed.	-1
I should read other reviews. Sound is not good and last e string just broken after tune. I have never seen the low quality string like this since I played the guitar.	-1
Not worth the money.	-1
Worst strings I ever bought.  So stiff broke one when putting them on. An A string came unwound during a performance.  That never happened to me before! Super expensive and super poor quality. Go to cheaper Elixirs or D'Adarrios	-1
I purchased the thinner gauge strings and they did not stay in tune, I thought something was wrong with my guitar, but switched back to another brand that was a thicker gauge and the guitar stayed in tune.	-1

You shouldn't have to buy RPS to get strings you can bend.... I have been using Ernie Ball Super Slinkies since the 1980s. I love the feel and sound they produce. but I'm done. I have seen too many .09, .10 .11 and .13 strings slip and let go lately. Could it be that it is impossible or too expensive to make them with quality US-made steel? The pictured string constantly dropped in pitch, making it unusable for playing in public and frustrating for practice. C'mon Ernie Ball, make usable strings and I will return. Any suggestions for other strings that feel and sound like Slinkies or Super Slinkies? Edited for spelling, lol...	-1
Sounded attractive as an all-on-one tool for changing guitar strings. However, the pin puller's size is much bigger than the pins on my Yamaha acoustic guitar. The winder does not turn smoothly neither. It was easier to turn the string knobs with my hands instead.	-1
very low quality. Spend a little more money if you're looking for a decent cutter	-1
Peg winder to big, slips off a lot vs my others. maybe better for acoustic. I suggest just Gettting the separate tools. To hard to use vs separate tool with longer handle. I keep hitting my hand on the other pegs since it has a short handle. Good idea ill give them that. Quality is fair and the string cutter doesnt seam to last very long.	-1
Cheap junk should have only been a dollar.	-1
I can't comment on longevity - I doubt I'll keep them on long enough to find out. I had them in my string box for a while, put them on my Les Paul and have been trying to play them. The slickness I don't mind. They feel more slippery, fine. On the wound strings, they're quiet like flatwounds. They look nice. Sound OK, a little different yet good overall. But the plain strings have a sort of polished stainless steel quality to them and seem like a totally different alloy from the customary nickeled steel. My big problem is that these 9s play more like 10s. They don't bend like 9s. It's too much work for me, hard on the fingers. There's also a peculiar unyielding feel at the point of inflection. It's like reaching for my love's hand and encountering a mannequin's.  What could be happening? I checked with a micrometer. The thickness is correct.  What if the alloy were heavier? Then for a given gauge and length, they would require more tension to come up to pitch. It has to be something like that. No lacquer on a plain string could withstand the shearing against the frets. Stainless steel's density is 8.04 while plain steel's is 7.85. That would raise tension from 5.6 to 5.8 kg. They also feel like you'd think a "spring steel" might feel. I don't believe I'm imagining it. And I don't like it.  So, if you're expecting these 9s to bend like 9s, I can't recommend them. If you're looking for the feel of 10s, maybe try the 9s, they may suit you just fine, and last forever. Since they don't offer a lighter set, I'm out of luck. They could be harder on your frets, the way stainless wears frets faster, but that's conjecture. What I do know is that they're stiff, and I like supple. They don't deserve a one star, they seem quite well made, but for me they just don't work, so it's wasted time and money.	-1
Pin puller works poorly.	-1
These are not elixir strings they are not coated with anything!!!	-1
OK	-1
String broke after a day...Waste of money.	-1
This item is good for tuning a snare drum maybe, but it doesn't go low enough for toms or bass drums.  Instructions are minimal.  Torque values are not in any recognized unit of measure, just arbitrary numbers.	-1
This has got to be the least fit winder for the job. I can't barely get one string unwound or wound on my bass without needing to stop and re-adjust the connecting screw on this. I'm not sure if this is a D'Addario manufacturing problem but I'm really displeased with the quality of this winder.	-1
This key was broken i think when i got it. No matter how i turned the tension dial, it was way too tight for good sounds. So i ordered the Evans version, i haven't received it yet, but i hear its great!	-1
I was really hoping to love this ProTorq Drum Key. My drums need tuned pretty badly after moving and having a long winter. This key does not do fine tuning though. I got my set all set up in a new room and was excited to tune them, and was left very disappointed. I am returning this because I want my drums fine tuned and this just does not do a good job of that. I will look for another drum key and see what I come across.	-1
Using a regular tuner work's better, not worth the money.	-1
Been drumming for a few years now and always tuned my drums and my church's drums by ear... I bought this thinking maybe it'd make my life easier when tuning my church's drums because those are tougher to tune then the set I have at home and sometimes before an event you wanna make sure they sound good. I also bought a drum dial just to see how they both worked and what it came down too was simple...  I honestly could do with out this, the drum dial tho, different story, I was in a time crunch and it really made a difference in time spent tuning each head, I'll never let that go, this torq tho, If it ever got lost somehow or left behind somewhere, I doubt I'd miss it or rush to purchase another one. Yeah, it's like that, plain and simple.	-1
It didn't take long for the screw that attaches the handle to come loose. I solved the problem by inserting a couple of washers between the screw and handle and handle and the cutter part. Why weren't washers installed in the first place?!	-1
String winder broke off, I'm gentle with my equiptment and have never had a string winder break.  That is until now.	-1
Waste of money...	-1
This is my experience: I used a brand new Pro torque drum key to put new drum heads on a new set of drums. That's why I bought the ProTorque.  However, it was absolutely no use in tuning the drums. The loosest setting on the dial of the drum key put too much tension on the lugs and tightened the head way above normal tuning range. The higher settings on the dial are so tight that there is no use for it. The pressure it is inconsistent and the device is just not sensitive enough to tune drums properly. Dont waste your money on this. A simple drum key works better than this device.	-1

bad intonation	-1
The reviews were VERY favorable for this drum key. Burt it does not work as advertised.  The key is fine, but the extra expense for the tension dial was not worth it - this key does not work on ANY of my tom toms on three drum sets - because it is not nearly sensitive enough.  It needs lots of tension to even start to register. Maybe this works for tightly tuned marching drums, but it did not work AT ALL on my drum sets.  I am very disappointed, as the reviews were so positive that I bought it. Too good to be true.	-1
Too many functions to put into one tool. I much prefer a small pair of diag.cutters and a cheap plastic string winder with built in bridge pin puller.	-1
The piece they sent me, is not the one from the picture, is a lower quality, made in mexico	-1
Does the job. I have to tighten the screws I'm the winder after 3 strings	-1

The package came damaged with part of the string poking through the plastic. Not only that, but the paper holding the strings appeared to be wet and the entire package must have been under something very heavy as there are deep imprints into the paper. To top it off, the strings are bent so I can't even use it. I've bought many strings off Amazon and this is the first time I've had this problem. I'll provide some photo evidence.	-1
Not worth the money.	-1
Did not fit.	-1
Worst strings I have ever used.  I put these on a high quality Taylor and the sound was all midrange.  No full sounds, no brightness, no projection.  I am returning to D"Addarios.  These strings sounds worse than completely dead strings.	-1
buyer beware! Advertising is misleading. Product does not fit stratocaster!	-1
Not so great, they really don't cut very well.  I use cutters I bought at the hardware store.  These are junk.  1 star.  Don't waste  your time.	-1
This winder is adequate but nothing noteworthy.  The construction and materials are definitely on the cheap side.  When on the tuning keys, the fit is very sloppy and loose.  I like the idea of having a combination string winder and cutter, but this only performs these tasks marginally well.  I can't say as i would recommend this.	-1
Ordered a Fender nut and got violin string resin.	-1
If you play punk, or noise than these might be for you... they are lifeless, with no tone or warmth... They are durable, yes, you can play smells like teen spirit without worrying about breaking a string... But there is absolutely nothing to these strings... how are they the number one selling strings on the market? well, I guess it's like Mcdonalds, ... they dominate but that doesn't mean there is any sign of quality for those with ears to hear...  Go for some GHS Boomers, or D'addarios... These Earnie Balls are garbage, pure garbage.	-1
I own this identical Planet Waves Pro string winder that I bought three years ago.  I have so many guitars now, I wanted a new one, so I purchased the same thing in January 2017.  What a disappointment!  The thing is not at all like the old one.  I could tell the minute I took it out of the package.  The plastic is cheaper, lighter material, and the clipper end/hinge is made of thin tin now.  The hinge is not as smooth.  The one from just three years ago from Planet Waves was heavier duty all the way around.  Planet Waves has cheapened their overseas supplier to make a buck.  I will not be buying another of these string winders, and am reluctant to buy further Planet Waves/D'Addario products from here on out.	-1
I purchased the thinner gauge strings and they did not stay in tune, I thought something was wrong with my guitar, but switched back to another brand that was a thicker gauge and the guitar stayed in tune.	-1
making loud noise	-1
The polywebs for my Martin 000-17SM were not a good fit. I will stick with the Nanoweb 80/20's Just my taste and feel	-1
I bought this for myTaylor 214CE , I was hoping to get a little lighter string that would give a little easier to finger but they just sounds way to bright and just the tone is terrible sounding I wouldn't put these on your taylor even though I read all over these where good for the Taylor I didn't like the tone at all	-1
This is a flimsy, hollow shell of plastic.  It is an authentic Fender product, but I am so disappointed in the quality.  I'm not going to bother putting this piece of junk on my new Precision bass.  I knew it was going to be made of plastic, but I never would have expected it to be so thin.  It needs to be solid or just much thicker because the sides will cave in on it with even just a little pressure.  Also, the plastic is molded with low quality, you can see all the nasty flow lines in the plastic - much worse on this than even on cheap toys.  I' m not going to drill holes in my bass for this junk. For this purchase, I feel that Fender Musical Instruments Corp. ripped me off!	-1
At first, I thought it would be great to have extra light strings on my guitar.  I have a GS Mini Taylor.  Well, disappointment!  They didn't stay in tune at all.  I found myself tuning between each song, and my conclusion is I wasted the money.  I went to a guitar store and they put on the Elixer  light strings.  The sound is 100% better!  I have played at least 10 songs so far and minor tuning at most.  I don't know what the extra lights are for, but certainly not my type of guitar!  The mediums were recommended in the user manual, but I found barring difficult.  Much easier with the Elixer lights.	-1
Didn't like it.	-1
I installed staggered locking tuners, which actually made these a moot point.  But instead of having two screw holes in the headstock, I got these just for looks.  They look alright, but I'm not inordinately impressed.  They certainly look nicer than the stamped stock ones, they look like they produce less friction, but I don't believe they have rollers, they merely have a knob on each side the string runs under.  If you're really going to use them, you might want to keep looking until you run across some with real rollers.  I thought these had rollers.  They appear to and I've read in blogs they do.  Otherwise for looks and bragging rights, these say "FENDER" (add$$).	-1
Junk i gave it away	-1
The rest works about as you'd expect, but the pin puller is a terrible design.  It only fits the pins on about half of my guitars, and provides Zero leverage.  I have no idea why they changed the design from having the peg puller be part of the winder, but it's a serious fail.  You'd be better off getting a $2 Dunlop 100SI winder/peg puller, and a small set of wire cutters. I have a couple with the old design, and really hate to see a great product ruined.  This is going in the trash.	-1
Cutting edges need to be sharper. And very awkward to use when pulling pins	-1
Didnt look good on my guitar.	-1
Poor quality, cheeply made. Lack of quality control.  Fender should be ashamed for allowing their name on this product. 3rd world manufacturer definately,  not US made.  Became full of returns as well.	-1
Very bad finish lots of defects and chrome is Pelling off.	-1
This thing is absolute garbage. They should update the picture, it doesn't look anything like that anymore either. Now, the clipper disappears into the handle. The bridge pin puller is too wide, and thin, so it's also weak and mostly useless. This is a very poorly designed product.	-1
I built a partscaster.  When I got these string guides, I was very disappointed.  If you look close at the picture, you can see what appears to be some roughness along the sides of the part.  One of the two that came in the package I got was rough like that all over.  There wasn't a smooth, shiny surface on any part of it!  It went right into the trash, because it was unusable.  I only planned on using one of them anyway, so I moved ahead with the other one. That other one had a good enough finish...but the spindle upon which the strings rest wasn't centered!  So, imagine you've got this mounted exactly half way between your E and B strings, but the depression where the strings rest is right up against the side of the guide on one side, and 3/16" away from the side on the other side!  I at first thought this one was trash, too, until I noticed that the spindle is actually a separate piece pressed into a hole in the main body.  I was able to push that pin back to the center using my vice and a pair of vice-grips.  It wasn't easy, though, because I had to pad the whole thing with leather strips to keep from messing up the chrome plating.  I got it to work, but I'd never buy them again...or if I did, I'd by several pairs, hoping that I'd come up with a couple usable ones out of the bunch.	-1
Cutting blades OK but NOT impressed with the pin puller.  That part didn't work at all.  As a result of frustration at marring the brigde I found a Superior pin puller (ck my other reviews please) at Amazon and walked this one to the rubbish.	-1
They're inexpensive enough and are better than the vintage style trees, but since they don't roll and aren't graphite, they require lubricating every time you change strings. I should have just bought the Tusq ones.	-1
Bought these to add to a 90s MIM Strat.  The problem is they don't place enough tension on the strings causing the strings to buzz.  Look over your guitar before using these.  You may want to place them closer to the nut to increase tension since you can't adjust the height.  Planning to buy the old vintage ones that are lower since I don't want multiple holes in the headstock.	-1
Did not fit my audio technica headshells and cartridges.  I attempted with two different; a Shure and an AT cartridge. It would have damaged either if closed.  Also, the first picture is not what was sent to me.  I  Notice, that picture does not show the case with cartridges.  It was useless to me.	-1
squeaked horribly until I added a few drops of oil  UPDATE: today it fell apart. This is garbage..I threw it away, and will buy a better one. Very disappointed.	-1
Detunes on a Paul Reed Smith with tuning locks! Not good.	-1
Worst strings I have ever used.  I put these on a high quality Taylor and the sound was all midrange.  No full sounds, no brightness, no projection.  I am returning to D"Addarios.  These strings sounds worse than completely dead strings.	-1
These are not elixir strings they aren't coated with anything!!!	-1
If you need to get ride of the guide nipple on these, just clip them, don't need to file them down, they're plastic not metal.  Other than that; they do guide the strings. However plastic fluctuates and wears down after time with strings sliding back and forth from tunings, metal doesn't wish they were metal.	-1
Bought these for my Fender Jaguar, but did not install them. Seem really cheap and I prefer to stay with the stock guides	-1
Does not trim the High E string.  That's the point of using these tuners, so that you don't have to trim the strings.  G string broke right away also.	-1
Not at all impressed with this tool.  The concept seems good at first glance, but the cutters feel awkward and clumsy to hold when using the winding portion of the tool (at least in my opinion).  I put a nick in the cutting blade from clipping the strings after a single string change, and the cutting action seemed a little awkward as well.  I do think this thing is a great thing to throw into your gig bag in case of emergency, like a broken string at a gig, which is why I'm giving it two stars instead of one.	-1
It's nothing that a pair of needle-nose pliers couldn't do. Works as it should, however.	-1
Bulls*** that you gotta spend 25 to get a 3 dollar item	-1
Looked like the chrome was cheesey and they ended up breaking but they worked while they were used in a guitar with the proper pinhole next to the screw position	-1
Don't like the sound on my Taylor 814e.  The Phosphor Bronze sound much more rich and articulate.	-1
Good replacements for existing guides of the same type. The old style function better especially if you use the tremolo. Be aware, these are very hard to mount unless you already have the same type or a suitable jig. I don't like them. Filled the holes and switched to the older style wing type.	-1
Just received these and one of the two appeared tarnished or dirty; Upon close inspection I can see that about 50% of the chrome colored coating is peeling away.  Granted, these are not very expensive parts but if they are falling apart when still unused and in the package I can only imagine how they might look in a few years!  I don't plan to even put these on my guitar; I bought these as part of the upgrading process; Not to make my instrument look shabby.	-1
The product seems to be very nice and is very clear about the life-time warranty which is cool, however the screw position in each machine is different from what is showed in the picture at amazon's website and even different from the picture in the box in which it came inside. God knows I've have tried to find out in advance the reference number of the model I needed based on screw position (there is the 45 degree and the 90 degree options) but Planet waves wouldn't let me. There are no differences in model reference numbers so far discriminating one type from the other. Then BOOM! The package arrived in Brazil (my parent's brought me) and there is no returning possibility. I guess I'll have to drill new holes in my steel stringed guitar. :-(	-1
Great feel while playing. Love the ease with which they play. But that being said all of that is useless if they don't resonate and this is the second time I've tried these strings and they simply do not resonate well. The high e string doesn't resonate well at all.  I can't get the guitar to sound good with these strings.  I have a taylor 314ce which came with theses strings.  I thought my taylor sounded great until I decided to try my old go to strings made by d'adario that cost a whole 5 dollars.  It was like night and day.  Maybe someday i will give these another shot but for now I'm content with having strings that don't offer the feel of the elixirs but have superior tone quality.	-1
First, let me explain where I'm coming from.  I had a 2006 Epiphone Les Paul that I liked, but it sounded a little muddy. I decided to switch out the pickups for Seymour Duncans - boom! Magic! I think switched out the wire - boom! More magic! Then, I decided I wanted a vibrato (aka tremolo) system on my guitar, so I got the Stetsbar bridge and was happy; it even held tune okay. However, I decided I wanted to get tuners that would REALLY hold it in tune, and I was intrigued by the Planet Waves Auto Trim locking tuners. Big mistake.  I know that no hardware is going to be absolutely, 100% perfect, so bear in mind that I'm comparing these tuners to the stock Grover tuners my Epiphone came with.  Two main problems with the Planet Waves tuners:  #1. Strings are breaking all the time! I never had this problem before, even when I installed the whammy system. I'm finding myself going through a different high E string every day - and I play in flat tuning, so it should be reduced string tension. The B string is also a common casualty.  #2. These tuners can't hold tune. The problem is most noticeable on low E, but is also an issue everywhere else. If I start a song perfectly in tune after using a chromatic tuner, I find three minutes later that power chords sound awful because low E is flat. I've tried tightening the gears - I've even used a wrench - but there's nothing I can do to prevent slipping.  I get the impression that these tuners were designed specifically for standard and heavy strings. I like light strings, though, and it looks like these tuners simply can't handles 8s and 9s the way they should.  Again, I know all tuners will eventually slip a little and you need to retune from time to time. With the stock Grover tuners that my Epiphone came with, though, I was only having to tune my guitar once or twice a week. After two months, I just gave up and replaced the Planet Waves tuners with the old Grover ones.	-1
Been doing guitar work for 45 years. Used to sell for a few different string manufacturers. I do NOT like these strings. Bought them for a customer's guitar, her request. Guess what? I still don't like them.	-1
The polywebs for my Martin 000-17SM were not a good fit. I will stick with the Nanoweb 80/20's Just my taste and feel	-1
I bought this for myTaylor 214CE , I was hoping to get a little lighter string that would give a little easier to finger but they just sounds way to bright and just the tone is terrible sounding I wouldn't put these on your taylor even though I read all over these where good for the Taylor I didn't like the tone at all	-1
I hate these strings. They are horrible sounding.	-1
Not at all what I expected from this head. It sounded hollow, empty of any tone. Im sticking to my remo powerstroke.	-1
Broke one almost instantly, then had to go to the store and buy more strings anyway.  not worth it at all in my opinion.	-1
At first, I thought it would be great to have extra light strings on my guitar.  I have a GS Mini Taylor.  Well, disappointment!  They didn't stay in tune at all.  I found myself tuning between each song, and my conclusion is I wasted the money.  I went to a guitar store and they put on the Elixer  light strings.  The sound is 100% better!  I have played at least 10 songs so far and minor tuning at most.  I don't know what the extra lights are for, but certainly not my type of guitar!  The mediums were recommended in the user manual, but I found barring difficult.  Much easier with the Elixer lights.	-1
I grew to hate these strings. I'm back to D'Addario. My 3/4 travel guitar came with these but they got twangy with very little play. I don't think they are worth anything. Strings are as personal as underwear, I know, but these just didn't float my boat.	-1
I like the sound of these on my Cordoba GK Studio Negra (pluged in)  but I need to tune the guitar every five minutes.  When I originally put on the strings I spent an hour and a half playing and tuning, like you are supposed to when your 'breaking them in', so they will stablize.  I also put them on my Walden N730 classical, that I just bought.  Again, I spent an hour and a half playing and tuning, and broke the E (1)  string as I tried to find out why this string was not sustaining as much as the other strings and the previous older strings.  There may be something wrong with this batch of strings.  I looked at the strings very closely before I put the second set on my classical and there was some real wierd voids and bumps in the nylon and areas where they were thicker and thinner.  I am no expert, is this the way it is supposed to be?  Is this just a QC issue or am I dong something wrong?.... or do other people have the same issue?	-1
Unfortunately doesn't fit Taylor guitar neck.	-1
I didn't care for this product. I tried it out while re-stringing with a set of vintage style electric guitar tuners. You know the type; the ones without a hole in the shaft, where you place that pesky, hair-thin high "E" string in the top, and start turning as quickly as you can, all the while wishing you had a third hand instead of a broken toothpick to help you? I thought having a winder like this might help, and I kinda liked the idea of having the winder and wire cutter all together. The problem was, I ended up having to spend as much effort & concentration trying to keep the winder securely attached to my tuning keys, as I did trying to keep pressure on the string to get it started correctly. Then, there was the "wobble" factor. It doesn't turn smoothly, which caused one of the screws anchoring the tuner to the headstock to wallow out and loosen. It will probably work better with non-vintage tuner's. In the end, I wish I'd purchased something else. Gave them an extra star because the snippers do work great!	-1
I'm not a novice. My gigging guitar is a Taylor 816ce, which is the guitar I purchased this for and what I'm writing about. If you squeeze to open the capo all the way (as if you're in a hurry and just want to make sure it's open) and then push it all the way onto the neck until it bottoms out (again, to make sure it's seated quickly) it's possible / very likely that the EDGE of the padding (a surface of hard rubber about 1/16 inch x 1/2 inch) will catch on the neck binding (edge of the neck) and the capo won't close all the way. This leaves the two bass strings open and puts a lot of pressure on the very small edge of the pad on your binding. Not terrible if you have a plastic binding but the binding on my 816 is maple, which could be prone to damage under this kind of pressure. Not cool.  This is a fatal design flaw. When playing live I don't have 5 seconds between songs to finesse a capo or inspect it carefully to make sure it's seated properly. These are supposed to be "squeeze and go." I have absolutely no idea where the positive reviews come from. A Taylor 816 is basically the quintessential acoustic guitar. How does a company design an acoustic capo that doesn't work well for a person who performs live with a Taylor?!?!	-1
I WAS HAPPY WHEN I GOT IT BUT WHEN I OPENED IT UP IT WAS COVERED IN SCRATCHES WITH NO PROTECTIVE COATING ON IT. IT WAS SEALED IN THE PACKAGE BUT COVERED IN SCRATCHES, I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY SINCE IT WAS AN ORIGINAL FENDER PRODUCT.	-1
I use daddario un-coated for my les Paul, these ones had buzz (I have re-adjusted my truss and action) and unbalanced tension. The sound is good but I still like the Daddario	-1
Also buy some lube cause thing squeals like a pig and gets really hot fron the friction.	-1
These are not elixir strings they aren't coated with anything!!!	-1
Mine was too hard to open easily.	-1
This is a piece of squeaky junk, and worst of all it cut me badly when clipping a guitar string. Warning: When the handle comes together after cutting a string the little prongs sticking out of the inside of the handle will cut you. see them just on the left edge of the black handle (inside edge). The handle squeaks loudly when winding guitar strings. Do I have to keep this oiled. Its going in the trash can as a lesson learned.	-1
Don't like the sound on my Taylor 814e.  The Phosphor Bronze sound much more rich and articulate.	-1
I wish Fender would enter the 21st century when it comes to pick thickness. The size and shape of this pick are exactly what I wanted and expected, but in spite of the fact that they are stamped "Extra Heavy", I wouldn't even be willing to describe them as "Medium". It's as if Fender scaled the thickness down from the 351 pick along with the other dimensions. The thinness of this "Extra Heavy" pick gives it such a brittle little sound that it's completely useless to me...except maybe to use as a template for grinding a 2mm Dunlop 500 down to the size I wish they were.	-1
Every pack we bought has broke within 1 day. The quality is poor not worth the money.	-1
bridge pin remover doesnt work at all	-1
not worth the money	-1
I don't know what the problem is with these strings.  I've been playing for 22 years and have always used Ernie Ball's.  This is the first time I'm trying 'coated' strings due to a suspected nickel allergy.  I bought 2 packs for my Stratocaster.  The high E string from BOTH packs SNAPPED at the head on the very first bend?? Threw on another set of EB's, the same exact way I have always installed my strings, and no problems.  I would think if there's a bad batch out there then Amazon would pull them from inventory.  Very disappointed.	-1
Buy the cheaper string winders. This is made well, but the design is not very universal. First problem. The part of this tool that fits over the winding key on the guitar is too large to clear the adjacent keys on my Fender Strat if the adjacent keys are parallel to the line between the keys. I can overcome this problem if I position adjacent winder keys perpendicular to the line between adjacent machines. That is fine if replacing multiple strings, but this work around requires extra steps when only one string is being replaced. Second problem. The peg puller cutout is too small to fit over the pegs in my Washburn acoustic, so that feature is useless to me. I have not yet tried the string cutter feature, so perhaps one of three features will work as expected.	-1
This product is cheap and thin. I was going to return but return costs $5.50! Bought another from GFS. Much better workmanship and grade metal.	-1
Great feel while playing. Love the ease with which they play. But that being said all of that is useless if they don't resonate and this is the second time I've tried these strings and they simply do not resonate well. The high e string doesn't resonate well at all.  I can't get the guitar to sound good with these strings.  I have a taylor 314ce which came with theses strings.

Bah. I've tried Elixirs before, a couple of times, and was never impressed at all. Today I took my Taylor 416 CE Spring Limited in to where I bought it look at a slight issue; when I bought it the first thing I did was put on my favourite strings, D'Addario phosphor Bronze 12's. The store owner, who sold me the guitar a year ago, suggested we try the factory spec strings (Elixir Nanoweb 13's) to see if anything resolved. (it didn't). Took my guitar home, kind of hoping I could like the Elixirs, and played a few hours- the salesman said they'd changed the coating since the last time I tried them many years ago. I have to say, the same issues I always felt about these strings are there. I just hate the feeling of these strings under my fingers- feel like they have Finger Ease on them and are too slick. And more importantly, I hate the tone. There is something missing- that breathy 'zing' on the top end of a fresh set of good quality uncoated strings. Who cares if they 'last longer' if the overall tone is inferior to begin with? I can change my strings more often to have what I like, thank you. I feel Elixirs are a pricey gimmick, used to keep showroom guitars holding tone a bit longer and to placate people who are too lazy to change strings regularly. Tomorrow out come the needle-nose pliers and back to D'Addarios for me. Never again.	-1
Been doing guitar work for 45 years. Used to sell for a few different string manufacturers. I do NOT like these strings. Bought them for a customer's guitar, her request. Guess what? I still don't like them.	-1
The Drum Dial dose a basic job of equalizing tension of the lugs on a drum. You still have to fine tune the drum. Where it really fails is it's durability. If it is dropped even a foot off the floor it will break and not calibrate (see photo).It feels solid but it's not. I would get something else.	-1
I have 2 of these and both have the same problem---too much spring tension. The result is they bend the strings slightly resulting in being a little sharp tuning wise. Not good when recording as it is definitely noticeable.	-1
winder keeps coming unscrewed.  Doesn't fit tuners very well on Squier strat, keeps coming of while winding.  Cutters work well.	-1
Lasts about 2 weeks and then either breaks or corrodes. I know different fingers sweat differently and have different oil compound makeup but shoot, someone needs to make a treated string that lasts more than 2 weeks. I need roadie, I'm tired of changing strings every two weeks, I know guys who don't need to change them but every 6-12 months. I wish I was that guy. These strings don't work for me and are way overpriced in my opinion. Thumbs down.  Would love to hear what works for others who share my lament.	-1
I've been using these picks since the 60's, Fender Heavy White picks. WERE my favorite picks, so I bought some here on Amazon to restock all the ones that get lost in the laundry etc. I opened up the package and plugged my guitar in and suddenly my guitar sounded dull and lifeless. I thought oh I must have the tone control rolled back, nope. I checked my guitar cord, the amp. I had a thought they changed something so looked at the package and sure enough, it now says MADE IN CHINA. So, I dug up one of my regular Fender white Heavy picks and played it and the bright biting tone I loved so much from these picks was immediately there. Shame on Fender for trying to maximize profits and cut out the American pick makers to squeeze more money out of us musicians. These picks absolutely are the worst picks I've ever tried, they absolutely kill treble response and any kind of liveliness. I thought, ok, maybe I got a bad batch, so went to Musician's Friend and ordered another batch, they were identical and sounded horrible too. This is the END of Fender picks for me, never buying any again....	-1
Both components of this tool let me down. The winder doesn't fit the tuners on my banjo, width-wise (the short axis of the winder). They aren't unusual tuners either, so I found that odd and a bit annoying. The wire cutters work, but you have to open the handles to a ridiculous angle to get the mouth open enough to make a cut. It's very frustrating. Overall, I think it's poorly designed and does nothing to ease the process of swapping wires.	-1
Okay, so I can't comment on the sound or durability cause item came with its metal rim were bent. Usually, drum heads come inside a cardboard box but for some reason this item came inside a plastic bag. Wish there were another to swap it with.  Immediately returned it got prompt credit.	-1
I read the copy and saw exactly what I wanted in the picture accompanying the advertisement. A selection of light, medium, heavy and extra heavy Fender 358 picks. I was trying a new instrument and wasn't sure what would work for me.  I received 72 Extra Heavy picks, and was insulted by the staff of the vendor when I contacted them. Lesson learned, I went elsewhere for my picks.  A management change at the original vendor's shop provided some relief, earning them the second star.	-1
Ok	-1
it was not in the package... need to find my order!!!!	-1
I bought these strings after buying some Elixir strings for my acoustic, which I was pretty happy with.  For my strat, however, these strings did not sound right from the start. After about a week I really started wondering if it was just in my head or if I really didn't have sustain that I thought I usually got from a new pair of strings.  I convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems, and I was right.  I put a pair of D'Addario XL 9.5 (highly recommended for those players who can't decide between 9s or 10s) and was amazed at how much tone and sustain I was losing with these Elixir strings.  I did feel like I could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings, but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently.  Don't let the higher price on these strings entice you, go with a good set of D'Addario or Ernie Ball strings for consistent long-lasting strings.	-1
not two weeks after I put these on the A string broke close to the ball on the string.  I break high e strings on occasion.  but something as thick as an A string?? maybe it was a defective string as I thankfully bought two sets and I was able to pull the A out of the other set and it has been fine since.  now however I have the dilemma of should I just buy more strings and just use the second set as I need them.  Further more do I stick with the same brand.  that is supposed to last longer than average strings.  At this point I am going to keep playing this set until its time to change then go from there.  I will update once I decide if I should stick with this brand or go back to super slinky's  update 3/25 well another month went by(a week ago) and the D string broke in the same fashion leaving me to believe I either got defective strings are these strings are not as good as they are said to be. either way its losing another star.  if it happens with a different set of strings I will reevaluate my guitar/review and change accordingly	-1
The roll came damaged.	-1
Low quality, but does his function.	-1
Had rust within 30 days. Disappointed	-1
I purchased this item because the reviews said these were goto tuners however the set I received was marked Korea  I didn't know goto moved to korea	-1
Strings didn't last long at all, got some minor play out of them (about five 1 hour sessions) before one snapped and yes I know how to string a guitar, been playing for close to 20 years.	-1
I use Elixir's acoustic light phosphor bronze strings on my Taylor 414ce and like them ok. I play frequently thru church pa and hoped these HD lights would give my grand auditorium a sweeter, fuller sound over the PA. Not! Strange, but they sound twangy and out of tune no matter how I fine tune my guitar. The choir director keeps asking me to fine tune my guitar since I put these on. As soon as I switched out the HD part of the strings, back to normal acoustic lights, the difference was instantly discernable and more pleasing.  I have tried these twice and will not go for three times.	-1
I put these strings on my Gretch solid body, 70's vintage.  I love the full and varied sound I can get with this guitar, can play anything with it.  I don't play as much as I used to so I thought I would try the nanoweb coating on some super lights.  Hated the sound.  Not very full, and this guitar has very rich sound.  Almost tinny.  I have never had a set of strings that were worse than these in over 40 years of playing.	-1
Doesn't look anything like the picture shows	-1
Did not have the fingers logo on these or the 1.0 mm	-1
I've tried nearly every kind of capo out there.  I wanted to try this one because I liked the trigger-type design.  However, it did not fit my hand as well as I thought it would.  Was also very stiff... stiff enough that I packaged it back up within 5 minutes and shipped it back.  Planet Waves NS capo, and my Kysers work better and are easier to adjust.  Thankful for a refund.	-1
This device is very well made, solid as steel and sexy looking. However, it claims to making tuning drums quick and convenient, and with that I'm at a loss. I play a large drum kit with mountable tom toms and bought this so that I could tune on the fly, perhaps just before a gig; from what I read, that's what it seemed to be for. The problem is the drum must lie flat so that you can rest this device on the batter surface. Thus, you must dismount each drum for tuning.  I tried it on a snare drum for which I'd just purchased a new head. I finger tightened each lug, as instructed, and then tightened one with a key just a couple spins. Oddly, the device registered 68 for that lug, and all the others. As I'd tighten one, the others would show the same tension. I'm not saying the device is defective, I just didn't understand how to make it work for me, and the very brief instruction paper was of very little value (to me).  Perhaps a seasoned pro could find value in this, or someone playing always level drums, like timpani's. I am much better off just tuning by ear, lug by lug, with all drums mounted and ready to play. So again, nothing against Drumdial or this tuner, but I do challenge their claim of 'quick' tuning, and also they really should have more detailed instructions.	-1
These break easy. I cannot recommend them.	-1
Too much spring tension. Pulls everything out of tune on every guitar except my medium stringed acoustics. Absolutely worthless on electric.	-1
These are generally my favorite strings, but I've gotten 3 sets from here that are defective or fake.  I'm not sure if it's just bad stock right now.  I've ordered these many times in the past and only started seeing the bad ones around January 2015.  I alerted Amazon after the second bad set and they briefly stopped selling them while they investigated.  I hesitated to order again, but decided with the recent good reviews that maybe the issues had been resolved  If you're familiar with these strings you know that they look, feel and sound different than uncoated strings. The ones I got were dull sounding and not the same color or feel of the real thing.  Also the packaging was slightly off in color.. sort of faded looking.  I went to guitar center and got a good set, and they price match.  I uploaded a picture which shows the comparison between the correct looking Elixir strings on the right side and the bad set on the left.  I also uploaded pictures of the front and back of the packaging.  The set from Guitar Center is on the right in each picture.  The ones from Guitar Center are custom light because they were out of light, but all of the different types of Elixir acoustic strings at the appeared to have the same background color.  Also, I want to point out that I've bought the Elixir light polyweb from here recently and they were fine.  This problem might be isolated to these specific strings in light Guage.  I haven't tried any others.	-1
After all these reviews I expected the Greatest Strings Ever, golden strands of Glory that would last for a year with sparkling tonal perfection!  Instead, I got a decent set of .10's that lasted a whole hour before the D snapped at the neck pickup. I use a PRS with a Wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks strings, and I pre-stretch them gently but completely. Plus I tune down to Eb for vocal and breakage reasons, so I break very few of my normal strings, Slinky .10's. Ergo, a break in one hour from a thick string under minimal tension, tuned down, is unacceptable, especially when these strings cost three times as much as most all other electric strings.  As for the tone, it's definitely bright and almost too edgy, but nicely zingy all told. Yet one negative I've noticed after about 8 hours' loud playing with a drummer is that these things seem to vibrate more widely than most strings, making them harder to tune. Sounds odd, I know, but when I replaced the D with a Slinky D (replacing singles ain't cheap either at triple the price, please note), I've since noticed that it tunes faster and in a tighter range than the Elixir strings.  So, I must say I'm summarily unimpressed so far with Elixir electric strings.  What's the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast? Especially when it costs three times more? And what's up with the tuning thing? And why do these cost so much more, anyhow? Is a micro-thin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string? Not when that string is toast in 50 minutes, zero doubt there.  Anyhow, I've got five Elixirs and one Slinky on my main ax now, so as they age I'll get a good feel for how the Elixirs stay in tune and hold their tone, and I'll report back here in a while. And by the way, that Slinky D sounds almost exactly the same as the Elixirs, tonally. So much for Magic Elixir Tone.  Don't get me wrong, I really do want to love these, as I hate changing strings, but geez guys, how about some quality control? If I'm going to pay triple the price, then is it crazy to expect triple the quality? Or heck, even just a little better...  PS If you look at the D'Addario reviews (I love their acoustic strings), they respond to many of the reviews and questions. I hope that Elixir will do the same here and address my questions.  [Edit: And now, after only six hours' of playing on that guitar, the B string popped at the same place as the D, neck pickup. Once again I ask: what good are strings that "sound good three times longer" if they break three times faster?]  [Edit: 10/31/12. Come on! After four more hours, the A string went. I only play that ax one or two sessions a week, and the next time I joked to the drummer, "Which one will go today?" He said he's amazed the G is still on, as he plays too and knows the G takes the most tension. An hour later, guess what? Yep. So that's four broken strings in less than 20 hours' play. Seriously?  Not only are these not a good deal for 9 bucks, I'd be bummed if they cost 3 bucks. The only plus I can think of at this point is they sounded good when new, but dang, unless you play totally smooth jazz or some such, I'd stick with Slinkies or D'Addarios. Unless I got a "bad set", which seems kinda lame for triple the normal price. In any case, these Elixirs were just not worth the money.]  [Edit, 3/3/13: I called Elixir and told them about the multiple breakage, and they sent me another set. That set has taken a few four hour hard rock sessions with no breaks yet, though the tuning issue remains. But honestly, at this price, there should be no duds at all. These are overpriced and overrated, from my experience with multiple sets.]	-1
I bought it for my classic guitar but it's too small for it. I guess it's only acoustic guitar.	-1
Every pack we bought has broke within 1 day. The quality is poor not worth the money.	-1
The strings that were sent to me were old. The sheen of the strings were faded, weren't very smooth and simply looked old. I looked at the packaging and it was dated from 2008. Now I don't claim to be a string expert, but the strings i took OFF looked newer in comparison to the "new" strings. Sadly I didn't notice how bad the strings were until I already took my old ones off. I would've just kept the old ones if I noticed. The packaging doesnt keep the strings very fresh, they're just basic paper sleeves... I would try getting your strings from a different vendor.  They still play decent but if I'm spending 15 bucks on a pair of strings, they better be fresh.	-1
I hate writing negative reviews but it has to be done.  I do not know if I got a defective pair but whenever I try to tighten my tuners it falls apart. The string snips worked perfectly.	-1
Bah. I've tried Elixirs before, a couple of times, and was never impressed at all. Today I took my Taylor 416 CE Spring Limited in to where I bought it look at a slight issue; when I bought it the first thing I did was put on my favourite strings, D'Addario phosphor Bronze 12's. The store owner, who sold me the guitar a year ago, suggested we try the factory spec strings (Elixir Nanoweb 13's) to see if anything resolved. (it didn't). Took my guitar home, kind of hoping I could like the Elixirs, and played a few hours- the salesman said they'd changed the coating since the last time I tried them many years ago. I have to say, the same issues I always felt about these strings are there. I just hate the feeling of these strings under my fingers- feel like they have Finger Ease on them and are too slick. And more importantly, I hate the tone. There is something missing- that breathy 'zing' on the top end of a fresh set of good quality uncoated strings. Who cares if they 'last longer' if the overall tone is inferior to begin with? I can change my strings more often to have what I like, thank you. I feel Elixirs are a pricey gimmick, used to keep showroom guitars holding tone a bit longer and to placate people who are too lazy to change strings regularly. Tomorrow out come the needle-nose pliers and back to D'Addarios for me. Never again.	-1
Lasts about 2 weeks and then either breaks or corrodes. I know different fingers sweat differently and have different oil compound makeup but shoot, someone needs to make a treated string that lasts more than 2 weeks. I need roadie, I'm tired of changing strings every two weeks, I know guys who don't need to change them but every 6-12 months. I wish I was that guy. These strings don't work for me and are way overpriced in my opinion. Thumbs down.  Would love to hear what works for others who share my lament.	-1
I ordered the California Clears, Been using for over 10 years & should have the palm tree (As pictured) and I just got blue Fender heavy picks. this product is NOT as described. Not going to return a $4.00 item as it will cost more to do that than to just keep them and go buy the correct ones somewhere else	-1
A bit clumsy to use.  I had something like this before and it seemed easier to use.	-1
Strings didn't last long at all, got some minor play out of them (about five 1 hour sessions) before one snapped and yes I know how to string a guitar, been playing for close to 20 years.	-1
Good wire cutter and winder, pin puller part is too fat to get under the pin.	-1
The first time I tried these strings was on March 27th 1979. Not only did I find them quite shrill, less than 24 hours later the partial meltdown at the 3 Mile Island nuclear power plant occurred.  Then years later I heard some changes had been made to this product so I thought I'd give them another shot. That was on April 25th 1986 and again less than a day later another disaster at a nuclear facility, the Chernobyl power plant in Ukraine. Coincidence? Perhaps.  Finally in early March 2011, with the advent of the newly developed "Nanoweb" coating I decided to give these strings one last try. Those poor people at Fukushima.  I would highly recommend you not use these strings and try John Pearse 200L's instead. Not only are the Elixers excessively bright, who knows what sort of disaster may be averted by not using them?	-1
Terrible.	-1
I use Elixir's acoustic light phosphor bronze strings on my Taylor 414ce and like them ok. I play frequently thru church pa and hoped these HD lights would give my grand auditorium a sweeter, fuller sound over the PA. Not! Strange, but they sound twangy and out of tune no matter how I fine tune my guitar. The choir director keeps asking me to fine tune my guitar since I put these on. As soon as I switched out the HD part of the strings, back to normal acoustic lights, the difference was instantly discernable and more pleasing.  I have tried these twice and will not go for three times.	-1
I know many people love the design, but I find it much too frustrating. You have to be very careful putting it on the fret correctly, then snap it in, then turn and turn the screw, oops don't let it snap off again and fall off while trying to turn the screw. Then you have to go through the whole routine again to take it off and move it to another fret and put it on again. What a farce. This is the worst capo I've owned, and I've tried nearly every brand and type. Yeah, I've had people show me how to do it right, and I know to do it right. It's just wrong to have to spend so much time slipping it on, snapping it, screwing it in, screwing it off, having it fall off, forget it, it's garbage to me. Also, while I'm getting my callouses worked out playing for two hours every day, the last thing I want is to pinch my fingers against metal trying to turn a screw. It's actually slightly painful to the fingers (momentarily, but why have to deal with that??) to work with. This design seems like it was a non guitar player who came up with it. The only good thing I can say about it is looks durable.  No thanks.	-1
Sound not good on yamaha apx1000. As well as the coating it immediately got stain.	-1
had a bad string out of the box  set to tune it buzzed then snap  not happy	-1
These are generally my favorite strings, but I've gotten 3 sets from here that are defective or fake.  I'm not sure if it's just bad stock right now.  I've ordered these many times in the past and only started seeing the bad ones around January 2015.  I alerted Amazon after the second bad set and they briefly stopped selling them while they investigated.  I hesitated to order again, but decided with the recent good reviews that maybe the issues had been resolved  If you're familiar with these strings you know that they look, feel and sound different than uncoated strings. The ones I got were dull sounding and not the same color or feel of the real thing.  Also the packaging was slightly off in color.. sort of faded looking.  I went to guitar center and got a good set, and they price match.  I uploaded a picture which shows the comparison between the correct looking Elixir strings on the right side and the bad set on the left.  I also uploaded pictures of the front and back of the packaging.  The set from Guitar Center is on the right in each picture.  The ones from Guitar Center are custom light because they were out of light, but all of the different types of Elixir acoustic strings at the appeared to have the same background color.  Also, I want to point out that I've bought the Elixir light polyweb from here recently and they were fine.  This problem might be isolated to these specific strings in light Guage.  I haven't tried any others.	-1
While I'll be the first to admit that I'm a bit biased and that I really don't care for "gimmicks" as I've seen many come and go, however after having recently tried these strings I have to honestly say - I'm just not impressed.  The only thing I can assume is that since these typically cost 2 - 3 times MORE than traditional strings, some people apparently ASSUME they must somehow be "better"...after all, if it costs more, it must be better...right?  Not always......  First and foremost, I'll address the sound...after all, that is the single greatest factor regarding a guitar string.  While longevity and playability are important factors, if a guitar string doesn't sound good, the other two issues are pretty meaningless.  I recently played these strings on both a Martin, as well as on a Seagull to provide a fair and objective comparison, To my ear, right out of the box they sound very artificial, if not acoustically dead...these just don't have the sparkle that you would expect from a more traditional acoustic guitar string.  The nearest I can figure is that the coating prevents the string from vibrating correctly...it seems to dampen the rich harmonic overtones you would normally associate with a vibrating guitar string, much the way dirt and rust do on older strings.  I suspect there are folks who prefer this to the rich, lively, vibrant sound of "fresh strings", however I don't.  As a person who plays very regularly (often as much as 2 -3 hours per day or more when I'm gigging), I do change my strings often and the sound of a fresh, traditional guitar string is just much more appealing.  Very simply, even if these strings were more realistically priced, I would not use them again based on this issue alone.  Likewise, while some folks seem to like the "feel" of these strings, I didn't.  Perhaps it's simply that I play regularly enough that my calluses are built up to the point that regular guitar strings don't bother me (it SHOULD go with the turf). Possibly its a result of my playing both electrics and acoustics on a regular basis and it could simply even be the number of years I've been playing (well over 30 as of this writing) and that I'm just very used to traditional guitar strings.  Regardless, personally I found the feel of these strings to be rather distracting...they just don't feel like "guitar strings" to my fingers.  I suspect that IF these were the only guitar strings available, given time I would eventually get used to the feel, however I simply found myself thinking more about how annoying they were than I did about my playing...not a good thing for a performing musician.  In fairness, I can't speak much to the longevity of these strings as they were removed and replaced with a set of Ernie Ball Earthwood's after only a few days (2 sets of Elixirs around $15 a pop...yea - SERIOUS waste of money there).  While it seems most unlikely, it could be possible that these somehow improve with age, perhaps as that coating wears off...but I doubt it.  Either way, I can't provide any details as to how long they might last under normal playing conditions....I just couldn't force myself to put up with them that long to find out.  As with so many things related to guitars (or music as a whole), guitar strings are of course, a very personal choice and everyone has their own tastes and preferences. In my many years as a musician, I've probably played every brand of guitar string out there at one point or another and certainly there are some brands that I do very much tend to favor (such as GHS Boomers for my electrics).  With that in mind, I can't see these Elixir strings as anything but a gimmick...between the poor sound, the annoying feel and the truly exorbitant price, seriously...I'll stick with Ernie Balls.	-1

These look cool, but they're brittle and break easily	-1
I hate to give a one-start review, instantly arousing suspicion as to the objectivity of the review, but this Capo is terrible.  It doesn't apply pressure evenly necessitating retune every time you use it.  It also doesn't have enough pressure at the open end to use on the first two frets of my Sheraton without one or two strings sounding muted..  The force of grip required to open it makes it prone to sliding out of your hand and snapping sidewise if you try to apply it quickly one handed.  It's also unnecessarily large.  I have a couple tiny planet waves dial-in capos, a couple generic ones like the Dunlop and a broken G7, all of which do a better job than this capo.	-1
Poorly made	-1
Disappointed.  It is too loud and the volume is not adjustable.  Quality is not up to par.  Sometimes, you try something and it doesn't work; no doubt it works well for others.	-1
I bought this trigger at amazon after reading only positive reviews. first tested it if the trigger works, it seems to send a signal when I hit it with good force, but the sensitivity is worthless. It doesn't trigger when I attached it to my snaredrum on the rim like it should, nothing, nada, niente. No matter how hard I hit the snaredrum.  Worthless product, better buy Roland, apart from this, you can't detache it quickly to put on another drum. You have to first unscrew it, which is not done very quick. I'm pretty new to triggering acoustic drums, don't buy the cheap ones, better spend some more and buy something decent!  I won't buy DDdrum triggers again! Period	-1
Just the facts- awkward to use considering the lever is on the bottom where the Keyser is on the top. Look at the picture- the leading edge points down which causes the capo to nosedive into the strings. Tilting it up takes a bit of finesse. It does work but I don't use a capo enough to comment on its overall durability. Not my preferred capo.	-1
These are not like the old fender thins. These pic's  wear and split to easily. they do look nice but that's the catch isn't it?	-1
I'll be short and to-the-point. In case you aren't sure, an instrument cable DOES matter. If you're looking for a reliable and sturdy cable for your bass guitar - whether for home use or on the road - then Monster Bass is the one. My last cable was a Monster cable (standard, not bass), and it lasted for five years of frequent use.  Pros: - Looks and FEELS like a high-quality cable... thick and sturdy - Great length at 21 ft. (If you don't need 21 feet, then go with the 12-foot one. But I like to move around when I play and stretch my bass across the room.) - Sleek look - This might sound ancillary, but the packaging is great! You don't have to take a saw to the package. There are tiny clips around the package to open it easily and get your cable out in a hurry! - Angled, so the cable stays a bit more out of the way while playing, and because it's angled it's not always bending, thus leading to a longer-lasting cable.  Con: - A bit pricier than your average cable, but then again this cable is sturdy. And you get what you pay for, right?  If you're in the market for a solid, functional, long-lasting, and nice-looking bass guitar cable for home use or performances that will give your bass the best possible tone quality, then go with Monster Bass. You'll be happy you spent the few extra dollars!  EDIT: 12/13/11  I went to play my bass today, but my cable did not work. I tried another cable, and that one worked fine, so I know it's the cable and not my amp or bass. I've had it for only five months, and I use it only for playing at home - not gigs - so there's no reason anything should have happened to it. It could be a freak incident for this cable, but for $40 that it no longer works is inexcusable. Thus I rescind my 5-star vote and give this cable 2 stars.	-1
Not very vintage. Lil off	-1

says it will do/fit a 12 string...... not the simon patrick 12 string made in canada...... the 12 string dwarfs the capo...... i need a large lengthy capo to play certain songs written with a capo..... always check for 12 and 6 on capo package as well as D shape neck vs other neck line figures..... will return...too pricy to have for non useable !!!	-1
...What a piece of junk ! Tried on my acoustic 12 string and I cant get clear sound. Some strings buzz, The clamping string is weak...tried on my 74 Les Paul and it's worse. All strings sound muffled and it's because the spring just isn't strong enough..I already replaced it with a Shubb which is adjustable and works great on all my guitars.	-1
No objections except this thing has a battery leak. It will use up a transistor radio battery in 6 weeks or so whether I use it or not. Maybe I have a bad unit or maybe it's a design flaw.  In any case it's not worth spending a lot of time for the price of this thing; I'll just buy another brand. But in the meantime, other buyers, beware.	-1
Music sheets slip behind it and you're always straightening  it out.	-1
Not recommended!!! This is very hard to put on! And it hurts A LOT! This is a strong capo but there is NO cushioning for the palm and fingers so imagine pushing against a hard spring through plastic/metal material without any soft support for your hand. Not recommended! I was hoping it to be easier to put on as it is my left hand and it is so hard!!! I also use it on an acoustic which has a slightly thicker neck than an electric and it is impossible for me to unclamp and remove it with my left hand without it catching some string! I have been a musician for many years and have another capo but I wanted to try a new one in hopes of it being easily movable. This is not! I have to use my right hand to unclamp for a come off. I am 5'4" and 130 lbs, female, athletic.	-1
Sound not good on yamaha apx1000. As well as the coating it immediately got stain.	-1
It has no volume control on it and it is REALLY loud and gets very annoying. I have to put it face down under a pillow sometimes when I'm practicing. After 20 minutes with this thing I think I'm going insane.  All other features are fine but I would not buy this again.	-1
I bought it for my husband who has a lot of guitars, electric and acoustic he said it does not work well and he does not use it.	-1
I bought it because it provides a click sound instead of a beep like the electronic one I have.  The click, unfortunately, is really loud.  I quieted it by placing a small, yellow stick-it over the speaker grill.  Worse, and it may be that I didn't read enough or look closely enough at the product photo, it has preset beats-per-minute (BPM) settings.  For example, under the "Allegro" setting you can choose from 120, 126, 132, 138, 144, 152, or 160.  If you want, for example, 156, you're out of luck.  For theses reasons, it sits in a drawer, unused.  On the positive side, it seems well-constructed.	-1
There are those that love coated strings and those that don't so this is just my opinion. I put a set of these on my vintage Ovation. These strings sound coated and the Martin SP's I was using sound so much better. Plus after just one week of play there's material flaking off the strings. If you want a really good sounding acoustic string that's treated to last month to 3 months that doesn't have a coated string then try Martin Lifespan's. I love Lifespan but won't be buying anymore Elixirs.	-1
had a bad string out of the box  set to tune it buzzed then snap  not happy	-1
1) It is made of plastic, not metal (should be specified in product info). The plastic is fairly rigid, so unless you are placing something quite heavy on it, it will hold without deforming. 2) The shelf is a few inches shorter than the width of the stand. *** 3) The folded part that slides over the stand lip is loose (does not grip tightly), and will slide around/off if simply placed on the stand. This means that if you bump it, or try to move the stand, it and its contents may be on the floor. I drilled holes in the stand and accessory shelf, and used small bolts to hold them together. This is an okay fix if you have or purchase the right parts, have a drill, and don't mind permanent holes in your stand. But the manufactured design should not have required this fix.	-1

The text description did not clearly differentiate electric or acoustic. If I had clicked onto the picture of the packaging and expanding the image, I would have seen it labeled for acoustic. (??)  I did not notice that it is for acoustic until I repackaged it for return. I am returning it because it makes my tuning more sharp than any capo. Typically a few strings may go sharp, but this required all strings to be adjusted once applied.  Perhaps it works better with acoustics. One feature I like it that the triggers are hidden behind the neck.  I did order the model for electrics out of curiosity and awaiting delivery.	-1
This add-on shelf is cheap plastic and poorly made. It is not very stable on the stand. It's functional I guess if you are ultra frugal. I would not recommend.	-1
I like the wire cutter, but for some reason the actual tightener squeaks a lot. I tried adjusting the screw in it, but still squeakin' like mad.	-1
This thing is junk! The problem is with the tuning peg winder. It worked fine the first time I used it (changed a full set of strings on an electric), but when I went to change the strings on an acoustic a few months later, the tuning peg winder got unscrewed and came off the handle halfway into the job. This appears to be a permanent design flaw. Screwing it back onto the handle helped only for a few minutes before it came unscrewed again while being used. Manufacturer should have used some kind of fixed pin or rivet to hold it in place...something that would allow free motion without separating from handle. As a string winder, this tool is basically useless, or at least horribly flawed and inefficient. BUYER BEWARE!	-1
where my strings go under the guide it causes the strings to oxidize.  I haven't tried stainless steel strings but I imagine they would fare better.  In addition, I recently installed a Kahler 7410 tremolo on the bass I was using this on, and it causes the strings to go sharp whenever I dive them.  I've ordered a roller tree to replace this one.  if you're not after the original Fender look, save your money, order once.	-1
The screw holding the winder kept falling out.  A little superglue and it works ok.  It should work out of the box though.	-1
Found this product flimsy..unwind few turn and suddenly the pro winder just broke..	-1
The potential here for a convenient string changing tool was great, but like many others have said, it began to squeak so badly after a few uses that I can't stand using it anymore.  I disassembled and greased it up but it didn't improve the situation.	-1
Did not hold the strings down very well for me... I love the feel of it, but the spring needs more power.	-1
I was NOT shipped Fender Shell Guitar picks as shown in the picture. Instead I was shipped regular Fender celluloid guitar picks (different shape) which is totally NOT what I wanted. Boo!  Big thumbs down.  Don't send me inferior products thinking I won't notice!	-1
This tool has been disappointingly hard to remove pins with and dangerous to my guitar. Not sure why such a positive overall review. The sizes did not fit for wither winding my acoustic or the pulling up the pins- the tool is too small to work.	-1
Hate it.. the pic is all black.. got it in metal and black.. keeps squeaking when I use it.. and it's not smooth.. don't buy it! i Warned you	-1
The stand badly scratched and dented my beautiful Taylor wood guitar along the front surfaces of the two main top to bottom bars of the stand and on the front top two corners of the top piece of the stand. To fix the stand, I purchased some 1 and 1 1/2" wide (maybe 10 feet long) neoprene rubber self adhesive strips made by Rubber Stuff Unlimited from Amazon and completely covered all metal surfaces.  It is fine now, after redesigning it and covering those abrupt surfaces and sharp corners. I recommend it but only only after you work on it for an hour or so. To repair the Taylor guitar, I pushed the dent back in as much as possible, 200 grit sanded it, and put a dab of water on each dent and scratch and waited an hour or so.  I learned this technique in college: the water helps swell the dents back up to level.  I sanded a bit more then I stained the dents and scratches with MinWax Wood Finish Stain Marker (from Ace Hardware). The stand holds the guitar conveniently.  However, it would appear whoever designed the stand did not use it on a wide range of guitars to foresee this design engineering defect.	-1
This si the only adapter that I know of that works to control the Yamaha O1v, and it was so laggy that it was mostly unusable.  Thats not to mention that the first 20 or so times I tried it I could not actually get a connection at all	-1
There are those that love coated strings and those that don't so this is just my opinion. I put a set of these on my vintage Ovation. These strings sound coated and the Martin SP's I was using sound so much better. Plus after just one week of play there's material flaking off the strings. If you want a really good sounding acoustic string that's treated to last month to 3 months that doesn't have a coated string then try Martin Lifespan's. I love Lifespan but won't be buying anymore Elixirs.	-1
This is an update to my original review because I have now fully tested two of these capos.  I'm truly surprised by all the good reviews here.  I'm not sure how it's possible.  I've already outlined below in my original review that these are not Jim Dunlop capos.  I had purchased two, which I have now given away to student players as I cannot use them.  I tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar.  The E string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring. Both capos had this very same problem.  When I received these capos, I noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual Jim Dunlop capos.  The craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official Jim Dunlop capos.  The rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand-name printed anywhere on the product.  As a professional musician, I need to purchase reputable brand-name products because I can't afford to have my gear failing during performances.  I have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand, and no measurable reputation.  When I contacted the seller, they were not honest with me.	-1
I don't know who designed the leg feature of this thing, but they need to go back to engineering school. When you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position, they're quite difficult to pop open, and once opened into place, you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off, because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand.  It'd truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place, and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar. I just don't like the features of this stand at all.	-1
The wire clipper and winder work O.K., but the pin puller is badly designed and doesn't slip under the ball of the pin in order to lift it out. Bad design by someone who doesn't use it to pull pins out of a bridge. I end up using a Jim Dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out. I've done it successfully for years.	-1
This stand does what it should--holds guitars of various sizes--but it wasn't quite what I expected. For one thing, the stand itself wobbles on the floor, slightly enough where I don't believe my guitar will fall, but enough to know it's not 100% sturdy. Also, what I couldn't discern from the photo is that the guitar leans back at quite an angle in this stand. I have another similar floor stand that holds my guitar straight upright, which is what I expected here. Due to the angle, I couldn't place the stand as close to the wall as I wanted because the headstock would crash into it. As such, this stand needs to be at least a foot, maybe a foot and a half, away from the wall to avoid headstock damage. I won't return this one but I would not buy another.	-1
Different from item pictured (the more tacky styled stick tape.) This tape is more like cloth athletic tape, don't want to put it on my sticks but I'll keep it in my gig bag for emergency finger wrap just in case.	-1
Works alright. Weird design. Functions fairly well. BUT, squeak, squeak, squeak. Man this thing is noisy. Oiled it. STILL squeaks. It is really bad. Only use the cutter. I use my 20 year old, plastic, Fender winder. It still works great. Quietly.	-1
Very flimbsy, can't get it to hold into place, and light is too dim. Honestly, it's junk.	-1
Not what I expected	-1
Did now work in my Mixdeck Q.	-1
they should say that you need also the power adapter. Now i don't know where to get one. Sad... JMG	-1
The light works fine on this, but I really am growing to hate the arm that will only support its own weight at a very few angles. I'm using it on the back of a Furman unit and it really doesn't get the job done in that position. Might work better if it were on top of a unit.	-1
I bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone I was looking for on my 7 week old guitar. Installed as usual and tuned them. They sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible. My capo could not even hold them. I set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking. When I looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. I released the tension on all the strings as fast as I could and left it. I returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. The body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now. Use at your own risk!!!!!!! I personally wouldn't give a nickel for them.	-1
Been using Elixir polyweb on my acoustic electric.. Very mellow and balanced tone. Thought I would try something different. Also the reviews were very positive on the daddario. I can't stand them. Sound very metallic and extremely noisy when fingering and moving from fret to fret. They are so noisy, the noise is more dominate than the playing or melody. The polyweb are mellow and have a softer feel. Waste of money for me. Will go back to the polyweb.	-1
Only Lasted 2yr.  I have a lot of cheaper cables that get more use/abuse than this one that have outlasted it.	-1
Bought from local Guitar Center. I usually use Martins, but tried these on a whim. For coated strings these lasted maybe 4 weeks of light playing for songwriting. My normal $3.50/pack Martins last longer and sound more balanced. These won't be on my guitars again. Not worth the price, I've contemplated on emailing them to let them know their longevity is lacking, and the tonality is pretty muddy, even for new strings, these just didn't sound good at any time.	-1
Would rather use elixirs.	-1
Very poor neck output and strident bridge pickup. How can Fender sell these? Look up reviews online about poor performing neck pickups.	-1
ordered a twelve string set and got a six string set, not happy	-1
Twice recieved dead neck pickup	-1
Personally I love D'Addario strings, but I thought I would try something new so I got these. I myself didn't like the coating, or the sounds as much as the strings I'm used to... I actually hated these and couldn't wait to get them off my guitar, but they also sounded brighter, and I like a warmer sound. Strings are trial and error, so try them out for yourself, because a lot of people love these.	-1
too low	-1
I'm Sorry ,, I tryed but just Don't like the D'Addario EXP16 NY steel. They make me not even want to play the guitar. They are dull, they vibrate, TO STIFF, the tones change from highs and lows. Its like each string is a singer and sings the note assigned. But even though the notes are right the voices don't match up. Would be OK for the right music,,, same area of play, medium loudness. These strings though just don't sound good. They need to sound good on all of the strings combined in all the ranges. (best of luck to all you searchers for the best string) It takes a lot of holding power hold as they are very stiff. Soft or loud the majority of the low note strings buzz and vibrate. Its ugly sounding. To play quiet I must use a very hard fingers hold. No room for error. Also noticed that when you try to slide up and down the strings its like sliding up and down a file. Although the Elixir Nanoweb coating slides TO much. I find the strings also sliding out from under my fingers.(on Nanoweb) (slippery) What to do  :( .//  I just ordered the D'Addario plain 80/20 Bronze, per reviews studying. Whew!!! They are saying nice strong high, high strings and good low end to make it work good. The Elixir Nanoweb custom lights .11-.52 sound great but only at low volume /  Sweet) I prefer "lights in any brand..12-.53 that way you can play HARD and get some volume out of the strings. They come alive and sing./  I started with Fender Dura tone lights, They could really sing and gave me the chills. A little stiff but I was changing over from Classic guitar. They were sweet! Had to work at getting the loud low/ high strings notes though. But loud/ crisp/  and yummy. Had to re-tune everyday for months. 4 months. Then they stopped needed tuning and began to sound bad.... time to replace. So hear I am on this quest for the best strings. Please wish me luck.	-1
This is rated low because the description said it was recommended for the Hamilton KB7700K stand, and it isn't. It will not fit with that stand. So, the tier may be great, I don't know, since I couldn't use it.	-1
Broke these about 20 minutes into playing my very first time. NOT ONLY THAT but I had massive blisters coming in where I shouldn't have had them due to the rubber gripping on to my fingers.	-1
mine broke when I set it up - the little wheel which holds the keyboard broke clean off...I'm gonna try it again as it seems like a good stand but I got a crappy one.	-1
This tool has the same aggravation as the previos version.  The wire cutter has no return-spring in the handle making the tool a PITA to use.  Open the handle... >snip< Open the handle... >snip< Open the handle...  ARRRRGH!  Seriously guys, you have a great idea, now execute it properly!  I don't know why, but the picture made it look like they added a handle spring, but NOOO, Suckered again.  Now I'm stuck with it because it'll cost too much to return.  Buyer beware, you're better off buying a cheap pair of wire cutters than this 'pro' tool.	-1
you should get this only if you have a 12 string guitar because than the winder is handy but all the wrest isn't.	-1
It serves the purpose but it's too tense, applies too much pressure to the fretboard, needs too much strength to install and it makes tuning go sharp. Every time I use it I have to pretty much retune the 6 strings, defeating the purpose of the capo itself. In order to use it live I had to bring two guitars to the stage, I usually play DGCFAD so the second guitar had the capo in the second fret to make it standard E Tuning but I had to tune it before the show to guarantee good pitch. When my main guitar snaped a string, I had to use the one with the capo, remove the capo and then retune the 6 strings for it to be in tune.  All in all, I advise you buy the Planet Waves NS dual or tri action capo.	-1
The output level of the bridge pickup was too low to even install.  I am working on a return.  Bummer.	-1
I use capos a lot and this one was one of the worst.  At first, it worked well.  It fit comfortably in my hands when moving it, etc.  Then the side caps came off repeatedly until finally they were lost and every time I went to put the capo on my guitar, it exploded!  There is one large spring in the hinge that keeps the tension there.  without the caps on the sides it just falls out.  Terrible defect.	-1

do not buy this pack if you're expecting a 3 sets of strings. what arrived was a single set (6 strings). unfortunately I was in a position where i needed them right away and had to go ahead and slap them on the guitar.	-1
Guitars: Taylor GA3-12 w/Expression system; Alvarez Baritone w/Fishman Rare Earth Blend pickup; Fishman Loudbox 100w Acoustic Amp. I have been a professional guitarist for over 30 years, and have owned a boatload of Taylors, Takamines, and now Martins.  Sorry, I tried these in lieu of my usual Elixirs, and will not use them again. They essentially died after about 2 weeks...went from "boing" to "fump". Elixirs on the other hand usually last up to six months before they start getting that dead, "fump" sound. I also picked up a set for my baritone guitar, and just for comparison mixed 2 of the bronze D'darrios with the elixirs...within a week the d'darrios were "fumped" and dead, while the Elixirs remained bright with great sustain.  I gave them one star because, until they died, they sounded great. I could not justify another star because I now have to replace them...first time in like 10 years that I have had to change strings in less than 4 months.  If I were a touring musician with money to burn, and a road tech that strung and tuned my guitars for me, they would be fine. It is true that new Elixirs are very bright in tone, while the D'Darrios have a nice warm tone at the start, but in my view, after about two weeks the Elixirs are broken in and keep a warm tone with great sustain for months after.	-1
At the recommendation of my former guitar teacher, I bought these medium gauge Elixirs for my Epiphone DR-500 MCE acoustic/electric guitar.  While they do produce more sound as an acoustic instrument (a good, pleasing sound), I apparently lack the strength to play medium gauge strings.  I did verify that the truss rod has the guitar neck straight.  After 1 week and at least 15 hours of play, I can not cut it with these strings.  Another friend, professional guitar player and luthier had recommended against the medium gauge strings but did I listen?  Going back to light weight Elixirs.  Through my amplifier, light or medium gauge strings make only a slight difference.  For whatever it's worth...	-1
this is a first time for me I ordered two packs of these string and both of the #12 strings broke at the ball when I put them on ?	-1
It was not as described in the website. I used it for one day and the strings were already corroded. Don't buy it if you are looking for a corrosion resistant set.	-1
I bought them because it said special for resonator.  Well the 6th string should be an e and it is a G.  The 1st string is a D and that's okay because I use open D tuning.  I am going to have to buy a single 6th string.  It is a 56 but for some reason is tuned to G.  I can't down tune it to a D because then the string is too loose.  So be careful when purchasing.  Amazon has others that will do the job.  The D'addario or elixir 13-56 will work in a resonator.  The quality of D'addario is not in question.  They are fantastic, bright, and long lasting.  Just not resophonic because they are made for some other use of which I am not aware.	-1
D'Addario XL and the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad strings! I've played guitar for over 20 years and have used all kinds of electric guitar strings. I thought I'd buy these "cheap" strings for practice, and use a higher end (NYXL) for gigs. Whoa, big mistake. Do yourself a favor and skip this low end product altogether. There's a reason they're cheap, and I'm thoroughly convinced now it's because they're made of the cheapest material known to mankind. After about an hour's worth of use, these things are absolutely toneless. These XL strings, after an hour of playing, sound worse than my NYXL strings that are 2 weeks old with more than 24 hours of bending, slashing, and strumming. Straight up, the XL is garbage. Period.	-1
I've played EXL110 for years and loved them, using hundreds of sets, but I think something most have changed with the production.  I've had three high E strings come unwound at the ball end in the past month.  All three were on gigs and now I'm stressed a set won't even make it through a whole show.  Come on D'Addario.	-1
Header says it all. Works well enough as a string winder, but I was really lookin for something to pull my bridge pins with and for me, this did not work well at all. Went back to my trusty rubber tipped pliers and just had to be gentle.	-1
The sound with this cable was great and I was quite happy with it for a year and a half.  After that, the cable stopped working.  I'm a bedroom player and do not even do gigs or live shows; So a pricy guitar cable that crap's out after a year and a half of very light use?  Thats unacceptable.  I should have invested in a different brand at this price range.  Other brands have better protections for where the plug and the cable meet, so that it doesn't allow for the cable to bend at that critical spot.  Monster does not have this and is therefore very prone to breakage and disconnection at that spot...  Avoid.	-1
This capo was great for the first few weeks I had it.  I then realized that the spring inside it became a lot weaker, and loose.  Now it is difficult to get it to hold down the low E string.	-1
I can't believe this shady company is still getting away with selling their COMPLETELY OVERPRICED cables.  Why are people still duped by the idea that these are ANY better than your standard Planet Waves cables, for instance.  Ask any true audiophile or serious musician, and they will tell you: these are a complete scam, marketed to suckers.  Stop buying them.	-1

Ok! Ok! Let's talk about this case a year later. First I had to rip out part of the inside to make my mandolin fit. And that was a little too easy! Next the covering starts tearing away. A scuff mark goes right thru the cheap, very thin coating and then one of the four "braces" on the bottom when the case is flat breaks off. A year later it looks like it's been through a war, and it has! The Chinese seem to be purposefully flooding our economy with cheap defective items.	-1
I tried to make this work several times. Sometimes it would, sometimes it wouldn't, so it wasn't reliable. But it always had a very loud background hum while playing, regardless. This had such great reviews, so I'm really bummed out. I thought I might have just gotten a dud, but now that I'm re-reading the lower star reviews, there are plenty of others with this same problem..	-1
Might just be a weaker capo but at first it did its job then after awhile it stopped pressing down the strings so hard so alot of the times the strings viberate on the capo and it sounds really bad id reccomend going with kyser they are alot better	-1
Did not work at all	-1
I bought this thing for my Fender acoustic which is my first and only guitar that I've played on for 6 years now. It doesn't have a pickup built into it. As I started getting involved in the worship ministry at church, I needed some way to amplify my acoustic sound. Because I'm a regular bassist, I didn't want to invest too much into a new acoustic-electric (although I would love one). And micing the guitar was nice but inefficient because I move around a lot when I lead worship. So I did some researching and came across this pickup. I took people's words for it and bought it. The pickup works. But it picks up waay too little signal. When I plug it into a DI, I literally have to put the gain up 95% of the way and then crank it up in my monitor to hear my guitar. And because the gain is so high, I get unnecessary noise.  I plugged it into my bass amp and same deal, gotta crank it up real high to actually hear my acoustic. However, aside from the noise, it sounds pretty nice with right EQing and compression. For now, I'm gonna stick to just micing it with a 57. Sounds way better.  So I don't know if mine is just a dud or if this pickup is just poorly built.	-1
I used this pickup on a Yamaha 441S and the "quacking" sounded like two ducks fighting. The highs, lows and mids all muddled together and the sound was just plain terrible.  I know it's a much cheaper pickup than my current LR Baggs M1A but my advice would be to save your money and get something nicer than the "Woody".  I gave this thing away and, after a week, the person I gave it to gave it back. Enough said.	-1
