I know these products have be reviewed numerous times, which is why I elected to try them.  But, I wanted to share the results for anyone in my situation with a yellowed vinyl window they need to save.  My friend and I buy older British Cars to put back on the road and we recently purchased a 1977 MGB Roadster that had been refurbished with a new top.  We don't know the timing of when it was installed but, the top looks great except for the vinyl windows.. The car was from Florida and somehow had been stored so, over time,  the windows yellowed badly so you couldn't see anything through them!  We knew the situation when we bought the car but, hoped we could avoid the expense if we could somehow clean the windows. After doing research online I settled on these two products to see what I could do to save the top.  The results are attached. It was a lot of work (hours of rubbing and cleaning) and I still have spots that are not completely clear but, 95% is an amazing transformation and means we do not need a top!  there are other products and solutions out there but we are very satisfied and highly recommend Meguiars #10 & #17 from our personal experience.	1
I was helping a friend out who had replaced his back, plastic windshield on his convertible previously at the tune of over $150 (many years ago).  He went around to a bunch of shops asking them if there was anything they could to do to restore clarity to the windshield.  All of them told my friend that he'd have to replace the windshield.  I told him to let me do some research on the internet and this is the product that was most highly rated.  However, I wasn't expecting much of a change, seeing how oxidized his windshield was. I couldn't have been more wrong!  Before you would be hard pressed to tell the color of the car behind you, much less what make it was.  I spent less than one hour cleaning and polishing the windshield and now you can easily identify vehicles behind you when driving.  My friend is very happy with the results and is just amazed how clear the windshield is, almost as clear as it was when he replaced it. Great product and fast shipping with Amazon Prime!	1
This product worked really well. Make sure you use microfiber, and not a drill. Also you may need several applications.	1
left a film on my stuff and did not clean the way they described. I was not using it for a boat though I was using it for a soft top for a jeep and several plastic pieces. I found an armor all Gel that works wonders. this stuff left a film.	-1
I am always impressed with Meguiar's products and this one is no exception. I am currently using these two in a consecutive process to polish out scratches in my Nav unit in my Honda and on the instrument panel.	1
Wanted separate plastic window cleaner and polish. Was not comfortable with one product to do two separate jobs. Customer comments helped me make the buy. Quick delivery and now waiting for some better weather to verify results of one small spot test; which I absolutely enjoy the results!! Can't wait to do all other windows...	1
Does what it is supposed to do.  Tough to set up the first time, but very sturdy and doesn't damage your ATV. Removal is quick, but re-installation still takes a while.	1
Easy installation, it also adds support to the suspension of the ATV	1
Fits on my Honda rancher 4x4 easy install if you have all the right tools	1
Some careful craftmanship went into this mounting assembly.  Easy to install and detach.  I had a trailer hitch ball on the back, and this unit does not allow for the ball to be mounted on the hitch at the same time.  I don't need that ball in the winter anyway.	1
good	1
very good	1
I would have gave 5 stars, but this item came with no directions, but I did figure it out on my own. And the package was torn, one of the bolts were missing. I replaced it from a nearby hardware store. We had a snow storm a few days after I received the mount I attached my plow and it worked great on my 2004 450 Kodiac.	1
Great Product Fast Delivery++++++	1
Delivered as expected easy assembly.	1
Installed on a 2005 Kawasaki prairie 360.  Pushing the 60" swisher plow or  universal dump bucket.  Also installed a Harbor Freight 3500 lb winch to raise and lower the blade/box with necessary snatchblocks to slow lift speed.  The rear ATV tires are chained.  Mounting kit:  Easy on and easy off.  Two pins and a big bolt.  I like the long bar that transfers thrust loads to the trailer hitch.  Unfortunately, It takes up about 4" of ground clearance at the front so the ATV gets high-entered a lot in rutted dirt and snow.  After the first pass with a blade all is well.  I'm exploring ways to get better ground clearance, but whatever I do the kit takes up 3-4" of ground clearance.  60" blade:  One pin holds it to the universal mount, plus the cable pulley, so it is easy to remove.  I've used it to plow deep snow and to smooth freshly moved dirt.  Since the winch doesn't apply a down-force the blade skims dirt, then suddenly digs in and stops the ATV.  Finding the 'just right' height with the winch is a challenge, and going over uneven ground adds to the challenge.  In snow the attached skids are about right and the blade does a wonderful job after the first pass.  Dump bucket:  One pin holds it to the universal mount, plus multiple cable pulleys, so it is easy to remove. The box just skims over settled dirt.  I haven't tried it on loose dirt, but on gravel roads it does a wonderful job once the bucket gets a few hundred pounds of gravel in it to weight the blade.  I use it to pile gravel in potholes, then smooth the gravel.  Lifting the bucket full of gravel causes the ATV suspension to squat and the universal mount kit drags the ground, so uneven road, roots and rock would probably stop it cold.  Dumping:  Loaded with gravel, releasing the dump lever is a bear.  it needs to be longer, and a piece of pipe slipped over the handle should do that just fine.  Or, set the bucket on the ground, release the lever and lift the bucket does about the same thing.  I need to excavate under a cabin.  The plan is to use a small trencher to drag dirt onto a sheet of plywood, then scoop the dirt up off the plywood with the dump bucket.  I installed three snatchblocks on the winch cable for the bucket  - two on the atv cargo carrier and one on the bucket plus the cable end anchored to the bucket to get enough lift to raise a loaded bucket and to slow cable speed down a lot.  It was overkill.  Two pulleys would probably be adequate.  I got the scarifier blade for the bucket but have not installed it, partly because the bottom of the bucket sits flat on the ground, so adding teeth does nothing useful. I need to see if there is a way to tilt the bucket so the teeth can dig into the soil.  I haven't looked at it very carefully with torch in hand yet.  I need to excavate under a cabin.  The plan is to use a small trencher to drag dirt onto a sheet of plywood, then scoop the dirt up off the plywood with the dump bucket.  I have a warn electromechanical lift on order for two reasons:  1.  It frees up the winch to tow the ATV when it gets high-centered, and 2. it can apply a down force for leveling dirt.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AGGX56/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1  The ATV front suspension is too soft for the dump bucket and doesn't help the push blade.  The plan is to get it to stand taller and squat less under load so I set tire pressure to the max ordered a set of heavy duty springs for the front struts.  Some suggested uplocks on the struts to eliminate squat completely.  I haven't looked into that yet.	1
so easy to install. come with all kinds of brackets. will remove easy when not needed.	1
very satisfied	1
Ordered this and had to return it.	-1
If you are going to buy a Swisher attachment chances are that you will need a mount to attach it to your equipment.  I purchased s Swisher 15714 bucket and this mount to attach it to my Kawasaki Prarie 360.  I wasn't sure exactly what I needed but was able to get a quick friendly answer form the folks at Swisher support which were very helpful.  I was able to get this mount attached quickly to my ATV and was hauling material for landscaping.  Its design is simple and the product was sturdy.  I was happy with this purchase.	1
A must have to be able to mount there Swisher Dump Bucket onto Easy to install, everything is included, plus.there are a couple of different mounting adapters included with it for different ATVS	1
gets my car clean wish it sudded a little bit better im going to try and use a little more soap see if that makes a difference.  i still have more then half after  about 6 washes	1
This product is not as good as the zip turtle wash and wax, is it not make much foam. so does any other soap foam for car, do not leave the brightness as it does the wash and wax zip.	-1
This product relies on a fancy name and bottle design to sell; it's not that great. Less expensive brands will work great if you use the right technique to wash. After 12 years of washing my car I have developed my own style that works amazingly well.  1. Get a lambs wool mit. 2. Fill one bucket with clean water and a second bucket with car wash water. 3. Wet down your car to loosen the dirt. 4. Lie your lambs wool mit on top of your car and pour a little car wash water on it. 5. Scrub down your car and then rinse the mit in the clean bucket of water. 6. Rinse the car off with the hose.  DON'T EVER PUT THE MIT IN THE SOAPY CAR WASH WATER! You will just get the water dirty and end up scrubbing your car with dirt. Your wash water will stay sudsy and foamy. This product as well as any other car wash will work just fine if you use this technique.	-1
I've used so many different car washes over the years I've lost count. In the late 90s and through 2001 I was using various high-end washes that only professional detailers usually know about. Lately I've been using P21S shampoo for my washes but I switched to Meguiar's NXT car wash this year.  Bottom line, everything that a professional detailer wants in a car wash/shampoo is in this wash! It goes on VERY smooth, REALLY cuts through dirt/grime and helps lift particles off the paint, it's reasonably gentle, it suds VERY well, it is reasonably priced, and it smells good.  Unless someone develops an even better car wash in the future, this is the car wash I'll be sticking with for LIFE.	1
I just used this product recently on a friends car. He lent me his "extra" car while my car was in the shop. It was a 2001 Mustang that usually sits about 85% of the time. I decided to wash the car and found the NXT generation Sprax Wax with my car cleaning supplies. (I purchased it approx 1.5 years ago and forgot about it)and misted while the car was almost dry. It left an incredible shine on an other wise dull paint. It made a marketable difference in literally 15 minutes. I can only imagine what the finish would look after a proper clay, polish and wax with NXT as a booster.	1
Best spray wax I have found, I had used Rally paste wax for my vehicles for many years even though it's formula had been bought and sold several times. I still like it, but this stuff is much easier to use and especially on a black vehicle it doesn't leave so much white which is difficult to buff out of crevices.	1
makes the finish stand out. easy to apply, as long as you do no apply in direct sun light. try it you'll like it .	1
This is the best stuff to use for a quick detail for home or show. can't go wrong with this with the same kind of wax. Works great for dark colors as long as you wipe well.	1
Keep the application light!!!  Apply per directions (LIGHT) and buff with micro fiber towel.  Great shine and we'll see how long it lasts.  Do not get this on black rubber or plastic parts!  Good luck getting it off if you do!	1
I have all the Meguiars line of Consumer and professional detailing products.  I have tried them all. I have to say that the Ultimate Quik wax is the best whole car detailer.  It can treat the Windshield, Windows, Rubber, Plastics and Paint. It leaves a very glossy finish.  It is my go to detailer when I am not in the mood the use multiple products to detail my cars.  The NXT spray wax on the other hand cannot be used on Glass,Plastics and rubber. It can only be applied to the paint, but the it gives a wet look the Ultimate Quick wax does not provide as well.  Let me simplify the decision process:  NXT Spray wax 1. To be used only on the paint. You will need to use separate products for the Glass and plastics. 2. It provides the best wet look of all Meguiars products. If you are obsessive in how your car looks, you will not get anything else. 3. The best in water repelling. 4. Most resistant to heat and car washes. I only wax once a month. 5. You have to make it dry to haze before you buff. 6. Has to applied in the shade.  Ultimate Quik wax 1. Best all around wax. It can be used on all the exterior surfaces. 2. It gives a very glossy finish. Not as wet look as the NXT though. 3. Lasts about 2 weeks before re-application. Other waxes from other manufacturers sometimes wash off on the first wash. 4. It provides good water protection. 5. The fastest way to wax your car, bar none. No need to wait for it to dry. Spray, spread, then wipe off. You can't get easier than that. 6. Can be applied even if the car is under the sun.  Conclusion: The NXT gives the best finish and is easy to apply so it makes up for some of the limitations as compared to the Meguiars Ultimate Quik Wax. I love them both though, that is why I use them both.	1
I didn't expect these wipes to work as well as liquid cleaners and conditioners, but at the same time I didn't expect them to leave the seats feeling a big greasy and make them leather feel harder.  I first used these wipes, but didn't see much effect. I then used a specific product that was a cleaner only, and finished with Lexol to condition it.  Made a huge improvement.  Later I used the wipes again, and was disappointed to get a greasy feeling on the seats, as well as the leather somehow feeling harder than when I started.  I'll keep them around until they're gone to wipe up spills or quick spot cleaning, but overall these wipes performed worse than my already limited expectations.	-1
This product is great for touchups on leather seats. Use between more agressive leather conditioning.	1
good	1
Works very well on my beige leather seat. Just remember to seal the can in zip-lock to avoid dry out after open the seal.	1
Easy application and great results!	1
Great shine on my leather seats. Cleans and conditions all at once. I would recommend this product to anyone trying to keep there car interior on point.	1
great product, come expect nothing less than perfection......	1
I use these on my new truck with ventilated seats. I prefer the outcome of Meguiar's Gold Class Leather Conditional creme, however it does plug the vent holes.  Several reviewers have complained that it "ruined their seats" (it didn't--the seats are coated with a plastic sealer), and that it leaves a shine like Armor All, and it will UNLESS you do as the container suggests, and buff it off with a good terry or microfiber towel. I buff immediately after carefully polishing and cleaning the seats with a wipe--immediately means no more than 30 seconds on the leather before buffing thoroughly, so each seats needs at least three cycles of cleaning and buffing to cover it. It leaves a small shine which looks the same as after using a liquid conditioner, and cleans very well, especially around the seams. I suppose Lexol is in some ways a better product, but for a weekly quick clean these cannot be beat for convenience and effectiveness.	1
WORK LIKE MAGIC...NEED NOT SAY MORE.....	1
cleans and protects leather well	1
So far I'm impressed with the product. It cleans very well and the shine remains for days. Will purchase again.	1
good concept but I find that after you wipe a seat with it the product does not soak into the leather all the way and the seat has the product film on it that winds up getting wiped off on your clothes.  I did try to towel the seat down afterwards but the product still seemed to be there on the seat.  I was thinking it would clean condition and then evaporate and be dry to the touch but it didn't.  I might be concerned where and when I use it if the person using the car or truck is wearing something nice.	-1
This is the perfect wipe. Not too much; not too little. Each wipe is enough for about one car seat. I use them whenever there's a spill or whenever I have a spare minute to give my car a little TLC. Two notes: after reading a bunch of reviews I decided to keep the dispenser locked up in a Ziploc freezer bag. So far every wipe is fresh. Also, if you get streaking the LAST thing I would do is try to remove the streaks. My guess is your leather is drying out and some sections are absorbing more than others. Leather doesn't dry evenly. It's animal hide, not a chemical product. I would either repeat or better yet go get a bottle of conditioner and wipe on till streaks disappear. My $0.02!	1
These work just OK on my car with black leather seats, but they dry out quickly when stored.  I used about 10 of them, but wasted product and money when I had to toss the rest out because they dried up!  When will Meguiar's INDIVIDUALLY WRAP these?!	-1
very good	1
I have spent HOURS trying 4 different products to get this ABSOLUTE GARBAGE off my brand new SUV's leather seats!!!  They were getting a bit of dirt on them from jeans, normal wear, so I decided to use this product to clean them.  HUGE MISTAKE!  It literally took my gorgeous peanut butter tan leather and turned it into a shiny, vinyl-looking muddy brown!  My seats SQUEAKED when you sat in them.  Even my mother, who never notices anything about my car, said "what is on your seats?!".  I finally got most of it off with Lexor Leather Cleaner and lots of elbow grease, but you can still see bits of shine in the deeper crevices of my leather door panels.  I threw out every Meguiar's product and will never purchase from this company again!  Do yourself a favor and use a quality product like Lexol!	-1
Removed the soil and made everything look nicely conditioned.	1
Due to a spill of coffee in my brand new Subaru, I purchased this product because of my experience with all the other Meguiar's products over the past 3 years.  I have purchased everything from the care care kits to other interior and exterior products as well as towels from them.  Unfortunately, this product turned my grey leather seat a greasy, shiny black. Even after wiping with a towel, the stain remained. I ended up having to use Lexol leather cleaner 3 times to get rid of the greasy black shiny residue from my seat and there are still remnants of it.  However, the seat is now grey once again. Hopefullly one more pass of Lexol will get rid of the rest.  In short, a huge disappointment and I will no longer purchase Meguiar's products.  I had trusted them because of my other experiences, and I am only glad it was my passenger seat and not my driver's seat, so I didn't ruin my suits.  Again, one product has made me refuse to ever buy anything by Meguiar's again.  So use at your own risk.	-1
They dry out pretty fast in the bottle	1
Pretty simple review. The wipes work. We use these on our leather couches in our house.	1
I really like these for cleaning they do a great job. Only problem is if you don't use them for awhile the top one or two sheets dry out within a couple weeks	1
when I bought my first car at the age of 16 (20 years ago) , the guy down the street saw me washing my Lumina z34.  The next day he gave me a "gift basket" with some Meguiar's products as a way to congratulate me on my first car.  Ever since then, I've always used Meguiar's products and I too now continue the tradition of sharing Meguiar's with neighbors, family and friends..  Gosh.. i sound like an info-mercial!  I use these from time to time to freshen up my seats (Mazda CX5 2016 GT) and I like having them in the event of an emergency, aka someone makes a mess in the car.  I even bought one for my mom who just recently purchased a new Fiat 500x!  To do both front seats (front and back) and rear seats, also the various levels of leather trim that I have (steering wheel, door panels, auto stick), I use about 4 wipes per use.  I plan on moving to the liquid form because I feel I can get more use out of it, while for my mother.  This is really easy for her to spot clean her seats and I know she won't invest into cleaning as much as I do (i go it 3 - 4 times a month while she will do it 3-4 times a year)	1
Easy to use, no unpleasant odor.  Cleans and conditions in one application.  Not greasy.	1
Great for touch ups and medium cleanings!	1
These wipes are perfect for those areas that are touched on a regular basis. Keep the leather looking new with one easy swipe. Will buy again and again.	1
ok	1
I use many Meguiar's car care products and have done so for many years primarily on Jaguars which I have driven for 15+ years. I got tired of the liquid and spray leather care products because of their messiness and sometimes stickiness. These wipes are perfect for a quick, easy wipe of any smooth leather product. They don't leave a sticky feeling, do not need a wipe down and the leather looks great. Like all wipes they can dry out in the container if not used in a reasonable amount of time. I occasionally turn the container over for a while to keep the wipes fully moist.  These are best used with leather in good condition. Not really intended for very dirty or damaged leather. I hope this review is helpful!	1
great product and great service	1
Seems like a gentle leather cleaner. Didn't leave any unacceptable smells. Left a bit of a sheen, but was easily resolved by wiping with a microfiber cloth (didn't look bad, just prefer a more matte look).	1
like	1
No discoloring of my black leather interior.  Some other product in the past left a white dry look that I can't seem to get rid of.	1
not bad,, but many big greasy	1
It's very good quality..	1
A lot of reviews complained about how greasy it leaves the seat but I didn't have that problem. I would go as far as to say that they could be a little bit more moist.	1
These seem great for the leather and my dash, but if you put it on your seat, you will slide all around until it goes away. Also, I keep these in my jeep in the door, and over the summer, they dry up from the hot sun...but that's my problem.	1
Fast WIPE your LEATHER seat with these hyper PRACTICAL wipes. Doesn't leave residues after letting it soak for about an hour --- SOFT to apply. Its a WINNER.	1
Works good.	1
Good product	1

Makes the leather look super rich and moist  -  great buy. Meguire products are excellent.	1
I decided to start using Meguiar's products on my car in lieu of Armor All due to some long term concerns with Armor All; I've been very satisfied!	1
Best my interior has looked, ever!	1
Fixed years of sun damage	1
Got the wrong project. Did not get leather cleaner but protectant type wipes similar to Amour All. I would never put this on leather	-1
This product is Great makes my leather shine	1
Better than the rest.	1
Great wipes. I use them after the gym and every other week to keep my leather clean and moisturized. Great price too	1
It is an okay product, the wipes are barely enough for one seat if that.  Wish I would have bought a spray on product...	-1
This garbage ruined the leather in my 11' Impala. I followed the directions and used it on the front and rear leather. It turned my soft leather hard and also left white residue that looks like suntan lotion all over the leather. Anywhere my hands touched left residue on the plastic trim. Also got some on the trunk spoiler and it left permanent finger prints in the paint. This stuff is complete crap and because of this I will never touch leather with anything but warm water on a cloth. Kiss off Maguires! I ended up replacing the front and rear leather seats in my car because it annoyed me so much. GARBAGE!!!	-1
Ive been using this product for many many years I have a 03 vw gti golf with black leather seats The product goes on smooth and even Gives a wet look when dry Not sticky when dry  give about hour or 2 to dry depending on where you live	1
Best leather wipes I have used, looks good, easy to use, non greasy, makes leather or vinyl look new again, on auto seats or recliners or couches. Highly recomended.	1
I looked all over the Internet, and found the best price here on Amazon.  I even checked local stores:  The lowest price I found was 29.99 per stabilizer stand. I feel as though this company lost money on me, using Amazon Prime to ship this heavy item from the East coast to me in 2 days.  This was an open box, so I was able to get it for a little less than I thought I would have to pay.  The item arrived in near perfect condition with only a couple of scratches -- in places that would probably be scratched from normal use anyways.  I was very skeptical to buy an open box item, but felt Amazon would take care of me if for any reason I wasn't satisfied.  It also came with detailed directions which included the suggestion of what bolts to buy. This made installation on my tent trailer a breeze.  My tent trailer is now complete with 2 existing jacks on the back, and these 2 new ones on the front.	1
These are what came on my camper and should last for a good few years.  They install easily and work great.	1
Compact and convenient stabilizers. I'm using these on a 20ft cargo trailer. The trailer has drop axels so finding a place to mount these so they don't reduce ground clearance is a bit of a challenge.  Select a place between frame members and use a mounting plate welded between the frame members.  Product as delivered is two stabilizers and a ratcheting bar.  Durability can only be assessed after some extended use some months from now.	1
This is the second pair I have added to a travel trailer.  They are very easy to install and use.	1
The Jacks Work Great	1
Works great for added stability on small campers.  Not high capacity though	1
Works great. Holds the trailer steady when i ride my bike in unattached to the tow vehicle	1
These work great and were easy to install.	1
Works great.  No problems so far.	1
Definitely a good thing to add to your cargo trailer. They should really come with these already installed. As a newbie we made the mistake of trying to unload our ATV/UTV without being attached to a truck. Luckily we just teter tottered a little before noticing what was happening.  Placed blocks under tail.  This is a pain. nice to just flip the legs down and rock on!	1
This is a real review, I paid full price for this item  used these for a cargo trailer, they worked perfectly and are very sturdy. install took a while, luckily my trailer had a piece of steel frame welded on each side for supports (but did not come with them). I bought a Milwaukee step bit from HD and had these installed in no time. Used stainless bolts, washers but instead of lock nuts used self locking nuts. these are very easy to put away and easy to use. I haven't had to use the bar yet, a better way to deploy them is to lower the front using the jack, drop both supports, then jack up the front again until there is some load on them. don't jack it up too much, since you're supposed to leave most of the weight on the tires	1
These are identical to the original equipment on my 30 year old UHaul camper. They are simple, easy to use and they work well. I only wish they were plated, as they do scrape off the paint where they slide, but that is an aesthetic issue, not functional	1
These jacks sure make it easier to load and unload a car from my trailer.  No more stacking wood or other things to support the back of the trailer.  To mount them to the side of the trailer (there wasn't room on the underside) I used a short section of heavy angle iron.  Very simple and works great.	1
Had a bad jack on my camper, took about 10 minutes to replace it. Only needed one, but for this price I have another spare, plus I have the push rod! never even knew that existed or what those holes were for!	1
Perfect for the cargo trailer!	1
The four pairs of 650lb stabilizers that I paid a premium for arrived as the cheaper 1000lb stabilizers. Make sure that you allow enough time to recieive the cheaper ones, ship them back, and receive the more expensive 650lb jack that you actually paid for. I did order one set of the 1000lb jacks. They arrived as promised. The jack work well but don't expect to receive what you paid for.	-1
as advertised,quality product	1
Seem to work well. Cons.....a little short	1
super, j	1
A snap to install and they work like a charm!	1
Great price for a must have accessory on a trailer. Fantastic quality, easily adjustable height, foldable, durable.  Install instructions lacking in detail but pretty simple. I wanted to install them into the metal frame to ensure they were in a solid support so I went to home depot and bought 2x bolts, spaces and lock-nuts for the depth of my frame plus a little extra (think it was 6-inch bolts with 3/8-inch). However, to install them to the frame and have them foldable/completely hidden I installed them sideways (east/west instead of typical north/south direction) and they still provide fantastic support for the trailer.  Supported 2+ adults and 100+ pounds of goods being moved in and out of the trailer no problems. Highly recommend and quick install if you have a drill, you a stepped drill bit or increasing sizes if drilling into metal, and bolts etc.	1
Work great on my little trailer. Once they are set they don't move and keep the trailer stable. Make sure you have the jack rod all the way in to the back hole or you will bend the front of the stabilizer leg!	1
Very easy to install, and easy to deploy using your foot mostly.  These feet allowed me to drive my 4x4 in to the trailer without tipping.	1
Received these right on time and product as expected worked great on my ATV trailer so I could unload and load with out being hooked to the tow vehical	1
Not bad sandpaper alot of shops use it.	1

These are no nonsense 320 grit red pads. The velcro works great. They do not clog easily, though bondo always clogs eventually. The paper is fairly thin, as expected. It is not nearly as delicate as it seems. Held up very well.  Rec without hesitation	1

4 stars because it's cheap for a 3m product.  Won't last as long as purple clean sheet paper or gold 3m paper but worth it for the price.	1
THE BEST	1
This is a great, professional quality gauge. The glycerin inside seems to cushion all the parts making for a more durable and more accurate gauge you can keep in your car in just about any temperature condition. Sometimes air builds up in the gauge, and you will notice that the pressure will not read as zero when you get it. This is simply fixed by momentarily unplugging the rubber plug on the back of the gauge. It would be nice if the gauge actually held the pressure after a reading is taken, but it does not.	1
I've been through several cheaper dial type pressure gauges, and I bought two of these, one was a gift to my son.  We each have cars as well as several motorcycles, and I wanted a well made, robust, easy to read  and preferably US made unit.  This fit the bill entirely, and this is what I would classify as a "lifetime" tool.  It's amazing how inaccurate those cheaper guages were after comparison to this.  The only complaint I have (a very minor complaint) is that the chuck does not swivel easily, and if the tire valve is a little hard to reach, this presents a minor challenge in getting a proper reading.  However, do not let that dissuade you from getting this gauge!	1
This gauge does not have the check valve, so bleeds off immediately when you take it off the stem.  I knew that when I purchased it and having used it for a while now, I'm ok with that.  It is well dampened, so the needle doesn't slam against the pin when you release pressure.  The bleeder works well for adjusting pressure down from the high side.  I have yet to figure out how to equalize the pressure as mentioned in the paperwork.  Otherwise, it is a good quality gauge and I expect it will last a long time.	1
I've owned dozens of tire pressure gauges over the years of varying levels of quality, but all low cost or freebies.  I finally pulled the trigger on this one and am very pleased with my decision. I was considering this and the Motion Pro Professional gauge. I  liked the Motion Pro features and looks better but, since they moved production to Taiwan I went with the US made Intercomp and saved $25 in the process.  Aside from the aesthetics the only feature the Motion Pro has over this Intercomp is that the hose swivels at both ends. You immediately realize why this is beneficial the first time you use this gauge. Not enough to be a problem but it would be perfect if the hose swiveled at both ends.  The gauge face is large and easy to read.  Filled with glycerin the instructions say to open the cap and vent it the first time you use it.  Be careful when you do this, I used a thin flat head screwdriver to pop off the cap and it promptly flew to the back of my bench so I had to spend several minutes searching for it.  You have to remove the blue rubber casing to access the cap which is a pain but not a big deal.  The sweep of the needle is slower than I expected when I check pressures.  The effect of the liquid damping. This means you have to hold the chuck on the valve a bit longer than you would for a non-liquid filled.  Again not an issue just something that I hadn't experienced with non-liquid filled gauges.  Intercomp is a well respected and innovative company in the motorsports industry and this is a quality product.  I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a professional grade tire pressure gauge.	1
We purchased this for our motorcycles, where the difference of a few pounds of air could mean as much as a 30-percent difference in tire life as well as dramatic differences in how the bike handles.  Intercomp is a well known and highly regarded name when it comes to tire pressure, and this gauge lives up to that standard.  The quality is outstanding and the accuracy is within less than half a pound of gauges costing five times as much, which adds tremendous peace of mind that my tire pressure is set correctly.  The bleed of valve is great and allows you to accurately set pressure very quickly.  What I really like about this gauge, however, is that many liquid filled gauges cannot be stored on their side once they are initialized.  But the Intercomp has no such limitation, making it a lot easier to take this gauge with you.	1
Is good, I use in my water pump system. Pressure valve is set at 40 psi and to have better resolution I use this 0-60 Psi gauge.	1
excellent quality. I have a Harley bagger and it is hard to reach in and get a good reading on those wheels. This head is almost 90 degrees, works well, seems very accurate.	1
This is my second Intercomp gauge - I had initially ordered the 4" model, but unless you're part of an NHRA pit crew, the 2.5" size is more than enough. It fits better in the hand, and having an accurate readout down to 5psi is a requirement for some oversand and off-highway vehicle areas - even if you'll never get that low with non-beadlocks. Yes, it's $50 for a tire gauge, but even after a few uses I get the feeling this will outlast the truck it's in.	1
very very very accurate nice product thanks	1
I love the fact this gauge is built in the USA as I prefer to support American jobs.  Build quality is excellent, and accuracy appears to be spot on.  The one item I don't like, as compared to my Joe's Racing Tire Air Pressure Gauge, is the hose swivel is at the gauge itself, not where you connect to the valve stem.  For me, I found this to be far less easy to work with.  I have a youtube video under redonkilaus if you want to see a short compare and contrast of this gauge verses the Joe's Racing version.	1
I bought this to replace one purchased long ago. It works great. Dont have to worry about the ends staying in the heads. Especially on the DOHC engines where they are recessed. Came with ends for a Motorcycle or Small engine.	1
i like,good quality	1
This tool is required for the school that I attend and they work perfectly. I am very happy with this order.	1
The unit comes packaged in a good compact case, has plenty of fitting sizes, and I've used it so far twice on my old 73 Cub tractor, and it worked great with that. The snap fittings are easy enough to use even with a half-lame hand, and the cables, threaded adapters and O-rings all seem to be of decent quality. I'd say a decent buy for the price. I don't know how well this would last under heavy use, but I can't see any reason it wouldn't.	1
I love MityVac products, and this little compression kit has a great selection of adapters to make it usable in almost every situation.  Need a good kit?  Buy this one!	1
Okay, I will give just the technical specs of this gauge from a specific, logical and smart evaluation. Let's start. WOW!!! That may be a little too brief. Mannnnn, Wow!	1
accurate and easy to use.	1
This gauge is great. It is very easy to read and the glow in the dark feature worked very well the other night when I went outside to check my trailer tire pressures.  This is a very nice quality gauge. One issue with it is as others have mentioned. In the picture it says Made in the U.S.A. the one I received says nothing so I have to guess it is no longer Made in the U.S.A. which is too bad really. Other than that I have no problems with it.	1
Easy to use. Large easy to read gauge and air pressure scale markings. I like the fact that you can overinflate your tire slightly, place the pressure gauge fitting on the valve stem, and without removing the gauge, bleed off air until you reach desired pressure. Perfect tire pressure every time.	1
great	1
Goes on very easily with fingers. Body heat softens the product and makes it very easy to apply.  Soaks in well and really seems to protect so far.	1
love this stuff!	1
Works amazing on my danner hiking boots. It does darken the leather slightly, but this does not matter to me on my hiking boots. Conditions, and protects my boots!	1
Not recommended for shoes with brogueing (honestly, not sure how to spell that....read: "fancy design") as the wax fills the holes and leaves them wax colored.  For all of my other leather conditioning (I've used it on belts and endless other things) it's really tremendous.	1
So heres the deal: I don't write a lot of negative reviews. I don't need to. If you make a purchase having done your homework you probably won't have to. I research before I buy. I read information on line and I read a bunch of reviews here. Thats also why I write them. I get a lot of good information from reviews and I want to help if I can as well. So I rarely get any nasty surprises or major disappointment. Thats the case here as well. The reviews are correct. This is really good stuff. I first tried it out on a pair of old Chippewa Engineer boots I have had for years. Now they were already a dark brown so I couldn't tell if the color was affected. But the conditioning was beautiful and the water repellent aspect is excellent. So I wanted to give it a try on this pair of Sperry drivers mocs I bought this winter. They weren't cheap and I really love the color, so I was nervous about it changing. No worries. Just barely made them a very little bit darker. Not enough to bother me. Hopefully the conditioning and waterproofing works out as well. If so Ill up it the fifth star. Sorry for being so long winded. Highly recommend. Thanks for reading	1
The best for leather !	1
Best leather preservative of my life. Even helps my dry finger tips in winter. Better than Snow Seal Smells great	1
Works great	1
This stuff is trippy - it smells a bit like honey due to the bees wax. I really like the results though - my boots look great!	1
true to its words. works like magic n quickly absorb to my Red Wing 877 easily. totally better than my previous Red Wing Mink Oil.	1
Ive used this now for about a month or so, treating sheathes, whips and holsters.  This is the first leather conditioner/protectant that goes on very easy and lasts.  Other similar products don't seem to keep the oiled/waxed look for long.  This stuff is magic for leather	1
has odor if you are a hunter.	1
Keeps my boots and my GF's boots in nice shape. Great product and surprisingly smells lovely. Great to keep boots from dying in our salty sloppy MN winters.	1
Made my 25 year old Sorrel books as waterproof as new	1
This stuff really works good. makes boots look new and does not have a bad smell. Also helps soften leather for faster break in of the boots. Not sure about a water repellent cuz i stay out of the water. I hate wet feet. Use a lot on first time application.	1
Good product, easy to apply and brought the life back to my boots.	1
look no further. this is it. I've tried several brands of leather cleaners/conditioners and they aren't half the man this stuff is.  I heated up the product with a hair dryer as recommended and I also heated my boots a little.  If I could have given it 10 stars I would have	1
Great product. Easy to apply. Helps with softness and waterproofing. Really helped break in new boots. Theyre  steel toe and so well see if theres any disadvantage to soft leather over the toe.	1
The Heavy Duty LP is the best leather care product Ive ever experienced. I love how easy it is to apply, and the protection it provides. It does darken the leather, but the outcome is a soft, supple, rich, and healthy leather surface. Ive used on boots, belt, holster, and wallet.	1
Works great. The 8oz comes with more than plenty to grease at least 5 different pairs of boots.	1
Just applied Obenaufs to a pair of work boots so cant comment on its performance yet but based on prior reviews, Im sure this stuff will perform well. Purpose of the review is to add some light to the way the oil changes the color of the leather. I knew that products like this darken leather and am very pleased with the results. But thought it would be helpful for others to see the actual results after application. Pics included. The darker boot has the oil applied. Id say it dramatically changes lighter color leather so may be worth considering if this is acceptable to you before using a product like this.  Overall easy to apply and I trust other reviews are accurate and the leather will be well protected in the harsh New England climate.	1
Keeps you boots looking like new.	1
I am sure it is a good product. But bought it with a pair of boots that where terrible. Haven't used yet	-1
This stuff is great.  Will darken the leather as stated in other reviews, but smells great and seems to condition just as well.	1
Simply awesome!  Works great and has kept my boots looking great and truely waterproof.  I use this on all my western, hunting, and work boots	1
I live on the Washington/Idaho border and was pleasantly surprised to see this stuff was made over in Peck.  I bought this for my Georgia work boots that only see business office use and occasional job site use.  Not heavy duty use at all.  The boots were brand new and scuffed easily.  Applied the LP and it did darken the leather a bit, but it removed the scuff marks.  Occasionally I will get a scuff mark and a quick touch up will make the boots look perfect again.  I preheated my oven to 200 degrees, placed the boots in there for about 10 minutes, then took them out and applied the LP.  The leather just sucked this stuff up like a sponge.  Then put the boots back in the oven for a few minutes to "cure" it a little.  Used it last night on my daughter's Bear Paw snow boots which she complained weren't waterproof.  They are mostly black sued with a thin smooth leather strip around the top of the sole.  I only applied the LP to the smooth leather.  I touched the suede in a couple of spots and it was not a good thing.  Do not try to use this on suede!  I have worn my work boots in heavy snow and there was no moisture seeping in.  They are not advertised as being waterproof and the LP worked to make them so.  One final note is the smell of this stuff.  It smells like honey and is wonderful.  But that worried me a bit.  Would my dog now be tempted to chew my boots?  Not yet.  But do I really want this stuff on hiking and hunting boots in the woods where there are bears?  I guess I'll find out.	1
This is an amazing product. I use it weekly to keep my Wescos in top condition.	1
I use this in all my boots, motorcycle, cowboy and hiking. Keeps the leather soft and prevents it from drying out.	1
No complaints. Shipped quickly and packaged well. I use this on my dress belts and leather boots. Will buy again!	1
Absolutely the best treatment for leather boots. A must have for keeping boots alive	1
This is a very good product for softening and shining leather.  The only thing that bothers me a little is having to apply it with your hands.  At least they tell you this on the outside label.  I haven't tried a rag on the leather because it works well using my hands.  It is easy to clean your hands after use.  I would recommend this to a friend..	1
Application is kind of tedious. I warmed a little bit of the wax in the microwave. After it melted I smeared it all over the boot. It will solidify in this process which doesn't look good but that's expected. I then worked it into the boot using a brush until everything was nice and even. I then left it in the sun to better melt in. I repeated this procedure 2 more times to get a nice coating. Currently, when water gets splashed onto it, it beads up. It also made cleaning dirt off of them pretty easy, wet rag and it was like new. Time will only tell if it helps the leather last.  I do have to warn you that it will darken the leather and change the appearance. In the attached picture, the treated boot is on the left. It has since lightened somewhat from this initial picture.	1
works great this is some awesome product	1
works well	1
Best	1
This stuff is really great for leather conditioning.  I previously used the Kiwi Mink Oil which works well but has silicone which sometimes turns white.  The Obenauf's LP really penetrates into the leather and you can tell this will keep the leather moisturized for quite a while.  The application is very easy and it seems to melt when rubbed and it has a spicy smell after application.  Overall very good product.  The price is a bit more than the other product but it seems it will last a while.	1
Best thing ever for leather boots!	1
Good stuff!  Works as advertised! Will purchase again.	1
This product is great.  I used it on my recently saddle soaped boots (4 or 5 pairs) and loved the way that they turned out.  It will darken your leather, but the protection is a fantastic trade-off.  I applied it with my fingers, and it has the consistency of almost candle wax.  Your body heat actually activates it and makes it spreadable.  It instantly heals the scratches on your leather, and looks greasy/oily at first when applied.  Once it soaks in, it has a duller, matte appearance, which can be buffed into more of a shine.  It's a great way to protect the investment you've made in your footwear.	1
Glad I tried this, the day after I applied it to my boots, I was out in the rain for hours, standing in water, nothing penetrated, days later I had some product splatter on the boots, it shrugged it off. It does not POLISH but it is a superior protectant	1
Great product and have recommended this to many friends.	1
The best way I've found to soften and preserve leather. Nothing else even comes close.	1
Excellent conditioner	1
No problems so far.  Boots suck it up.  I was expecting it to darken leather, so that was not a  problem for me.  Applied on two pairs of Justin boots; one pair old one pair new.	1
Obenaufs is AWESOME leather preservative!  Definitely recommend it!  Been using this since it was first brought to market.  Wonderful bees wax smell!	1
Love this stuff. Really nice results on leather sheaths and such	1
Seems to be doing it's job. Abused leather is starting to soften up.	1
bro , this shiz work , really better quility than expected and has lasted even through my job outdoors working with fertilizer and weed control	1
Great product	1
Perfect for all leather made items.  Boots, knife sheath, or gun holsters.	1
great, way better than snow seal	1
There's a reason this stuff gets good reviews. I've started purchasing less and getting better quality when it comes to what I wear and I purchased Obenauf's after a lot of research to put on my new Red Wings. Oddly I find it very relaxing to condition my boots and this product is very nice to work in with just your hands. A couple coats and the water beads up on the leather. It smells good, it's made in the US and there's no harsh chemicals. Great product in my opinion.	1
Good stuff!	1
I cleaned up my old work boots with Saddle Soap and protected them with this. It applies well, and is easy to do. The preservative sinks into the leather and seems to work well. I'll continue to use and expect my boots to last for years to come.	1
Magic, make my boots go from looking like sh*tkickers to looking presentable	1
I drive a concrete mixerall day I have concrete splashing on my pants and boots...had I not used this product,my 180$ boots might last 2-3 months...now they last a good year at least...usually 1 1/2 yr.	1
really great product	1
I use this on my leather boots that are designated for the nasty chores. Makes them easy to clean and keeps them very dry. Couldn't be happier with this stuff.	1
Have used many diffrent products and this stuff is the best one I have used yet. Definitely will be an item purchased again.	1
Accept no substitutes! Will make your vinyl car interior smell like a Mercedes! Your shoes, boots, belts, etc. will love it too!!	1
This stuff is amazing. It helps with scratches on leather and conditions it really well. Amazing how soft it leaves the leather feeling.	1
Great, seeps into coated leather Danner Rain-Forests, love it.  Decent smell.  Does not linger on the leather like greasy ones.  Little goes a long ways.	1
This is my go-to leather protectant. I used it to protect and breathe new life into everything from watch bands to boots.	1
Easy to apply and water rolls off on rainy day.  Have not had a chance to test it in a soaking storm yet.  I applied with a soft rag while wearing rubber kitchen gloves instead of with my bare hands.	1
Love this product	1
Awesome stuff. (Bought it at Cabelas for $16.99)	1
Bought my first pair of Red Wing Boots - (8883s) and first time using Obenauf's. Both are great, and even better together. Buy it.	1
I like mink oil better for shoes	-1
Smells funny, but so far works Fine	1
Amazing.  This stuff really works.  It restores, preserves, and protects leather items.  I brought a pair of Vasque Sundowner Italian leather hiking boots back to life with Obenauf's HD LP.  Very few products actually live up to their hype.  This one does.	1
If you care about your leather boots and want to maintain them, this stuff is a must.  Clean your boots with a stiff bristle brush, wipe them clean with a damp rag, and apply this wax by hand so your body heat gets it to melt.  Let them dry overnight and wipe off the excess in the morning. I swear by this stuff!  Thanks Obenauf's!	1
This stuff is great. I use it and the liquid on everything, even cheap $15.00 WalMart loafers (that now last 5 times longer). More effective and lasts much longer than the off the shelf silicone and other Colem**n and Kiw* stuff.	1
Great Stuff! It absolutely melts into your leather goods. I bought a new pair of nice new Timberland boots for everyday wearing but with snow, salt and lots of Seattle rain and wanted to ensure my boots would be long lasting. Best stuff I have used. I came home from work and with my new boots went out and plowed my driveway of snow. After an hour, the boots were dry and soft, and looked just as great as before. It also applies very nicely and quickly. While I did take an hour or two on the first couple of coats to make sure they were well coated, its easy to do a quick touch up before heading out and best of all your hands are left feeling smooth and great!	1
Good product.  Light smell. I would buy again	1
I found out the hard way decades ago that using any sort of oils from animals for boots is just a smorgasbord for mold that destroys boots.  Have been a snoseal man for years.  Putting boots in an oven is handy, but stupid unless you can keep the temps under 110...which is a reasonable high temp that a boot might see.  There are lots of glues in the new boots that are gonna degrade in that heat.  Snoseal had a higher melting point than Obenauf's...which is why the hair dryer is necessary.  I got some new Danner work boots.  They soaked up 4 coats of Obenauf's.  And because Obenauf's melts in your hand, it's also gonna melt into the boot every time you wear them.  There was a very noticible change is the pliability of the leather.  I also put a coat on a pair of 3 year old Limmer mid weight hiking boots with 500+ GPS miles on them...only one coat...but these had been snolealed (these are old school boots...no gore Tex booties)	1
I've been a Snow Seal user for many years, but decided to give Obenaufs LP a try, and boy am I glad I did! The product goes on silky smooth and enriches the leather right before your very eyes! I used a blow dryer to warm the leather and also used it to liquefy the Obenaufs LP. Using a rag, I applied it to a variety of leather products from holsters to sheaths, in a variety of colors. While the Obenaufs did slightly darken the leathers, the difference was minimal, and in fact, very pleasing. I used it on both smooth and rough leather (meaning the inside of belt loops on my sheaths) and it applied easily and evenly. After the application, I gave the leather a quick buff with a clean rag and done!  My only regret with the purchase I made was that I did not buy the large size right away.	1
This stuff spreads and works great. Applied to my boots and worked the next day in the rain and my feet were dry! I wear lace up boots. Will definitely buy this again.	1
I work in structural concrete and before thus stuff would have to replace boots every six months. After using this I get over a year out of my boots. Concrete eats leather but this restores them.	1
Works great, waters proofs very well.  It made my boots very dark in color.  The color change does not matter to me and I highly recommend this product. It definitely makes leather boots softer and provides excellent protection from moisture.	1
works well to help make boots more water resistant!	1
Is good	1
Works great! Does it's job, It will darken the color of the leather a bit.  Apply a bit of heat after rubbing it into the leather and it will get absorbed faster and last longer.	1
Awesome product	1
I really enjoy this product. When I get a new set of boots I use Obenauf's leather oil first to soften up the leather then I use this to seal up the leather. I really focus on the seams and the stitching on the sole. My boots are used quite a bit around chemicals and overall harsh environments and this product along with other Obenauf's products absolutely make my boots last longer. Also cleaning the boots regularly and reapplying oil and lp is critical.	1
best leather protection you can get! i use this on all leather products. conditions and water proofs works great and goes a long way.	1
Does it's job, It will change the color of your boots.	1
This stuff works great but when your done and it is dry it feels a little rubbery. I think it works great for keeping the leather up.	1
easy on and the boots look great... this darkened my boots beautifully! i love it	1
Amazing stuff. Always put it on after a good saddle soap and my boots look new.	1
This is my goto oil in taking care of my leather products. Does a great job of revitalizing leather and water proofing	1
Kind of pricey but a great product for leather goods.	1
First off. All of you guys that used this product on your fancy leather boots or jackets, and complained that it discolored your boots/jacket... Obviously any wax/petroleum based conditioner is going to do that. This stuff was designed by a fire fighter to protect their turnout gear. It's not for all you fancy people. I've used it on a 10 year old tool belt. I've used it on work boots. This is not meant to be cosmetic product for your boots or jackets. And for the people who complained about waterproofing... One thing coat of ANY product is not going to waterproof your boots. I don't hike, so I don't know how it works on hiking boots, but I can tell you that several coats of this stuff, applied with a hair drier or heat gun, will most of definitely waterproof your boots. Just don't put the heat gun directly on the boot or sole, because besides altering the composition of the leather permanently, you will melt any adhesives. Yes. It waterproofs. Better than SnoSeal. Yes, it will darken your leather after it is applied. Yes it will condition your leather. I generally apply 3 to 4 coats of this on my redwing boots every year right before winter. I haven't purchased a new pair of boots in many years. You get what you pay for. So if you buy a higher end pair of boots or even in my case a tool belt. Know how to properly care and maintain it to extend its service life. Boots are a protective tool. Not a fashion accessory.	1
Really good protection from the environment, but the boots i bought are a dark brown. So i tested the product on the backside of the boot first to see how it would react. It turned the leather black, so i decided not to apply on the whole boot. I'm going to save it for my leather belts and such.	1
Best leather conditioner out there!	1
Good stuff.	1
Great stuff	1
great job	1
Works well.	1
Very satisfied	1
This stuff is magic.	1
i have used this for years and never been dissapointed	1
This is good stuff. Makes the boot dark in color tho	1
Works great!	1
Works great as a weather-protectant, but they will darken the leather A LOT. I didn't have a problem with this as I was unhappy with the color of my boots before applying it. They look great after application!	1
I use this product for waterproofing leather. Works well, and puts a slight shine on smooth leather.	1
My tired old work boots were thirsty. Picked up this based on reviews and it is really nice. Smells great, easy to apply and even made my hands soft for a couple days. Boots darkened up nicely, which I like but you should be aware that lighter boots will get dark.	1
This is really good stuff. Especially like the fact it's low melting temp so using bare fingers is enough to liquifie it.  Even used it on an old leather couch. It softened the dried leather remarkably.	1
Protects and conditions leather great.  Very waterproof. My biggest complaint is that it holds dust really well.	1
I hate how much this darkens the leather, but it waterproofs well and that's what I needed.	1
Excellent product.  Easy to apply,  absorbed easily into the leather.  Applied to a pair of boots that had leather scraps from hiking the AT and it worked wonders on making the boots almost look like new.  Great product.	1
good	1
Works well for my new boots.  Glad that I searched your sight before purchasing something in town.  Your comments were very helpful with my purchases!	1
warmed up boots by heater vent and applied a liberal amount of wax to them with cloth. Works well I'll now more when I begin using these new boots outside daily. There is enough here to last a lifetime! It doesn't take much and the smaller container would be more then enough for years.	1
i have used this brand for years on my Mephisto boots and they are looking great. They leave hardly any residue. Of a vassoline consistency	1
Works great to protect leather.  I'm currently using it on a pair of 1883 Wolverine dress boots.  It allows me to make around the snow and slush in the winter on my way to my office job.  It seals out the water really well.  I applied it twice the first week I owned the boots.  Now I reapply once a month or so and wipe the boots off every week in between applications with a slightly damp cloth.  The product does leave the leather soft, but the leather on my boots was extremely soft pull up leather to begin with.  It goes on shiny, but by the time it dries, it has a very matte look to it.  Don't expect a polish shine, but it's not dull either.  It dries to a very neutral look.  This really needs to applied with a bare hand.  The warmth of your hand melts it making it easy to spread and rub into the leather.  It's great how it works.  I relate it to cotton candy how it dissolves instantly in your mouth.  This stuff is like a hard wax, but just melts to a liquid as soon as you begin to rub it into your leather boots.  The smell is mild and just smells like leather to me.	1
My short term, 1 month review, is that I love it. It's pretty easy to rub in, it does darken the leather up some, but walking in wet grass in my Iron Rangers sees water just bead up. I did two applications a day apart, and last week weekend (about a month after the applications), I spent a long morning doing some dog training in wet grass. The water soaked through a bit, so I'll do a fresh application and give it a shot again this weekend. Overall, really happy so far and appreciate the info that this mix does not contain some of the un natural products in other conditioners that are long term harmful for the leather. I do have some wrinkles in the boots where I hadn't taken good care of them before so we'll see how long term applications of Obenauf's treats that.  2.5 months in now, it's still a great treatment. It hasn't repaired the damage i've done to my boots, but it's keeping the leather as nice as it can, and it's not damaging the leather.	1
I had been using mink oil for years before learning about this product.  I find I have to reapply mink oil frequently if I get my shoes/boots wet or dirty.  The Obenauf LP lasts much longer if you apply a couple coats as recommended.  In fact, I haven't needed to reapply at all on my boots that I have repeatedly warn in the dirt/salt/snow.  I just wipe them down with a damp rag and they're good to go.	1
If you like your boots covered in dust and sand it's great, it's sticky and I don't think it helped my boots it hurt them in the long run.	-1
Heavy duty and works great. Will darken any leather other than real dark leathers. Once it starts to lighten again, you know its time for another application.	1
Use it on my leather belt and it keeps the belt very soft and flexible	1
Great stuff. I waterproofed my Thoroughgood leather boots with these. Put two coats on with my bare hands. Warmed it up a little with a heat gun and just dipped my fingers in and rubbed into the leather. WARNING: This will darken the color of the boots a little bit.	1
WOW! Before and after use are significantly different. Works great	1
This leather preserver is pretty easy to apply to my boots.  A small dab will cover one boot.  4 oz should last a long time.  I coated two pairs of boots, and barely made a dent in my supply.  I live in Minnesota, so I've used both pairs of my boots in the snow a bit.  Water beads up like you would expect, and shakes off easily when I come inside.  After a couple of months of light use outside (mainly just walking my dog a few blocks or walking to the bus stop), I don't feel a need to re-apply it anytime soon.  The only issue I have is that the preserver darkened my boots a bit.  I recommend trying it first on hidden spot like under the laces to make sure you don't mind the change.  I really don't mind the change, but it was something I noticed.	1
I like this much, much better than Sno-seal. Application is very easy. I'll even take the lid off of the jar and microwave it for 20 seconds to slightly soften it before application. I'll apply two thin coats about 8 hours apart. Highly recommend	1
got this for my work boots, made them look like new!	1
The best	1
Obenaufs products are some of the best leather treatments one can buy. Each one I have used, including this one, have worked as advertised and beyond my expectations. Just pick the correct product for your needs. This one is a serious preservative which I needed the outdoor leather pieces I  make and for my motorcycle items.	1
Awesome product. Only used it on Danner boots.	1
A little pricey but worth it.	1
I have tried any number of leather preservatives and waterproofing products over the years. I think this product tops my list of waterproofing products. Penetrates pretty well and doesn't seem to attract as much grit or dust as many others. Seems to have a lasting waterproofing effect. As a note, this WILL darken light leathers and mat suede and rough-out leather.	1
Made with bees-wax.	1
Great stuff....!!!	1
This stuff is great! I work around a lot of dust from concrete and road base which can quickly dry out your boots and the stitching. This product is superior to all other boot oils and conditions I have used in the past. It keeps my boots and the stitching moisturized and flexible. I have been able to get several months more out of my boots since switching to this with regular treatment (every other week). It also doesn't discolor at all. When I apply it to my Thorogood boots the color and leather itself looks brand new! I am pleased with it and will be ordering more when I run out.	1
Good stuff!	1
Great stuff. I put this on all my leather shoes (Harley Boots, Timberlines, and Doc Martins). This will darken the leather, but I'm too concerned with that.	1
a little goes a long way! apply a little on your leather and it is good to go! (rain or shine)	1
I first heard about this product while discussing boots with someone. Up to now I've been using mink oil paste, but noticed after a short time, mink oil lost its ability to bead water or fluids so I thought I'd try it. Like mink oil it darkens anything it soaks into so like everyone else is saying, make sure your cool with that. It does leave leather very soft to the touch without making it vulnerable to expansion. I was hoping for just an occasional usage but it appears I'll need to use it more often, maybe that was the mistake I made with the mink oil. Good thing I got the 8oz jar. Because of the versitile properties of bees wax I decided to try it on my raw wood Kali sticks which gave it sealing properties to the hardwood without using a varnish. It brought the grain out while sealing the raw wood. How's that for versatile. It applies with your fingers which makes it melt by your body temperature. Doesn't get any easier than that. Buy it I recommend it.	1
Been using for 6 months so far.  I just take a few minutes every week or so and apply it to my redwing boots.  Seems to work better than mink oil or anything else I've tried in the years.  I would recommend trying it.	1
I learned about Obenauf's from a Youtube channel "Wranglerstar" and I bought the 4oz and its by far the best leather care product I have ever used.  We have used it on everything from Logging boots, Belts to my wife's coach purses.  Love this stuff.	1
I bought this for the leather saddlebags on my bike, and it works great!  Makes the leather shine and protects them from the elements too.	1
Good quality stuff	1
works great	1
Great stuff.  Use it on wallets, shoes.  Not on fine leather like gloves.  Softens and depending on the leather will darken.  Try first	1
so it works great-- buy some..	1
I use this instead of Proofide on my Brooks saddles.  Works great, more cost effective.	1
Great leather oil. I use it on all my boots and it keeps them soft, smooth, and durable. The leather cracks when it dries out, so get some saddle soap and oil them up with this stuff to make your boots last longer and look better.	1
I now feel safe to brave the Minnesota winter with my leather soled boots and shoes. Nice product!	1
I use this product on all of my leather goods, knife sheaths and especially my boots. This product is recommended by quite a few custom knife sheath makers.	1
YEP	1
Does what I purchased it to do.	1
Awesome stuff.	1
Good stuff, works to bring ife back to leather and revive color and luster to old shoes.	1
This wax works great, easy to apply and leaves a nice sheen to the leather.  You use very little to do a pair of boots so the 8ozs will last a long time.	1
Cheaply made had to modify the grabr made the forks an inch longer	-1
having a little trouble when operating spreader with tire, not enough clearence opening spreader with tire.	1
Great product to use on leather boots or shoes. This product protects your boots from ware and gives you boots some water resistance and resistance to other elements. It also smells good. I was searching for a good product to protect my boots with for a while and this is the best one I've found.	1
Long time fan.	1
Sending and packing very quickly. This product corresponds to the image. Thank you!	1
THANKS	1
Love this stuff. Use on your fine leather goods. Bring those Vintage Leather purses to better then anything you can buy new. If you love leather. This is the stuff you need. Works on shoes and Horse Tach great too.	1
Must have for leather shoe owners.	1
Works.  Less expensive products that work equally well.	1
A new product for me.  It was for use on leather saddlebacks on my motorcycle that are exposed to a lot of sun.  It seems pretty hard core (in a good sense).  I'm happy with it.	1
best boot treatment I've ever used!	1
Keeping my Red Wings protected and looking great. Thank you.	1
I'm not wild about the smell. It's not offensive - I'd just rather that there weren't much of a smell. I'm using it on a pair of gloves, rather than a pair of boots, so I suppose I smell it more. I haven't had much of a chance to evaluate its waterproofness.	1
Great product have been using it for years with good results!!!!	1
This stuff is great! A little goes a long way. I used it on my old Danner's and it made them look like new again. Will definitely be using this stuff on my heavy leather work boots from now on!	1
great stuff...already posted a review. it does darken your leather, which will lighten back up a bit over time, but this is the most amazing stuff i've ever used and would use no other on my western boots!	1
This stuff is amazing.  Kept my leather boots waterproofed pretty much all winter.  Next winter I might do two coats for super protection.	1
I first learned about this product from my good friend Cody who runs the Wrangler Star YouTube channel, check him out and subscribe to his content.  It's truely outstanding.  This is one of those miracle products, it's made with bees wax and I put it on everything leather I own.  It brings it back to life and makes it waterproof.  You put it on the leather item until the leather won't drink anymore up.  I found that placing the leather goods in a sunny window speeds the process up.  It smells amazing because it's bees wax and it works great on car/ truck seats too.  Over the years I've put countless guys onto this stuff and they too love it.  It polishes too, it's not a dramatic shine like a traditional toxic dye type polish but it's adequet and is for guys/girls who actually use their stuff, so if you work for a living in the elements or ride horses, motorcycles or just enjoy dry feet your wrong to not use this product.	1
This product is non greasy and easy to apply.  It has a pleasant scent too.  looks like this container will treat my boots many times.. Will be interesting to see how often I have to reapply.  I'm trying to protect boots against mud and mortar. April 2015.  10/4/2015.  Used this on my Danner Vicious boots, about once a month.  The boots have no cracks, and the LP keeps mortar from sticking to them.  I just put 2 applications on my new Danner Quarry insulated work boots.  Great stuff.	1
Works like a charm. Brought my belt back to life and kept the rain out of my work books. I like the dark look it gives leather.	1
This stuff is good. It will darken the leather that you apply it to, but is is very protective and keeps it clean and conditioned.	1
It takes a few days to not feel tacky but after that, wow.  Love this stuff.	1
excellent product	1
excellent leather product	1
Good stuff and great preservative. Goes on pretty easily, will Slightly darken the leather depending on the boot/shoe. One pair it darkened slightly and after it absorbed totally they went back basically to the color they were previously, but then on an Apache finish pair of cowboy boots it darkened them a shade or two. Which is OK. It can be rubbed in with your fingers or a soft cloth. Just take your time and work it into the seams. I like this better than Huber's Shoe Grease. Definitely smells better, has a pleasant beeswax smell, whereas Huber's smells like a campfire.	1
This stuff is great for preserving your leather and helps keep out water. I use it on everything leather.	1
Love this product. It slightly darkened a pair of my boots. But they look like a new pair of boots. I also used this to help break in a pair of new Chippewa boots. The boots come very stiff. But this product help soften the leather a bit.	1
Oh boy, I made the mistake of putting this product on a very nice pair of boots whose light tan color I really liked.  This product turned the leather a dark matte color and two weeks later they are still sticky and everything on the floor sticks to them.  A sad, unfortunate mess.  I've tried brushing them everyday to try and get it off, but to no avail.  Lesson learned.  Use this product only for work boots that you need waterproofed and where color change is not an issue.	-1
great stuff fast ship  thanks much	1
This stuff makes my old boots look like new, and keeps the leather soft and pliable.	1
Great for boots. Apply with your warm hand, or with a rag, and use a hair dryer to heat and spread it if you have trouble spreading it.	1
amazing, in fact magical.  i have a lot of leather motorcycle jackets and western, as well as hiking, boots. so i'm not a neophyte when it comes to conditioners and preservatives. but i'd only purchased the liquid kind, and good brands.  this stuff is leagues beyond oil or liquid leather condidioners. bought it to darken several pairs of cowboy boots that the better leather oils/liquids did not really affect...including not really getting rid of the dryness of some boots, mostly new for that matter, that came dryer than i'd like.  the pairs of lucchese, justin and dan post didn't really show any difference from the oils/liquids after they soaked in and a month had gone by. so i figured there is something to using a thick cream/paste with a great reputation like obenaufs. and indeed there was.  first, it darkened (as i wanted) a full shade a much too light golden brown pair of justin bent rail distressed boots. at first it took some of the distressing away, but as the cream dispersed fully into the leather from the surface layer, some of that richness and 'damaged distressed' look came back, including the depth and richness of the leather.  next came the hard case, a pair of dan post distressed square toe apache 'earp' boots. have to say the uneven leather texture on these went beyond distressing, they had creases in inappropriate places (where wear would NOT take place) plus the color variation looked dopey, with the toes very dark like they'd been dipped in chocolate, and the rest of the boot with better looking variation. they were also dry as a bone (and that's NEW).  i'd already tried to darken and condition them a bit, but the oils, didn't help even after 2 applications. the LP was a different story, applied after a slight warming and partial liquification in my hand, it went into the leather like water in a dry sponge. the variety of shades from the distressing disappeared into a deep rich brown, which at least took away the chocolate-dipped toe look. BUT within several days the depth and richness of the distressed leather came back to a much lessened extent, but at least it looked real than the overdone original manner.  as the obenaufs dispersed deeper into the leather, drying into the boot...the magic began.  on boot trees, the leather began to reform and tighten around the boot trees, bringing great shape to the boots that they hadn't even had when i got them new a few months back...sorry dan post, but these had a rumpled and unequal look that was allegedly supposed to be 'distressing'.  after the obenaufs conditioned the leather, and tightened their rumpled look, helping lessen some awkward dimpling and creases, i got the idea of laying obenaufs into some particularly ill placed creases and dimples on one of the boots, figuring it might allow the leather to get needed moisture and conditioning so the creases and dimpled depressions could fill.  for once i was right about something, and after a day when the cream i'd laid into those depressions soaked in, it indeed lessened the creases and dimples. a little working in with my fingers, and pressing to flatten, helped. after a second such application, i removed almost completely one bad crease that no kind of wear would have ever naturally created, and had probably occurred by leaving too loose leather on the original wooden last during (bad) construction.  despite my problems with the original boot, after some work with the obenaufs, these are incredible...the best part being that virtually all of the dan post defects during manufacture were eliminated...and those that weren't, were lessened immensely so that if anything, they look like real distressing.  amazing stuff!	1
Perfect	1
Best Leather boot protectant I've ever used. Works against water, salt, chemicals, sun etc. Easy to apply, just rub it in with a finger and done. Two coats for lasting results. So easy.	1
Works great as a water proof leather preservative and protective from barnyard chemicals. Waterproofs too.	1
the best	1
Excellent Product that provides the protection I desired for my leather goods. Two things to keep in mind, this product will darken the leather when applied, and it is not for suede leather. The product works much better when applied warm. I place my leather good in an oven set on low to pre-heat the leather before applying. I use this on my boots, belts, and other leather work wear and all of my holsters and other miscellaneous leather goods.	1
Great product, works great on my leather boots.	1
Excellent product. Really does what it claims to do.	1
Works as stated	1
Excellent product. Easy to apply.	1
Works well to keep leather in good condition.	1
I like this wax but it doesn't completely waterproof leather, it just makes it water resistant and preserves it.  I have never been able to find a completely waterproof leather and I don't expect to. It's a no-brainer that rubber/nylon etc. are the best.  Obenauf's wax, leather preserver surely helps protect and condition the leather, just be aware that it does darken leather immensely. I purchased a light brown leather boot, applied the wax and no my boots are a very dark chocolate brown. I use my boots for work so I'm okay with it, I just liked the look better when they were a lighter color.  APPLICATION: I applied all 8oz of Obenauf's wax about 1 year ago on 3 pairs of lace up 6in high work boots, 1 used pair and 2 new pair.  I applied a very heavy initial application of Obenauf's wax on all 3 pair and then a second application. I warmed the the wax, rubbed it in heavily, used a hair dryer to make sure it soaked in the leather, and then applied a second coat.  DURABILITY: I wore two of the pair (Ariat "waterproof" and used Michelin Sledge non-waterproof) 6 days a week for the last year, after applying the wax.  After experiencing a few cracks around the top toe portion of the uppers on both the 5yr old Michelin and the 1yr old Ariat, I realize I should have applied a second coat of wax at least every 6 months, probably every 3-4 months.  (The Michelin boots are the toughest boot with the toughest leather I ever had, and I wore them most and abused them the most. When my Michelin get really bad I wash them in the washer, at least 2x a year.)  WATERPROOFING: After initial application, I got my boots wet under the shower and it did provide waterproofing. After wearing both pair (different outings) outside in the rain and on wet lawns the leathers soaked up water.  My feet did eventually get wet in the non-waterproof, non-lined Michelin Sledg but the Ariat with the factory "waterproof" liner kept my feet driest in the worst conditions. The Michelin Sledge never claimed any waterproofing at all. After applying Obenauf's wax they both performed better but also both eventually soaked up water into the leather in a single day. Sometimes water enters through seams and through the sock uppers.  Conclusion: I don't believe there's anything that can completely waterproof the surface of leather other than a rubber coating.  I believe the Obenauf wax is very good stuff, the best I've used and it protects the leather from most water and over drying however, I also believe because it makes the leather softer it can get damaged easier if you kick something or scrape it.  The best protection I have found for waterproofing is an all rubber boot OR any other boot material with a waterproof Gore Tex liner. Only then have my feet been completely dry. I am absolutely CERTAIN there is no MAGICAL cure and it's just a matter of current technology we have today. I feel too many people expect too much.	1
Really good stuff! Melts easy and goes on easy. The best leather preservative I've ever used. Smells pretty good too.	1
Excellent product.  I use it liberally, let it sit over night and wipe off excess next day.	1
If you've put out the money for quality boots, don't cut corners when it comes to maintaining them. You won't be sorry. This is super high quality stuff.	1
It's as good as everyone says.	1
A must have if you care about your leather goods.  I bought it for my boots, but have now used it on my leather dinning room chairs, weight belt, tool belt, and off course my boots.  Its thick but you can clearly feel the quality.	1
I will never again use a leather treatment/preservative from the shoe store! I apply this to my Zamberlans with my bare fingers. They look and feel like new after every application. (Be sure to clean your boots first) It doesn't leave a sticky/oily residue to attract and trap dust and dirt.	1
Awesome boot and leather conditioner and protector.	1
Not sure why anyone would give this product anything other that a 5 star review, but I am sure they have their reasons.  It will definitely darken your leather, but to what extent will depend on the leather you apply it to.  I applied it to some medium brown Double H boots, and it did darken it up a bit, but very much like Obenauf's Leather Oil, the darkness does seem to get lighter as the days pass.  This probably has something to do with the disbursement of the oil throughout the thickness of the leather fibers. Well that just my take on it.  So one might think that this is some pretty crazy thick stuff that one might only apply to heavy duty items as the name would suggest, but not so.  I tested this stuff (after using Obenauf's leather oil first) on a high end lamb's skin coat (of course I tested it on a hidden spot first).  Wow, is all I can say!  It will leave your smooth leathers kinda greasy at first, but let the leather rest for a few days in a hot dry environment.  Then rub the leather with a clean soft cloth to remove any of the excess residue that may be lingering on the surface, and what you will have will be silk.  I was so bold as to give the coat the water hose test.  A duck's back ain't got nothing on this coat!  Most people tremble at wearing a NICE leather coat if its going to rain, I say bring it on, and in fact, this coat will be the one I will choose to wear if it does plan to rain.  I chose this product, and their leather oil after doing quite a bit of online research as to what products are best for leather, and will not rot stitching.  Too many people were swearing by Obenauf's product qualities, so I decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  I just want to know why it took me all these years to find this product, and where and the hell this product was when I was working on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier!  I could have been so much more comfortable all those years had they sold this in the ship's store.	1
After finding a nice pair of leather boots for the fall weather, priority number one was getting the leather protected against the elements. After reading up online, I found that  Obenauf's LP is universally recommended, so I decided to give it a try.  Pros: Easy application - smearing it on with your fingers softens the wax just enough to soak into the leather Decent waterproofing - unless leather is really saturated with some product its never going to be impervious, but water beads nicely on my shoes and the time before it soaks in is greatly extended. This is after two applications to brand new leather. Great smell - the beeswax base of this means it smells great while working it in, with no chemical smell at all.  Cons: Slightly pricy, but two applications has only made a small dent in my 4oz jar. Larger boots or thirstier leather could use up quite a bit more, however.	1
Easy to use, works like a charm with my leather boots.  You can see the water beading up on the leather after use, and has protected my boots from the limited exposure I've had with chemicals.	1
This stuff is awesome. But doesn't go very far, buy the bigger size.	1
Fantastic for conditioning and treating all leather!  Natural product that is made in the USA, leather loves this stuff.  Very happy.  I am a Firefighter and use this on my suspenders and radio straps.  Wonderful!	1
I use this on all my leather shoes/boots.  It softens them up a little bit allowing for a more comfortable fit and seems to seal them very well.  I like the clean look they retain after using it and it is very easy to apply.  It will darken the color of your leather slightly, but has never been enough change to make me stop using it.	1
I hike extensively and only wear leather LLBean boots. I have used everything you can imagine for water proofing and the all work to one degree or another but this formula is by far my favorite. this order was to simply renew the last batch that I have used up. I have used it on scabbards , holsters , belts and leather laces.	1
Excellent product.  Easy to apply without being messy.	1
Great product would recommend too anyone who asked	1
Great lube	1
helps ... but did not last	1
great	1
Will buy again.	1
Worked great on hubby's leather work boots. He puts it on once a month to keep them waterproofed and the leather has stayed like brand new. It darkened it slightly, initially, but didn't take away from the look of the leather, at all, and water now just beads off. Great purchase!	1
Don't like it. It ruined my new boots. They look old and dull now.so disappointed. I'm crushed!	-1
Smells and looks great.	1
good	1
The BEST!!!	1
this is great stuff. I learned about it from Wranglerstar on Youtube. he has great videos on boots, choosing them and caring for them to last a long time	1
I used this on my natural leather belt and it provided great protection!	1
great stuff, wouldnt use any other product now	1
This stuff is worth the hype it gets. I like my boots waaay better after a couple applications of this stuff and some breaking in. I used it on a pair of caterpillar abe boots (oxe blood) and they're a great vintage looking boot now. I've also used this as lip balm like they say and it does fine for that too. Use it on anything leather and it'll give it that great looking shine and soft touch. Great product!	1
I use LP after letting the item soak up some Obenhauf's leather oil. This makes a nice "finishing" treatment and buffing compound. It also helps water and weather proof your leather items. I will use no other brand of leather car products from now on. Obenhauf's has saved more of my leather items than I can count.	1
got this for my knife sheath it was recommended by a lot of people for natural ingredients. its greasy at first but it goes away so it doesnt stay greasy like other treatment out there. recommended to anyone who has leather..	1
It works pretty well but it's not totally waterproof and it darkens leather.  I used this on some leather work boots and it worked pretty good. I did not like how much it darkened my boots but for work it doesn't matter. Wet grass and rain still let my boots soak up water, possibly through the seems, but still way better than silicone sprays or nothing at all. You do need to reapply a liitle for surface wear every six months or so.  The size heavily coated 3 pair of 6 inch high top lace up boots, once each.	1
I purchased to waterproof and help break in a new Brooks bicycle saddle.  However, I have subsequently used it on a belt and a pair of shoes both of which I thought I would have to replace.  Once they were treated with Obenauf's they looked almost brand new.  I have found in each case that it really helps if you put the treated item in a warm oven at around 150 degrees.  This seems to really help the leather absorb the preservative.	1
This is a great way to treat work boots!  My work boots get dusty and dirty and well...they are WORK boots!  I just got a new pair of Justin Gore Tex work boots and wanted to treat them right.  The paste melts pretty quickly when rubbing in, so it really soaks into the leather.  I also used the leather oil from the same company as a base coat for no reason at all, but it worked well also.  I also used this on some leather belts and holsters and it really brought them back to life.  Good stuff.  It WILL darken the leather by a few shades, so don't say nobody warned you.	1
I used this as an original protectant on a new pair of Redwing work boots. I would highly suggest setting this in the sun for awhile before usage to soften it up. I used a small piece cut from a Sham Wow cloth to apply this product. This schtuff helped soften the new leather boots, and a couple of days after application I went back and put some brown Kiwi shoe polish on the boots. Wore the boots to work all winter and now into spring, and not a drop of water has found it's way into the boots to my feet.	1
I've only applied it once, but its working great. It did darken by Red Wing Iron Rangers, but I really like the richer color.	1
This stuff is awesome. Used to use the off the shelf store stuff, like Kiwi and campmore...never again. Brought a leather jacket back to life that was drying out. Put on bike saddle bags, wallet , boots, shoes, car seats......dog...well not the dog. I am both amazed and will purchase again and again. ......and yes a possum's belly is soft.	1
This stuff will soften hard, stiff leather and make it supple again. It adds a water-resistance to leather after it soaks in and conditions as well. It will keep your leather from cracking and wearing prematurely. Great great great stuff.  Only caveat is that this stuff will darken your leather. I don't find that to be an issue, but some do.	1
I got this to try after watching the youtube review by Wranglerstar. Previously I had used mink oil, which is what my dad used and i had learned from him. I have some nice leather goods, and plan on getting more in time and just wanted to take proper care of them. So far i really like the stuff. It kind of melts on your fingers and goes on smooth, the leather soaks it right up and then it kind of solidifies. It leaves the leather feeling nice and soft and supple. I really like it.  Over all I would HIGHLY recommend this product.	1
Bought this jar of Obenauf's and really like the result when I put it on some new wet weather boots.  Probably the best waterproofer I've used so far.  And it does no damage to the leather at all.	1
I used Obenauf's on My New Chippewa Bay Apache Harness Boots Model # 97868. I have applied 2 Coats. The Boots did get Darker after each Coat. It realy Helps if you Heat up the Obenauf;s LP First. I have used it on my Black Chippewa Harness Boots Before, It Really Works. Makes the Boot totally Water proof. Do not forget to put it on the Heal too. especially around the Seams and stitching. I waited one Day between each Coat. Obenauf's recommends to Waite 2 to 3 weeks. But, the first coat absorbed right in. I will Waite the 2 weeks after wearing them and apply a third Coat.	1
I really like this product. Waterproofs well and easy to apply.  Just use your fingers to apply and it goes on easy. Soaks in well and appears to let the leather breathe.  Used on about 8 pairs of leather boots of various colors.  It will darken slightly but love how all of them have turned out.  The leather has lightened up over time but still remained water proof. I will be doing more coats and we'll see how long it lasts without reapplying.	1
this product is amazing. hard to describe how excellent it is.  i've used other similar products but none are nearly as good (eg dubbin)  Tips: Apply to new shoes immediately. Don't wait for shoes to get dirty dusty or stained  use cedar wood shoe trees to maintain shape of shoe or boot  PROS:  Smells nice Applies easy (just use bare fingers to rub on) absorbs well into the leather really protects well makes leather softer/ more supple darkens light tan shoes (which is nice)  CONS:  none.	1
I purchased this to use on my work boots (Danner Acadia's) and western boots (HH) for the winter months. I was looking for something to protect my boots from the snow/slush/salt and so far this product is doing a great job. Smells great too!	1
This stuff work pretty darn good.  I like it better than the mink oil i normally use.  It even helps hide scratches.	1
I got this mostly for my boots as at times I end up having to tromp through mud and it always causes problems with drying and eventually cracking the boots.leather. Since I've been using this boot wax I haven't been having any issues with degrading boots. and water just sheds right off without an issue.  I've even used it on belts and other leather items that I own and it's helped breath a little life back into some very old leather products. It adds a rather nice smell to the leather as well.	1
The only product I use, and trust on my sheaths, and quality leather. It works well, smells great, and will keep your leather sheaths in great condition, even when you use them in harsh conditions! The best. Hands down! The only REAL option.	1
Wow! This stuff is just so amazing. I love it and so does all my leather goods as well as my skin and cuts. I have even used it on a cut after having cut my finger i was applying some Obenauf's by hand to a leather axe sheath and got it all over the cut. I did not wipe it off and just rubbed it into my skin and went about my business. I did this on a daily basis with a number of leather goods and began to notice how quickly my cut was healing over such a very short time frame and then it was gone. Amazing. So, since then I have not only used it on every piece of leather including laces that I own but on every injury I have gotten and it is just wonderful stuff. I only wish Amazon offered their gallon size. So, I went gone to the Obenauf's website and order it by the gallon. I highly recommend this and will be trying other products they offer.	1
My Wilson double-collar bomber jacket--a $25 find-of-the-decade from the local second-hand store--is like no other jacket I have ever worn. The dark brown leather is soft and supple, to be sure, but it's the design that makes this jacket irreplaceable: the inner collar that zips up the neck; the double-button cuffs; the durable brass hardware; the ventilated back panel that is cool for late spring, summer evenings, and early fall; and the zip-in liner that has kept me warm for three Northwest winters. It would be heartbreaking to lose it or see it damaged in some way.  So after a few years of wear out in the elements, the rich brown was starting to fade and dry, and I knew I needed to do something. I tried a little Lexol on the back panel. Meh... Darker and more supple, but also a bit "muddy-looking". Enter Obenauf's Leather Oil. I didn't really know what to expect, and I was a little terrified. I mean, I knew from all my reading that it would darken the leather, but I didn't have much insight into the process.  I gently wiped the oil on, section by section, using the funny little sponge applicator attached to the lid. I spread and massaged the oil in with my bare hands. It wasn't looking that great. I waited a day and decided that I might as well go for broke; perhaps another light coat would improve things. Afterwards, the jacket just seemed heavy and dark, with an almost oily matte sheen to it. Had I ruined it? Was this leather (calfskin, maybe?) too soft to be using this product? I nervously resolved to hang the jacket in a warm area of the house for a week; if it didn't improve, I would attempt to machine-wash the ugly oil out using a technique I had found on YouTube.  But Lo! It *did* improve! After about five days the oily sheen had disappeared, and by the end of the week the leather began to look richer than ever before, and I felt like wearing it again. Over the next few weeks the color and texture only improved, and more than a month later it has come to look freakin' AWESOME.  A month later, emboldened by my experience and now that the weather was turning cooler and wetter, I decided to add some rain-resistance with some Obenauf's Heavy-Duty LP. I zapped the little container in the microwave for about 15 seconds to soften the wax, and using a hairdryer to warm the jacket, I applied the LP over a selection of panels. One coat, only. The leather darkened a little more. It and my hands smelled like honey. The next day, the surface of the leather had a slightly waxy but still supple feel to it. Water beaded nicely on the surface.  After all of this, I am totally sold on Obenauf's.	1
Tried the rest, and this is the best!! It's not to cheap, But for me it's the only leather preservative to buy. Love the stuff!! Thanks Pitbullman	1
This is the best stuff EVER! I bought some at Big R years ago and it has lasted me though 10 or 15 boots and at least 6 pairs of shoes...and i still lave a little left! Works great on all types of leather. All i do is clean the boot or shoe really good, wipe with wet towel, let dry over night. Put the leather preservative on it in the AM. Try it you will not be disappointed! :~)	1
I bought this stuff after reading the online forums about ways to darken leather. I had bought a belt from Simply Rugged (terrible quality control and customer service...stay away from them!) and after they ignored my complaints about them sending me an almost white colored belt, I decided to try something to darken it. I applied 2 coats of this stuff over a 2 day period. I heated the leather with a blow dryer and rubbed the wax into the leather with my fingers. It smells like honey for a couple of days. I sat it out in the sun to dry and my leather belt was easily 5 shades darker. That was about a month ago and the color has stayed from daily use.  THAT SAID... I was afraid to use it on my beed because of this darkening. I was only with a few shades but it made me nervous how dark it turned the leather, and how it seems to be a pretty permanent change. I would say if you either want to, or don't mind, darkening your shoes or leather goods, or they are black to begin with, this stuff is the best there is. Just beware that your tan leather will become a med-dark brown.	1
This is a wonderful product, i used it on my boots to make them waterproof and a little softer. it worked great but while it did initially darken the boots, they did get lighter again after a week or so. One warning though, if you live in a topical climate like the Florida Keys where you have Palmato roaches no matter what you do, they are highly attracted to the honey smell and will chew the surface of your boots! I had to store my boots in a bag after using this on them.	1
Well, packaged all wrong and arrived cracked all to smithereens. I was about to return this but had the LP tub that I was replacing to scoop this one into. I've used mink oil, snake oil and other products but nothing comes close. This will give your boots an oiled look, a cared for look, an expensive look. This will renew your baseball glove. This will give new life to your saddle or leather scabbard. My boots are over 10 years old, on their 2 or 3rd new heel and 2ad re-sole and still shed water. I would not use this on my leather pickup seats, there is a Lexol for that.	1
Started using LP in 2009 for a cross country run on a Harley from California to New York and back.  Found it to be the best product for heavy leather jackets and chaps subjected to the pounding of thousands of miles.  It also is great for the bike's leather (seats, saddle bags etc.) Just ran out of my first jar and am reordering prior to a run to Milwaukee.	1
Used on boots.  Really waterproof, it works into the leather and water just beads off.  Also used it on other types of leather, and while propolis does change the color to a dark, rich shade, it's the best leather preservative out there, period.	1
I really like this stuff. My sister bought a handbag in mexico and loved it, well i knew she was going to ruin it because it was not cared for, cracked and stiffed. i offered to fix it, when i found this online. She paid for it, and it worked great. it even restored the leather, even though it is a preservative. i got the 4 oz jar and for restoring items i recommend you get the 8 oz, because it takes a lot more than just preserving. i also used it on a pair of boots that were a little stiff, and absorbed a little water, and didn't take much. get the 8 oz if you're doing a jacket for sure. DOES DARKEN LEATHER.	1

renewed a leather jacket made it like new very good for harder leather items (boots, etc) takes a little time to apply to a large jacket smells wonderful (not synthetic - can apply with bare hands) protects well, lasts	1
Bees wax is amazing stuff not only does it condition leather, your skin and extends the life of your leather goods all the while keeping you dry and working.  It can also be used to shine your boots and shoes.  I use it on everything, gloves, boots, shoes, car/truck seats and jackets, it makes anything leather instantly better.  Just put on layers until the leather won't absorb it anymore and buff to a shine with a brush and your ready for work or play.	1
Forget the rest!! This is the best!! I've tried a few different protectors, sno-seal isn't bad, but then theres obenauf's, smells great , easy to apply, you can feel and see the quality. I did two coats on my new lowa renegades,even thought they have a gortex liner, the water never gets past the leather now. and it hasn't hindered the breathability of the boot at all. It did turn the serpa color a shade darker, but I like it. Great boot, the best leather protector. I'm a happy outdoors man. Thanks Pitbullman	1
This product soaks in the leatehr very well.  If you have old leather shoes that are dried out, this will rejuvenate them to almost new looking.  (Obviously, it won't overcome deep scratches, cracks, or gouges).  It does darken the leather significatnly, so if you have light leather that you don't want the shade to change, this may not be the product for you.  If you want to re-condition leather and are OK with darkening, this is far superior to other products I've used.  (snoseal; beeswax; etc)	1
Obernauf's definitely helped preserve and restore the condition of all the leather I've used it with so far.  I noticed the water-repellant benefits seem to wear off fairly quickly (matter of a week or two).  I'm going to try more than one coat though and see if that helps.  Also, it seems like the 4oz container will last forever!	1
I've used this product on all of my boots.  From hunting to dress, to general outdoor work, and it performs great.  Gives the leather a nice shine and I think it lasts a decent amount of time.  I've used other leather products in the past and this is the only one I'll buy now.	1
Thick solid paste at room temperature like bees wax.  Snow Seal is still solid but more liquid (cheaper in price).  Hard to tell any real difference between the two products other than temperature and ease of use.  Guessing Obenauf's LP Boot Preservative product may be better at waterproofing do to it's thicker nature but when applying this product it and the leather should be very warm, almost like you want a vat of heated liquid bear grease or this stuff to dip you gloves into.  Seriously scooping out a glob  and rubbing it in to leather gloves repeatedly at room temperature works.  Takes several hours after or overnight for the product to be fully absorbed until then they are sticky mess.  Several coats are needed and your gloves will never be waterproof but it far better than nothing at all.  If you want waterproof use rubber gloves over a glove liner.	1
This stuff really works good and appears to REALLY seal the boot seems along the stitching well too. I prefer this over the oil version of this same product.	1
This was my first season using Obenauf's and I was pleasantly surprised. Starting off it went on nice and melted in my hand when applying. The boot leather absorbed most of the product and water marks from a full hunting season where non-existant.  The kicker is the smell compared to other products... no strong odor and rather pleasant. When I have used other products the sent lingered for a long time. Obenauf did not but really I would not have minded if it did... I have found my new boot preservative.	1
I began using LP in 1996 when I started fighting forest fires in Northern Idaho.  Funny enough, thats where and why it was invented.  The store where I bought my fire boots (huge, bomb-proof logger boots) told me that this was what I should use. The boots took five years of every kind of abuse from submersion to heat to wood ash and LP kept them soft, waterproof and wearable.  I tromped through fire and ash, planted trees in spring rains, crossed creeks and slogged through knee-deep mud and as long as I wasn't actually working in the creek all day, my feet stayed pretty dry--no blisters. I use it on my work and hunting boots now and, though it will darken lighter leather, there is nothing better.  I have used mink oil (terrible), pure lanolin (not bad), sno-seal, pure bees wax (a close 2nd), and silicone (smelly) and this is the real deal.  I also use it on leather gloves and baseball mitts; anything leather that needs moistened, softened or waterproofed. Don't expect anything to permanently waterproof boots.  This will not give you the same protection of rubber boots and if they are cheaply made no grease or wax will keep water out of loose stiching. I don't usually melt it; the heat from your fingers applying it is usually good enough though once in a while I set them near the wood stove (3-4 feet away, no closer) to let it penetrate. Clean leather is better of course but even if you can't get them clean it can be applied to dirty leather with pretty good results. I will never use anything else.	1
I love this product!  I use it on my cowboy boots that I actually wear at the barn to ride horses.  Those boots see mud, dirt, animal droppings, you name it...and they wipe off cleanly and my boots still look fantastic and new!  (You can even still see the green threaded designs on the top of the foot as being green!  The mud couldn't stain the thread!)  The only negative I've found with this product is that you rarely ever have to reapply it!  (Which isn't really a negative!)  I reapplied after a few months (like I would with cheaper, not-as-good products) and the finish on my boots got waxy and the wax cracked from too many layers of the product.  (Which I easily washed/lightly scrubbed off the excess and the boots looked great again.)  So basically, don't use too much!  You'll be surprised at how little you really need to make it work...don't put it on thick!  I ordered the larger tub offered and I will honestly never use it up.  (And trust me...I have A LOT of shoes.)  If you only have a few pairs you're thinking of using this product on, get the smaller tub...you'll still have plenty left over for all your friends and family.  This stuff is so good, I put it on a very old pair of boots that I had and later took the boots into a shoemaker to be repaired and he couldn't apply his special chemicals too the boots...the chemicals rolled right off!  (Possible negative...he couldn't get the product OFF the boots to put the chemicals on, so he ended up not being able to repair them.)  He had never seen anything like it so he ordered a hug tub himself to use in his shop for firefighter boots!	1
I bought it to use with my SUP but it does not work as well on that big board or boards.  Works great with regular Surf Boards and attaches easily with straps.	1
We purchase to carry to SUPS, one 12'6' the other 10'^'' on top of our fullsize Tahoe with Yakima round bars. We previously transported with Yakima pads on the bars and 4 dirt bike straps pulling from each side by doubleing the straps back so each pair pulled against each other. The Thule seemed like a better way, the brackets do fir around the Yakima bars, but are not molded, indented to index properly, thus they twist under load. The included straps might hold down a skate board but are not nearly long enough for SUPs. We also purchased the Thule surf strap however it was incompatible without disassembling  the rack. All in all I am very disappointed, I'm still using the 4 straps and have spent an unnecessary $100.00	-1
I had one of these in the past on my Honda Elements and wanted to pick up for my FJ cruiser as it is so easy to use.  Simple pull and cinch.	1
Great surf rack. The board is cradled by the rails and rides securely on the rack. When the straps are cinched, the board is totally secure on the roof.	1
Got this to hold a 90 Lb 14 foot folding Portaboat on my roof rack. It work so great !!! It will hold a surfboard with the greatest of ease. GREAT PRODUCT !!!	1
These jumper cables are well built. They come with a bag and are easily stored. I bought them for my wife and they are not too big and bulky. The only thing that upset me was the fact that Ron Paul is not President of the United States yet. I would recommend this product to anyone that needs affordable 6 gauge Jumper Cables!	1
nice set of jumper cables!!!!  good heavy gauge for faster charging.  recommended for anyone traveling with an older battery that may quit on them.	1
Very heavy duty.  Great price!  I have owned many jumper cables thru the years.  This combination of heavy gauge, long length and great price cannot be beat	1
We've got 3 of these things.  Absolutely awesome generators that are powerful, quiet, and extremely fuel efficient.  The only downside is that Honda stopped selling the parallel kit for the 3000's and we had to buy an aftermarket parallel kit from someone else.	1
I have one, and right now after Irma came to say hello  this past weekend in S Florida, and power went out, this generator certainly earning it's money. It's not only fuel efficient, and not noisy like others and running two homes (my neighbor), since power is out.  It's running two refrigerators, Fans, lights, 3 TV sets, U-verse and fans to keep cool in 90 degree temperature.  Most important my computer, be lost without my computer. The unit has electric start is life savor.  My only recommendations I can make is they sell set of wheels to mount, worth price for the set, so you just roll it into position, lock the wheels. PLEASE do not run a generator in a house, they just reported family died by running there generator in the house! USE it a well ventilated area outside, PLEASE! In 2005 hurricane Wilma I had to use it for 14 days, what a life saver it was, trying living today without power.	1
great generator works as expected	1
My work ran 20 of these to power fiber systems in the field. We'd run them 15 hours a day, and they almost never failed. They're quiet enough so that at 20' you're not sure it's running. The only downside is it's HEAVY. Not easy for one person to move. (with gas) I tried to buy a used one when they replaced the entire line, but they sold all to a single buyer.	1
Quick shipment and outstanding quality. Runs great and very quiet.	1
I'd be hard pressed to purchase another brand.  Some people complain about having to hook up the battery and put oil in.  Of course, that takes all of 2 minutes.  This gen rocks!  You can easily talk over it.  When I walk by a food truck night and all the trucks have those chainsaw sounding generators, my son always tells me how much better he likes ours.  He's a smart id.	1
This Honda EU3000iS Inverter is an absolute monster! I owned a Honda EU2000i a couple years ago and personally know how good the Honda brand is, build quality and dependency of these inverters. A few close friends recommended i get something cheaper from Costco like the Champion brand but the reviews were mixed, from people hating it to people swearing by it. Personally, i have never heard someone complain about a Honda inverter and that is why i decided to pay the extra money and get something that i know will last me quite some time if taken care of properly.  I purchased this Honda inverter from "Hardware Sales Inc" and it arrived in a couple days. Product was completely brand new and packaging was very will intact.  TIP: The inverter comes with push start, however the battery is disconnected internally for "shipping reasons" on arrival. At first i didn't know that and was a bit confused but did some research and found out why it wouldn't work. So i took the front facing plastic cover piece off and yeah, the battery was disconnected. Since i took the plastic piece off i decided that i might as well charge the battery too so i did just that. Next day i connected it and put it all back together. Bought Pennzoil full synthetic 10W-30 (I live in California) and filled it to the brim. Everything worked just fine and so did the push start.  Earlier today i took this out on a job site for a welding job and was pleasantly surprised at how easily it handled my welder. The welder i used was a "Lincoln Electric Weld Pak 140 HD ". Sure it isn't the biggest or beefiest welder, but it still is a welder nonetheless. The generator never gave out or sounded like it was under a lot of stress and was pretty quiet for the most part. So i am very happy with that.  In conclusion, this generator is a beast! Really! It is a little on the heavy side for one adult but two should be able to move it around no problem. It is also very quiet and you can have a clear quiet conversation with a person about 10 feet away from it not a problem. For the amount of power it packs and how quiet it is,you can not go wrong with it. Before i bought this, i looked for something cheaper, but something cheaper won't always mean it'll be as dependable and reliable. So i pulled the trigger and bout the Honda and didn't look back. At the rate that ill be using this generator, this will last me a lifetime. Don't look for a cheaper alternative, spend the money and buy this and take care of it and never worry about replacing it ever again.	1
I bought my Honda EU3000is over 3 years ago and it is still running strong.  I run mostly on Solar, but during those long grey winter days I cannot survive without this beauty.  Quiet, trouble free and  reliable.  I've read some complain about the warranty, but I cannot speak to that because I've never had to use it and have never had it in the shop.  It just always runs first time and every time I start it. Yes it is a bit expensive, probably more pricey than it needs to be; but I guess that's because Honda knows it's the best, and they want money:/ Amazon's price is a little higher than the price I paid for it locally, and this item bought from a local Honda vendor also includes a year of free service from that local vendor.  "Which I never had the need to use", but it is good to have a fall back just in case; right?	1
Make your camping neighbors happy, use the 3000is for your power needs.  We've done a lot of RVing, and hands down the most neighbor-friendly generator you can buy is this one...  Ours has 2000 trouble free hours on it providing all the power we've ever needed...	1
Very Happy	1
Compared to a 16 Gauge cable, seems the copper is even thinner than that. It's not as pictured either - it's yellow/black and a much cheaper version (especially the battery clamps are super-cheap).  Overall, not satisfied. Can't return it because I cut the cable (really needed it to connect other equipment to a battery with custom connectors), otherwise it would go back. Now it will go straight to garbage.	-1
Nothing fancy but it does what I need it to do, give me a jump start.  Unless you have an unusually large vehicle, this will do just fine.	1
Outstanding. I would buy this item again if needed. It fits just right with no problems at all. Buy It.	1
Strong. Does the job for surfboards on a Wrangler JK.	1
excellent load bars as expected	1
Slide the bars on to the Podium Foot and make sure you have the same amount of overhang on each side. As you tighten up the 4 bolts of the Podium Foot, the bar locks into place making for a sturdy roof rack.	1
Perfect load bars for my RX330. I use them to carry my roof top bike rack. Work great!	1
Works as expected -thule quality	1
Product arrived quickly and feels sturdy enough to hold a lot of weight.	1
Nice quality.	1
Heavy duty and works great!	1
Solid square load bar for kayak/canoes. It fits my 9.5 ft kayak along with my 14 canoe old town next to each other with additional space left over. It would not fit 2 kayaks and canoes flat. It does not stick out any further than mid part of side mirrors on my yukon. It is compatible with the load bar from thull. Only complaints that I noticed is that the coating is not very durable as I have a huge gash across one of the bars (not sure if from the rounded part of canoe bolt end or from combo of heat/pressure); also the rack will make a whirling noise when traveling on highways (55mph and up) which is very noticeable unless radio is on; I remove the racks during off seasons so it does not bother me at all but I can see when you may consider their additional part that blocks the wind for it from thull. I know some mentioned end caps may fall out but I have not had that issue although I put silicone (same stuff for plumbing or pool o rings) around the inside part to keep out moisture which may have helped that issue.	1
I have used several sets of these over the years.  Decent quality but, as most Thule stuff, overpriced.  So 5 stars for quality, 3 for price, averages to 4.	1
The bars seem flimsy, not rigid like my round bar rack from a different manufacturer.	-1
I decided to surprise my husband with Thule racks. We've had Yakima in the past but I was able to get the Thule at a better price by "shopping around" (thanks, Amazon!). He loves them! Now he can carry his stand up paddle board on top of his car instead of trying to make it fit inside the car!!	1
I love the size of these bars, they fit great on my 3500.  I'm able to lay two large Kayaks down on top of them and still have room.	1
Good product. Will work on a Prius 2011. I bought it with the Thule 480 traverse foot pack and the 1566 fit kit.	1
Pricey, but solid.  Highly recommend.	1
Awesome bulletproof Thule bars, as usual.	1
These work 100% as advertised.  My only complaint is the wind noise.  It's pretty loud, but I guess that's why they sell the aerobars and wind deflectors.  I remove mine when I don't need them because of the noise.	1
Stupid fast delivery and just as described.	1
I purchased a 2015 F150 and needed to upgrade my load bars for my Thule Kayak Hullavator system. I was using 58" bars on a 2013 F150 and they were just barely long enough. After measuring the old bars (58") on the new truck, I was worried they wouldn't be wide enough for my Hullavator system so I purchased the 65" bars (as suggested by Thule). I'm glad I did as the shorter bars would have allowed the kayak lift to hit the side of my truck.  They're standard Thule roof bars. I've used the same brand for the past 9 years and never had a problem with them so I'm fairly certain these will hold up for the long run as well.	1
These are strong, but...... the wind over them creates a mid range hum when I hit about 40 mph and above. It can get monotonous after awhile hearing that hum on long road trips.	1
Looks wide, but they don't extend much further, if at all, than the side view mirrors on our 2002 Taurus wagon.  Great for carrying multiple canoes securely for any sort of distance at highway speeds.	1
Great bars but they do not include end caps! I have no idea why they would shoew then in description and not come with it that is why they only get a 2 star rating from me!	-1
for this price this product should have endocaps.  The picture shows endcaps and one would assume for $100 these would be included.	-1
No caps included.  Really!?!  Is this too much to ask?  It is hard to believe that ordering Roof racks has so much deception involved.  Yakima won't give parts numbers unless you go to a dealer, Thule leaves out pictured parts.  Now I have to chase these caps down before installation.  What else don't I know about this deal?  Make sure you understand what I am saying: If ordering is not clear, it is NOT A QUALITY item. Go to a product that promotes honesty.  I am open to suggestions.  Right now I am considering sending the whole deal back.	-1
Fits my 09 ford flex. Works well. There is some noticeable wind noise but not unbearable.	1
good quality and as advertised	1
Just as I expected from Thule. Thanks, RJMead.	1
Fit and look great. Can't wait to strap down some coolers and skis to them this weekend and drive up the mountain.	1
No end caps despite the photos clearly showing them...loads of reviewers were similarly disappointed ..	-1
These are a set of sturdy cross bars that do the job.	1
four inches too short for the f 150 2012	-1
these are the size for your f150 screw 2012	1
Its a bar.  Havent moves it since we installed it.  Seems to be holding up great after 3 years.	1
I bought the roof rack system and it has worked flawlessly every time. I have this on a 2012 Fusion,  with a hard carrier mounted on top. Once you learn how to install them, they greatly increase the capacity of your car. I've used them for about 10K miles worth of travel and they're worth every penny. I dropped about 6 MPG with my carrier on top, but had a roomier car in which to travel. If you want increase the functionality of your car, then get'em.	1
They work great, they do not come with the end caps, but that was said in the listing. With nothing on them they whistle driving down the highway. We were able to fit two canoes on just fine.	1
Perfect for converting my utility trailer for use with J-mounts for kayaks.  This aging gent no longer has to lift heavy kayaks onto a vehicle roof, but can slide them up onto the mounts on the trailer	1
good	1
very good +++++	1
Got this wider rack bar to enable my carrying two or three kayaks comfortably. IT is strong and accepts all my Thule rack systems.	1
No rust or any issues with the bar.  Will probably get rid of the feet and move this bar to the suv.  Can also use this to polevault or beat the hell out of someone.	1
I bought a pair of these LB58 load bars for my 2000 Isuzu Trooper. They are very well-made, however they do produce a fair amount of wind-noise at highway speed (especially with the sunroof open). However, wind noise aside (which I read about before purchasing them), they function well. I took off 1 star for the end caps, which aren't super-secure. They haven't fallen off yet, but it's only a matter of time before one does. Just remember to keep an eye on the caps after loading your ride, check the ground before you drive off.	1
I can't believe how much these simple square bars cost. Not worth it. I bought them new and they arrived scratched and dinged up. The end caps aren't very secure and fall out easily. Thule is ripping people off in my opinion.	-1
I didn't know this had to be rated as well. But, this is part of the setup I bought for our 94 BMW 740Il, it will also fit our Datsun 510.	1
Used these bars with my Crossroads Thule feet combined with my roof-top box for my trip to/from NY this year.  Works great, great fitment.  Love it	1
The square bars are obviously loud because they're not aerodynamic, but with the wind fairing, the noise is eliminated. I have a 2012 honda accord and thule recommended 58" bars. They're much too long unless you don't mind them sticking out about 7" on each side from the car. I finally bought a hack saw and cut them down so they only stick out about 1.5" now. I much prefer the sleeker look.  Cutting them shorter: If you decide to cut them shorter, I'd recommend positioning the bars so that one side is the length you want sticking out (the 1.5" for me). The other side will stick out much longer. Put the caps on the short side only. Once mounted on car, measure the longer side to the same length as the short side. I used painters tape and wrapped it around so I had a line for where I was cutting. I then sawed it off while it was on the car, which gave leverage. Then once the long side was the same as the short, I put the caps on. I hammered my caps a bit so that they were on good.	1
You can not get any better racking system than this, it fits the car perfectly, it arrived on time, packaging was in great shape.	1
I was able to successfully install these load bars onto the roof of my car and carry two sea kayaks on them.	1
I purchased the extra long load bars in order to carry two canoes. The bars are plastic coated steel and at 78" are quite heavy. These should have been made from aluminum for fuel savings and manageability. Overall they do what they are supposed to do. Note there are no end caps included. It would be prudent to buy them if you don't have them to keep the wind noise down, keep from dinging your head on them, and to keep the water out as they will rust inside. They really should be included for the price of these bars.	1
These bars work good on my car and for the bike rack that I have installed on them. The only complaint I have is that the rubber coating on the outside isn't very strong. The pedals on my bike are chewing up that coating  when they get spun in the wind	1
Bought this with the 1566 fit kit and Traverse feet for 2012 Prius.  The bars are sturdy and easy to install, perfect for the car top box or a canoe/kayak.  NOTE: if you JUST buy the bars, they do not come with the end caps; they are a separate purchase.  The end caps DO come with the foot kit.	1
Insane! - Love the Thule Line of products - Tossed my Car Top Tent on top of it (Tepuitents.com) and off I go into the wild Green Forest!	1
I give the 5 star rating for the superb quality of the product, that the young sales representative at REI pointed out is the only rack manufacturer conducting accident performance studies. There are many available rack systems available at many different price points, Thule is at the top but appear to be worth the difference.	1
If I had it to do all over again, I would have gone with the Aero bars instead of the rectangular ones.  These bars are incredibly sturdy as I carry 2 kayaks on top of my car.  However, if there is nothing on the car, they are incredibly noisy.  And you may say well why not use a wind deflector, because it blocks the view from my sunroof.  Also, when washing my car, the lead bar is absolutely covered in bugs from kicking down the highway.  So be prepared for that.	1
Have used my Thule rack/bars for some time now. Always in use and never a hint of a problem. The Best.	1
product was best priced, received in no time, it was a gift and the person receiving the product has no problems with it	1
These bars are far superior to round.  Although they are not as aerodynamic, the accesories that you mount to them can't rotate and slip around the bar.  With the round bars accecories can rotate down because you can not generate enough friction in the bar to prevent it.  Hands down the best inexpensive bars out there.	1
Great product, a little bit noisy as it being square is not aerodynamically designed for quiet travel.  I use this with my Thule 400XT Aero Roof Rack Foot Pack with a basket.  I have loaded camping equipment on it when I went camping, I once loaded a 10k btu window AC from Costco and it held it fine.	1
We bought this along with the other parts for my husband's car.  Great shipping speed and great price compared to local shops.	1
These are serious, heavy duty load carrier bars.  They are made of steel with a rubber coating.	1
Bought this for my 2009 Traverse rear window.. It works perfect. Dealership tried to charge me $28 for this same blade... so it was excellent deal and I will be purchasing it again.	1
Worked well on a dodge caravan, appears to be decent quality blade for the price.	1
these wipers work great and are a great price	1
Worked as advertised. My old blades needed changing and this popped in easily and did the job perfectly.	1

Buy two sets. Worth it.	1
Cant beat the cost. Purchased two sets, both work great!	1
These blades seem fine, although I actually use "rain-X" on the windshield and literally never turn on the wipers.	1
works just as good if not better than more expensive ones I bought in the past. I would recommend this and buy it again.	1
I got these blades because they were so cheap and had pretty good reviews. These are great. Easy to install and just as good as any name brand wiper blade I've bought in the past. I'd recommend these to anyone.	1

Good Quality Great Price, unit seem to be a bit more sturdy than the Trico or Anco blades I replaced.  Like the price and quality.	1
This is better than some of the other units I have looked at and used.  I will get more of them.	1
Brother has a 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer, driver side. He got tired of changing his blades out all the time. Since he's giving me rides home, I thought I'd be nice and replace his blades since his last ones were streaking really bad. These do the trick. As long as there is enough water on the windshield, it won't streak. Once you get most of it off it starts to streak but you can't tell once it's dry.	1

OUT WEST, HALF THE YEAR, IT DOESN'T RAIN, THE OTHER HALF YOU NEED REALLY GOOD WIPERS FOR RAIN, SNOW AND ABUSIVE ICE.  THE PROBLEM IS YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR REALLY GOOD WIPERS EXPOSED TO 113 DEGREE HEAT WHEN THERE IS ZERO PERCENT CHANCE OF RAIN FOR THE NEXT THREE MONTHS.  THE HEAT KILLS THE EXPENSIVE WIPERS.  BUT YOU NEED WIPERS TO GET THE DUST AND BUGS OFF THE WINDSHIELD.  SO I USE GOOD WIPERS IN THE WINTER AND TAKE THEM OFF IN THE LATE SPRING. IN THE SUMMER I JUST USE INEXPENSIVE WIPERS; AND THESE ARE THEM.  THEY WORK GREAT TO SPRAY SOME WINDSHIELD FLUID ON TO REMOVE THE BUGS AND DUST.  GREAT VALUE, THANK YOU!	1
I bought this to replace my OEM terminal clamps.  This one did not fit at all on the negative battery terminal of a an Optima red top.  The clamp was way too big (like it was made for the positive terminal).  I sent it back to amazon for a refund.	-1
If you have a SAAB NG, then all i have to say is BUY THIS. it is the best fitting negative terminal I have ever used. Plus it has an extra slot for another ground. It is really solidly built. Great value, I bought 2 one for under hood one for aux battery in trunk.	1
After spending hours working on this POS in 100 degree heat I can tell you that you're better off trying to remove your own appendix than buying this thing.  The problem is that the ring is simply too large to get a secure fit on the negative post of most batteries.  Even screwed in all the way to the point of nearly shearing the screw I can still spin the terminal on the post.  I even tried making modifications to it but to no avail. Don't waste your time or money on this.  You'll just end up with more gray hairs than you started with.  I only wish I could rate it 0 stars.  Actually I think they OWE me stars, that's how bad it is.	-1
Years and years ago I moved the battery in my Saab 900 from the front, crammed in against the turbo, into the trunk. I used an Optima Red Top - probably not the best battery, but what was available at the time in a sealed, non-venting battery. The battery cable was all very high quality braided, silicone insulated stuff but the terminals I've used have been crappy parts store pieces. Inexplicably, I found it IMPOSSIBLE to find battery terminals that fit the negative post of this battery properly - they were always loose, and no matter how hard I clamped down never fit right. A couple years back my Red Top stopped holding a charge, so I replaced it with another Red Top and had the same stupid problem with the negative post! So I tried other terminals... and nothing seemed to work right. This stuff is standardized - so I can only blame cheapo terminals from Autozone. My last negative terminal literally broke in half over the winter, so I replaced it and the positive side (hey, they gotta match) with these DB Link parts. I was not up for spending $80 on solid gold, LED whathaveyou terminals - I just wanted a nice piece that would fit well and last. I think I've found what I was looking for. These terminals installed easily on my battery cable, clamped BOTH posts tightly and completely, and in general appear nicely made. For thirteen bucks each, I think they were a superb choice and I'm looking forward to a long term relationship. In fact, I think I'm gonna order another pair for the other Saab!	1
After 10 years, the negative battery terminal on my 2005 Hyundai Sonata had corroded so much that it began cracking and looked like it could break apart at any time.  I ordered this DB Link BTN1 Negative Battery Terminal as a replacement.  It worked great (looks impressive, too) and allows for a tight fit on the negative post.	1
I like it because I connect all of my wires to it	1
Fell into 2 pieces during install. Cheaply made!	-1
not great for many high gauge connections.  those 2 large holes were taken up by the system wires	1
Does what its supposed to do.  I would buy again.	1
used this for my marine battery and it really organized my connections!	1
These are about the best ones available under $30 ea... If don't need all the accessories, get the military terminals. They're perfect fit on Optima Red & Yellow tops & are Tapered! I hit all these with an electrical stel bit from bottom or taper cutter do fit tight to tapered posts. These still need bushings to fit fight, but almost all do, or grind gap so tighten enough. Out of 4 if these, 1 snapped, side broke before even tightening it hard, but so did the other ones with silly inline too screws. At least the set screws are made so can grip & slide wires deeper & drill to fit if needed.	1
excellent	1
Exceptional quality for the price, it exceeded my expectations over all. These were used in a small solar powered AC/DC utility trailer application.  Thank you very much for a good product, offered at a very reasonable price, with great shipping.  See pics:	1
Perfect fit	1
perfect	1
Great product. Just what I've been looking for.  Make wiring look professional. Easy to organize. I used dielectric grease on the wires. Clamped them down. Allan screws hold tightly in place. I bought more.	1
Nice Gooz!	1
Best idea since Sliced Bread!! Works and easy to use!	1
Adds a little bit of style to your engine bay	1
Quality product and worked well for me	1
Arrived on time and not damaged.	1
ok	1
This is a very well made and very nice looking battery terminal.  On the front, it measures 1 3/4 x 3/4, and the set-screws use metric Allen wrenches of 5mm, 4mm and 3mm for the different gauges of 2, 4 and 8, respectively.  Highly recommended.	1
Good looking. Solid. The holes for the wires are plenty deep so less worrying about stripping too much insulation and whether you can get enough of the conductor under and past the set screw.  Pros: I was actually able to fit #2 welding cable in the lug sized for #4 wire, but these are usually a little bigger than the rated size. Good looking. All allen head set screws ( philips and flathead/regular/common tend to be less able to handle sufficient torque for tightening )  Cons: I had to shave some material from the gap on the battery post clamp with a dremel and a cutoff wheel to get it to close tightly on my battery post	1
Cheaply made, threads stripped easily.	-1
I bought a pair of these, a neg. and a pos. The negative terminal didn't tighten down like the positive one, so I ended up having to fabricate it a bit to get a tight fit. Just be aware if you purchase one.	-1
doesn't work with a "blue board"	-1
WARNING!!! I installed this unit less than a week ago and a trespasser dug it up and opened my gate, by shaking the wand in hand. There are two major flaws with this unit. As stated before it can be easily dug up and opened by hand. The transmitter sticking 2' out of the ground gives away its location. The other major flaw is you can remove the green cap covering the transmitter and read the toggle switched code that is synced to your remote. All you need is a $20 remote along with this code and anyone can come and go as the please. This is not a secure product. I have pulled mine out of the ground and will be returning it.	-1
I followed all instructions and decided to put it 50 feet away and it worked perfectly for two days, then a guest was trying to leave and the gate would not open. I installed new batteries and it worked great a few times then intermittently.... I decided to go with a hardwired sensor which is working at a 100' The sensor deserves zero stars but Amazon service deserves five stars	-1
Beware that it doesnt take a stain. Not sellers fault just a heads up before you start your project	-1
What was delivered is not the tubeless sealant as stated in the product description.  For my purposes, the 'tire sealant' is not appropriate.  Others have written the same thing, I wish I had listened.	-1
I would not advise it was not purchased by ad quality is weak	-1
It works well in a tire if you can get it out of the bottle. Some tire/bike manufacturers put this stuff in their tubes as an added benefit to avoid flats. I would like to know how they get it out of the bottle to do that.	-1
Used with my cordless drill to try and buff my counters and cabinets after applying Jubilee kitchen wax. The pad just made a mess as it was breaking down into dozens of lint balls and this was on a super smooth counter-top.  The Jubilee kitchen wax awesome, just had to buff by hand.	-1
Since this was Crushed to Death when I received It and all I could do was put it in the trash I cannot say how good or bad it is.	-1
Not too good	-1
Bought this to restore the back color to my metal post light.  It did not work at all.  My post light is still very faded.  Guess I'll do what I should have done in the first place:  paint it black.	-1
Tried to clean the aliminum wheels of my silverado but did not work.	-1
Locked hitch when I received it, went to tow camper but it would not unlock... My other one works fine... I would like a replacement as I had to use  a metal saw to remove it so I could leave in the morning.	-1
Did not have a opt. to give it 0 stars. Who would make a lock that is all keyed the same. It would be a great trailer coupler lock if not for that. Had the same lock I had for about 10 years and the old key fit the new lock. All the keys are marked with the 501 key number. so I went to a lock smith to get it rekeyed, he said he could not rekey it. And he didn't believe the locks are the same.	-1
Better  than nothing.  Master name used to mean something.  Guess I am getting old.  Fits very poorly on a very common boat trailer.	-1
Did not fit my hitch well and too easy to forcibly remove.	-1
At first I thought it was secure until one day I was able to wiggle it right off. It fell off the hitch and onto the ground. After I stopped laughing I said what a piece of junk. Junk do not buy! If I can remove this lock imagine how fast a thief can do it.	-1
go with the blue stuff for mc pipes	-1
This device will not protect your trailer sufficiently. Someone broke into ours and stole the keys to the lock. We were traveling the day after I discovered the theft so I looked up the lock on YouTube and quickly found instructions on how to easily pick the lock. With a $1.50 pair of nail clippers I was able to open the lock in 10 minutes. By no means am I a locksmith or lock picking expert.	-1
I was looking for a product that what would renew surface oxidation from the mirror shine on my underhood accessories (supercharger headunit, brackets, intake, etc).  It gave me a cloudy finish and I had to break out the white rouge and repolish. Probably a good product, but not in my case.	-1
Looks great, heavy. I bought mine at WM. Then I happened upon the YouTube video where a guy opens one with everything from a lock pic to a fingernail file. Key? We don't need no stinking key.	-1
Search YouTube for this lock and keyword junk and you'll never want to trust this lock with your valuables!	-1
I locked it onto my trailer, but it would not unlock.  I had to replace the trailer tongue for $29.00.  I would give -1 stars if the system would let me.	-1
Nicely built but unit came without keys that's my reason for one  star  twice  in a  week	-1
Too small.  Read the description carefully as it doesn't fit what they say as "some" sizes.  I had to return it.	-1
I can only speak for the effectiveness of this product on silver plate, so this review relates to using the product on silver plate only. I have tried many products, always looking for something easier,faster. Well I thought I had found it with the simi, however after the first use, I realized it was taking far too much silver off. Plate is fragile and there is only so much of it before you hit the base metal, which means... no more silver. Do not use this product on your silver plate. I use Haggertys and am currently going to try the new silver spray, and a horse hair silver cleaning brush. Will write reviews on those after using them.	-1
Meh.. not impressed.  You REALLY have to make sure everything is tight enough or it you will be able to work it loose. Lock is cheaply made and very easy to pick. I thought it was on tight at one point, but was able to work it loose and cause it to drop out of the hitch. This is mostly for keeping an honest person honest..	-1
I would not fit my wells cargo trailer that takes a 2 and 5/16 ball	-1
Did not fit our Jayco trailer.	-1
As far as how this works, it's quick and easy.  Here's the problem. I actually bought this to replace one for a friend, as I had lost the key to it. So there I was in my driveway with a 25" enclosed trailer with this still locked in place. No key, no problem. I grabbed my sawzall and had this lock off in less than 90 seconds. It's made from cast aluminum, and after cutting through 3/4 of the neck under the ball, a swift kick and it popped right off.  There are better options out there.	-1
Might be a deterrent, one large hit with good size hammer would remove it.	-1
There is nothing apparently wrong with this trailer hitch lock. The construction looks solid and easy to use. The problem is, it just doesn't come close to fitting our 2 5/16" Airstream hitch. Even a call to the manufacturer took two days to get measurements, and we received measurements for a different part of the lock than those which we requested. With a 200 mile roundtrip drive to our travel trailer, this was a considerable inconvenience. The listing should be revised to include the maximum opening between the end of the locking shaft and the nearest edge of the ball--this measurement would let you determine in advance whether it would fit.  We started by purchasing MasterLock's "universal" Hitch lock, which was supposed to handle "most" 2 5/16" hitches, but was way too small. With no measurements listed for either the "universal" or for the 378 2 5/16" dedicated hitch lock, we extrapolated from the photos that the gap between the upright shaft retainer and the edge of the ball was significantly greater on the 378, so gave it a try. But they changed the construction to put a pin that limits the retraction of the shaft on the larger unit, so the effective opening looks to be exactly the same. Again, listing of this measurement for both hitches would save a lot of headache for consumers and all the companies involved, including shipping costs.	-1
Goldenrod Flex Spout Oiler, 16 Oz  It's not difficult to find new hand tools of high quality and better design than similar tools of decades past.  With pump oilers, that's not the case.  That is, while this oiler works OK, it's clearly inferior to the Eagle No. 28 pump oiler that my father-in-law bought 65 years ago and used for decades as a fire engine mechanic.  (See Customer Images.)  Web sites like ebay occasionally have old Eagle pump oilers - that might be worth a look...  Here's a comparison:  - The steel pump lever on the Eagle is twice as thick as the flimsy Goldenrod lever (.099" versus .049")  - Flick your finger on the empty Eagle can and it goes "thunk".  The Goldenrod can's response is a "tink", as it's much thinner.  - The Eagle has a better designed (long pointed) spout to precisely get at the thing to oil.  - The Eagle pump is larger and more substantial than the Goldenrod pump.  - The nut holding the spout to the can is puny on the Goldenrod and robust on the Eagle.  - The Eagle handle is better designed, and it's lasted 60 years!  - The Eagle has product information painted on the can that is still perfect after 6 decades.  The Goldenrod has a cheap  stick-on label.  Very few companies make pump oilers today and none of the half dozen stores in my area where I looked, carry a decent one.  I was unable to find anything better than this Goldenrod from any Internet vendor, regardless of price.  Seems that if you want a pint-sized pump oiler, the Goldenrod models are as good as any available, and that's disappointing.  It's just a shame that the Dutton Lainson Company (who now own the Goldenrod line) have succumbed to the "make it cheap" mentality.  They fail to realize that many customers would pay more for a quality product.  Web sites like ebay occasionally have old Eagle pump oilers - that might be worth a look...	-1
IT should not move.  But it does. Which makes it virtually useless for the intended purpose.  I suppose there are workarounds.  But then it is no longer useful as a quick way to get your car up to change the oil.  Also, it's about four inches too low, unless you're a skinny guy or gal.  For the money, you're better off paying a little more and getting some good jackstands and a nice little hydraulic jack.	-1
smells awful, but works well.  Not something I'd want to smell in my car unfortunately.  Very chemical smell.	-1
This protectant doesn't seem to work any better than the newer version of Armor All.  It really smells strange.  I used it once and never again.  I can't seem to give it away.  Trashed it.	-1
$11.77 for 16.9 ounces ... too expensive ! go spend $1.00 dollar for "Totally Awesome" @ dollar store. $11.77 for 16.9 ounces ... too expensive ! go spend $1.00 dollar for "Totally Awesome" @ dollar store	-1
You need to be able to spray your evaporator core. Which is not easily accessible for my 2014 Jeep Cherokee.  I could access the blower fan but after spraying that excessively I didn't notice any long term removal of the musky smell.  I did replace the cabin air filter at the same time.  The drain plug also had some kind of filter on it, so I was unable to leverage that access point, straw would not go in.	-1
Did not foam up as it should've. I thought it worked well at first but it actually didn't do a good job after all. Has an awful choking chemical smell initially. Musty smell was not completely removed despite applying liberally and directly onto evaporator core. The hose attachment is useful. Within a couple months the mold smell was awful and I ended up using a bottle of lysol air purifier which was like a third of the price and actually did a better job at removing the mustiness.	-1
This one differ from older foaming spray.  Doesn't foam up like the older smaller can it use to come in, more like Lysol spray.  For my car it's ineffective at clearing up moldy AC parts.	-1
Followed the instructions going through the blower assembly straight to the evaporator unit.  Emptied the whole can.  The product seemed to work as I had a lemon smell for about two days. Then the musty smell returned.  Disappointed!	-1
I followed the directions & it worked okay for a few days but the musty smell returned to the a/c. It seemed to mask the smell more than eliminate it. I then tried spraying unscented Lysol in to the fresh-air intake under the windshield & that worked great. The smell has been gone for several months now so I'd call that a cure.	-1
Smell was decreased a little bit but still there. My clothes still smell mold after driving to work. I followed instructions. Be careful because when you remove the little tube that's attached to the bottle with box tape (caveman style) it will remove the instructions with it!  Definitely overpriced.	-1
Bought two cans of this stuff.  First used half before and half after the evap.  Still stunk!  Tried second car but it too did not work.	-1
Tailpipe came in 4 pieces with no clamps to connect them. The pipe did not match the original pipe in any way. The bend that goes over the axle was several inches too high, it will hit the underside of the truck. Each end of the pipe was way too long. I would have to cut several inches off each end. In conclusion this pipe was the correct general shape but would not fit without major alterations. I sent it back. End of story!	-1
Had to modify thread to work on Hollywood bike rack. Does not fit Hollywood bike rack.	-1
The bolt on this is too long for a lot of applications.  I tried using this for an extension on two different hitch mounted bike racks.  The bolt goes through the extension great, but leave over an inch of unexposed bolt before the lock.  The whole thing is as secure as someone taking a hacksaw to a 1/4" bolt.  Other hitch locks I've used close the distance to the carrier enough that it would be very difficult to get any sort of cutting device on there.  The lock is pretty flimsy as well.  This is pretty much just to prevent a quick snatch and grab.	-1
Seems cheap. Finish is not durable. Plastic is brittle. Keys feel hollow. Does not fit my 2" x 2" receiver well. Rattles and allows excessive forward/ backward motion of the hitch. Apparently you must have a special configuration for this hitch-lock to screw into the receiver. Amazon is charging me $7.00 to return it. I'm not happy.	-1
I have used PIAA wipers for years.  They are great when you first install them.  However within three months they start to streak badly.  I guess I thought this happened with all wiper blades until I bought some Goodyear blades that were on sale for my wife's car.  A year down the road her blades are still great while my second set of PIAA's are already worn out.  Additionally although we drive about the same number of miles, my car (with the PIAAs) is garaged and hers (with the Goodyears) is parked outside.	-1
For some reason I decided to give PIAA blades another try. After ten weeks of use on our Outback, both blades  need replacing due to multiple heavy streaks and not wiping the windshield clear. We live in a rainy area but no snow, ice, or frost that would worsen wear and the car is parked in a garage.	-1
I have had this product before and had no problems. I recently purchased two to replace my previous ones. One package came open on the end, and slightly sticking out of the package. I inspected the product and it appeared to be ok, so I installed it. After the first use, the blades were not cleaning the window fully, leaving an inch stripe along the top of the blade. I attempted to clean the blade and it actually got worse. Now I have a larger streak, about 3 inches. Upon inspecting the blade, the rubber doesn't appear to be straight any longer.  I was able to tolerate the 1" streak, but can't the 3". Unfortunately, since  I was tolerating it,  I neglected to return these in a timely fashion and now am stuck with junk. I will be replacing the drivers side with a Bosch.	-1
..prepare to be disappointed.  I had purchased half a dozen pairs of Super Sporza wipers over the years for different vehicles and they were flawless, sometimes for as long as 6-7 years before they needed a refill blade.  These however never properly seemed to clear the windshield, even after a fresh cleaning, with our without the silicone treatment.  They have already started tearing and it has not yet been a year.  Going to try something else.	-1
Used the PIAA blades on another car and they were great so ordered them for my 2006 BMW 325 xi. They did not fit. Contacted PIAA and they said I needed part no. 97048. Contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement, except it was the same thing, so I returned both.	-1
Yaris has a 29 inch wiper on front.	-1
I also got a 24 and 22 inch blade, and the 22 inch is not correct width.  I tried to use them, and now breaking since do not fit correctly, or the 22 inch length one is.  Now must buy again just a few months later.	-1
Silicone blades are supposed to last for years that is why they are more expensive than other blades. I maintained them for the past year, cleaning them regularly and they are worn out and streaking my windshield. I am very disappointed.	-1
Delivered 24" Blade. The item requested was filler blade and I will not pay for it.	-1
speed clips were not in the box very annoying to have to spend more money on what appears to be an over priced product....quality of the net is okay but the cheaper one from Bully is probably a better value....	-1
I was enthused when I first saw this product. I strive to keep safety items in the car and house, so this one seemed perfect. A flare that runs on batteries? I could get a bunch of these for my car and for my boyfriend's car, and make sure we're always safe!  I popped in the batteries and turned it on. This is a flare? I took it outside. I tried it at night. There NO way a car coming down a highway is going to see that tiny light and know anything is going on. A person relying on this is setting themselves up for a catastrophic disaster. Having a high-powered flare isn't just a casual "nice to have" thing. It can literally be the difference between staying alive and having a sleepy trucker barrel into the car, demolishing it.  The light isn't even strong enough to read by in the car. There's nothing I would use this for. And the fact that they market it as a flare safety device concerns me greatly. I worry that someone will fall for that claim, try to use it as a flare, and end up with serious injuries - or worse.  I highly recommend that people buy REAL FLARES for their cars and check on them every year or two. Have flashlights. Check the batteries. Safety is important.  Definitely do not buy this product.	-1
I thought this was surprisingly bright for a little LED, but I still don't think it's enough to stand out among all the other lights found around roads.  The whole things glows slightly when it's on, but the beam where it's actually bright is extremely narrow, to the point where you'd have to be actively aiming it at people to get their attention. Many flashlights at the same price point would be much more effective, as well as being useful for other tasks.	-1
I really wanted to like this product. I travel alone at night often and was hoping this would provide a bit of security for me in case of an emergency. As others have noted, the light is not especially strong. It seems about the same as a bicycle light might be. That's fine on a side street where traffic is at a minimum and moving slow but nowhere near what you need on a busier road or highway. Even in those circumstances, the light would mearly catch a driver's attention out of curiosity rather than a sign of danger. If you had several of these - say a dozen - and were able to spread them out well ahead of any approaching traffic to your vehicle, these might be fine. But only one or two will not make a difference in your level of safety. As for a map light, that seems to be ok but the red is pretty awkward to read by. I will keep it in my car but will need to look elsewhere to find something that will make me feel more secure should I break down and need a flare.	-1
When I received Heininger 1020 CommuteMate "Flameless Flare", I had high hopes... real flares can be dangerous, messy, and difficult to use. I thought this might be the perfect thing to place in my old truck in the event I had a break-down. I also thought it might be good to take on my ATV trips in the event I break down on the trail and need to leave some kind of visible marker on my ATV along the trail.  Sad to say, I was rather disappointed. The flare is powered by two AAA batteries and a single red LED. In the daylight, the light output from the flare is barely noticeable. At night-time it is slightly more noticeable and might serve as a marker light on your car to someone who is paying attention. Or, if you were using it on a dark trail, it might be visible from a short distance. But it really is no brighter than the keyfob LEDs that are intended to assist in unlocking a door. The light is also uni-directional (only coming from one side of the flare), so careful positioning would be a must. I think it would be tricky to use as a map light, too, since maps often contain red text which would be difficult to see with a red light.  That said, I will not go as far as to claim that the product mis-represents itself. It is re-usable, and it could function as a secondary warning marker. It is not flammable, and it came with batteries which seems rare these days. The idea for the magnetic end that sticks to the sides of vehicles would be good, if most vehicles were made of steel. But many these days are made of fiberglass or aluminum and thus the magnet serves a limited purpose.  If this product were marketed as a sort of a secondary marker light, it might be acceptable. One could place it on top of their car or on the trunk as a "failsafe". After all, the more lights the better. However, the idea that it would serve as a "flare" is just not correct. If I were changing a tire along the side of a busy road, for example, I would have NO faith that anyone would see or notice this light in their headlights. I would expect something MUCH brighter for an application such as that, and given that expectation this product unfortunately fell short of both its name and purpose.	-1
When I ordered this item I expected it to be comparable in performance to an old style flare.  If not that bright, I thought perhaps it could be used to mark an obstacle on the side of the road- perhaps a downed tree or abandoned vehicle.  I was very disappointed.  The light is not bright enough to use effectively as a road flare.  It might be bright enough to use on a person riding a bicycle, but I wouldn't think so.  On the positive side, the battery life is exceptional.  I left this one on for over twentyfour hours and it was still performing.  The plastic case has a magnet on one end, and a place for a tether on the other end.  This means it is easy to use- you can stick it on a car or hang it from a lanyard.  Although the case is thin, it is strong enough and its light.  On the negative side is performance.  If you are looking for a light to use in safety sensitive area- as a flare or warning, this product is not there.  LEDs have come a long way and there are some good products, they cost more, of course, but you get what you pay for.    T	-1
The CommuteMate Flameless Flare is not good replacement for regular flares.  If you plan to go somewhere that might require a flare for emergency use, do not rely on the CommuteMate.  It simply doesn't get bright enough to use in emergency situations.  The flare is made of shiny plastic.  Headlights could easily reflect off of the plastic and prevent people from noticing the blinking red light.  The flare itself seems feeble and I can imagine it breaking somewhat easily.  It's not rugged.  I also tried taking the batteries out after my initial test and the second battery become stuck inside.  I tried hitting it to get the battery out to no avail.  I was worried that if I hit it too hard, it would break, so I just put the second battery back in.  The idea of a flare that runs on batteries and can last up to 500 hours sounds attractive, but in this case it's not useful.	-1
This is a little red flashlight, period.  Yes, the red light is bright, and yes, it blinks if you set it to do so.  But this would NEVER take the place of a real flare under any circumstances. DO NOT buy this to replace the flares you should carry in your car emergency kit!!!!  Most flashlights have the light beam coming straight out of the end of the tube.  This one has the light coming off the side, like a beacon or lighthouse.  It can ONLY be viewed from straight on!  While a flare puts out intense light in all directions (like a sparkler) this little flashlight only puts out light in one direction - the direction you have faced the beam.  DO NOT BUY, except as a toy, or as a hiking signal light - I have given it two stars for it being at least that useful.  Flare?  No way.	-1
When I saw this product I hoped it would actually be a good alternative to carrying conventional roadside flares. It won't do the job. The emergency flashing light cannot be seen for any distance that would be practical to use at night along side an Interstate highway with a broken down auto. If, as the manufacturer claims, the light is visable at 1,000 ft. it must have been tested under some really optimal conditions. I have personally had to use flares at night at an accident scene along an Interstate highway and even with such bright light it was more than a bit "iffy" at times when oncoming traffic apparently did not see the flares in time to slow down. To attempt to use this in place of flares is, in my opinion, dangerous and is irresponsibe for the manufacturer to recommend such a practice.  Buyer Beware.	-1
Pros: battery driven; flashing or steady light; flameless flare; can be used as a map light; reusable. Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision.  Cons: Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft, but this is only possible within a few degrees of view. One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation, but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight. Consequently, the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light. It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional. This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles.  If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle, buy the real thing. If you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver, or to see where you're walking without seriously degrading your night vision, this red light will do that well.	-1
Item description is not what it is. This leads you to believe you are buying a 6000# towing extension, but read the fine print - "NOT FOR TOWING" This is nothing but a misrepresented bike rack extension ONLY.. Do not be fooled by the description and waste your time as well.	-1
Did NOT fit my 2009 Honda Civic LX.  Way too narrow, and did not fit the wiper blade at all.	-1
Piece of junk. Didn't last a week. The first hot M240 Bravo I threw in the back of the truck cut through it like a hot knife through butter.	-1
Car: 2014 civic lx  These wipers fell off constantly. There is no real locking mechanism (like the oem ones) so when using these PIAA wipers at full speed, they become loose and fall off. This was extremely dangerous and happened multiple times when I was on the highway.  I believe the adapter (c1) is not a perfect fit which caused this issue. Problems only arose after around 4 weeks of use. I had purchased the 26" and 22" from separate vendors so I do not believe this was a manufacturing issue.  Be careful if you own a 2013, 2014, or 2015 (9th gen) Civic Sedan.	-1
Cheaply made for the price. Bosh beats these at a lot lower cost	-1
awesome at first but the thing came apart with nothing in the bed of the truck within 2 weeks.	-1
We bought the Lund Folding Cargo Carrier in December 2009.  We took it on several trips carrying mostly luggage but really wanted it to attach to the back of our travel trailer.  We took it on a long camping trip (2 months) during the summer of 2010.  It did not fare well.  Midway through the trip, we noticed several bolts and nuts were working lose.  I had properly tightened them but we replaced both the nuts and the washers.  That problem solved.  By the end of the trip, the hitch shank began to bend.  It was like it was moving up and down within the hitch mount.  The shank metal appears to be too thin for the minimal amount of weight on the carrier.  At no point had the weight on the carrier exceeded 250 lbs.  Overall not a good long term investment.	-1
One thing to remember with this step, is to not to forger to take it off when done !!	-1
Maybe I received a defective product, for the manufacturer's sake, I hope so. I attempted to install this in my 2007 Tundra, standard sized pickup bed, and it was so rickety that it barely held its own weight. I re-read the instructions, it's a straightforward process, did everything exactly as directed, and with only a slight side load it repeatedly collapsed. Over-ratcheting (compressing the bar tightly against the bed) is ineffective. If you tighten it too much, it'll simply bow and collapse. I suspect this is more of a design issue than a manufacturing issue. I could have modified it but it's easier to use Amazon's excellent return process and find a better solution. Perhaps all the great reviews on this product are from UPS investors. This thing is bulky and shipping it two ways (once from Amazon, once from disgruntled buyers) must be a profit center for UPS!	-1
Did not fit my GMC Sierra even though the Amazon Garage claimed it would. 3rd time the "Garage" info has been inaccurate.  **Update** None of the adapters that came in the package would fit the wiper arms on my truck, even though they are standard. What did fit are these ACDelco wipers&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ACDelco-8-9022-Wiper-Blade/dp/B004JAZZI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ACDelco 8-9022 Wiper Blade</a>. This is on a 2009 GMC Sierra	-1
Long enough to help strap down the bike and tires when transporting on a bike rack. I thought they were going to be too long but I was wrong. Very useful.  Long Term Update:  I like the straps but they have a weak point at the heat weld which causes them to tear very easily. I have gone through the bag and down to the last two straps in less than 6 months.  I can not recommend the product due to the tearing at the heat weld. The manufacturer should be aware of this problem and fix.  Not Recommended!	-1
Put this on a 1999 F-250 Super duty,  Didn't really fit right.  Netting is too wide and not easily tightened even with quick release clips that I also purchased.  Looks better than the rusty tailgate so it is a slight improvement.  Sags after being on the road.  I personally did not like it but maybe others have had no issues.	-1
Doesn't fit my 2" receiver. Way too tight. I will have to grind it on all four sides to make it fit.	-1
Arrived on time but was missing the key part to attach to the vehicle.  The missing part was C1  So the wiper is useless!	-1
far too loose for my comfort	-1
Same yourself the troubles, this item is pure "Junk".  It was "Poorly" made and did not hold any amount of tension to keep in place with "No Load" or cargo resting upon it.  This is a fine example of "Crap" to be expected from "Made in China".  I bought a different one at PepBoys that I could put my hands on and inspect with a level of "Scrutiny".  This unit turned out to be a better made unit, not much more, but "Better" nevertheless...  I did not want to be "Hassled" with returning it, so I gave it way to neighbor. Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere for a cargo bar.  This one is only fit for the "Barrel"...	-1
so, the buckles are not replaceable.  They are sown into the sides (top and bottom) of the net.  If you pull even the slightest bit off center, the buckles are not durable and will break.  This is cheap, unmitigated plastic and brittle at that.  Not hard to install - took me less than an hour.  But now I've got a heap of junk and four holes on the inside bed of my truck.	-1
The ratcheting mechanism doesn't work very well, most of the time it just slips out of place (no bed liner in my truck). I have to really get mean with it to get one last click and hope it holds. Just not designed with fine enough control, the ratchet spacing is too far apart.	-1
Some where in the description of this item it needs to say NOT TO BE USED FOR TOWING, bike rack use only. Since I do not have a bike rack I now have a useless piece of iron since the cost of sending it back does not make it worth shipping back.  Defined search does not give you what you ask for but every thing that can be associated with it and in this instance I did not catch it. If you want a bike rack extension here is one!	-1
Missing parts,not good fit on large tires.	-1
I ordered two of these for my long bed Ford.  The first one would not stay tight.  It's like the teeth would slip if you cranked it hard enough for it to hold in place.  The second one didn't want to ratchet at all once I got it snug against both sides.  Finally I managed to get it to go and lock it down.  Then I decided I wanted to move it a bit higher.  Now when I went to put it in free slide mode to loosen it it wouldn't budge.  I had to kick it until it bent enough to pull it loose.  Great concept but the ratcheting mechanism on this particular one sucks.  Find a different one.  I am once I return this scrap metal to Amazon.	-1
This is for maybe a light bike rack. It is not rated for any weight at all. I sent it back an bought a real extension. Cheaply made low quality I would not even trust it with one bike on a rack.	-1
While it does clear part of the windshield properly, about one quarter of the end of the blade does not sit flush to the windshield, and does not wipe a portion of it.  For this price, I expected better.  My last two silicone blades from other manufacturers and nearly the identical frame had no issues whatsoever in contacting the windshield properly.  Avoid this brand.	-1
Honestly, it's worthless to me. It is made of flimsy square tube and the locking bolt is barely long enough for three cranks. It's not a good product for the price. I ended up going to U-Haul and getting a heavier, cheaper, better version.	-1
squeaks after 6 months.	-1
very misleading for us speed readers,,,,looks like a 6000lb extension....NOT...for bike racks only.  You can see that in the product discription...NAME IT SOMETHING ELSE AND DROP THE 6000 from the product name.	-1
These were supposed to fit my 1997 ford F-250 crew cab but are too long.  The wiper goes off the window on the top for both blades.  I should have checked after I installed them.	-1
Note: This is NOT for towing--this is ONLY for use with a bicycle rack!!!  No where in the item description does it mention that this is NOT FOR TOWING, and yet when I opened the box from Amazon, it's printed right on the Heininger box--"Not to be used for towing."  I bought this because I needed a hitch extension--NOT a bike rack mounting extension!! What a waste of time and money............	-1
Advertised to fit 2004 Cobra wiper blades - does not fit. Factory blade requires 8mm rectangle design, these are 6mm rectangle design.	-1
Did not fit. As a result it was returned.	-1
Does not fit vehicle as described	-1
DOES NOT FIT ( Sienna minivan 2015) VEHICLES WITH LIMITED OVER THE TIRE WHEEL WELL CLEARANCE.  The rear support arm is unable to move far enough forward to clear the top of the tire.  There is a strapped version on the market that will work, but I am uncertain how durable the product is.  We will instead purchase a 15 inch collapsible step.	-1
good on my rear tires but no good on the fronts	-1
PIAA 94065 Silicone Wiper Blade Refill, 26" Purchased for 2011 Hyundai Sonata to keep original wiper arm and replace only the rubber. Didn't fit well, too narrow but I made it work - width is a huge issue when doing this kind of replacement. I wouldn't knock it for this though, it's meant to replace their own product. However the performance lasted less than 6 months - spring to fall. Not even winter. Will try something else next time, hopefully find the magic one for this car.	-1
Bought two, one still going, the other never wiped right and eventually replaced it. So So -- no matter what they're made of.	-1
This insert appeared to be 24" long instead of 26". Also, metal inserts/springs don't look like original ones which make me think that the whole product is a fake. Unfortunately, I didn't check it right away as I had no time and had a trust in Amazon based on previous purchases of the similar items. Now it's too late to return. Amazon, it looks like you missed the right direction lately (lousy packaging, defective items).	-1
Did NOT fit my 2009 Honda Civic LX.  Way too narrow, and did not fit the wiper blade at all.	-1
These do not fit the 1989 Chevy Blazer as stated. They are the correct length; however, they do not come with the correct adapter to fit onto the wiper arm of an '89 Chevy Blazer.	-1
These wiper inserts do not fit a 2008 Acura TSX stock wiper body.  The Amazon compatibility search said they did.  Both he rubber channel on the insert and the metal bars are too wide for the channel in the stock wiper body.  Stick to Acura OEM.  The seemed to be good quality and would probably work in a wiper they fit, but there was no way they were going in without twisting or damaging the rubber.  The OEM slide in smoothly and fit perfectly.	-1
Developed a wear hole where it rubbed against a rack bar and flapped in the wind. Straps work good, zipper worked good, fabric wore through.	-1
Waste your money	-1
Not practical for Wranglers	-1
WIpers are ok, but not worth the cost.  They work well in heavy rain, but still streak a bit in a drizzle.  You're better off with SilBlades.	-1

I ordered this item to load things in my SUV roof rack, but it got me nowhere close. At the maximum height, it's still only a little more than half way up the tire; When set at this height, the step no longer fits in the bag, and the screw/wing nut assembly is not very quick to change.  The bag, aside from being too small, also has cheap zippers and the stitching ripped within a day of using the product.  Good idea, poor execution... NOT RECOMMENDED!	-1
Looked like a great idea but I've used it and it feels a bit unsteady.  Also it does not get me away from truck bed enough to really help. Better to stand on a cooler or tire	-1
The first road trip we took with his product ended up ruining it. If I had to do it all over again, I would have put down some sort of protective materiel inside the bag, but under my luggage. The hardware (wheels and handles) shredded the waterproof materiel; the bag then leaked and ended up in the garbage. A redesign is in order with some kind of firm materiel on the inside bottom	-1
Cheap and wrong size for my 2013 370z.	-1
Bag itself is a good quality piece. But we tried to use it without roof rails...if you have roof rails to tie it down I'm sure it would be fine.  If you don't have them and you try to secure with supplied clips and door method it just doesn't seem secure enough. We ended up shoving it into the car half way into our trip.	-1
this was one of those items that looked like a good idea, but didn't live up to the promise. item is quite well built and certainly does what it says it will do. but for me the issue was simply the hassle of taking it out, opening it up and attaching it, removing after use, folding it back up and storing it when done. it is quite heavy and cumbersome and all that takes more time and energy than what it's worth. it's much easier to just step on the tire, or use the step on the back bumper.	-1
Honestly not that good. I expected it to work better since it's so expensive but it works just as well as a $10 blade you buy at autozone.	-1
Nothing really special about this wiper as I had hoped after reading all the reviews.....It's just another wiper and works OK. I wish I could have posted a 5 star review but that is not the case. After only a few months, this wiper needs replacing and I surely will NOT replace it with the same wiper!	-1
I like the wiper blades themselves in that when the stay together, they clean the windshield and last a long time.  I like that these are replaceable and I can just slide in a new blade without replacing the entire arm.  I hate the the blades don't stay together.  The blades are made with two metal strips that run the length of the blade to give it stiffness. These strips are set into a channel in the rubber/silicone (whatever the soft part is) part of the blade.  Unfortunately, the metal strips keep coming out of the channel with the result that the blade moves in the arm and allows the arm to come in contact with my windshield.  It is easy to put the strips back in the channels, but who wants to do that in the dark, in a snow storm?	-1
Strapped it to the top of our GMC Acadia using the pre installed straps, secured around the roof bars. We had one large suitcase, one small suitcase, a baby pack and play and a few more small items. The bag had a LOT of space, i was impressed! The bag had an integrated pad on the bottom to help protect your vehicle roof which was nice.  On the first part of our trip (480miles) through non-stop rain the bag did okay. No slipping or sliding, had noticeable wind noise but not unbearable. However, when we got to our destination everything in the bag was damp, some items where wet. I even made sure to rotate the bag to where the zipper was on the sides and rear, water still made its way in.  The bag tore on our journey home, going highway speeds (70MPH) and packaged the same as the trip there. It tore on the front part of the bag near the linch strap, ripped all the way across. Would not buy this bag again.	-1
arrived on time but looked as if it had been towed behind a vehicle, not strapped to the top....was already a repackaged item - so QC fell down on this one....am going to try another brand	-1
Updated post Aug 2015:  drop down to 2 stars and would drop it more but it has done well for about 3 trips a year since 2011. However, we just took a trip to Montana. I had our sleeping bags inside. It was mounted tightly to our Jeep Compass.  Somewhere between Ft Collins Co and Wheatland WY the bag blew off without a sound or trace. We had all of our family's sleeping bags and dress clothes for a wedding inside!!! Not happy about it at all.  Old post: I have only used this item for one camping trip, however it did what it was supposed to.  I also purchased "Highland 2005200 48" Black Universal Car Top Bar Carrier" (roof rack) because it was not clear if I needed them for my 99 Chevy Malibu.  The bag comes with straps to secure it to the roof and I didn't need the rack.  Edited: I have used this bag with no issues for two camping seasons now.  The only thing I found was during a very serious downpour on the highway I found the sleeping bags were damp (not soaked) around the zipper area.  I sprayed the bag down with a full can of camp dry type product, especially the seam around the zipper.  I have been in small rains and it does just fine, I have not had the down pour experience again though, thankfully.  For the price, this is one of my favorite camping devices I have, it saves a ton of room in the car! I fit every sleeping bag we have 6 total, the sleep mats, rolled up air mattress (compact sized one anyway), and usually our family clothes bag.	-1
I used these for a few months and they never stopped streaking. Went back to OEM blades.	-1
These worked great for about a year, probably the best wipers I've ever had. They started falling apart, though, after about a year. Maybe that's ok with some people but at this price I expected more.	-1
I thought these were a great find, at first. But they wear out rather quickly. So beware. Plan on replacing them often.	-1

These wipers while being 22 inches long will not work on a Cadillac Escalade. The Escalade uses a "snap" replacement blade type  where you have to compress the clips for installation and removal. These PIAA replacement blades are designed for the "C" type adapter. It only contains adapters for the "C" type.	-1
Extremely low quality. Became all tarnished and began rusting in only ONE WEEK!!! Seriously!!! Must be very low amount of chrome and mostly steel which makes it a very poor grade of stainless steel. DO NOT PURCHASE.	-1
2001 Honda Civic  I bought the 19" and 21" for my baby, and the 19" works fine, however the 21 has just been trouble. The bottom half of the wiper skids across my windshield and is fairly loud in doing so. I've tried bending my car's wiper arm in various directions to possibly alleviate this problem as several mechanics suggested I try but it didn't make it any better.	-1
i love these wiper blades they glide across my windshield without a problem even when they are bone dry, i would and plan on buying these again  *Revised* this is the worst set of windshield wipers i have ever had. the 1st month they were amazing then it seamed over night they cants wipe anything away without leaving huge streaks. it gets so bad that it makes it hard to see. i have gotten cheap $10 wipers that have done a better job then these...	-1
I was unaware that one would need to apply silicon to the winshield first for the wipers to work. I do not believe that I had read anything about this in the product description. The wipers are not special at all as I had first believed. I missed this one, so of course it is my own fault for not reading up on the product more.	-1
It is probably my fault but I had no idea that there was a silicon application that was needed to applied to windshield prior to using, this to me was very disappointing.	-1
The price alone makes me feel cheated, but seeing the product makes me regret this purchase.  I bought four of the PIAA Super Silicone wiper blade systems to replace factory wipers on a 2004 Nissan Maxima and 2010 Kia Forte. The PIAA wiper frames are virtually identical to the factory OEM parts on both cars, and the wiper blades are merely graphite-coated parts identical to Bosch, Anco, and Trico refill equivalents.  Before I purchased the PIAA Super Silicone wiper blades, I was given the impression that both the wiper frame and wiper blade were unique.  They're not.  They're exactly the same as every other standard-width (0.32" / 8.1mm) blade on the market.  What makes them so special?  Aside from a tiny packet containing a wiper with silicon solution in rubbing alcohol for the windshield... nothing is special about these wipers.  Summary: unless you need to replace the wiper frame, keep what you've got and just get replacement wiper blade refills.  Graphite-coated blades are nice, but the graphite only lasts for the first few times you use it.  Teflon-coated blades may be a better, and more affordable, wiper blade solution.	-1

I ordered these last summer and put them away for a rainy day. Today I see that I have the correct package and part number, however the refill blade inside the very short It is not 20.5 inches in lenght! If it was actually 21 inches it would have worked. Epic Fail And now too late to get a refund.	-1
They didn't fit my vehicle like the site said they would and they seemed pretty cheap anyway quality wise.	-1
I purchased both front and rear PIAA wipers for my Porsche Carrera C4S. Huge mistake. They came apart at the tip and scratched my windshield so now I will have to replace a very expensive windshield and they have refused to help after repeated requests and pictures sent.  The first one came apart within minutes of first use and the second shortly threafter while I was driving in heavy rain on a crowded muli-lane freeway.   I sent many pictures and messages to PIAA and have been brushed off or ignored by the Company. I will never potentially endanger my life or actually destroy my property with their products again.	-1
I bought these blades for my 2007 Honda CRV. The 26 " blade does not fit the contour of the windsheild. I returned to Amazon and bought rainx blades from Walmart - these blades work fine.	-1
it works, but no more than cheap ones. A cheap blade and rainx would have same effect. After one month blade is already streaking windshield.	-1
The blade probably works fine, but they are advertised here and on PIAA's web site as fitting the driver side on a Prius including our 2007, but when it arrived- no good.  It included a few different connectors, but not the one for the driver's side.  I called PIAA and told them, they looked it up and found it was incorrect in their book.  I sent them a picture of the pointed 6mm connector and they said they did not have anything like it.  I thought I would just cut my loss and remove the new blade from the new frame and insert it in the old OEM frame, but as it turns out the PIAA is 24" as advertised, but the Prius driver side is actually 25.5" so even if it came with the proper adaptor, it still would have been 1.5" too small.	-1
These would work fine if they were curved, but instead they are perfectly straight and won't make good contact across the windshield.	-1
Be careful. This is indeed a 24" blade, but what is not specified is the width. This is 5/16" (8mm) wide. My car uses a 24" 1/4" (6mm) blade so it didn't fit and is why I gave it a 2 stars (the width is no where to be found in the description or details). PIAA are good blades, just make sure you buy one that fits in both dimensions.	-1
THIS BLADE DOES NOT FIT THE ACURA RL 2006.  THE CORRECT BLADE TO PURCHASE IS PIAA 94070 Silicone Wiper Blade Refill, 28".  THE PIAA 94070 Silicone Wiper Blade Refill, 28" IS AN EXCELLENT BLADE, LOVE IT!	-1
This place did not label product properly.  This unit is 6mm or 1/4 in width according to box when I received it.  I received 8mm 5/16 in. Now I have to return. And this place won't give my full refund.	-1
Worked awesome as refills for my VW MKV Rabbit/Golf but then pretty much died a fast death after 3-4 months and I live in Seattle where temps are mild and it was when we really didn't have much rain (shocker).  Since then have gone back to the dealership refills.  Oh well...	-1
It's TOO SHORT.  Max measurement from receiver to back end of step is only 21.5", and not the 23.5" as described.  PLUS - unfortunately, I assumed they would measure from the receiver to the front side of the step, since that it what matters.  When down, the end/top of the tailgate on 2013 F150 is about 19.5" our from the receiver.  The step would need to be at least that far out.  A little more would be better.  This step is mostly under the gate.  Makes it less than optimal to use getting up, and completely useless for getting down. If your gate size and/or receiver placement gives you 19" or less from receiver to end of gate, ten this will probably work for you. It seems well built.  Aside from the issue with the length of the step bar, it looks like a good design. Heininger website shows a Truckstep XL, #4037, "coming soon", with no spec's given.	-1
The step bottoms out on the slightest incline. During my first use it bottomed out and pulled the plastic part of the step off. I haven't used the step since.	-1
these are OK, but they are cheap and quality is poor.  I dropped one of the hammers and the head broke off, not the handle, but the iron head !  The set I received looked as though they had already been used.  Even the case was shattered when it arrived.  Think next time I would look for a better quality set of body hammers.	-1
Poor quality! Metal is malformed and poorly engineered . Hammers are too lightweight for proper blow strength .	-1
First time I used the set the handle on the hammer broke.  The company did refund part of my money which I thought would go towards the purchase of a new handle.  Unfortunately as I tried to drill out the old handle the head of the hammer split and fell apart.  Not what I had bargained for!	-1
the box came broken (not a deal breaker review does not reflect opinion of case) opened box to find that the curved dolly was missing and two of the hammers were exactly the same	-1
it is worthless	-1
These wiper inserts do not fit a 2008 Acura TSX stock wiper body.  The Amazon compatibility search said they did.  Both he rubber channel on the insert and the metal bars are too wide for the channel in the stock wiper body.  Stick to Acura OEM.  The seemed to be good quality and would probably work in a wiper they fit, but there was no way they were going in without twisting or damaging the rubber.  The OEM slide in smoothly and fit perfectly.	-1
Great product even though I ordered 4 & only received 1. Really wish I had them all	-1
cheap switches. High resistance and WAY too small screw connectors.  Don't buy these. They are a cheap chinese imitation of good switches.	-1
Switch is rated 20 amps @120vac. I put a constant resistive load on it of 14 amps to run a space heater. A resistive load is easier on contacts than inductive load.  Switch went bad in one week. Pitiful. Sure, I could return it, but it's not worth the shipping, besides the real loss to me is having to disasemble the heater again..	-1
not the same as I have ordered from parts express website in the past. Seem to be cheaper made and the "on/off" plate is much smaller.	-1
Works good but very light duty. Speed fast and on time	-1
This thing is flimsy and arrived scratched. It has rained once since i got it and it's already rusting.  Keep looking and avoid this.	-1
I guess my biggest dislike is that this "Deluxe" hitch mount Cargeo Basket does not fit the Valley Tow 91190 Deluxe Basket Folding Shank that I bought for $99. One would think that a product from the same company, "DELUXE" would be compatable, NOT. I'll keep it becasue I need it now. But people get it some where else. Valley tell me I'm wrong and how to make it work!	-1
Good product, but don't get from this vendor. All of the 12 cans were damaged, but luckily did not leak.	-1
Cheap price but cheap quality. Get the original club it is a much better product then this cheaper version.	-1
1 st time I used it would not release to remove...key turned ok to unlock but rod would not release...(it was not too tight against steering wheel)...after quite awhile it finally released after rotating rod back and forth what i could...tried a 2nd off the steering wheel...same thing..may try upgrading to original 1000 but don't trust this one now...	-1
My package was never delivered to me. It was through OnTrac. Amazon notified me that it's delivered at 2:57PM, but came home a couple hours and only my USPS package was there. I checked my front porch camera recordings to see if anyone stole it. Nope. Only the USPS guy delivered. It was quiet throughout the day. Would rate this 5 star, but since I never got my package, my good rating needs to hold off. I contacted customer service the OnTrac place, just crickets and nothing else. Was hoping I would get this today for my road trip with my family tomorrow. Guess I will have to make a stop at Autozone now.	-1
Too small for use on a 1960's size steering wheel.	-1
I don't use the product very often mostly because the locking mechanism is pretty cheap and I'm more concerned that I would be able to get it unlocked then I am that someone might steal my Jeep. I'm sure there is a better product out there.......	-1
Received band new club inside a sealed case, it looked like the paint was already peeling with black residues all over the club.  Opened up the box, the black residues mixed with yellow paint immediately came loose and stained my hands like a leaky laser printer toner.  YUck!  pay more and get a legit product.	-1
These did not work at all. It is a waste of space in the tool box soon to be moved to a junk box. I tried for awhile with no luck to make this tool function. I ended up cutting the end cap of a sharpie marker off about 3/4 inch long and cutting a split down it lengthwise to fit over the fuel line to slide into the disconnect and uncouple the line.  I did some grinding on the tool to try and make it fit between the filter and the fitting a also drilled out the center rivet in an attempt to make it work. The grinding did seem to help and with a bit more grinding in the right places I might have acheaved success. The removal of the rivet did NOTHING to help. I may put a bolt on place of the rivet and try to tune this into a workable tool in the future if I ever am really bored.	-1
I had to grind it down to fit an 05 Ford Freestar strut mount	-1
All I can say is.....eh.  I'm not sure what car you're working on but if you have a compass/patriot or a crown victoria/grand marquis  this tool won't work for you.  Its sad....very sad.  It has so much potential but the sizes included for the struts don't work on these cars.  I know it will work on other models perfectly if you don't have the luxury of air powered tools in your garage.  It WILL save you A TON OF TIME with hand tools.  I guess it's just buy it and try it, its a real simple tool that i'm confident will work but its mainly the vehicle's strut design that will determine the usefullness.	-1
Does not work on BMW struts	-1
Its a little difficult to work with. The clips do not like to stay in place while compressing a spring. Found zipties and a jig made it work.	-1
This thing is a pile of garbage. This was the only type of compressor I could find that would fit my job, and it sucks. It doesn't compress the spring straight, and slips horribly. Unless you have hours and hours to screw around with this, I wouldn't recommend it.	-1
First take a shallow or deep metric or SAE socket to see what exactly fits.  A 1996 Ford Contour needs to use the 18mm spark plug socket wrench, like the Motion Pro Spark Plug Socket 18mm with 12 points and an end that will accept a 13/16 crow foot flare nut wrench for torquing the strut nuts back on.  12 points and flare nut crow foot wrench will have better grip, than a 6 point. Although the 6 point wrenches and sockets are cheaper, and you'll want to have the spring coil compressed all the way any way, but 12 points are just better to avoid rounding the nuts off if they're not impact sockets.  The adapter here is for a 3/4" strut nut.  Cannot see how it works if you have to hold the strut rod with a 6mm allen wrench while turning the strut nut counter clockwise/clockwise with a 13/16 combination wrench (taking it off) or 13/16 crow foot flare nut wrench (putting on) the crow foot goes on a torque wrench to specific pound. Then you install it back on the car/truck, then torque the strut nut on top, sticking out under the hood. You have to hold the strut rod with the allen key either taking the nuts off or on and to torque them back on.  You'll use the crow foot wrench set any way, but you can buy them single.	-1
This kit did not work as designed. The socket is too short and fat to be usable for the intended purpose. Furthermore, if you try to use the 19mm (3/4") insert, it must go on the fattest end of the socket. It will never work there even if you try to grind down the sides because the socket will become too thin. I was able to grind down the outside of the narrowest part of the socket so I could insert it into the strut mount. The socket was larger than the 19mm nut on the strut, but it still worked good enough to get the nut off while holding the strut shaft with a socket, extension, and ratchet. However, the strut shaft was made for a metric socket that was not part of this kit. I had to use other tools. The chrome slot tools did not fit the new strut shafts well enough to hold them snugly, but was usable enough to hold them. However, one strut slot broke off after it became wedged in the chrome slot socket. I had to drill it out. I would suggest for a person to get the actual deep-well off-set socket for their exact size strut nut. With that said, the factory size nuts and the nuts shipped with a strut can differ. You really need to check your strut nut on the car and the strut nut shipped with the new strut before buying a socket. This kit should have four separate DEEP sockets instead of trying to cheap-out with one. I would have sent this back, but I ground the socket to get it to work. I was not about to have my car tore apart waiting for another tool.	-1
Product doesn't work very well. When attaching one side it doesn't give enough room to place the Spring Compressor on the other. Luckily I was able to get by with just one.  I bought a crappy pair from the likes of autozone and it worked much better.	-1
Before purchasing I talked to Wilmar to ask if the threads on the threaded rods were "Acme" threads and was told they were.  When the tool arrived the threads were standard.  I returned the tool and purchased another that stated Acme threads on the package.  The amount of pressure this tool experiences makes Acme threads important.	-1
the clearance between the tools is to tight and I would not allow me to turn strut nut until I ground strut holding tool down. It did accomplish the job for not much money. you get what you pay for.	-1
I bought one of these from Summit Racing in 2009 and couldn't get it to work right on a 65 Mustang I had borrowed and used a kd brand years ago with no issues.  On this one the hooks will not fit in between the coils and each hook needed to be trimmed shorter with a cutoff tool to fit. Then the threaded shaft was too long and I had to cut that shorter too.  Look else ware	-1
it seem to be ok i have not used it my spring set up did not work how ever it did seem to be a nice quality	-1
Bought this tool to replace the coilovers on my 1999 Miata. Used it again to replace the struts on my 2002 Protege`. Even though I had the screws well lubricated one of the nuts seized while doing the Protege` job. The threads are pretty well galled up on one of the tools now and I don't know if I want to continue to trust the safe operation of the tool.	-1
I do a lot of work on vintage muscle cars and reciently I needed an spring compressor to change coil springs in a 69 Nova. I purchased this item and on receiving it tried many times to get this tool to work. It would not hold and continued to slip off the coil. (Very Dangerous) on finally making the tool stay on the coil the tool bent before compressing the spring enough to replace. Very poor quality. I have called several times to the customer service with no answer or return call. ???	-1
Just bad product in 4 months I replace it to of them it's like a bad product faith one I bought from different store on their works fine I don't recommend this guy	-1
I wish very badly they made them with better quality. The idea is great, the look of them is great, they save tiore wear and make all your tires last much longer,.. they will not let both tires go down if one goes flat,.. BUT...  i have been using these things on my truck for 4 years now. They are made VERY CHEAP! though, and it is very annoying. They are so cheaply made that i tell other people to go buy a spare if they buy 4 of them,,.. because ONE OF FOUR WILL BE LEAKY OUT OF THE BOX!. Sometimes you get a good one that does not leak, and sometimes you get one that leaks like mad and your tires will constantly get low. It is NOT the hoses that leak. NOT the joints or the hoses,.. but the center unit itself that goes bad, and it is extremely annoying. The only reason I have them on my truck, is the benefits of what the units do for the tires long term. Otherwise, I would have thrown them in the garbage a long time ago.	-1
If I could do it all over again I would have not bought this battery charger.  I mainly bought it for the high amperage boost application to start vehicles with weak or dead batteries.  What I found is that the machine cranks up the voltage on the 300 amperage settings to alarming levels. I noticed this when my Mid 70's Pontiac Volt gauge got pinned during a boosted start. Turns out 30amp and 60 amp is enough for most starts anyway and the voltage is not crazy at these levels.  I also wish I would have bought a automatic charger instead of having to baby sit this thing. It asks for using a hydrometer for calculating charge times(good luck with a sealed battery). I ended up buying a cheapo automatic Menards charger to compliment this charger. The battery load test/charge test seems to work ok. Only two stars from me. Please rate this review if it was helpful.	-1
this charger does work but that's about it. the bean counters are really active at Schumacher.  this charger will not be around in 10 years . everything feels cheep from the timer to the rockers switches.  the cables are made of steel and not copper, the clamps are so weak a child could use them. the timer is some tick-tock wind up thing that feels like it came off a  toaster oven. Lets not forget the two cheep computer fans running at full blast, used to cool the thing, we can hear these fans running 100ft away over engine noise and traffic , they sound like a swarm of angry bee's, and after a while the pitch gets on our nerves. for me this charger replaced a 40 year old work horse that never broke down or needed a thing(and was quiet) .  then it was stolen, and now i have this ....it reminds  me every day just how cheep it is. I want to pack it up and send it back soo bad........and still might , i hate it.	-1
The fuse holder receptacle is way too tight.  I tried to insert a maxi fuse but it was so difficult that I bent the fuse prongs trying to insert it.  I had to loosen the receptable with a screw driver to make it work.  Even so, pulling the fuse from the fuse holder requires a pair of plyers.  I am disappointed since I wanted to use the fuse holder as a switch by pulling the fuse and reinserting the fuse.  Buyers beware.	-1
don't like it and wouldn't recommend it.	-1
Damaged when I got it. Wheels won't roll because the axel is to short. Assembly was easy but the metal is so thin the screws strip out easy. Cables are very light, not sure if this thing is built to last. Spend a little more and get a good one.	-1
This charger came with more screws than it was supposed too. The instructions tell you to remove screws from the body of the charger then place the handle and return the screws. The problem is the screws that were to be removed then reinserted were missing. The present holes are too small for any of the screws included. The brackets for the wheels which the instructions said to be careful not to drop into the unit had one fall in. The entire minor assembly which isn't much was a hassle. I now have a charger without a handle or wheels. This did not have to be such a project. It was just done too cheap. Considering there are many chargers out there I cannot recommend this one.	-1
I bought this charger and used it twice in 6 months and then it failed. Not only have I not had good experiences with this unit, it is my 4th Schmacher charger and they have all died early deaths. These were kept in a garage, used occasionally, and not mistreated or handled roughly.  Schmacher has such a huge presence in the market it is tough to escape them. I just wish they made a better quality product that doesn't fail or develop problems so quickly.	-1
Good construction with bad jumper cables! If charging a battery using this guy make sure you make it outdoor or stay there otherwise it could turn in to disaster, the cables heat and melt the plastic cover! I am looking in to replacing with larger gauge cable ASAP!	-1
low quality back yard use ....thin cables and not for professional use	-1
I plugged in my new Schumacher battery charger and it instantly started to make a bunch of smoke.  Never charged a single battery and Schumacher totally blew my off on my warranty claim.  Don't waste your money.	-1
I purchased 2 of these. Neither worked. When plugged in, smoked& sizzled!	-1
Wife gave me one for a Christmas present, 12/2015. Didn't use it until today, January 31st 2016. I plugged it into the wall and connected it to my battery. When I did, the clamps sparked! Before I connected it to my battery, I made sure it was off. Once it sparked, I made sure it was off. So, with the switch off, the battery clamps are live! I tried different positions on the switch, just to make sure the switch wasn't out of register. Nope, always has power to it. AND THEN, IT STARTED TO SMOKE! Stunk up my whole garage! Now what do I do with it?	-1
I replaced this unit with a CTEK since it was not doing the job on the trickle charger.  I'm not impressed.  CTEK smokes this unit for trickle charging my BMW.  I took this unit off after it said it was charged and put the CTEK on and it was only at 4 of 7 stars, it needed to charge more. Very disappointed.	-1
Very thin metal case, damaged during shipping, not very powerful.  Item returned and brought a 220 amp charger from Sam's at about the same price.	-1
Didnt work well the first time I used it.  Circular filed it.	-1
does not lock on the post well	-1
as always, for the average joe, the whole battery charging thing is a ball of confusion.  And this one doesn't do any better in figuring out what your batteries needs are.  Batteries usually are poorly labeled on all their specs and you can damage them if you set this or any charger on too high of charge.  It works, but I truly wish they'd make a charger that looks at the battery in question and automatically sets the proper charge rate without fear of damaging the battery.  Its probably out there, but lets face it, the directions should give you a list of the more common batteries and tell you some guidelines on charge settings.	-1
Used it 4 - 5 times clamps are China crap timer stoped and burned up a battery!!! Don't try this SE-3000 modle, crap China crap go to john deere!!!!!	-1
The unit arrived the box looked ok.  But the charger looked like it was drop kicked out of an airplane.	-1
i don't like it	-1
Very little flexibility so metal better be correct thickness or you'll be using a vice and flatblade to open them up	-1
TO SMALL	-1
Just look at the photo!!  After only four and a half months, these things look like crap.  My wife and I just bought two nice, blacked-out cars.  Black inside and out, black wheels, blackout packages on both.  Mine is a new Audi R8, and my wifes is a new Mercedes SL63.  And we ordered the new black California Legacy license plates.  Our cars are garage kept, professionally washed every week, and we live in a very moderate climate in Southern California.  And no, we do not live near the ocean.  Probably 12 miles from the ocean.  We both picked up our new cars 4 months ago, so these black license plate frames have been on our cars only 4 months.  I wanted a rather thin gloss black license plate frame that would cover the edges of the license plate.  This is the only one I could find that fit what I was looking for.  I was skeptical due to the low price.  I don't care about the price.  I should have known better.  On the website the company claims: Enduring quality that can be both seen and felt.  And they say these are powder coated.   The new black Legacy plates arrived today, so I took the plates off, and just look at what I saw on the license plate frames on BOTH cars.	-1
1 star is generous. Frame arrived bent, once I bent it back I tried putting the licence plate with it and the frame was to small for a standard licence plate.	-1
Major rust after 6 months. I bought a set for all 5 of our family's cars.  I have to take them off and throw them away.	-1
Started to oxidize/corrode after 6 months	-1
Well, my opinion has changed about Cruiser Accessories. Their products are complete junk. I got about 6 months use out of this 30630 license plate frame. It's pitted and starting to show rust through the chrome plating. This is the second frame from them that has done this. I will no longer buy their products.	-1
Cheap!	-1
Very simple, low quality...good price	-1
I have 2 of these plate frames on two different cars, one is on a car that is garaged and sees less than 10,000 miles a year, the other is on my daily driver car.  I have had these frames on the car for less than 3 months, and already they are starting to fade, turn grey, and the finish is chipping off. This is with hand washing and Meguiar's Soap and a simple garden hose.  I was assuming this was a good deal, but you really do get what you pay for. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 just because it's still technically one one piece, but no longer in one color OR in good condition...	-1
I have already thrown this product away. After one winter in Iowa, it is all rusty. I did try to use soft steel wool to bring it back. This worked well but only for a short time.  I would recommend a more durable product if you are in cold climates.	-1
Alright, I gave this 1-star for a reason.  I bought it for the front bumper of a 2013 Jeep Wrangler, only to realize it was too wide to fit between the fog-light cutouts.  It might work well for someone else, but it was a waste for me.	-1
The cover is barely tinted, and after a few months on the vehicle, the chrome is already beginning to peel off the frame.	-1
Pretty cheap.	-1
Like others stated, this frame is too small for my illinois license plate...the white edges of the plate stick out and show. Am returning.	-1
Looks great out of the box, but it pits and looks like crap in a matter of weeks.  Is it so hard to build a license plate frame that lasts!!!????!?!?!?!	-1
As mentioned by others, this does not 'frame' the license plate, rather sits on top of plate forming a Border NOT a frame. If outer edge was longer than inner edge then it would create a frame hiding the plate's edge. I had to file the entire edge (perimeter) of the license plate down just to have plate behind black border (took about an hour). My main intent was to have license plate edge covered to avoid chance of being cut while washing vehicle so in that regard this Border Trim fails. ***** I recommend AMAZON drop this item from the License Frame lineup*****	-1
This is a very poor quality mounting plate. Mine lasted just a few months before it started to crack and I ended up having to duct tape it to the bumper. After a year or so it broke away almost completely and I almost lost my front plate. I'm going to try the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Help-68148-Front-License-Plate-Bracket/dp/B000CO7DZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Help 68148 Front License Plate Bracket</a>. It's literally just a few dollars more and it's made of metal.	-1
I bought three of these because of the beautiful, simple design.  After two months on a new car which we don't drive in snow (and only 800 miles!) it's blistering from, I guess, residual salt dust.  On a new truck also only a couple months old that gets the full fury of Ohio winters, the frame is a mess with blisters or pits (the truck has 3,000 miles on it).  If you love in sunny California, this product is likely just what you need.  If you live elsewhere, try to find something made if plated plastic instead.  The damaged frames are on the back of the subject vehicles	-1
Careful, doesn't cover edges/corners of standard license plates. Otherwise, decent for the price.	-1
This item shipped defective. Parts not covered with chrome are rusting. This is usually a good product, I have purchased the same product recently and did have any problem. I need to have these two plates replaced.	-1
When new this is a nice Black Chrome or "Pearl Black" solid feeling license plate frame.  Matching plastic screw covers give it a nice clean finished look.  Looks and feels like nice quality.  Problem was after just 1 winter, it started to corrode and although I could continue to use it, it just doesn't look good with the corrosion.  The corrosion is not rust color, more like a white-ish color that you get on pot metal.  Am able to get it to look a little better with chrome cleaner but longer term this will need to be replaced in order to maintain a good look.  In all fairness I am in a state that uses salt in the winter so maybe in warmer states this might stay looking good longer.  I guess the more expensive stainless steel pearl black frame would have been a better choice.	-1
This frame(Cruiser Accessories 21330 Slim Rim, Chrome License Plate Frame) is too small to be usable unless license plate is cut to fit.  Ridiculous.  This item should not be offered by Amazon.  http://www.amazon.com/Cruiser-Accessories-21330-Chrome-License/dp/B00032K32A/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t	-1
Way too long for a simple license plate fastener.  So using the small provided torques tool was a pain.  Not to mention you need to keep it where won't forget it, in case you ever have to remove your plates.  They should have used a standard hex.  Also, the nuts matched my stainless steel plate frame but, as you can see by the picture, the heads, which is the part you see doesn't match at all.	-1
Rust in a month	-1
Will fit an 2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia if you don't use a frame or cover, or both. If you use those, as well as the plate, the rear view camera will be in the way and it isn't really worth it.	-1
Is big and flashy and attracts too much attention for a plate frame.	-1
Flimsy ! Not worth buying	-1
It came just as pictured, but it didn't fit my 2006 Toyota Camry.  The diameter was just slightly to big and the threads seem to be finer than I thought they would be.  Maybe the other model 81230 would fit, not sure.  My recommendation for the seller: Please put the MM diameter and thread type on the product description, both affect the fitting. It would also eliminate guessing or having to ask.  Then I could simply take one of my screws go to Lowe's hardware put it into the screw and thread chart they have where the screws are, and then determine the proper thread and size for my car.  And for anyone reading, no, my Lowe's didn't carry security screws for license plates, I checked while I was there.	-1
Broke off on my first tow dolly trip. Lost the plate and everything. It has to be backed up with a solid backing.	-1
Poor quality. Lock nut did not work.	-1
not so user friendly	-1
Screws too long for my 09 VW	-1
These were useless.  They didn't fit the holes of my license plates.  They were way too big!	-1
They stripped very easily, I would not recommend.	-1
these are very long, I wasn't able to use them, because they'd have to go through the car.	-1
Doesn't include any useful hardware. If you're going to sell a kit, sell a kit.	-1
These things were very difficult to install. The wrench was very poorly made it did not fit properly into the Allen screws. The torques fitting was on the wrong end of the Allen wrench so there was no leverage. The Allen wrench kept spinning inside the screw was nearly impossible to tighten. I do not recommend!	-1
It looks better and functions better in picture.	-1
These don't fit my Toyota, BMW or Subaru... so I'm not entirely sure what "import" they fit.  Anyway, they're stainless and appear to be made well.  I'm quite confident they won't rust on the shelf in my garage.	-1
This item is useless. If you have a front bumper that is angled, DO NOT buy this item. As I needed to use my vehicle and had been given a fixit ticket, I was forced to use this with tie wraps until I can get the correct one. Yes, the dash is where I had the plate, but the officer said it laid to flat and could not be seen, so..............	-1
FALSE ADVERTISING !!  PICTURE AND DESCRIPTION CLEARLY SHOWS THESE ARE "HEX" AND NOT "STAR" SHAPED. RECEIVED THE "SWITCH & BAIT" PRODUCT -THE STAR. I NEEDED HEX TO GET MY LICENSE PLATES OFF MY CAR. FALSE ADVERTISING !! Even weeks later, the same hex pix is being displayed, RIGHT NOW !! It's a fine product -BUT NOT WHAT I NEEDED NOR ORDERED.	-1
I was some how optimistic... overly optimistic that the item would be as described.  It's not metal, it's cheap plastic  Don't believe the item description:  "Rim frame made of die cast zinc & the bubble shield is acrylic Enduring quality that can be both seen and felt Each metal frame is carefully hand polished"  It's just black and clear plastic	-1
Absolutely useless.  It doesn't conform to the standards of u.s. license plates.  YOU CAN'T PUT A PLATE COVER OVER IT.  It needed two sets of holes, or a slot so you could bolt it on and then a plate and cover.  All you can do is put a plate on, and the included screws are TOO SHORT.	-1
The bracket is OK. It's a quality product. It doesn't fit the car I bought it for and I didn't/couldn't return it so now I'm stuck with it. If you have a 2013+ Outback, look at the C+C bracket.	-1
Looks awkward once installed, size/shape wrong	-1
after 3 month all rusty	-1
The stainless steel is starting to rust.  After 3 winters.	-1
This frame had sharp edges and looked as if it would seriously scratch my car wherever it came into contact with the paint. It also looked like low quality steel and had some surface scratches in the polished finish. Returned.	-1
Dont stay well	-1
Looks good, but I got this for the front of my 2003 Chevy Cavalier and I have a feeling that when I go thru the car wash it will be crumpled and mangled just like the cheaper plastic ones I was buying -- Live and learn, I guess	-1
Suction cups hold for maybe two days.	-1
...as it is seriously flimsy, has sharp edges, and there are nicer alternatives available. Value for money? Not this time!	-1
Tried to order this with another product, and it told me to buy more stuff... I don't want more stuff, i just want these suction thingys and a sunshade. I canceled my order. I'll just use adhesive like I was using before.	-1
The plate cover and frame do not line up. Have no idea how that happens	-1
Crap. Came all scratched and the outside frame doesnt line up well. Cheaply made.	-1
The two pieces don't go together and my PA plates don't fit into the cover so you would need 2 inch screws to attach this mess to your car with nothing clicking together. .  The black plastic part around the gray cover is very thin and IF it fit would break very easy.  I just screwed the gray cover over the license plate instead of throwing it all away.	-1
I do not recommended, it's barely darker than clear. In my opinion it's not tinted at all.	-1
cheap...	-1
Both of mine have broken	-1
Frame is tooooooooo small for the shield,  don't waste your money	-1
not durable	-1
Fit poorly. Was not a fan	-1
Really flimsy plastic frame, shield is pretty durable.	-1
Can't use any more.	-1
These screws are way too big for either one of my cars and thread pattern is also different therefore these are useless and the seller does not accept returns.  These would not fit on a Nissan or Mercedes.	-1
This is not a powder coated frame, it is cheap plastic. The black frame does not wrap around the clear plastic but sit on top of it so when you like at the side of it you see a sandwish effect, real dumb design. It would have been very easy to have the frame cover the sides as well...cheap.	-1
Didn't fit my 2013 Ram 1500 SLT	-1
Worked great on my 2017 silverado - sucks you have to buy 2 kits to get 6 screws and don't even use the plastic push ins - factory GM ones work just fine... FYI its much cheaper from your usual local auto parts stores. I paid $2 less a package (about $3 a pack) buying locally for the same package and brand. Tool fits nicely but only is star on the long end - cant torque them down much.	-1
it doesn't really fit a standard license plate, and if you try to get it to fit it will break strait away.  If you over tighten it will break.  It warns you of this on the package, but it doesn't seem like it is anywhere even remotely close to being 'over tightened' before it will burst into cracked fragments.  I like the concept of the product, but this particular model/maker is just crap.	-1
Nothing special......	-1
did not work	-1
Does not match BMW license bracket needs.	-1
Ok	-1
Did not use, just stuck them in my screw box, not worth returning!	-1
Arrived broken and the holes were crooked. The picture makes it look much more tinted than it was, also its very thin material.	-1
These break soooooo easily. I bought 3. 1 broke. Autozone has these for almost $20 with tax a PIECE! Buy them. Just be careful tightening them.	-1
The set I received was defective. There is a thin metal piece sticking out of the middle of the screw head. Because of this metal piece the included star shaped allen wrench could not fit into the screw enough to turn it. I was so frustrated by the poor design that I chose to return it even thou I usually count the loss for items this cheap. To my surprise no returns are accepted for this item, even after letting them know the ones I received were defective. Hell, at this point I would accept a replacement as long as it actually works properly but no dice. Buy with caution.	-1
I'm pleased with the appearance of these on my nouveau plate cover, but they feel incredibly cheap and I don't expect them to stay on while driving down the road. I understand you need to be able to take them back off, but I feel like they're going to fall off on their own!  We'll see how it turns out.	-1
Screws are to large, didn't fit in plastic caps, wasted money	-1
No clue why this got such a great rating. In order to install this you need to make fairly large hose to pop in the plastic anchors. There's no way I would drill a hole that big into my bumper let alone multiply holes. Don't recommend this product at all.	-1
Will not fil	-1
didn't fit. not returnable.	-1
not as descriptor	-1
Ehh.. looks too big and doofy looking for the size of a license plate.	-1
was wrong type	-1
Waste of money.	-1
didn't fit standard license plate screw, broke really easy	-1
cheap...	-1
They do not fit my 2013 rav4.	-1
screws didn't fit the rear holes.	-1
Did not work for my car, ask for refund	-1
Covers are ok one broke upon install way to small for the screws had to replace them.	-1
FREE TIP: before ordering, remove one of the screws that are currently holding your license plate, and compare the size/length and the thread type with that of these screws.  Wish I'd done that, would've saved me the hassle of having to send these back.  The other puzzling thing about this kit is how in the world one is supposed to use the included 4 plastic nuts...darn package DOES *NOT* INCLUDE INSTRUCTIONS OF ANY KIND, zero, nada, zip.  My rear license plate is held in place with a plastic nut that clips onto the opening in the bumper surface---these plastic nuts do not have any such clipping functionality, so they appear to be basically useless.  Bleedin' idiotic packaging and design.  The four bolts and the included special wrench seem to be ok, otherwise.	-1
1)  Plastic baggie came ripped.  Only arrived w/ 3 out of 4 2)  White plastic cap too small to fit over factory screw heads	-1
This did not fit the bolts on my license plate which are 10mm standard car bolts.  Were way too big.  Would have been great if they did as they are just plastic caps to cover the bolts.	-1
I drive a 2010 Ford Fusion. This screws do not fit my vehicle; they are too large. The package says "Fits most American vehicles". I would assume that it would at least fit a Ford, but I guess not. I know it's not guaranteed to fit all vehicles. They are quite expensive too - $6 for FOUR screws?!	-1
Looks good but poor quality control. The caps fit way to lose. I had to use silicon glue to hold them on.	-1
If your car is parked in an area where it is at risk for plate theft, I suppose this is a good idea. I have several complaints. Obviously if you lose the tool you have a real problem if you need to remove the tags. Also, the tool only fits the screw on the long axis. Anyone who has used an allen wrench knows you get much more torque by inserting the short end into the screw and turning with the long end. If you have a frame over your plate you may have difficulty getting the screws tight enough. You may need to insert the short end of the tool into something to give you more leverage. It would be handy if Cruiser Accessories could re-design the tool so it works at both ends. I also thought the screw heads could be a bit wider. Overall it took extra time to apply with no real advantage for me.	-1
Did not fit the mounting bracket without major modification Bolts are wayyyyy toooo long and rub against the vehicle  sux....	-1
These screws takes a lot of effort to install in the rear of 03 corolla, and front just doesn't install.	-1
The fasteners seem to be stainless steel, which is perfect, but the wrong thread pitch. Do yourself a favor and purchase this "Cruiser Accessories 81500 Stainless Steel Ultimate Kit Star Pin Locking Fastener"  instead. It will have all you will need and costs $7.54	-1
way freaking overprice	-1
Does not fit at all in front screw inlets, kind of fits in the rear screw inlets. I should have went to Autozone!	-1
Don't fit well, difficult to instal.	-1
Zero stars! Does not even remotely fit on the factory license plate screws. Junk!	-1
FALSE ADVERTISING !!  PICTURE AND DESCRIPTION CLEARLY SHOWS THESE ARE "HEX" AND NOT "STAR" SHAPED. RECEIVED THE "SWITCH & BAIT" PRODUCT -THE STAR. I NEEDED HEX TO GET MY LICENSE PLATES OFF MY CAR. FALSE ADVERTISING !! Even weeks later, the same hex pix is being displayed, RIGHT NOW !! It's a fine product -BUT NOT WHAT I NEEDED NOR ORDERED.	-1
WON'T FIT THE AVERAGE SCREW THAT COME ON NEW CAR FOR MOUNTING THE PLATES.	-1
These are cheap plastic covers.  At $4.99 was a rip off.  Every one of the retainers split during installation rendering the cheap plastic caps useless.	-1
Wouldn't fit our cars screws/bolts.  Ended up getting some glossy black metal paint and dipped into the paint can holding screws/bolts by threads while into small plastic clamps, then hung overnight.  Looks FABULOUS!	-1
The covers pop off and are worthless.  Don't buy this junk!  Looks great when you install but the covers won't stay on when the car is moving.	-1
I purchased the Cruiser locking fasteners and these to cover the screws. None of the covers fit over the screws. Total waste of money.	-1
Very cheaply made	-1
Too lightweight for me, but I have to say they were pretty inexpensive.  I guess "you get what you pay for" applies here.	-1
Cheap and lightweight but look at the price.....	-1
Don't buy it its super cheap plastic and it was illegal in my county to cover the county or the registration sticker on the license plate.  I would have gotten 2 tickets if I hadn't asked a cop about it.	-1
Absolute Trash	-1
These frames did not fit my 2015 Jeep Wrangler JKU on the front or rear brackets.	-1
Bought these to replace the stock license plate frame the dealers put on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited sahara, however, upon receiving it, it didn't fit so I asked for a full refund and returned it back to Amazon.  Arrived in time, returning and getting a full refund was no problem. the material seems weak and brittle, a little too cheap but you get what you pay for in this world, right? =)  overall, it might be good for other vehicles, it didn't fit my JKU, so for other JEEP JKU owners; be advised, it doesn't fit our rear license plate bracket. Didn't even bother with the front.	-1
These don't fit. I tried them on two cars, but the screws that the dealerships use are two big. The head of the license plate screws are two wide in diameter to fit into the plastic retainers.	-1
looks nice and clean.	-1
It's okay...got it to replace a chrome version because of some oxidation...ended up not using this and getting another chrome version for about the same price...rather have it look/fit well and get one every two years than get this one.  Overall...it's okay if you want a black license frame.	-1
Very cheap plastic looking.  I can't seem to find a screw they fit over, they didn't fit on my plate screws, went to the hardware screws and all the ones with the same size / thread all have heads bigger than these.  Oh well.  Honestly I didn't like the cruiser frame much either, I'll probably just toss it all.	-1
These do NOT fit over standard license plate screws.  They are far too small.  It's not even close.  The description of the product does not state that it requires special screws.	-1
This product consist of 8 little items - 4 cover caps & 4 washers for the caps to snap onto ... This company sent me a set of the above, with 1 of the washers obviously split, damaged, & useless. Are you kidding me ? Oh well, I guess 3 out of 4 ain't too bad - GHEEEEEZ, aggravation over a product this insignificant ...	-1
These chrome caps would not work on my plate. The license plate screws heads were larger than the plastic rings that hold the caps. I ended up using them on my motorcycle. These caps were less money at my local Harley dealer too. I'd give them a pass next time.	-1
Misleading description, very disappointed. Visually it fits in, but I know that I have put a plastic cover on my car if I use these.	-1
fell off almost immediately ---  but it was cheap so no big loss...  only someone anal as me would think the small lic plate screws need covering :)	-1
Amazon should drop this supplier.  The license plate frame is useless because it is too small to fit the plate.  Worthless.	-1
Cheap crappy screws. Stripped with almost no force applied.	-1
cheap plastic,breaks if tightened	-1
I tried to use these on my motorcycle license plate cover and found two of them snapped off with minimal torque! Stay away from these, use stainless hardware that can still use the black caps if needed for the blacked-out look.	-1
These are cheap plastic that break with the most mild of pressure.  I broke 4 of 8 just trying to screw them in, even when trying to be careful.  Don't trust your plate with these screws.	-1
Can't torque them down without them stripping. I'd return them, but more $ and hassle than it's worth. Buy somehting metal.	-1
The screws come with plastic nuts not the metal locking nuts in the picture.  The screws are too short to be used with anything else (cover or bracket).	-1
I didn't read the posting very thoroughly and didn't realize they were solid nylon.  One of them snapped off when I gave it the final turn to tighten it.  I ended up pulling the interior off my rear hatch on my Lexus RX to get it out.  I went to a local hardware store and bought stainless steel ones for 13 cents each and I'm using them instead.  Also I wanted to note that the phillips head on these screws is quite unorthodox.  you'll notice that it's just two slits and not angled like most screws are.  Anyway you'll find that if you have a toolbox full of screwdrivers, only one will fit these screws.	-1
The screws are incredibly weak.  All of them snapped when tightening into pre-drilled license plate holes.  I suggest staying away from these and all Nylon screws.	-1
Had dremel tool out a groove to make sure it properly seats around 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited....looks good though.	-1
didn't fit my dash!  could not replace dash panel with this unit installed	-1
junk	-1
DOES NOT WORK ON FLIP OUT DVD	-1
Doesnt fit dash cutout of my dodge properly - hole for radio is too small to fit the DIN radio I bought - I was unable to use this.	-1
shows that it fits my vehicle, but it does not 2006 Chrysler PT Cruiser, even though it says it does.	-1
Got these for my Chevy Avalanche. A little pricey, but I wanted something that wouldn't rust in a couple years. Quality seems good and they look great(for now). They are not the cheap, thin chrome plated tin, but heavy solid cast metal.  I just got them two weeks ago, so I can't respond to the rust situation yet. So far...very satisfied.   UPDATE July 2014: both frames started pitting and chalking like most other cheap chrome frames. Took them off and tossed 'em.. Not worth the money.	-1
I ended up buying an installation kit from Crutchfield, much higher quality and only a few dollars more.  This piece was a disappointment.	-1
ok	-1
I originally purchased and installed the Bulldog Security Deluxe500B Remote Starter with the Bypass Module included but it was missing the key latch used to secure the key. In order to complete the installation I just taped the key inside. Bulldog wanted me to send the entire Deluxe500B Remote Starter to them..... So I figured it best to just purchase this JBS bypass module, guess what? it was also missing the key latch so I sent it back to Amazon. My key is still secured by electrical tape in the original bypass module.	-1
This should be for emergencies only. On my 2008 Chevy Silverado, it distorted the shape of the chrome bumper	-1
My older model Ford F350 front bumper curves at the bottom just a bit further than this thing can reach. If it had just one more link it would be perfect. But, alas, it is flawed in this manner. Chances are that this item will not work on but the simplest of bumper designs.	-1
This kit is just ok.  Every piece in the kit is extremely light weight.  If you are a mall crawler and only hit fire roads than this will do fine, if it's much more than that then look at the ARB kits.	-1
You would be better off going to the hardware store and buying your own D-rings, chains and hooks. Be cheaper and better quality. This kit is just confusing also.	-1
Not what you see on the photo. Straps are way shorter... I returned it	-1
God what a waste of money, the cover is so thin it broke right of the bat. Even when fully installed the thing ripped like it was dry rotten, don't waste your money, the material is cheap and to thin to be of any help, pass and have one made at a upholstery center.	-1
Cheap material. Does not fit a 60" jack.	-1
Came pre ripped at the top.  Pretty cheap materials but works just like as well as the garbage bag I previously used.	-1
While putting it on my jack the first time it tore. It has gotten worst. Not worth the money.	-1
The Hi-lift jack gets 5 starts the cove is made the cheapest material known to man. It riped the first time I put it on the jack.  It was like the material was rotten DO NOT PURCHASE the cover.	-1
The thing comes rolled up really tight, so tight it's hard to unfurl it to use it. It's super thin too, made out of cheap material if you ask me.  I ripped holes in it the first time I put the jack in it.  Maybe I wasn't patient enough, but it's really sad to ruin a brand new item before you get to use it.  Great idea if it were a little more heavy duty.  I expected better from Hi Lift, their Jacks are fantastic!	-1
Need I say more? Test fitting it in the living room on my new hi lift, tore the protector. Pissed. Just gonna use it as a template and make my own, out of better material. So, buy it, to make your own...	-1
Not well thought out.. Would not buy this again, a little Velcro would go along way not easy to slip cover on and then mark where you are to punch hole in the thing. They make a boot cover that just covers the lower parts of the jack should of got that	-1
I bought this case to protect my 60" Hi-Lift Extreme jack.  It is completely unacceptable:  (1) The fabric seems to be a fabric-backed vinyl which is far too weak and flimsy:  For example, despite treating it gently I tore a big hole in it when the top of the jack snagged slightly the second time I was sliding the jack into the case.  (2) It is too short:  the bottom 12" of the 60" jack will not fit into the case, leaving it unprotected.  (3) It is too narrow:  I have to remove the top clamp of the Hi-Lift Extreme jack and remove the handle protector that Hi-Lift sells before the jack can be inserted into the case.  (4) The closure is poor:  There is a cheesy drawstring at the mouth of the case that is too wimpy for the stiffness of the fabric.  (5) The hi-lift jack is justly popular for off-road use.  A case for it should be able to cover the whole jack and be rugged enough to be strapped down in the back of a pickup, or stored with other gear in the back of a van, and survive normal off-road gear-handling.  This case is not at all up to the job.	-1
The span of the straps is too small and straps too short to work with my factory 17" forged aluminum rims on my 2011 GM 2500HD truck. Good in concept  but the hook part of the design needs to be improved.	-1
Didn't work on my 2015 stock 17 in rims for the jk without tearing.	-1
I got this item as expected.  Thanks Amazon.  If you notice in the image, the stitching is up near the block and there is a good bit of strap between the lowest stitching and the hooks.  In most images I see on the web of this product there is about 4 to 6 inches between where the hook is and the lowest stitching.  Mine there is about 2 inches.  Recently, I discovered that I cannot spread the hooks far enough apart to be used as it is intended.  Since this is not an every day usage thing, that I have just discovered it means I cannot return it.  Thus Buyer Be Aware (instead of beware).  It isn't a bad product, but quality control might be lacking a little if a product without enough reach is sent out it could leave you stranded if you expect to use it without testing it ahead of time.  So test it, verify it will work on your vehicle as soon as you get it and thus you are not surprised like I am to have a product that is unusable.  Moreover, the 2 stars comes primarily from the fact I reached out to the company (not Amazon) and they never responded to any of my questions.	-1
Strap does not separate wide enough to work on most wheels.	-1
Purchased this 12 v solenoid switch from Amazon. Product was received quickly and in good condition. The product description was for a winch but the picture was for the solenoid switch for a 12 v winch. So I risked the order. What was received was exactly as pictured. Tried to use the solenoid as a switch to control a 12V motor, and it would not turn the 12V power on or off for a 12V bulb indicating that the switch was defective. Tried it with a larger load, still no function Returned the switch using Amazon's excellent service.	-1
I bought 5 different sets of license plate fasteners due to mixed reviews and didn't want to go through the hassle of changing out the plate later.  1) The product received was as described (packaging had the Cruiser Accessories 80230 Fasteners, Domestic-Steel labeling on it) 2) These are steel, as stated in the description  I did a rudimentary corrosion test by half-submerging them in salt/water for 24 hrs then rinsing them off and letting them sit for another 24 hrs  Of the 5 packs, this is the only one that started to corrode.  Each of the others were similarly shaped and priced	-1
Very flimsy. Broke upon installing in dash.	-1
too heavy buy good for removing snow from car	-1

not impressed with it,expected it to work much better	-1
Lightweight use. Ok for weekend do it yourselfers	-1
The part description is for otc 6496. The package I got says the right number. The tool in the package is number 518684. It says so right on the tool. Cheap pot steel instead of the hardened tool steel advertised.	-1
BROUGHT THIS TOOL TO DO MY UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINT'S, BROUGHT THE MASTER SET,LOOKED UP MY DODGE IN THEIR INSTRUCTION BOOK THAT TELLS YOU WHAT TOOLS TO USE.THE INSTRUCTION'S FOR DODGE ARE VERY BAD,THE CHEV AND FORD ARE EASY TO FOLLOW.I CALLED ASTRO PNEUMATIC FOR HELP,THE FIRST MAN TOLD ME YOU JUST HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT,CALLED BACK THE SECOND MAN WAS HELPFUL,HE LOOKED AT THE INSTRUCTION BOOK AND SAID THEY WERE HAVING A LOT OF PEOPLE CALLING NEEDING HELP WITH THE SAME PROBLEM I'AM HAVING.SAID HE WOULD LOOK IN TO IT AND GET BACK TO ME.WAITED 2 WEEKS NO PHONE CALL OR E-MAIL.E-MAIL THEM NICOLE FISHER E-MAILED BACK SAID SHE WAS SORRY,AND SENT THE SAME INSTRUCTION BOOK.CALLED HER SHE HOOKED ME UP WITH RUBIN HE GAVE ME WHAT TOOL NUMBERS TO USE BUT THEY DIDN'T MATCH WHAT WAS IN THE INSTRUCTION BOOK,I ASKED HOW HE GOT THESE NUMBER HE SAID HE BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEARS AND KNOWS WHICH TOOLS TO USE.HE ALSO SAID YOU MIGHT HAVE TO MODIFY SOME OF THE TOOLS TO MAKE THEM WORK.I GOT MY BALL JOINT DONE BUT WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM ASTRO PNEUMATIC TOOL CO AGAIN.    RGW EL CERRITO,CALIF	-1
Doesn't work on my 2001 Chevy Suburban	-1
The puller set was complete and of decent quality, but the attachment I needed was broken on arrival. Amazon refunded	-1
not worth it. The clamp's threads strip out after only using it on one car. I'm afraid to use it on a 2nd car. Waste of your money, sad to say. wish I knew what else to buy.	-1
The unit I received had the same thread on both of the installers.  There should have been 1 course thread and 1 fine thread.  It came with different color installers as shown but both of mine were fine thread.  I needed course thread for my 97 chevy truck with a HT6 compressor.  Nothing worse than having somthing pulled apart and needing to make another 20 mile trip to town to rent another tool to finish the job.	-1
Seams cheep quality but we will see don't like how all the finish is Rough and everything binds up with a load it does not work smoothly save your money buy good quality tool	-1
Broke the first time I used it	-1
Rivets are made of very cheap metal.	-1
It fits, but not properly. Also doesn't have the leverage to easily pull and install pullies without use of a breaker bar.	-1
complete junk...  Pro - covers a lot of pulleys, pretty much anything 1994 to present  Con- - pusher pins are steel, but waaaaay to soft a grade, mine bent on the first try and got lodged in the PS axle - remover clamshell is too loose and isn't properly documented.. the instructions don't note that one side of th clamshell has a deeper lip than the other...  sets up a situation for the clamshell to be too loose with the sleeve around it and end up ripping off the hub / damaging the pulley.. yup that happened to me too - thrust bearing has no lube on it and doesn't move properly as delivered and isn't do0vumneted  complete junk that will damage your pulley	-1
The installer tool snapped off the first time I used it with the pulley about half way in.  On one of the other installer tools the last two threads were damaged as well.	-1
Didn't fit properly and broke the power steering pulley on my 98 Chevy 7.4 Vortec.  That cost $15 to replace the pulley.  The Autozone loaner tool was able to remove the damaged pulley and fit much better.	-1
There should be a negative rating because this would definitely be a negative 5 star for me. Not durable at all. Spend more money and buy the right tool for the job. This is not worth 20 bucks and that cheap. Get what you pay for.	-1
Unit appears well designed but poorly manufactured.  Screw is a very loose fit in the body and will probably strip the threads after a few hard uses.	-1
Threads are chowdered after a single use.  I even pre-lubed them with high pressure grease.  It did remove the pitman arm, but after that the tool was junk.  So I spent $50 on a tool to prevent me from buying a $20 pitman arm.	-1
Pulled 2 pitman arms, and on the 3rd....it stripped the pulled. What a waste of money. Very disappointed in OTC. And then they raised the price???! Why?? Why would I pay more now for a product that I know doesn't work?	-1
you can do the same thing this stuff does with 'seafoam' for a fraction of what you pay for the OTC product! I bought it one time, not knowing any better. So take my advise and go with seafoam.	-1
Seems to have redundant sizes (just different depth) and yet doesn't have in between sizes that I would have needed.	-1
I've been doing drum brakes on Hondas and parking shoes on Chryslers and Kias, and this tool kit has been useless each time. There's too much variation out there, and in the end, this tool set isn't going to be anywhere near the mark to be useful.  For drum brakes, get used to making use of other tools instead -- flat-head screwdrivers, regular and needle-nose vise grips, and the like.	-1
Brake pliers are worthless, the tools are very poorly made, no one ever used them to do brakes!	-1
No instructions and no videos on YouTube that explains how to use this tools.  I ended up using a plier and Philip screwdriver to do most of the work	-1
nonsense waste of money	-1
I received this kit and it is missing some of the tools, and the cost of returning is not worth it I'll use what I have and will not purchase anything from this dealer.	-1
I purchased this product because it said it included the 4wd adapters. It does not have the correct adapters to fit the Dana 30 used in both my Jeep Cherokee and Grand Cherokee. So now I have a worthless product that I will either store forever, or donate to Goodwill.	-1
was missing one of the pieces and does not work for ball joints pressed in from the bottom. I did not return because I needed it to get the old ones out and was in a hurry.	-1
didn't have the adapter I needed for a ford	-1
the span needs to be bigger! i bought this to install a set of ball joints on a mustang, a mustang! one of the most common vehicles on the road. I ended up cutting one of the spacers in half because the span on the press was so small. It was classified as a truck/4x4 press, I took one look at my ford truck and bought a different press because this on didn't even come close to fitting.	-1
Barely got the job done. It's scrap metal now.. press failed and receiver's bent . I don't recommend this kit..	-1
The C-clamp section didn't have enough length to properly remove a Ford Taurus ball joint. I had to torch off the entire spindle part of the ball joint to make the remover fit. After that, it did work well.	-1
These were very uncomfortable to wear even for a few minutes. They have no nose bridge and the plastic is hard and rather sharp across the nose. Second issue is that the foam is useless. It does not come even close to the face so it offers absolutely no protection from air or debris (such as bugs, dust and old beer cans).  Not really recommended for motorcycle riders.	-1
Lets air in around lenses at over 40mph speeds and quality very cheap. One lens fell out after maybe half a dozen uses. I use them on my motorcycle. You pay for what you get. Better off purchasing the curv-z riding glasses for a little more money.	-1
Broke after 3 rivets then had to use my old 6 dollar one which was harder to use but worked each time.	-1
very cheaply made, not at all like the older version with the same part number that was made in the USA !!! the arms flex and rivets get stuck! Shame on you astro and amazon!	-1
this tools work just like a harbor freight riveter.  it can barely handle a 3/16 fastener.	-1
Right out of the box this unit did not work correctly so I had to return it; so frustrating.  It would not grab and pull the rivet.	-1
I have two complaints about this riveter.  1. The different heads are very easy to lose. They are stored in threaded holes in the handle, but do not tighten down like every other riveter. The sloppy fit makes them easy to lose. Replacements are not available. I have lost several, but, fortunately, was able to find them. I no longer depend on the threaded holes for storage.  2. The plastic jar to catch the used stems is a loose fit on its cap, and falls off while in use, spilling them all over.  What is it with China and threads?  But, it does pull 1/4 rivets, so I will just have to live with its faults. I would give it 4 stars without those faults.	-1
I purchased this exact bottle from a local store. But the sprayer did not work at all. The tip of the sprayer could be rotated from off to spray, which i did several times, and it would not work. Then finally I got tired of trying to make it work, I opened up the top and poured out the contents into another spray bottle. Was I surprised how little content was in the bottle, and it sure was not 16 oz as they claim. I used it up on the front of my car and I was not very liberal in spraying, to hold up some for my other car, but it did not keep over for my other car. Well paying $8.15, tax included, it was very expensive for one treatment. After spraying it and waiting about 5 minutes, I washed it off using a sponge in soap and water, and it all came out easily.  Well that was the only redeeming factor.	-1
Bought because sea foam stated it would remove break dust and it did not!!!!	-1
What an overpriced, poor quality kit. The stampings on the jets and needles, are barely visible and the 2 jets I need, there are only one of them. Poor quality control!!! Plus, if you open it, it's yours. Impossible to know if all the right parts are inside. Im stuck with $70 worth of garbage now! I'm going Holley for everything next time.	-1
ordered this to change the jets on my 1406.  I had three of the same jets and only one of the other.  makes the one usless.  second package from edelbrock that was missing parts or was incomplete.	-1
does not fit stock on older GM cars. I tried it on my 63 409 Chevy as well as my 60 Buick 401 and there is a leak between the manifold and the carbs. This leak reduced the manifold vacuum enough to stall the engine. In both cases I was using this with Carter AFB carbs.	-1
This filter now sits on the shelf in my shop. I have a 2001 Tacoma Prerunner. This filter did nothing for performance nor MPG. May work okay for others, total waste of money for me.	-1
Its the wrong oil i don't care what it says.  My turbo was fine.  when i used 5w-40  spooled up smoothly.  using this after 900  miles i started noticing turbo boost drop offs. mind you this is  a stock k03 turbo. known to be very reliable if you use recommended oil.  I had a turbo bearing failure.cant wait to see what Valvoline says about that	-1
Haven't had a problem until now. I had my oil thin out enough to blow by my rear main while towing, I actually lost about a quart and a half in the span of an hour. Switching to a thicker viscosity gave me the same results. I would guess I just got a bad batch maybe? (2002 F-350 V10)	-1
The key description for this item is "plastic"  -- "high impact"??  I had one of these and it deformed.  Let me think, fuel and heat mix in a little plastic -- what does high impact mean.  What would be wrong with making these out of metal"  After mine deformed it would not fit back on correctly.  So, I got a coffee can and cut an inch around the top off with tin snips and took some of that metal tap and taped the splice up.  Works perfects, two years later and it is still the same as when I put it under the air cleaner.	-1
Terrible. Had it for 2k miles in and had to change to M1 because of the faulty converter and o2 sensor codes. Car ran weird, had hard start-ups. I'm very disappointed and hopefully it didn't damage my engine!	-1
I had been using Amsoil Signature 100 % synthetic in my 2012 truck. I was getting an average of 19.0 mpg. I thought I'd switch to Valvline synthetic becuase it's easier to come by and much cheaper. After switching to Valvoline Synthetic the mpg went down to 18.4. My driving habits did not change, nor did my route to work. I also noticed the Valvoline turned very dark much quicker than other synthetics I've used which leads me to think there is parafin in the oil. Is Valvoline Syn power 100% synthetic? I would not bet my life on it. I'm going back to Amsoil and not chancing my engine and fuel mileage with this product. I don't need fancy tests to show me Amsoil is the best oil to use,experience tells me it's the best.	-1
My gas mileage has reduced about 15% with this filter. Cleaning it is expansive and a pain, I ended up returning to paper filter.	-1
There are lots of tire gauge out there.  Most are lousy and inaccurate.  This one is easy to use and accurate as a tire gauge should.  Addition 11/29/16  After 2 years, the gauge does not hold pressure anymore.  Can' read it.	-1
Poorly made. Did not last 5 minuets out of the box.  Very unhappy with my experience.	-1
Hard to use	-1
I lost count years ago of how many of these I have been through. Good ones only last a year and a half at most. Every time I purchase a new one I have to return at least the first purchase. The quality control on these sending units is as bad as any product I have ever owned. I like the gauges but am sick of having to replace the oil pressure sending units. The last couple have failed just beyond the warranty. I've had no problems with the Auto Meter water temperature sending unit.  The application is a 1994 Cummins 12 valve diesel. I have tried what others suggested to run an external ground wire and replace the teflon tape but these modifications made no difference. I have followed tech support's instructions to check all of the wiring and have even replaced it. The sending still provides a signal when the oil pressure is over roughly 70 psi but quits below 60 psi. This is what they all eventually do whether brand new out of the box, a month old, or over a year old.  If anyone can suggest a higher quality replacement from a different brand I am looking to avoid Auto Meter for any future oil pressure sending unit needs.	-1
This is the fourth one I've bought due to the others breaking.  When I got my car, it had one on it that failed.  I bought one (#2). The second one made it a few months.  Since I was under time constraints, I just bought another after that one failed in a few weeks (#3).  At this time, I was wanting something else, because this is getting stupid, but again, I put it off, and didn't have time to mess with it, so got another (#4).  Of course, it failed DURING my race.  Yes, being a moron, and putting it off until the last second again, I got another (#5).  It failed.  I don't know if they have manufacturing issues or what.  I even tested by shorting the lead to the housing (with a gator clip) to verify that it was not a housing grounding issue, like so many others have experienced, and the gauge worked fine, and I had proof the grounding was fine.  Every new sender worked initially, then crapped out.  Startup pressure on my system is ~75 PSI, and running is ~45-50 PSI, so I know I'm not exceeding the sender's capability, and I know the oil is clean and not clogging up the unit.  AWFUL.  There is NO EXCUSE for this type of failure, THIS many times.  Update:  I called Autometer, and spoke with someone in tech support (got right in, no waiting, nice guy on the other end).  He stated that they have had issues with some vehicles and certain harmonics that caused failures of the senders.  He recommended remote mounting the sender.  He was sympathetic, but that was the only solution he had.  I didn't want to buy ANOTHER sender (would have been #6!) and I didn't want to do a "remote mount" for the sending unit, because that's not acceptable.  I got some time, so I bought a VDO Vision series mechanical gauge, installed it, and haven't had any problems with it.  I wish I had done that initially, instead of doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result (...isn't that what they call "insanity"?).	-1
Pleas off easily periodically and look ghetto	-1
Nope, junk!!	-1
This peel and cling is matte almost nothing is visible.	-1
This was extremely difficult to install. It did not stay on the window. Followed all instructions and even purchased the spray and kit to install. Very disappointed!	-1
With only 400 miles on my brand new Backdraft Cobra which comes with an Auto Meter sender, it failed and of course very inaccurate fuel level indications. I bought this replacement and probably should have bought all of them in stock due to their short life. Other owners I spoke with have had the same problems.	-1
I am currently not impressed with this item. After installing per the manufacturer's instructions, I found the the insulated bolt connection at the top of the mounting plate tends to leak. I am not sure how to address this. I was considering applying some form gasket or other sealant. I am not sure if I would buy this again. If you purchase, plan some time for trial and error.	-1
Terrible can't see out of window	-1
the arm with the float not included	-1
This was put on by a former tint guy, and it's cloudy. I suppose its OK if you just need something quickly, but real tint is by far better.	-1
garbage.	-1
The peel and cling part is good but if you're not ten feet away from the installation you'll be looking at blurred and distorted objects.  If it's window you're going to be looking through regularly you probably want a more optically clear solution.	-1
The film was damaged. Unusable.	-1
I was able to do a side window without too much headache but the back window is where you'll be throwing in the towel.  Unless you install window tint for a living or have someone who does helping you.. All the patience and youtube videos in the world can't help you. You're wasting your money. Real window tinters will tell you too that Gila is very low quality film and is hard to work with (even for them) and it WILL turn purple in a few years.  Just go get your windows tinted professionally if you really want them tinted.	-1
Many of the other reviewers are okay with the lack of visibility due to it being a thicker piece of film. However, if you plan on seeing anything outside the window clearly and be able to read signs and make out distinct objects, then you should not purchase this window tint.  I had put the film on the driver side window around 2pm in the shade. It was a clear day. After I finished putting the film on. I could hardly see or make out addresses in the neighborhood because the film was so blurry. I don't want to imagine how it would fare during the evening. A very big safety issue.  Other thoughts: It being thicker than average tint, the film was very hard to shape and cut.	-1
I have MSD Ignition systems on all my vehicles and I have been happy with them.  All the vehicles have MSD 6A multiple spark discharge systems, so I know the coils take a beating.  They do fail after 80-100k miles, so I carry a spare coil with me.  No problem, that is to be expected on any vehicle with a hotter than stock ignition system.  This is not my reason for a poor rating.  I had the MSD part number 8226 fail on my 1992 Chevrolet, so I ordered a MSD part number 8226 as a replacement.  The current 8226 is NOT the same as the old 8226!!!  I took a picture of the old and the new side-by-side, you can see they are the same part number but are different parts.  Yes, MSD does include some extra metal bracket pieces to mount up to the stock bracket.  However, this shifts the position of the coil over about a half inch.  Mount the coil on one side and it is up against the intake manifold and cannot be bolted to either of the mounting holes.  Mount the coil to the other side and it presses up against the distributor and is only held down by one of two bolts.  I understand this is a 20+ year old application.  However, if MSD has decided to discontinue a part, I do not understand why they did not also discontinue the part number.  Using the same part number causes errors in all the parts catalogs out there - including Amazon.  The old 8226 part fit, but the new 8226 part does not.  I strongly encourage you to carefully examine your vehicle for fitment before ordering this new design 8226 coil as the online "This fits your vehicle" parts lookup tools are inaccurate.  I have ordered an Accel coil which looks like the OEM style instead and am returning the MSD coil.	-1
It was blue ish. Not sure If i had the option to pick a color.	-1
didn't stick worth a damn.	-1
Buy it now will be replacing it again later, buy the OEM original coil instead save time and money. Trust me from a daily mechanic.	-1
Crap! Don't bother	-1
Tint seemed ok at first.  I tired to tint my windows on my Jeep but finally gave up and got it done professionally.  The tint shop left a scrap piece in my floorboard and I compared it to this tint.  The 3m tint they used is thinker and feels better than this.  But I think it would of still been ok on the Windows, I don't know.  User error I guess.	-1
The Basic Gila tint, God awful. Purple and doesn't even look like it's tinted. I guess it's what you get. Had enough for two quarter rear glass on my coupe. Ripping it off. Going to try the ultra gild, the top line and try it.	-1
This film might work fine if applied by a professional, but I found the hard, sticky film impossible to work with. I threw it away.	-1
Cheap	-1
Impossible to work with and unroll. If you don't do it perfect the first time you are screwed. total waste of money.	-1
I wasn't thrilled with this tint at all. It bubbles like crazy and sticks to its self more than the window.	-1
Do not buy this piece of junk! I bought one and it worked great for a couple months then I noticed that the car seemed to be loosing some of its get up and go and I tried a couple things to no avail because usually when a coil goes they get hot and shut down, but not this one the vehicle just seemed to not have as much power especially when towing. So I though about it for a while and did some research on these coils and did not like what I found a lot of negative reviews compared to positive ones, so just on a chance I bought a new Borg Warner Select Series Coil an what do you know the car is its old self again. Then I noticed if you shook the Accel Coil a bit I could hear sloshing oil inside (not good), then I took the original stock coil which I still have and shook it and did not hear any oil sloshing around. So this is yet another bad review for the Accel Super Stock Ignition Coil!	-1
I couldn't decide between 2 am 3 star for these reasons... 1. This coil comes a crappie mounting bracket.  I cut my old bracket off my stock coil to mount this one appropriately.  2. The most important statement!  This coil is better performance than a stock one; with that said, this coil Will fry the ignition control module within minutes due to excessive heat build up.  The way to avoid this issue is to use Quality parts such as AC-Delco for your ignition module.  I burned out 2 BWD brand modules in minutes;  then replaced with a Delco brand module and have had no issues since.  Finally with all that said... this coil pack kicks a** and with quality GM parts in the ignition system one should see a power increase and gas mileage increase.	-1
This doesn't last very long & it's very messy if your a neat freak like me. The gel last 10x longer & looks better. This product was easy & fast.  The price was good & shipping was fast The product is okay, I only recommend if your looking for a fast easy shine that doesn't last very long.	-1
from purchase date upon testing resistance didn't measure up to my other Accel coils I bought 2years earlier,it measured the same as stock,5.7K on secondary 1.7 on Primary, coil body was slightly larger anyway coil failed a 2 weeks later, they are not the real mc coys, but look the same	-1
Works if your windows are flat or slightly curved.  This film doesn't heat shrink so if you have more than slightly curved windows, you're out of luck.  Worked fine on one of my windows because it was only slightly curved, but wouldn't stay on flush on any other window.  Ordered 2 boxes, only opened 1, but it came with some creases in the middle about 3ft in.	-1
Lame, DO NOT buy the add-on, rear window tint. It is only 6 inches wide by 26 inches long. You literally can't tint anything with this. This was a total waste and an absolute sham for the price. Careful of what you are buying	-1
The shipping box was fine, but the tint box was crunched and there is crease damage on the tint.	-1
Not too strong, not too dark, ii could not use it	-1
