Works as advertised. Great!	1
I works perfectly, but the first died after 8 months and the second after 3 months.	-1
I have tried everything to deter deer and these really work.  I have had mine for 4 years.	1
I have had 4 scarecrows for a couple of years. There a couple of things I have learned, replace the battery's at least every month and a half. The replacement parts for the top plastic water flipper can be found at Walmart and Lowe's in either plastic or metal. The same is true of the bottom plastic stake portion with the hose connections.  The parts are in stand alone sprinklers, you just have to disassemble the sprinkler pieces and switch them. I have not found a replacement for motion activator.	1
Great for guarding Koi ponds from Heron and other birds.  Runs on 9v batteries.  The only bad feature is that it is difficult to replace the 9v battery since it goes in from the underside.	1
Works as advertised! No issues with animals eating my garden.  Great tool!  Kids like to play with it too, but not stury if hit.	1
I have three on my property.  Two guard an 18 roses and the other guards my large raised flower bed.	1
I had the same problem as another reviewer:  the hose and tube connections are cheap plastic and they just strip with continued use.  It is a lawn sprinkler which means that it would be expected to be moved when the grass is cut and yet it seems like it isn't robust enough.  I've returned my original one and will try again, including with some teflon tape as another reviewer suggested.  Otherwise, it works as advertised.  The sensitivity adjustment is a great feature but it does have a "safety mechanism" in that if there is a persistent trigger of the device, it goes into standby for a period of time (think a passing rainstorm that would be triggering all the time).  I had no problem keeping it in the ground although I think the insertion and removal may be a reason for it wearing out.  So again, another reviewed suggestion of inserting a PVC pipe in the ground as a holder is a good one.  I think it would be nice if the head could be adjusted downward more.  With good water pressure, it's always shooting pretty high.  Haven't seen whether this affects the behavior of the deer!	-1
Worked great, very functional.	1
This Scrarecrow Sprayer keeps the mule deer from eating our roses.  It really does the job. We have used all kinds of deer repellents and they only work if the deer aren't that hungry otherwise they munch our plants anyway...including some of our supposedly deer resistant ones! However, it is very sensitive and sprays at birds such as California quail(which don't harm the plants) and when it is very windy it will also spray.  The spraying during these situations is constant and since CA is in a drought it is probably not a good idea. In other words, if you are not in a drought area and want something that really keeps animals from disrupting your landscape this works. I just wish it was a little less sensitive.	1
Love mine, bought one for my Dad having critter problems.  Keep it on all summer until harvest without any critter problem.  We are heavily populated with deer and they hate the noise and the water spray.	1
Squirrels were demolishing my tomatoes until I put this sprinkler up.  It WORK GREAT!  I use it to guard 2 raised garden beds in my small yard.  It can be set to as broad or as narrow of an area as you need.	1
This year has been the worst.  Raccoons, 'possum, and couple deer raided our 100 tree Fuyu persimmon orchard.  Set small game traps & caught couple of possum.  Fresh urine and mothballs was good for only 1 night.  Figured we try the Scarecrow.  Bought 2 of em, set em out, and focus the Bushnell trail camera on the area.  Sure as the sun comes up here come the raccoons.  BAM. Set off the sprinkler and got that deer in the headlights look before running like the dickens.  Next night BAM - Run.  3rd and succeeding nights nothing come for a midnight snack.  Just moved to another part of the orchard. Bought 2 more to cover another section.  Now there's just a small area that's not covered.  Next spring will purchase 2 more which will give blueberry field complete coverage than move to orchard in the fall.  GREAT PRODUCT.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.	1
Scares the heck out of critters. Raccoons hate it.	1
so far its working	1
This is so cool, motion sensor knows when the critters are coming to your flowers and gives them a shot of water like a rotating sprinkler.  I use it for my perennial beds.  It doesn't cover a huge area though and if you want to work in your planting beds you better turn it off or you will get wet too!  We were covering a 10x12 area with one.  The only thing is that it is sensitive and if you have wind and plants with large stems or leaves they will set it off too when they move in the wind.  It works on rabbits and deer.	1
works but batteries need changing 3-4 weeks	1
I purchased this item to prevent ground hogs from eating up my garden. I followed the instructions and where the hose meets the "Scarecrow" it leaks. I purchased gaskets from the big box store and same results. We left it on leaking but the animals were not deterred by the water. The oil man got soaked and didn't appreciate it so it does function. This expensive item is now in the shed.	-1
Works good to keep Blue Heron's away.	1
Amazing product. It kept deer away from flowers and vegetables.  The deer do not even come into the yard now.	1
Works good, just remember to turn off water when mowing.	1
Works very well! If I had a bit more water pressure it would work much better at scaring off the geese on my lawn. The decals of the scarecrow fade from the sun in about a week. But been using it for a few months and have not changed the battery yet. Need to get another one because one does not cover enough space for me. Can only get about 20ft from it...	1
Oh man, this thing works great to keep my cats away from an area in the yard that I don't want them in. It triggers in all light levels and keeps the critters away. It was also very easy to set up.	1
Great for blasting the neighbor and his cats. My neighbor's cats are always pooping in my backyard. They have a favorite spot and it stinks.  When I first installed the Scarecrow I did not have it calibrated and it was in "full douche" mode. I even blasted myself while testing the thing. Anyway, I leave it on and go inside. The next thing I know is my nosy neighbor is banging on my front. I open the door and he is going off on me about something. I couldn't figure out what he was so upset about. Then I realized he had been looking over the fence trying to figure out what the Scarecrow was doing there.  The range finder picked up on his movement and blasted him with a major "douche." Talk about poetic!  I have had the Scarecrow in for about three weeks now and it works great. The only drawback is don't forget to turn it off if you work in the backyard because once you are in  range it will get you!  Just ordered another one.	1
Works pretty well to scare the cats away from the garden.	1
Acted erratically at first until i figures out that my patio shade cloth was setting it off when the breeze blew.  I repositioned it and it works great.	1
This was a great idea and it has a very sensitive sensor. It was easy to set up and adjust the range of area you wanted to spray water on. If you work in the garden, as I do, you should be aware of where you are in relation to where the scarecrow sprays water or else. I learned the hard way. I didn't give it 5 stars because I would've liked it to work at night when some deer have their midnight snacks.	1
I had to return this item. Only because I changed my mind.	1
Bought to deter raccoons from pond, owned for 4 years.  The item sprays a substantial stream but is difficult to aim at a low enough height to be effective against short animals. Additionally, raccoons in particular quickly learn how to avoid stream and time their raids such that the unit is USELESS AGAINST RACCOONS. (Note the unit has a refractory period where it resets and won't discharge).  Raccoons get into pond and its business as usual for them after that. Deer and cats which dislike water and are easily spooked are deterred.  Raccoons are not at all.  People who say it is helpful for raccoons haven't used it for very long I guess. Unit is advertised as effective against raccoons and I purchased for that purpose, gets 2 stars since ineffective. Some utility against deer and cats.	-1
Works as described.	1
What a Shame.  It worked great for two months, and then it quit working.  I replaced batteries about every 3 weeks.  It's a really neat idea, but it's not much good if it doesn't work.	-1
Works well until your plants get tall.  Just plan on sinking it into a pot of 'concrete' that you may be able to lift to a small table later on for added height.  (The Scarecrow can't see around those big tall corn stalks, ya know!:)  Or maybe get a couple of them to point into the center for a more protected area!  Other than that tiny consideration, it has been great.  LOVE IT.  Highly recommend!	1
works great and even scares me when I forget about it. the little chip in side has a random spray time when it's triggered a few times in a row. It needs an on switch so you can use it to water.	1
Works well but there are some flaws: head stopped rotating. I was able to fix it by applying some grease.  Still notice a bit of friction and am sure it will wear off at some pt. sensor doesnt always fire consistently. (edit; It didn't take long for the head to jam.  Looking for a similar but higher quality product) Battery wears out without much warning and when it does it just doesnt stay on as long  It does seem to deter the awful deer around here though.  We had some trees cut down and in doing so, had to remove this thing.  I forgot it unplugged and all my tomatoes were eaten and trampled through. In spite of the flaws it works well and I wouldnt mind getting another to cover more area in the yard.  Especially the nosy neighbor next door that likes to walk through my yard when we aren't home!!	-1
I've used it for a couple of weeks and it keeps the deer away. It is easily activated by my cats and goes off quite a bit. I turn it off in the day time, but can hear it clicking whenever I walk though the yard. So far the batteries have not run down. It is probably worth having to replace batteries often. The only thing to keep in mind is that it only takes one night of not being turned on to lose all your Hollyhocks!	1
Keeps the deer off of my Hydrangea trees! Love this little bird - it even scares me when I forget that it is there. It scared away a blue heron from eating my mom's koi too. It is superb for protecting your yard from animals you can't kill, or don't want to kill, but who are destroying everything you enjoy.	1
I have a yearly problem with Canada geese covering my yard with stinking poop as they eat my grass. I bought this device even after the poor reviews and noted issues. First, I had no water leaks at all after a firm twist to connect parts. The 9 volt battery worked for more than a month. Now the bad news. The presence of the geese in the field of coverage by the device was insufficient to trigger the sprayer. It is possible that the geese do not have a strong enough heat signature to trigger it. A passing car would set it off when on the highest sensitivity, but no setting or re-aiming or repositioning would cause it to spray the geese when present. So all in all, it was a failure for my intended purpose of geese abatement.	-1
Great	1
Works pretty well!  The sensitivity is a bit tricky to get set, but it works.	1
Great! No garden thieves since I put my two pack up. One must have sprayed meandering bear. Neighbor said bear in the back yard about 1.5 minutes. Knocked the device down and ripped some dripper lines. Still works like a champ! We love it.	1
Love it, keeps the neighborhood cats out of the backyard; as well as a few friends who accidently walk within range.  Don't think the mailman likes it, as well as the neighbors when their mail is wet.	1
Used them successfully for a number of years to help discourage semi-feral cats in the neighborhood from hanging out in the area around and below our backyard bird feeders. They operate on 9-volt snap-top batteries. The spray pattern may be adjusted from narrow to about 105 degrees and the trajectory may be adjusted as well. In our usage we found that with the frequency with which cats (and squirrels) activated the sprinkler, battery life was shortened a good bit. Nevertheless an interesting and non-harmful deterrent to animals that may be startled by the sound of its activation and the 3-second, pulsating water jet.	1
Worked very well on geese at the dock and deer in the yard.	1
we have about 10 windchimes placed around our s florida home. this one i put at the front enterance way. it is very attrative and well made like all woodstock chimes. doesn't take alot of wind to create a nice gong.	1
Totally Class Outfit!  Fast shipping, easy set up, problem was, it didn't work.  The valve was defective.  Dreaded calling them, figured it would be a long wait to talk to someone who doesn't speak English.  Nope, fast connection, Folks are in Canada, so no language problem.  Explained issue and what I'd done.  I was thanked for reading the instructions and setting it up right.  They are sending me another one, 3-5 business days, no charge, and I can keep the original for parts or whatever.  I was able to check sensitivity by setting it up and walking around the garden, very loud "click" when the valve activates, easily heard.  Called the dogs over and one of them walking down a garden row was detected.  If it will pick up a dog at 15 feet, it will definitely "see" a deer!  When I first assembled the unit and instaled the battery (make sure you have "good" alkaline 9V batteries) I was amazed to find the battery connector was pre lubed for the battery?  That is class!!!  Told all my gardening buddies, definitely recommend this for Kritter Kontrol....	1
I bought this unit in order to scare a Blue Heron away from my fish pond. I may never know if it gives him a scare, but I can attest it does detect the presence of a warm body (it is a heat sensor) and the jet of water produced by the sprinkler is sufficient to scare the devil out him. There are a couple of cons. The plastic washers furnished in the hose connections should be replaced with compressible rubber ones, and the hose connection needs to be modified to be a normal rotating female connection as is found on most, if not all, garden hoses. Other than that it is a good unit. Had I purchased it some time ago I'd most likely have quite a few more fish than I do.	1
So the install was a pain because as another person said, it's cheaply made.  I had to stop, go out and buy washers because the thing leaked.  Also, would it have killed them to put a tightening collar on it?  It's a total pain to deal with the hose attachment if it's already in the ground - and that alone wasn't easy either.  I'm disappointed, though, in it's range.  I set it on 9, the most sensitive from what I can tell, and it detects nothing unless you're 5 ft away.  If I can't make this work any better, then we'll be sending it back.  Edit:  While all of the above stands, for some reason, it did keep the chickens away but now they've figured a way to scoot around it, especially when the battery goes dead in the middle of the night.  It is totally undependable.  The garish yellow stickers faded in no time and it's not even in bright sunlight.  It's in the shade.  It runs through batteries like crazy.  If you use it, stock up on 9V batteries.  Edit: 20 August, 2014  I gave it a bit more time and things went downhill quickly.  It appears to be defective.  It goes off CONSTANTLY even when nothing is there.  That's when it's set on 9.  On 8?  Nothing happens at all.  It never goes off.  It also dribbles and makes a muddy mess at the base, thus the area where the stake is becomes mushy and the stake then falls over.  Also, it goes through a battery every 5 days.  Not acceptable.  It is useless in hot climates.  It's infrared, and not really 'motion sensitive'.  It is triggered by heat, not movement,  and when we have 90+ degree days, well, there is no differential between the hot air and the heat of an animal.  I would like to return it but they only give 30 days to return.  That doesn't give time to evaluate it and to see if it holds up at all.  I'm very unhappy.	-1
Well, I am very glad I made this purchase.  This unit works very well, gosh it does scare the animals away.  I now have no dug out holes in my garden and my vegetables are  undisturbed.	1
This works better than any electronic device to repel pooping cats and dogs. Especially cats, because they do not like water. Once they have been sprayed and hear the clicking sound, no more cat poop! It also wets down Pesty door to door sales people.	1
My one year old lab likes to get in my garden and eat my plants.  I tried fencing and mothballs but nothing worked until I got this.  After a few weeks, he doesn't even get close to the garden.	1
My husband spent a whole weekend building a good fence with a 1ft deep trench.  We were sure nothing could get in there. I planted all my plants I had grown from seeds: tomatoes, peppers, celery, lettuce, broccoli, kale, cauliflower, cucumbers, spinach.  Also some strawberry and raspberry plants I bought and radishes and carrot seeds. All my broccoli, kale and cauliflower got eaten.  I first thought they were slugs or caterpillars so I bought new plants and sprayed them with a natural solution against bugs.  The following day all my newly plants were gone...this time I noticed that while some only had the stalk left and all the leafs were gone, others were actually pulled out of the ground.  No bug could have pulled my whole little plants out of the ground.  Even my spinach, lettuce, squash, radishes and zuccini plants got eaten! So then I figured it was squirrels since nothing else could get into our garden.  I bought fox pee and another spray that is supposed to sting when eaten.  I planted all my plants TWICE more and each time they were gone within 2 days. I bought more plants for the last time when I found this sprinkler and hoped for the best. I have a huge garden so the sensor does not cover the whole length it covers most of it.  And it works!  It's almost been 2 weeks and most of my plants are still there.  The only ones that got eaten were the ones outside of the sensor range. My only advise is to be careful when planting very small seedlings near the sprinkler since it's pretty strong and might damage any weak plants.	1
We have had some type of animal digging in our Garden. Set this up last night. Called my 10 year old son to check out our new sprinkler. He was looking at it and got soaked. Wife did find paw prints in the garden.  Update 6/20/2012 What ever has been tearing up our garden has not been back in a couple of days. So as far as I can tell it works very well.	1
Thru a newly installed IP camera i find a Raccoon not only going after my pond fish but also taking a swim in the pond. The sides are straight up and down so he can't walk into the water he just jumps in. I covered the pond with netting and the Raccoon would walk around on top of the netting until he forced it down and he was able to once again play in the water. I found this item at Amazon (lowest price) and set it up. For four nights the Raccoon did not show up. Last night he did, he walked by the scarecrow and he got a blast of water and took off like a rocket. It was pretty funny to watch. Good product.	1
It worked like a charm.  Because the whole thing is made of plastic, you really have to be careful when you attach or detach it from your hose.  It looked like it could break easily.  After several months, it had stopped working.  I called the company and they showed me how to clean it (which you have to do regularly, especially if you have sediment in your water or if you have hard water).  After that, it worked as it normally did.	1
I was looking for something to stop the deer from eating everything in sight and was tired of trying to remember to spray a repellant after every rainfall.  Purchased this item along with the Orbit 62001 timer and now all of my plants are protected.  Considering the initial investment compared to the cost of sprays to repel deer and other animals this is a no brainer and does not involve me doing anything after initial set up.  I set timer for two 6 hour cycles during evening, through the night till late morning to spray any animals.  It is programmed to not come on during the day to avoid spraying forgetful me or the mailman.  Well worth ever penny compared to cost of just one shrub plus cost of deer repellant for one season. Oh one more thing.  I no longer deal with the nasty smell of the animal spray repellants	1
We live in an area where there are lots of deer and elk.  One neighbor feeds them, so they use our yard as a shortcut to his.  Meanwhile, we're avid gardeners.  Deer will eat anything once, even things they aren't supposed to like.  So in desperation, we bought a SCARECROW.  It works great for quite awhile.  We heard that the animals will eventually get used to it and find ways to sneak around the spray.  So my genius husband got the bright idea to hang 3 sets of old wind chimes where the spray will strike them as it is triggered by the animals motion.  The added noise has kept them completely at bay.  We died laughing one day as a 300 lb elk got caught by surprise, hit by the spray and startled by the loud noise, he dug a huge divet in the earth making a panic U-turn to run the other way.  No more intrusions by that section of the property.  We just purchased 2 more for the other areas.  It's a great invention.  Just don't forget to turn it off before YOU walk by....it's gotten me a couple of times.	1
I like the concept, but like previous reviews it's made of cheap plastic.  I replaced the 0 rings and used plumbers tape.  Spent like an hour trying to stop the leaks...  It's still drips, but l can live with it for now... It does keep the ducks away from my pool, but I would have bought another higher quality product if i could.	-1
Just remember to check the battery!  The battery doesn't last long if you have a lot of things triggering it, like I do!  I was deer free until the battery died, my fault.  One night of a dead battery and they ate all of my peas!	1
So far: no deer in the garden. No elephants either. The sprinkler activates too often, even though the sensitivity knob is turned back a bit. I had to use teflon tape to make it stop drip-leaking at the fittings. My garden is about 40' X 50' and I really need one more sprinkler. For now, I am assuming that the deer are not interested in my potatoes.  Three months later: This device loves 9 volt batteries. When the voltage drops below 90%(about 8.25 volts), it quits working. I'm on my third battery for this nearly-ended growing season (Still protecting my peas).	1
I bought three of these to keep a local skunk out of our lawn before he/she manages to dig out all the grass.  The PIR sensors inside the scarecrow barely detect a skunk - it's too low and slow to set it off unless its within a few feet of the sensor. However, the sensors do a great job of picking me up to 20' away. When an object is close, the water won't hit it, even on minimum range settings. What few drops are hitting the skunk, he/she simply shrugs off and keeps digging / eating.  This 'scarecrow' works better repelling squirrels since they seem to set it off more easily (hopping through the grass) and because they seem to mind the water more.  I like how the sprinkler head can be adjusted for range and scope of rotation (360 degree vs. a smaller sector, etc.). That allows you, within limits, to fine tune the area of coverage. The smaller the area of coverage, the more effective the scarecrow is, since the pest will be hit repeatedly as the stream whisks back and forth in a narrow arc. But that only works for alleys or other narrow confined approaches, not a open field.  Another nice feature is how you can daisy-chain these scarecrows. The bottom has an inlet and and outlet that is usually covered with a cap. They even include sealing rings, so there is no leakage. However, I am not impressed with everything being made of plastic. The thing is fragile, as emphasized in the manual - no pushing, pulling, etc. on anything plastic other than the stake and then only around the garden hose fittings. For example, I accidentally dragged a hose across the top of one unit and the plastic distance dial popped right off.  For $50+ I expect better and its claimed efficacy re: skunks is not borne out in my experience.	-1
I added teflon to the water connections,  and still leaked but the sensor would not work with the water on.  Dry test worked fine i would hear the click.  But once I added the water and did nothing.  My home is a 1990s house with great water pressure and this device was just terrible.  I also tried the havahart water auto sprinkler and both are great in theory but are terrible on real conditions.	-1
The deer were murdering  couple of newly planted roses this Spring and all the repellents and whatever didn't phase the deer. This unit stopped them cold. My only problem is I really need several to cover all the roses on my 5 acre home site. I have been moving the one unit periodically and it seems to help but a full time unit is better than a trained pit bull. I get blasted myself if I stray too close while mowing the lawn or putting out the garbage. If you need deer and other intruder protection I highly recommend this produce. Probably good for cats and dogs as other reviewers have reported.	1
No leaks, easy to assemble and adjust, low profile, and works perfectly to guard our large pond  !!!  This scarecrow is a replacement for a previously purchased more expensive brand which leaked new out of the package.	1
I've had this thing for a year and if it broke, I'd buy another.  Our dog, who I love, had previously dug up everything my wife planted.  Getting rid of the dog was out of the question.  My wife was ready to give up on her garden when I purchased the "scarecrow motion activated sprinkler" and the digging stopped.  As a bonus, the deer laid off of my nearby grape vines.  The wife got tomatoes and I got wine.  It's made of flimsy plastic but has lasted a full year so far.  I just put it out for the summer and it worked fine after storing it without a battery for the winter.  It's already run the dog off multiple times and I expect it to keep the deer at bay.	1
I simply do not understand the reviews that say this is hard to put together!  It is so simple. I have owned several of them over the years and they work great keeping my chickens out of my flower beds during the day and the deer out at night. I do agree with a small leakage problem that is easily solved by getting washers at the hardware store and installing them before hooking up the hose and not turning your water on full blast but just enough. I ruined two of my units the first year because I left them out when we had a very cold night and the water froze and busted the plastic.  Just remember to unhook and bring them inside in cold weather. Also, yes, you will forget about it once in awhile and walk by it and get sprayed. This definitely will make you laugh at yourself !	1
I have many fruiting trees that must be protected by birds and squirrels.  This motion sensor product is a great item to thwart those pesky birds from eating my persimmons, cherries, and other fruiting trees.  A relative has a motion sensor device to protect koi from predator birds.  Sometimes those little birdies want a fish or fruit meal; however, motion sensor instruments are a tremendous method of eluding their dietary desires.	1
One of the few things that I have found that keeps deer away from my roses. The only issue is leaking at hose connection. I have tried numerous different types of gaskets and hose fittings, but it always seems to leak. I try to keep as little pressure in the hose as possible, just enough to allow a good spray when activated.	1
Works as advertised, great has kept the rabits and deer away from the garden. I would strongly recommend this product to anyone who has pest problems in the garden or yard.	1
I set these motion sprinklers up in our gardens at night to scare the deer when they visit.  We do not have a fence, and these sprinklers really work well at scaring the deer away. The noise startles them, and I don't think they like getting wet.  The sprinklers have been reliable, and the 9 volt lasts for most of the summer.  A little difficult to regulate the arms motion, but nothing too bad.  I certainly recommend this product to keep deer away.  It works for us.	1
I bought one of these last year to keep my dogs off of a patch of dirt that I was trying to get some grass seed sprout on and it worked great until I broke it.  I had another patch this year and bought a second pair of these and plan to be more careful with them.  The only reason I docked a star is because I can't seem to tune the sensitivity of the motion sensor- it is either too sensitive, too sensitive, too sensitive, too sensitive or non responsive.  This is not a deal breaker as I just placed them in a way that it doesn't matter if they are too sensitive.  As an FYI, if you are wondering how long the charge on a 9v lasts for one of these (not included, BTW), the answer is insanely long.	1
i put this on the grass to keep the deer away. well that dident work i looked outside and the deer were laying about 2 feet away from it and a bird was sitting on top of it. u may want 2 look for something else.	-1
OK, my sons dumb dog kept dragging my firewood around the yard.  I gave this a try to train him to stay away from the stack of wood.  It worked.  After a few times of getting wet he stayed away from the stack.	1
Raccoons were tearing up my lawn every night. I didn't want to trap them because they MUST be euthanized due to the fact that relocating them could spread disease, like distemper, to other areas. It is easy to set up. Adjustments to the spray arc and distance are easy, as is adjusting the movement sensitivity. Haven't had a single hole dug by the raccoons since I started using this. Just make sure you have a nine volt battery because it doesn't come with one.	1
Bought this to keep my chickens away from the back fence (where they have been pecking).  They quickly learned to stay away.  My husband unhooked the hose the other day and they STILL won't go near this thing.  Great deterrent.	1
We have a lousy neighbor whose 70 pound pit bull craps on our and our  neighbors lawns. Now, this lousy neighbor, "BO" (dogs name is beckley) leaves the loaf lay to be moved by our lawnmower. Now "Bo" can't read as he ignores our sign, actually thinks it's a game. I bought this honey as I didn't want to affect good neighbors dogs with a sound gizzie. First morning was wonderful!!!! "Bo" and beckley were soaking wet! The problem moved to other neighbors yards, now everyone wants one. The beauty of this thing is "Bo" can't come over and kick or jump on it without getting soaked in the process. This thing flat works!	1
Even though it's made out of plastic, it works as advertised!  It keeps away the Raccoons and Herons.  I recommend this product!	1
trying to keep my bosses huge dog away from my cats and this thing really squirts hard and fast and works well. also seems to be made well and should work for scaring away most cridders. good product	1
This has been the only thing I have found to deter birds from doing their business on our hot tub.  It is sensitive enough that it gets them as soon as they land.  I nestled it in the bushes because it is so ugly and I also left the stickers off to keep it discrete.  Only bad part was that it started leaking after only one summer.  Bummer.  I may buy another one and hope for better luck.	1
This product keeps the deer away from plants.  We also used it near the pear tree, kept the deer and the groundhogs away from our fruit.  Remember where you placed it or you will receive a shower when you walk within 25 feet.	1
I bought this to keep coons away from my fish pond and it works great.  A must have is you have a pond.	1
this was my second one, I guess I didn't learn the first time. it also died the first season.  it was great at first. then it just stopped noticing anything walking by. it also started to leak at the hose after a few weeks but if you don't leave the hose on, it doesn't work at all. I think my next plan is electric fence.	-1
Mine doesn't have the pretty decals... but the thing deters pests as advertised. I bought it to deter my neighbors tom cat from stalking my cats. He'd come in at night and lay in wait by the back door and my tom cat would freak and it'd sound like a cat fight inside my house (with a glass door separating the two cats).  The scratch marks on the glass show it'd be a serious fight if they actually met.  Since the crow has been standing guard, neighbor cat has not been seen.  Noteworthy, after a single incident with my own cats (didn't get the water turned off) now even they are leery of the backyard.	1
These were great while they were working but within a few weeks one of them sprung a leak and another got plugged up.  We have pretty hard water.  Fortunately, Amazon took them back with no hassle as all and it didn't cost me a thing.  I ended up buying something else to protect my plants from the deer.	-1
I love this thing! I've had problems with some burrowing critters getting into my compost bins. So, I decided to take a multi-faceted approach. I lined the open bottom of the bins with hardware cloth and got this scarecrow. I noticed no digging around the bins as long as I remembered to turn it on in the evenings before bedtime. The one time I forgot to turn it on, the wire lining stopped the pesky digging. I knocked this a star because the connections between the hose, the post, and the sprinkler head aren't the best, so there are major dripping/leaking issues. Forget to turn this off in the morning, and your yard will be a swamp by lunch time.	1
This has kept the herring birds and raccoons away from our fish pond.  It has also gotten us plenty of times too.,  The only drawback is that it tends to shoot the water too high for out use.  Wish that were adjustable.	1
I have used this product for two seasons now; and have been disappointed with the results. The first year it worked fairly well on large animals; but had trouble detecting smaller ones, despite adjusting the settings as the manual directed. The second year, despite fresh batteries, it was pretty useless.  Both years even the smallest gust of wind would activate it; so in effect it only worked when there was no or little wind, which was about half of the time. Next year I will be building a better fence to keep out the unwanted critters.	-1
Works exactly as explained.  Good battery life and kept animals out of area.  Doesn't help during freezing weather when deer still come to the garden.  I wonder if it could have a setting to sprinkle at timed intervals to keep water from freezing during cold spells.	1
My initial impression of this device is very good. I just planted a new front yard with Dymondia. It's a ground cover plant that requires much less water.  After installing the Dymondia I began to have problems with rabbits and crows. I did some looking around to find a solution and came accross The Scarecrow Sprinkler.  So far it appears to be working well. It does seem a little touchy on adjustments.  I will do a follow up in a few months.  So far I would recommend this device.	1
Works as advertised.  This is a well made product.  It takes some patience to get it adjusted to your situation, but I love that it is so adaptable.  By that I mean, you can adjust the sensitivity of the sprayer.  So, it can be adjusted to not spray birds but will spray the cat.  I can move this around the yard and easily readjust it.  So, once you get the hang of it, it is very easy to adjust the distance (angle of spray in height) and in width (easily adjust width of spray too).  I managed to get this adjusted to spray the neighbor's cat (who would stalk the native birds I feed) without spraying the birds.  The squirrels got sprayed until they learned this sprayer depends on horizontal movement.  So, if the jumped from the fence straight down to the ground, the sprayer did not go off.  Eventually, they gave up and avoided the spray area entirely. Oh, and I did not put the "scarecrow" decals on it as I did not want to scare the birds.	1
my second one, luv them, keeps the kittys away from pooping in my flower bed.  it really works great. buy it	1
Lifesaver for your fish. This device really works! herons don't like to get wet! You can set the spray radius and sensitivity, so it just monitors the pond. When anything comes into that perimeter this thing makes a sound like a rattlesnake as it starts spraying water left and right. The heron flies off fast! Not sure it deters raccoons, but my pond is raccoon proof. You just have to remember to turn this off before you walk past it, then turn it back on. Our first one developed a leak after the second year, so this is my second one. Love it!	1
We have an elevated bird feeder and got this to discourage pigeons from gathering underneath it to eat any seeds dropped from the feeder.  We don't really mind the pigeons on the ground, but they sit on our house roof, and the amount of pigeon poop they can leave is astounding!!  And, it worked just as advertised and was really fun to watch the pigeons scatter when it came on . . . for about a month.  Unfortunately, the pigeons gradually decided they didn't mind the noise and getting a bath so, eventually, it went the way of all pigeon deterrents -- great until the pigeons figure out they're not really getting hurt.  But, I'll probably use it next spring to keep the deer out of the flower garden, so it's not a total loss.  Now, if I could just figure out a permanent non-lethal pigeon deterrent. . .	1
We had a major problem with deer and other animals helping themselves to our fruit.  After installing 2 of these we had no further problems and the animals learned to stay away.  Our neighbor bought one to keep the cats from using her flower beds as a litter box.	1
Works well to scare any animals who happen to come close to it. In fact, it sprayed me a couple of times, too.	1
Works well as instructed; we did buy extra washers as one helpful reviewer suggested so no leaks at all.  The sound of the sprinkler being activated (and believe me, strong water comes out of it so it will scare anything away) at night, when the flea-ridden stray cat comes creeping in, is music to our ears.  We put this on one side of our yard where we know that cat comes, and the fleas have been under control (with help from pest control company too). Some funny accidents have happened (like the time I forgot to warn the pest control worker about it, I heard him scream in the backyard and we both laughed so hard 'cuz he got wet!)  I also bought the Yard Sentinel (emits high pitch sounds, motion activated) to ward off other animals (bunnies, possums).  So these 2 deterrents are helping keep my yard flea free.	1
Herons. Love them or hate them. They are beautiful and I love birds, but I have a lake stocked with koi. Enough said? The decoys, the gazing balls, and all the other heron-repelling devices are useless from the get-go or soon out-thought by the big birds with the big brains. I can't say the Scarecrow keeps them away forever but it minimally makes them wary (one wave of my hand and they fly away now, while at first they just laughed unless I was close enough to heave a rock at them).  This will more than make your investment worthwhile if you are watching a heron walk within range of the Scarecrow and see it get smacked with a squirt of water. A delightful screech and they are off (for a while). Yes, I recommend this. Buy several if you have a lake and move them around for greater effectiveness. (No doubt works well for other predators but I cannot comment from experience).	1
I like the product, the sensor works well the minute it comes in contact with a subject that crosses its path (that would be me for now) but it's hard for me to tell if I am getting results.  I live in a wooded area with lots of deer.  They come every day and more so at night, so I haven't seen any action yet.	1
...as long as it is on and activated.  If the water is off or the battery dies, the deer figure it out very quickly.  Naturally, at the end of summer the sprinkler needs to be drained, the battery removed, and the unit stored for winter.  Then the deer quickly move back in.  This means I still can't keep deer-sensitive bushes, but I can have hostas and other summer blooming flowers that the deer would otherwise destroy.  My only other (small) beef is that its range is a bit shorter than the sprinkler reaches, and it can be difficult to aim on hilly slopes.  A lot of trial and error goes into placing the units.  The help of a nephew who doesn't mind getting wet is useful in setting up the sprinklers, to be sure the covered areas overlap, as the tiniest pathway between them will be discovered by the deer almost immediately.	1
Easy to assemble, easy to set up, works excellent. Sprinkler rotates extremely fast and covers area quickly. Make sure to attach hose and put stake in ground first, then attach sprinkler head aiming in desired direction. Sprinkler is easier to position after stake is in ground.	1
I grow a lot of my own food and I keep a straw mulch of 12" on top of the soil.  I also have five cats who love to play in the mulch; moving the mulch around - revealing the seeds to the sun or they go to the bathroom in it.  Was looking for an inexpensive way to keep them out. Electric fence will work but is time consuming and somewhat costly..  When I put it up, using all the parts, it is way too high to detect cats. Not only that I couldn't get the water to spray down where it would actually hit the cats.  If you look at the picture above, the spray is "above" the cat.  That won't work with my cats - they'd just thumb their noses at it and continue on their way.  This thing has to soak them or they aren't going to leave the garden. So after fiddling with it for awhile, I finally stuck a piece off of a wooden clothespin in between the dial and the deflector and that got the spray closer to the ground.  But the whole thing is still too high.  So I checked to see if a 1/2" pvc hose thread fitting would work with the Scarecrow fittings and it did so I cut the long extension pipe down to size.  But they've made the pipe itself not a standard size - too big for 1/2" pvc, too little for 3/4" (what kind of company does that?).  So I sit there and scratch my head - looks like I will have to buy another extension pipe from the company.  But as I was walking by I looked at it and thought "Now why can't I just screw the hose into the fitting where the hose attaches, then screw that directly into the motion sensor head.  Eureka!  Victory.  So now the Scarecrow sits about 6 inches off the ground.  However, there is still another problem with the design of this product.  The hose attachment piece does not have a swivel.  So unless you put a disconnect fitting on it you are going to have to uproot the scarecrow to be able to get the hose off easily.  If I were the owner of this company I would include additional length extensions in different lengths and a swivel hose connector.  A good idea this product; but needs more forethought by the designers.  Afterall, this product isn't inexpensive really, especially if you need multiple ones.	1
I purchased this sprinkler for neighborhood cats that use my landscape as a litter box.  This item works, but the sensor is limited in width/degree detection.  You need to "aim" the sensor where you think the cats will walk.  You can adjust the spray pattern and the sensitivity which is good.  If the wind blows, it will detect the movement of the plants and spray all night long.  If you move it closer inside the landscaping, you can adjust the sensitivity.  If a cat walks four or five feet in front of the sensor, it will go off.  Cats hate getting wet. It was funny at first.  But, only temporarily.  After a month of getting wet, the cats learned to avoid the sprinkler.  You can change the location around, but now they look for the sprinkler first before they poop.  This works great on dogs that are allowed to roam the neighborhood.  If you have high water pressure, the hose and fittings will eventually leak.  Good luck.	1
Purchased this to keep cats away from my bird feeders and it works great!  Easy to set up and operate.  I did find it a little inconvenient having to attach to a hose, but worth it.  This sprinkler has sensitivity settings and I found the higher setting to be most effective on cats.  It has a fantastic range and stops the cat at about 30 feet from the feeders and the birds do not seem bothered by an occasional shower.  A bit pricy, but it was worth not finding piles of feathers under the feeders.	1
I really like how easy it is to setup and use.  I did have one unit go bad after just 3weeks, but was directed to contact Contech customer support directly who sent out a replcement.	1
The deer test my Maginot Line of Crows and then turn back into the forest. They "know" that as long as it is not freezing, it is easier to access my neighbors' shrubs [sorry Sam and Mike, ;-)  ]	1
Love this product. It certainly works but the reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is because there is a delayed reaction from the eye when you get in front of it. It doesn't set off immediately. But none the less it has certainly kept the critters out of my garden!	1
So far so good with this unit.  Works great keeping the wondering cat from pooping in my yard.  I tried the Havaheart trap, but could get the sneaky little turd factory to go in, even with cat food bait.  Leakage - None so far.  I have not had any if the leakage issues some experienced.  Put all the fitting together real tight with bare hands and nothing leaks.  Perhaps there was a redesign, because I had no need for double washers.  Spray height - Mine has an adjustment for the height of the spray.  Works as intended and will blast a cat height animal over a fairly distance.  Even if they did not take a direct hit, the peripheral spray and noise will make them think twice about returning.  Anchorage - I took a 2' piece of re-bar, pounded it into the ground and pulled it back out.  I then took the cap of the base stake where it leads out to a second hose and screwed it on the top.  I LIGHTLY pounded on that with a hammer into the pre-hole I made with the re-bar.  Took the cap off and put it back where it was supposed to go and assembled the sprinkler.  Worked fine.  I pounded the re-bar in beside the sprinkler assembly once it was in place and and ran a couple of wire ties around for stability.  Rock solid.  I had the re-bar and wire ties at home, so I bought nothing extra to make this work fine.  It's about 1/2 the price of some fancier models that I'm sure work just as good, But I'm trying to spend as little as possible to get rid of a problem someone else created.  Fortunately my wife has a soft spot for strays, otherwise the cat may have had a different future had I not found this sprinkler.	1
I purchased this to keep the critters our of my tiny fish pond.  My dog and I got thoroughly wet testing it.  ;)  I works great.  JUST DON'T FORGET TO TURN IT ON.  The one night I forgot to turn it on, and the racoons got all my goldfish.	1
We had a little trouble getting them set up (we have 4 of them) and the timer to work, but once my husband got the kinks out, they kept the deer out of the yard. My husband set them up in a row along the ditch at the edge of the yard (their entry point) and pointed them down so that the deer would get hit in the face. Just wish we had them before the deer ate so much of our garden.  Next year I may get to harvest some string beans!	1
The swoosh sound of the water is enough to get the deer moving fast.  The sound is not the only this that scares deer, they also  avoid the startled shock of water coming their way.  So far it has saved my Creeping Jenny and Hostas from being eaten to the ground.  The red flashing lights I purchased before these motion activated sprinklers did not have any affect in scaring the deer.	1
We have a small 12x15 yard and a neighborhood alley cat was using it as his personal crapping ground. I had to shovel up +\-5 patties every time I went out there.  Ever since I installed this sprinkler there hasn't been a stir in my back yard without the perpetrator getting blasted. I would have paid 100 bucks for this thing if I knew how well it works. Our nasty yard has turned into a nice clean area.	1
Works great, for small critters and deer or any four or two legged uninvited visitors walking around in your garden.	1
No problems with this item, but we eventually found it easier to simply go to electric fencing to cover wider area.	1
I wrote a review a couple years ago about how I used this to get my dog to stop digging holes in the same place.  It worked.  Now I have found that it is also a good tool to change potty habits in your backyard.  I had a lawn area that our large dog was marring with pee spots due to the high ammonia content in female dog urine.  The dogs were also going #2 all over, not just in a single location and it became a treasure hunt to clean up!  Simply place the ScareCrow in the area that you want to discourage your dogs from going, and they will magically migrate to other spots.  After doing this in different locations a few times they will choose the spot where you want them to go.  Greatly simplified clean-up etc, worked like a charm and completely harmless to them.	1
Only thing we have found that keeps the deer away in a selected.  Do suggest a timer is also used so it does not go off during the day and wet everyone within range.	1
It sure scares the dogs and people, let hope it works for deer.  Hard to say if it works since I'm not around and we have only had it a month. We lost one hosta but not sure if it was a deer or rabbit and it was away from the sprinkler. I would like a couple more for the dogs in the neighborhood and the walkers that let the dogs go on the grass without clean up.	1
It works great on keeping animals away from our pond.  Would highly recommend. A must have for anyone with a pond.	1
I really did not want to purchase ANYTHING,  but I have an ignorant person in my neighborhood who just lets their dog do whatever it wants, wherever it wants.  And it ususally picked my lawn because it is a beautiful lawn.  I work hard to keep it that way and was so tired of cleaning every morning after this  ignorant  persons' dog.  So, after reading reviews of the scarecrow, I decided to get one.  At one point I tried to cancel the order, but Amazon is sooo quick, it had already shipped.  I am glad.  Since I set it up, and have used it nightly, I have not had to clean after the dog or any animal.  I tried to cancel the order because I felt I did not want to hurt any animal, it is not the dogs fault the owner is irresponsible and does not leash them.  Then I realozed that it is just water, and most animals do not like getting sprayed, and it is not because they get harmed, but more like scared.  I am sure if the dog got squirted once, it will not want it to happen again.  Plus the Scarecrow makes a noise that also startles people, it startled me as I was setting it up.  Now I have a few neighbors who want to purchase one because guess where ignoramuses dog is going now......	1
I have met the Saint Simons deer.  Well, weve not been formally introduced or anything, but I have seen their handiwork.  We had just moved and all my plants were waiting for me to transplant them.  My strawberry plants were gone first.  Then it was the best parts of the blueberry bushes.  But it was the sweet potato vine in the pot near the porch that was my call to action.  I purchased one of these Scarecrow motion sensor sprinklers that will scare the deer away and installed it a few weeks ago.  Although Ive never seen it in action, I know it works.  While I was out of town moving the family down, there was some work being done at the house.  I was texting with one of the folks working around noon one day and I mentioned the sprinkler as a warning.  Shortly thereafter I received the following text from another worker, who was also at the house helping:  Hello Tom.  Thank you for the warning about the sprinkler.  I don't know about deer, but it seems to work fine on me, the carpet cleaner, and the landscape crew.  Thats how I knew it worked at first.  But, as it turns out, it's not just great on contractors!  It also keeps the deer away.  After installing it, I noticed no further damage except when I would forget to turn it on.  I use a timer with it so that it does not spray our dogs during the day.  I've been using it for several months now and it still works perfectly.  I would recommend this as a non-chemical, low cost way to keep the deer from eating your plants.  ...and as I learned it can keep people off your yard too!	1
This device scared the critter away. The problem I had was it was very leaky. Maybe we need to add an extra washer. We'll have to experiment with it. But I am pleased how alarming to critters this device can be.	1
We have a garden that is 20X50 feet.  I needed 3 of these but it does work great.  Better than the electric fences I bought.	1
I have 3 each scarecrows and it does work. I used to have cats come into my yard and do there business and not any more. I have even sprayed people with the scarecrow when the walk within range of the motion detector.	1
Okay, I got really tired of the barrage of cat droppings on my lawn EVEN after using the Havahart animal trapper.  More importantly, my son is now 30 months old and wants to play soccer which I prefer he does on grass.  Well, the only grassy area at our house is in the front and I didn't want my son to kick cat feces around either.  So I have declared war on the neighborhood feral cats in order to defend my son's feet against their fecal smelly land mines.  The Scarecrow comes in bulk packaging, which is basically a white cardboard box.  That's perfectly fine with me and will go in the recycling bin anyways.  Plus, if I can save a couple of bucks from unnecessary fancy packaging, that's even better for everyone.  I took my time putting it together (15 minutes) and that means using plumber's teflon tape on ALL water inlets.  I recommend you do this because it still leaked and I had to apply double the tape after doing a test run.  Depending on your home water pressure, I actually had to turn mine half way because even with the teflon tape, it was leaking slightly at the point where the water hose would attached to the scarecrow.  On a positive note the Scarecrow is completely adjustable.  I was able to alter the sprinkler spray spread width and distance.  Very cool.  After some trial and error, I was able to find an ideal location with the ideal settings to cover the protected area.  It's been a week and so far no cat or whatever dirty woodland creature droppings!!!  By the way, I am "protecting" my Scarecrow using Skylink HA-434RTL Long Range Motion Alert Kit.  So if anyone (aka animal or cat lover, PETA, etc.) tries to steal or sabotage my Scarecrow in the middle of the night, it will notify me.  Just protecting my small investment.  Wouldn't you?  By the way, I thought Amazon sent me a special all black Scarecrow because I was special and they felt bad not inviting me to their VINE program.  Nope.  It's the same one as pictured but you have to apply the yellow stickers.  That's good that it came without the stickers applied because I wanted my Scarecrow to have the blacked-out and stealthy look.  So unless you're putting the scarecrow against a bed of yellow flowers, I recommend saving the decorative yellow stickers.	1
Each linkage leaked possibly cause my water pressure was more than these could handle.  Also when I linked more than one together each time one triggered it would set the other ones off.  Good idea but build quality and sensor sensitivity (even when on setting 3 or 4) didn't result in what I needed to keep deer away.  I'm gonna try a more expensive solution with one of the hoseless motion activated sprinkler detergents offered thru Amazon.	-1
I ordered this product to rid my property of nuisance animals and this is one Amazon purchase I regret. As multiple reviewers have noted, this product leaks. Many reviews suggest taping and replacing the washers. That may help but, honestly why should I have to fix a brand new product. Shouldn't the manufacturer produce a device which doesn't need replacemetn parts day one? This is day two of using the product and it already stopped working. I took it in dried the housing and replaced with another brand new battery (with an expiration date several years from now).	-1
I bought these to help keep the geese and deer off the lawn at our lake cabin. Works great, but you have to remember to turn them off when company arrives! Have purchased some now for our home to keep the dog off the lawn, works great.	1
Best investment I have made in years.  Little cheezy on the plastic but works great.  We had problems with squirrels and birds eating our tomato's.  After setting this up and using mode "7" we have not had any problems with squirrels or birds.  Fun to watch the sprinkler work.  Even better when someone comes to the house and see's our garden..they walk toward it and sprinkler keeps them at bay!!!  Had a lot of close calls myself!  The squirrels don't even come near the garden anymore even when turned off.  Love it	1
does what it is advertised to do. can not ask for anyting more.  minimal water use which is a  good thing	1
This is a neat idea, if one can figure out the exact range or scope of wetness you desire. My kids and I have had our share of  range-testing and  degree of how fast one can move before becoming the object of the spray. Have fun!	1
We had a serious problem with crows in our tomatoes and watermelons. I was determined to do something about them this year. I bought one of these despite the price and set it up near the tomatoes. Wow! It sits there quietly and then Wham! It blasts for just a few seconds, long enough to scare the birds away. I make the mistake of walking into the area to snatch a ripe tomato and get sprayed. Four stars only because the shaft and ground stake are too short. The stake will work loose if not fully inserted in the ground and the shaft needs to be taller to see over the tops of the plants. I'm going to buy a second one for the melons and install it in an unused planter to give it some height. We also have the fake hawk and owl on posts at each end of the garden. I also have an old boombox sitting in the window of the garden shed that plays 70s rock loudly during the day to make noise. So far no crows and I can air guitar and disco around while picking veggies. Ha!	1
Bought 2 of them. one was fine but the other one went bad after a month. changed battery,cleaned lens to no avail	-1
A few years ago word got out in the Red squirrel and chipmunk community that I had a delectable strawberry patch in my yard.  Needless to say those little scoundrels have wiped me out every year since.  To show you how brazen they had become, last year I was pulling a few weeds when a chipmunk sashayed into the patch less than 5 feet from me and munched a strawberry down as I stood there staring in amazement. As usual, this year was no different.  Day after day I would check and find my almost ripe strawberries from the previous day were either all gone or had large bites taken out of them.  And to add insult to injury I had a new intruder - a flock of Cedar Waxwings had joined in on the feeding frenzy.  That's when I saw the Scarecrow and decided to give it a shot.  As I type this I have a bag of strawberries in my freezer and a colander of fresh ones on my counter. I realized I was dealing with some rather small critters and was afraid they wouldn't trigger the motion sensor, so I turned up the sensitivity to the highest setting.  Obviously, I have false alarms, but the worst that's coming from that is that my berries are getting a little extra water.  In reality I only have to guard against the critters for a few weeks while my June-bearing berries are ripening, so throwing a little extra water around is not a big deal.  In reality, it's possible that the critters weren't even setting the sensor off.  A good wind rustling my plants often set it off.  In either case it doesn't matter to me.  Either the critters were setting off the sensor or the sheer randomness of the Scarecrow activating from having the sensitivity turned all the way up was enough to keep the wildlife at bay while I got to enjoy some berries for a change.  The end result is that you should adjust the sensitivity accordingly. Now for a few random thoughts.  Some reviewers complained that they damaged the plastic stake after pounding it into the hard ground.  Would anyone seriously expect that they wouldn't in fact cause damage to it? Another reviewer commented that the sensor couldn't distinguish him from the neighbors dog, which was the intended target.  Come on!! Seriously?  It's a cheap motion sensor that you want to function like some high tech retina reading scanner that we may find at the Pentagon.  I'm sorry, but I can't even consider your review with any credibility. One last thing - I did burn through a 9 volt battery rather quickly, so if you need yours to be on all the time you may consider a rechargeable one.	1
So far it appears to work as advertised.  I have not seen any geese on my lawn.  Can't say it this did it, or other measures.  But it's easy and inconspicuous.	1
I am an avid gardener and I also have a family of groundhogs who live under my garden shed.  Can you see my problem?  I would walk out to my garden only to see fat groundhogs scurrying away from my tomato plants with green tomatoes.  I had to do something.  I trapped a bunch with a havaheart cage but I had so many groundhogs that one cage wasn't enough to prevent them from destroying my garden.  That's when I decided to buy two Contech scarecrows.  After strategically placing them near the groundhogs entry and escape points I no longer have half bitten green tomatoes lying on the ground.  The scarecrow makes a wonderful clacking noise when it sprays that even my wife is scared of it.  I can only imagine what the groundhogs must be thinking.  The best part about it is when the kids are outside I set up both scarecrows in the yard pointed at each other and separated by about 30 feet. The kids have a great time running by the scarecrows and getting splashed. Best kids party toy ever!	1
This is the 2nd one of these scarecrows I've purchased.  It allows me to cover more of my vegetable garden boxes.  They work well.  I just have to remember they're on sometimes or I get a little surprise myself.	1
I have tried all kinds of things to keep digging wild animals out of my veggie garden. Had seen this scarecrow at a nursery but ir was $20.00 more than Amazon.  So far it seems to Be working. No more dug up veggies.	1
I LOVE this product with one huge exception. I set it up and it worked perfectly protecting my garden from intruders. However, I have an 11 month old standard poodle puppy who LOVES water. He chases the jet stream coming from my hose. It didn't take him long to figure out how to make the new sprinkler go off. About an hour. He got caught in it once or twice and then it became more frequent. Now he runs in front of it (and through my garden) to make it go off!!! But the sprinkler itself is great. Now, to teach my dog NOT to go near it is another story.	1
This is our second one on our pond, sure keeps that old crane away. I highly recommend if your having critter problems.	1
I was skeptical that this scarecrow would deter the deer in my yard.  I'm very glad that it exceeds expectations!  I placed it facing the parts of the yard where the deer trails end.  Heard it go off during the night a few times during the first week, followed by the sound of snorting and stamping deer.  For the first time in years my yard is not a deer buffet--as a matter of fact NOTHING in my yard has been browsed this year.  So glad to finally see some perennials that I haven't seen in five years.  I have tried all kinds of things in the past to deter them and nothing works.  If you have deer problems I highly recommend giving this a try.  If only there was something for winter (besides deer netting).	1
I bought this hoping it would scare off the feral cats hunting under my bird feeders but it doesn't work and the cats walk right in front of it and nothing happens. It does work for larger animals and people. It was a waste of time and money for me.	-1
Item shipped fast. I needed something to prevent cats from destroying my entire lawn. Set up was easy and adjustments were simple. Nothing leaked. After fooling around with it for an hour with my 8yo son, we went inside and sat by the window to observe the action. I needed it to cover a pretty large area and it worked well. First the birds came and it kept every bird from landing on my lawn. Shortly afterward a cat showed up and the device detected him from over 30ft. The cat took off running. Success...! Now I can start reseeding and take back my lawn. Thank You Contech  UPDATE: I added 4 more Scarecrows to my property, total success in keeping away stray and neighbors cats. My seedlings are starting to grow and my lawn is once again starting to look great.	1
Well were about 6 weeks into the hosta growing season and Im here to say this thing works fantastic for scaring deer away. We live in a rural area so deer are not as accustomed to humans as they are in suburban ares. I think that makes a big difference when it comes to how quickly the deer acclimate to these. I also move it around from time to time so its not always in the same area. You can order small bells from amazon and place them on the sprinkler head that may also help to make more noise. Only issue Ive come across is the wind setting them off by blowing leaves around. Also its best to change batteries once a month as they will wear out quickly if there are alot of false triggers on windy days.  All in all I give it two thumbs up, its way more effective than deer repellent, soap on a stick, moth balls or anything short of a live guard dog. Ill give it a full season and post an update.	1
My daughter gave me the scarecrow years ago and it sat in my garage until a few weeks ago. I am currently replacing her rear yard fence and her idiot neighbor has a dog that started coming into her yard and relieving himself on her grass. Needless to say this women is a real jerk who takes no responsibility for her kids or pets. I remembered having the scarecrow and immediately put it in her rear yard. It has worked flawlessly keeping the little monsters, both canine and human on their own property. Her other neighbors asked me about the motion activated sprinkler, they are also having problems with the kids and dog and are now getting their own.	1
Great for stopping herons or other animals. It works very good and no herons come around or oother birds & racoons.	1
LOVE IT. fast ship. great price. Awesome sound. great product.....	1
We have deer...they  are regulars on each side of our home as they head for a greenbelt behind it.  At first we had only one "Scarecrow", but soon added a second for better protection.  We can tell if the sweet little pests have been here by their telltale tracks in our flower beds (and, of course, the missing blooms of their favorites), but the Scarecrows seem to be deterring them...no tracks!  Now, with a month's experience, we feel we're ready to recommend them to you.  At the same time we bought them, we got a large "pack" of 9V batteries, too, so when the first pair go dead (they haven't yet) we'll be prepared.  Please note that batteries do not come with the sprinklers.	1
BEAUTIFUL MUSIC	1
love it	1
This really works wonderfully!  It kept the deer and the rabbits out of my garden with ease.  So glad I bought it.	1
Wife needed replacement so we listened to the sounds and picked this one.  Very nice sound.  They are smaller than they appear in the listing.	1
my many times getting wet testing this thing proves that it works. I would buy this again if I ever need another one.	1
I was very reluctant to spend $50 on a sprinkler but I rad positive reviews on this item and decided to give it a try.  It works quite well, but I wish they used a little more metal than plastic (I feel it's fragile).  Update (5/2015):  After two year's it broke.  Leaks to a very high level (complete water flow, much greater than a drip).  Expensive solution for $25 / year.  New units in that two year time frame went from ~ $49 to $90.  Thanks, but no thanks.  Great concept just learn to build a quality unit.	-1
I would give this item 5 stars, except for one missing feature - some sort of timer or, better yet, a photocell to shut the water off during daylight hours.  We're using it (and two others) to repel deer, raccoons and other night creatures from flower gardens, etc.  During the day, we end up getting squirted ourselves, so does the cat - he doesn't like it.  There are many programmable water timers on the market, but very few can be set to stay on for more than 2 or 4 hours, instead of 10-12 needed for night pests.  After much searching, I found a model 9001D timer made by DIG Corp., and sold through Smarthome.com.  It was sale-priced at $32.61, and can be programmed for an "on" duration ranging from 1 minute to 11 hours 59 minutes.  It was difficult to track down a supplier - the manufacturer doesn't sell direct.  It's also available on other sites that claim low prices, but usually overcharge on shipping - one of them wanted to charge almost $25 for basic shipping.  I've seen blogs on this subject with people recommending other timers, such as those available at Home Depot, Lowes, etc., but in  most cases, they're wrong because of the limited "on duration" of the models they recommended.  Contech (the maker of the Scarecrow sprinkler) should offer a solution, but they don't appear to have one.  If I were redesigning it, I would put in a built-in photocell option that would disable the internal valve switching during the day - that would also save on battery life.  Being an engineer, I may just modify one of my own...	1
It was just what I was looking for and needed. Product was exactly as described above. Would recommend to others.	1
Excellent product.  Beautiful in design, nice purple color, nice sound.	1
good	1
Gorgeous sound! I love it on my front porch.	1
beautiful , sounds are suberb	1
They are great. Sound awesome would buy again.	1
Sounds beautiful... Brother and sister in law love it!	1
Love it sounds beautiful	1
Between the Scarecrow and an electric fence, and my gun maybe I can get a few tomatoes, and a mess or two of green beans. If not, fruit stand here I come.	1
It chimes in the wind,, like it's supposed to.	1
I love animals. I love wildlife. I love having animals visit my yard. However, I do not like having my flower beds destroyed! I spend a lot of time, energy, and money on growing beautiful plants and have experimented with different strategies to deter one particular type of visitor to my yard: PEACOCKS! Yes, where I live we have peafowl who freely roam the neighborhoods. They are, of course, spectacularly beautiful. I feel blessed to have them visiting my yard every day. But they can destroy a flower bed in oh so many ways, including digging up bulbs--just for the fun of it--eating freshly planted seeds, eating foliage, eating seeds on flowering plants, digging 'beds' in the soil to snuggle up in and soak up the sun, etc.  I've previously tried putting decorative--and not so decorative--fencing around the beds, with mixed results. After all, peacocks ARE birds--so they can fly! Some of them were deterred simply by the presence of the fencing, while others just hopped/flew right over it. Scratch fencing...it doesn't work well.  I tried putting chicken wire down over the soil, thinking it would keep the peafowl from digging up bulbs, seeds, and seedlings. Nope. They still managed to do it. Scratch that idea.  I also tried putting chicken wire about a foot off the ground, supporting it with posts. Total failure! The weight of the peacocks landing on it caused it to collapse. Scratch THAT idea, too.  Finally, I heard about motion activated sprinklers. Yay! After a lot of looking around I bought this Contech, set it up, tweaked its settings, and, voila!, success.  It's very easy to set up. Just put its pieces together, insert a 9 volt battery [not included], adjust its sensitivity control, adjust the sprayer to cover the exact area you want, push the unit's stake into the ground, attach a hose, turn the water on, and you're all set. You may need to experiment to find just the right sensitivity setting, but it's not a big deal. You don't want something like a car driving by on the street to trigger the sprayer. You'll also want to adjust the coverage area until you get it just as you want it. Again, no big deal.  I love this sprinkler. It's working great in terms of keeping the peafowl out of the flower bed, and since it's completely humane and non-harmful I have no problem using it.	1
The pesky little rodents enjoy digging in my garden this year, so instead of posting an OPEN SEASON ON SQUIRRELS sign (being they can't read that I know of) I decided on the Scarecrow and so far it has been working as well as possible. But it does seem to eat the juice from the 9 Volt Battery, but is well worth the cost to replace it as my life is somewhat easier now and of course Squirrel Free	1
some stupid neighbor kept walking his dog on our front lawn and so i set this motion activated sprinkler up behind a bush to give them a wake-up call.  it was too funny when it went off.  fixed that problem and then i moved it to the back to dissuade rabbits and deer from the garden.  worked well	1
It's really cool!!  So far, so good--flowers are still blooming.  Before I got the timer set up on it, I had to call and give a heads-up to our lawn care specialist to call me when he was going to come out to do an application because he would get wet.  During the warmer months, he actually might appreciate the shower.  Now that I got the timer running, I called him to say all is safe.	1
I have a lot of windchimes but these are the absolute best.  The chimes of Tuscany have a very unique sound, like no other. Well worth the buy and they last forever.  Mine have been outside for at least two years and they still look new.	1
Great melody whatever Tuscany should sound like.  Very well made and responds to the lightest wind which may be good or bad.  The mail carrier even commented on the great sounds that it produces..	1
The wild turkeys quickly learned to avoid the patch of recently-sown grass seed. UPDATE:  Used it to keep a skunk away from my little pond, after it had eaten half the goldfish, and it worked really well.	1
works great	1
Beautiful sound. Attractive product. Makes a delightful addition to my chime collection.	1
Such a sweet sound to hear in the background! It is tuned to the aria by Verdi, force of destiny. Love!!	1
I have always enjoyed windchimes, and I have been through many since they don't usually last long in the Florida weather. This one is by far the best sounding windchime I've ever owned, and the quality seems to be great. I've had it hanging in the heat and rain for several months now, and it is holding up nicely. I would definitely buy this again.	1
Great scare crows.  Rabbits ravished my yard and tried everything to get rid of them.  Traps didn't work, dried coyote urine just made my yard smell horrible.  These scare crows are a humane and truly effective way of dealing with pest.	1
Being relatively new to the Austin, Texas, area, we didn't realize that patience plants were salad for the local deer. So, one day we had beautiful, healthy blossoms on our newly planted flowers and the next all we had were stumps and a few small leaves left on each. Talk about being sad!  After a relatively detailed review and possibilities, we decided on the Scarecrow. We ordered one and two days later via Amazon Prime it was assembled, in the ground and hooked up to the hose. Aside from inadvertently squirting myself a couple of times, I got used to sneaking up on it to turn in off in the early AM and on in the PM. After a few days I got the sensitivity right and for a week have not had any problems with deer.  Convinced that the Scarecrow was the device for me, I then purchased a Gilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connector for the faucet and an Orbit 62001 Lawn and Garden Digital Watering Timer. I'll have reviewed both of these separately.  Suffice to say, I am extremely happy with the Scarecrow. It is better than any other device I can think of and, unless it breaks early in its life, will continue to receive a five-star review from me.	1
I can't attest to the fact that it keeps deer out of the garden area but I CAN state that if you break the beam you'll get soaked (kitties would too if they could talk)!!!  OK, I've had this device in place for about 6 weeks and NO deer have been into my gardens.  We turn it off during the daytime since the deer only come around in the early morning.  It keeps the battery life a bit longer since it isn't "tripping" over squirrels and cats.	1
I have always loved wind chimes, and have sets which are much more expensive. This nine chime set is my favorite.	1
Beautiful sound but the purple and red colors are hideous. I just put it out of sight so I can hear but not see it :)	1
These chimes look and sound good	1
This contech motion activated sprinkler works as described but it is a bit pricey. In order fort this device to work you have to connect the garden hose to it and leave the water on so that when the motion sensor goes off water will spray out. Make sure your water connections are tight so it does not leak. This keeps the neighbors cats from $hitting on my yard. I already invested in a cat trap so the feral cat population is more controlled now.	1
I set this sprinkler in my bluberry patch that was being ravaged by chipmonks. It might work with other animals, but chipmonks ignored it.	-1
Here how my story goes...We have renters next door to us with an absentee owner and they have 2 pets...one being a cat :-(...Our backyard was just landscaped which cost us a lot of money.  Everyday I would go out in the back and see the dirt in disarray...I would smell this horrible odor and I could not figure out for the life of me what it was.  Then I saw it.  Their cat making a mess out of my yard.  I went and bought all kinds of  items to keep this cat away...nothing worked....I was at my wits end...Then I came across "the scarecrow".  I was desperate at this point because every other product failed. Well, let me tell you, I have not seen that little brat in my yard since I put this out there.  It is absolutely amazing.  I just have to be careful not to walk in front of it as I got soaked on a few occasions already. Thank you Contech for helping me regain my sanity :-)	1
There is a cat in our neighborhood that used to spend most of his day in my backyard hiding near my birdfeeders. Before I got five of these sprinklers, he was killing several birds a day.  In the seven months I've had the rainbirds scattered around my backyard, he hasn't had a successful hunt.  Nor has he been able to spend enough time in my backyard to leave presents for my dog to find.  The sprinklers do not react to birds, but the cat hasn't figured out a way to avoid them. Each time he moves out from under a bush, he gets blasted by a rainbird.  He jumps the fence and runs away only to return the next day hoping for a different outcome. When I first installed them I had a problem with leaks, but after wrapping the connectors with plumbers tape, there have been no drips whatsoever.  I like that the water jet can be aimed high or low, so my windows remain dry when the sprinkler goes off. The water jet is pretty powerful and very loud, so be sure to direct each rainbird so you can sneak up behind it to turn it off.  Even when the water is turned off at the spigot, enough remains in the hose to give you a good soaking.  Embarrassing to admit, but both my gardener and I have been sprayed more than once. This is a solid 5-star product, but you'll need more than one.	1
For the price, I wish it had a metal sprinkler head, but at least that can be changed at any time, as it uses common pipe sizes.  A little pricey, but it does work!	1
It does do what it's supposed to do, which is spray water automatically. What it doesn't do, is what I purchased it for, which is to deter the critters (Deer, Racoons, etc) out  of my garden. It doesn't do that at all. The deer could care less. Maybe they had seen these before. Not a deterrent at all, sorry to say. Would not recommend it, except to water the yard.	-1
Great	1
Very enjoyable tones.	1
I bought a house and then found out that my neighbors were feeding a feral cat colony.  There are at least 30-40 cats.  I love cats, but not these cats.  The previous owner had a dog, which probably kept them out of the yard, but since the yard was solid dirt, as soon as the dog was gone it became a giant kitty litter box.  Not pleasant.  I tried various sprays, and none of them worked.  Putting cayenne pepper down in the worst areas worked, but was very temporary, and the stuff was getting expensive, even buying it bulk.  Creating an oil from the cayenne was less effective, though it lasted longer.  Then I saw this gadget... it's great!  The cat's test it, but eventually give up. So it works, and it's entertaining.  I've put rock down in most of my yard in the process of xericscaping, and to deter the cats (they love pooping in the mulch that was in my front yard, so that wasn't an option), and their goal is now to get to the dirt area where I plan to put grass to do their business.  They'd also love to use the raised bed gardens I've installed.  The scarecrow is even more effective now, as the cats are even more determined to get to the dirt, but the scarecrow covers this full area with spray (it does not spray over my whole yard, though movement in my yard (in about a 30'x50' area), in the direction the sensor is pointing, still triggers it.)  My only complaint so far is that it is too sensitive sometimes.  During high wind events I need to turn it off or it constantly goes off, and it's not always obvious what is triggering it (branches, etc. are obvious, but I don't always see the trigger).  This is still not enough to take a star away though.	1
I love this chime, it is attractive and sounds great.	1
Love them..even on a very gusty day sound lovely..not at all clangy	1
Outstanding value!!  Great sound when even light wind -- highly recommend this to decorate front yard or patio!!	1
Scat cat!  There should be laws against people allowing cats to roam free.  This product just works.  Only problem with it is that over time, the triggering of the sprinkler can cause it to become loose and leak, so check on it periodically.  Or maybe brace and support it.	1
We have a large garden area that is open to a greenspace. We are vulnerable to just about any critter who decides to visit. Deer have been our biggest problem followed by racoons. This device is worth its weight in gold. It works very well and we now have two of them for each side of the yard. It protects both the crops and the fish in the pond. It is better than any other method we have tried.	1
Far as I am concerned it was a TOTAL WASTE OF TIME and MONEY. The Scarecrows Just Love this thing to take a Shower in and then continue to Destroy my Beaitiful Lawn. It Might work for Cats or Dogs or other animals, but if you want it to scare ScareCrows, "Don't WASTE your MONEY"!!!!!  Totally Dissatisified with this Piece of !@%&*()$%#....  Sorry. Ken.	-1
This product not only works well, but it's also fun to watch!!, especially when rabbits, cats, or dogs come to do their business in your loan or rabbits eating your grass, this thing blast them with a burst of water before they can escape!! I love watching this in the early moring hours. Also when a dog or cat wants to take a poop in your yard and the owner of the pet just lets them do it with cleaning up behind them, this thing will blast the animal with water and they will run away from you property. Have fun watching!!	1
The second unit has worked very well. We had a family of foxes take roost near a creek in the neighborhood. Each night very late we could hear a fox making a weird noise near our house, I guess as it strolled by. Well, this took care of it. After about 10 days, we shut it off and we're guessing the fox changed its route due to this device. Seems well made.	1
Cats just love nice soft planting bed dirt. Easy digging, no grass or leaves to work around and often plenty of room so they don't have to re-visit the same spot. They are indeed tidy animals. After preparing them for this year's planting, adding all sorts of expensive amendments, every day saw new cat diggings and poop. This year the beds are off limits.  Set up the Scarecrow and not one cat visit to report yet. Well, they might of visited, but they didn't stay! I know it fired off at least once and while the water goes up some and doesn't actually hit them, it does make a sudden and fearsome noise and a lot of commotion and they want no part of that.  Once I saw a mountain lion paw mark in one of my beds, so if it chases them away that might also be a good thing. Same for raccoons at the fish pond. And it does all this humanely.  You do have to be careful to set the sensor low enough for cats and smaller animals. In the past I tilted a Scarecrow down so the sensor picked them up, but for deer or larger dogs you don't have to. With a raised bed it is easy to set up the height to just above ground level, but for a bed at ground level you might want to try setting it in a pit. You can't lean it over because it works by tracking animals walking across its path.  It does not work on critters coming straight at or away from it. My outdoor motion lights are like that. You have to spend the time to find out the direction your visitors will travel and make sure they go across its path.  The kick of the water will indeed knock it back so that it is pointed upward and this will make it useless. Really, you just have to attach it to a supporting post. I wired mine to the planter walls. I had one once that I put into a pot full of gravel and that did not work. Normal soil will not contain it either.  So, spend the time to point it correctly and secure it. I find that going up half-way on the sensitivity works fine. You just have to test your situation (with the water off).  You need a 9V battery as it does not ship with one.  Years ago I had what seems to be the same device, a gift. It broke and the company would not answer an email about buying the part (solenoid). I hope things have changed and parts will be available. I do not like throwing away a $50 item that can be easily fixed.  Hecho en China of course. Should be cheaper considering. Lost a star for that.	1
We are inundated with deer.....can't shoot them in our neighborhood, can't scare them away, but this Contech does the trick to keep them away.  Nothing else I have tried,  but this does work	1
perfect	1
I bought two of these, one to protect a rose bush from deer and another to protect a pear tree from deer and crows.  I've used them all summer and they worked for about 4 months per battery.  They have worked very well scaring deer from the rose bush and the pear tree.  The noise and spray really startles deer and they bolt away quickly.  They have also been relatively effective at scaring crows from the pear tree.  I aim it so the water sprays into the tree when the Scarecrow detects movement. However, crows are very smart and they soon figured out that they could approach the tree from the opposite side from the Scarecrow and their movement would be obscured from the motion detector by the leaves.  So, I believe the solution will be to put another scare crow on the opposite side of the tree.  With a little practice the sensitivity can be adjusted to repel the pest and not be activated by wind movement.	1
I bought this unit last summer to deter cats from attacking the birds in my back yard.  I have several feeders in my yard, and in the summertime when the bushes and ground cover is heavy, several cats in the neighborhood hide in the brush and very often leap out and nail birds that are ground feeding.  I can't tell you how many times I have gone out there some time during the day to see a pile of feathers on the ground.  Sometimes I am fortunate enough to catch them hiding and I chase them off.  But I can't be back there all the time. Both me and the birds were losing the battle big time for a while. I even resorted once to laying down one of those sprinkler hoses and leaving it on low all the time.  But that was wasteful and expensive...   This sprinkler thingy has been a Godsend to me and the birds.  It's so easy to hook up.  You just put a battery in it, attach a hose to it and stick it in the ground.  Its that simple.  I bought two of them for the bushes on each side of my fence and installed a Y connector in the hose so it can deliver water both ways.  It takes a while to get the sensitivity just right, but then its just sit back and watch it patrol the grounds for you.  Since I have had it installed I have not seen the remains of a single victim.  And the burst of water that is left behind is useful to the birds and harmless to the cats. It's true that you have to have a hose running across your yard for it to work, but that is a minor irritation for what you get out of it as far as service for sure.  When I first installed it I saw the area wet all the time as the cats were taking their chances with it.  Now its less and less being used as they have become wise to it and moved on to other game somewhere else.  It's true that the battery doesn't last as long as one would want, but I really don't mind it.  I just change it at the beginning of the month from late spring through September whether it needs it or not and its up and working without interruption.  In conclusion, this is one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest form of motion detector sprinkler I have found on Amazon. It installs in a jiffy, works perfectly for me, and seems very well made.  I can't attest to its durability yet, but for the price and performance I highly recommend it.  Great product.. : )	1
bought this as a gift and the person loved it	1
All of the other reviews are dead on when they talk about how well it works. Motion detection is fantastic. I has been activated about a dozen times by my cats and the squirrels. My cats no longer head for the fence and stay in their own yard. Can't wait to try it in the front to keep the deer out. One thing to consider. I have soft soil. When the sprinkler is activated it jerks a little bit. Due to my soft soil it was off kilter and aiming the wrong way after going off three times. I lengthened the stake with some re-bar and bailing wire to plant it deeper in the ground.	1
soothing sounds..we love them..	1
Excellent.	1
Yes - they are wonderful!  Mellow, low tones, very nice to hear.  I love to hear them calling me from across the yard.  They are easily heard but won't annoy the neighbors.  I have these and "mercury" - both are quite lovely!	1
I was so happy & surprised to find a nice wind chime that not only was good quality,beautiful to look at,sounds stunning but is inexpensive too. Has been a joy to have on my front porch. Makes beautiful music.	1
Impressive!  Absolutely beautiful chimes.  Very few chimes sound so appealing.  No matter what combination of strikes the wind produces!  Never annoying, even in gusty weather.  Always a pretty melody to give.  This set really is a melodic masterpiece I am happy to have on my porch.  Attractive coloring too.  Worth every penny.  Relaxing, clear, and tonally perfect.  Cannot recommend Chimes of Tuscany ENOUGH!  Going to buy this set again as a gift!  Treat yourself.  Don't miss out on this set.  BUY IT.	1
I have used these for several years and have a half dozen of them. They are ridiculously expensive however so when I saw a Lightning Deal on Amazon I grabbed another one and sent links to friends who also have used these after seeing ours. Our yard is way too big and one side is a riverbank so a deer fence is not practical. I use these in series to make a virtual fence where our roses and some other deer delicacies reside. I know it works because when we forget to turn it on after working in that area the deer return. It may take a few days or a week but eventually they are back. A friend uses them differently. He fenced his yard except a single open space which he guards with the Scarecrow. It is great fun to watch out his window as a small herd works it's way towards the opening in the fence and then scatters in panic as the sprayer goes off. It is clearly not the water but the sudden noise that does the trick as they all take off not just the closest one that triggered it.	1
Real quality and beautiful sound. Gave to my husband for Father's Day. I had been shopping every where for deck dcor when I found this on Amazon.  If you go to the Woodstock website, you can hear what the chimes sound like before purchasing.  This one is FANTASTIC!	1
Reviews indicated it would take quite a breeze to make this chime but I don't find that to be the case.  Slight breeze sets it off.  Stronger breeze & I've had to take it down.  Not quite as resonate as hoped, more tinkly.  Love the tone with just barely a breeze, but quickly becomes annoying in any breeze you can see the leaves blowing.  Wish there was some kind of damper that could be attached rather than having to take it town.	1
I have had this product for a year now, and it has worked great to keep the deer and rabbits out of the garden.  However, it quit working one day.  I called the company with my amazon receipt in hand and they sent me some how to instructions for cleaning the unit.  I followed the instructions but the unit still did not work.  I called them back and they replaced the unit under warranty.  I am very happy with customer service of this company.	1
shared these with my mother because they sound like the theme song from Chariots of Fire movie. beautiful quality, long-lasting construction. they are outside her lakehouse next to the back door where they entertain visitors on the deck or alert her of high winds while she is eating indoors.	1
I bought three chimes thru Amazon -- one for my backyard / one for my front yard / one for when one of those broke.  I've bought many chimes in my lifetime but the Woodstock ones are very durable.  I see no damage to either of my chimes and I keep them outside in the MI weather all year round.  I love the beautiful music (especially on a windy night hearing it from my bedroom window).  They speak to me and this one is special (beautiful to look at, too).  I probably won't have to get out the "3rd" chime I purchased for a long time but I'm eager to listen to its music too.	1
We tried everything to keep our neighbors nine cats from using our yard as a potty - pepper, yard deterrents, dog scents.  This is the only thing that has worked.  In order to have it sensitive enough for the cats in our front yard though, it also goes off every time a person passes on the sidewalk or a car drives by.  Hoping those cats will retrain themselves to go to the bathroom in their own yard as our front lawn is constantly soaked.  It is doing its job it is supposed to do!	1
I have many chimes in my backyard because it love the sound it makes, however, this one just stands out from all of them.  It has a unique soft peaceful chime that just relaxes the soul.  And if that wasn't enough the wine color is beautiful enough.  Definitely recommend it.	1
My dog was digging in our garden, which had to stop. I looked for solutions online and discovered this gem. After we put it in the garden, the digging stopped pretty quickly. It's funny to watch the dog head to the garden to dig only to be surprised by the sprinkler...  Be careful though, if you forget to turn the silly thing off and get within range you'll get a good soaking! My wife laughed so hard when I got sprayed and practically broke my neck trying to get out of the way.	1
This is a great chime for peaceful, calming, delightful sounds as it fills the air with beautiful music. It has become my favorite.  Even those who normally don't care for wind chimes have commented on the lovely tones this one makes.  Has a easy bass reflection not a tinny sound so many chimes produce. Excellent find!! .	1
very good price, rocket fast shipping, well made product,  works excellent, motion detector goes off, jets of water come out at a very rapid rate,  and keeps cats from crapping and digging in my lawn.  Also keeps the racoons, possum  out. Put this unit by your sidewalk and it will stop people from walking  their dogs in your yard and allowing them to crap  in your lawn.  Caution:  You will want to secure your scarecrow(lock it down),  as there are those types of people  that will want to steal it.  Highly recommend this product.	1
Had my Scarecrow for at least 3 years.  It might be 4.  Doesn't matter.  Its still working very well and is one of the best "gadgets" I've ever bought.  My only complaint is that it tends to become a little erratic when the battery gets a little low.  But I generally only use it a few weeks to keep birds off my newly-seeded winter lawn, so, that's not a big issue.  That being said, it has been borrowed and used for a variety of purposes and has withstood a considerable amount of abuse.  Product has exceeded my expectations for longevity.  It has an absolutely electrifying effect on stray cats!!!  Hee hee hee...	1
Saw it, ordered it, great turn around time and a perfect , not obnoxious, chime for the back yard. Classy look.	1
The sound is beautiful and the unit is well designed.  We just love listening to it.  bought two and tjhey are both terrific.	1
I LOVE the color of these wind chimes. They are a deep purple, have a nice sound and look great hanging in my kitchen by the window. In the spring when I can open the windows they will sound great in there! I may put them up outside once the nice weather comes. They look as if they would last a while, good solid quality. I was happy I picked these out for myself while xmas shopping this year :)	1
Purchased for a gift (after previewing the ring tones on the Manufacturer's website). The tones are round and full and linger beautifully.  The wood is stained a kicked-up burgundy and it went well with the black finish of the pipes. It's not "tinny" maybe a bit "tingly" but a very nice tone overall. I would buy again, I would buy this brand and Amazon Prime made the difference for us; got it fast and the Manufacturer's packaging was very nice and well protected.	1
Very simply put, the Chimes of Tuscany are amazing. I have owned Woodstock Chimes for many years and that is a plus as this states they last many years. By far this set has become my favorite set as a slight hint of wind seems to encourage the sweet, tinkling sound without any clanging or harsh tones. They are beautiful in a color resembling cherry wood. The price is also amazing for high quality chimes as I have paid much more for similar sized Woodstock chimes. You won't go wrong with this purchase.	1
I used this item to deter groundhogs and deer from eating my garden. It definitely worked at deterring animals; for a period of time. It didn't make it through an entire season. Once, mid day, the pressure build up ruptured a new hose and flooded my back patio.  A month later the head blew off, and the yard flooded. Also, if you like to sleep with the windows open, it does make quite a bit of noise when triggered.	-1
I bought this chime about four years ago which sounds real nice, good quality. We just had a bad snow storm with 50 mph winds gusts and the center string broke. The wood feather went off into where ever. Customer Service @ Woodstock Percussion sent me a replacement free of charge even after it was out of warranty. Will diffidently buy their products again.	1
I have had a major deer problem which I am now attacking with a small army of these scarecrows.  I am generally getting good results, but its not just set-and-forget: I have a large area so I need to move them around to keep the deer guessing, the mess of hoses needs to be moved each time the grass is cut, and the battery life of the units is not so good.  I think the reason why I have had such poor battery life is the units can be triggered by cars on a nearby street.  Make sure to aim them away from where people or cars routinely go or you will chew through the batteries.  I use a hose timer so they will not spray during the day, and I wish the units had timers in themselves so they could save their power for the night (and, I could skip the hose timer).  One of the bottom spikes broke on one of the units and the company had a replacement part to me within a week - very good customer service.  I notice the new spike has been redesigned, it has a place you can push on with your foot to get it in the ground which will probably reduce the problem with breakage.	1
I bought this item to keep the raccoons off my lawn at night, they are wrecking it. I should have listened when one reviewer said it is worthless because it shoots the stream of water way too high, and the height adjustment is worthless. It might work for giraffes or 7' bigfoots, but is totally worthless for an animal as short as a raccoon. I removed the sprinkler from the top and heated a 2" x 3/4" plastic nipple with couplings on the ends to keep them from de-forming, and bent it on about a 30 degree bend, and installed this on the bottom of the sprinkler to aim it down some. This helps some, but now the spray has an arc to it, so it sprays a little higher at both ends of the pattern. It's better than it was by quite a bit, but is not perfect. Needs to be engineered so the fitting where the water comes out is not aimed so high, or better yet is adjustable. I wouldn't buy one, unless you want to do some home engineering work on it. Update: Like other reviewers are saying, this thing really eats batteries. I'm averaging about 4 days. Pretty expensive to operate. Overall really not worth the money. I have pretty much skunk proofed my fence, which, it seems, was my main problem, so maybe will return this worthless thing.	-1
First morning after I'd set them up as a test (I got two), wandered out into the dawn, forgot all about them and boy was I startled? Yes I was, and wet. More careful in future. A few evenings ago I happened to glance out a window (you know how you do) and there was a fully grown doe wandering through the yard as if she owned it (you know how they do) when she triggered one of them which squirted water at her whereupon she leaped straight up into the air and came down with all legs running, straight into the zone of the other one which gave her its best shot. It was like one of those Warner Bros. cartoons; she disappeared so fast I swear her little hooves were smoking. Poor thing!	1
Our nemesis is a bear that breaks down the blueberry bushes to better eat the berries.  One squirt and he shoots off like a rocket and never comes back.  The chipmunks, however, unless near the sprayer, never trigger it.	1
We had been looking for some method to keep our dogs away from the fence when people, kids, other dogs walked by.  (They also chase motorcycles and big trucks along the fence line).  They go crazy fence fighting and "play fighting" with each other, which is really harmless but it scares people silly and is something we need to stop.  I searched the internet for ideas to stop fence fighting and could not find anything.  The dogs are too quick to be able to intercept them before they get to the fence and we end up yelling at them after the fact, which doesn't teach them proper manners.  However, one night I saw an episode of "My Cat From Hell" where they used one of these to repel a stray cat and I realized it might work!  One thing I wasn't sure about was whether or not the sprayer could be adjusted to spray just straight or if it always swiveled, as we have a small yard and I didn't want it to spray the whole yard -- but it has adjustable guides so you can precisely adjust the angle of the spray -- we have ours just spray a single stream straight ahead, and we aimed it lengthwise along the fence, so if our dogs run toward the fence the sprinkler comes on!  It works flawlessly, and although we've only had it up a couple of days, my dogs are already avoiding the fence!  This is EXACTLY what we were looking for -- kind of a reverse repellant to keep our dogs from bothering passersby!	1
Works as advertised. I love it when the geese walk in front of this sprinkler and get the shock of there life.	1
I bought it to chase the deer eating my garden .....did I forget to mention rabbits? It works! I thought about buying two because of the size of my garden, but I just move it around. Simple but extremely effective. If deer are eating at your garden buffet this is a most have.	1
The Contech Scarecrow was very easy to set up. Just hook up the hose, add batteries, and aim in the right direction. I just adjusted the sensitivity to 4 and works very well for detecting deer. It does work on infrared, detecting changes in temperature in the target area, so be aware that during really hot days it may go off without animals present due to hot air currents. other than that works very well, detects motion efficiently and we now have tomatoes actually growing and maturing on the plant versus being eaten by vermin. Another caveat, at first I would turn off the water during the day but quickly the deer learned that pattern and modified their eating behavior. Who would have figured they were that smart. So now my water is on 24/7. I actually had a deer the other day walk by in broad daylight while I sat in the patio under my deck and the poor thing appeared aggravated and stomped its feet at me and made a funny exhaling sound. I guess I made it very angry. So this is good, nice tomatoes and unhappy deer. A very good outcome with a very modest investment.	1
Like others, we've had a problem with obnoxious pests visiting our yard late at night.  The Contech Scarecrow worked really well the first time, but the vermin rapidly adapted and learned to avoid the covered region (front yard plus bedroom window).  Even moving the Scarecrow around only worked the first couple of times.  I've decided to use rose bushes and transplanted poison ivy as a more permanent deterrent.	1
My house sits on a half acre, and two of my neighbors like to feed the feral cats. Needless to say they eat their food at my neighbors backdoors and use my property as a litterbox. They have ruined my grass,bushes,and sprayed on the sides of my house. I bought two of these Scarecrows and couldn't believe it! They actually work! The cats are all but gone. The trick is to move them to different spots every week or two. They work so well that I am planning on buying two more. These are well worth the money! P.S. I have read where other people comlpained about water entering the battery compartment. So I used some duct tape on the battery compartment door and it keeps the water from getting into the batteries.	1
I was really skeptical but I was desperate to keep my neighbor's cat out of my yard and away from my bird feeders.  I love cats (I have 2 indoor cats) but I did NOT want hers snacking on my birds. I've spent a lot of money on landscaping and bird feeders for my yard to create a bird sanctuary.  I set this up and lo and behold the cat quit coming over. I have never seen it actually get sprayed, but I did see it running across her yard away from my fence wet one day so I figured it did.  The sensitivity control is great.  I have it set where birds in the yard or my juniper trees along the fence don't set it off waving in the wind.  I recommend this to anyone!!!	1
I purchased three of these to keep antelope away from some small trees that have had all the leaves eaten off of them for several years. They are working very well. The one "problem" I have had, is forgetting they are set up and walking in front of them.  :^0  Addendum: The first three have worked so well that I added four more, bringing my total flock to seven. I did have one that began leaking after a year or so. It was promptly replaced by the manufacturer with only a phone call.	1
The ScareCrow is easily configurable for detection sensitivity and the Range and Direction of sprinkler.  I use it to protect a "D" shaped pond 20 x30 feet in area from a Herron. Detector will activate when a plant moves in its field of vision, on a windy day it will activate once or twice an hour.  The battery lasts at least two weeks under such conditions.  Device has too much plastic, but working well.	1
I grow veggies and fruit a narrow but long side yard. Squirrels have been chewing up my persimmons and zucchinis, while the neighbors' cat been using my shredded redwood mulch as litter. The Scarecrow has been up for 4 days now and the critter situation has been abated.  My only complaint is that the stake that came w/ the item is very short, such that after a day's use the recoil forces kind of loosen it. We installed the Contech ScareCrow brackets today, should help hold it better in place. Similar to other reviews, I noticed the unit leaking water, but only when it's connected to the stake. When connected to the hose directly for use w/ the bracket, it's fine.	1
I stumbled across the photos for this product. They were so funny I almost died. Who knew a lawn sprinkler could have a cult following?	1
We ordered this in 2009 when we decided to put in a veggie garden to keep the dogs from running through it, and the cats from pooping in it. It worked exactly the way we had hoped. It has also kept the deer, bunnies, and woodchucks away. The only thing it had no effect on was a giant snapping turtle who took its sweet time crossing in front of the repeated blasts of water. (Fun to watch!) We pulled out the same sprinkler again this spring and set it up to guard the newly planted garden. Except for needing a new battery, it still works as well as it did the first day. We have had no problem with the mechanics, the plastic, or leakage. As long as you put it away in a safe, dry place for the winter, (we live in the northeast) you should have no problem with this unit. Divide the cost by three years, and it has most definitely been worth it!	1
I purchased this from AMAZON as a last ditch effort to keep my neighbor's cats out of my freshly planted flower garden. We live in a rural area and are at the mercy of deer and stray dogs, as well. I previously tried cayenne pepper, which had no effect after the first afternoon shower, and a crazy expensive dog and cat repellent that my dogs liked so well they rolled in it.  Well, I assembled (easy) this SCARECROW the day it arrived.  It only took a minute to adjust it properly and we have been cat, dog and deer free for three days now.  Incidently, my neighbor with the offending cats advise me he does not like my new toy because now his cats are using his garden for a litter box.  I gave him the remaining dog and cat repellent and wished him luck!	1
It is what it says it is.  Really works.  Chases cats off.  Highly recommended!  Very simple to set up.  Easy access to battery.	1
We live in the desert so not many people have grass in their yards, however we do. Because of this we attract colonies of rabbits and they are killing our yard and eating everything I try grow. I recently planted some clover seed to fill in the patches of grass their urine has killed, but the whole task would be useless had I not found the Scarecrow sprinkler. I'm happy to report this has almost completely solved our problem. We have been keeping the sprinkler pointed towards the section we are repairing and the clovers are coming in undisturbed. However, there are blind spots as the sprinler cannot see off to the sides very well. Now the rabbits are hanging around the other half of our yard. Solution- we will definately be getting another one of these for the other half. One annoying thing about the Scarecrow is they didn't include a ring to were you attach the hose to make attaching and unscrewing easier; you have to twist the entire sprinkler around making lining up the threads kind of a pain. Regardless this is has been the best rabbit repellent I could find. I highly recommend the Scarecrow!	1
If you are having problems with dogs or cats in your flower beds, this product is the way to go. I was having problems with the neighbor's dogs and cats, as well as two cats that just decided to live with us. I purchased this item about a month ago and already have moved it to another location as the critters do not care to walk even close to where it was originally placed. As a matter of fact, our dogs had to go by the flower bed where the scarecrow was first placed to get out into the yard from the house. They would stand on the porch and only go past the flower bed when convinced they needed to do so. They went in a dead run and had to be let back into the house from the garage because they did not want to get sprayed on the way back in. Plus, it is good comic relief to see them meander into the spray zone for the first time or two!	1
I think this works. We'll see next year when the flowers come back. Anyways, in order to get this to work right, it is going to take a little bit more effort then just screwing this in to the hose bib.  You need: This scarecrow sprinkler Teflon tape Orbit hose timer- 7 day programmable 7 foot hose extender.  Since the sprinkler male connects are plastic, water drips out a little, unless you use the teflon tape. I got the wrong orbit timer, which only turned the water on for 3 hours at a time.  The 7 day programmable allowed me to keep the water on for 12 hours a day. so this was perfect since I need the flowers protected from 10pm to 7 am everyday.  The hose extender was needed because I didn't want 25 feet of hose in the front yard, and it was cheap.  The neighbors thought the setup was smart.	1
Yes this thing works very well. You may will continue to scare yourself for weeks until you remember that you left it on. Its very funny watching cats too. The sensor lets you get in range and then gives it to you every time - Water that is. And its easy to set and forget. This product works better than expected and still runs off the same battery(s)? that we started with. It was months ago so I can't remember what type. 5 Stars..	1
We live in an area with very heavy deer pressure, and I am able to defend my garden with the Scarecrow and Deer Guard spray.  The Scarecrow gunks up with our hard  water, and tends to leak at the hose junction, but is worth the hassles and expense.  I usually have two or three set up, and without them plants worth hundreds of dollars would be eaten like a deer buffet. Deer are creatures of habit, and tend to wander the same pathways, so it is easy to figure out where to place them. Too bad more garden centers don't carry the Scarecrow, it truly keeps our herd of 7 deer at bay.	1
My scarecrow is great fun.  I have it in line with my back window so I can see the results!  It's hilarious to watch the squirrels try to avoid getting wet.  If you are really mean, you can bait it with peanuts or pistachios that didn't open.  You need to secure the hose fittings so you don't waste water, and it's a bit tricky to aim, but this can be overcome by trial and error. DON'T FORGET TO TURN OFF YOUR HOSE WHEN ADJUSTING FITTINGS,OR YOU'LL BE THE ONE GETTING WET. I can't wait for warmer weather to hook mine up for the season. Those bushy-tailed lawn wreckers had better beware !  If you can afford it, two that would aim a 'V' shaped pattern on your lawn would be ideal.  For the money, you can't buy more fun than a scarecrow or two.	1
I purchased it on amazon. com, and it may be ok for some, but in my opinion its not worth the money it codts.i spent hours trying to stop it from leaking andnever did stop it. stop onw thing from leaking then its leaking some where else, fix that, then the first thing is leaking again, maybe I just got a lemon	-1
We bought two of these scarecrows several years ago and have used them continually ever since. Deer are a major problem in this area. Forget deer resistant plants, they will eat almost anything when they are hungry. What they don't eat, they destroy, pulling it up and spitting it out! We tried several chemicals including wild animal urine, without success. On the recommendation of a local landscaper we purchased the scarecrows and they really worked! They protected even the most tender (delicious) plants.  After the warranty expired, a big buck, escaping the spray, stepped on a scarecrow and broke the spray head. I called the factory, (phone number and e-mail on the included brochure) and they promptly sent a reasonably priced replacement.  Recently, after six years of use, one unit was still working normally, but the other started spraying with a very small flow. I was prepared to buy a new one as we had several new tender plants that needed protection and I still needed both. However, I first tried again calling the phone number on the brochure, to my surprise it still worked! I talked with a very polite gentleman who suggested I try disassembling the unit and thoroughly cleaning the parts with a vinegar solution, he would e-mail the instructions. He did, and I cleaned it following the very clear (with pictures) instructions. It wasn't that hard and the scarecrow worked like new! The scarecrows were initially expensive, but they are still doing the job and have been well worth the cost.	1
Deer had just been decimating my flower bed.  I tried spraying them with a product called Deer Stopper, which didn't work and the company will not honor their own money back guarantee.  In fact, I think the deer actually liked it.  Anyway, the first night after installing the Contech Scarecrow, at about 3am, I heard the sprinkler go off, and a great commotion outside.  Upon examining my flower bed the next morning, there were rocks & debris scattered about when the deer headed out at high speed!  Since then, I've purchased another Scarecrow to put in my garden and they've both worked perfectly.  This product is well worth the money.	1
I wish there were ****** six star ratings!  This product deserves at least that many stars!  We received the Contech CRO101 Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler yesterday and installed it this afternoon. I just heard it activate (10 pm) twice and in the dark I saw two pair of amber colored raccoon eyes in the near forest. YES, IT WORKS!!!! What a blessing!  NOTE:  Don't waste your money on the Havahart motion activated sprinkler; it doesn't work! It only activated if there was movement within 4 feet of the sensor. Buy the Contech Electronics CRO101 Scarecrow Motion-Activated Sprinkler through Amazon.

Works better than I expected.  Keeps the damn cats off my lawn from doing their business.  I would recommend this product.  Tried a few others and this is th eonly one that worked for me.	1
had high hopes for this as a cat deterrent..but after 2 days of hearing and seeing it go on/off i was dissapointed. I would sit there watching it go ON but no animals or anything around my yard? Then i would wave a broom in front of it...and NOTHING....usually.  Not sure why it had a mind of its own, i was very hopeful but dissapointed.  I would have given it a 1-star, but Amazon had it for almost 1/2 the cost of Homedepot and other web sites and the return policy seemed very user friendly so i bummped it up to 2-star for that reason alone. good luck with yours if you buy one. steve / N.California	-1
This looks like a well built sprinkler.  It seems to work for a lot of people, but it did not work for me.  The motion sensing was unreliable even at its most sensitive level.  The squirrels were undeterred and they continue to plague my garden.	-1
I have had nothing but problems with cats and dogs pooping in my yard and flower garden.  Tried all kinds of mulch, tree bark, etc.  I bought this, it arrived in record time.  I put it together and made a few changes on the decals, like I made fangs instead of eyebrows, had fun doing it and even more fun as I heard it work over and over for the first few days.  It hasn't gone off in in the last 4 days, I checked by walking in it's range and got soaked.  Good thing it's summer.  This works !! It is worth every penny.	1
I tried everything for my vegetable garden including fencing, electric fencing, solar vibration but this is the only product that actually worked.  I have deer, chipmunk, turkey, and the most annoying, ground hogs.  This works for all of them.  Just set the sensitivity to the right setting.  Don't jack up the setting too high, otherwise, it'll go off a lot.  Not sure why other reviews say the battery runs out fast which I was worried about but I've had it going for about a month with the product going off several times a day without any issues with the battery.  Perhaps they jacked up the sensitivity to the top.  The only downside is based on the size or layout, you may need to get several of these to keep out the animals.  I have a garden about 50 x 20 with 2 tiers and tall plants so I needed at least 4 to get a good coverage.  Amazon has the best price so get what you need for your garden and keep those pesky animals away!	1
Purchased on Amazon, it was half the price found at my local nursery. Only problem is that the battery does not last very long. Two weeks.	1
WOW! After all these years of trying to keep the deer out who knew this thing was the answer. It works 100% of the time. Just remember to turn it on. It's been on now for over a month and I have not had to change the batteries yet. My garden is left alone and we are in the deep woods surrounded by deer and animals. It's AMAZING! I can grow anything I want now  with no fence. The Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler works in the blackest of nights with no problem. AMAZING GENIUS DEVICE that actually works! Other then it spraying animals, it also makes a loud rattle snake noise while it moves. Keeps them running and they do not come back. It scares the you know what out of them and they remember to stay away. I don't see roaming deer anymore in any part of my yard that is not protected. Once the deer establish it's a scary place they don't come back. GENIUS!  suggested improvements would be:  * A remote control with an on and off button. * A longer stake or a more stable stake - I have to use rocks around it to keep it in place. it's very strong when shooting the water out and jerks around. right now it's in solid dirt with no grass. * Adding little flying arms and legs under the motion detector at the neck for when it's breezy would also help keep the birds away.	1

However, ordering the Contech Electronics CRO101 Scarecrow Motion-Activated Sprinkler was not one of them. I LOVE IT. In fact it works so well that I ordered a second and connected them (you can connect several units and each will operate independently when you do).  The units are easy to set up and work as advertised. Just place a 9-volt battery (not included) and then adjust what I call the "sweep" area (the area you want the sprayer to cover).  I shot this short video review to show you the units in action. Hope this helps! And feel free to ask me any questions.	1
Very Cool lil product, not yellow as shown, but all black and easier to hide. Really scaress the Cats away! Has hose outlet on front so you can hook up another hose to do daily watering.	1
The unit works great when large subjects move by, even cars at 100 feet. But when a Jack Rabbit RUNS in front...NOTHING! It has some value however in that it's mere presents, and the fact that it goes off with any movement of a large subject probably is seen and heard by rabbits. I watched as a cotton tail hopped up to the scare crow and just stared at it for a couple of minutes.	-1
I bought this to keep the raccoons out of my pond and away from my fish.  I hooked it up to a timed sprinkler system so it comes on at 9 pm and off at 5 am.  It works WONDERFUL.  I heard that rascal come over the fence about 4am and the sprinkler took him right back over the fence.  It was easy to put together and not hard to set up the parameters for the automatic eye.  I would buy this item again and again and have told anyone who will listen all about it.	1
Startled by all the positive reviews.  Influenced by the encouraging reviews, purchased this product on two occasions (the second time after our memory had faded about the poor experience the first time around).  Besides the cheaply-made sensor housing, the mechanism is erratic and doesn't closely reproduce its stated intent.  In an effort to create the ideal `conditions' for the ScareCrow, we even purchased a pressure reducer as well as a new set of 9V batteries (as suggested in the manual ).  To no avail.  At best, this item may have amused our local wildlife; certainly didn't trouble them.  The ScareCrow (at least to us) was a waste of money, highly unreliable, and not effective in its intended purpose.	-1
I confess that I like gadgets. This gadget is one of the best things I've ever bought!  I'm having a very hard time NOT buying a night spy cam to see if any animals are scared off by this. I've seen the videos online, and they're hilarious. I'd love to have my own video of a fat groundhog going in for the kill, only to be startled by the scarecrow and running away.  It works just like it does in the promo videos, although I've only been able to test it with myself and a stick. Plan on getting wet the day you install it. The sensitivity dial works quite well, and I keep it at about medium-high. All I can say is that the garden is doing well, and knock on wood, no groundhog has eaten the entire garden in one night. And I know there's at least one groundhog, because I saw him in the back yard one day eating things from the lawn.  My only complaint is that I found it hard to figure out how to change the arc size of the spray. I didn't think the instruction booklet did a great job of showing how to do that. Perhaps a video online would be more helpful. (I did eventually get it worked out, but for the first day, the scarecrow was going in circles and I thought it was defective.)  Whoever invented this gadget gets my thanks. It has provided hours of entertainment! And I'm giving it credit for a garden that so far, is thriving.	1
I deleted an earlier review reflecting problems I was having after just two months of use.  Battery died after two months.  Replaced with fesh alkaline battery and that battery died after just 2-3 days.  I called Customer Service this morning and they are shipping me a replacement unit and told me to keep the original for parts or whatever.  I asked if they could ship me decals for the replacement unit and they said, "sure."  Great Customer Service!!!	1
This is the only thing that really keeps the deer away. Other chemical repellents just don't seem to work all the time. Only negative is having to keep the water pressure on hoses.	1
The Scarecrow is great.  We kept having creators dig around our backyard at night. The Motion-activated Sprinkler works GREAT to run them off.  No chemicals or repellents, just water. Great product.	1
I have 3 wonderful cats and they are allowed to roam in the fenced in backyard. This spring I noticed some Eastern Bluebirds beginning to build a nest in one of my birdhouses......and 3 cats were right under it, watching every move. That's when I started hunting for a repellant that wouldn't hurt anything AND would work. I purchased a Scarecrow and it is the cat's meow! I stationed it so that it pointed at the area under the birdhouse! That was so much fun! It only took one squirt for my cats to avoid that area like the plague. Then I noticed brown spots on the front lawn that I suspected were from early morning visits from a neighbors dog. I moved the Scarecrow out there...and shazzam, the brown spots healed! I'm telling you..this thing is worth it for entertainment purposes alone! AND YES, it's gotten me a bunch too...I get busy and forget it's there.... and I about fall down laughing every time!! My cats learned much faster than I did!	1
I bought this product in an effort to reduce damage the deer had inflicted on my garden.  It really worked!  Since I began using it about a month ago I have had zero losses to deer or any other animal for that matter.  I bought one for my father and he has had great success as well.	1
Made of cheap plastic.  I can see this thing breaking very easily.  It works on large animals and me for the most part.  Kind of a pain in having to dodge this thing to get to the controls every time I want to go into the yard.  Have to remember to turn it on every night or risk blowing up the garden hose if left on in the hot sun every day. Watched rabbit walk right by the thing without it going off.  Also went off a lot with nothing around.  Decided to try liquid fence instead.  My Mom swears by the stuff.	-1
The first year that I had my strawberry patch they were eaten by the neighborhood raccoons before they even completely ripened. I also have a veggie garden adjacent to the strawberries and it was being used as a kitty toilet and nothing worked to deter these critters until I found the contech! Since then I've been able to harvest every strawberry and I no longer have to "scoop" my veggie garden every week. Even when I forget to turn it back on, the cats see the scary bird and avoid the area. I placed it so I could turn it off from behind whenever I needed to go by and set it so it sprays away from the path of the meter-reader. It really doesn't have to hit the intruders--they are so startled by it just turning on that I can really narrow the spray pattern. I plan to purchase another to protect my pond fish from predators and maybe a third to help protect trees and shrubs outside of the deer fence.  Cons: Not particularly well-built. I treat it gingerly because it is all plastic. I haven't had any problems with leakage so far, but I've only had it 1 year. Another drawback is that it can't be used in freezing temperatures, but there's not much that can be done about that. Of course it's not fun when I forget to turn it off and get doused. Careful placement is a must.	1
After losing numerous large and expensive Koi out of our pond due to a heron and trying other products that did nothing, we decided to go with this. So glad we did because it really works! I can hear the heron land on our roof and see it land in front of the pond and within seconds flies off due to the spray from the scarecrow. We haven't lost a Koi since setting this device up. I am now going to purchase an additional scarecrow for my front yard to keep the neighbors mangey a$$ annoying cats out of my yard! They are using my garden as a catbox not to mention stalking birds at my bird feeder and bird baths. I despise these cats so this will be fun watching them get sprayed while entering my yard. Only downfall is my dogs and myself have gotten sprayed by walking in front of the scarecrow. But this is my fault and isn't a big deal considering how well this thing works! Try it, you won't be dissapointed!	1
I totally LOVE this thing!  Not only does it keep squirrels from raiding the bird feeders and suet feeders, it keeps the cat from catching birds anywhere near the birdfeeders!	1
After reading the reviews of other items used to get cats from making a litter box out of yard gardens, I went straight to this item which had great reviews. The others that used everything from coyote urine to cayenne pepper. This item had a long, wide, and selectable spray area and there were not complaints about the sensitivity of the detector. I got immediate and effective results. The offending cat left some disturbed mulch where he sprang out if there so fast! In fact, my neighbor decided to give this cat, that was not litter box trained, to relatives in the country, and to keep his other cat which he could keep indoors. He was even very nice about it, finally, and was intrigued by the motion detector sprinkle. The only question I have about this item is that I'm not sure if the washer that is meant to make the seal to my hose could be improved or not. It may have been my hose end, but I didn't get a perfect seal and had water seepage at the hose connection that would have been a problem if I had to use this long term. IF it was because of the washer, that would be cheap enough to replace, and since it was so effective and my neighbor responded extremely favorably, I don't need to use it anymore. 5 Stars!	1
We live on a lake with ducks. They like to hang out under the shade of my boat house on the dock. You can imagine the mess from a flock of ducks. We bought this to keep the dock clean when we go boating. I hooked this up and about five minutes later the first ducks landed. This thing turned on they all flew away. It worked perfectly. After a couple of days they were conditioned to stay away from the dock. Now I turn it on maybe once a week for a couple of minutes when ever a new duck shows up. I can't imagine anything working better.	1
We have a horrible feral cat problem in our neighborhood, and our sandy playground area in our background is a haven for cats who choose to relieve themselves.  The Scarecrow has been our perfect response.  With hose hooked into this device and a 9V battery, cats are extremely wary about approaching our background, much less actually be brave enough to venture into it.  The fact that it doesn't require an outlet and that a 9V battery is sufficient to run it is spectacular.  The senstitivity of the motion sensor (which works better at tracking movements from left-to-right rather than to/from) can be adjusted to whatever size target you want it to spot.  Higher sensitivities will track cats and smaller critters, lower sensitivities will only trigger if humans walk through the field of view.  The water projects a pretty good distance, approximately 30 feet although we're not sure if higher ranges could be accommodated or not.  Highly recommend!	1
The first one of these we tried,to scare away amimals digging up a lawn,was impossible to adjust. If you set it sensitive enough to trigger when a small animal approached,it would also trigger every time a bird flew by,and at random times throughout the day and night.(maybe defective,we are ordering another)  Also you have to have a hose connecting to this and it will be sitting in the sun with full pressure 24/7. I used the best hose I could find and it eventually exploded and ran for 8 hours. Luckily no serious damage,just thousands of gallons wasted.  Great idea,but I would say "back to the drawing board".	-1
OK, this thing really does work well. I've had mine for over 6 years. But the spike to stick it in the ground is a pain. Unit will fall over or even break depending on the hardness of the soil. So get a heavy duty small farm type feed bucket (plastic) and fill it 3/4 full of sawdust and about 1 to 2 inches of concrete on top of the sawdust. You don't need to fill the bucket all the way up. Be sure to keep the hose connection above the level of the bucket or you won't be able to connect up to it. Stick the spike in the concrete and let it dry for 2 days. when you place it in the bucket move it off center so that when you pick up the bucket by the handle it doesn't hit the spike so you can pick it up and move it any where you want with ease. I also use quick connects you can get most any where and its easier when you move it around.	1
This works great! I plan to buy another to get full coverage of my garden. It comes with the "scarecrow" decals not applied so if you do not want them, it is a plain black box. We opted to attach the decals and think it looks great! It senses every animal that has tried to enter the garden including those pesky wild turkeys. I highly recommend this.	1
This thing really works...........Thank you Amazon, for introducing the Scarecrow.  Have told all my friends "what and where".Surprisingly few have heard ofit. Have had it in place for several weeks.  The deer pay attention and, so far, stay out of range of the spray.  It's also entertaining when the wife forgets.  We love it.	1
The Contech motion activated sprinkler is the greatest. The deer have not touched my squarefoot garden since we started using it. You can see tracks near the garden and see how the tracks widen as the deer is startled and runs away. The shipping was very fast, thank goodness.	1
This device works - provided it is set to cover any access area in which an egret, heron, stock, etc. might land to feast on your Koi. Personally, I'd like to use a gun - Instead, I'm using this scarecrow with lots of thin nylon fishing line strung over the pond at a height of 10-12 foot. We also have excellent varmint killers (Cairn and Westie Terriers) - fortunate for the bird(s), they are kenneled while we are at work.	1
Have tried no less than 10 "guaranteed to work" remedies for keeping deer from eating my shrubs next to my house no doubt! Some worked better than others, but all of them had 1 thing in common. Reapplication after rain etc. This is as simple as hooking up to a garden hose and turning it on. Have seen no visible evidence of deer eating on (new or existing) growth since it has been in use. Approx 3 weeks!! *****ADDED BONUS****** My 5 year old grandaugher loves it too! She thinks it is a game of who she can fool into getting squirted.	1
Have used this product for years and never had an issue. Saved alot of plants and shrubs from deer and rabbits (except when the battery runs out). Easy to assemble, use and adjust. Waters the lawn or plants while it scares away invaders.	1
As soon as my day lilies started coming up the deer started nibbling them. I got the Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler and the snacking stopped right away. The plants are a good foot tall now with no further damage. I found that it was simple to set up, fine tuning the sensitivity was no problem, and no one gets hurt. It even covers my bird feeder near the flowers and keeps the squirrels and ravens off the suet cakes. Little birds do not set it off. I will need to re-position it as the plants grow to prevent wind motion from setting it off, no problem. I did purchase a short section of hose to use with it and a two way on/off connector to use at the spigot, to make it easy to turn off and use another hose when working in the garden. A great help for gardening with hungry nature.	1
It really works! I watched as the deer walked into the area and were quickly scared off. You need to fiddle with the sensor are bit to get just the right setting. If there are plants in the sensor range they will cause it to go off when the wind blows, so keep that in mind when placing it. This winter when they were not installed (freezing temps) I watched as the deer would walk the perimeter of the yard and avoid the areas where the sprinklers were placed earlier in the year. One deer actually nibbled an oak tree and kept looking in the area where a sprinkler was placed nearby. The deer evidently remembered it and avoided getting too close. So yes, they work!	1
A waste of my money.  It will go off if a car or person passes by, but won't go off if cats or squirrels come near it and that was what I thought it would do.	-1
We bought a home that stood vacant for half a year. In that time, every cat in the neighborhood became accustomed to using the grounds as a nicely landscaped cat box. I bought this item, and voila! No more cats defecating on the lawn, squirrels uprooting carefully planted bulbs, or raccoons drinking from and splashing in the pool. Even if the water misses them, the clicking sound provides a sufficiently deterrent "freak out" factor. The 'crow provides no small measure of entertainment for a night owl like me who sits quietly outside at night reading or browsing Amazon on the laptop. Easy to assemble, loaded with options for angling and focusing its powerful spray, the Scarecrow delivered. It was worth every penny. I'd advise checking it every few days to ensure that the couplings are completely tight. I flooded a flower bed one day after I repositioned the 'crow. I'd loosened the hose at the bottom. Retightening was easy. As for the warnings about getting sprayed inadvertently (because, say, you go to fetch the mail and forget the 'crow is on), everyone in this family has felt the fury of the 'crow at one time or another, but it just makes you laugh. I like watching it work, but my enthusiasm derives less from seeing an animal in panic, and more from the satisfaction I feel about using a device that doesn't harm an animal. No poison, buckshot, or ravenous watchdogs--all of which seemed reasonable when I was picking up twelve pounds of poo a day. That's why I'm getting two for my parents for Xmas! Peace, Michelle Lamb Discher It's now mid-May 2012. We have neighbors who are feeding (see breeding) feral cats (latest count, over a dozen). In 2009, after it worked so well, I'd deposited the crow in an open bin, and forgot it. Waking up to cat poo everywhere made me remember it, so I dug it out of the bin. Encrusted with a year and a half of rain, winter, dust, and spider webs, it didn't inspire my confidence. But I hooked it up. I needed to deter cats defecating in a small garden near the pool--no dirt for the stake, so I strapped it tightly to a deck upright with velcro strapping. And once again, Voila! This product is not only effective, it's sturdy and long-lasting.	1
I bought this product to keep the squirrels from eating the vegetables and digging in the pots on my deck. Without it, they would ruin the plants in no time.  The Scarecrow  works flawlessly at this task but it has a tendency to go off as the wind is blowing when it sees the movement of the trees. If Contech could improve the circuitry to solve that issue, I could give it 5 stars. Resetting the range of the motion sensor so it doesn't trip in the wind allows the squirrel to sneak onto the deck.  There is a now a mounting bracket sold separately (#CROBRACKET) that helps you mount it onto a post. This item should come with the kit.  Although it wouldn't prevent me from giving the product 5 stars, it would be nice if there was a remote that could disable the sprinkler so I don't get soaked by it. Even using something like the Nelson 56620 would still send out a stream of water until the residual pressure subsided.	1
The Scarecrow has solved our problem with deer in the yard.  We now have 4 of them around the yard and have already obtained two more for guarding a vegetable garden next year.	1
Bought this to keep my dogs from peeing on my lawn. Works great for that. You just have to remember that it's on when you walk in front of it or it will remind you the hard way! Tried it in the vegetable garden to keep the birds and squirrels out, but if you crank up the sensitivity enough, it just goes off all the time. Better suited for dogs and cats. My dog ran into it while chasing the ball and broke the stake off. I called Contech and they sent out a new stake ASAP. Good product, best price anywhere.	1
I bought the scarecrow with the sole intent of keeping my neighbors cat out of my vegetable garden.  Once installed the cat learned to not go near the garden and now it doesn't even enter my yard.  The device worked as advertised.  I think the device could be designed a little more rugged for the price but this seems to be the nature of the modern manufacturing thinking.	1
I knew I had to find a solution after deer repeatedly ate my young broccoli and tomato plants. So-called deer repellent spray didn't work. The Contech motion-activated sprinkler seemed like a good option, and Amazon had a good price for it (way cheaper than Home Depot's).  It just works. And - bonus - it waters your plants. The trick is to set it up right. The sensitivity should be adjusted as the seasons progress. The plants grow, and the device could be activated more often as the wind plays with the plants growing in its radius of detection. The battery should be changed when the device shows signs of fatigue - every 3 to 6 months. The first one I bought went through a freezing winter and a scorching summer and still works perfectly. In fact, I'm so happy with it that I bought another one for the heirloom garden I'm setting up on the other side of the house.	1
I was having a problem with a groundhog that was loving some of my cabbage plants to death (literally). He ate three to complete stumps in two days and was working on his next one when I got this in the mail.  I anxiously set it up and learned much about it in the process. I see most of the people here praising it for getting rid of deer, and it may work well for that because they are large targets. It also does disturb smaller varmints but not in the way I expected.  Thie product is very difficult to review because while it works somewhat,  a 60 dollar product is not necessary for smaller, less intelligent and less numerous pests.  It is probably great for an area infested with pests though, hundreds of deer or tons of groundhogs, but something much simpler could be used in your average garden setting.  The idea of the product is cute and simple enough. It is a motion sensor attached to a sprinkler. If the Scarecrow sees anything that moves, it fires the sprinkler off for about five seconds. It then waits 8 seconds and repeats.  The problem is that with smaller varmints, they can hide behind the plants, and when the Scarecrow is aimed low, every plant movement (breeze blowing a cucumber leaf) sets it off unless you turn the sensitivity down so far that it won't go even off with you dancing in front of it.  When set to scare away smaller pests, this device falses constantly on plant movement and only sees the varmints if they are totally exposed in front of it, which rarely happens in my garden jungle. The motion sensor concept doesn't work well because everything moves in the garden including the plants. It has a false detector that suppoesdly automatically shuts down the sensitivity if it is falsing too much. It doesn't work well. We have watched the Scarecrow go off every 10 seconds for an hour non-stop with nothing in front of it but plants moving in a very light breeze.  The good thing, and the dichotomy for me, is it appeared to get rid of the pest. We have not seen the groundhog since and my few cabbages left are doing OK. So for that, I wanted to give it a much better rating than I otherwise would. The sprinkler does appear to scare away most animals, but it cost me $60 to save $10 worth of cabbage.  Cats, dogs, groundhogs, squirrels, rabbits, etc. appear to be driven away by it. And the battery has lasted several weeks. I just can't give it anything but one star because it doesn't work the way it claims and is very expensive for the average Joe. The device works more like a random sprinkler shooting water at random time intervals depending on the breeze.  A better product, and one that is actually affordable, would be one you set up that randomly fires a sprinkler every few minutes.  It would be much cheaper and just as effective.  You may be able to recreate it with a timing device that runs on a battery and a $7.00 sprinkler, or just a generic timed sprinkler you use when you notice a pest is bugging your plants. But if you have tons of deer, then this may be your only viable solution short of a major fence or wall.  There is another reason the product is very annoying. You have to have it hooked up to the hose all the time. I have to have a hose reeled out across my lawn at all times to reach the garden from the water faucet on my house. It is in the way much of the time, so has to be moved about all the time for family gatherings, lawn mowing, kids want to play in yard etc. But I did discover an alternate use!! Kids love running in front of the Scarecrow. :-) OK, now would you pay $60 to entertain your kids?  OK, so sell it as that.  Much more useful for that purpose.  If marketed as a garden tool, the motion sensor should possibly be a heat sensor or something that can discern better between mammalian presence and a leaf in the wind. The sprinkler is little more than a cheap lawn sprinkler attachment. I am very torn in my rating because here is a device that basically did what I wanted it to do, scared away a varmint eating my plants. It has a major cool factor and is a fun conversation piece loved by the kids. But it falses constantly and is difficult to deal with unless you want to run an underground hose to it and it is expensive.  I am giving it one star because it works, kind of, but it is not what it advertises itself to be.  A motion sensor cannot work in a dense garden for small animals.  BUT YOUR KIDS WILL LOVE IT!  This would get 5 stars as a kids' toy!!  So maybe as a combinational use product it gets more stars?	-1
I was always having problems with my ex's not understanding the common keep away saying like "I don't want to see you again!", or " your sister was much better in bed so please respect my choice and stay away from my house...k thnx!" or even this saying " I have a court order on your a$$ so back the f off!".  Yeah my life was a wreck before this product really. I would wake up in the mourning with paint dumped all over my car, used tampons in my mailbox, one ex even went as far as leaving my newspaper in the middle of the street to bait me out so she could finish me off with her car. From the moment I installed two of these in my front yard I felt a sense of peace come over me, what can I say the auto sprinkler really brings security in the most hummane way possible! I installed them both behind two small bushs on each side of my front lawn at snatch level. I knew this would be the ideal height cause knowing my ex's as I do I know they won't get on all fours but would easily be willing to get on there knees, so I had to make sure the sprinkler head shot above the knees and below the waste.  Now what your thinking, this must be a joke but seriously the first night alone I heard "EEK YOU MOTHER FU****!, I'M GOING TO GET YOU!" and clicking sound of heels running away from the front yard. I have had these installed for two weeks so far with no return of any in wanted strays again!! Thank you so much for designing such a creative product! I am wondering if there will be a self aiming unit in the future?	1
It's a motion activated sprinkler and it does everything as promised.  We got one to help keep rabbits from eating our roses and it has worked perfectly. Not a single nibble this year.  The squirrels also found out about it and to their surprise it kept on spraying them even when they puffed out their chests in retort.  The motion sensor can be set to be very sensitive and so if you have it in front of plants that get blown around a lot by wind, it will be falsely set off.  My only problem is that I (somehow) keep forgetting about it, only to get sprayed coming into the yard.  The stake is plastic but is quite solid. I imagine that it broke for people who tried redirecting the sprinkler with the stake in the ground. The instructions tell you not to do that and if you do, the stake will break...I guess they found out the hard way.  I highly recommend this product without reservation.	1
We repeatedly lost all of our pond Koi to Heron prior to finding this wonderful contraption.  Since then, not one fish in five years has disappeared.  Yes, I have to net the pond in April and early May when it is still too cold to hook up the scarecrow.  That's okay.  But, this scarecrow is on guard from mid-May through mid-October, and it really does the job.  Plus, my pond is adjacent to a wildflower patch that the deer love.  This keeps the deer out of my wildflowers, too.  So, it does double duty.  Every year for five years, I have put in a new battery, hooked it to the hose, and it does the job.  What a wonderful, well built product.	1
The moment I hear the sound of water sprinkler, a smile lights up my face. My neighbor's cat and dog have been claiming territorial rights in my yard for the past 7 years. I wrote to the association, they can't do a thing. I bought repellant sprays, dusts, anti-bacterial sprays, even salt or pepper, nothing worked.  There's just like a virtual bathroom sign inviting the dogs and cats to do their thing.  At last, my sister bought one of these to scare the birds and animals off their swimming pool and lawn, she told me about it, I immediately ordered it on Amazon. Sure enough, after it is installed, during the night, it was "activated" for about 3 times (what I heard, maybe more after I have fallen asleep.) And nothing new was found in my yard in the morning.  It is exciting to have a thing that actually works. Revenge is SWEET!!!  Buy it if you have pest problem. only one improvement, the peg going into the ground should be metal.  I fear it will break easy so I had to hammer out a hole with a large nail first before I really pushed it in.  They should include one of those camping steel pegs for this. Side note, Amazon is like $20 cheaper than the manufacturer's website. Thank you God for infrared.	1
The deer used our flower gardens like a salad bar!  I grew all those pretty zinnias, strawflowers, petunias from seed too (they left the dahlias alone).  I love the deer, we feed them for goodness sakes.  And I understand that eating my plants, well that's what they do.  So, this gadget is heaven-sent; it saves my pretty flowers, keeps the deer out of mischief and my mind at ease.  Assembly was very easy.  It's made of pretty rugged plastic.  Place it out of the way of lawn mowers - it's not indestructible.  Setup and adjustment was a breeze.  It makes a pretty loud "clicking noise" when it senses movement.  That makes it easy to adjust without having the water on.  Here's a tip - if the ground is hard where you want to put it to soften the soil.  Bottom line - it works!  Birds are still able to land in the flower garden without incident.  I'm guessing a cat could meander through as well.  The neighbors golden retriever? I don't know, maybe if he was sort of close.  A man sized or deer sized "target" can't get any closer than 30'-35 feet without turning on the spray.  It sprays for a few seconds and then shuts off.  It has a timer to prevent it from activating again for eight seconds.  All in all I think this product is a winner.  Oh, one more thing, make sure you use a good hose.  You'll be leaving this setup unattended for hours, maybe days at a time.  You sure wouldn't want the hose to burst just as you left to visit Aunt Nellie's for the weekend!	1
The system seems to work just fine. One note: The sprinkler head that came with the unit was totally inferior. There wasn't even diffusion screw included. I had to go to Home Depot and get a "Rain Bird" head. I would recommend that replace the current head with "Rain Bird" heads. JC  UPDATE: I've had the Scarecrow for seven weeks now, and it has done its job. It has kept the cats off my new sod lawn. Before they would use it as their cat box and destroy sections. Not anymore. Muhahahaha! In fact they stay completely off my property. JC	1
It's nice to buy something that works and works as advertised.  I am very pleased.	1
This product does what it claims to, to a first approximation, but the motion sensor is very stupid.  Towards the aggressive end of its sensitivity adjustment it goes off repeatedly into wind or when the pattern of shadows changes fast (perhaps the sun comes out from behind a cloud), but on the same setting it will let deer mosey to within one meter, straight ahead, before it will turn on.  If the area you have to protect is tiny (a few square meters) then it's great.  Deer jump a mile high when they're standing so close.  But for larger areas it is nigh-useless.	-1
We had Raccoons and Herons and Cats all hanging out around our pond.  Not for sure this is what is doing the trick however we've had it in place for a month now and the planters in the pond that kept getting knocked over haven't.  Only problem I've found is that when I come home from work I always like to waltz by the pond and look for fish.  I keep forgetting about this thing and it has nailed me every time!  :~)	1
After deer destroyed my wife's garden over the space of three short nights, we invest in a scarecrow. It was easy to assemble and install and worked perfectly. As long as it is on, it keeps the filthy beasts out of our garden. One caveat: our deer seem to test it regularly and have returned to the garden when I've forgotten to leave the hose on. If you have a hose in your garden and a deer problem, I would not hesitate to buy this product. It works!	1
I wish we would have had this product before the deer ate most of this year's daylilies and hostas.  Looking forward to a garden without deer next season.  Product scares away the deer and neighborhood  kids that use our property as a shortcut home.  Would recommend highly - even though its expensive - I think its worth it!	1
After dear ravaged my vegetable garden (didn't know they like jalopeno peppers) I put up 7' fencing, yeah, like that stopped them!  They just mowed it down and continued to enjoy my banner year of peppers.  I was desprite and bought this locally - this price is far better, but I couldn't wait another night, it was that bad.  The first morning after I used it there was signs of water all over the place and my fencing was intact and they haven't been back.  No chemicals and simple to use.  As for the "fun" part - I didn't realize that my neighbors son who parks his car on the other side of my fence was in sensing range and he got a surprise one morning when he went to get in his car!  He laughed and just said it was "refreshing"!  Wish I had been there to see it - LOL!!!!	1
Scarecrow works as promised. Nice to have a no-chemical response to foraging deer. (Don't forget to turn it off before doing yard work....)	1
Worked as advertised.  Only took our dogs a couple of trips through the sprinkler to understand which part of the yard to avoid.  Don't know how long the battery will last but that's not a big problem.  Now if I can just get the scarecrow to recognize me and NOT trigger when I accidentally walk in front of it.  :-)	1
This product WORKS.  It harmlessly, but very effectively chases deer, dogs, cats, squirrels...you name it. The noise and the water spray really do the trick. Plus, it helps water the garden!	1
I'm happy I do not have to install that fence around my vegetables garden anymore. I have it for a month now and it works well.	1
This product exceeded my expectations. Deer had been constantly invading my yard at nite time and eating the grass and plants.  The Scarecrow has worked perfectly and scares the deer away.  I ordered two additional Scarecrows to cover other parts of the yard. This product is a great value.	1
If you are having problems with birds getting in your pond and getting your fish than this may help. My pond is 25 feet by 11 feet at the largest end and so I purchased 2 scarecrows( one at first.) It would have worked with only one aiming down the length of the pond, which I tried first, but its area of motion is wide and it would not let me near the pond unless I turned it off. But of course, turning it off is very easy.  A simple knob is how you do that and there are numbers on the bird to remember where you had it set. I ordered another one and I placed them aiming across the width of the pond away from the main walking area. I can get to the edge of the pond but as soon as I reach in the water I get sprayed. If I walk around to the other side of the pond I get sprayed also. Doing it this way I get coverage past the pond to my back fence, about 25 feet, on setting # 5. I was having problems with white cranes, I live 2 miles from a lake in a residential neighborhood. I have had no more bird attacks in the 2 months of service. I just changed the battery, didn't need to, just did. By-the-way, the wind moving the leaves of large plants set it off sometimes. We are happy with our new protection it is only fitting we name them, Heckel and Jeckel . If you have a good imagination and you look just right, they kind of look like black birds, after you put on the stickers.	1
Depending on your need this can be a great product. I actually bought it long time ago to deter cats in my backyard. So that they do not try to steal my kois. But since it required a permanent garden hose connected to it all the time I did not use it. For last few weeks a heron has been stalking my fishes. He has not been successful yet but in desperation I brought out the scarecrow. I connected a pond pump to it instead of garden pipe and it seems to be working ok despite the low water pressure. I wish it would work as well with low water pressure as it does with high. Other than that, this thing works perfectly. Day or night. One other thing I wish it had was some kind of indicator that would show that it was activated. Maybe in next model...	1
This is a wonderful product! A neighborhood feral-cat-society suggested this to my neighbors, who were angry about stray cats in their yard and on the verge of doing something extreme. I don't mind the cats but we've had a terrible time with raccoons: we tried everything to get rid of them to no avail, and so I thought it was worth a shot to see if this might deter them from their digging up everything and their midnight raids of my peach tree and strawberry patch. And guess what? It works like a charm!  While raccoons like water in general, what they loathe is the suddenness, and the tick-tick sprinkler noise the Scarecrow makes, and they take off like a rocket the second it goes off, occasionally coming back to see if it's still there but basically leaving our yard alone.  My sister used it to deter a colony of feral cats from using her child's playhouse for a fort,, and I've suggested this to a friend as a possible remedy for his deer problem, because if the raccoons and stray cats bolt when it goes off, surely the deer will;he;s going to set it up this coming Spring and see. We must have tried every deterrent known to man and nothing worked, or else it worked for a day or two and the raccoons were back as soon as they got used to every new thing. We're so glad we bought our scarecrow, how nice it is to find a humane and effective solution to a really intractable problem!  The only reason I can't give it a fifth star is the fact that the angle and direction of the spray is difficult to control, with so I ended up soaking wet while wrestling it into submission when setting it up initially. (Its also important to remember it's there: my husband came back in to the house soaking wet a few times after taking out the trash at night.  o  ---------------------------------------------------------	1
This is a good way to chase off the wandering cats from the neighborhood. My only complaint is that there is not enough vertical control of the height of the spray. I have mine near the bird feeders and it was hard to adjust it so that it sprayed the cat, but didn't hit the feeders above. I had to tilt the whole unit down, which then affected the distance that the IR beam reached. So I won't give it 5 stars, but I will give it 4.	1
Until now, the only way to keep deer from eating my green beans was an electric fence which made tilling tough.  Tried all kinds of other deterrents: deer fencing (hard to till and something still nipped those beans), dog fur, blood meal, Liquid Fence but they never were satisfactory.  Finally tried the Scarecrow and we see deer footprints approaching the beans but they never get a bite in!  This is so cool and we have plenty of beans this year.	1
We have woodchuck and bunny problems in our garden and this is a great way to keep them out and our lawn watered!  Our dog will set it off and run like crazy so hubby gets wet, so we are having fun with it also!  So far, our tomatoes and my flowers are looking much happier and healthier.	1
After spending so much time and effort into our first square foot garden I was devastated when a few days later I went out and found areas where our neighbor's cat had decided to make a litter box out of our garden.  My solution to the problem was a shotgun, but my pro-animal husband refused and wanted to try a more humane effort.  So, I went to the local garden supply store and bought their recommendation - some granules that I had to sprinkle generously all around the border of the garden every 24 hours or whenever it rained.  Well, that did not work, every morning the cat had left me a present overnight.  After doing lots of research and before leaving for a week long trip (I was worried I'd come home to no garden at all) I finally decided to buy the Scarecrow. Now, I am a frugal person and it killed me to pay this much money for something to protect my garden (not to mention the overnight shipping charges, since I wanted it here before we left town).  The minute it came we opened it and my children and I went out and installed it.  I have to say we had so much fun "testing" it and trying not to get sprayed!  That night my husband and I heard it go off one time (it's right by our window).  We left town the next morning.  I was so nervous about what we'd come home to, but when we got home my garden was nearly perfect!  I could see one spot where it looked like that cat had started trying to do his business, but it wasn't very "finished" looking.  I dug up all around to make certain, but it was all clean!  It's been nearly 3 weeks now and my garden is still in perfect condition, no more kitty crap!!  So, overall, this sprinkler is worth every cent.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that I wish the stake was made of something more solid than plastic.  If you are debating over this, trust me, it will work and you will LOVE it!!!	1
This is the ONE thing that actually kept the deer out of our garden all last Summer.  All of the various repellents, sprays, dangly-things, and even electric fencing, only held Bambi and Bambi's mother off for a week at best, then they would either get used to them or (in the case of fences) just jump over them.  They can't seem to get used to this Scarecrow though - I guess it's just too unpredictable for them.  It held them off all season and I actually got veggies from my garden, whereas my neighbors got nothing but deer-droppings.  So I'm here to order another this year, to protect my flower garden as well.  (I'm also considering using one to ward off pumpkin-stealing pranksters at Hallowe'en - that ought to be a good "treat"!)  Oh, yah- that reminds me:  don't set this device up where the mailman has to cross its path.  Mail carriers can get a little grumpy about being squirted with water out of the blue - go figure... :)  --- Just editing this a year later to add: Not only is it still working (imagine that: getting an electronic product out of the potting shed after winter is over, putting in new batteries, and it STILL WORKS!) but the deer are also still completely put off by it.  Can't ask for better than that!	1
I found the scarecrow very easy to assemble and works as advertised.  I am very pleased with this purchase.	1
This item works better than expected.  I thought there would be too much background movement from foliage and a waterfall for it to work properly.  I was wrong.  The item was setup without any fuss and it just plain works.  Nothing's getting near my fish pond without a blast in the head.  The first item I received direct from Amazon was defective.  After calling tech support (very nice people), found out about a bad batch from the factory.  They immediately sent a brand new replacement item with no questions asked.  :)	1
We purchased one of these to take care of our hell-spawn (raccoon) problem. The coons were digging up the yard, eating new plants, and searching for grubs. They left piles of dirt on the walkway and destruction in their wake. We purchased a battery of these scarcrow things and lined them up to create a critter-free zone and voila! No more eviscerated plants, no more dirt piles, no more coons! Its expensive, but worth it.  The crow even works on dumb humans, like me! =-) I came home late at night from the movies and found quite a surprise when my sister turned this thing on forgetting I was still out. The scarecrow got me. Repeatedly. And I deserved it.  Whatever you do, don't forget to turn it off or the UPS man won't like you very much.  Awesome. Worth every penny.	1
This is the only thing I have ever seen that is effective against armadillos. These ugly little creatures can destroy a lawn or garden in one night. They are like flies, you kill one, 3 more take its place, but the scarecrow seems to at least chase them back into the neighbors yard. Since armadillos are active only at night, I put my scarecrow on a hose end timer that only turns on the water after dark so it just cliks when somebody walks by during the day. My only complaint is that is repels the armadillos humanely, I would prefer somethng that blasted them to pieces.	1
Little tough to calibrate.  I think it got me wet more than the critters :)  but that's because there's a sidewalk in close proximity to the "red zone".  It works well.	1
Low quality, I would not recommend. You won't be impressed. I wasn't very satisfied with the purchase. Sorry, but no thank you.	-1
We ordered this pool and it arrived in less than a week. I leveled the yard pretty good, but nowhere near perfect. I laid the pool out by myself in less than 1/2 an hour and had the pump connected in no time. The pool filled quickly with two hoses and in less than a day we were done. One word of advice is to spend a little extra and purchase the Intex salt water system!! This system was a breeze to set up and in 24 hours my pool was perfectly clear and balanced chemically and ready for my son to enjoy. If the saltwater system only lasts one year it is well worth it. It cost me 18 bucks in salt and another 20 for a timer for the filter pump and that's all. The surface skimmer works surprisingly well when hooked to the filter pump inlet. I will buy another when this one is finished being abused by my boy and his cousins. Great great product for a small amount of $$.	1
I have only had mine for 3 wks, but have used it daily. I did not level my ground, just picked a level spot. I did not use a ground cloth. Just set it up and got in. For 15 minutes a week I can balance chemicals and have sparkling clear water. The grandkids use it hard, and there have been no problems. I use it to cool off and relax after work. I am planning to get a bigger one next year and give this to my daughter. If I could give it 6 stars I would. We have never enjoyed something this much for so little money and work!	1
This pool is better then sliced bread. We are having a blast with it. We have the 16'. I can swim 3 laps each way-do a somersault and swim 3 laps the other way. I am exercising- and swimming several times a day with this pool. After reading the reviews-when we purchased it (for $[...].) from Toys R Us-I paid an extra $[...]. for replacement. So, if it doesn't store well-next year I can have it replaced for nothing. We set it up on our concrete patio. All we have in it is a floating chlorine holder with chlorine tablets in it. The water is clear. We did put carpet underneath it-which I like. Got the carpet for free from a carpet vendor's extra's from cuttings. All I can say is... I wish I'd bought one sooner! I haven't turned the air conditioner on once since I've been using it (I work from home)and we've been having a heat wave with days being at 100 degrees or more. Hubby and I set it up in a couple of hours (including laying the carpet). So. We LOVE it! :-)	1
this is a really light weight and handy trimming--i can use this and not feel pull on my should that has had surgery-easy to clean up and tuck away	1
Much more powerful than the battery powered model, but the string isn't up to the job as it frequently breaks.  Also while using it the plug loosened causing an electrical arc which melted some of the plastic.  My repair was to open the handle and wire in a male electric plug with a couple of feet of cord hanging out.  This allowed me to secure that cord firmly to the handle which solved the problem.  The unit should be designed with the plug on a cord and not fixed to the handle. An otherwise excellent unit.  12-11-2012 Bought some thicker line for it to rewind on the spool with the hope that the new line will hold up better.  Will let you know in the Spring how it works out.  Update 12-06-2013 Switch to .080" line worked extremely well.  Where I would ordinarily use 2 spools of line I only used 1/2 a spool.  Using the thicker line requires modifying the original spool by widening the hole through which the line is attached, and then restringing the line on the spool.  I used an appropriately sized screw to widen the hole, twisted the new line into the hole, restrung it, and was ready to go.  Sounds like more trouble than it was.	1
Bought the Grass Hog four years ago and spent a fortune on string. Unfortunately B&D charges an arm and a leg for the replacement spools and rewinding the spools by hand takes forever. To add insult to injury, the small clutch lever broke and there is no way to replace it. The clutch lever is the part that advances the spool, without it, there is nothing to stop the entire spool of string from unwinding when you turn on the machine. Since this part cannot be replaced, it will go into the recycle bin.  I also had problems with the string advancing properly every 10 minutes of trimming. I would have to stop the machine, turn it over, snap off the bottom cover and manually advance the string. I will NOT be buying another Grass Hog, now that my unit is broken, period.  Went to the hardware store today and looked at the top of the line Echo ($200). The hardware store clerk told me that the Echo can use 0.065 string (same as the B&D) but can also use the 0.08, 0.095, 0.105, and the new 0.130 string. The thicker the string, the more cutting power you will get along with the longevity factor.	-1
I purchased this electric trimmer since our gas powered one is just too heavy for me to use for any length of time. I used it the first day and had some troubles but discovered the spool of line that it came with was not wound correctly. I replaced the spool with a pre-wound spool that I had bought and it seemed to work okay. The second time I went to use it, I used it for about five minutes and it just died! Done..dead! It will be going back and you can believe I won't be buying another Black and Decker product. I wish that I had read all the complaints here before I purchased it. It would have saved me a huge headache! All the major components inside seemed to be made of plastic and melt under average use. Very poorly designed. This was a 2011 model.	-1
I absolutely loved my B&D weed wacker that i bought a second one for my rental property.  At the price you really cannot beat it.  This works great for wacking high grass, around borders and for edging along sidewalks.  I agree with the other comments that winding the string yourself is a pain so I buy the pre-wound spools.  I looked at getting a heavy duty one (gas powered) but not only are they heavy and sometimes difficult to start, almost all of them cannot also edge unless you buy an expensive attachment, and the attachments are almost always the steel blades.  I cannot use the steel blades because of my sprinkler system so this works perfectly.  Do yourself a favor though and buy a very long extension cable so you don't run out of power and have to hook up to a different outlet.	1
OK...let's be real. Amazon says the retail on this is over $90, but that can't be true! I've seen this at Home Depot for a little over $40. That being said, this is a nice little trimmer for the price. I have a small yard but with all the rain recently, the grass had gotten over a foot high in the back, and along the fence it was pretty thick. This thing knocked it out in no time. I like that it auto feeds the line. If you purchase the slightly more expensive pre-wound spools, you won't have the problem with line tangling. Only thing that could make this better is if you could adjust the height. I'm nearly 6-feet tall, so I have to bend slightly which causes a backache. But for the price, it can't be beat.	1
I've had my Grasshog for five years and I love it!  I can't swing one of the big gas weedeaters any more, and I've found that this electric one will do just about anything I ask of it.  In Oklahoma, that's a lot.  We have five acres to maintain, and the Grasshog cuts down everything except the toughest weeds.  Knee-high tough grass is a breeze.  It's lightweight and pretty well balanced, and the flip-over head is really nice for edging or running a vertical trim down a chain link fence.  I don't find that it uses an excessive amount of cord, but I must admit that I cheat and use a fine, heavy-duty line that will fit it.  I gave up on buying the spools of B&D line for it, since they don't last very long and are expensive. Some people have said that you need to wear long pants while using it, and I think that's a given for any weedeater. These things are not toys, and they can fling rocks, sticks and other debris.  Safety glasses are good also.  Better to be safe than sorry. I like the Grasshog so well that I'm buying another one for my mother.	1
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT TOOL THAT DOES THE JOB.  IT COVERS A FAIRLY LARGE AREA, SO THE WORK TIME IS CUT DOWN.  AS WITH ALL WEED WHACKERS, YOU HAVE TO WEAR GOGGLES OR EVENTUALLY YOU WILL HAVE AN EYE INJURY.	1
Very accurate description of product. Performed as advertized. Price was very moderate,Delivery was 100% accurate on time. Very pleased with Amazon shipping policy.	1
I'm not sure how the automatic string feed is supposed to work but it doesn't.  Save yourself much grief and buy a trimmer with the regular bump feed mechanism.	-1
I have owned this trimmer since last summer and have had no major problems. The head doesn't always click into place when switching from trimming to edging, but it's not a major malfunction and has just been a consequence of me using it so much. It edges really well for a handheld and cuts grass and most smaller weeds no problem. I wouldn't go after blackberries or saplings with it, but that's not what I need it for. If you're wanting to hack down bigger stuff, get a gas Stihl and be done with it. However that is $300 of overkill if you're just trimming a typical yard, nevermind making mix, starting it, maintaining it, etc. I wonder how many people on here that complain of melted gears or something going wrong are using the incorrect cord? If you use some cheap low gauge extension cord for your electric products, you will ruin them. The motor will overheat trying to pull current from the cord because the cord is too small to carry a sufficient load. That overheating will lead to melted gears or belts. I have used the trimmer for hours at a time and never had a heating problem. It also took me a long time to go through a spool, maybe too many people are attempting to log their back woods instead of trim around the landscaping? Make sure to check what gauge cord is recommended for your product. Also keep in mind things like resistance, you will need a heavier cord the farther you get from the plug.	1
I live in Florida and have St. Augustine grass.  This model (10 years ago) was my first edger/trimmer I ever bought and it worked like a charm for probably 7 years of light use before the spool broke and I "upgraded" to a Ryobi gas trimmer $120.  The problem with those gas trimmers, at least the non $250+ ones, is that their motors are only rated 30 hours, whereas this electrical motor can potentially last for years (previously lasted over 5 years (the spool broke but motor still worked), currently on year 2 for new one).  After my Ryobi gas trimmer died, I went back to this one and, wanting to save my $$$ for more important things, I opted for this model again.  Here are my thoughts on this electric Trimmer:  Pros: - Inexpensive: I paid less then $50 on sale and it edges & trims.  -Lightweight: my wife can easily use it.  -The edging is way better then my gas edger provided, it gives a deep and at least 1 inch wide edge which looks very nice.  -Motor is quiet compared to the noisy gas trimmers and lasts much longer.  -Trimming using the guard easily allows me to get in close to posts and mailboxes, etc, without damaging anything other then grass.  -Electric motor gives ample power for a maintained yard.  Cons: -Lots and lots of extension cords!  - It's a bit small for me (I'm 6'2") and I have to bend a bit.  I think if you're 5'11" or shorter, it's probably the perfect size.  - The string that comes with it is pretty weak and skinny.  Without the wire guide down, you could eat up string very quickly. (my original model didn't have the wire guide).  Also, I can imagine if you're using this as a brush trimmer, you'll be going through quite a bit of string.  -Restringing the spools is a bit difficult, and buying the pre-spun spindles can get expensive.	1
I live on two acres with lots of weeds plus have other property in AZ I use this little sucker on.  I also have gas trimmers that I try to stay away from as they are twitchy at best, and a royal pain at worst. If I can get the electricity I will use an electric trimmer anytime over a gas one. Auto string works if you wind the string properly (not beyond the little hole in the spool) (yup thats what its for) and as mentioned in another review, use another type of line, not the stock item and you will have much better luck.	1
I purchased my grass hog 700 last summer. I had no problems until I tried using it today. It advances line much to quickly I blew through 2 pre-wound spools. The line got jambed under the spool housing, I got the whole thing pulled apart and cleaned out some melted line in the works. I got it reassembled and try to go back to cutting old dead grass and the line fouls again. I'm done with B&D weed wackers- I've just ordered a Poulan.	-1
This thing goes through a spool every time I use it.  I ended up throwing it in the trash.  The auto feed doesn't know when to quit.  As it gets near the end it starts spewing out too much and ends up shooting the remaining string out at high velocity.  Useless, and dangerous.	-1
I am on my third Grass Hog and you'd think I am a real fan.  I have number 3 only beause numbers 1 and 2 died soon after buying each.  This one has not stopped working just some features like the bump thingy.  I will throw this device away as soon as I either get another trimmer or this one dies dead.  It, honestly, takes me twice as long to trim the yard by having to stop, undo the string holder, pull some string out, replace the holder and go at it.  If the bump worked this would be a 4 rated machine.  It can make it to 5 if someone at B&D comes up with a way to make a shaft long enough for folks over 5'7" tall.  If you are 6'3" I will almost guarantee a sore back from leaning over while trimming.	-1
I had too many problems with my gas trimmers, so I thought I would give this a try... All I can say is WOW WOW WOW...so inexpensive and less a pain. It just keeps on going....Make sure to get the Grass Gator Electric Multi-Fit or #6610 Electric Replacement Blades  ....much better than string in the long haul...  RECAP: Bought early 2008. It is June 2010 and this same weedeater is going strong!!! LOVE IT!!!! I am a single woman who hates all my gas weedeaters that never seemed to work. THIS $45 weedeater beat the ____ out of any of the expensive ones !!  I have no idea who posted negative reviews! they are wrong! the only issue is the power cord wants to come out. All you need to do is secure it with something.	1
As everyone else says, goes through string fast, but much better than bumping or manual string advancing.  I'm going to try re-spooling myself.  I was going to buy extra spools, but changed my mind after it went through the first spool in about only 1 hour of use.  Did not give it 5 stars due to few factors:  1) Not for tall people unless you like to hunch over.  Just right for my kids to use, but I am 5'8" and have to hunch a little even with the longest setting.  2) Bottom motor design makes the trimmer head heavier, which makes you have to push down on the back handle all the time, while holding the complete weight of the trimmer with the middle handle.  I rigged a shoulder strap to the middle handle, which improved the handling and weight distribution 100%!  Black & Decker take note: Make the unit longer and include a $2 shoulder strap!!!	1
After what I read about how Black and Decker trimmers use string, I decided to get another brand at Lowe's.  As it happened, the local store had only one other brand and the trimmer was not an edger too. So I was "stuck" with the Black and Decker. I had read that the grass hog GH1000 was a Consumer Reports Best Buy but I decided to get the cheaper one so I would lose less money if I had issues with string.  I've used it 2 days now and no problems with the string yet.  In fact, I've been pleased with how the string has fed so far.  I have used a gas trimmer with a straight bar for years now and it's a bit hard to get used to the contour of this one.  Guess that will come with time, though.  I also don't find the balance to be quite right; it seems a bit bottom heavy.  I suppose that is the result of having used a gas model with the engine at the top.  Again, I'll probably get used to it.  It's nice not to have to worry about cranking the gas model and it's a lot quieter.  Be careful with the cord, though.  Overall, I am pleasantly surprised so far.	1
I used to howl at this $&^@%! trimmer because the string feed mechanism wouldn't work. It would hurl shrapnel at my ankles. The string would break inside the cap in mere seconds. I would have to start and stop and start and stop the trimmer over and over, all the while fussing and fuming at the #*@*& B&D corporations. I felt like hurling the trimmer through a window. I bad-mouthed B&D every chance I could. And all along, I wondered how B&D could keep selling this wretched piece of junk.  And then--miracle or miracles--I went back and actually read the user manual, focusing on (a) the right string to use (round, not serrated) (b) the right way to wrap the string and (c) equally important, how and where to "park" the wound string temporarily (in those tiny slots), before closing up the cap and pulling the string tight.  When I followed the directions to the letter, the unit actually worked! And it continues to work several weeks later.  Yes, I still think the old bump-and-feed system was better, but if you follow the directions to the letter, this B&D trimmer does a credible job.	1
Cons: 1. Line feed does not work w/ replacement string. 2. Have to buy new spool to get line feed to work. 3. Use line very quickly, probably due to how powerful it is.  Pros: 1. Powerful 2. Great at edging 3. Light Weight	-1
I'm a middle aged female who purchased this trimmer because I maintain our lawn most of the year by myself (in Florida...long growing season) and I had problems starting the big gas trimmer. This was the answer for me...lightweight, easy to start, maneuverable. I have a 1/2 acre and after my first use I was not tired and I found that the extension cord is not difficult to manage. It remains to be seen if I'll have the spool and string problems mentioned by others, but for under $50.00 (new) this one has my vote!	1
GREAT	1
Exceeded my expectations hauls a sixteen ft canoe in the extended bed of my 2016 F150	1
Worked great! Used it to tie my boat down.	1
Great concept, poor execution... this rack was so sloppy where it fit into the hitch receiver. Would have been great if it didn't have sooooo much play in it!! Would have been overly concerned with using for any sort of distance...	-1
Just one of those tools that makes the job safer and easer. I loan it out all the time to my buddies. beats hooking up the trailer just to go get a few boards of lumber.  Also used it to carry my deer stand to the woods.	1
No clue how this junk has such a good ratings! Transported my 80 lb kayak twice, about 8 miles on the dirt road, going slow. It broke on the welds on my second trip. Garbage...	-1
This has made taking our 14 ft kayak to the lake a snap.  Easy to install, sturdy, works like a charm. I definitely recommend.	1
Using upright to attach kayaks in cargo rack.  Works great.	1
DOA right out of the box. Looks like it was dropped and snapped the tie down strap before it was even painted. Seems sturdy but giving a 1 star until the replacement arrives.  Also the "flag" is nothing more than a thin see through square of pink plastic. I think grocery bags are thicker than this thing.	-1
Wasn't sure if this would work as well as I hoped for the price, but it certainly does. Basic 2" box steel, long piece slides into the T for storage. Used it to carry a 12' canoe today and no problems. I wouldn't put a lot of weight on it, it only slides 2" into the hitch. Not a lot of steel there to secure it.  So far so good!	1
Great product!	1
This is slick, strong and affordable. I've already used it with my Honda Ridgeline to haul extension ladder (with Honda roof racks, easy to adjust to their height), 10' rebar and 12' kayak, both at bed level (was only taking kayak a couple of miles to loan to church for Bible school prop--longer and I'd have hauled it like the ladder.)  Is easy to install, adjust and remove & store. A great tool that I just stumbled on. I can see using it often.	1
Perfect for my kayak. Support is really good.	1
this works great on my Honda Ridgeline.  We're able to carry an extension ladder on the roof, or carry the canoe in the short bed.  Very useful accessory for our truck.	1
Use this to transport my 55 lb. 11' kayak  with my mid size mini van. I have enough room to transport two kayaks. (Trailers for Kayaks  a little pricey,)Bought this on Amazon, after reading it's reviews...  With Extender can transport Kayak either on top of vehicle or  inside it,  prefer inside  vehicle because of Kayak's weight.	1
Works good, perfect bed extender.	1
Solid, good craftsmanship.	1
This is an excellent product. While I haven't had an opportunity to use it for camping and probably never will for a canoe, I have used it for tailgating and mounting a TV you don't either end.  This is spectacular Prada for both uses	1
A+++ Good Value	1
We have a small truck, so we use this to bring our kayak to the beach. Works great. Ease to assemble and disassemble.	1
GREAT PRODUCT! GREAT SHIPPING!!!!	1
Fits my 2010 short bed Toyota Tacoma. It allows me to safely carry my 13.5' Ocean Trident 13 Anger kayak securely. The Kayak still sticks out about 4-5 feet. This bed extender should come with more reflector stickers as i do think its lacking. Its pretty heavy duty and I should get much use from it with my application.	1
One of us needs to show how easy this product is to store.  The main 90 section slides into the cross bar allowing this to be stored flat, taking up very little shelf space.	1
Great product, would definitely recommend!	1
Works great for hauling ladders	1
i doubted this device, bit after using it two weeks I'm convinced... For hauling wood from the lumber yard to hauling a canoe..this works!	1
YES!  I love it!  My canoe now goes right in the bed of the pickup.  This thing is stout, well made and easy to store.	1
Bed extender is easy to put on and take off and can be used for a variety of uses.	1
Not powdercoated (painted) and interior of tube easily rusts.  Also no reflective stickers or lights, but this is easily remedied with a little effort and about $20.	1
Great idea and a well made product that does what it promises.	1
Very happy with this product. Exactly as advertised. Sturdy, and the pieces fit inside each other for storage. Follow directions when hauling and you should not have any issues.	1
very handy for hauling	1
Works well, a bit tippy but once the thing is secured with ratchet straps it holds firm and works like a charm	1
works great	1
A great and versatile accessory! It is sturdy works as a bed extender or roof rack extender, and is easy to install and remove. we use it for our kayaks and to haul masts and lumber.	1
This is a good item. Especially for the money. I needed a way to transport 2 kayaks (14 and 16' long) in the back of my short bed pickup. The only complaint I could make is that the extender does have a bit of play up and down and side to side. I think the manufacturers recommend snugging it with tie downs if you want less movement. I would buy it again.	1
Tried it out this weekend for a camping/canoe trip.  The device was very easy to put together and figure out - it's just two pieces of metal with 2 pins for affixing.  It slips right in your receiver hitch, then you adjust the height to match your truck bed (or roof height if using up high).  I achieved a total of 12 feet from the front of my truck bed to the extender support bar, which is great for long loads (like a 16 ft canoe, or 16 ft lumber).  My canoe slipped right up there and fit perfectly.  It helps that it has 2 tie-down loops on the extender.  The entire assembly wobbles a little bit inside the receiver hitch, but can easily hold several hundred pounds of weight without bending, and the pins are heavy duty which also gave me assurance.  The included red plastic flag lasted 1.5 trips (total of 3 hours on the freeway) before it flew off, but I use orange flagging tape anyway so I didn't mind losing it.  The extender does have grey reflective tape on the pack, but your load will mostly cover it up, so it's kind of pointless.  I give it 5 stars for combination of price, ease of use, quality construction, and usefulness.	1
Perfect for carrying my kayak. Easy to install and a good amount of adjustment. Fast shipping and a great price.	1
Used this about dozen times since purchased and it works great. Folds up and easy to store. Would purchase this item again.	1
This is one of those products I don't use alot, but when I need to haul lumber it is worth it's weight in gold. Well built product, but does have it's limit with weight capacity, so use common sense when stacking lumber on it.	1
I use mine on my highlander suv in the upright position. I gets me the added length I need for my kayak to fit my rack.	1
Perfect for those times when you just need a few long boards,  could see it being used for other things too.	1
I use this on a short bed pickup  and can haul 16' boards safely and easily. Loading is easier to as you can work from the sides if needed. Well built, adjustable for about any configuration. Comes in two pieces so you can hang flat on wall .	1
Heavy duty, easy to install and use.  Comes apart in seconds for storage when not in use.  excellent for hauling a couple of Kayaks.	1
When you have a short box truck without a ladder rack and you need to haul something lengthy this item will help support it. Heavy duty enough to handle a heavy load and easy to install and adjust.	1
I saw this product being used to mount a boat in a short bed and thought it would come in handy. I got mine to haul lumber and ladders and it is great. I had a little trouble with some welds on mine and Darby Industries sent a replacement right out. Get some good ratchet straps and the locking hitch pin and haul away; you can not go wrong.	1
When I am going it alone, this extension makes loading my 14 ft. River Rat Canoe a breeze. I just set one end up on the T and then go back to the other end and slide it effortlessly into my pickup, which has a topper. Plus, it seconds as a bed extension for hauling just about anything that would normally be too long for my short bed. I've already used it to haul some long decking timbers.	1
This extender is a great buy, especially for Prime members.  It is simple and heavy duty.  It's also great that it can be converted to fit pickup trucks and SUV's.  My only improvement was to wrap some athletic tape around the cross bar so cargo would slide so easily or be scratched by the metal.	1
I purchased the Extend-A-Truck 944 Truck Bed Extender to haul our kayaks and provide proper hull support during transport.  I use it on my 2012 Ford SuperCrew pick-up with a 5.5 foot bed and it is perfect for transporting our two 12 ft kayaks and/or 15 ft tandem kayak.  The two piece design is great for storage and easy to set-up.  The size is perfect for what I use it for and it is adjustable for various trucks' bed heights.  The fit and finish quality is very good and the price for a high quality steel product was lower than at retail stores.  I am extremely pleased with the product and the Amazon purchase experience.	1
This truck bed extender is just what I thought it would be. It's versatile and well made. I recommend it.	1
Great product for home improvement jobs. Also great for loading on a small boat. Easy to assemble, use and store.	1
Got this as a gift for my husband.  Easy to install and our 15-foot kayak goes right on it and secures easily so we can take it anywhere without a roof rack.	1
This was exactly what I needed for transporting my fishing kayak in the bed of my F-150. Easy to assemble and works great!	1
So far so good.  Very sturdy product.  Was a little dirty and packaging was beat up but no damage.  I've only used it in the extended out mode, meaning not up mode.  I bought the foam pads that fit this product, they are pretty pricey but work great.  Update 9/16/13 I've used this product to carry my Tsunami 140 kayak on a 2012 base Toyota Tacoma PU dozens and dozens of times.  I can literally install the extender and load my 14' kayak in 5 minutes time.  I've traveled long distances and at 70 mph with no issues.	1
I bought these to haul my two kayaks.  Works great.  I would have given 5 stars, but it does not come with any reflectors or padding material.  Also, the flag it comes with was missing my first order, Amazon sent me a new one, but the flag is real cheap...just a piece of red thin plastic.	1
I have owned trucks for many years and gotten by with long lumber though not without some problems from time to time. I originally bought this for use with my kayaks which are 14' long to carry them in the back of the truck with its 6.5' bed. Instead I have been using this extender at least 3 times a month to transport long items.  The two pieces fit one inside the other and the overall length is short enough that I can store it behind the seat of the truck until needed. The tubing is heavy enough gauge to support the rated load with no flexing. The two pins needed to attach it to a hitch receiver and to connect the two pieces are provided. The cross bar as multiple holes so I could adjust it for the height of the bed of my truck.  There are end loops to use to tie a load and secure it to the bar. The center post also works well as an attachment point for lumber and pipe.  I saw similar racks selling for more than twice as much that provided often less strength and no more versatility than this one. Usually after I have tried something like this I see things that I would improve in the design but not so with this bed extender.	1
Works perfect for my 16' Mad River Canoe on my Toyota Tacoma.  No installation issues, pins fit perfectly in my Reese hitch receiver but would recommend to the company to supply pins that lock rather than the cheaper cotter pin version.  No way will I leave this investment sitting unsecured at a boat ramp and it is just to heavy/bulkly to take it off and stick it in the locked truck while I'm fishing.  I'm sure I could have found two locks that used the same key but in a pinch purchased two.  Five star's for this product if the company adds lockable pins but that may be too harsh given the price here.  Product works as advertised, locks would just put it over the top.  Also love the strap guides on the T.	1
I've used this to move lumber and a small rowboat.  I have a 2004 Tundra double cab with a 6' bed, 8' if you fold down the tailgate.  Using the Extend-A-Truck to make the bed longer, I found that it worked pretty well.  For 10' lumber, the T-bar is a little too far away, so in order to lash the lumber to the T-bar, your lumber is not flush against the front of the bed.  This means if you had a panic stop, the lumber might slide out from the tie down strap and come loose.  This won't be a problem for lumber longer than about 10' 6" in my setup.  I recently had to haul a big load of 12' lumber and I had forgotten to bring the Extend-A-Truck with me.  It worked OK without it, but I was regretting that I forgot the bed extender.  I think the tie down loops welded to each end of the T-bar are a little flimsy.  I'm reluctant to really ratchet down my tie down straps extra hard for fear that these loops might bend or snap off.  They are only about 1/8" diameter steel. Their placement also means that your bottom layer of cargo can't be any wider than 4' without interfering with the loops.  An improvement would be to use sturdier loops and place them on the sides of the T-bar so they are not in the way.  The two sections fit together alright, but the fit is not that snug.  The result is that the whole rig is a little "floppy" feeling until it gets tied down to something.  Also, while understanding the tradeoff between weight and strength, I think the designer erred on the side of light weight.  If there was some corner bracing or gusseting, or if the whole thing was made with a thicker gauge of steel, it would feel more appropriately sturdy.  When storing, it is natural to want to nest the long part of the hitch bar through the top of the T-bar.  This works OK, but it would work even better if the hitch pin hole was moved about 1/2".  As it stands, you can't use the hitch pin to lock the two pieces together for storage.  If you're not careful, the two pieces slide apart.  It seems like it is designed to specifically prevent you from doing this.  Overall, however, this is a very useful device, and I am happy with the purchase.  I've gotten positive comments from people at the lumber yard when loading up using this.	1
I have a F-150 crewcab - I am a woodworker and haul long wood on a regular basis.  This handles 16' - no problem.	1
Hitch extender is good for Kayak transport and allows me to secure slippery kayaks to bed, with minimal effort. There are rings on Tee, allow straps and Bunge Cords to effortlessly secure boats to bed.  After securing Kayaks in place with Rope and cords, this method of support and tiedown of ends of Kayaks just makes sense.  Good product, Well made and painted with good coating for corrosion resistance.  Stores easily or hangs from hooks on Garage wall, though it is somewhat weighty.  Yo lil' mamma will struggle to move it, but that's why you have one! Also mounts to support cab level or bed rack level loads like ladders. The ladies will like it's slender frame. You yakkers with hitches, should get you one!	1
This extender is nice for sure.  I use it when I pull out a sheet of plywood and rest it on the extender to create a work table behind my truck.  It would be nice if it was a bit longer though.  Also, the price is a bit high considering it's just welded steel with a painted finish.  Should cost about 50 bucks at most!	1
Purchased product because I have a short bed, 6.5 ft, on my pickup and the canoe I purchased was 16 ft long and I did not want to have to put the canoe on top of the truck all the time.  This product give me the option when I do not need to carry anything in the bed of the truck and makes it easy on loading the canoe.	1
I was skeptical about purchasing this product, but after using it, I can say..." WOW what a trimmer".  The reviews from other users was also a big plus.  Our yard is 15000 square feet, surrounded by a wire fence, trees, shrubs, sidewalks, all these require trimming, even though the instructions warned me not to trim too close to the wire, I wanted to try it anyhow, it worked great, but I would not make a habit of this.  It is so easy to use and lightweight, just a flick of the trimmer and you have an edger, and it really makes a nice groove between the sidewalk and the grass.  It is also easy to maneuver in tight or small places, one speed and not loud like some gas trimmers.  So easy to start, no pull cord, I have bursitis in my shoulder and I no longer have to deal with the pain associated with pulling a cord.  It takes about 16 hours to charge and its ready the next time I have to use it, I would recommend this to anyone.	1
True story, I had a Troy-Bilt four-stroke weedeater from one of the home improvement stores that cost around $200 that was impossible to start.  I hated it.  Once it was going, it was difficult to manage and would often "grab" the ground and dig into the grass and was generally frustrating to use.  I hated dealing with the spool too.  A few weeks ago I went to do some trimming and tried to start the weedeater.  I grew tired pulling the starter cord several dozen times and sat down on my steps to continue trying to start the weedeater.  As I pulled back with all my might, I forgot about the cast iron railing on the side of my steps and clobbered my hand.  I instantly had a golf-ball sized lump on the back of my hand and I saw red.  I picked the weedeater up over my head and smashed it repeatedly onto the ground, destroying it.  I should have done it a long time ago.  I told a friend about it and he said, "You know what I did that has been the best thing ever when it comes to weedeaters?  I bought a battery powered weedeater."  Hmm, I don't like electric when internal combustion is an option.  But I trust this friend and I decided that I was fed up with gas powered weedeaters - so I gave it a shot.  Enter the American Gardner 24 Volt Cordless Trimmer.  Best thing I've ever done when it comes to garden tools.  I even paid too much (when I came back to write this review the price has dropped $30!!!) and it arrived a little beat up by the UPS guy.  But BOY DOES IT WORK.  It has exactly the right amount of torque so I can control it easily and it cuts the grass, but does not dig into the grass or pull itself into the turf.  It requires NO PULLING OF ANY CORDS to start.  It just comes on when you press the button.  The spool works excellent and is easy to use.  I found it wasn't chewing up the wire as often as my gas powered trimmers tend to use up the line also.  It is just ideal for around the house grass trimming.  Now I will say that it does not have the power for serious weeds with wood-like trunks.  But for GRASS TRIMMING this is ideal.  I also tried to run the battery down the first time as this seems to be recommended for maximum battery life, but I gave up after 30+ minutes of continuous use.  It was still running strong.  In short, this is REALLY worth getting if you have a basic house with grass trimming that needs to be done.  For the price it is a STEAL right now, and it is well worth even the nearly $100 I originally paid.	1
Last year I retired my gas trimmer (too many expensive tune-ups, noisy, polluting, keeping 2T fuel a nuisance ) and bought the YardStick.  It does an excellent job on my small lawn, and I have even used it for clearing long grass on a steep bank that I am attempting to reclaim (it worked, but was struggling somewhat).  Contrary to other reviewers, I don't find it heavy or badly balanced, and it has two huge advantages.  The first is the quick head rotation, switching from edging to trimming instantly.  The second is the guide wheel, just above the spool, which allows me to maintain sharp edges without "wandering" into the lawn proper.  But two cautions.  The first is that it is fully mounted into the charging bracket when it is off-vertical!  If you put it on vertically, see a green light and think you're alright, you'll be disappointed.  Make sure it's slightly tilted and showing a red light, and you'll get a long running time per charge.  The second is that it is definitely not an edging tool.  Form your edges with a proper cutting tool, and then use the YardStick to maintain them, or you'll be frustrated by the slow progress and will use line by the mile (I pull out the line manually fairly frequently, and so avoid the nuisance of rethreading after a break).  I strongly recommend this trimmer, without hesitation.  2010 updates:  First:  many reviewers complain about short battery life.  See my comment above about the counter-intuitive way of plugging it in for recharging.  Second:  I have just bought my second Yardstick (batteries died on the first one, after a lot of hard use).  The line broke every few feet of edging.  Remedy:  throw away the line that comes with the machine, and replace with 0.080" commercial grade shaped line (standard bulk supply from Home Depot).  Today I completed my edging with no breaks, compared to 10 with the line supplied.	1
This product was listed as new but appeared to be an open box item.  The trimmer is easy to use and was in good working condition.	1
I am a small woman, and I just could not use those gas weedeaters.  They were too bulky and heavy for me to pack and I had trouble pulling the cord to get them started.  I'd heard bad things about the electric models, so I didn't even bother trying those. Although this is not lightweight, it is not unmanageable for short periods of time.  I do quite well with it actually. You have to have a place to screw the charger into a wall and the trimmer hangs up nicely out of the way, while charging. I just love it!  The cost to replace the batteries are $25.00, if that issue ever comes up.  I hope it lasts because I really needed a weedeater like this.	1
It's too heavy, unbalanced, doesn't keep a charge very long, the cord keeps breaking and it won't serves as an edger.....it trims fair and is cordless....so if that's what you're after BUY it....if not, stay with what you have.	-1
battery always charged to full power within 2-3 hours.  However, spent 2 years chasing the line inside the spool because it would not feed line when prompted.  Tonight, finally had enough and smashed against a tree!  I am buying a Black & Decker Hedgehog!	-1
As others have noted, you only get about 15 minutes of use with heavy weeds and about 45 minutes with light cutting for every 24 hour charge.  That works fine for me as I get tired.  The YardStick is not as strong as our gas powered weed eater but that big boy wears out the men in an hour and I can't even hold it for a minute.  So I use the YardStick for the little stuff and let the men do the rest.  An addendum written a year and a half after I bought this trimmer.  It still works just as well as when I bought it.  I still only use if for about 20 minutes at a time but that works well for me.	1
I enjoy using the product and it does a great job for me.  Yes I had trouble with the string cutter and with the string advance, but found by rewinding it carefully it works fine.  I purchased a second yard stick after my first just quit working after 1 year of heavy use.  I think it is a switch or some other electrical problem perhaps the resistor.  I find the price exceptional for a well made product and bought another because I enjoy using a trimmer that is quiet and doesn't use smelly gas/oil mix.  The edger worked great for me.	1
Mr. Bar-B-Q is the perfect addition to your grill tools.  The veggies turn out incredible well.  Easy to turn and roast. Only word of caution is the size the a full 12 inches and is a little too big to close the top on my Weber 386002 Q-100 Portable Gas Grill.  TIP: Spray with PAM before grilling to make clean up a breeze!	1
I love it	1
I use this as a charcoal tray for a smoker that came with a poor one. Perfect for that use.	1
Never put a teflon device on a grill if you let the heat go over 400 degrees.  This is just plain stainless so it's a better solution for grilling anything at high temps. Also, stainless will give you good browning performance.  We just toss veggies in olive oil and put them in this thing an then use a spatula to stir them occasionally while running the grill full blast.	1
excellent to use on the grill! love it.	1
Great grill pans, excellent price! Actually using this purchase to hold the burning charcoal in the bottom of the grill while cooking which seems to give a hotter, concentrated fire using less charcoal & makes ash/ember clean up really easy	1
tried it out on charcoal grill last night. The veggies turned out as expected. The metal did not get very discolored and definitely did not warp. It seems pretty solid, not flimsy and thin,  I'd recommend it, especially at this price. - how do these people make any money?  BTW, easy to clean if you spray a little whatever on it.	1
I bought a Char Broil vertical smoker that I simply could NOT get to stay over 160 degrees or so. On recommendations in reviews I found out about this product, and it literally saved the smoker from the trash heap :-) Before this wok I was concerned that the inexpensive brand charcoal I used was the source of my temperature problem, now I'm certain it was not AND I do not have to buy expensive designer charcoal I thought I would need to cure the temperature issue.  The smoker EASILY gets to 300 degrees now, likely because the coals do not get smothered by their own ash, because it's bigger than the OEM round bowl adding wood or more charcoal if needed is MUCH easier.  Since the "wok" bottom has holes in it, I do not want a major ash cleanup problem, so I lined the bottom of the smoker with foil. I also put the OEM charcoal pan lined with foil under the "wok" as well. Cleanup is a snap.  If you have a vertical smoker this "wok" (if it fits your smoker) will pay for itself the first couple of bags of charcoal you buy because you'll save a bundle on it!	1
Great for the veggies, we love it, smothered in butter, I call it arson on the grill !	1
Made real well.	1
It's a great Wok, but I got it per online recommendations for a charcoal pan for my Brinkman Smoker. It fits perfect. I did use it as a wok once, and it cooked my veggies great.	1
Arrived fully wrapped in clingy plastic wrap - no signs of damage from shipping, BUT ... one corner is not welded or soldered and is loose. I have to return it. If they welding is that sloppy, I would imagine the whole thing couldn't last through one season of use.	-1
Very well-made. Since this is a gift item, I am not certain about it's performance on the grill...but, it is nice and heavy weight and a good size for grilling veggies or smaller proteins that might slip through the grill slats.	1
as described	1
This has to be my absolute favorite accessory for the grill. Very sturdy and easy to clean. I use it to grill my peppers and onions for fajitas. I also like to grill peppers, onions, mushrooms and zucchini with a bit of garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper. Makes a yummy side dish.	1
product as described	1
Used this as an upgraded charcoal pan for my smoker.  It's holding up great, very well made, and works perfectly.	1
Used this to replace the charcoal bowl in my new 'Char-Broil 14201876 Vertical 365 Charcoal Smoker'. The handles are the perfect width to slide onto the original charcoal rack rails with zero modification. Now the coals receive an even amount of air and don't snuff themselves... plus I can give this basket a quick shake to drop any built up ash and let the coals keep burning steadily.  I also tried the Weber brand version of this basket, but the slit-style holes in that model were not as good for airflow as this Mr. BarBQ basket. The weber works well for shrimp on top of the grill, however.  I never actually used this basket on the grill, but it is sturdy, reasonably sized and made of decent stainless steel, so it should function at least as well over the fire as it does under the fire.	1
I use this grill basket a couple times a week in am really happy with it.  I dice up peppers and onions and throw them in to this basket with a little bit of olive oil and it makes it so easy to grill them perfectly.  I don't bother cleaning and I just leave it on my grill.	1
Used this for the bottom of a smoker in place of the pan that is came with. Works and fit perfect.	1
Use it to hold charcoal for a brickman smoker fits into coal rack perfect better than tray they give you let's air so the coal ash drops	1
This has made grilling vegetables enjoyable. The sides are high enough that you can flip and stir them without spilling over. The stainless will get dark and ugly but that doesn't bother me, what bothers me is unless you really clean it well tiny bits of burned marinade releases from the myriad holes and will get all over the food. Bottom line is make sure you clean it very well between uses.	1
I used this as a charcoal pan for my Charbroil 365 vertical smoker.  It really helped get the temps where I needed them by allowing the charcoal to breathe.	1
I bought one of these about a year ago and it is used constantly.  It works perfectly and cleans up easily.  As it gets older it gets a brown patina on it that makes it non stick.  I can get my son to eat squash and zucchini when I cook it on this.  Cut up the squash and zucchini into 1" to 1" cubes, coat with some canola oil, sprinkle some Creole seasoning on and toss.  Cook over high for about 4 or 5 minutes and it's delicious.  We also cook other vegetables and shrimp in this.  Everything turns out great.  This has become a well used piece of cooking equipment at our house.  The only thing I would recommend is have some GOOD pot holders because the handles get very hot.	1
This is a nicely made wok topper for "stir-fry grilling" vegetables on your barbecue pit; it's also great for cooking fragile fish or shrimp-and-veggie combos on any outdoor grill.  Made of high quality stainless steel, I like the fact that this is nicely rigid (meaning it won't "fold up" on you while you're removing it, steaming hot, from the grill) and the holes are large enough to allow for quick cooking, but small enough to keep all the veggies in the wok, not in the fire.  And the stainless steel surface means it doesn't have a chemically treated surface (like teflon).  Yes, you'll have to work a little at cleaning it, but it's well worth it to be able to cook your food cleanly and "au natural."  My husband likes to use it to grill sliced onions and mushrooms (laced with melted butter and lightly salted before putting on the grill) while the steaks are cooking--it perfumes the meat while the grill lid's closed & they're a great accompaniment to your finished steaks.  Great price & great value--very happy with ours!	1
Works great as charcoal box replacement. Fits right into the grooves. The smoker itself sucks though. Save yourself the $70 and buy something else	1
I have a 'vertical' square Brinkman Smoker and I haven't been able to get the temperature up to 250 degrees. One of my web searches suggested cutting holes in the charcoal pan for more air OR getting a vegetable grill pan. I thought this Wok Pan might work. I received it today and it is AWESOME. It is quite heavy and well made! The 'handles' on this Wok-Topper slide in where the other charcoal pan goes for a perfect fit!..and it will hold plenty of charcoal.  It is going to give the charcoal much more ventilation which will increase the temperature of my smoker. If I wasn't using this Wok-Pan for my smoker, I would still be thrilled with the QUALITY of this pan for grilling vegetables, etc. Outstanding price on this quality, heavy, well made pan.	1
This wok is very nice and heavy.  Costs twice this at my local hardware store.	1
perfect!  Just make sure you have a big grill.  When you are using this on a weber 22" there is little room for anything else.	1
I will recommend this one as it is heavy and very good bbq tray. I have found it easy to clean too (ofcouse you need one of those metallic scrubs).	1
This is a great product for grilling anything that might fall between the grill grate, like veggies, or fish.	1
Great for frozen pizza in the oven.	1
Its great quality, but the handles make it too wide to fit into my smoker. I may just cut the handles off.	1
Great rack for small or delicate things... veggies, shrimp, fish, etc	1
Well made, works a expected, good product, I would recommend if you need to grill small things.	1
Love this for a tray full of grilled veggies and onion slices ....	1
Excellent fish grilling overlay	1
This grill topper is really good!  I can grill sliced veges, shrimp, items that can easily slip into the gas burners. I love to grill sliced veges with a marinade and I was having trouble keeping them on top of the grill. Since I've been using this grill it is so easy. I gave the grill a 4 star rating rather than 5 stars because after using, the grill topper blackens. Even after scrubbing, the original silver color does not come back. However, the grill still does the same good job! I recommend it.	1
Purchased this to use on the BBQ when I'm smoking up my famous 3 lb meatloaf.  Usually when I smoke a meatloaf I'd use a disposable foil pan that I poked holes in for grease drainage, use once and throw away.  With this item I'll get good smoke penetration on the bottom, SIDES, and top of the loaf!  And of course, I'll use this for many other things on the grill as well - I like the idea that I'm not tossing things away after one use!  This item has a little "lip" on 3 sides, with one side without a lip.  Item is not flimsy, it is a strong, well designed grill topper - NO SHARP EDGES.  Yeah....this is going to be a well-used item on my grill  :)  Peace, Love, and BBQ !	1
Stainless steel, so I don't have to worry about the finish chipping or wearing off, and it seems to be made of slightly thicker material than others I have seen.  Yes, stainless will discolor after it gets hot, but that is the character of the material, it is not in any way harmful, except that it no longer has its 'new' look.  Works well, and should last a lifetime.	1
This was just what we needed! we use it on our grill for everything from veggies to meats! cleans up easily! would recommend this!! great price, too!!	1
looks good this was a gift	1
For the price ($15 I think, tho I've seen it in a brick n mortar for $9.99), this is a great item if you enjoy ridding your spaces of flying things. Its on the flimsy side but holds up to normal swinging.	1
Love this thing! Zap those flys!!! Fry them!	1
Works great and very durable. Purchased other models that didn't work or fell apart after minimal use.	1
Works good , had better	1
I have on each floor.	1
this is my 3rd one.  the handle and battery cover have a flimsy feel to it, but the single layer screen is lighter than the others.  it has 2 buttons to depress simultaneously which is a hassle, so i superglued one of them permanently, and gorilla glued the handle so it wouldn't wobble.	1
GREAT device to have in southern middle TN, where the bugs are plentiful !	1
Never worked. Not even once.	-1
Fun to fry the bugs!	1
Bought this one for my sister-in-law. I have owned many of these over the years. Love them. They will not last forever but are a good value. They work great on spiders also.	1
Second one i've owned, the first lasted many years,only had to replace push button switch and of course batteries. Very effective on mosquitoes.	1
Great zapper for the annoying flying insects.  Be ready for the loud POP when you hit the little beasties.  This handle did come apart after a week but we're mechanically inclined and just tightened everything up, maybe glued a piece.  It works just fine now, a month later, and hasn't come apart again.	1
It works!  I use it on fly...	1
Incredible how strong the zap is on this!...even from only 2AA batteries.  Fries moths, bees, ants, etc...	1
great!!!	1
The manic fly ran into it - then dropped, lights out. Nice that it features a safety switch.	1
"Red Game Over Version" I've owned several different tennis racket zappers of this general idea, and this was by far the worst one.  It's design is problematic with the large sections of plastic in the middle, and additional safety wire mesh covering the zapping element.  The result of this design is as you swing the racket, it just pushes air and sends the bugs flying away from the racket never coming close to the zapper.  The battery compartment is also too laerge and if you swing the racket a few times, the battery comes loose and now the thing isn't even on.  Not that you can notice very quickly since it is so pathetic in actually zapping a bug it might take a while before you even realize it's off.  It's being returned.	-1
Great product, just as described.	1
Death to the winged insects!  I live in an 1899 Victorian with nearly all of the original windows still in place. This means, joy of joys, that I get to go wasp-hunting every year from early April until late September.  The electric bug swatter is awesome at killing flies, mosquitoes, and those loathsome wasps.  It is also extremely satisfying to watch the creatures pop and sizzle on the wire mesh.  Note: With wasps, one little zap does not do the job. Let those puppies sizzle for a good 30 seconds or more!	1
Came missing screws. Zero quality control.	-1
I live in a mosquito infested area and they frequently get indoors.  This is the greatest invention since air conditioning.	1
Crap as soon as I put batteries in. the side buttons that turn it on did not work had squeeze them really hard and all it would do is turn on and of constantly	-1
I originally bought this as somewhat of a gag gift for my husband. It's actually pretty cool, though!	1
Great Stuff. Lots of fun and get rid of those pesky skeeters too. I've bought a bunch of these for every room in the house including the garage and porch. One out of four has a manufacturing flaw but I was able to fix or work around the problem and make it work for me. That means that the manufacturers quality is just outright disgusting. When you have a 25% failure rate that means you don't give a flip. Regardless, the ones that work, work really well and do a fine job. Not a bad price for a unit that will make you smile every time it goes smack!	1
junk	-1
I love killing pests with this thing. The flies never feel the compression wave of the flyswatter coming toward their bodies so they don't flinch, and they die.  In fact, just two nights ago, I saw two flies on a plastic glass and got this flyswatter, swung it gently toward the top of the glass, and the flies actually flew TOWARD the flyswatter, being killed instantly. ALSO, this flyswatter is a MUST-HAVE if you are traveling to Alaska from the lower 48 by car. There are no rest areas like the ones in the lower 48, but outhouses dotted along the road every few hours. The mosquitoes in Canada and Alaska can carry off small pets! (Not really, but that's the impression they give.) They are THICK in the summertime, and if you leave your car, you had better have one of these in your hand to wave around to kill as many as possible.  (Hint: when traveling to an outhouse, before using the outhouse, wave this flyswatter around to kill the mosquitoes before you sit down and keep it on as you do your business; otherwise, you will be eaten alive and lose a pint of blood from mosquitoes dining on your lifeblood.) This flyswatter is a necessary part of our farm life, too.	1
It only worked for one day. I found it awkward to use, especially for bugs on the window. Then it turned out bugs smell when they're fried, and I didn't like that. Gave it away.	-1
Love this bug zapper!!!! Hate flies!!!! Works perfectly every time.	1
Does the job. Zaps the flies.	1
July, 2016 Update:  THE GOOD: We have used a variety of these tennis-racquet bug zappers at home and in our RV, and this is the best by far.  The others didn't pack the same punch, and required much more skill in trapping the bug between the paddle and a window, furniture, wall, etc.  This one will typically disable or kill the bug with any contact.  I also like the fact that you have to depress 2 buttons at once to gat the juice flowing; seems like a good safety feature to avoid inadvertent shocks to operator, pets, kids. Good battery life. THE BAD:  This product is flimsy and fragile.  On both of the ones I've ordered, the battery door will not stay shut---I tape it.  And my most recent one fell about 2 feet onto the floor, and the racket rim shattered and all the little wires fell out.  BOTTOM LINE:  It works so much better than the other brands, I'll just be more careful and plan on replacing as needed.  Hope the manufacturer upgrades the quality. Each time one breaks, it loses one star in my updated review.	1
very good real happy	1
I had a "Superhigh Voltage But zapper"  for last 5 years plus without even replacing battery and worked fine.  The only problem is it sometimes make popping noise itself.  But this model from Amazon had some problems.  First the area between head and grip is too thin that it is about to break up.  I had it just about a week.  Second, the gap between voltage lines are too big.  The trapped mosquitos sometimes still alive and run away.  The old model used make popping noise whenever flies and mosquitos were in trap so I know that those insects were in trap and killed in one shot.  Don't buy cheap one.  Small insects don't die in first contact because only wings were touched between the huge voltage line gap.	-1
Works great.only needs two AA batteries and is very quiet. You notice upon contact with an insect a small spark and the job is done .	1
This one works just as well, if not better, than the one that costs twice as much. I have tried multiple different brands and styles of electric fly swatter. What I have learned is to never spend more than $10 on one. I tried the one with the rechargeable battery, it doesn't last. I tried the ones that are twenty dollars, it didn't last. This one looks almost just like the $20 one. So far it's worked awesome! I use it on flies and fruit flies. There is a definite technique to killing each type of fly. Don't be discouraged if you aren't successful at first, just keep refining your technique. You don't need to swat very fast for the fruit flies, the speed just pushes the air and them away. But you need to be pretty fast for the regular flies. Be careful if you are going to strike them while they are sitting, if you swat too hard you'll break the swatter.	1
Instant gratification. Buy it now...	1
very good	1
Great little bug zapper that real takes care of those pesky gnats, yellow jackets and mosquitoes	1
You have to hold down two buttons when using . The head is small	-1
Doesn't really work	-1
I had one of these before but it had 1 button, this one has two buttons you have to push and that makes it more difficult to nail a fly while you're holding down a button on each side of the unit. Maybe they put two buttons on it for safety reasons but I'd rather have one, I wouldn't recommend buying this, it's to difficult to use.	-1
The dual buttons are a good idea because these zappers can be a two-edged sword.  Have used this one only once, and it was fast and, dare I say it, humane.  After all, they didn't ask to be cockroaches, and the slow death of bug spray seems a little uncalled-for.  Plus, the fumes are not good for humans or pets.  My last zapper (made by a different company) lasted about five years.  This one is new, so for now I'll give 4 it stars.	1
I used these over 20 years ago while living in China. They worked well for all of the different insects I wanted to eliminate. The ones in China used a 9 volt battery and only had on button to push to turn it on. These are meant to just touch the insect not swat it. With the proper care they should last a long time. A number of bars in the area I was living had them for customers to play drinking games with or to make sure your buddy was awake. These will give you a good harmless jolt. They are not meant for children. Have Fun!!!!	1
I have owned not less than five different models of similar devices, including this one.  For my purposes, this is the best ever, requiring much less swing to draw the offending insect into the web.  This one is also easier to clean.  It kills small pantry moths, and everything bitter.  I suspect it would do less for fruit flies.  If you want one for fruit flies, I recommend the three/layer style.  Probably the best feature of this model is the dual buttons, meaning that you cannot activate in error.	1
Arrived quickly & it was perfect!	1
if you have any flies around--you need this--love mine-better than smashing flies on the ceiling or furniture	1
I have derived immense pleasure in using this handheld bug zapper. It works as it should. There is a red light to show that the button is pressed down and it is activated to zap.  I never knew that there could be soooo much pleasure to skillet an annoying fly or larger bug on this thing. You know the bugs and mosquitoes that love to buzz around your head and face rather than just stay in another corner of the room minding their own business as you are minding your own business? Well when they enter my room and zoom around my personal space, they have buzzed around the wrong person.  I have good batteries in this thing- ready to zap. If they batteries are low it will take longer to kill bigger bugs. For mosquitoes and some small flies I hold it close to them with the button pressed down- it is like they are drawn into the grill by an electromagnetic field...and they are zapped. For the bigger ones (like Palmetto Bugs, ughh!) I have to to tap them with it or hold the racket down on them when they land on a surface. I do not slam it down like a fly swatter because the plastic racket would break. What I do is move swiftly to trap them while the button is pressed down but no force needed. Once they are pinned underneath there I just let them fry holding down the button or flip the racket over with the bug attached and skillet/saute a bug. lol Gross, but true!   I have had this since 2010 since then I added a bit of tape on the battery door (because I dropped in once and the plastic bit to secure it  broke off) also some of the metal bars popped out- but I popped them back in. It still works fine even though it took a fall.  Yes this is not a toy! I had to test it's effectiveness... I held down the button and just barely touched the metal. It was a zap and I was surprised by the intensity. No wonder this can be used for a roach grill - again sorry that's so gross, I know, but it will not be bothering me again, that's for sure. ;)  I have learned that instantly eliminating those types of bugs with the Charcoal Companion Amazing Handheld Bug Zapper PBZ-7 has been a source of twisted pleasure. I hope you will enjoy it to. I highly recommend this one.	1
great price/product	1
Fried mosquito or other bugs coming you way. Especially when the little buggers explode.	1
I love this product.  Funny thing.  When my dog sees it come out he gets excited because he gets a treat.  Gross but funny.  He did it on his own.	1
The previous version of this bug zapper served me well for over ten years (until the batteries leaked). I don't enjoy electrocuting critters, I don't do it for fun, but I can't stand house flies, fruit flies, no-see-ums, silver fish and spiders in the house. The zapper is neither too long, nor too heavy and the head is just big and long enough.  The previous version had one button which worked really well. This model has two, supposedly for safety's sake, but placed in awkward positions, one on each side of the handle. By the time one figures out hand-placement, the bugs are out of sight. Hence, minus one star for that factor. Uses 2 AA batteries which will stun big flying bugs, causing them to fall to the ground and fry no-see-ums. Trouble waiting to happen for people who allow their kids to use them as toys. This is not a toy.  Note: not sure about the color yellow... the bugs seem to know what's coming the second I pick it up.  07/2015 - racket cracked in neck. Quality has definitely gone downhill, the plastic is much more brittle. Rated down Looking for replacement. Sometimes they should leave well enough alone.  01/2017 - racket cracked in two. Will not be buying another of these. Bummer.	-1
Works wonderful	1
I wish they would make these curved so they fit in a corner. otherwise it is great. I own several of them, hubby uses one outside for wasps when he working in shed, even bought one for my church, wasp seem to keep finding their way inside and instead of people getting stung or jumping out of their pews (funny)  I can quietly (well not so quietly) zap it without a lot of commotion.	1
These are great.  Bought as a replacement.	1
Way better then the ones with the protective metal grid in front of them! Kills bugs instantly.	1
This is perfect for killing flying bugs and insects of all kinds. My first one was given to me as a joke gift from my grandson, because I was not that swift with a regular fly swatter and it proved to be a perfect tool for riding the house of flys and mosquitos as well as tiny flour moths. I let my daughter have it and got a new one for myself. Also ordered one for my best friend. We all use them and are happy with how well they work.	1
Not sure how this got such a great review earlier because it is very flimsy. Would not purchase another one.	-1
poorly made, the switch contacts were not working until I fiddled with them. It also doesn't seem to have much power, it does not give the satisfying 'POP!" that the one we had before had ("The Executioner"). It does manage to kill moths, haven't tried it on flies yet. I wouldn't feel confident against a wasp with this.	-1
No mercy, every flying insect is put on notice with these. They work well, though the battery compartment could be more secure. I bought a handful of them, and everyone who comes to my home wants one.	1
after a recent remodel the windows were open for days and people were coming in and out.. i was swarmed with tiger mosquitoes.  they bite multiple times and are really fast so very hard to kill.  best method was to just sit here and let them come to me.  zap zap zap and gone.  it's oddly cathartic.	1
The first one was a gift so I got to be embarrassed when the recipient gave it back never working. I got her another one. It also arrived not working. I took apart the first one and a wire's solder had come loose. I got mad and threw it away. The recipient's hubby wants to solder this second one. I'm embarrassed and disappointed because I have the same model that I got years ago at a store in another state and its been great all this time. If this one fails, I'l wait until Spring and get one at Walmart.	-1
Good gag gift, but breaks very quickly.  The metal mesh pops out easily.  Not made to last more than a month with children around. Fun to smack people with though.	-1
It was broken right out of the box and I returned for a full refund.  It looks like a good product.  I think I just got unlucky with a broken one but I bought one locally and it worked.	-1
Love this!!  Sitting on the back patio it has become a game to swat the flies out of the way.  Lot's of fun and gets the job done.	1
Worked well against flying insects, that is the ones that are large enough not to be able to pass through screen.  Will not zap fruit flies, gnats, no see em's, or small flies.  The two switch method is awkward in the fact that it makes you concentrate on the hand and finger position on the handle and not on the fly killing.  One mishap or slip of concentration and the brittle plastic racket hits a hard object or wall, it is finished.  The switch connections are cheap, one actually stuck in the on position, while the other still worked as designed.  After that switch malfunction happened, the unit worked a couple more times, then just quit.  After taking the handle apart trying to figure out what was wrong, I just gave up and chalked it up to cheap unreliable design.  I am buying the Terminator zapper next.	-1
Found one cheeper in town after I had recived this bug zapper look before you buy some times you might fget it cheeper in town:-(	-1
This item and similar products are usually marketed as novelties, but I have found mine to be an indispensable tool.  That's because your basic flyswatter is incomplete since it requires a nearby flat "killing surface" to get the job done; if the flying bug in question refuses to cooperate by landing on or flying slowly near such a killing surface, a flyswatter is useless.  On the other hand this tool can take care of insect pests flying in the middle of the room, next to things that cannot safely be swatted, or outdoors.  This particular model has a couple of buttons that must be pressed and held down simultaneously (by thumb and forefinger) in order to charge, which happens almost instantaneously, and a red LED to let you know it is ready, all of which contribute to extending battery life.  Despite my son's bug hunting safaris, I'm still on my first set of two AA batteries.  Use is basically the opposite of a flyswatter: move it slowly until the grid touches the insect pest (there will usually be a visible flash).  Cleanup in most cases involves wiping with a tissue.  Obviously, the larger the bug, the less likely you will kill it outright with the first charge, but at the very least this thing will knock it to the ground.  I would not advise seeking out combat with a swarm of hornets, but this tool would be about the only effective response in addition to running for cover.  Which product you choose is up to you; my buying decision was made for me by a combination of sale, coupon, and discount that reduced the cost of this item to zero.	1
I agree with some other posts that it is a flimsy product.  However, it is effective and far superior to swatting flies.  This thing kills them instantly and doesn't leave a bloody streak of mess to clean up.  Since the wires allow air to flow through, you won't blow the target to safety with your attack, either.  I highly recommend this product.	1
I love this zapper. My brother bought a different brand with protective strands across the zapper strings because he has a grandson who chases the cat and dog with it. Mine is off limits to everybody except me, so I don't need the protective layer and it works beautifully. There was a 2" black spider in my 3 season room hanging on the screen. I touched it with my zapper and it fell down dead, curled up, like immediately. Some critters snap, others just light up and fry. Lightweight, reasonably priced, best thing I bought this summer. Plus, it's fun!	1
I think I should have haughty a cheep tennis racket instead. You have to squeeze two buttons at the same time which makes swinging awkward. I only bought it for Carpenter Bees and you need a little more reach.	-1
I don't really like smashing bugs into my walls and ceiling.  This was the obvious answer.  works perfect so far!	1
This is Redneck Entertainment at it best.  A cold beer, B-B-Q on the patio with friends and just add some flying insects to complete the evening.  This will knock yellow jackets out to the air and will give you new respect from anyone who doesn't believe your warning, "it's got a BIG PUNCH", once they try it on themselves.  Good cheap hometime fun...!	1
With some careful hunting this zapper removed a large colony of fruit flies. For very small bugs it may take a pass or two due to the spacing of the grid. Powerful enough to do the trick and a set of batteries lasts a long time.	1
If you're wanting to fry gnats, forget it. The spacing between the bars allows small insects, like gnats to pass through. However larger insects like wasps & hornets will stick to the bars and fry. I noticed that this product has a stronger current than others I've tried. Deer flies and mosquitos will get fried by this product easily enough, but if you've got smaller insects, like gnats, swarming around your head I suggest you find one of a different design. One that has smaller openings between the bars/wire mesh.	1
Works on the smallest  nats & no-see-ums that other designs don't for use by responsable people, you can get poked !	1
We live in Hawaii with 100 million mosquitos.  The Amazing Handheld Bug Zapper zaps them DEAD.  Over time we've purchased a number of them.  In most cases they've proven to be trouble free; sometimes one fails due to problems with the switches.  No matter whether they last one month of six years if you've got mosquitos they are well worth the $8.  But buy an extra one as a spare.	1
Okay, so I expected it to be cheap for this price; but, this is DANGEROUS the way it is built.  Let me explain.  Ooops, with lack of any instructions, and a virtually frozen plastic piece that looks like a battery cover, I took it apart to put the batteries in.  Putting this back together requires getting things roughly back where they were. You CANNOT just place the handle back on and screw it down.  You MUST line up the small red LED "on" indicator with the hole in the handle.  Otherwise it won't go back.  I finally started the top screw (there's a small nut on the other side you must put back in place).  The only instructions are a little label on the handle.  That is where the batteries go--if you can slide it without breaking it.  The best thing you could do is put lithium batteries in there so they last longer.  Okay, let's zap flies.  Zap is about all!!  Most just get knocked down and spin around.  You can lay this down flat and hope they jump back into it.  I saw some spark 5-7 times then finally POP!  The pop is the kill.  (One dummy flew straight into it while I was holding it.)  So, if you are indoors, count on using paper towel to gather up the injured and throw them in the trash.  My take: 1. Crap capacitors; underpowered. 2. PITA! 3. Button positions do not allow an adult hand to get a full grip and push both.	-1
After a little practice I became very adept at frying flies. They smell like burnt hair so don't inhale if one starts to smoke. You need to slowly approach a fly that is at rest and he will usually fly into the grid after the second or third try. No splatter like with an old fashioned swatter. Remember to keep the buttons pressed as a casual contact may only stun them. I finally feel like I am getting even with the evil, annoying insects!	1
This thing was only about $10 and it works in killing insects, but it's somewhat flimsy and smaller than I thought, the grid is only 5 1/2 x 7. I would spend more money and buy the larger one if I were you.	1
This is the cheapest made product I've ever owned.  To insert the 2 batteries, there is no flap that you open.  You have to take the whole handle apart with a screwdriver, then the circuit board falls out and the 2 switches fall out to the floor.  Insert the batteries, put circuit board and switches back in, insert each tiny tiny screw and the nut (3 each), hoping the screw doesn't fall out while you're holding the nut.  Are you kidding?  I'm returning this, because I don't want to go through this each time i need to change the batteries.  I just bought another one that uses 2 D size batteries, you just insert the batteries into the flip open compartment in the handle.	-1
This zapper is more of a toy for any age rather than just a boring and not always very successful bug swatter.  When we got this in we absolutely loved the whole box design they've done a great job and have brought the concept "alive" before you even start playing with it. Packaging like this in totally lost now-a-days for everyday items like a "bug swatter" and we were just taken a back all the detail and thought that went into creating this!  Now for this super cool zapper....  Where can i start?! This thing can fascinate anyone but especially boys/men: the difference between boys and men is just the price of their toys..lol..;)..NO offense to anyone. Anyhow i got away cheaply with this one i guess for once! The bigger bugs are definitely much "funner" to watch because there is more action once they hit the racket but nothing gets away from this thing.  This thing could even been used to blow off steam after a bad day just switch the light on at night and go outside and go at it like there is no tomorrow! The bugs are not going to stop coming as long as the light is on and you will definitely get a workout with all the swinging...;)  I've ordered plenty more gifts and just to have in the house for when people come over and want one because this is definitely going to be the summer accessory find for this year!  BUY ONE AND HAVE FUN!!!	1
This works pretty well for wasps but is useless for houseflies - either that or I'm just inept.  I couldn't catch the flies to buzz them.  I'm pretty sure they were mocking me as I tried.  For us, this doesn't not replace the old fashioned fly swatter - which I had to go out to the hardware store and buy. This product does seem useful for larger, stinging sorts of insects and might replace chemical bug spray products.	-1
The is one great inexpensive little "weapon" and works as advertised. Yes, its cheaply made, but it wasn't meant to be swatted against something. Yes, the 2 buttons may be annoying, but its for your own safety (speaking from experience!). I must agree with another reviewer that the wires are a little TOO far apart for smaller bugs, which will easily "slip" through the wires. May be better if it were a mesh type pattern. But all in all, for the price, you can't argue with the practicality of the product!	1
This zapper is made very well and really works as advertised, I have yet to find a bug it can't zap to death, including roaches.  The dog's nose is particularly sensitive to a zap, but he won't get close enough for you to do it again.  So far same batteries have lasted for nine months, and zapper appears strong as ever.  I would say it is well worth the money and gets there quick with Prime shipping.	1
So I bought this racket and my husband just laughed and said we got jipped when it came in the packaging which was for 3 year olds.  However, now he says honey there is a fly go get the zapper.  Yup he changed his mind completely it's amazing and just the slightest touch will kill them dead.  Keep away from children as it could hurt them.  We've had it for about a month now and the batteries are still going strong!  I highly recommend this product.  The best time to use it is when flies are pressed up against something, window, door, etc.....	1
Really, this is a very effective means of pest control. The safety feature of having two buttons pressed in order to activate it, and having them displaces so you don't accidentally turn it on is nice. When you strike, you get a big blue jolt, which from my experience, makes it fun for the kiddos. Also, i touched the racket while it was on....the current is definitely pretty strong. It won't kill a person, but it does hurt, which is a strong indication of its effectiveness against the much, much smaller insects. They don't always die first zap, but it always stuns them at the least, allowing you to toss them outside or dispose of them however you see fit. A good way to spend $10 IMO.	1
I had moved house and completely mislaid all my offensive fly attack weapons. Never needed them the first summer after I moved but for some reason, this summer, I ended up with a full scale invasion. One day I just was amazed to see about 30+ flies in my kitchen and side dinning room. I had nothing to fight them with.  I live in the boonies and most times it is quicker to get the Amazon 2 day shipping that trek into town so I ordered this item as well as the normal fly swatter.  When this arrived I played with it first and it took some getting used to. You do not smack down hard onto a surface but instead go after the flies in flight. It does work, I had several flies tumble to the ground in flames after a good hit. A couple of times I even smelt the burning and saw I had a couple stuck to the wire (yuck).  As fun as this item is, it is just too slow. After about 20 minutes I switched to the old faithful swatter.  Flies only have decent vision up to about 24" and so bringing a firm wire swatter with plastic netting down hard onto a surface will get them every time. In the same 20 minute time frame, the wire swatter decimated the fly invasion.  Over all, this item is ok. It works and it does have it's use.. but you can't beat the old fashioned fly swatter (with wire handle, not the full plastic ones).	1
Instead of passively waiting for mosquitoes to feast on you, take charge with a Charcoal Companion Zapper! You will be rewarded by a flash, a sharp crack, and occasionally a little puff of smoke. A few mosquitoes might still sneak up on you, but you will definitely have the upper hand. Try not to take out mosquito hawks, which look like mosquitoes but are much larger.  They are actually on you side, as they eat mosquitoes!	1
This thing is great! Those who say it breaks to easily should realize that as much like a badminton racket as it may look, it IS NOT for swatting shuttle cocks! One need merely see a fly, moth or other flying insect, approach the little bugger, depress the conveniently situated power buttons on the handle a  do a "slow-mo" badminton maneuver until the bug as been ever so gently touched by the power grid and WHAM! The flying thing lights up and dies instantly! Furthermore, it sticks to the grid just enough so it doesn't fall to the floor so that you can then walk the racket to the nearest toilet, turn it bug-side down, give the racket a gentle rap and the insect falls into the water awaiting it's departing flush.  No kidding. I like this thing so much I picked up a second one today. If you'r bothered by flying insects buy one of these. You'll wish you had a few more bugs after the first day of enjoyable hunting.  (UPDATE: A week after getting this swatter the battery door broke off. A piece of scotch tape fixed that. No big deal.)	1
After an outbreak of pantry moths I was ready to scream.  I tried lots of solutions but none as satisfying as this gadget.  The little devils are hard to kill.  One will all of a sudden appear, fluttering across the room, and if you're not quick, it will disappear again just as fast.  Sometimes you can clap your hands over it to kill it and I've even used a butterfly net, but you can't swat them like you would a fly because when they land they're pretty much invisible.  You have to get them in the air.  I was willing to try any harebrained thing--which I thought this was--but voila!  It zaps the little suckers very effectively.  Since you have to grab it fast and have it right way up in order to depress both the buttons to activate it, I put a sign on the 'up' side since it is otherwise not easy to tell.  Once in hand of course, it can be used repeatedly and quickly and is great when sitting out on the deck.  It has made summer evenings much more pleasant.  I really don't want a big zapping machine making noise so this really fills the bill for me.  I've used it a lot in the last year but haven't had to change the batteries yet.  When my adult daughter was sitting on the deck one night and came in looking for the bug spray, I gave her this gadget.  She was super impressed and bought one herself.  If you hit a damp object or a big bug, there is a rather loud spark and sizzle so you have to be prepared to deal with that, but it absolutely works.	1
I bought this cause my previous one from Home Goods had broke. Comparing the Amazon one to the Home Goods one, Home Goods one is better hands down. I would of bought this again from Home Goods, but I don't have an Home Goods where I live and I was unable to find it anywhere online.  Comparison between Amazon & Home Goods: -Amazon one measures about 6" wide x 8" height. The Home Goods one was at least 1 inch bigger all around. -Home Goods one had a good feel to it and fit nicely in the hand mainly because the handle thickness and size was almost the same as a tennis racket. The Amazon one is much smaller and squared. -Amazon one has 2 buttons to turn it on where they both must be held to turn on. I know its a safety feature but the Home Goods one had a seperate switch on the bottom and a single button to turn on. Once your done, you can just switch it off  Pros of Amazon one: -Lightweight and does what it says  Cons: -Small handle -Small face  Concludion: -If you can get your hands on the Home Goods one, purchase that one. Its about $12 or $15. If you cant find it, then take this one cause it will get the job done.	1
I like these a lot more that most of the other "swatters"! The grid on most of the others have a divider in them which requires that the bug you are trying to zap get in between them. And the big round handle on most of the others makes it almost impossible to hold it flat to the wall. I use mine to also zap spiders. Last time I checked, spiders don't really fly so you have to get the spider to crawl onto the grid. With the other ones even if you get it to crawl onto the grid it would also have to crawl in between the grids to be zapped. Another plus with this model is that they only use AA batteries and weigh a lot less than the ones that use C or D batteries.	1
this product works well, even though cheaply built.  The insects explode with a pleasant 'bang' and it is so satisfying that one soon goes looking for more to kill..  The battery cover is cheap and may get loose. I placed some duct tape over that to hold it in place.  In terms of design I would prefer just a single switch (no doubt lawyers made them use two - you know, for safety) but one does get used to holding both to switch it on. One can also easily open the unit up and solder one switch closed.  After being given one and find one at a yard sale I bought 6 more!	1
We found the bug zapper first in Canada, but had trouble finding them in local stores. So we were thrilled to find these available through Amazon. My husband delights to wage war against the black flies coming over from the stables next door. You know you scored when you see the spark! Don't buy just one. These make wonderful (dare I say unique?) hostess gifts for anyone who might be pestered with flying pests.	1
Zap, sizzle, fry, fly Go up in a plume of smoke Paddle bids you 'Die!'	1
cheaply made piece of junk. worked one week. now it's over. even while it worked it wasn't good. never killed the fly, just tortured 'em. i don't like flies, but i'd rather kill 'em in one whack. this thing slowly cooked 'em.	-1
You will discover a part of you you never wanted to know.  The sheer, unmitigated pleasure of frying something living.  The fact that it's a gnat that just loves flying around your nose does not alleviate the moral issues involved.  And this from a person who has caught more than a dozen stink bugs in the house, and gently relocated them outside (and this even before finding out there is a reason for their name).  Not to mention ladybirds and spiders.  The only thing that compares in pleasure is using my handvac to exterminate fruit flies in the summer.  But playing electric racket might be even more fun.  So, yes, it WORKS!  And yes, there is a sparkle when you are electrocuting them.  The large surface increases success, though gnats are cheeky buggers.  Have not used it long to see how much it lasts, but I would consider a replacement if it broke down.	1
We have had an infestation of pantry moths and regular flyswatters just weren't cutting it.  We got one of these and now our pantry moths are meeting their deaths on a daily basis.  This bug zapper has definite advantages over a flyswatter.  You can zap the bugs out of the air; you don't have to wait until they land.  It should be noted though, if they do land, you can't smash the bugs like with a flyswatter.  You have to place the zapper over the bug and move the edge up to the bug until they fly into the zapper.  The bug dies on the zapper and you don't have a nasty bug smear on the wall to clean up! The Zapper also requires a two button press so it can't really go off accidentally (good if you have curious children.)  These work great against the aforementioned moths as well as flies.  My husband also used it to kill a cricket that was invading our living room, but I admit I was too squeamish to watch that particular execution.  This is a great bug killer.  The only reason I left off a star is because this is our second Zapper - the first just died after about six months.  So I don't think they are very durable, and for that, I left off a star.  However, for the price, I don't mind replacing this twice a year, and I will continue to do so until every bug is gone!	1
I bought one of these on a lark about five or six years ago at a pool and spa place.  Only recently one of the switches became intermittent so I decided to replace it after a LOT of use.  Reading some of the one and two star reviews I decided the quality must have gone down so I ordered three to make sure I got a good one.  They all work fine.  The only thing I noticed is the three screws in the handles were kind of loose on every one.  This could be due to the plastic compressing after assembly.  If my memory isn't failing, I think I remember having to resolder a wire on that old one after very little use so it wasn't perfect.  One of the most common complaints I've seen is this racket is cheap.  C'mon folks, what do you expect for the price?  You couldn't take your sweetie to Burger King for that amount without a coupon.  The one thing I really like about this zapper is the wires are all on one plane.  That means you can zap a bug sitting in any expose position.  Those double layered models can't do that.  They're only good for those flying types - and small ones at that.  The Charcoal Companion wire arrangement allows doing battle with any size bug you have the nerve to attack.  Those double layer jobs require the bug to pass through one side to get zapped in the middle.  If you have one of those and see a truly awesome insect, run!  A word of caution:  Don't touch the grid when it's acitivated.  If you do, it will let you know you did a boo-boo you won't forget.  One last thing.  This instrument is dynamite for wasps.  No joke!	1
I've been using several of this type of bug zapper around the house for years, and never had one break. However, I have had them break when I've let house guests try them out. It's because the house guests didn't understand what it was that they were using.  One of them broke apart into pieces (akin to other reviewers' comments that they are poorly made). When I questioned my house guest as to how he was using it - I had to inform him "It's not a fly swatter! You don't have to smash the bug, just tap it."  When the "on" button broke (re: other reviewers' comments) on another unit - it was because a house guest was trying to zap a bug on the other side of a window screen (I.E. no electrical contact). She subconsciously kept pushing the button harder and harder trying to create more charge to zap the bug.  I prefer this single plane type of swatter. The multi-planar grid types are designed to reduce the liklihood of accidentally zapping its user; but it also reduces the chances of zapping the intended target.  Another reviewer critiqued that with larger insects such as flies, it doesn't kill them - it only stuns them. Well, yes - that's right. But guess what? While the fly is laying stunned on its back - you grab a tissue, pick it up and toss it down the toilet!  If you don't have a need (I.E young children) for the dual button design of this swatter, you can epoxy the lower of the two buttons permanently on. This will make the swatter easier to use.	1
I've now tried three different version of the zappers.  This is the only one without the "guard" screens that keep you from accidentally touching the charged screen (wires, in this case).  Here's what I didn't like about the design and performance of this zapper:  1.  Since there are no guard screens, this zapper has two buttons that must be depressed simultaneously to activate.  The position of the buttons means that your hand has to be at the very end of the handle, so far down that my pinky wasn't part of the grip.  Still works OK, just feels unnatural.  2.  The lack of the guard screens means that flies are less likely to get trapped in the layers of screen.  That's a bit cleaner: you don't have to tap or brush the flies out.  But it also means they are less likely to get a good zap.  My experience is that flies are often just stunned and will recover.  The designs I've used that have guard screens will trap the flies and allow for a longer, more satisfying (smoke-inducing) zap.  Getting them out of the multiple layers of screen is not difficult and worth the effort if it helps ensure they're dead.  3.  Smaller screen compared to others I've used. (Why don't they make these with a square shape so you can hold it flat against the surface the fly is on and then swat at it laterally?)  4.  This particular model broke (quit generating a charge) after just a couple weeks use.  All these zappers are cheaply made (brittle plastic, etc.) and this model wasn't any better or worse in that sense.	-1
I've had one of these for many years and just bought a couple more, one for a spare and one for my Mom, who taught me to be bug phobic.  She was here visiting and a wasp was upstairs and she was freaking and I came to her rescue with my trusty 'executioner' and she was so impressed she just had to have one, too.  What I like about it is that it has a much larger footprint than a fly swatter so it's easier for an old fart like me to hit the target AND it kills quickly and without leaving a squished bug body on your wall or counter. I really like the advantage it gives me against bugs that can fight back, like wasps.  My rule for bugs is simple...if you want to live, stay outside. The only exception to this rule regards carpenter bees. If they want to live they can go drill holes in someone else's deck/house/porch. Carpenter bee badminton is a permissible activity on my deck.	1
I got by husband one of these for Christmas as a gag gift.  A few days later he used it to zap a huge spider and the sparks were cool but I think it was the sizzling sound that really amused him.  He grinned like a devilish 10 year old and proclaimed that this was the neatest gift that he had ever received. (Isn't it always that way? Spend hundreds of dollars on thoughtfully planned gifts and it's the $10.00 toy that steals the show...)  I also got one for my mom, who rarely likes anything I get her and she told me right off that she didn't like it.  She likes it now, after using it to kill a scary wasp.  Also got one for an elderly family friend who is only partially ambulatory.  My mom said that he, "Won't be able to use that," but his wife reports that he keeps it beside his recliner and takes flies out in mid-air. (Another 10 year old...)  You do need to press both buttons at the same time in order for it to work, which is a safety precaution.  I wouldn't get it for real 10 year olds but do highly recommend it for second-time-around 10 year olds.	1
Yes, its plastic and parts are cheap, but its only 10 bucks!.. I wish someone would make a bulletproof one for around 30. Most of the more expensive ones I've seen are merely overpriced and don't work as good.  Nevertheless, this looks cheaper than those other types with the protective grids "that actually work against you" by pushing the bugs away rather than electrocuting them.  This "single grid" system works perfect. Each wire is of opposite polarity.. one negative, one positive and so on. So there is nothing to block the bug from getting zapped.  Keep in mine "very" small knats may sneak through the grids from time to time, but normal size bugs like mosquitos and flies are dead.  I used to have tons of spiders that liked to lower themselves out of the trees at night and end up on your face or head as you walked by in the dark around my pool. I started taking a small flashlight and purposely going on spider hunts at night, it didn't take long at all to get them all. Now a couple of years later, I still seldom find one!.. I think I zapped all the pregnant ones and broke the chain of generations.  I warn you to not touch the grids even after you release the button for at least 30 seconds. A tiny capacity drains the energy from the grid when the button is released but it takes time.. if it did it too quickly, the battery would drain too quickly as you held the button down.  My daughter "playing around" touched my arm with mine and it felt like a 400 lb wrestler jerked my arm as hard as he could... yes it was sore!... it affected every muscle in my arm.. so don't be dumb and play with it.. its not a toy, but rather a bug killing machine!  I tested the voltage with my voltmeter and it went off the scale.... its somewhere around 1500 volts "but very little amperage".  I recommend NiMh rechargable batteries as they have the ability to dish out high current until drained whereas Alkaline only do good when fully charged, then performance after that is minimal for high current devices.  Lithium ion would be the best, but good luck finding them in D cell.  Alkaline is ok as long as you give it a rest between your bug safaris!  All in all, 10.00 doesn't buy much these days... that makes this racket well worth the money and an impressive gift for the money by any means!	1
I hate to think of myself as having fun at some other creature's expense but - BWAHAHAHA, bite THIS, you bloodsucking fiends!!  I first saw this being used on a vacation to St. John.  The employees in the cantina each had one, and were waving them around slowly in front of their faces, almost in a hypnotic way.  Apparently that is the best way to get mosquitoes, according to these folks (who should be VERY familiar with mosquitoes and their ways!)  If you try to swat at them too fast you will just blow them away, but if you move the paddle around slowly they will just fly right into it and go sizzle sizzle sizzle ...!  ;^)  Heed what everyone says though: don't hit yourself with it while the buttons are pressed, and don't let kids "play" with it.  It can give you a nasty burn.	1
**Update October 2016**  I've had this racket for 8 years and it's still functioning as it should.  I change the batteries every 1-2 years, and I rate this as one of my best purchases ever.  My husband likes it too because with this racket I can tackle the spiders and insects in our house on my own.  Very happy, especially considering the inexpensive price.  **Original review** I've used this racket on gnats, mosquitoes, flies, moths, spiders, and wasps/yellow jackets.  I love this racket, it's been great because even for spiders that aren't moving much, I'm too squeamish to kill them with a paper towel.  And for flying insects that are on the move, this racket is really great.  The only negative I've noticed is that when I'm wildly swinging this zapper around to see how many gnats I can kill, the battery cover slides a little.  Not a big deal to me.  If I'm not swinging it wildly, the battery cover doesn't budge.  I picked this bug zapper over the other oh-so-similar racket zappers available because this one only has horizontal zapper wires in the racket area..... no protective mesh that might interfere with eliminating pesky bugs.  **Update** August 2009: I've owned this racket for over 18 months now with frequent use, and someone requested a specific update about a couple of common problems with this racket, so here it is!  Regarding having to press on two buttons to use this racket, I'm glad of this feature because it reduces the likelihood of it bumping up against something in storage and accidentally being turned on.  The buttons are staggered on each side of the handle so that my thumb is on the upper button, and my index finger is on the lower button.  I have to take 1/2 a second to make sure my fingers are in the right place and the little LED light is on and working, but it doesn't bother me.  The buttons are a safety feature and I'm willing to work with them.  Regarding the battery cover, it sometimes slides about 1/2", but it has never slid off completely so I don't worry about it.  I'm STILL on the original set of batteries this zapper came with.  :)  If this racket zapper ever stops working perfectly, I'll update, but so far it really has exceeded expectations.	1
This is very fun to use in a ghoulish goth sort of way. But once you have used it you will never be without it. We bought our first bug zapper in 2004. It still works exactly like new. We change the batteries once a year, an easy task. We have purchased a zillion of these as gifts for friends and family. Here is how they work. First you have to have flies, mosquitos, or other flying insect pest. When you see the pest, act like this is a tennis racket and swing in the area of the pest while pushing the little on button. If your accuracy is even 50% the bug will be zapped on contact and fall straight to the floor. This is where our cat runs to gobble up the BBQ bug. We hate flies, live in a high bug area, and don't want the sickness you can get from them boldly landing on your sandwich while your are bringing it up to your mouth. UGH. No smashing the bug into the wall like a swatter does.  Do not touch the wires while it is on. You will get zapped and it is not refreshing.	1
I don't own these but saw them at a flea market. No question in my mind why they were up for sale (but should have gone in the trash IMO!) My friend discovered -- the hard way! -- that these deliver a VERY unpleasant shock if touched to human skin! Mind you, this friend is a large manly guy, not easily affected, yet he howled and dropped it! So you can imagine the jolt of voltage that must have been involved here! I would not want my children in the same room with these devices, nor my father with his pacemaker, or even my pets to inadvertantly come in contact with the live zapper screen. What were they thinking!?!?!?	-1
I enjoyed this tool until now. The end of the grip broke-off. I didn't abuse it, just poor workmanship. Don't buy the OXO Good Grips Gel-e Gardening Trowel 16075	-1
Well, it's a bit of a pain to get the fittings installed.  Cheap plastic locking rings, one broke immediately.  I'm not impressed.  save your money and skip this.	-1
If you get any wind on your pool, it will blow it over to the sides of the pool and waste water as the fountain sprays out over the sides.  The set up is pretty cheesy with a clear soft vinyl tube that runs from pool outtake to the fountain and is weighted to the bottom of the pool with a small weight you ziptie on.  I didn't like all the tubing in the pool where we swim for one and if it gets a kink in it, of course the fountain stops and you need to wrangle this long clear tube of water pressure to get it going again.  After leaving in pool for merely a couple weeks, the blue flower part was faded and had a water line mark around the sides where it sits on the water.  Easy to get tangled in as well when kids are playing. I will say when it was working properly, the fountain of water it makes is pretty.  But I wish I had that $30 back.	-1
Worked for 2 days, then it stopped.  Wasn't worth sending back	-1
Didn't fit to my pool . I had to return it.	-1
This thing is a cheap piece of junk, don't waste your money on it.  I was out on vacation and by the time I set it up and found out it was not what I expected it to be I was one day beyond the return window...	-1
looked great for about 10 minutes. Then you sit back and realize it's pretty cheap and flimsy. The weight holds it for the most part in place but once your sweeper starts moving around forget it. Do yourself a favor, buy some hose, jam it in the output of one of your return valves, run it up to your pergola or roof, connect a 12foot 1/2" pvc with 1/4" holes every 4 feet, and watch that thing cascade down to your pool instead of buying this. What a run on sentence!!!!	-1
There is alot written about this grill's problem with regulator flow etc.  I have been to Weber's site, read through the reviews of the problem, and can't get the grill above 200F because I use a regular size home propane tank.  the woman on the phone from weber was nice, and walked me through the startup steps, but still a pathetic little flame was all we got.  She suggested a new regulator, but since I've already replaced it once, I think I'll just junk this grill.  I hear if you use the little disposables that this problem doesn't exist, but that isn't exactly sustainable, is it?  there has to be a better way to engineer this grill.  in the meantime, find another one if you intend to use a full size home tank.	-1
if you ever have to call Weber customer service you are in trouble. They employ the nicest sounding, most polite people on the face of the earth but they are clueless.  They are worse than the the strictest script reading overseas CSR's because they are convinced that you are stupid and the key to your intellectual salvation lies on the scripted response sheet they have in front of them.  If you have mechanical or engineering experience that indicates what they are telling you might be wrong, well you are just a silly man!!	-1
Bought this grill (from another on-line seller) early in the summer. It fails every time we use it. It is cumbersome, not easily portable. It goes out in the slighest breeze. Can't imagine using it on a windy beach.  Sometimes it goes out for no apparent reason. The hose connecting the grill to a regular propane tank was defective and had to be replaced. Sometimes the grill will not heat above 200 degrees. When the flame fails, a long wait is required before re-lighting. The small propane cylinder is inadequate for entertaining more than a few, but that doesn't matter, because there are so many other defects, you may never run out of fuel in the first place.  The little rolling cart is flimsy. There is no place to put the larger conventional propane tank.  The product may be cute, but it is the perfect way to spoil a party.  A complete dud. In our experence three sticks and a match  work just as well. Not what you might expect from Weber.	-1
Tongs have no teeth to grab the food. If your food has any suace like BBQ sauce often used when grilling it is very difficult to grab it. If you can grab it then the food will then slide right out unless you really grab it hard. Finally you will probably squeeze the juice right out of it. The spatula might be worth the $10 alone and then trash the tongs.	-1
COVER DID NOT FIT MY SUMMIT GOLD GAS GRILL. HAD TO RETURN	-1
Sadly, I had to order this twice.  My first order of three boxes arrived with product spilled EVERYWHERE.... all over my deck, my kitchen floor, all over the inside of the shipping box ... and at least two of the boxes of product were only half full.  I was promptly sent another order at no charge, and it was even sent overnight so I could do the composting project that I had planned for yesterday.  But that one arrived pretty much the same way.  The issue is that the box it's packed in is not glued properly to ensure that the product doesn't spill out.  The corners are wide open, and seams are loose.  The manufacturer needs to either shrink wrap the box on the outside, or put the product in a sealed wax paper or plastic bag inside the box.  I have used this product in the past, and it's nice to have when you want to start a new compost pile and kick-start it, so that you get a faster batch of usable compost.  However, I must admit that I don't love the product quite enough to get past the issue of major spillage.  I paid for three boxes, and of the six I got there was probably a total of two full boxes (4 lbs) total product.  I ended up taking a 5 gallon paint mixing container and emptying each box into it.  I couldn't even do that without it spilling everywhere through the box's seams.  I had to hold each box over the container, and carefully open the box from the bottom (that's where all the open seams and corners were).  Sadly, unless the manufacturer fixes this problem, I won't be ordering this item again.  It's too bad, because it could potentially be a hit.  But it literally took me two hours to clean the mess that was everywhere.  I'm sure there is still some product under my stove and refrigerator.  Needless to say, that took so much of my time yesterday that I still haven't even started my planned compost pile project.  EDIT:  A month later... yesterday I noticed that my compost is not decomposing any faster than it usually does without this stuff.  A much better option would be to buy yourself a bunch of red wigglers.  They would break it down for you.	-1
eh, not sure it worked.  I bought this early-on during my composting cycle before I read articles and books on how to properly compost.  I never achieved a high temperature until I read, "Let it Rot" by Stu Campbell.  It is a short-read and packed full of good information, I highly recommend.  At any rate, if you want your compost to heat up, there's really only 3 things you need to know.  Moisture, Oxygen and Nitrogen.  Buying a box of Alfalfa Meal will go a lot further in terms of biological activity and breakdown opposed to this.  Most things you will find in your backyard are going to be higher in carbon than nitrogen (except grass clippings), so if you are low on grass (ie trying to compost fallen leaves in autumn), go get some alfalfa meal and your pile will heat up!	-1
The product arrived with a lot of material missing	-1
Could not tell that it helped accelerate the process at all	-1
Everything, your food scraps, your leaves, your newspaper, your skin, your table - EVERYTHING is covered in bacteria, the same bacteria you need to make compost.  Rather than buying a box of bacteria, fill a box with food scraps and other items that are covered in bacteria. It will be just as effective and far less expensive.	-1
I thought at first it was going to work, I mixed the product with some leaves and grass kept moist after a few days there was a little heat generated but then nothing!  Thank you	-1
I added it to my compost pile, but didn't really see any noticible results a week or two after adding it.	-1
I thought it would work a little faster. I followed the directions, but it didn't speed the decomposition up any faster than Mother Nature	-1
Added this to compost pile as it is a new pile. It is divided into two sides and I added it to one side. Maybe it did something but I couldn't tell.	-1
Didn't notice any difference in rate of composting.	-1
There is no excuse to having a box that leaks all over the place. I could not even use this stuff because it leaked all over the inside of my Amazon box. I did not bother from that point on. Be forewarned.	-1
The price seemed right, but this two pound box cost more to pack and ship. When it arrived in a huge shipping box, the contents of the products spilled out. What was a 2 pound product was torn formed into just 1pound of product. Do not buy this stuff in a box without any internal wrapping. Buy something in a bag so it cannot spill. I was going to snd it back, but I decided just to learn a lesson and pass it on. Be forewarned.	-1
So much of the product spilled out into the packing box I did not have enough to do what I ordered it for. The awful scent of the compost could be smelled in my house. Very poor packaging	-1
a good amount of the product was lost and in the shipping container due to not being properly packed into the box it comes in. It is granules and it comes out the bottom seam of the box... and need to be enclosed in plastic or something to keep it in. Then on top of that they give entirely different instructions for doing a compost. One example they say keep in a shaded area where my compost holder said to make sure that the area I keep my compost pile in is getting some sun. Anyways... I don't think you even need this product as just making sure to put some soil onto the pile now and they or just making sure to turn the pile will do the same job... in short... big waste of money.	-1
I got this for my composts and composting toilet.  However, since adding the product, I have seen no appreciable difference to the piles.  They are still cooking at the same slow rate as before.  I see no reason to waste my money if it's not going to change anything.	-1
While I did not purchase this saw on Amazon. Perhaps best for amazon because I received it as a Birthday gift . Well it lasted all of 20 minutes. I have many years experience with chain saws and had to finally go electric because I am physically restricted as to what I feel safe doing. Long and short after 20 minutes of cutting maple limbs from trees that had been felled. The oiler and everything was working fine and the chain had been re-tensioned. I started the saw a began to make a cut through a four inch limb and the saw stopped cutting and started smoking profusely. I unplugged the saw and it continued to smoulder. The saw is dead after 20 minutes into a two year warranty. Brought it back to Lowes and because I didn't have a receipt and even though the date stamp clearly showed it to be less than a year old they refused to take the saw back. My son purchased it at Lowes.  I then looked at the reviews on the saw itself and found that there are a plethora of negative feedback regarding the saw and Remington customer service	-1
Piece of crap. Bought from Lowe's. Once the chain needs adjusting, after one use of approximately 8 hours intermittently, the chain loosened. Tried taking it apart and correcting the problem to no avail. Do not buy.	-1
Honestly, I have never used it.  I ordered it, and when it came, just the weight of it was more than I could handle.  I'm sure some strong person could handle it just fine, but I went back to my chain saw.	-1
When I bought this chainsaw 5+ years ago it was a good deal in relation to what else was available, but this is no longer the case. There are much better choices at the same price in electric chainsaws with tool-less chain tensioning, sprocket tip bars and effective automatic oilers. The chain oiler on this chainsaw is simply awful, and stopped working properly after a couple of years of very light use. After reading the fine print in the manual I discovered that you cannot use normal tacky chain oil in the oiler, because it will gum it up and must instead use regular motor oil. Motor oil will not stay on the chain and lubricate it properly, and instead gets flung all over the place including the operator. Also, the oiling system leaks badly when the saw is not in use, and the manual instructs you to "empty the oil tank after every use to prevent seepage." Incredible ! During heavy use the chain gets very hot, expanding to the point that it constantly falls off the bar. The chain tension has to be constantly adjusted by loosening two hex nuts with a wrench, turning a small wing nut and then re-tightening the two nuts. I've replaced the chain twice and the bar once. I completely dismantled and re-assembled the saw in a vain attempt to revive the oiler. This year I'd had enough and bought two new 14" and 18" electric chainsaws with automatic oilers that work properly with tacky chain oil, have super easy tooless chain tensioning and sprocket tip bars to reduce chain and bar wear and maintain chain tension better.	-1
I've had this saw for a few years and have used it a several times a year and it worked pretty well. However, when I used it this year to cut some dead wood it started to give off smoke and a bad electrical odor.  After this happened some power was lost and it got really hot.  I let it cool down and it still runs at half power.  The motor must be shot.  I'm going to buy a better quality saw from now on.	-1
These Shears broke in two pieces after about 10 minutes of use.  The blade only goes up apprx. 1/4 inch into the plastic and unless you are using this for "dead-heading" small blossoms I would not recommend this. I am a great big fan of Fiskars and almost all my tools for gardening are theirs, but they blew it on this one. I have since ordered "Bonsai Shears" which are from Japan they last for years, never get dull and will cut with ease almost everything up to 1/4" and cost less than #9638 floral shears.	-1
cheap product.  will use it until it breaks.  wouldn't buy again.	-1
Fiskars could have done a lot better with these shears!  They pinch your hands and don't cut worth a hoot!	-1
It was working good like Fiskars products usually do, and then the right blade broke where the connecting post fits in.  It did this just trimming the edge of my grass where my lawnmower misses.  My conclusion is that this should not have happened except for a manufacting defect in the metal or how it was assembled.  A previous review states theirs has been working great for over 3 years.  Well, sorry to mess up this products 5 star rating; but the truth is Fiskars needs better quality control for this product.	-1
I bought my first Mosquito Magnet several years ago. They no longer sell or service that model called the industrial model. It worked reasonably well but had start up problems. I sent it back for power head repairs three times. Last year I purchased a Liberty model and had to also send it back twice within a year for repair. It has stopped working again and it is no longer under warranty. The long and short of it is these things only work for about a year. They do catch mosquitoes but have a design flaw. They flat out do not last. I live in the Florida Keys and if they worked and held up I would have them all over my property. However, I would have to have a full time repairperson on the payroll.	-1
One of the costliest mistakes I ever made was purchasing this device (actually two of them!) to control mosquitoes in the yard.  Yes, it caught mosquitoes, but it did not eliminate the problem; the yard was still a mosquito zone despite two operating machines.  The problem was that while the machine does catch mosquitoes, it does not catch enough of them to make a serious dent in the overall population.  It was not until I sprayed the yard with Cutter Bug-Free Backyard&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Cutter-Bug-Free-Backyard-32-oz-Ready-to-Spray-Hose-End-Insect-Repellent-Concentrate-HG-61067/dp/B000PGE032/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Cutter Bug Free Backyard 32 oz Ready-to-Spray Hose End Insect Repellent Concentrate HG-61067</a>, that I finally got rid of the mosquitoes.  I did not like this product for many reasons:  it had a high initial cost, it required replacing the Octenol attractant (more $$), and the propane tank needed refilling about every 3-4 weeks (more $$).  In addition, it needs an electrical cord plug-in nearby, and one has to replace the mosquito catch nets (more $$).  Basically, it costs too much to operate, takes too much on-going maintenence time and effort, and most importantly, it did not eliminate the pesky mosquitoes!  So now I have two of these things taking up space in my shed.  I will not sell the devices because they simply do not work to control mosquitoes.  They will be future landfill items.  Save your hard-earned dollars and avoid this product and its clones.  Use the Cutter Bug-Free Backyard spray instead.  konedog	-1
This product is a waste of money.  It will only last for one season and its' effetiveness was minimal.  Two other folks on the street bought one as well and had the same experience.  After mine stopped working (the first time), customer service was marginal at best.  I live in the south and I got a little desperate to solve the misquito problem.  Save your money and buy more cans of bugs spray.	-1
Expensive hunk of junk.  Orig. purchase date Nov. 2006, after the first one we'd bought quit working just a little after the warranty period ended.  The 'head' on this Defender has been repaired three times and replaced twice.  If you get a replacement head from them, there is no additional warranty past your original purchase date (even though they sent you a new one!).  Save your money for something else.  Ours is dead again.  We purchased an inexpensive replacement plan through Amazon, but we're done with the Defender-we're throwing it away.	-1
Besides the cost of propane and attractant cartridges you have to buy about every 21 days, you need to figure in the cost of using 1 of the CO2 Quick-clean cartridges at each tank refill, at a cost of about $4 each. Depending on what you pay for the propane, attractant and CO2 cartridges, it sums up to a cost of $20 around or more at each tank refill. Since you have to refill the propane tank, replace the attractant and use the Quick-clean every 21 days, this adds up to an operating cost of over $400 per year! I'm posting this because it is something you may need to budget for and should seriously consider before buying.	-1
It worked great for one season but when I went to start it up for this season it wouldn't start. I did everything the manual and website said to do when I put it away last fall and did everything the manual and website said to start it up this spring, including wasting three of the "clean out" cartridges and it still doesn't work. Plan on buying a new one every year if this is the one you choose.  Their tech support does not answer emails and the wait for them to answer the phone is nearly endless.  Bottom line: avoid this product.	-1
These units are a joke! A bad joke! I have spent about $30 per mosquito trapped (actually more).  When the starter button came out, they offered to let me increase my investment to fix it.  Run away and talk to a pest control firm.  This was a huge mistake.  I live in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Basically the unit doesn't catch anything and it cost a tank of propane and a strip of octenol every month.  Do the math.  This is a scam.	-1
They worked good when they were new but after two years the blades got dull and would not cut the grass. The blades don't stay sharp for a lifetime as the guarantee claims. I will not buy these grass shears again.	-1
Don't waste your money on this product.  There is either a design problem, or manufacturing issue, that causes the lock button to slide down during use.  The result is that the shears lock up frequently while being used.  You're forever then having to unlock the shears.  Or worse, when using the shears,  you must keep a finger on the lock button to insure it does not slide into the lock position ... which is very difficult and cumbersome.  I wound up trashing my shears after only two months of use.	-1
I bought these last fall thinking they'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way. I don't remember using them at all last year; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together.  They stay open about an inch and a half!  There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk. Too bad, the other Fiskar products we have are great. They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board.	-1
After a week of use, it is licking all over. Very low quality.	-1
I've had curly hoses in the past and this one is much more stiff than others.  Connectors are solid, the hose portion just kinks too much and isn't nearly as automatic curling up as those I've had in the past	-1
Couldn't use it. Too much tension in the coils pulled my movable sprinkler out of the ground.	-1
This is ok if you don't mind a thin/slow stream. You will NOT be able to attain high water pressure with this... so it might be ok for watering a garden or your lawn but if you want high pressure by a regular hose.	-1
You get what you pay for.  I like spring hoses - since those "expandable" ones always seem to explode at some point, and I have another that I paid almost $50 for.  Thought, "Well, this is a secondary hose so don't really need to spend that much."  For the marginal additional cost, I should have just sucked it up.  The name should be a big clue..."Plastair"...this hose is very cheap plastic.  Not vinyl or similar.  And the attachments are seriously the cheapest light-weight metal (aluminum, maybe), not even the semi cheap "brass" of other hoses.  Leaks around both ends of the fittings.  If you intend to use this more than a few times for a short period, just spend the extra money for the higher quality version.	-1
I returned this as I couldn't get it to extend 25-feet, unfortunately not even close ;-(	-1
It's nowhere near 50ft maybe 25 or 30 but not worth the time to send it back. Don't waste your money	-1
Defective Crap.  Leaks at the faucet coupler right out of the box.  Clearly cheap materials.  Clearly shoddy construction.  If you're looking for something to do, by all means buy one of these and enjoy the time spent installing, fidgeting, adjusting and ultimately returning this Made in China crap.  But, if you've already got a life, don't make my mistake - do yourself a favor and spend the extra $10 on a quality hose.	-1
DON'T waste your money on this hose!!!  The very light weight metal fittings are just crimped on to the hose and just drop off.  Never even used it, just threw it in the trash. CRAP Total waste!!!!	-1
Coiled only measures about 16", didn't extend more than 7 feet. Could have bought for a few more dollars a true 25' coiled hose.	-1
crap - absolute crap  get the waterright one instead.  The tinfoil  fittings on this came off when I tried to attach the hose.  My waterright hose that I have had for three years got run over by a lawnmower and I clicked on the wrong thing.  I am going to see if I can attach those fittings to this hose, but it will be a to see if I can project- I already bought a real hose.	-1
Only got on season out of it and the fittings cracked on one end.	-1
I like the lead proof aspect but 2 reasons this gets low marks  - with the coiled feature, 50 ft gets you nowhere near where you expect because the hose doesn't stretch without kinking and shutting off water supply.  - the gasket doesn't do its job and this leaks heavily at the faucet.  it failed to impress me.	-1
BUY APEX	-1
It kinks too easily and the flow is very weak, also doesn't stretch far enough. .  I am very disappointed	-1
Received a clear blue plastic hose that blew out both ends when connected. Not a green Plasticair as described in the offer. Even small hose clamps did not help. Seeking a refund. Avoid this product.	-1
Ok the pro:  it coils..  Con: Kinks, does not stretch out to full length of course, kinks, kind of bulky compared to the new "expandable" hoses, kinks..  Overall, these hoses while great in concept tend to be a real PITA to use in the real world.. (other than maybe a short shot to a flower pot).. Did I mention that they kink?	-1
Hard plastic!..you get what you pay for! I didn't even take it out of the packaging. Other hoses are WAY more flexible.  I have Amazon Prime, so there was no problem with the shipping speed.	-1
All the bad reviews are correct.  The hose is too light and too springy.  It kinks very easily, and requires a lot of work to keep it from getting hung up on it's own coils.  I bought this hose less than 2 years ago.  It's gotten only very light use, and only in the summer.  However, it's sprung a major leak in the middle of it's length, and is now entirely unusable.  I would only consider this hose if one needed something disposable, for very light duty, and probably only in a 25' or shorter length, so that there's less hassle with kinking.	-1
A couple years ago, we needed a new hose and my wife wanted a reel to go with It. I didn't want the reel. We compromised and got this 50-foot Spring Hose at our local home warehouse store.  This garden hose has not been a good buy and I would hesitate to recommend it except for special circumstances. First of all, It looks like a good idea, but it's very hard to use. It might be 50 foot, but we have difficulty stretching it out more than 25 feet from the spout. If we attach a sprinkler to it, the sprinkler gradually creeps back toward the spout because of the coils. Plus, the coils are very easy to get all entangled and hard to untangle. It's a very awkward apparatus and hard to manage anywhere in the yard.  One time I turned the water off at the hose nozzle. That was a mistake. Our water pressure then produced an aneurism in the hose and it finally popped. Time for a hose repair kit. Then my wife did the same thing and it responded in the same manner elsewhere on the hose. This time our neighbor had to come over and turn it off because we were not home. Now it's starting to crack in a third place. I'll now be glad to get rid of it. Think twice before purchasing this hose.  Gary Peterson	-1

I'm trying to move fox out of my neighbor so my chickens can be free range.  I've manage to catch three but a lot of times the trap doesn't go off or it doesn't lock so the animals can push out the door. I think I now have it working.  Hopefully my chicken can come out of the coop in a couple more weeks.  Update next day: I have video of this large raccoon enter the trap three times before it went off.  Then he tore the door off. Changed to a 1.	-1
TOO SMALL FOR COYOTES	-1
I have only caught two foxes in it so far most of the time I find it sprung with nothing in it . I believe it is not long enough and the larger foxes tails are holding the door open so they may escape.	-1
I gave it 2 starts cause the company was great in replacing one trap.. By the time I got it the other trap also failed.  The whole problem is the rod that lifts the plate and is supposed to catch to SET.  One one I cannot get the little thing to catch.. the trap won't set.  The other is easy to set but the plate does not come up...  I will get the time and I am going to have to try modifying the rod.  One trap wasn't good right off the bat.  The other did catch a few big coons and a fox but then it failed too.  I am not giving up...	-1
But the trigger mechanism to have it close is really lousy.  I've set this 3 nights in a row.  I test with a stick each time and the trigger seems to work.  Then the next day, no bait, no possum.  I press the trigger, no trap.  I'll now have to have my 6 year old help re-engineer the simple minded device I spent $100 bucks on.  for a company that's been making traps for so long, you'd think the trigger mechanism would be idiot proof.  I guess I'm the idiot it doesn't work for.	-1
This product seems well made, but it does not work. The trip mechanism to close the door can only be set in one position and in that position the trip platform is fully on the floor, which will not trip the door to close. When attempting to set it lighter it will not work at all. If you plan to catch an animal that is the size of a raccoon and weighs as much as a cow it might work it the animal jumps up and down on the trip platform repeatedly.	-1
I have always had to borrow a live trap from my rancher friends when I need one so decided to buy my own. This one is large enough for a coon. There is a problem with the catch that sets the trap door. I had noticed in the reviews someone else had the same problem. It takes a lot of strength to set it and a lot of time to get it to work. The instruction pictures do not show the same as what the trap actually is. I have yet to catch a coon in this one. With the borrowed one I have captured as many as nine in two weeks. Because of the catch on the door, I can't give it very good ratings. It is too much trouble to send it back.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/HAVAHART-CAGE-TRAP/dp/B001VJ4D66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">HAVAHART CAGE TRAP</a>	-1
This trap did the job of catching racoons after some modifications.  The first racoon trashed the gate to escape by breaking it loose from the flimsey fasteners.  The entire trap is put together with less than adequate tubular galvnized metal clips.  Being uanble to buy a suitable replacement locally, I fashioned some heavy aluminum wire rings so supplement the existing clips at strategic locations.  Also, the trip mehcanism at the gate is not made with sturdy wire and could cause future problems.  I won't say don't buy this trap, unless you don't like the idea of beefing up some critical points.	-1
Mine froze up after a month of use.  Wayne has been bought out by some larger corporation and their customer service has gone to hell.  They wanted me to pay the shipping back to Indiana from the fire zone in Northern California.  Not a good time for pump failure.  The supervisor ultimately paid for the shipping.  A few years ago, they would just send me a new one.  They have gone stingy.  Similar to Sears after their buy out.  I used to keep a couple of these on the shelf, now I need to find a new brand.  I got a response to this review saying that they have not been bought out but the parts I ordered for my new pump come from Campbell Hausfeld.	-1
The pump end cap was smashed as well as the electronics. Never had the chance to see if it worked. I am not happy with this pump due to the condition it came in. I would love to post pictures of the damage but I can't seem to figure out how to do that.	-1
I waited to review this product until I have used it for some time. The Wayne pump had replaced my Flotek sprinkler pump that had lasted me for over 10 years. Unfortunately, the Wayne product had only lasted me 2 years. I had made calls to the Wayne Company customer service with no help whats so ever. The Wayne pump is not a cheap buy. With that, I do not recommend Wayne products.	-1
I've bought 3 of these in the past few years; I guess I should know better, but the price is so much lower than any other comparable pump.  The original pump had motor problems and started running slow, not sure why or what happenned there.  I assumed that two years of hard service pumping river water with limited filtration had taken its toll, so I bought another identical pump as a replacement.  Unfortunately, the seal between the new pump and motor leaked, so the pump lost it's prime every time it was shut down.  It ran dry for a few minutes on the next startup, and fried the plastic pump parts in short order.  The lawn and garden were drying up, and had to get another pump quickly to avoid disaster.  The new one had another bad motor(!), but a good pump, so had to combine parts from the 2nd old pump and new motor to get one good working pump.  I suppose I should have returned it, but the shipping cost and the time involved prohibited that.  In the end, the multiple pumps cost me more than just buying one good expensive pump.  Lesson learned.	-1
I found out you have to purchase a separate regulator for this hose to fit. The hose that comes with my Mr. Heater can't be taken apart by the regulator. So I sent it back. No problems.	-1
Doesn't work even with new batteries.	-1
Bought it in November, hadn't used it yet (no rats). Just put it out this week. It doesn't work at all. Something is wrong with the mechanics/electrical. The return window closed after 60 days, but I'll still be calling Amazon to return it for a refund or replacement.	-1
Didn't work, couldn't catch any rat	-1
Worked really well the first few times and then something got stuck on the pressure plate causing it to zap thin air. I read on their site that you have to clean it every so often making sure to get the debris out but my hands are too big to fit. Plus I couldn't see what I was trying to clean. I ended up just tossing it out wasted money.	-1
Purchased two different brands of this type of trap for my tack room.  I have dogs and cats and so do my neighbors so poison is not an option.  I hate snap traps.  So far I still have a rat.  Not impressed.	-1
Has not work since I receive it. Malfunction soon as I turn it on. I still have my mouse running around my house and leaving scraping. Came in after new people move next door with a cat.. Guess he will be with me for Christmas since nothing I have gotten seems to work. This mouse is too smart!	-1
Not good. Worked for about  a day then stopped working.	-1
I bought 6 of these when they first came out...have they improved? and even after cleaning with specified vinegar they all stopped working...i was hoping for a better newer good working one.	-1
i didn't get it to work.  Good luck if you buy it.  I appreciate your time and feedback. If you have found my review helpful, please click the "Thumbs Up to let me know. Thank you!	-1
saw some videos showing this used outside. reckon they must be in southern california where it hardly rains? the slightest rain shorts out the zapper and unit blinks red as though already tripped. don't recommend. - get a metal cage trap instead	-1
I've had it out a week now and no rats trapped.  They've been in it...  One day I found it flipped over, another day found the light blinking, but no rats.  The fire ants sure do love the peanut butter I put in there though.  UPDATE:  We did manage to catch 1 rat but It finally went in the garbage.  Several mornings in a row found it with the blinking light on like it caught something, but nothing in the trap.  Looking more closely inside the trap I could see sparks flying.  Not sure what happened, if humidity tripped it?  I did have a camera on it all night and saw no animals going in.  But the fact that it tripped itself and had hot sparks jumping seems very very unsafe.	-1
Useless.  The 'zapper' stays engaged so long as there is a battery in it.  Save your money.  We had a rat infestation a few years ago and we tried everything:  this product, several poisons, snap-traps and glue traps.  The glue traps, with some small help from the snap traps and an even smaller contribution, did the job.  Just place them along the walls (rats run along walls) and you'll get them.  No bait required b/c this way you get them in transit.	-1
Very low quality. I've run Rat Zappers for years and this latest version is super cheap. No longer working after two weeks.	-1
Didn't catch any mouse or rats.  Waste of money	-1
The light stayed on immediately. 'Had to return and purchased another model.	-1
They worked for two rats then they no longer work.	-1
Received zapper worked great for three kills....so I ordered more...each one died (followed manufacturers instructions) for cleaning, replaced batteries. Still not working. My other one died after two kills. They were used indoors and manufacturers instructions were followed to the t.	-1
First set we got, had to be returned as they stopped working and never caught a thing. They sent new ones at no charge, so we appreciate them trying to do the right thing, but honestly, I have never ever caught a mouse or rat or anything else. I gave them a 2 star for the effort of helping me resolve the first set not working, but honestly my dog has caught about 3 rats in the last year and rat zapper has a big fat zero!	-1
It's killed 1 large rat, his entire torso filled the trap, oddly enough I had just changed. Battery's, curiously or odd luck, the eat was DEAD, I'm going to get a car for backup	-1
The critter (mouse, chipmunk or rat) keeps stealing the bread I leave in and around the trap, and the light registers a kill, but no corpse is there.  It is of course possible that something is taking the dead animal away before I get to it, but that would be difficult in this narrow spot without knocking the trap over, so I'm pretty convinced that the trap just isn't strong enough to kill the critter. I've got brand new batteries in there and the area around the trap, especially near the entrance, is moist.  I've ordered a unit that uses C cell batteries rather than this, which uses AA.  Frankly, I'm confused how other people are seeing any success with this thing.  Note: I'm using it outside (appropriately protected), so peanut butter or apples don't work as bait because they get covered in ants. Bread is taken every night.	-1
Didn't work. Tried various things. Bait gone several times, until I think the rats figured it was a trap, then they left it alone.	-1
Worked well for awhile but started shorting out. Tried cleaning it with the same result.	-1
I set the trap and made sure I had really fresh and strong batteries in it.  I came back to find a day later the food gone, the trap blinking and no rodent.  It did not work for me as they got the food and got away.	-1
Something keeps tripping it as if catching something but nothing is ever found in there. Back to using Victor snap traps.	-1
I have purchased (2) units, a family member had (4)....for BOTH OF US...these only worked a very short time and then would have electrical issues.  After researching online how to clean, I cleaned both very carefully and still both broken.  Buy old fashioned rat traps and don't throw your money away like I did...approx $90 down the drain.	-1
Not Happy at all! I purchased a Hoont and despite problems, the company responds to my challenges and offers suggestions. I purchased this from Tyler Puckett store. It caught one mouse and then no more, despite cleaning the plates and putting in more bait again and again. The mice walk in and eat whatever I put in there and leave. Their paw prints are all over. It has brand new batteries. I asked to return it, thinking it was the Standard 30 dayy Amazon return policy. No. So warning. Puckett only allows two weeks. Not really a decent amount of time to try out a device like this. I do have Victor ones that work well, however, only hold one mouse so I thought with great reviews I would try this one for a change. An expensive mistake. Make sure you READ the amount of time allowed to return it. I still could not find it on the site, however it is only 14 days with this company.	-1
Not worth the money at all. Simple chipmunk traps, clear plastic, two for $13 sold at Amazon is so much better, simple, cheap, and works!	-1
Right out of the box it did not work.  I put the batteries in and the green light never came on after trying several new batteries.  Maybe I just got a faulty one because others have given great reviews.	-1
Got this to take care of a mouse or rat that I think may be hiding in the wall as there is alway poo on the step. Followed directions although there is no Green light, it's a quick red light. Came back in the morning, some food was gone, light was flashing. No catch. Cleaned and reset and it makes a buzzing sound now. Will wait a day, try once more, and report if successful. Otherwise, a disappointment.	-1
Rats ran right around it.  Didn't even give it a look.	-1
Returned 2 of these. Tried 3 different brands of batteries and none of them gave me the green light. Don't bother with this unit	-1
This didn't work for beans. I placed this just like the directions said, kept it dry, put the food in the right spot, and the rats walk right on by and eventually end up in the trap I should have set in the first place. I should have saved my money.	-1
Waste of money.  never did catch anything with it.  Has a strong "new plastic" odor, and that may be turning the rats away from it..	-1
We have now had 2 of these traps set up for a week, under the racks our woodpile sits on - rats are definitely living in the woodpile. We've tried several different baits, to no avail. Nothing has happened. The rats are apparently too smart to go for these things.	-1
it wouldnt kill anything. too weak, water will destroy it as well.	-1
Never caught a rat with this expensive toy. Other simpler, cheaper, more traditional traps placed nearby have all caught rats.  I think the problem is the "cave" design, which makes it hard for typically shy rodents to get close enough to the food. Plus, you can't place wet food inside (like peanut butter, the perennial favorite).  I suppose a plus to this design is that I've never hurt my fingers trying to set it.	-1
While it worked it worked great, but after about 8 mice killed it stopped working. It was an electronic problem I could hear and see the arching.	-1
So far score rat +1 human 0 the rat somehow ate the bait without being electracuted. I put a piece of a tortilla chip with a bit of cheese in the back of the trap as directions specified. I found the chip at the front of the trap no cheese. Talk about a f___ you! So far the trap doesn't work!	-1
DOESN'T WORK!! Stopped working after a couple of months. I opened two of them a few months after purchase.... I only needed two at the time, just opened  one now at the beginning of December.... it doesn't work.... right out of the box.!!! Apparently too late to return! Very upsetting. DON'T BUY THESE!!	-1
Piece of junk. It never worked properly.	-1
Just bought two traps in IL based on the performance of two I have in AZ that have been killing critters for a couple of years/ rain or shine. The two new ones I bought stopped after the first two kills. Something must have changed in the design or manufacture. Probably made in China. There are too many reviewers with the same experience, short life span for $35.00. Try another zapper and save the aggravation.	-1
Put new batteries in it, but some bait in it in the back like you are supposed to, both mequite pods and a red grape.  Turned it on and the red led flashed for a second and went off like it is supposed to. Checked the trap in the morning and all the bait was gone- no dead rat/mouse and no flashing kill led. Put it back in its box after removing the batteries and got and RMA and returned it. I will go back to a live trap method.	-1
When it works, it works great. I left a five star review after using it less than a week because it was so effective. Then it quit working after just three weeks of use and good luck trying to locate the rat zapper company. I contacted their only listed contact twice and I was never contacted back. Horrible! Contacted Amazon I was given a refund through them. Buyer beware!!	-1
Didn't catch any rats while my spring-loaded traps caught over a dozen.	-1
DOES NOT WORK EVEN WITH DAMP RAG , EVEN MICE NAY !	-1
Sucks. You'll spend more in batteries. Never caught one rat.....  Old school method got  em all.	-1
Hmm, I've gotten three flashing red lights and lost three things of bait, but have not "caught" anything yet. I don't know if I'm pleased with the effectiveness of this item, but at least the vermin around my house are well fed with all these bait trays of peanut butter they're getting.	-1
No dead rats. No interested rats entering. Maybe I have Einstein rats? Whatever, it didn't serve its purpose, but at least Amazon has a great return policy.	-1
Doesn't work.  Have bought electronic rat zappers in the past that worked great.  This one is has attractive packaging, but the rodents who visit my backyard did not visit it.  Had to go back to using my old Victor electronic traps, which immediately took care of the problem.	-1
Well, this thing is a turkey.  Buy a real rat trap!  I may put it on the coffee table as a conversation piece.  In addition to not working well in dry conditions, it really doesn't like even dampness and the "catch" lite will go on if the bait gets damp at all.	-1
It worked fine for 4 or 5 rats and then started to get persnickity.  It would trigger and no rat would be in the trap,  or it would not trigger and the bait would be gone.  I suspect this device is very dainty concerning any dust or oils left by the rats and anything will cause it to dysfunction.	-1
It kills mice and chipmonks without a problem.  No rat problem so I don't know.  But it quit working after about a year.  I cleaned it as per the instructions.  It did not help.  It does not seem to be weather proof. I took it apart and it looked corroded.  It did kill a lot of mice before it died.  I would put the mouse to Rat Zapper death ratio at about 50 to 1.	-1
I would have returned this item but I waited too long.  This thing is labeled wrong.  I have not killed one rat.  I have killed one small field mouse (6 inches nose to tip of tail).  I have rats coming into my shed.  I don't like using rat poison as my neighbors have dogs and I don't want them eating a dead poisoned rat (although the poison works great).  I've tried rat traps (the big ones) and they manage to get out of them,  I've placed bait in the zapper, come out the next morning and see the light flashing, but no dead rat.  I even swapped fresh batteries and still no luck.  If you have rats this one won't do the trick.  Not sure I'd spring for the bigger model.	-1
I bought this product because I have a couple dogs and thought it would be safer then a standard trap for them.  I have killed one rat in 6 weeks.  But I notice I have to keep replacing the bait (I use dry dog food) so something is eating it.  I also get the red flashing light every few days that signals that something should be dead in the trap, but it is empty.  Not sure it is the most effective product but I really wanted to love it.  I would not purchase again.	-1
Unhappy with this product because it cannot get wet and it rains here every day. Put it out on a dry, no-rain day and it was triggered by a rat. Problem? The rats are too big for the trap and the trap was found in the morning 2-feet away, upside down, and empty!	-1
After few days outside the electrical system went dead. On the first day of operation, I got one dead rat. After that, nothing. After that I returned it.	-1
does the job. not sure why it is so narrow. sometimes the target animal will drop the peanut butter/sesame seed combo. i will have a tough time sticking my hand in there to retrieve it and clean up afterwards.  it is supposed to be for indoors only, i was using it out of doors, and hoped it was properly sheltered from the rain.	-1
I was not impressed with this rat zapper.  I didn't find any rats wiling to enter it.  It wasn't weather friendly.  It was expensive compared to other means of dealing with rodents.  I am not a fan.	-1
I caught just one rat with this trap...followed the directions to a tee.  I am not disappointed that I wasted my money on this purchase.	-1
This device got a couple rats then stopped working.  Several times the bait was gone so it doesn't trigger very well.	-1
I read the instructions, tried exactly as stated but the rats wouldn't go it in.  Period.  I went to glue traps after sending this back. Caught a rat on the first night and then on the second. No more rats.	-1
the instructions say to put bait in it before turning it on to get the rats used to it. I did that; they ate the bait. Now, when its "off" the rats eat the bait. When its "on', the rats won't go in it. all that I can figure is they get some kind of feeling or non-lethal warning before they go in. it has caught nothing. It has been in use for weeks. the rats just wait for me to turn it off to see if I can get them back in it; then its free meal time.	-1
So sorry--had to return this because it would not catch any critters.  I have been using the old-fashioned wire cages, but then have to dispose of the dead rats--no fun at all.  I thought this would save the yuck factor, but it did not attract anything at all even though I followed the instructions to the letter.  Good concept, though--hope it works for you.	-1
It could just be me or the rodent I was chasing. Followed all the advice, not touching it and therefore imparting scent on the trap. Put in some type of bait without batteries so rodent would feel safe going inside. I put my web camera pointed at the trap and saw the rat walk around it, take out the bait without the battery turned on, walk on top of the device and leave. Put in more of the same food while wearing gloves, checked the batteries, and the rat would not go in. Again it walked all around and on top but would not go in with the batteries turned on. Put in another set of batteries which showed a high charge in the tester. Watched it go everywhere but in the trap, again. Went and bought another trap made by Victor and threw in the bread crumbs and grain. Put it next to Rat Zapper Classic and turned it on in the evening. Two hours later, the rat went in the Victor and that was the end of the rat. The only reason I gave it 2-stars is because the trap may be okay based on other reviews, and maybe it is making some sound only a rat can hear and this trap is faulty. The batteries were also hard to install.	-1
This is NOT good product if you have rats or rodent problems. I had the previous version and it worked. It is now ineffective. The new item takes four AA batteries. I put it out and went out several times to see the light blinking (this signals that there was a kill), but there was nothing there. The previous version had several kills (although the batteries wore out quickly).  After trying this one night with  no kills and constant rechecking, I am sending it back. There must be a better product out there. Not sure if this would kill a knat!	-1
the ones I received are not of poly-cotton. They are of polyester or a similar material. My original thought was to use it to block the sunshine to my front porch. But the material was too thin to serve the purpose. Also, there are stains in some of the flags ( I bought 6). The one I opened had a white stain ( of a quarter size) on the blue. If this is the " made in the USA", then we got nothing to be proud of.	-1
the material flimsy,  packaged poorly, came very wrinkled. The colors are like a thick paint on cheesecloth material.. don't know how others were able to iron them out without ruining their irons. Only has two grommets,  one on each end so when hung, no matter how tight you pull, the center droops. Yeah, you can tap a nail in the center. But when it rains rust will seep out around the nail looking tacky. I would think they could at least have better packaging if for no other reason, show a little respect.	-1
Ordered these and was disappointed that the quality was not what I had expected from Valley Forge but was going to live with them. Needed two more and after ordering these DIRECTLY FROM AMAZON instead of this seller I received two completely different, higher quality buntings with Valley Forge tags stating they were made in the USA. I then checked these buntings and sure enough...made in China and no Valley Forge Tag. Appears seller is passing these off as something they are not. Amazon is taking them back of course but a hassle thanks to this seller.	-1
Didn't hold up to use. metal inside weakened and fell apart. Less than two years use.	-1
too small for the bar	-1
This string completely unwound in about 15 seconds sending out plastic shrapnel that cut my ankles.  I have restrung my Grasshog dozens of times and this hasn't happened with other string.  I tried a second time and the same thing happened except I was wearing heavy boots & pants to keep the bleeding to a minimum.	-1
I don't know what we are doing wrong. We soak them. Dry them a bit. And they keep putting out the charcoal.	-1
very coarse	-1
Bought a large spool thinking it would last a long time in a Black and Decker GH1000 machine.  Both top and bottom spools were chewed up in few minutes.  String seems too tough for the cutter on machine to chop when extra string is fed out.  I replaced the string with some other brand and it worked well.  Seems to be this particular string and not the machine.	-1
Disappointed not much of an apple taste I have had much better apple wood	-1
This Poulan chain just isn't up to scratch - it was creating sawdust not chips and needed excessive force to cut (yes, it was mounted in the correct direction) Maybe I just got a bad one, I don't know, but I do know that I recently put an Oregon bar and chain on my 400E and now it is better than I ever remember it being, even when new. I can't therefore recommend this chain, despite it being inexpensive.	-1
Not the desired flavour as expected even after following the instructions on 5 occasions	-1
This was used in my initial smoking of pork ribs. Since I didn't really know what I was doing, these chips imparted very little flavor to the meat. After receiving many tips from fellow smokers, I suspect I was at fault and will do the procedure much differently next time. I find the discussions from users very helpful.	-1
Buy local. Wood is wood.	-1
Well, I bought this for our deck so we could easily see the temp outside.  But it is completely inaccurate.  I went ahead and bought a regular mercury thermometer and it does a great job.  This is very pretty - I love the picture - but what's the use if it won't tell you the correct temp?  Save your money and buy mercury.	-1
The chips are way to small so it takes a ton to get a good smoke. Get a larger size chip.	-1
Really cheaply made. I had one, made by this same company, that was painted Plaster-Of-Paris that lasted for years. This one is all very flimsy plastic. I didn't even bother to hang it on my screened patio. I would not recommend this to a friend, and would not buy it again.	-1
Not made for outdoor use, open Back, draws moisture every night and you can not see through the plastic front until the sun dries it, goodness knows what winter will do to it with the coil exposed.	-1
sorry, but this broke in a few weeks after placing it outside. the plastic cover fell off and the temp is way off! update.... NOW look what happened!  the return "window" closed may 19 - eight days ago!  Springfield Star Low Profile Patio Thermometer (13.25-inch) Sold by: Amazon.com LLC Return window closed on May 19, 2017	-1
It's a pretty thermometer but you cannot see the numbers because it is so dark colored.	-1
Terrible quality, I cut three peach tree limbs and tore it up the same day I opened the package. This is the second one, it's not like I cut down a pine or redwood, just little peach tree limbs	-1
Cheap and unsafe	-1
You might want to wear gloves while assembling this "beast". The edges are VERY sharp. This hibachi is small and the materials are cheap - REAL CHEAP, but it does do its job. The pan is shallow - and dangerous (did I mention the edges are SHARP?), also after one use, the bottom will begin to rust where the heat from the briquettes has scorched the paint off. The wooden handles crack after the first use, so be prepared to spend time keeping them together. The grill holders seem flimsy, but I'll give it credit, it is capable of holding a large fat steak. But hey! What can you expect for something inexpensive that's made in a third-world country??	-1
Metal is so thin it can't even hold meat on the grill bits without the upright bending over and bouncing up and down, knocking the food around/off the grill/into the coals. So unstable as to be useless.	-1
This is a low grade, made in China, sheet metal, flimsy piece of junk. If you want a one-use and throw it away grill for the beach or lake, this might be it. Otherwise, get the cast iron Hibachi.	-1
This string is too thick, shreds mercilessly and is impossible to pull tight for trussing and, even if you do, it then stretches during cooking. Useless!	-1
cleaned thermo pane window with alcohol pad it falls off faster than i can put it up...no good!	-1
Needle spring is not dampened, so reading will shimmy like a rabid chimp on crack if you so much as look at it funny. Not able to see how this could conceivably be used in mobile settings.	-1
I bought 2 of these and tried to stick them on the outside of freshly cleaned windows and a sliding glass door and they looked like they were on good but overnight then would fall off. I tried so many different ways to get them to stay on and they fell off so many times that the thermometer function broke on both of them.	-1
Off by 10 degrees, but will use with that in mind.	-1
Easy to install. Temperature reading is off from 2 other thermometers I use by approx. 8 degrees even if adjusted to correspond. RATHER DISAPPOINTING. I now use it as an "approximated" tool.	-1
Was ok.  But didn't come with the set screws to keep it secure on the rotisserie bar.  Further they should design it so the rotisserie bar is outside of the basket instead of right through the middle.  Wouldn't buy again until improved.	-1
Nowhere in the description does it say it will not fit an 1/2 rod.  I had a cook out planned and spent 30 mins modifying this basket  If it wasn't for the cookout, I would have sent these back.  Update the product info to reflect it WLL NOT FIT 1/2 RODS.	-1
Metal part bends VERY easily, and the edges are very jagged so they cut up your food on the grill.  Returned and bought the weber version instead <- unfortunately the weber version isn't much better....but definitely better for the same price.  Returned the grillpro.	-1
I bought this kit, and turns out with a little research I could've saved money in buying the items separately.  It took about 10 days before I started cutting into the grass to juice.  It was tall and green.  I battled knats and mold.  Used grapefruit seed extract to control mold to no avail.  I manually juiced this, drank less than an ounce and got really sick.  I puked it back up in less than 10 minutes of ingestion and it had already turned a dark blackish green in my stomach.  I'm not sure if it's the spores, mold and decay somewhere in the grass or simply that it's too immature to drink at this stage being that many companies who sell wheatgrass powders will state that it takes 200 days for the grass to be ready for juicing.  So 10 days versus 200 is a stretch and that probably explains why my grass was so sweet.  I am not going to juice this myself.  It is too time consuming to grow, tend to and juice to end up on the couch with stomach cramps.	-1
These skewers are Not long enough!  We had to use kitchen gloves to keep from blistering our hands from the flames.  The triangular shape is nice, but doesn't make up for having your hand so close to the flames.	-1
The plastic handles immediately detached with the first use. Think about it. Plastic handles for a barbecue implement. Who is dumber: me for buying it and using it or amazon for selling it? They got the money and I got the weenie.	-1
It came in one piece, undamaged, but has razor sharp edges on the top, bottom, heat shield and handle bracket that need deburring. Good thing I unpacked it carefully.  It's pretty thin metal and probably won't last long, but will only be used as a backup when the electric starter fails. The price of $10 is good, and I won't  return it.  Sadly, it used to be the foreign made metal products that had sharp edges, and Americam Made was the sign of ultimate quality.  I began ro debur it and cut my little finger without knowing it for a while!  Be careful!	-1
Worked 3 times, then done!	-1
Chimney didn't last long and is made cheaply. Pay a little extra and get the Weber instead.	-1
This product did not work out of the box. It was so inexpensive, under $10, I didn't bother to return just threw out.	-1
This stuff is so weak it breaks just from spinning.  The spool of it I wound around the standard bobbin was gone in less than a minute, shattering all over the place.	-1
The balancer is a very simple plastic thing that probably would have worked IF it was designed for John Deere blades for my 42" riding lawn tractor.  Problem is, the balancer has many steps in the cone that needs to fit into the center hole in the blade to work.  The hole size on my blades didn't fit any of the balancer steps so the product did not work for me.	-1
junk it is all plastic if you drop it is gone they was made of metal once upon a time	-1
We had to return this because of damaged product and case.  I'm not sure if this was a shipping or quality issue, but we ended up returning it and going with something else.	-1
We spent $69 and when winter comae it didn't work.  :O( I wil hurt to reorder and take the time to put up another run. I am too tired to figure out WHO I ordered from and if they would even help, after7 months. I would not get a product where you can not contact the vendor for an exchange of a product that works. karen	-1
Not reliable and flimsy roof clips. Tool many "if" when using the sensor.	-1
died after 1 week	-1
Plugged it in and it worked. Installed it, plugged it in and it worked. First snowstorm happened, plugged it in and it did not work. A giant waste of money and time. Don't let them rip you off like they did to me. Look elsewhere.	-1
Works OK, but be prepared to pay BIG TIME for your electric bill. We have 2 of these, and our bill went from $130 a month to over $400 after we plugged them in. We thought it was a mistake at first, but after a few days of checking/troubleshooting the KW usage on our meter, it was obvious this was what caused the drastic jump. We won't be using them anymore, except when we get a big snow.	-1
Worked for less than a year. Blows fuses. Cant get a replacement from the manufacturer or amazon. Very disappointed .	-1
DIDNT WORK AT ALL...MY GUESS IS YOU HAVE TO KEEP THESE ON FOR DAYS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO WORK	-1
While we had great hope for the 200 foot cable, it proved completely ineffective (in Connecticut.)  We purchased the cable together with the thermostat (Easy Heat RS-2 Automatic Roof De-Icing Cable Control).  A roofing contractor installed the cables and thermostat.  Precisely as per instructions.  Soon enough, we realized that the cable control didn't work at all.  Regrettably, we only found out after considerable ice dams had built up and water damage had created havoc inside the house (we had installed an entirely new roof a mere three months ago and had covered the roof entire surface with an ice and water barrier shield.)  In an effort to mitigate further problems, we circumvented the cable control (thermostat.)  Again, it was of no use.  The cable, while emitting some heat, did not control the ice build-up at all.  We will remove the cables after the winter.  It is tremendously regrettable.  We certainly believed that after installing an entirely new roof (with allegedly over-the-top water-proof measures taken), the cable would add another (theoretically unnecessary) layer of security.  Instead, we will be battling not only the weather in the remaining winter months, but with the roofing contractor and the insurance company as well.	-1
Does't produce enough heat to melt an appreciable amount of snow or ice.	-1
Did not melt much of the ice on roof or gutters.  it melts about 1/4 of an inch around the wire but that's about it.  I ran it 24/7 and ended up with a $200+ extra on my electric bill.  Now this thing is just sitting in my junk bin.	-1
This worked in testing the pH of the soil, but the N, K, and P tests did not work.	-1
not that great	-1
I'd pass. you mix dirt and water and the color it turns it supposed to give you a reading. It always just turns brown.	-1
I've had hose reels like this before and they lasted several years.  This one broke within 3 months.  It wasn't that expensive, but it should have lasted through at least one summer!	-1
Purchased and installed 6 months ago and it is ready to snap and break already.	-1
I don't understand all the glowing reviews. It is cheap, and a pleasant neutral color. Mine just barely holds a 75' hose, with the loops hanging just over three feet down. The coiled hose comes all the way to the top of the front part. I had it screwed to a wooden fence, and the weight of the hose bent the plastic and pulled it off the screws. So I attached a ledger board to the fence and used bigger screws and washers, which seems to work.	-1
Plastic was weak it fell off the wall	-1
Good	-1
inaccurate follow the directions and used distilled wated. The tests always got readings saying my nitrogen levels are deplated phropaus levels normal and potassium levels normal. Well I took soil samples and send it off they said my n is alittle high my p is excessively high and my potassium is also excessively high. Also even the ph is off it says my soil at 6" after 6 different spots and mix it said it was 6.5  and the college told me it was 7. don't waste money on this stuff if anything send your soil samples off to the colleges in your state with more accurate readings.	-1

This loooks sturdy but came with no hardware. The masonary screws will cost more then the product itself. Just have to laugh.	-1
I bought this to test potassium and phosphorous levels in my 700 gallon aquaponics system.  The goal was to allow phosphorous and potassium adjustments that helped the plants and did not hurt the fish.  While I have the API Freshwater Master Test kits that do a fair job for PH, Ammonia, Nitrites, and Nitrates, there are few test kits available for potassium.  When using the Leaf Luster Test kit, all potassium and phosphorous tests showed adequate levels of phosphorous and potassium ... regardless of the sample source.  I tried plain rain water to water with small samples of pure chemical phosphorous and pure potassium, performed the tests as directed, waiting the required time.  All tests showed "Adequate" levels.  These results are not useful to help with minor adjustments that benefit the plants and don't hurt the fish.  I have since purchased the API GH and KH Test kit and the API Phosphate test kit.  Both kits, all three tests, seem to be working well and have helped understand the chemistry of the system.  I'm still looking for a better potassium test.	-1
This did not come with the screws that are needed to attach it to the house.  None of the screws I have will work (a really large head is needed) so I literally have to take this thing to Home Depot or Lowe's to figure out a screw size.  That's a bit silly, don't ya think?	-1
Kind of difficult to use for most tests. Not what I was looking for.	-1
Failure rate is extremely high on these sure pop series sprinklers. I have over 20 of these installed in my yard and half of them have failed within 4 years. Since broken sprinklers are not necessarily noticed immediately, any failure can lead to huge wasted water costs. I've since replaced all of them with the 1800 series or unibody series sprinklers.	-1

I equipped my entire, three-zone backyard system with Rain Bird Sure Pop 600 sprinklers. They worked quite well for about 3 years, and then the riser seals started to go bad. The seals started to calcify and became warped, causing sprinklers to leak and/or not pop up at all. I tried cleaning the seals and soaking in CLR, but this did not solve the issue.  Ordinarily, this would not be a problem. Buy replacement seals, install, and you're as good as new. HOWEVER, Rain Bird does not individually sell the riser seals, leaving you to purchase an entirely new sprinkler ($3-9) JUST to get a seal from the new unit. This would be a 4-5 star review if Rain Bird would individually seal riser seals.	-1
I tested this against an old meter and at least one element,  pH is not accurate. Basically it's hard to use, to distinguish colors, i.e. levels. This kit is not of value to me. Would not buy again.	-1
Wasn't impressed with this product. I didn't feel like it was accurate. Good for a hobbyist but not for horticulture applications.	-1
This was totally inaccurate.  The tests told me (I tested it twice) my yard was depleted of nutrients, however when tested by our local university I found that I was heavily over fertilized.  I relied on the test on several occasions and ended up wayyyyyyy over fertlizing my grass.	-1
Totally inaccurate - if it reads at all.	-1
Can not trust it.	-1
Seems I wasted my money. 1st test of my soil, nitrogen, phosphorus and potash test results were all > 7.5. Waited one day (as per instruction for clay soil), tested same soil sample and was deficient in nitrogen, .  Either this tester is useless, or I need a more accurate tester.  No help to me.  :(	-1
Should have named it Shadecast, can't handle the sun ~1.5 years old only gets winter sun (Florida) became brittle and shredded like China junk should. See actual pic below, 50' hose -  better install it where the Sun Never Shines !!!	-1
This only measures Ph up to 7.5 so it is pretty much worthless if you are working with alkaline soil.	-1
Cancled this order I am not sure why	-1
The ad says it will hold a 150 foot hose. I placed a 100 foot hose on it soon after receiving and it just failed this week. The plastic tore in two places around the holes where the screws hold to the post . My hose is a 3/4 in., very typical so the ad certainly should be changed. I bought another one and have a 50 foot hose on it. Perhaps the ad should be 50 feet and not 150 feet of hose.	-1
This was hard to do and hard to read.  Unless you are a soil specialist you may want to go another route.	-1
it lasted 1 summer...its what u pay...	-1
A total piece of crap. It does not take a rocket scientist to look at why this falls apart . They cut out so much plastic out from the back of this where it mounts on the wall, that it is weakened so much it will not support the weight of the hose especially if you have left the water on, I got 2 weeks out of it and found my hose and it on the ground with the hanger in pieces. These must be employees commenting on this. Look at the design, it is doomed to failure!	-1
I performed a few tests on the same soil and got different results each time, except for nitrogen which was always completely depleted regardless of where I retrieved the sample from. My yard, my raised beds, my neighbor's yard all tested 0 for nitrogen. I'm glad I tested other areas or I would have erroneously added nitrogen. Not just nitrogen but every test included (except PH) had results of being very depleted including Miracle Grow Garden Soil fresh from the bag. On the other hand, the PH was consistently high at between 7 and 7.5 on all soil tested. My husband, because of the line of work he does, has access to an expensive and accurate PH tester and the same soil tested between 6 and 6.5 on his equipment.  Wish I could give a better review but, if you're like me, you put way to much work and money into your garden to throw caution to the wind. I'll be looking for something else.	-1
Kit was missing the 40 powder capsules needed to do the tests. I've returned it and am buying a different brand.	-1
I hung this on my fence for 100' of heavy duty hose, not the cheap hose.  The plastic ripped and the entire mount and hose fell to the ground.  So if you have 100' of heavy duty hose, buy a metal version.	-1
Useless.	-1
I first ran the test on some known depleted soil. It gave very high PK and I knew something was wrong.  So I ran on tap water, then distilled water. High P, High K, Zero N.  Color develops whether or not these minerals are "high" at least in terms of soil because I didn't add any soil.  If you look at other Amazon postings of "Rapitest Soil Test Kit" you will find other complaints with the exact same results. It's unfortunate that this posting doesn't have the same critical reviews.	-1
Never again	-1
This is garbage. Why can't I give this <1 star?  I have used 8 of the 10 ph test caps(all on different sources) and all have come back at >7.5(don't know what the actual value is.) The Digital rapitest soil test part of this thing only goes up to 7.5. I did a test on plain peat, guess what the test was? 7.5 on the tester, though the color was orangish. As opposed be the 7.5 test on other potting soil that was deep green.  The tests may work fine, idk. But I know the tester does not work at all for PH. So why should I trust it for anything else.	-1
Sure not all it's cracked up to be..... It is not easy... Get soil... Mix with distiller water... Wait twenty four hours... Put water sample in test kit... You get the picture..l	-1
I give it two stars for claiming to be exactly what I was looking for.  I have a hydroponics setup, new this summer after a great experience in 2014 with a less ambitious setup.  After my second water and nutrient change on "Thursday" I found my new leaves on especially the Lemon Boy tomatoes coming out yellow.  A lot of online research indicated that this was a text book case of iron deficiency, strange since the water I start out with certainly has iron in it.  The online research indicated that the most common cause of an apparent iron deficiency was a pH that was too high for the plants to assimilate and process the iron from the nutrient solution.  The most desirable pH range was fairly narrow.  That is the problem with most of the chemical-indicator processes.  Reading a color chart in slight variations of color from one end of the desired range to the other is problematic.  This package shows a huge change in hue over a very narrow range exactly where one needs it.  I have photos.  I started with my Deep Purple from the Red Cabbage Tea.  I put a little lemon juice in water into one beaker and some horticultural lime in another.  I got a nice clear pink in the lemon-water and a nice clear blue in the lime-water.  Cool !  Very colorful !  My hydroponics nutrient solution came out a very nice lavender.  GREAT !  It appeared that I was very near neutral but I know I need to be a little acidic ... no real color chart with the Deep Purple made from Red Cabbage with De-ironed Softened tap water out in the country.  Surely in the ballpark.  The Luster Leaf pH kit gave me an excellent indication of pH 6.5.  beautiful.  The silly aquarium dip strips said I was way off the scale to the acid end of their useful range.  Given that the Luster Leaf pH kit gave me good agreement with my expectations on several solutions I decided that I needed a lot more of those little pH capsules.  My research so far says that they are just not available, though there was a package at my ACE Hardware store where I got my pH kit on CLEARANCE where I could buy three more capsules for about $3.00.  BUMMER.  I seem to have all I can get for any reasonable price.  I don't see the pH ONLY kit for sale, either ! I also bought aquarium test strips and I made some solution from a red-cabbage tea.  See YouTube.  UPDATE:  Further research shows that I took the wrong tack.  Bought chelated metals and added to Hydroponics solution, which promptly precipitated.  Clear indication of acidic nutrient solution as the cause of my iron deficiency.  Following up on Red Cabbage violet test result: closer to pH4, WAY OFF, like the Jungle Aquarium Test Strip Said.  The nominal pH 6.5 indication from the Luster Leaf pH kit was also "Way Off" and I was wrong to use it to validate my wild guess about the red cabbage test.  I have ordered more STUFF from Amazon ... where all the 50-mL beakers came from.  Getting a pH meter, TDS tester, calibrator solutions.  The follow up result now is that I put too much miracle grow (MG) into my system, which lowered my nutrient solution pH way out of the range desired by my tomato plants.  One more follow up NOTE:  There are many pH color scales on the internet, many associated with the red cabbage "method."  Not all of those are "correctly associated" with the red cabbage "method".  I now believe it is worth my time to use the inexpensive equipment I have ordered to develop a familiarity with the red cabbage tea in the pH range I am interested in.  A GOOD pH electrode is only good for a year to 18-months at best.  They get slower and slower and then cleaning does no good at all.  Rebuild or replace it.  Most don't last that long under ideal conditions.  It is expensive, witchy science in anybodies lab.  Develop alternative methods while the gadget is working.	-1
Maybe its me, but too much of an ordeal to test..	-1
too small	-1
I bought this kit to test soil from my lawn and garden hoping it would provide a general idea of next steps to improve the situation.  The kit itself is fairly straightforward. 4 plastic containers (1 PH, 1 N, 1 P, 1K) and 40 test tablets, 10 for each container. Instructions are printed on the inside of the packaging, which means you'll need to keep it around. I would prefer smaller, separate instructions so I could recycle the packaging. They included other materials anyway, why not just add the instructions there?  I used the PH test but question the results. Last year I brought a soil sample into a local feed store where they ran a test and confirmed that we have very acidic soil, somewhere in the nature of 5.5. I added a little bit of lime (nowhere near the recommended amount), which MIGHT have increased it minimally. Testing my soil yesterday, results suggest that my soil is now neutral, most likely alkaline (7.5 plus). I highly doubt that is the case because of the previous test and the presence of specific weeds which typically indicate acidic soil. I'll give this kit a few more tries to see if it was a one time anomaly, but first impressions for it are not good.  Also be warned, it can be difficult to gauge where you rank on the color chart. I'm pretty sure the test was suggesting that my soil is alkaline, but the color was light enough to where it could be neutral. The problem being, if it is alkaline you would want to add something, sulfur I think, to bring the soil closer to 7. However, if it is truly neutral, then maybe a dash of compost for good measure. If the test is entirely wrong and my soil is acidic, which I believe to be the case, then adding anything to lower the Ph could be disastrous for the lawn and plants.	-1
I bought this to test soil...it doesn't work. Unit either displays highest or lowest value each time the button is pressed. Will contact LustreLeaf and see what they can do.	-1
I'm getting blue results. Not sure what that means, since blue is not on the scale.	-1
I had read the other reviews and was prepared for some of the problems getting small capsule contents into small container.  I made 4 separate triple foil sheets to catch any spills, 1 for each test with a colored capsule taped to it so no cross contamination.  I also kept my hands clean and washed and dried each container well & used a clean Q-tip to swab each container.   The first test was with my problem soil, taken as directed, mixed as directed, waited as directed then tested and waited again.  The results were baffling.   Test  #1  my compost with aged Alpaca poop.   On to test #2  after carefully washing and soil collecting, same baffling results.   On to test #3  My well water,  same baffling results.   On to test #4  Distilled water, new, unopened from a store.  Same baffling results:   Distilled water  well water  bad soil  compost   PH  #4 - 7.5 or higher.  #3  7.0  #2 7.0  #1  7.5   N (nitrogen) #4  none  #3 - none  #2 N2- adequate  #1 N4 - higher than surplus   P (Potash)  #4 K3 or K4 Surplus  #3 - K1 depleted  #2 K3 Sufficient  #1 K3 Sufficient   P (Phosphorus) #4  K4  Surplus  #3 - P4 Surplus  #2 P4 Surplus  #1 P4 Surplus    Since even the distilled water had both Prosperous and Potash above the scale,  I find the results useless.   It seems odd that everything but my alkaline well water had high  and maybe off the scale of Potash....   It seems odd that everything had high and maybe off the scale of Phosphorous... Nitrogen and PH.. well maybe - who knows.. I did my best to keep clean uncontaminated samples, and to get the entire contents of the capsules into the chamber, and wait. Nitrogen seemed to be the only reliable test, and I have a test kits from my fish tank days for that.  PH test seemed maybe ok.   The test chambers were badly designed, and that seems to be true for the industry.  It would be easy to design the test chamber so it would not fall over and be wide enough to easily empty the capsules into.   I had high hopes.... oh well, the luster is off the leaf for me.	-1
Looks, to me, as though all the positive reviews are based upon those reviewer's accepting that the results are accurate, without verifying it. My verification process found this kit significantly lacking.  I collected enough soil sample (2 cups for each) to meet the requirements of this test plus enough to submit to a large State agricultural university in this region of the Country. Nurserys in this highly populated region send their samples to this university for analysis. These two cups were well mixed and were filtered carefully to remove organic material and other non-soil materials.  I decided to test my soil, in the the first place, because the grass has been struggling for a few years. The university results showed that the pH was a full point (that's big) lower than the results from this test kit and the other tests were similarly different. This test kit indicates that my lawn is fine and can be left as is. The university says, through their results and recommendations, that I better get this lawn some emergency care!	-1
For every soil sample I tested this powder with, it indicated it was 7.5 ph.  I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5, which is the highest the meter will go so I'm assuming it's just bad powder.  I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester (also bought on here, good stuff), and it showed the real PH values (5.0 for my peat mix), 6.5 for my other regular soil.  So it gets to keep a star because I'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester.	-1
Got what I paid for...cheap product with unclear results.  I cannot say I would recommend wasting your money on this.	-1
Unfortunately got same results as many: low acidity and completely depleted nutrients.  Ran test again with new sample of soil from area that had been fertilized in last 6 weeks.  Same results.  Took remaining soil sample and added approximately 20% fertilizer (15-10-10). Still read as depleted.  I suspect the powdered capsules are out of date or contaminated in some way.  Waste of time.	-1
I this kit is no where near as accurate as the professional soil lab test results you can have done for a few dollars more. I do not recommend this kit after trying it and getting mixed results	-1
soil tester is mickey mouse.  I opened it and determined that it was a very cheaply made product. I didn't pay too much for it so i should not complain but I was asked to rate it so this is my view. It may last me this season.	-1
After testing 4 areas of soil and a couple of control tests, none of these test results could be trusted.  1. Tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon: pH read "6"... when it should have been the lowest value on the chart or more (pH of nearly 2 is lemon, so these tests give unreliably "alkaline" results). The purified water test also came out "alkaline".  All of the yard samples also came up as the most alkaline result, 7.5.  2. Tested freshly decomposed manure compost exactly to the package directions: none of the K, P, or N tests reacted at all after 10 minutes, 20, 30... or even 24 hours later. Manure compost should at least read "adequate" for nitrogen! None of the soil samples from the yard reacted either, so the indicating agent in the capsules is useless.  So, all in all, it was a tremendous waste of money and time.	-1
I used this kit several times for each of the tests.  I draw the sample and shake it well, allowing it to settle for at least a day.  You then draw a small sample of the "clear" solution.  After allowing the sample to mix with the precipitate, the particals coagulate and settle to the bottom.  Then the solution is always on the low end of the color spectrum.  Shake it, and the solution appears on the top end of the spectrum.  I guess if you let the sample sit for about 4 days, or may be a week or so, and carefully draw the solution for the test, you might get a better result. I really question the accuracy of this kit based on this.	-1
Mine broke within a month. I guess birds shouldn't land on it.	-1
cheap crap / returned to amazon	-1
This is a nice sturdy product but it doesn't work well on my deck railing.  I have a board railing with slats, rather than a thick beam, and the unit just falls off if bumped.  When I move it so it sets against the slat it doesn't lie flat on the top. I can secure it by putting another screw or bolt behind the rail, but it's not supposed to need that. If you plan to order these, get just one first, and make sure it will work for you before buying enough for all your petunias.	-1
But it's too much of a pain to use; it's much easier to stoop down and pick up the weeds the old fashioned way. You know, with your back. (I'm a tall tall guy.) Well, I had to try it.	-1
Its almost impossible to catch hold of a weed, espically if it has a taproot and pull it out. The metal piece drops down to far to allow the tines to grasph it	-1
As others have noted the material appears to be stainless steel and you would not want anything else.  The top grate holds in nicely and is adjustable.  However there are a few Cons: * The length of the basket will not hold a full length of spare ribs. * trying to be used across a too large a range of spit size makes the rod insecure in the attachment. * the bent metal piece that the screw goes through to attach to the spit is flimsy and bends when you get it tight enough to be secure. * Also, the spit goes through the basket taking space, the basket should be designed such that the spit is on the outside of the basket.	-1
Too small for my needs	-1
Great product BUT haven't captured one rabbit.  :-( Don't think I would purchase this again.  Sorry.	-1
This is maybe build for a small rabbit or squirrels. Its advertised for skunks which just isn't true. Unless you have a VERY small skunk, this isn't going to work. Not a single skunk will get his way into this tiny cage. You will need something much larger	-1
PROs Reasonable price Hand protection when moving animal Light Durable CONs A bit difficult to set trap with correct tension Easily flips closed before animal is trapped Does not work all that well	-1
construction looks good, but could not get to work	-1
We have another larger havahart trap that works great with only one entrance.  We have tried several different types of food for bait and it always gets stolen or sprung without trapping anything.  We even had a friend who is a trapper make sure we were using this right and we were but these are not effective for ground squirrels.	-1
Save your money.  Buy the one on Amazon that is green and tube-style.  That one works well as long as you do what I recommend in my review of that unit.  I've tried them side by side and the skunks will enter the 'tube' style over this 'cage' style trap every time.	-1
Very very hard to set the bait. I got it to catch the rabbit eating holes in my fence.  I finally just set it with NO BAIT and caught a squirrel (curiosity caught the squirrel?) I set Mr. Squirrel free in my yard.  I should probably have returned it.  Maybe I will concoct some kind of sticky vegetable bait that only rabbits like and are attracted to. Then, it might work.  If I ever catch Mr. Rabbit, he will be moving from the comfort of the the suburbs to the town woods or state park.	-1
Junk. The handle was coming off when they arrived. They do not open far enough and the mechanism that locks them has a mind of its own. Is there anything else to say?  I sent them back.	-1
I was getting ready to wash these once before I used them and they fell apart.  The red rubber grips came loose and I could not get them back on the wire they fit on.  I think these tongs were designed to open and close with a spring but that didn't work on either pair.  These are useless!!  But, because of the low cost, I'll just toss them instead of sending them back.  I know others reported the same thing happening but I decided to try them myself.  BIG MISTAKE!	-1
Horrible design.  Spring is not strong enough, lock falls into place whenever you close them, the handles pinch your hands. Poor. Poor. Poor.	-1
Photo is very deceiving!  These do not open up wide at all.  So if you have a thicker piece of meat or something you need turning, these aren't for you.  A total waste of my money.  I wish in the description(s) they would state how wide they open.  Do not buy unless you are flipping a pancake!	-1
not really that good.	-1
it doesn't work.. I had to return it.	-1
absolute piece of junk. You can fin this item in discount stores for about $10. It is Crap and is not siutable for cooking.	-1
This is a nice hibachi in design, cant say much else because the one I got arrived broken and filthy	-1
After about my 4th one of these, I switched over to the more expensive, but so worth it Sportman Grill.  This one is cheaply made and you food will fall onto the coals due to the adjustable slits being unevenly spaced.	-1
Product delivered today. Assembly instructions call for 4 (four) feet --items B,C,D and E. Unit comes with predrilled holes for feet attachment. Bolts and nuts sufficient to attach feet are uncluded  ----- NO FEET were included . i have spent 30 minutes assembling and still have no unit to use. If you are going to sell unassembled equipment then at least iclude all the parts to complete assembly. Shipping box is completely empty and broken down. The only excess parts are 8 nuts and bolts that would be needed to to attach the feet had they been included.	-1
junk ! rusted in a few months	-1
No hard use or anything of the sort. The bottom simply cracked in a zigzag from one corner to another, then the crack went up one side. Complete junk; materials are too thin to be safe. I've gone back to using the old hibachi I've had for more than 20 years. It's REAL cast iron.	-1
I bought this grill in hopes it would do me on my small grilling a few pieces of thin cut Korean style meat. I will have to do some grinding of the parts like the slots for the grill height or the grill rack itself. It is a shame that quality is tossed out the window to have things produced out side the US like China. I see this in many Items not just this product. I will do some grinding and it will work when I get finished. I will burn and oil the grills once I have them ground to fit correct. It is a shame that too many Items like this come from China.	-1
I will have to call customer support agan....hoping to get parts that match.  Instruction are easy to follow, but parts do not line up.  Holes do not line up for the grilling plates which causes one grill plate to be on a 15% angle.  Only way I can see to correct the problem would be to drill new holes then grind down one side to make fit.  I'm going to try customer support again for replacement parts....if that doesn't work I'm shipping back.  I purchased this as a gift, and now I'm in the middle trying to get this problem resolved.	-1
These are VERY Cheap constructed and with pointed ends that are poorly stamped	-1
These are so narrow, food just spins when you want them to turn them.  I will get much wider ones.	-1
Shorter and more flimsy than I'd hoped for.  Not bad enough to send back but I'm returning to storebought toothpicks that are at least a little stronger.	-1
Was made of cheap thin plastic I would imagine it would tear very easily sent it back	-1
Tissue thin. Extra small. Check the dimensions more carefully than I did.  if your washer is really that small, use a garbage bag. It's cheaper and probably just as durable.	-1
Cheap junk product, quality items are hard to find.  Works, but don't expect much. Try something else, good luck.	-1
Did not fit well and feels thin	-1
It fits but it doesn't meet with an expectation of lasting very long.  It is made of cheap material and I doubt it would last if it was covering outdoors.	-1
Comfortable but not treated at all for sun exposure as they should be.  In less than a month, they look severely faded & no longer match.	-1
very very very thin plastic -way too easy to acidentally tear it on one of the mowers parts. comes with a nice strap to secure it-but I would never re-buy as it's not going to hold up at all.	-1
I'm not crazy about the design of this cover, nor the thickness of the material.  In the past I'd use a tarp and some bungee cords.  It all worked well, but the idea of getting a fitted cover was appealing.  My mower isn't big and my expectations weren't unrealistic.  I'd be surprised if this lasts more than one season and getting it on my mower is no picnic - requires way too much effort.  Once it rips I'll go back to the cheaper alternative, tarp and bungees.  This is the first mower cover I ever bought; maybe they're all terrible and this is the best of the bunch.	-1
Overengineered. Too tailored. Won't fit my smallish 22" Toro Recycler. Useless strap at yhe back not clear what it's supposed to do. Should just drape over with enough extra to tuck under the wheels so it doesn't blow off.	-1
Very difficult to get on and off.	-1
Ripped second time off the grill after only a week.	-1
flimsy cover, I was disappointed	-1
The way this smoker is built, you can't add charcoal if the water tray is installed. Useless	-1
Works good	-1
Fits but clogs the filter instantly	-1
Go pay the $20 for a commercial grade filter from a pool store. These are junk throw away filters meant to keep you replacing them constantly.	-1
Junk! Waste of money. They bypass and allow the dirt and algae to return to the pool. Switch to a sand filter is the only solution.	-1
they sound great, but don't last long. Why can't wind chime makers use SS thread instead of twine that rots out in a year? I will re-wire this one myself to get years of service out of it.	-1
I am poor and love to garden. I cannot afford an expensive fancy greenhouse. I buy these instead. Unfortunately they have a serious design flaw. there is just too much tension caused by the metal popup hoops on the doors so that they pull at the door until the door ruptures. They know about the issue and provide belts to lessen the tension, but the belt can only do so much and by the end of the growing season, usually rots or breaks.  The company has a weird policy that you must register the greenhouse within 14 days of purchase to be covered under the warranty. A lot of people won't even open the box until after their warranty expires. I can understand not honoring the warranty after 1 year from purchase date, but forcing people to register within 14 days and not saying so on the exterior of the box, means a lot of people simply will void their warranty by not opening the box within the company's time frame.  I bought this before christmas and set it up after Christmas so my warranty is void.  I have a choice- buy bungies and try to counter the tension of the frame hoops to try to deal with their customer service to get help. If you go to their website they want you to register it first before dealing with their customer service. You cannot register it if your warranty is voided.  Poor customer service, and poorly made.	-1
We had high hopes for this pop-up tent greenhouse.  But it's made with such poor materials that it just doesn't stand up to even careful use.  The bug netting ripped in just a couple of weeks.  After a couple of months some of the zipper pulls broke and I had to attach string to them to keep theme useful.  The velcro tabs that held the door open lasted about the same amount of time.  But the real problem was that even though the tent is rated for 60 mph winds and a modest snow load, we had it collapse and break the poles during a 2" wet snow.  We threw good money after bad buying a second set of poles only to have them break too in a 30 mph wind.  Two years after we bought it, the sprung steel hoops that comprise the ends are bent by the two failures so the tent won't hold it's shape.  I've cobbled together the two half sets of poles, splinting the poles with duck tape, for one last chore (drying this season's garlic) before we throw this product away.	-1
This item appeared to be just what I needed to start my seedlings indoors.  I set it up in my basement, installed a small heater and humidifier, grow light etc.  I did this because my basement is cold and wanted to start peppers which require a hot growing area.  The order was placed through Amazon on February 10th, I received it no later than  February 13th (amazon is the greatest). THE ITEM HAS ALREADY COME APART AT THE SEAM ON THE DOOR. No heavy use here, no crazy atmospheric fluctuation, the thing is in my basement.  This is clearly a manufacturing defect- there is lots of stress on the zippers, including the door.  Figured it SHOULD be covered under warranty.  UH OH had to mail in registration card and receipt within 14 days of purchase.  MY BAD.  If I did, they would FIX it after I SHIPPED IT TO THEM!  Well, who would do that?  Lets see-- find large box. call ups, 35.00 later, and dead plants that I have been lovingly growing for 6 weeks now..... Nah, will patch with duct tape.  Im sure the rip will spread.  Save your money and get something out of glass or plexi unless you plan to use this as a "throw away" item.	-1
They disintegrated within 5 months. Could only use them the one season. Customer service was no help. I could have bought a real green house for the price I paid for these things. No way the plastic is "UV resistant"	-1
Flower House products are junk.  Not worth the $.  Easy to put together but did not last a whole season.  I used tie downs and stakes but it still ripped and the fiberglass poles broke.  Flower House customer service is  non existent.  I have e-mailed them over and over again and have never received the courtesy of a response.  You can't buy replacement poles and the warranty is useless since they never respond.  Don't waste your $.	-1
I have this filter/pump which is sold with many Intex small above ground pools. The pump lasted a year for me, then suddenly stopped working the following year. I thought it may have been some seeds from nearby trees clogging it so I took it apart. I found that the plastic covering around the shaft of the impeller had simply come off over time. A loose piece was still remaining which made it clear the now bare metal was previously covered by plastic. There was no "fixing" this. After looking on the internet for a while, the part was not available either. Now I see that many people are complaining about it suddenly stopping. This is due to that design defect and it would be tolerable if the impeller was sold at a cheap price in packs of 3 or more with instruction that it should be changed every few months. Now I have to buy another pump, but at least I just didn't wind up getting this one again.	-1
This came with my small Intex pool. It has recently died after just a few months. I am looking at the 2,500 pump which has much better reviews. UPDATE: I bought the larger unit that uses the size B filter. So much better and worth every penny.	-1
We bought an Intex 8' pool, the biggest that would fit in our new yard. I put it on a timer, since I knew from our previous in-ground pool, that pumps do not need to run all day. The first pump lasted about 2 months, started making a loud grinding noise, the impeller had broke. The lowest price I could find at the time was $40, almost as much as the $50 we spent to buy the whole pool set. The replacement pump lasted about a month, just died doesn't make any sound. I just took the pool down and stored it for the fall. The next summer, we bought a whole new Intex pool set, the pump lasted almost 3 months. You should just expect these pumps to last 1 to 3 months, be sure to have a replacement pump ON HAND when you buy the pool. Realistically, $100 a year for an above-ground pool isn't that bad, compared to several thousand to build an in-ground pool	-1
Barely works It keeps coming off of the pool side. Comes apart a lot I have to keep messing with it to keep it working.	-1
Worthless for our above ground intex pool.	-1
Waste of money. We have an inflatable side pool. This skimmer won't stay in place.	-1
returned	-1
Did not work as view on video...	-1
would never buy again	-1
The one I received don't suck the bugs and crap up , its fit's my pool very good but don't work like it should.	-1
Doesn't fit my I Tex well it is designed to fit a rounder edged pool	-1
This was a waste of money like many Intex products are now.  Save your money and invest in a good screen bug catcher.	-1
this is junk will not stay in the water	-1
WE have a 16' diameter intex and it doesn't fit over the edge in a way that allows it to stay.  The top edge of the pool is too large for the hook shaped bracket to stay secured and every time we get a little movement in the water from a breeze it comes loose.  Very frustrating!	-1
I am very disappointed with this product. We have a 16x4' Intex Ultra Frame pool, and the bracket cannot be tightened enough to stop the skimmer from popping off. When we do get it to stay on, as soon as you move around in the water, (as in swimming!) it pops off the side frame. The other day, it popped off when no one was in the pool. Glad my husband saw it. If you aren't home when this happens, it can burn up your pump. My husband said he could try attaching it to the frame with screws. But we shouldn't have to jerryrig a product to get it to work!  Intex needs to address this problem. Soon! Am returning it.	-1
whoever designed this product should be shot!  It does NOT fit the Intex Ultra Frame 14' pool!  The whole thing continues to float up in the water and air lock the pump.  You certainly can't leave in on unattended as it  will kill the pump.  I'm sure the bracket will most likely crack as the last two have after a year or so,too.  Why can't you make a product that works in your pools?	-1
Simply does not stay in place	-1
doesnt work too well, waste off money	-1
so so	-1
When working properly, the skimmer does an excellent job of pulling in debris off the top of my 16'x32' Intex Ultra Frame salt water pool. HOWEVER, as I'd feared, after just a week in use the plastic arm that the unit relies on to remain attached to the rail of the pool and thus remain firmly in place at the waterline is steadily weakening, resulting in the unit raising above the waterline and creating a vacuum whereby no water can get into the hose and into the pump. This in turn results in a low flow alarm situation for my pump, shuts it down and ultimately the solution fails. Based on this, I would NOT recommend purchasing this item. If the plastic arm were of a higher quality of plstic or made of aluminum or stainless steel then I would highly recommend it as the design is good. It's just the execution and materials that are poor.	-1
The material is too light, and the cup wants to float out of water. It did float above water and cut off water to the pump. As a result, the pump ran dry and died, and I had to replace my pump.  Now I fasten a piece of rock under the cup to prevent it from floating above water.	-1
pool skimmer mount does not fit well it keeps coming loose and tilting so that it is nor skimming just moving air and the pump loses suction the shape of the mount needs to be redesigned!	-1
Lasted about twelve months before it began to warp and fade to a gag me grey color with pock marks. Recycled it.	-1
Bottom won't stay attached.  Still, it does make a handy extra seat. The plastic seems mid - quality, so I expect it'll last a couple years, but I don't think I'd buy another.	-1
I ordered this to leave outside. The top is warped and now won't latch. I followed Directions 'to the letter' but the top had gaps on the side from day one. Now I can't get it to stay latched -less than a month! bummer	-1
Was a little disappointed product wasn't white as it advertise on the box nor does it state that the product color may come in a different color. The storage box was taupe lightly grey color . If I knew this I wouldn't have ordered it . Most of it is assembled however the top part could not align to snap in easy & is still sitting with the top cover off until I can get someone to figure out how to make it snap into place or muscle it together .	-1
You should avoid Mosquito Magnet products.  They are poorly made.  They catch a handful of mosquitos, but not enough to make a difference.  They are very expensive, and require constant add-on purchases.  Use Deet or screened porches instead.	-1
- When I first received my Magnet, it was easy to unpack and set up. I charged that battery, installed the propane and fired it up! WOW! It works! Mosquitos were flocking to it! First tank lasted a few weeks. Second propane tank installed. - What? Ran for two days then stopped. OK, instructions say "Reset" the valve/system. Done. Ran 1 day. Reset again. Ran 2 days. Well, let me pull taht tank and put it on my grill to see if the tank is bad. Grill works fine. Tank must be fine. I'll get a new tank anyway. - New tank installed. Reset system again just for good measure. Ran for 2 days. 2 more days. 1 day. Etc. - Called an acquiantance who has two of these units. He initially told me about them. Turns out, he's been haggling with the manufacturer because one of his Liberty units is doing the exact same thing!  I can't recommend or not recommend a Magnet, but I can say that when they work, there is nothing better! Mosquito problems disappear. I guess we're always trading one set of problems for another.	-1
It works great for the first season but then as all the others have said, it won't work without sending it in for expensive repairs. Don't be ripped off!	-1

Like most people, my igniter quit working, and they want a bunch of money to fix it.  That would just be good money after bad.  It never caught anything and is very expensive to run each month because you have to buy the octenol and propane.  Any other solution would work better and cost less.  Forget about this item.	-1
THIS WATER REPELLER WORK GOOD FOR A FEW MONTHS. THEN IT STARTED TO LEAK AND THERE IS NO WAY TO REPAIR IT. LEAKING GETS EXPENSIVE WHEN ITS ON 24/7. NOT WORTH THE MONEY	-1
I couldn't hate this purchase worse, it arrived with the wheels disingaged required 1 hr repair, the spinning wands are so full of friction yu get 1/2 coverage, and the hose ultimately connects to 1/16 plastic , do the math. oh yea an the shut off valve on the undercarrige constantly shuts itself off, i had a melnor for 10 years was wonderful.,this one lasted 1 month and True value packed it like garbage	-1
This is my second Raintrain.  My first broke in the same fashion and I fixed it with $5 in parts and an afternoon.  I love the concept and the functionality BUT!!  The connection to the water hose is weak, weak plastic.  Because I had seen it break at the connection before I added a quick disconnect and every time I moved the Raintrain I disconnected the hose.  Alas, this also did not work and once again after 1 season of use I have a broken connection. The unit needs to be heavy to drag the hose someone please tell the designer to put the weight in the weak points.	-1
We purchased one of these John Deere Sprinkers and two weeks before that, a LR Nelson RAINTRAIN.  After two days of use, the John Deere's gears shelled out; the RAINTRAIN is going strong after two weeks of traveling over our 2 acre lot.  We had a RAINTRAIN 20 years ago and it did fine for a long, long time.  So, I'm off to buy another RAINTRAIN.  We considered returning the poorly made Deere, but it's too much trouble.  For the record, my farmer hubby owns several BIG John Deere farm tractors and they are very reliable.  Obviously the sprinkler isn't of the same quality at all.	-1
never did work h2O2 worked short term will try insectisides next product is totally useless Why? experd product?	-1
This did not work and is very toxic to handle.	-1
Not too effective.	-1
This product does not work. I put this in the area of my yard where there always are mosquitos and after a month I still have so many mosquitos. It's better to call an exterminator for mosquito treatment than to get this product.	-1
Haven't noticed less mosquitoes since using it in my platers on the patio.	-1
Waste of money	-1
No effect	-1
I purchased this product to get rid of fungus gnats in our house plants.  Not only has it done nothing to control the gnats, the granules are now becoming moldy on the soil.	-1
I don't know why this is so popular here...  We live in Georgia and it gets really humid and hot during summer time.  Especially this year it's been really wet and mosquitoes are out of control.  We sprinkled around and in the planters and pots as we do not have any pond or water source here.  It's been several months and we do not see any progress.  Mosquitoes are still everywhere.  We also used this to kill fungus gnats in the house plants and these bits started growing mold.  Very disappointing.  Maybe if it is used in a pond or something it may work better.	-1
Not sure this works still see mosquitos	-1
I have used mosquito dunks in the past with good results ...this product turned ALL my water a nasty smelly black and killed off the plant roots.	-1
can't say as we have any less mosquitos than before,	-1
I purchased this thinking it was a safe and natural solution to solve my fungus gnats issues.  Mosquito dunks were the answer.  Yet this verso  is highly toxic. It cannot be used indoors, you should inhale any if the dust particles and you should not touch it.  There are safer non-toxic versions of the mosquitos dunks available.  Stay away from this one.  Amazon  wouldn't  even take this back. lol  This thing even has a cancer warning for CA residents.	-1
used this product for a month, and my gnats increased ONE HUNDRED fold. I stopped short of grinding them into my water, but all I notices was MOLD underneath my top dressing, and gnats EVERYwhere. would give this 0 stars if possible. used 2 full containers over a 3 week period in 12 planters. incredibly disappointing.	-1
never had good results with mosquito dunks or mosquito bits .  I tried in ditches and low areas on farm.  might be practical for a homeowner,  did not work on large scale	-1
It probably works, but reading all the warnings, it's still sitting on a high shelf, where no-one can reach it. Dumb. Should have returned it. Maybe my local nursery would like it? OR they could advise me about best usage. Disappointed,	-1
Used as instructed and really saw no discernible decrease in mosquitoes. Would not recommend and would not purchase again.	-1
I didn't see any affect to control mosquitoes away or not see in my yard,,	-1
Didn't Work At All	-1
The mosquitos still there for more than 3 weeks	-1
Have applied several times. See no improvement	-1
I'm using it, but I'm not seeing where it making much of a difference.	-1
Wrong choice for me.  I wanted to kill mosquitoes in small bits of water but this only has instructions for ponds and such.  Don't know if it works or not, afraid to put it in my outdoor aquariums, birdbaths, dog water, etc.	-1
Useless	-1
Not sure these worked.  My bride put them out.  Bugs still around.	-1
Doesn't work!!!	-1
Edit: They start to get moldy after a while. This gets rid of those little fungus gnats that swarm around moist, well fertilized, potted plants.	-1
Does nothing. Another hyped medicine man style gimmick. Did make mosquitoes happy and keep them alive and biting.	-1
Didn't seem to have any effect on my fungus gnats.  Although I know it's "mosquito" bits, the label and product info do state that it's effective for fungus gnats.  As far as I can tell, it's not.  I spread it across my entire lawn and planting beds, especially targeting wet areas with poor drainage.	-1
Hazardous to animals of all varieties.	-1
At first I thought this brush was great, but then I noticed a bunch of the wires had fallen off and were on our plates.  Apparently they just fell of the brush and stuck to the food.  Too bad we were almost done with our meal before we noticed it.  Stay away from this brush!  The other reviewers are right...the wires DO fall out.	-1
does not work	-1
made no difference whatsoever!	-1
Can't even see the instructions!	-1
Unfortunately I had a family pet recently pass away. Looking to see if this product if accidently consumed, how much would it take to poison a 110 pound dog. Half cap full spilled on floor and was lapped up by the dog. Less than 48 hours animal deceased. Looking to understand how much of this product would need to be consumed before this unwanted result could happen? Thank you, concerned animal owner?	-1
did not see ant noticeable improvement	-1
I did multiple applications to my soil with this and the fungus gnat problem never went away.  I have tried many ways to get rid of them but the best way was also the cheapest.  A 1/2" layer of sand on top of the soil did the trick in a few days.	-1
Didn't seem to work that I noticed but still trying to use it.	-1
I'll try anything to decrease the amount of mosquitoes around my house. A sprinkled this product generously as instructed, but I didn't really see any change in the mosquito population. There were still a crap load of them like always. Does this product work? Maybe, but I can't tell. It doesn't work well enough to recommend spending your hard earned money on it. I'll definitely use what I have left but don't plan on buying any more.	-1
Not what I expected.  This is to be added in sitting water.  My mistake.  I thought it was a dry type of killer feed.	-1
Read the label information before you buy.  Most of it can be found at [...] In addition, the label states to dispose of the remnants of the product through local solid waste agency.  This was not a product I felt comfortable with, so I returned it.  That said, the return process was easy.  Amazon is always provides great customer service.	-1
Very cheaply made rips and tears easy!!	-1
these take too long to heat up wood chips, just use tinfoil and poke holes in it, easier and quicker cleanup as you just toss the tinfoil packs when you are done.	-1
Doesn't last long and you can't be rough with it.  Mine had several holes in only a few months.  I finally had to get a tougher, more tarp-like cover.  But I loved how large it was and how it can be tied down.	-1
Only 2 years old, and water wicks through to the inside surface when it rains,	-1
I used this on an electric smoker and it would simply go out after about fifteen minutes. Now understand I was starting the chips with a propane torch not just waiting for the elements to heat it up. Even with an all over flame before putting the lid on all smoke stopped within fifteen minutes.  Okay, I thought I'll try drilling some holes in the bottom as the smoke box that came with my unit had holes in the bottom. So I added 6 quarter inch holes evenly across the bottom of the tray... nope. It seems like without a constant heat source it's self extinguishing.  This may work on a gas or charcoal grill but it seems un-suited for an electric smoker.	-1
Update: So, funny story. The company - Charbroil contacted me in the comments section below this review and said they would like for me to call and get this situation sorted out. I called and they had no clue what I was talking about and even claimed that the people commenting are scammers. Well, I would say that is true. Charbroil makes sub-par quality products and adds comments on negative reviews for a good image on the surface. It's all for show. Thanks for nothing.  Tore after 1 day. We were given a new BBQ pit for Christmas, so my hubby came on Amazon and bought a Char-Broil cover to match his Char-Broil grill. We hadn't even used the grill yet! This was the cheapest quality product ever! You would think that the company would provide better products with their name on it. Nope.	-1
I purchased this grill cover because of it's low cost, even though I was aware of the product's 38% 1 STAR reviews. I just assumed that if I was really, really careful, it would last. I was wrong. The combination of the cold weather and winter's wind caused the cover to rip on one side. Even though I was 8 days over Amazon's return policy, I wrote them and they refunded my money. I will be putting my refund into a higher quality product (through Amazon.com of course). Once again, Amazon.com has exceeded my expectations.	-1
cheap	-1
Box is heavy duty and works fine. However it arrived with a chunk broken on the corner. Still works but I expect that when I buy something new, it will be in new condition.	-1
I was really surprised at how poorly made this is--typical junk from China.  There are rough sharp edges and the lid barely fits on.  Will go ahead and try it, since I can't get a refund from Amazon for it being poorly made (only if it is broken or mis-advertised).  Hey Char-Broil, seriously, tell your supplier to get their act together, or better yet, find a good company in the USA that will make a good one.  Yes that would cost more.  No, I don't care--would rather pay more for a quality product.	-1
way too small (thin).  can't use chunk applewood as i planned.  only good for "chips" or "shavings" type wood for smoking on my charcoal grill	-1
DO NOT BUY! TEARS TO SHREDS ON WINDY DAY  First windy day and corners ripped open. I see it has happened to other reviewers as well. UPDATE: After another windy day, the other side in front ripped from top to bottom! UPDATE: Cheap enough at $13.15 and $13.53 (but still overpriced for the crap it is), but now IT IS OVER $20!! DO NOT BUY THIS.	-1
Did not fit my new grill that it came with as advertised. A bit not wide enough. It tore the 2nd time I put it on. I would NOT recommend this item. Cheap plastic.	-1
We've bought expensive grill covers and cheap ones, like this one. They all split in a few months, usually just after the return date. This is has a split all the way down the end. From our experience, buy as cheaply as you can so there's less remorse when they die.	-1
The recommended cover was too small.  The material is very light.  If the size works for you OK but I wouldn't expect a very long life.  I reorder the KHOMO waterproof heavy duty as a replacement I rate it five stars.  I recommend spending more and getting a superior cover.	-1
I have had this cover for about 18 months. It is falling apart, and because of this, rain gets in under the cover and sits there. I think this is actually worse for the grill than no cover at all. They really need to use better materials.	-1
Are we reviewing the same product?  The one we purchased was poorly made and tore after less than a week...  in early Spring.. living in the shade.  To Amazon's credit, they are replacing it but honestly, I'm not holding out much hope for the next one.	-1
DON'T BUY IT'S CHEAPLY MADE AND DON'T FIT THE GRILL SIZE I BOUGHT IT FOR TWO FEET TO SHORT...	-1
tore on first use	-1
Nice at first but then it ripped after two weeks, it came apart at the seams for no reason. No wind. no rough handling or anything. I went out to take it off to cook and it was ripped!	-1
I will give this a 3 for now, but I am definitely disappointed so far.  With all the generally good reviews, I thought I had received the wrong product when this cover showed up.  It is very thin and feels like I should handle it very gently to keep it from ripping.  It does fit my 65" Brinkmann grill, but it does not come anywhere close to reaching the ground, plus the velcro tabs are so short I can not get them to connect securely.  I am not even sure I would call this vinyl, as it seems like a thin coating was applied to some light weight nylon fabric.  I had previously used a 65" Brinkmann cover that was far heavier duty, longer, and had longer velcro straps...  It was great at first, but faded from black to almost white within a few months, and after just a year it started to rip at all corners.  I am skeptical that this Char-Broil one will last that long...  Will update later, but for now I am unimpressed.  EDIT - Just posted this review today at 3 stars to express my initial disappointment...  So I go to use the grill tonight - after it had rained during the day - and the whole top of the grill is wet, and the thermometer in the lid is all fogged up.  This never happened before.  There are no holes / tears in the cover - it is just soaked as if it isn't waterproof.  Still wondering if I got the right product, as this thing is junk, and is going back for a refund. Down to 1 star.	-1
Arrived with holes through vinyl.  There were two or three which looked like they were done with a box cutter by accident.  I just patched the holes and went ahead and used the product.  It's holding up with no new rips.  Just disappointed it arrived with holes in it.	-1
Planted the seeds in a large pot, covered with mesh and chicken wire, and not a single seed sprouted. Need I say more?	-1
Did not grow at all	-1
Did not grow. Planted in pete pellets I have not had any Amazon seeds grow. I get seeds at home depot and they do grow.	-1
Did not grow.	-1
They died	-1
I was not expecting these to come from China. Seeing many things online about seeds from China not being the correct seeds, I am afraid to try and grow these, and wouldn't trust it to be given to my cats. Glad I didn't spend more that $1.50, as we will not be using these. What a bummer.	-1
The seller is in Sri Lanka. Had I known that, I wouldn't have bothered ordering these seeds. They finally came a month later, and when I planted them in jiffy pots, nothing sprouted. Maybe being in transit for a month during the hottest part of the year made them go bad. Total waste of money.	-1
No good.	-1
This item is closer to 20 seeds that do sprout into catnip plants	-1
Ordered these twice. Out of 800 seeds only one germinated and then quickly died before growing more than 2 tiny leaves.	-1
Seeds are not coming up at all	-1
nothing grew	-1
The seeds are rather tiny, but I planted all of them and only about a dozen sprouted. I was pretty disappointed. The plants are also very small, but this could be the way they are. I've never seen catnip in the wild before.	-1
Did everything by instructions.  Doesn't grow at all.  Not a sign, seems all seeds are dead.  Because of insignificant price did not bother with return. Don't buy, no quality.	-1
out of 400(?) seeds.  Went to the local market and purchased a catnip plant than the cost of the seeds.	-1
I read the reviews about seeds not germinating, but I figured because I tend to be good at growing plants from seed that I wouldn't have problems.  I used good pots, proper soil with decent drainage, and now 4 weeks later I have two seedlings.  Perhaps by the end of the week I'll have another few, but certainly not even 200 (a 50% germination rate).	-1
The seeds didn't come up. We didn't see any catnip. Better off with something cheap from the store. Came in a funky little plastic bag	-1
I, too, was unable to get more than three (actually only two) seeds to grow. I planted half of the pack of seeds...but only two sprouts. That is about a 1% germination rate. I will try planting the remaining half, but at best that would be a 50% germination rate. I do not recommend this  product to anyone.	-1
Drops way to many seeds to close together. There is no consistent spacing. T he seeds run out rather then being metered.	-1
I live in a very wooded rural area and have problems with rabbits, squirrels and deer eating the plants in my yard. This stuff stinks really bad but that didn't bother the squirrels and deer. They were back munching away the next day. It seemed to work on the rabbits for a day or two then they were back too. When there is less food available I doubt it would have any effect at all on any animal. I tried using this in June so there was plenty of other food sources available. After I had purchase this I found it my local Lowes store for $19.99. So way overpriced and didn't have any effect on anything but rabbits and I think you would have to spray everyday to be effective on them.	-1
Horrible! Didn't even work! Only a few drips came out from showerhead and I have a great hose and good water flow so that wasn't the problem.	-1
