Works to teach time, the printed numbers are just slightly off which bothers the kids when they are trying to figure out the minutes. Does the Job.	1
Not that big, but works great for teaching little ones to tell time on a real clock.	1
My great grandson loves, loves this.	1
This set is so much fun!!! It comes with plenty enough to make some pretty cool sculptures but I want more because I can't stop building with it! It's meant for my 3.4 yr old but I get a kick out of it myself!	1
Love them	1
Gears are a huge hit around here. I was super excited to get another set.	1
My grandson loves to build things and this is perfect. I would purchase again.	1
Good quality clock for teaching time.	1

A useful tool for teachers and parents.	1
Just what I wanted to help my kids learn how to tell time. They love it too.	1
This was a gift for my grandson, so I can't comment about the durability or construction.  The gears come in a handy tub with handle which makes it easy for small hands to carry.  They are great bright colors.  He is 4 yrs old and I've heard has a great time constructing with the gears.  His older sis, age 8 also has fun with the gears.  I'll be looking to purchase additional gears to go with this set.	1
Manual operation, no self spinning gears or anything but a fun toy nonetheless. I love playing with these things with my 4 year old. He makes things that don't make sense except to him, and that's what it's for. He loves it	1
My grandkids love these. Great purchase!	1
My 5 year old daughter LOVES this!  She and her dad play with it for hours.  She'll be able to use this for years to come!	1
Got this for my 5 year old. but every kid who comes to our house loves this toy no matter how old they are	1
Very fun! My son looked at it and didn't think he liked it but as soon as we started playing with it and he saw how much fun and cool it was he fell in love. It's a lot of fun and so neat how they operate each other so easily. Very easy to assemble and disassemble to put away! We received it through the Amazon Stem membership which has not disappointed us yet!	1
Great for 30 minutes to an hour of play. Wish I had more shapes and could do more with it	1
I bought this last summer for my grandson, then decided he needed to be a bit older.  Just gave it to him, now that he's four.  His mother says "he's obsessed with it."  A big hit.  He's one of those kids who is fascinated by how things work, so this is perfect for him, and he now has the patience to really enjoy this.	1
This product is nice and compact. It is also very durable and easy to use. I use this with my son and he loves to take it with us when we go places. it fits nicely in my purse without taking up much room, however, it is big enough to use and manipulate without issue.	1
My toddler has this and loves it	1
Finally, I have a teaching clock where the hour hand moves when minute hand passed.	1
This is a dream for a homeschooling mom.	1
Great toy	1
I purchased this toy as a Christmas present for a 2-year old one who likes to use his hands on everything. It has helped him with his dexterity and has offered long periods of entertainment too. Mommy and baby are happy with this purchase as it engages the mind and body!	1
a very good science toys for preschoolers. The kids can play with this for a long time. great quality too!	1
Great "STEM" a'toy.  Good for kindergarten-2nd graders, as well as pre-schoolers. Teaches concept of gear action, and is a lot of fun.	1
I purchased this clock to help my daughter with telling time.  This clock is well made of thicker plastic. The hands on face are easy to move and stay in place they don't slip like some do. The numbers are bright colors and easy to read.  Great product !	1
Perfect! If you are buying for home for your kid... buy this small one not the big one.	1
Good	1
great	1
3 year old boy really enjoys these. So does mom and older sister. They are just cool to design, crank and watch turn.	1
My K class loves using these, (so did my 12 year old son).  I bought 2 sets to have plenty of pieces for a small group of children.  It took them a while to figure out how to get them all to turn at the same time, but they finally did.	1
I love these gears. The bottom base is too hard for m 4 year old to arrange. But other than that everyone loves these.	1
Those gears teach then how to assemble or create a toy.	1
Our 4 year old loves the gears! A big hit for Christmas. Our 12 year old joined in playing too. I will be looking at expansion sets for his birthday coming up.	1
Very fun. My 2.5 year old son loves playing with these.  This is a lot of gears and no batteries to worry about.  My only complaint is that the base is hard to push together, even an adult has to use some force and some of the pieces are hard to pull apart so adults are needed to help. Other than that very fun for the engineering mind.	1
such a cute clock after our lesson my daughter carried it around teaching the dog what she had learned lol she loves moving the arms around asking me what time it is and then praises me when i get it right lol by the way she has learned time too, from me teaching he lol!	1
Okay product....a little pricey for what you get and smaller than picture is posted	-1
My grandsons love this toy.	1
Nice big bucket of toys! All my kids love playing with these.	1
ok	1
Guaranteed for hours of fun and creativity.  Great for my 5 yr old grand daughter and 3 year old grand son.	1
Wonderful toy for kids to use creativity with.	1
It's a little smaller than I imagined it would be, but it does the trick of helping my son learn how to tell time.	1
Great product. Smaller than I expected.	1
great	1
My kids play with it for hours - so - it is well enjoyed in our home.	1
Very Nice.	1
The gears are great and my son loves them! I'm very happy with this purchase.	1
my son loves these!	1
Don't buy this item it's not worth it and now I'm stuck with it and I can't return it waste of money	-1
Good quality!	1
My grand kids love telling time	1
Fast shipping good product	1
My son has disappointed me by passing over his immense collection of Duplos, but he loves this. He really enjoys putting gears on a board and spinning them. As he gets older (he is 2.5), I can see him growing with this toy and building more complex structures. Part of me wishes it had more charming characters mixed in, but the little guy appears to enjoy it the way it is!	1
My kids LOVE this. They play with it daily and make all kinds of creations with it. A great multi-use toy.	1
Lots of fun!  My son loves this!	1
Keeps my 6 year old busy for hours. Great learning toy	1
Only turns clockwise, so have to go all around if past the time you want. The back leg comes off easily.	-1
The clock was okay.  It was accurately described as having the hour hand movable when the minute hand is moved.  I like the kind of student clocks which have both the big hand and the little hand loose.	1
Wanted to start learning immediately	1
clock	1
Works well since the gears are synchronized properly. Helps a child understand  proportionality. But rather over priced at over $9.50.	1
NICE TOY BUT NOT NICE TO CLEAN UP IF CHILD DOESN'T PICK IT UP	1
My kids love these. Love, love, love these. My oldest kids are 4 and 6 and have really enjoyed the variety of things they can build. Even the youngest (19 months) likes how the gears spin. They are sturdy and fit together well. My only objection is that this very large set has only one crank.	1
Fantastic always great service	1
As expected. Just rather small and the stand falls off easily. But does the job and my daughter learned from it with no problem. It's	1
My elder son has autism & is obsessed with clocks. Needless to say he LOVES this toy. An added bonus is that he can manipulate the hands.	1
How am I supposed to teach correct time when the clock hands don't point at the right time?  Only the long hand moves and the short hand supposed to move along with it.  I tried to put the hands to point 12 o'clock which at this time is the only one my 3 year old knows. But the short hand doesn't point at the 12 exactly. It's in between 12 and 1. So he gets confused whether it's 12 or 1. I returned it.	-1
Excellent toy, many different options. Hours of fun.	1
hours of fun	1
fun	1
Fun toy!  My 4 year old son was instantly interested when I showed him a tower and how one gear made the rest turn.  We had quite a few going at one time and you do have to line them up closely to be sure they all turn	1
Sturdy and fun toy!	1
"These gears make the kids think while they are building items.  Fun to see how each of them make more things turn as they build as well.  So glad I bought one for each of my grandsons!  I think they will continue using these unlike some toys that they outgrow.  Can't see that happening and also these are very well made!"  That was my original review....then we actually played with them.  I think they aren't going to be used much after seeing that my 5 yr. old grandson could care less!  Hopefully the interest will spark.  I did show him how they could be used but no interest at this point.	-1
My 18 month loves to play with these. I also have a five year old and they play this together. We first discovered them at the local library and had to have them at home. It was such a hit with all of the local kids that it was hard to give these guys a chance to play.  Perfect for kids who like to place objects into things...helps develop good problem solving skills.	1
Great learning tool.	1
Most of my students can tell time by the hour and half hour but some struggle with minutes so this clock is very useful.  It also helps with teaching elapsed time because many students can't figure out how to add and subtract time.	1
very nice, good for leaning the clock	1
Grand kids love it	1
A hit with my grandson.... He's a little young for them, but so far has enjoyed them.	1
great fun!	1
This will be helpful with teaching my granddaughter her numbers and time.	1
My daughter loves this clock to learn and tell time with.	1
A+	1
Great Item!	1
Grandson love this! It's a fantastic educational toy that we've had a great time playing with.	1
Fun	1
Arrived before estimated delivery date, just as advertised.	1
great learning toy	1
Great add on to the time teaching book. Easy to show the kids the time.	1
good	-1
A good game but as previous reviewers mentioned, gets played way more in a group setting than by a single child. For example, i thought my 4 year old son would go nuts for these gears. He owns the game since he is 2 1/2 year old. To this day I still have to be the builder for this game and he doesn't play much with it afterwards if he is by himself. The quality is very good though, sturdy plastic gears and plates that have survived being walked on and dismantled not very gently.	1
My 11-year-old daughter absolutely LOVES these things and plays with them often.  They come in a handy storage bucket with a lid for easy storage.  The pieces are very sturdy and well-made.  To date (nearly 2 years) I've had NO broken pieces.  My preschoolers enjoy these as much as my 11-year-old.  She can build with these for hours using her imagination, which I much prefer to constant video games or other types of technology.  I would definitely recommend this product!  Not cheap, but worth the money.	1
What's more important is my grandsons like it.	1
Great toy! Hours of fun!	1
very nice but my son isn't intrested :(	1
Good product	1
Great little clock - my 3 yr. old really likes it. Well made but less expensive the Judy clocks, works the same, just doesn't show the gears.	1
My kids just LOVE these!	1
good	1
Great product!	1
A big disappointment... Difficult for small hands to manipulate gears. Did not hold their attention at all because it was too frustrating. Not being used after a short time due to disinterest.	-1
Great toy for our young kids. They like to build all sorts of things with these gears.	1
Fun for kids and adults. My only complaint is that I wish these connected in a few more ways than they do. Good building/engineering toy for kids, durable pieces. Good quality.	1
Bought this for a 2 year old grandson. Now three years old, this continues to fascinate him. Plays with it frequently - great investment.	1
A phenomenal building toy! My two year old grandson loved it!	1
Happy with this purchase though i wish the stand was attached. The stand was lost many moons ago. =)	1
My 3 year old son loves this gear set. Will sit with me for hours and play with them. Loves to watch them turn on each gear. I recommend this product to anyone.	1
Seems sturdy, toy was a big hit with father and son!	1
Grandkids LOVE these!	1
Excellent ! and encourages time for you and your child	1
makes some noise when they are playing with it but they have had hours of fun with all the gears making them work in different ways	1
My kids and I love this gear set.  It keeps the mind working trying to figure out the best placement of the gears to get everything to spin in sync with one another.	1
We gave this to my nephew for his birthday and his mother has reported that it is a big hit!	1
This is what it is.  It's a big clock with hands that you can manipulate.  We love it.  It's made well, it shipped quickly, and it's served it's purpose.  If you want to work on time-telling with your kiddos, this is a great clock to meet those needs.  Inexpensive, easy to use.  Highly recommend.	1
Still figuring out things we can do with this one and my son loves it. It is very interactive and he likes it when he builds something and can make it work or move. Great entertainment for my 3 yr old and for his nana. I am not as in to this one as they are but once I get better at building I can see I will be.	1
Grandson loves it. Put together many ways - gears still turn	1
My little guy just turned 5 and got these for his birthday and we love these things. And by "we", I mean we- this is one of those toys that's fun for parents too. Figuring out how to build different set ups that can move and turn is pretty danged fun. I can see these lasting awhile, right now he's building gizmos that are pretty un-complex, but he'll be able to use these for many years and keep building gear set-ups that are more complex. Engineering, building, movement, dexterity, Gears! has it all and gets a double thumb's up from both the kid in our household and his mommy!	1
one of the block set both my 8 yr old and 3yr old play together and won't get bored. They use it to build stuff they could use in their role play game.	1
Three year old loves it. Kinda messy but worth it.	1
This is my fault, I did not read the product description well enough. It is as it says it is though :) I just wanted one bigger	1
Got my son one on his fifth birthday and within a week he was reading time all by himself. Very impressed with this toy.	1
Helped my child. The matching hands to the number really made it easy. Wish it came with the seconds too.	1
a great different way for your little builder to have some fun	1
Can't say enough about this toy.  I bought it for my son and then again a few years later for my nephew.  They both enjoy it a lot.  The base (green squares) is a little difficult for a child to take apart so they may need an adult's help in dismantling it.  The bucket that the pieces come in is very sturdy.	1
used as a present....he LOVES it	1
I noticed the numbers on all the engines so I bought this one so I could make it so my son could count the engines from 1-10.  This is number 3.  Only the coal cars are marked.  This is a large engine.  It's size makes it difficult to push around and it derails easily.  My son is 16 moths old and has trouble with this engine I recommend it if for the 2+ crowd.	1
This game is a really good one. There is no reading involved and it goes by pretty quickly so you don't have to much whining in between turns. It is really funny to watch our kids (ages 5 and 9 months) scream in glee as the pirate pops out of his barrel. Set up is a breeze. The only problem we had is that one time we played and the pirate never popped out, even though all the swords were in place. We found out that someone didn't puch the sword in all the way, this would be something you would just have to make sure was done during wach turn. Other than that, this is a cool game and takes a pretty good beating with out breaking.	1
I don't know who has more fun with this, me or my daughter.  There are endless ways to set up new constructions, and it is fun seeing her try to figure out how to get everything pieced together.  A great toy!	1
So what if we live in a digital age  kids still need to learn an analog clock, when the Revolution comes, or the Power grid wipes out, analog is all we will have LOL	1
Henry the Green Engine by Fisher-Price is a well-made toy and my grandson was very happy to add it to our growing collection of Thomas' engine friends!	1
Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway - Henry the Green Engine --- arrived on time and grandkids have been playing with all engines for more than a year and having so much fun with the whole set	1
The rating I chose was because the product was just as the seller said it was. I was very pleased with my purchase. I will buy from this seller again in the future. the product was in very good condition and my great grandson plays with it every day. He is crazy about Thomas the Train and I hope to purchase other train items soon. Thank you to my seller for such a fun product!!!!	1
My 6yr old niece loved playing with these toys. I much preferred getting her something she could build with that teaches her some basic mechanics vs another doll or movie. This pack came with more than enough parts to keep her busy for hours. Truthfully, I even joined in and found myself enjoying it.	1
Kids like putting gears together and learning how they work.	1
What is there not to love about any and all Learning Resource products? They are all amazing and they actually have children think and learn, all while having fun! Gears! Gears! Gears! have been a favorite of mine for years! I love this particular set because it is a nice bucket that gives you plenty of gears, bases and parts for hours of play! (or did I mean learning?)    Nice high quality toy - sturdy - love the self containing bucket for storage!	1
He loved them and very reasonably priced compared to other places.	1
Starting around age 2 the "World of Thomas" and his train friends became the biggest part of my son's days of play. If you are as deep into Thomas as my family is then the Sodor Bay Bridge is a must have. Hours and hours are spend pushing the toy trains over and under the bridge. Your first three starter purchases should be the trains, the tracks and then this bridge.  Good Luck it is an expensive "world" your getting into!!!	1
This is the same engine you would buy at Toys 'R Us or Target, etc.  Fits great on the wooden track set we have and is holding up to both a 4 year old's and 1 year old's playtime.	1
My nephew loved his thomas and friends toys, everyday I see him he is still playing with them. I Cant complain!!!!!!	1
Thomas and Friends trains by Learning Curve are well constructed, nice color, wheels work easily.  Grandson spends long periods of time playing with his trains.	1
Fun and great train Henery and green is my favorite color.  I am going through a craze of collecting these fun trains.	1
I got this train on sale for around $5--what a steal and my boys LOVE them!!  They even sleep with them.	1
Thomas is hard to come by, especially for a good deal.  This was a great find and an even greater deal for Christmas.	1
I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves them. He spends hours playing with it. Great product.	1
LR gears toy for Xmas gift was not a great hit.  The box is very large and lots of pieces to put together.  My wife said it would be to difficult for a child to put together so we had to return it.	1
It is good as I expected. I suggest others to buy it .	1
We have the Thomas table and most of the characters. I like the wooden ones the best but they are hard to find. Well made and will last!	1
we got this for my sons birthday and he was so excited to add it to his collection of thomas and his friends. we are always soo happy with all of our thomas train buys and amazon offers the best sellection and we love the super saver shipping option to help us save money since these trains are anything but cheap.	1
Kids loves these gears and are always playing with them.  I ordered two sets of these so they can each play with one.  They like them so much that they usually have a problem sharing them.	1
My 3 year old grandson loves this.	1
I ordered this Gears! set for my son's 5th birthday. He had played with them at his preschool so I knew he enjoyed them and has played with the set everyday at home since they arrived. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has a child who likes to create and build. This set is easy to build and modify without a parents help, which is great for independent play. In my opinion I'd say best age would be 4+.	1
These gears are rockin' gears of magically mystical wonder.  Build stuff and be in awe of th wonder they will create before your eyes.  I wish I could make a bed out of them.	1
Henry is one of the classic trains in the Thomas collection, a must have! Yes, these trains are not cheap, but they are so DURABLE and well made! I expect these trains to last for at least another generation :)	1
Amazon pricing far better than any store sale price... Inherited other Thomas and Friends wooden trains that are now 15 yrs old and still in pretty good condition.  To get all 8 original engines a pricey investment but great for hand me down toys to last a decade or more...	1
My son is really into Thomas the train and friends.  This is the wooden Henry that runs on the wooden tracks.  I've learned through trial and error about the sizes of the trains and what tracks they run on.  This train can run on both the gray tracks and the wooden tracks.  The train itself is wooden and very durable.	1
My 3rd grader is learning about time right now in school. Shes finding the story problems very difficult.  My husband and I are finding that its very hard to try to help her work through problems without some kind of visual aid. I looked to trusty Amazon to see what we could get that would be helpful. This has turned out to be the BEST learning tool weve ever purchased. Im particularly happy that turning the minute hand all the way around the clock advances the hour hand. It helps when we are working through problems.  I use it to quiz her, Ill set the time and have her tell me what time it is, or I ask her to set it to a time. Then we can work out story problems together. Like if you want to be done with your homework by 6:15 and you have 25 minutes of reading to do, 15 minutes of science and 40 minutes of math, what time do you have to start your homework? These story problems used to end in a lot of frustration on all our parts. Now she takes her little clock and sets it for the time and moves the minute hand backward (or forward depending on the problem) to help her find the answer. I see that shes more of a visual learner and this clock helped out a lot with that. So much so that she offered to pay me back for it, I of course declined, but it goes to show the value if your kiddo is struggling.  I saw that other reviewers have mentioned that the minute hand gets off sync with the hour hand. Ours hasn't had that problem, but I told my daughter to only ever move the minute hand and never try to hold the hour hand in place while moving the minute hand. It seems like it would be easy to realign them, but Im not sure and Im not willing to experiment on my perfect functioning clock. It also is a little smaller than I imagined it would be, but its perfect for little hands and the size makes it easy to store. Im very pleased that it has a removable stand, it keeps it in a good position to see when doing homework.	1
This is a very nice teaching time device.  I worked very well for me teaching my son the duration of time like from 9:45am to 11:15am.  The dots that are placed for seconds and the two color hands and the numbers for minutes are all very helpful.	1
Very good product!!!  Durable and students can manipulate to decipher how the hour and minute hand work together to tick away the time.  Very pleased.	1
Great sized tub of fun for our challenged 13 year old daughter!	1
LOVE. LOVE . LOVE. Some of the connections are hard to take apart. For this I give a pair of pliers to my child.  They are able to do it then. It is amazing what they can create and builds self esteem.  I would highly recommend for any child.	1
The kids like playing with it. But I had to tell them about pinch points. Even though it's made for kids, it's still hard on those small 7 tender fingers.	1
Out of all the toys my son has, this is the one he continues to go back to and play with. He has created many things from just the one tub. The toy is very well made. It is thick, tough plastic. All the pieces are heavy duty. I have had no issues with the gears spinning when they are supposed to. If your child is a builder, this toy is a must.	1
My children are not as enthralled as I want them to be but they like the gears and they seem to snap together and work well for them.	1
Grand son loved these gears.	1
I bought one set for my boys (age 5 & 10)  a year or so ago and they keep "running out" of pieces when they played with it.  So, i bough this one so they had enough pieces to keep their imagination going.  Great quality and the pieces fit together nicely. No complaints.	1
This toy is awesome!  Five year old plays with for long periods of time to get the gears to go.  Highly recommend.	1
I had this in my classroom and bought it for my grandchildren.  Very popular and the combinations of making it work are endless.  Great for spacial reasoning, cause/effect, forces and motion.  Besides that, it's just fun to put together and watch it move!	1
Got everything as described and promptly. THANK YOU AND WILL BUY AGAIN!!!!	1
Highly recommend this simple material for teaching children how to tell time. Children should learn to use an analog clock before they learn digital, BTW, as it more clearly illustrates the relationships between seconds, minutes, and hours.	1
daughter has this at school too.  thinks it is a great way to learn how to tell time.  would recommend it, great quality.	1
i like it, and love to play with my family. i highly recommend to purchase this for party or big groups... its fun anyway.	1
This is a great idea of a toy but it lacks something fundamental in the box.  It lacks step by step instructions on how to do different shapes.  Yesterday I sat with my nephew (4.5 years) to play with it and he wanted to do the 'helicopter' on the box.  It was painful but we did it in the end.  He was frustrated because we kept redoing things till we got it right.  A brilliant toy (highly recommended- the best toy ever) like MAGFORMERS comes with a 4-5 step on how to do a castle or a helicopter or a star or a ball. So it is great for the children to learn.  These things can't be improvised I suppose.  Today we will try to do the helicopter again so he doesn't feel intimidated with the toy as I think it is a great one.	1
My students in my class and I loved this product!	1
This is a great set for a little constructor. My 3.5 years old son loves constructing complex stuff with toys therefore to encourage him we have purchased many sets for him (legos, mega blocks, thistle blocks, quercetti tubes) Each offer different fun but this one stands out being the most mobile one.  It comes with 95 hard plastic pieces, some are to construct the base plate while another group is to carry the fun to the third dimension (the upright sticks) The rest of the pieces are colorful interdenting gears. Finally it has two handle bits which you need to move the gears round and round.  You can put the gears and sticks in various combinations (gears on the side of sticks or sticks on top of gears or gears on top of each other etc.)  After some trial and error experience with me (my son and I) we figured out the way they should be aligned to transfer a horizontal rotation to a vertical one. Then my son took over and started building interesting combinations. I am sure he will master it in time.  My experience is that the parts are a little stiff which is good for non wobbling steady rotation but bad for the little one to stick them together. So younger children may need some help  from the parents.  The price ($30) is good considering the number of pieces. Each piece comes to around 30 cents which is lower than many other construction toys. (better than quercetti and lego duplos but slightliy worse than mega blocks.) Besides the storage can is a real good advantage to store it properly after play time.  This toy set offers good fun for the little one and helps develop his/her fine motor skills as well as supporting the imagination. Yet it might be difficult to operate or master for younger children. I recommend it to anyone who is after a good toy set at a decent price...	1
Christmas gift for my 4 year old - really likes it!	1
great learning tool for young children I only wish both hands moved independently from each other it would be quicker to set different times. the blue hand has to be moved to make the red one moved-not a big deal I'm just impatient	1
it is the perfect size for my 5 yr old son to use and learn from. i would buy it all over again.	1
I got this clock for my son to help him visualize time. It is not helpful because  the hands are off.  I have it set for 4:45 and the hour hand is already past the 5. It makes it look more like 5:45, but not quite. Even at 6:00, the hour hand is pointing to the 31-32 minute, so it's already off. There is no fixing it.  You can't move the hour hand without going around the entire hour. It would be nice to just be able to push the hour( red) hand to whatever hour without winding it all the way around.	-1
Really difficult to turn. My son is really into constructing, but hasn't played with these at all.  Kind of boring, because the gears don't make anything happen, just turn each other.	-1
It works just like a regular clock, in the sense that the child has to turn the minute hand to get to the specific time requested. Perfect for homeschooling.	1
I bought it for the daughter I knew would love it.  I was surprised when all my kids did.  They don't drag them out often, but when they do they have a great time.	1
I had found a few of these pieces from a garage sale, but no box or instructions. It was placed at our youth center for grade school children. Pieces are easy to place and take off. No complicated instructions. Simple imagination is all that is required. This is a good long lasting quality toy that will have staying power.	1
These are great manipulative for the young child.  It helps in developing hand, eye coordination, can be used as math tools for counting, learning colors, sorting, and a number of educational purposes not to mention the young child's ability to create.	1
My grandkids 10, 8, 6 love the new addition to the toy room.  It was easy enough for them to do by themselves.  They loved it and so did I, just not how noisy it is when you turn the crank.  But thats all  part of kids :)	1
When given free choice of construction materials this toy was one of the favourite toys chosen by the children in  JK and Sk classes. The toy is open ended and allows the child to build and construct as he/she chooses. Turning the gears  helps children understand cause and effect of their actions and  the play and construction that ensues is limited only by their curiosity and inquisitive minds. I would recommend this toy for any young  child.	1
Our son loves these gears. Putting them together, spilling the parts all over, using the bucket as a drum, etc. he has spent hours working three parts.	1
I was looking for a fairly easy starter toy for my daughters (5 and 3) to get them interested in building and engineering. They both seem to like this and have gotten hours of fun out of it. Though my 5 year old my be ready for something a little more complex with more piece options.	1
I can't say enough about this product. It really is a toy with hours of fun and room for lots of creativity. It's one of those toys that stays with your child for years!	1
he plays with it and it is really cool you can make lots of things with it that then move.  may be too young for him he is 3 and will be 4 soon.  I have another grandson and he is 5 going on 6 and he loved it.  he winded up on christmas day playing with it more than the grandson that I bought it for.  he made all types of configurations.	1
My 4 year old loves this.  He uses it all the time.  When we have to go somewhere or if he is waiting for something he will ask me what time and have me show him on the clock.  He will then hold on to it and check for when the clock on the wall matches.	1
Needed something for my 7 year old to help her with telling time. This was a smaller version of the one they use  in class. Works wonders.	1
This is a great tool to use to tell time.  We also used this to help with the 5 multiplication tables!	1
I was a little disappointed with the 'hardness' of the gears. We had a set that was much easier for a 4 year old to use. It's great when it's mastered.	1
The idea is great and when it worked fun for young kids but when the one we had only popped up ever 4/5 games not fun	-1
Dont know why I thought this was a larger clock. But is a small hand held clock for individual children to use. Good material and look however.	1
This is a small, simply learning device that does exactly what it says- moves like a clock so you can teach kids how to tell time.	1
Just what I was looking for. It is helping the grandkids learn to tell time. It is perfect. Thanks I would buy again.	1
Cute clock.  Much smaller than I anticipated.  The back piece that holds it up is a little unstable.  Pretty small - but does the job.	1
We bought this for our 4-year-old twins (boy/girl) for Christmas and they love it.  They need a little help with it, but that's to be expected at this age.  Besides, sitting down with them is time well-spent.  It comes with 2 cranks so 2 kiddos can play at the same time.  The storage bucket is nice and sturdy too.  I wish it came with more pieces or different sized gears, but those can be purchased separately.  My son is very nosey about how things work, so this is perfect.  Great for learning!!	1
This gear set is one of my child's (and my husbands) favorite toys.  We have only had it for a month, but it seems to be pretty durable and definitely a lot of fun.  It also fosters creativity and dexterity in smaller children!  My child is two, and he is ONLY ALLOWED to play with adult help (dad helps build with him) and supervision.  It's a great set that is great fun and will be for a long while, and it should last for many years to come!	1
I bought these for my 3 year old and he loves them... My 7 year old also joined in on the fun. I love that they have their own container.	1
My Thomas the train fan loved cranky! It is made of wood, well built and has held up to a lot of us.	1
This is really neat and has held up to the time and abuse of my 3 (now 4) year old.  It's mostly wood but has some plastic parts.  We love this on this wooden track!	1
My son loves Thomas and is a huge fan! We purchased this to add to his wooden railway set. He has a few other trains as well so this piece fit in perfectly! His favorite part is turning the crank and raising things up. There are two cranks on Cranky. Like I said, one is used to raise and lower cargo and the other crank is to turn Cranky. Cranky holds up really well too! When he has been wound up all the way and my son continues to turn the crank it makes a clicking noise. I thought for sure it would break but he has held up time and time again! This is a great addition to any Thomas fan's train set! It comes with everything that is pictured (a car and a Sodor crate). The crate is made of wood as well and the car is just like any other you buy from the store.	1
My son loves this toy. It comes with a railroad car and a magnetic block that Cranky can lift. Really easy to use for little hands.	1
I order this for my 4 year old son to help him learn to tell time. I think the concept is great, but the product could be made better. I guess you get what you pay for though! Already, it seems that that hand's are a little "off".	1
It is really small, about the size of the palm of your hand. The hands do not turn independently, the only way to make the small red hand turn is by rotating the hour hand clockwise, you can't go counterclockwise either. The back has some weird plastic things sticking out that will poke your hand unless you put electrical tape over it. Certainly not worth the money.	-1
I thought it would be small, but its is size of my hand. my student loves it. its fun for them to play and learn at the same time!	1
A great addition to the train set. Easy to play with. Our little one is 2 years old and loves this!	1
Our boys love the thomas wooden set and they last so long. Cranky is no different. He still works well and the kids still enjoying using it.	1
My grandson slept with Cranky the first night.  Hours and Hours of fun play.  Will pick up any engine.  No complaints!	1
My grandson loves putting legos and tinkertoys together. So I bought him these for his 4 year old birthday.  He loves it.	1
Bought this for my grandchild enjoys it immensely. Made of good quality material probably will last for years and years	1
Excellent quality! Great for educational purposes. Keeps children involved for hours!  Great for autistic children too! A really nice learning tool.	1
I was looking for a simple clock to help teach time to my young daughter. It does exactly what it is intended to do (& the hands do move separately). I have also used this for other purposes, like a quick way to mark an early bed time or time out.	1
I would pay one buck for something like this because it reminds me of a dollar store item. The clip on the back that helps stand the clock upright is flimsy, cheap and constantly falls out. I'm going to have to glue it in with D6000. As for function - you just move the minute hand around and the hour hand will move appropriately with it. Okay that's fine but I can make a paper clock do the same thing and spend pennies. Overall not happy at all with this product. I thought it was larger and had more function (the latter my own fault for not reading more carefully). I see other reviewers have said theirs have loosened or won't tell the correct time anymore so I have that to look forward to in the near future, I'm sure. My advice - visit the dollar store, make your own or splurge for a better clock.	-1
This has been really helpful with teaching my kindergartener to tell time, and he really likes to use it.  All pieces feel very durable except for the hour & minute hands, which are okay but could be better.  This is an educational clock so it must be turned manually.  Set a time and ask the kid to tell you what it is, or have him set the time you want.  Other reviewers have commented on the stand being loose, we haven't  had this problem, it is still very secure.  Other reviewers have commented on the hands being or becoming loose and out of adjustment, we have had this problem.  I asked my kid to tell me what time it was and he had a little trouble understanding because the minute hand was slightly off.  The hour hand would not be quite at 1, for instance, but the minute hand would be a tick or two past the 12.  I took the hands off and applied some super glue to the hour hand, while holding it where it should be, this didn't interfere with it's rotation.  It's a design problem, not that it became worn out.  When you unscrew the hands you can see there is clearly just a tad too  much play with the hour hand.  Anyway, it's  good now and the kid wants to set the time every time he sees it.  For the price it's worth it to me, but it definitely could have been designed just a bit better.	1
We actually bought this for our youngest son to add to the set we already had. The first set came with the electric motor to spin the gears but not enough gears and bases to make a big project. This set worked out perfectly as an add on set.	1
My grandsone loved it.  He's all about learning how things work and he was already fascinated with gears, so this was perfect.	1
The top of the crane broke after a week of gentle use. We had to glue it. Very disappointing.  Also the magnet ball is a choking hazard for young toddlers and babies.	-1
I have ordered many 'Thomas' products from Amazon and never had a problem. Cranky was no exception. My son is very happy with it.	1
Very cute toy and easy for my almost 3 year old to operate.  I only wish it came with more magnetic crates and cars.	1
I bought these for my grandson for Christmas and he loves them. It is a fun toy but also makes your kid use their imagination.	1
Would highly recommend for young kids. My son's 4 years old and is having a blast with this toy. Definitely worth the investment. I really can't think of any dislikes on this one. Gives him lots of stimulation.	1
Got this for my grandson's 4th birthday, and it took him a little while to figure out how to use it, but he loves this and enjoys looking over and around things through the scope.  I think he'll like it more as he gets more into creative play, but he's having fun with it now!	1
We intend to use this periscope inside a toy cardboard house we built for the kids.  The plan is to bore a hole in the middle to place the periscope so they can see outside from inside the box.  Sounds fun?  Not exactly.  The view is too small.  When you look into it, you can only see an area the size of a single face in it.  They should make this wide angle view.  It is too hard to find and see anything, like looking for a tiny airplane up in the sky using a peephole. Not really worth it.  Construction is fine.  It is a piece of telescoping plastic pipe than extends to 14".  But at least it would help if it is more functional than this.	-1
Both my 4 and 6 year old can now tell time as a result of this product. My oldest actually took it into his first grade class to show his teacher and she is currently borrowing it from us while they work on their time unit. Works for me. Works for the teacher. I'm sure it will work for you as well.	1
My son loves all things Thomas - however, as his parents we haven't been impressed by all the Thomas items we've purchased in the past 2 years. thankfully we've recently switched from the plastic Trackmaster items to the wooden toys by Tomy.  This Wooden Cranky is GREAT! Nicely painted wooden toy, with some plastic pieces (face and handles). Simple winding mechanism is easy for small hands to work. Pass the included train under Cranky and a turn of the handle will wind the magnet down to pick up the cargo. Cranky's head also turns from side to side with a turn of the other handle.  Only con is that you'd have to add magnets to other pieces in order to get further use out of Cranky's cargo loader. Not an issue for us as our son picks up the trains and other magnetic toys (like Alphabet letters) with his Cranky!  A must buy for a Thomas enthusiast.	1
This was my 2 year old grandson's absolutely favorite toy at Christmas.  He simply loves it and has spent many days playing with it and talking to it.  It's well made and stands up to rough play.	1
This toy works so well with all the other Thomas Wooden toys. It is a great addition to train tracks. It makes playing with Thomas trains a lot more fun, since you can load and unload the trains. The crane also has a magnet to hold various items. Great fun.	1
We love cranky and this is such a cute crane. It is easy to use, magnet really works and cranky does move back and forth.	1
My boys love Thomas, so we got them tracks and trains. They also needed destinations. So one of the destinations we got them was Cranky The Crane.  He has moving parts, a real crane that works! Magnetic end to pick up magnetic cargo. Cranky doesn't attach to the track like other destinations, but sometimes my boys like to play with the destination with out the track anyway. So it's no big deal.  The only thing I really disliked. (Nothing to do with the actual product) was the packaging. Trying to get the dang thing out of the box required a screw driver. Then because the screws were screwed in so tight the heads got stripped and I then had to get a flat head screw driver to ply off the piece of wood that was sandwiching the card board packaging to Cranky. I then needed pliers to twist the screws out. 2 screws screwed out ok, however I did some difficulty because they were so shallow, but screwed in tight. The other two screws would NOT come out with the screwdriver.  I would say it was just the package, but no, we got the boys 2 other destinations with the same issues. This most likely won't keep you from purchasing the product, but you won't be happy with having to deal with getting it out of the package, beware, and have extra tools handy just in case the screws don't come out as easy as they should.	1
My kid is a Thomas and friends freek, he has tons of trains and now that he has Cranky he's very happy!	1
This is a fun little game for when my father was going through his pirate phase. It's easy to play for all ages and it's actually pretty exciting. It doesn't seem like it's made very well but it's not too bad overall. Sometimes we will get through putting every sword in the pirates still does not pop up, but that may be because my toddler's not putting the swords in straight. Overall it's a fun game I would recommend it to anyone that has a kid that likes Pirates.	1
There is only one place that makes it pop up, so once you know where that place is the game is no fun.  Took about three seconds to figure out.  My five year old was done with it in less than a minute.  Way over priced, you can get a better more enjoyable game.	-1
Bought for my 4 1/2 year old son for Christmas...he was very exited to see it, (who knew his old Montesori based preschool had one?...)...and LOVES it.  The gears are easy to put together, easy to turn, colorful, durable, and a child has to THINK a bit, gets to see the action as it affects the rest of the structure etc.  I'm not sure if it's going to get old...like most toys do...but so far it's still fun!	1
I like this toy.  I thought about getting the gears building table by the same company, Learning Resources, but that's about $150 once you get the gears to go with it, and this set serves the same purpose.  The only difference is that you have to build a platform with the square bases first, but that's fine with me.  This also takes up less room.  I love how open ended this toy is, but it would have gotten a full 5 stars if there were different sizes of gears in it.  I plan to purchase an additional set so we get more pieces.	1
It does what it is supposed to, and was cheap. My kids love it for "sneaking."	1
A birthday gift for my 6 year old grandson.  He is having a lot of fun with it.	1
My 6 yr old nephew loved it.	1
fun spy tool	1
My kids love the parascope. It does make items appear much smaller, but they really do enjoy looking through it to 'spy' new adventures!	1
Loved these as a child and my kids love them as well!  We bought one for our 8 and 10 year olds to share and it amuses me to see the thing poke around the corner or peek up from over a piece of furniture.  Good old fashioned spying fun!  The Alex periscope is all plastic but well made.  Looks like it will hold up nicely.  Like the bright green color. No, it does not blend it but that's great for me as a parent.  Plus, it will be harder for the kids to misplace.  Very happy with the purchase.	1
The prices for this item are all over the place in local stores and Internet, but this was the best buy by far. Couldn't be happier. Came with exceptional packaging to protect all items in box. And before extimated date. Grandson will enjoy on his Train table.	1
For the most part this toy is sturdy enough for my 3 & 4 year old boys.  The head does pop off now and then, but it is fixed easily enough.  This is a great addition to their Thomas set, they love it!	1
MY SON LOVES THOMAS.  THIS IS AN EXCELENT PRODUCT AND IT DOESNT TAKE BATTERIES WHICH IS A GOOD POINT!!!! WISH IT WOULD BE CHEAPER THOUGH	1
we got this for my sons birthday and he was so excited to add it to his collection of thomas and his friends. we are always soo happy with all of our thomas train buys and amazon offers the best sellection and we love the super saver shipping option to help us save money since these trains are anything but cheap.	1
This toy is great.  My whole family has fun every evening playing with this train.  The just can't get enough of it! Also, it's able to withstand lots of rough playing. This is a must!	1
My son has several Thomas trains, and he really likes Percy.  He has a warm smiling face, and the colors are very vivid.  The construnction is very durable, which makes for hours of fun.  The magnets are strong and enable Percy to pull several other cars.  All of the toys of the Thomas collection are excellent choices for young children. They will surely enjoy this fun toys.	1
My nephew sleeps with Percy, baths with Percy, eats with Percy...well you get the idea.  All the Thomas the Tank Engine toys are good developmentally for small children because of their colors, size, and possiblities.  The player is never limited to just one thing to do, like with normal trains.  They have personality and you learn to love them.	1
A friend had given me a small set of used Gears for my grandchildren and they had such a great time playing with them at my home, that I knew they would love to have a set at their homes. One of their favorite Christmas gifts. So much fun for the children and it lets them use their imagination! No Batteries, just fun for children from 2 to 10+!	1
I bought this set of gears for my two year old grandson for the holidays and he loves it.  It's sturdy, colorful and has endless possibilities for creative play and fine motor skills.  It keeps him busy for a very long time!	1
Our set is 7 years old and on its 5th child.  This toy has been a favorite of all my kids, boys and girls, as toddlers, preschoolers and older.  It is absorbing and lends itself to group play even better than blocks, since there are problems relating to the gears to solve that seem to override "artistic differences" that cause so many fights with block building.  My children were never so intent and cooperative playing together than with this toy.  The bucket is huge and sturdy-- like a contractor might use, seriously.  My only minor complaint is that the little pegs the gears snap on to have broken off on 4 of our pieces-- but 4 out of 150 after years of intense use is still not bad.  My advice is to definitely avoid the motorized, lighted, and theme sets-- the mechanical challenges and possibilities of this set are interesting enough, and IMO kids should have time to focus on those things without the "entertainment" level getting involved.	1
Item is as described, but broke within a few days.  Some kids are destruction teams, but mine is pretty good about not breaking toys.  This one just did not last.	-1
i thought this would be a wonderful birthday gift, but I didn't know how much everyone including the adults would like this. Everyone likes this item. So much so that I bought a second one for the family. One for the kids and one for the adults.	1
it's hard to see the world from it. Feels like looking through a tiny hole	-1
We constantly see the end of this peaking around doors, stairways, tables, etc. A lot of fun around the house, or at least I hear, I never seem to get a turn...	1
Its a cute toy.	1
This is one of my five year old grandson's favorite.	1
My son loooooves Thomas, and loves Cranky. His favorite Thomas video of all time is Creaky Cranky. So we ordered it for Christmas, and it seems durable, and he loves playing with it. HOWEVER, if you're going to give this as a present to a very excited 3 year old, TAKE IT OUT OF THE PACKAGING BEFORE YOU WRAP IT! Cranky was screwed to two pieces of wood through the cardboard. Two of the screws were stripped, and required us to snap the pieces of wood (Cranky was okay, luckily) and use a pliers to turn the screws. The entire time my son was so excited and and upset we wouldn't give him Cranky, he was jumping up and down next to me. He's a very well behaved little boy, but on Christmas morning when you're three and want to play with your new toy, even the best kid looses patience. All the other Thomas wooden pieces haven't been this much trouble to open, so we just weren't expecting it. If not for the stress this added to our Christmas morning, this would get five stars.	1
We gave this to our 3-year-old son for Christmas - not without some trepidation, given all the reviews reporting constant Cranky decapitations! However, there was no possible substitute as my son had specifically asked Santa to bring him Cranky the Crane. Not wanting to disappoint, and very confident in my husband's ability to put Cranky back together again should we have a severed head incident, I decided to take a chance with the purchase. I'm so glad that I did.  When he arrived, I took Cranky out of the box very gingerly. As I tested Cranky's levers, he seemed sturdy enough. Turn one crank, and he rotates 355 degrees in one direction. Turn it the other way, and he rotates back the other way. Turn the other crank, and it lowers and raises the magnet. I knew Cranky would be loved like the Velveteen Rabbit, if he could only survive being "loved" by my son. The true test came after Christmas morning. My son only had eyes for Cranky, sitting bravely under the Christmas tree, adorned with a big red bow and a tag with my son's name on it.  I am happy to report that our Cranky's head is still firmly attached, despite having been repeatedly knocked over by "hurricanes," bashed into by giant monster trucks and kicked/trampled by preschool and adult feet. So far we have had a combined total of 20 play hours in two-and-a half days without one guillotine incident...Cranky still lives!  True, our Cranky is still young, but for now I am giving him a clean bill of health. I will keep monitoring his health.  Update from June 2013 - our Cranky is still just fine, as good as new!	1
Wife bought this 2 years ago (son was 4 at the time), now shopping for X-mas again.  Wanted to share this with others.  We build together, and come up with crazy ideas.  Keeps him entertained, and loves taking apart and rebuilding.  Very durable large pieces.  Only issue is the cracnk handle comes off sometime...when we get it going to fast.  A great buy for the money for years.	1
This is great for boys.  Both of my grandsons (age 3+) have it and love it.	1
Our 3-yr. old daughter loves the gears. She was quite excited and overwhelmed when she opened this on Christmas morning. It didn't take her long to whip up what she later called a "rain machine". Even our 10-yr. old daughter likes watching the gears spin and is amazed at how they all interconnect.. Overall, a cool & unique building toy. We've added them to our collection along with Tinkertoys and Legos.	1
Package came torn but overall no damage to the product!	1
Works well. Kids play with it.	1
I purchased this as a birthday gift for my three-year old son who loves all things train related.  He couldn't wait to play with it as soon as he opened the box and it has continued to be one of his favorite pieces to his train set.  Three months later he still plays with it almost daily, both as part of the train track set up and just carrying it around the house.  I've been pleased with the durability.  My son plays with his toys pretty hard and I was nervous that the arm might easily break.  No problems there, though.  Cranky's head did come off once, but I was easily able to snap it back on and it's only happened once in the three months we've had the toy.  He was able to figure out how to raise and lower the magnet using the crank pretty quickly.  The magnet works well; it easily lifts the boxcar that comes with the set and can also lift the engines and other train cars he already has using their magnetic ends.  The one thing I was surprised by was that there's not a way to actually connect Cranky to the track--you just have to kind of set him next to the track layout.  Which I guess makes sense now that I think about it; I had just assumed when we ordered it that he would actually connect someway.  But its actually easier just being able to put him where you want him.  It's a nice addition for a Thomas layout.	1
My 3 year old loves playing with the magnet to see what sticks, what he can lift, and often toys need rescuing from the top of Cranky.  He's spent hours with it in the last month	1
We are happy with the purchase. The crane is good quality, sturdy, painted in nice colors (grey+green). We have not experienced the problems with head coming off (yet?). My son plays with this toy a lot with or without train set. I like that control levers (that allow to turn the head and move the magnet up and down) for this version of Cranky are manual...something to keep my son busy. I am happy that I did not buy more expensive recent automated versions of Cranky (though I have not tested them myself) . My son sometimes compares this crane to another which has a hook instead of magnet...it appears that he would prefer more realistic hook to magnet. The yellow cargo box appears the same as item recalled in 2007. When I checked the codes on the back of the blocks, the particular one that was sent to me was said not to be affected by the recall. All in all, my son likes this toy:).	1
My son has Cranky and he is happy to have him.  He is 3.  He gets frustrated when his head falls off, but I just assume that is because his little hands couldn't get it back on.  But he likes using him as part of his ensemble.	1
We've had this cranky for 5 or 6 years, and here is the deal -- expect to have to put Cranky's "head" back on once every ten minutes of play until the children are at least 6.  There is a small notch that needs to be lined up, and your kids can learn this, but they probably can't push hard enough to get the "head" to stay on until they are 6 or so.  This crane adds so much fun to the trains, though -- we have magnetized all kinds of stuff with the help of those little magnet buttons from Michael's -- you can stick them to matchbox cars and blocks and ANYthing and then use the crane to move them around.  What a blast!  Also works with hardware -- $2.00 worth of nuts and bolts becomes fun freight for the trains.	1
These are fun, but very noisy.  My nine year old just whips them together, but my 5 year old can build with them, too.  They are a fun toy, and I would buy more of them.	1
I bought this set for my 4 and 2 year old grandchildren knowing that it contained only one size gear. I had also purchased the Gizmos set that has only 82 pieces, so I thought this would expand it nicely.    Well, kids are kids and we (and I do mean we, the three of us) wound up playing with this set by itself.    What great fun! The 2 year old took to it like a duck to water and was happily building gear layouts that did nothing but turn. But she love it. Turn the crank and all the gears clattered along, amusing her no end.    The 4 year old, who has experience with these at school, was more ambitious. It turned into a race between grandson and grandpa to see who could expand our creation in the most adventurous way. By the end, we had constructed quite a machine that clattered and whirred and used up most of the pieces in the bucket.    The verdict: this set by itself is massively fun and entertaining for a 4 year old, a 2 year old and their substantially older grandfather. Having just one size of gear is not a drawback. And this set does work well with the expansion sets.    Gears! Gears! Gears! is a great concept and I can see that I will be happily expanding our collection over the months to come. I hope the kids interest in it will be as ardent as mine.  Jerry	1
Field of view is very small & excessively distorted. We can barely see anything through it.	-1
well loved gift	1
gift to grandson. I'm sure he love it.	1
My 4 year old son adores trains and among his favorites are the characters from "Thomas the Train." Percy is one of his absolute favorites.  He actually owns two of the Percy trains--one by Learning Curve, the other by Fisher Price.  This train is a typical high quality "Thomas the Train" wooden train; it can take a beating and holds up well.  My son actually inherited his Learning Curve Percy train from his 7 year old cousin, so it's about three or four years old.  After years of less than gentle treatment at the hands of two boys, the train is still in just as good condition as the newer Fisher Price Percy train, attesting to its superior quality.  Furthermore, there really isn't any discernible differences between the trains by the two companies.  As with all wooden Thomas trains, Percy is compatible with tracks, not only by Thomas, but also by Chuggington, Brio, and Circo, (the Target brand) all of which we own.	1
I ordered this as a gift and was pleases with how well it was put together. Great toy for the price!	1
I've bought others of these little trains.  They all fit very well on our Old Brio tracks and the quality is very nice.  Smooth riding wheels and very nicely painted wood.  Would recommend!	1
Both grandsons spend lots of hours playing with Thomas, Percy, James and the rest of the gang on this railroad!	1
This cute and fun toy is a must for the kids!  All the kids I know simply LOVE this toy! Also, it's able to withstand kids!	1
I recently purchased a starter train set for my son, and Thomas was included.  Along with his coaches Annie and Clarabel, Thomas has provided hours of fun for my son.  Strong in construction and exacting in detail, Thomas is an ideal toy for a young child.  I'm planning on buying more trains and tracks to expand on my son's set and I'm sure they will all be the same excellent quality as Thomas himself.  These are highly entertaining toys.  Purchase one (or several) for your children.  They will surely enjoy them.	1
My son (age 3) couldn't wait to get cranky for Christmas, and he loves it!  I have to admit that the magnet is very strong, my son can string Annie and Clarabel together and Cranky can hold them both up!  My biggest complaint is that it should be attached to a small piece of track like many of the other Thomas additions are.  When my son turns the crank, if he doesn't hold cranky down with his other hand, the whole thing topples over.  If it had a wider base and was attached to the track, then it would be sturdier.  Also, my son wants to put Cranky right next to the track!  But Cranky works best if he is about 3 inches away from the track, then the magnet falls right directly over the trains on the track and can lift magnetic cargo up, so my son gets frustrated because the magnet does not fall over the trains.  If Cranky were attached to track the way I suggest, then children would not be able to put him too close to the track.	1
After reading some questionable reviews on this product I was trepidious about purchasing it.  But gosh, what's the point of having a Thomas the train set if you can't have the island of sodor staples like cranky?!  So I took the $50 plunge.  I waited a bit before posting my own review to see if I'd have any of the problems previously mentioned.  We've had none. I must say I'm thirlled to have cranky as he's too cute and his design encourages unique motor skills by forcing my son to "work" at lifting cargo as opposed to pressing a button.  Both important factors in my book.	1
My 3 yr old grandson loves cranky.  He understood the wind up and wind down handle right away.  Great gift to go with his train set. I love the extra pieces that completed this crane.  I would purchase again in a minute.	1
Mom of 2 boys here. I'd say we could have put a down payment on a nice little bungalow for them in exchange for what we have spent on Thomas products, but hey....we need to relive our childhood. The concept of Cranky is good. Design is bad 2 cranks, 1 for up, 1 for rotation magnet will lift train cars & hotwheels cars if you kids are into that Boys like it. Good for fine motor. Amuses them for a few minutes. The problem is Cranky's head falls of if it is knocked over. I have glued his head back on 3 times with super glue (each time scrapping off the old glue to get the best hold) Head still falls off My 3 year old calls the toy "headless cranky" because I have said he can't play with him until his head dries, that he is headless I am not sure why they designed it for his head to break off. It could be  made differently without effecting use.	-1
I love this wooden Thomas series. They last for a long time and it's durable. Kids like it and play with it quite often.	1
As always, excellent Thomas and Friends product.  Grandson played with this for hours and hours on his last visit.  Woke up wanting to play trains and ended the night playing trains (lots of outdoors in-between)	1
My son is a huge Thomas and Friends fan.  This train is helping him build is wooden trainset collection.  The price was better than Toys R Us, and it didn't take long to receive it after I ordered it.  I plan on ordering more trains in the near future for him to have.	1
This is the perfect toy for a two year old...easy to grasp and play with for his tiny hands.  Very fun!	1
My son loves this also.  He loves to turn things and make them move and this is another hit from Thomas and Friends.	1
Very good!!!	1
good	1
well  loved gift	1
very nice. thank you	1
Cute game but you do have to make sure you're sticking the swords in straight because sometimes they don't register and he's still stuck in the barrel but overall it's a fun way to kill some time.  I do wish, however, that the barrel could have doubled as way to store all the swords. We have already had a couple go missing but luckily we can still play with a few less swords.	1
My grandson (5) got this toy for Christmas. It is fun to play and easy to play at his age.  He seems to like it a lot.  The price was right for this item.	1
I got this for my 2 and 4 year olds to play with the Thomas train table. It is made well, after months of play everyday I do seesome chip in paint but nothing major.	1
Grandson worn out original Percy and we needed replacement that was 'just like' the original.  Couldn't find  a wood one in stores, but this one is an exact match.	1
Cute little toy! My son loves it. I love the quality of the wood--as opposed to the plastic options. I recommend it!	1
What great 'friends' Thomas and his friends make for little people. From the toy box to the bed, to the tub...they go with my little guy everywhere. Percy is a recognized favorite and he knows them all personally by name. Should the adults mistake one for another we are quickly corrected by his accurate ability to recognize who is who. Percy is yet another of his favorites among Thomas the Train...and friends.  Highly recommend for little boys who like trains.	1
My little ones love Percy. Train is well made and I would recommend this as part of your Thomas collection.	1
Im told percy is one of the main thomas trains.  Well made and cute, like all the thomas trains.  Good purchase. M	1
I wanted to buy this engine for my son but don't want to pay "babies r us money" for it. I got exactly what I expected to get, paid less for it and my son is happy.	1
Bought this to go with wooden tracks made by a different company for Christmas for my son and he LOVES it. Fits perfectly on the tracks and he carries it everywhere!	1
My son recently got this piece for his 3rd birthday.  It's his absolute favorite piece hands down.  It can be used with any magnetic or metal cargo like the scrap cars.  I bought some extra cargo from BRIO as Thomas doesn't sell thiers separately. Cranky's head sometimes comes off so my son brings it to me and it goes right back on.  A very versatile piece too.  Because it is not connected to the track, it can go anywhere in your layout.	1
Hi,I got items,Thank you	1
Nice. Kristy-wife of Dustin	1
My 4 year old son adores trains and among his favorites are the characters from "Thomas the Train." Thomas, of course, is his absolute favorite. We have four of Thomas trains, two of which are by Learning Curve.  This train is a typical high quality "Thomas the Train" wooden train; it takes a beating and holds up well. My son actually inherited one of his Thomas trains from his six year old sister (she was a Thomas buff too, when she was younger.) After four years of less than gentle treatment at the hands of two children, that train is still in great condition. You actually can't tell it any different from the more recently purchased ones, attesting to it's superior quality.	1
I gave this Thomas train to one of my kids that I have in my daycare! He loved it as he loves trains of any kind! They are really expensive though. Bring the price down some!	1
I ordered this as a gift and was pleases with how well it was put together. Great toy for the price!	1
Love the Thomas trains!  We have a few and they are very well made. Percy is cute and should last years.	1
train seemed to be relatively heavy duty for the price I paid ($5). I gave it as a gift. Came nicely packaged.	1
I ordered several of the Thomas and Friends wooden trains to go with a Melissa and Doug wooden train track. The trains are well made and fit great on the track the magnets are supper strong and my son just absolutely loves his trains.	1
I bought Thomas and Percy for my 3 year old who loves Thomas & Friends.  I also purchased a KidKraft train table which is compatible with these wooden trains.  The train features magnets in the front and back to pull other trains or train cars.  The magnetic bond is strong enough for pulling multiple train cars, etc.  The plastic wheels are attached to metal rods which is good because I've seen some trains with plastic rods and they don't hold up as well.  My daughter takes two of these trains everywhere and they have held up to well.	1
Little Thomas and his merry band of train friends made a big hit with our little 2-year old grandson.  We have the older Brio trains and tracks from the 1990s.  These little trains work very well as they fit the tracks and the little wheels are smooth.  The train is made of wood, wheels are plastic and the quality is very nice.  Would recommend these.  They are expensive so we mix them up with the older Brio trains and he seems to like that just fine.  We've been looking at Tidmouth Shed but, boy, is that expensive and I've read that the turning mechanism is partially plastic.  I'm hoping I can rig up something with the "all wood" table I have from Brio.	1
This a not a Learning Curve toy. It is a cheaply made knockoff. Do not buy. The paint on it is poorly done.	-1
Quality product that my grandsons spend hours playing with!  Toot - toot!  Here he comes! Worth every penny. It's a great Winter pastime for them.	1
Another train, kids loved it...fits on our wooden railway. very cute. They play for hours with their trains. Kid approved.	1
Edward is an older engine who is extremely kind to everyone. He is even kind to the small engines when they get into difficulties, as well as the big engines even when they are rude or impatient.  Although Edward is the same blue color as Thomas (#1) and Gordon (#4), #2 Edward is a staple on the Island of Sodor--making it into almost every episode and Thomas the Tank Engine book.  Edward comes in two parts, held together by a strong magnet, and is very sturdy. My son has had his for years, and it still looks good as new! (Despite HOURS of playing).  Although he isn't colorful, he's a reliable fixture on the Island of Sodor.	1
I know Edward is old and my train sure is but he can still pull trains likje the big engines. His magnet is in perfect working order and he can pull a couple coaches without trouble at all. A cool thing about Edward and all the other tender engines is that little kids love to take the tender on and off. I thinks it's so funny when they do that. Edward really works well and he's capable of hours of enjoyment at a time.	1
This is a great toy that all the kids I know just love to play with!  It's always enjoyable to play with trains, especially ones with familiar faces.  Also, this toy is very durable.	1
Edward the Blue Engine is a well-built toy that can stand up to demanding play.  My son recently received Edward as a bonus item included with a Thomas video and he loves it.  The attention to detail is excellent, and the strong wooden construction will assure many hours of enjoyable play.  Edward's bright smile will also make playtime a happy time.	1
I noticed the numbers on all the engines so I bought this one so I could make it so my son could count the engines from1-10.  This is number 2.  Only the coal cars are marked.	1
Part of the train set and little ole Percy is cute and made of wood. He opens them Christmas morning so we shall see.	1
You can't have Thomas without Percy. Who else could pull the mail on time? Wooden Percy very durable and just looks better than the plastic one.	1
My six-year-old son really likes this toy.  Thomas and Friends allows for hours of imaginative and cooperative play.  Plus I appreciate the quality of the wooden construction.	1
This was purchased to accompany my son's train table.  Very well made train, bright colors....he likes it and plays with it a lot.	1
My toddler son carries this train around everywhere. He loves playing choo choo wherever he goes. It's well made, sturdy, great color, cute face for Thomas, and perfectly attracts the magnet parts of other trains to make a long choo choo train. Great fun and great product.	1
I bought 3 of these since my son kept loosing his other one and we didn't want to have to search the whole house for it.  These are just like the ones you pay the full price for and work on all the rail sets or with other cars of similar size.  Only thing I could see is maybe the blue was a little lighter than some of the other toys he has, but none of them have the exact color anyway.  Good buy and built very well.  Survived several months of cruising the carpet, being trown against concrete and shoved under the seats of the car.	1
This is a great game for little kids, no reading and it goes pretty quick. The anticipation of the pirate pooping up is half the fun! Sometimes he gets stuck and doesn't pop up but at least it keeps everyone on the edge of their seat!	1
I purchased this game for my four-year-old son. He absolutely loves it and it is now his favorite game. My 2 1/2 year-old also loves it and is able to play as well. Its fun for the whole family.	1
I only really wanted the Coal Car.  It is too bad they do not make an "Edward" in a battery operated unit.	1
My son is a huge Thomas and Friends fan.  This train is helping him build is wooden trainset collection.  The price was better than Toys R Us, and it didn't take long to receive it after I ordered it.  I plan on ordering more trains in the near future for him to have.	1
My son can't get enough of trains right now so this was a perfect choice.  Good quality and I got it for only $7 which is significantly less than the local toy store.	1
My grandson was thrilled to find Edward on the train table when he arrived one morning. The quality of these pieces and the detail is exceptional.	1
This is the same engine you would buy at Toys 'R Us or Target, etc.  Fits great on the wooden track set we have and is holding up to both a 4 year old's and 1 year old's playtime.	1
My nephew loved his thomas and friends toys, everyday I see him he is still playing with them. I Cant complain !!!!!!	1
Let me tell you that I have parties all the time.  All of my friends are over the age of 25 years old and when we get together we break out the Thomas and Friends choo choo train.  There is nothing more fun than playing with a blue train especially after drinking a few Yoo Hoos.  Our parties get pretty crazy.  Seriously, this toy is of nice build and quality.  Our nephew loved it.  Well made and perfect size for a 2 year old.	1
Good detail and quality for something that small.  Has difficulty clearing the underpasses and bridges on the train table. Our grandson loved this piece the most!	1
My son has been wanting a Wooden Railway Thomas forever, so I finally ordered one. Do not buy the $10 one sold by NonStop Group. It came straight from China (didn't think that was a big deal--after all, they're all made in China anyway, I figured, and it was the only Wooden Railway Thomas available on Amazon when I was looking). The product was a joke: It was dirty, dented, cracked, had faded paint, and came in cheap packaging. Some kind of fake or something? Needless to say, this is going back. I am astounded that Amazon would even do business with a company that sells this garbage.	-1
My son just loves thomas, so when his train broke we had to find him a new one. Found this one on line and it was exactly like his other one. Ordered it and it arrived on time.	1
The whole Thomas crew is loved by children.  Percy is a must to be with his best friend Thomas.  We just appreciate the quality of these items.  They look just like the cartoon & the children just love them all.  They love to put their magnets together & reinact the shows they watch.  Percy & Thomas are best friends so if you give Thomas have Percy given either with or close behind.	1
Percy is cool engine. My son really wanted Percy. All Thomas & Friends engines that I have seen so far are very delicately (maybe elegantly?) crafted (but sturdy and durable)...they have slightly smaller bases and don't feel as massive as Imaginarium's locomotive/wagons...also they have better quality wheels that keep them on tracks well.	1
The kids love this train, plus the Thomas train I got with it. They have little magnet bits on the ends so the trains can stick together. The trains themselves were a little smaller than I expected, but the kids don't seem to mind, although they keep getting lost because they are so small. The toy is colorful, well-built, and the kids love it.	1
You can't go wrong with Percy.  This basic Percy is great, and if you have not bought a set that includes Percy, Amazon's price cannot be beat. However, if you are at all considering buying a set, make sure and check if there is one with Percy available. We now have multiple Percy trains that have come with sets.  While Thomas comes with just about every set, Percy is also included in several.	1
I noticed the numbers on all the engines so I bought this one so I could make it so my son could count the engines from1-10.  This is number 4.  Only the coal cars are marked.  This is a large engine.  It's size makes it difficult to push around and it derails easily.  My son is 16 moths old and has trouble with this engine I recommend it if for the 2+ crowd.	1
Grandkids enjoyed	1
Its fun. We saw it in a cartoon and got it. Nothing amazing.	1
Ordered this train while it was on sale. It's just like most of the other Thomas and Friends wooden trains. They hold up well and are great to play with.	1
We got this train when it was on sale for around $5, my boys love it  and have had fun since we got it.	1
We have the Thomas table and most of the characters. I like the wooden ones the best but they are hard to find. Well made and will last!	1
Great price, fast delivery. Grandchildren requested it to go with other Thomas products and loved it when they opened it for Christmas.	1
I purchased an Imaginarium train set for my son for Christmas and these work very well with it. They seem very durable and he's having a ball with it.	1
Love Thomas trains. We have an off brand track...Carl the Conductor. Our son loves his trains they work great on our tracks.	1
How can you have a Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway without Thomas the Tank Engine? My grandson got a Wooden Railway set second hand. There was no Thomas. Now there is!	1
This wooden Thomas the train car is a great piece for any child who loves train and Thomas the train in general. It is a classic toy that will be loved.	1
Got this for my son for Christmas to go with some wooden tracks not made by Thomas and Friends. It works great! My son plays with it every day!	1
Super fun! Easy game to even play with under 3 just pick a sword and try (no teams, no matter what color).  The pirate scares me each time! Ha ha ha.	1
I was looking for a simple easy game to play with my young nieces and this was perfect...  easy to set up and fun to play for all ages	1
Such a cute game, and great for little kids with a shorter attention span.  Everyone from the  3 year old to the 43 year old in our family enjoys playing pop up pirate!	1
My grandson carries this little train with him everywhere.  It appears to be durable and just the right size for little ones.	1
How can you have Thomas and not Percy!?!  With his infectious grin, gentle nature, and cheerful green color Percy has nearly as many adventures as Thomas.  [It is not that  Percy has an adventurous spirit.  Percy is happy just shuttling cars in the Yard.  It's just that adventure just seems to find him.]  He gets covered with dirt, coal dust, rocks (in a landslide), and delectable chocolate (my favorite story--lol).  He also has run-ins with Chinese Dragons, Jack Frost, Dirty Diesels, and troublesome trucks, etc.  Five Stars.  For the Thomas crowd I would think Percy would be a necessity because he is at the center of many an adventure.  Certainly he is my own son's second favorite Steamie.  Typical sturdy construction.  Percy is a nearly always a happy little Steamie that is lots of fun to play with.	1
Most of my trains are pretty old except for the new ones but Percy really hasn't had any scratches and i've had him for nine years. His magnet is still there and it's in working order. Percy is one of everyone's favorite engines and this one is a great buy!	1
My 3 year-old loves all things Thomas, and we were thrilled when we found this Gordon! Excellent quality, as expected from Thomas and Friends.	1
I could send my kids to college with the amount of money I've spend on these pieces of wood and plastic. Seriously how much does it cost to make one of these? 50 cents in wood and plastic? They turn around and sell them for 20.00+ in stores. (Amazon is slightly more reasonable)  From a parent's perspective DON'T let your kids get addicted to Thomas and Friends unless you're well off.  I gave it 5 stars thou because my kid goes GAGA over these things.. C'est la vie	1
My son loves say that Gordon is "biiiiiiiiig" and, of course, he loves that Gordon gets to pull his tender around. Great addition to our collection of trains - sturdy and holds up well to tough play, bath time, bed time...	1
My son loves Thomas the Tank Engine. The trains are well made and he loves to play with them. The product arrived before it was due, which made my son very happy.	1
My son is a huge Thomas and Friends fan.  This train is helping him build is wooden trainset collection.  The price was better than Toys R Us, and it didn't take long to receive it after I ordered it.  I plan on ordering more trains in the near future for him to have.	1
I have much higher expectation of this price. However, the quality is bad.	-1
kids had fun with this game.	1
My kids and I enjoy playing this game together	1
This is a great purchase for a two year old who love Thomas and/or trains of any kind. It is good quality and lots of fun!	1
good toy.  sturdy and durable.  the trains fit together very well and the musical car works very well. good purchase	1
My son loves playing with his Thomas the Tank Engine toy.  The toy arrived in excellent condition and on time.  I love the magnet feature.	1
we got this for my sons birthday and he was so excited to add it to his collection of thomas and his friends. we are always soo happy with all of our thomas train buys and amazon offers the best sellection and we love the super saver shipping option to help us save money since these trains are anything but cheap.	1
I get all of my son's Thomas toys on Amazon. They are the same quality as the big Toy stores for a fraction of the price. Gordon came well packaged, arrived quickly and is played with daily in our house. Hours of imaginative play have come from this purchase and my son and I couldn't be happier.	1
Great product!  Durable--from the tub, to the bed, to the toybox and more.  The grands love it.  A real favorite and the delight of any grandmother having given a gift and seeing her little guy enjoy!	1
This is the same engine you would buy at Toys 'R Us or Target, etc.  Fits great on the wooden track set we have and is holding up to both a 4 year old's and 1 year old's playtime.	1
Had to have this one because he is know as the strongest engine and also because I have a son named Gordon!	1
Thomas is hard to come by, especially for a good deal.  This was a great find and an even greater deal for Christmas.	1
Cheaply made.  Head doesn't pop up after all swords are inserted. Frustrated 3 yr old.  "Grandma is doesn't work I'm confused" junk!	-1
Fun	1
I bought Thomas and Percy for my 3 year old who loves Thomas & Friends.  I also purchased a KidKraft train table which is compatible with these wooden trains.  The train features magnets in the front and back to pull other trains or train cars.  The magnetic bond is strong enough for pulling multiple train cars, etc.  The plastic wheels are attached to metal rods which is good because I've seen some trains with plastic rods and they don't hold up as well.  My daughter takes two of these trains everywhere and they have held up to well.	1
son bellos muy duraderos y resistentes a mi hijo le encanta juega mucho con el durante el dia me encanta	1
There's no complete train set without Thomas, and he was one of a few trains my son received at once. He actually had never watched the show, read a book, or anything and Thomas for a second took a back seat to a cheaper, more realistic looking train. But it didn't take long for my son to start recognizing Thomas' face everywhere we went. After a little while, Thomas became the favorite, and we started watching the show, reading the books, and of course, buying his little Sodor companions and accessories. I love that my son gets so much enjoyment from this character, but be forewarned, once you open this (sometimes) pricey can of worms, there's no turning back! I'm just glad to know that because of the quality, even though my son bangs and drops these often, they'll still probably be able to be used by his kids. The only worry I have is with the paint, as it has worn off minorly in some areas, but I truly think you can't get any higher quality. Even the fluidity with which it rolls on the tracks is MUCH better than some cheap supplementary trains I've purchased. I'm pretty happy with this and the other figures.	1
This was a birthday wish item for my niece and the squeals when she opened it were a clue that it was a hit. She is loving playing with trains in general and Thomas in specific.  The train seems to be good quality manufacturing and durable enough to stand up to a 2 year old's abuse.  Would buy again!	1
Gordon is on many Thomas episodes and is important enough to be in the theme song ("Gordon thunders down the line"), so he is a must for any Thomas wooden railway set!	1
I usually write descriptive reviews but i bought this for other peoples kids, so i can't add any real value other than it looks like the picture and I assume they like it.	1
we got this for my sons birthday and he was so excited to add it to his collection of thomas and his friends. we are always soo happy with all of our thomas train buys and amazon offers the best sellection and we love the super saver shipping option to help us save money since these trains are anything but cheap.	1
I can't believe I waited so long to get Gordon for my son. No Thomas collection is respectable without him. The big blue engine has been a great addition. The quality of these wooden toys is the best. Unfortunately, they don't stay gorgeous forever, especially with the way my 3-year-old plays with them constantly. Oh well ... every paint chip proves how much he loves to play with him!	1
Fun to play with a 4 year old, but would definitely be easier if it was bolted down or had a base to hold on to.  Pirate pops right out of the barrel and flys into the air...fun!	1
Grandkid loves it.	1
This is a very nice addition to any Thomas Wooden Railway collection. I purchased this for my son and he really enjoys it. It is durable and very detailed, just like the other Thomas Wooden items. If your child is a Thomas fan, this would be perfect for him=)	1
My 3 year old loves this and my 2 year old can even play along. Great family game.	1
Cute game, my 3 y/o loves pirates and this helps with learning to take turns!	1
It was what I expected and it came in time for my grandsons birthday	1
If your child enjoys acting out the Thomas & Friends episodes, Gordon is one of the main characters. He is the senior member of the engine team, and his job is to pull the express full of important people around. Gordon can be boastful sometimes, and he wishes he could only pull coaches and NEVER pull freight cars, but he will use his strength to help Thomas and the other engines out of a jam.  You might want to get Gordon for the fact that he's an express engine, but I would also recommend getting him because he can help the other engines whenever they get into a jam.	1
When my sister plays express with Gordon and all the coaches she sometimes has a hard time pulling them. Then when I help her I realize how many coaches Gordon can pull. It amazes me how strong gordon really is. Like all Thomas trains the magnet is very durable and it can be used for hours of use.	1
This huge toy is loved by many; you can roll it around, make a train, play games, and lots of other stuff with it. Also, it is very durable. This toy is great!	1
Gordon is the large express engine.  He's bigger than the other Thomas the Tank Engine toys.  His bright blue paint and smiling face make him a joy to play with.  My son just recently got Gordon, and he has quickly become one of his favorites.  He likes to attach all of his other cars to Gordon and have him pull them.  As with other trains in this family, Gordon is strong and durable and will provide hours of fun, interactive play.  Pick Gordon up today for your child; they will thank you for it.	1
Be sure to get the TOMY version of Pop Up Pirate and not one of the knock off versions (see my pic for the differences). My 6 and 7 year olds enjoy this game.	1
Super simple game but that was the point. My almost 5 year old is currently obsessed with games and this fit the bill. It took him no time to learn how to play.	1
One of our favorite games. It's quick and simple and great when you have a group that spans across the ages.	1
Thomas is ranked high for a reason.  Children love him.  If your children enjoy Thomas you should definitely buy this for them.  Very cute & a perfect size to carry around.  UPDATE:  I thought it was important to note that only after a week of having Thomas the paint on the top corners have worn off.  There hasn't been any rough play so definitely wasn't very happy about that.  Just wanted to provide the feedback.  Percy hasn't done this yet....fingers crossed he doesn't.	1
After some research and purchases (of wooden trains and train set components from other companies) I have to conclude that Thomas and Friends collections is of best quality and most fun ...maybe because of the faces on the engines and associated stories/characters...maybe because of bright shiny colors...maybe because many different engines are available...maybe because the track components are most developed and fun (many different cranes, many different types of tunnels etc...ps. we don't have any of those)...as always I was surprised that these nice toys that many American kids love are made in China, and not USA. The sad thing is that even if I wanted to buy product made in USA (...or Europe...let's say wooden train set or wooden engines)there are very few comparable choices. All that being said, my son loves his little Thomas train and we are getting few more friends for his Thomas.	1
Because my son is obsessed with Thomas the Train and all of his friends, this toy is like another child in our home.  We have many of the wooden magnet Thomas the trains and they are the perfect toy.  Very durable, happy faces, and provide entertainment for hours and probably years.  It's why we keep buying more to add to our collection.	1
The kids love this train, plus the Percy train I got with it. They have little magnet bits on the ends so the trains can stick together. The trains themselves were a little smaller than I expected, but the kids don't seem to mind, although they keep getting lost because they are so small. The toy is colorful, well-built, and the kids love it.	1
You can't go wrong with Thomas Wooden Railway toys.  It's durable, cute, and literally hours of fun if your kid is into trains.  I love purchasing them on Amazon because otherwise I'd go broke.  They come promptly, are in good condition/packaging, and will last forever.  You simply can't beat it!	1
Christmas present for grandson, but looks like he'll like the popping up of pirate, while working on hand coordination	1
my 3 yoa grandson loves it ,	1
Really fun! Love it when it pops!	1
My 3 year old is loving this!!	1
I work with a group of girls ages 8-11.  I bring this game for gathering time, or extra time leftover.  They love it.  Not as interesting to the girls that are almost 12, but everyone else asks for it constantly.	1
This game has provided hours and hours of fun.  I recently got it out for a family gathering and all the kids were mesmerized.  It was a great purchase.	1
I didn't buy this for my nephew to enhance his intellect... I bought it for his new train set.  He loves it, it's durable and I am happy.	1
Spence checks his pockets before going anywhere to make sure his trian is there.  It makes a great quiet time toy for church, doctor visits and shopping entertainment.  Will buy many more of this quality toy.	1
Our family loves it	1
Grandkids enjoy this game and it's easy for even the little ones to play.  Hard to find games that all ages can play together and the older ones don't get bored.	1
A must have with your Thomas collection. Easy to hook up with other trains and very durable.	1
Thomas the Tank Engine IS my young son's favorite toy. Actually Thomas is just the beginning. When you start adding on other vehicles and buildings, you'll soon have a little railroad empire going. The price is up there a bit, but when a kid loves it like mine does, in the long run it is worth it. We got Thomas for him when he was two. He is now four and still going strong. Thomas will be a keepsake for our child's heritage book long after he has outgrown it.	1
Thomas is great and it's so fun to pull him along the track woth Annie and Clarabel. When I make the big setes In set aside a branch line for Thomas, Percy, and sometimes Lady. Thomas is great but in order to get the experience you need Annie and Clarabel.	1
Bought this as pass time toy for toddler. Very cool toy because it has lots of swords, so takes more time to put them in to satisfy their need to do repetitive stuff.	1
great quick game with sturdy pieces. Good buy	1
Love how cute this game is! The price point is just right and it allows for a quick play that is different each time.	1
There isn't much to this game (not a surprise, but I thought the pirate theme would appeal), so my 4-year-old grandson rarely asks to play; however, he does enjoy it when we play. I'm guessing that the game would appeal more to children under 4, especially because game choices are more limited for 2- and 3-year-olds.	1
My 4 year old quickly lost interest.  The pirate doesn't pop up that far and sometimes the mechanism doesn't work.  Hard to play for longer than 5 minutes.	-1
Kids love this game.  It strengthens fine motor skills as children might have to work just a bit harder on pushing the pieces in.	1
grandkids love it	1
I would have returned it but my grandson had already seen it.  I think it's dangerous as the pirate head FLIES off when sprung and twice it has hit people. This would have been great had the head not come completely off. I would not buy this product.	-1
This is really fun to play although it is hard to figure out whether your pirate will pop up when you put the swords in or out. I don't think that we've been able to figure that out just yet but it is fun when the pirate pops up and scares everyone.  I think this would be a fun game for a pirate themed party or under the sea party.	1
My kids (3 and 5) love it and can play it independently.  Will use as a game for group speech therapy.	1
One of  the best games ever	1
My family loves it. My two year old to the teenagers all play it. Sometimes we use it to decide who has to do the dishes.	1
Not worth this much money	-1
One of my absolute favorites for the students I work with. I work with students with various disabilities and this one never disappoints. The kids are always eager to see which sword will cause the pirate to pop up! I up the ante by saying whoever catches the pirate when he pops up wins! It has stopped some of them from shying away or becoming anxious at the thought of the pirate popping up. Great game for school age kiddos.	1
This is one of my son's favorite games. He's 3 years old. Its a quick game that can play several times.	1
Great fun. The swords have to be put in a certain way or else it won't pop.	1
Grand-children love this	1
This toy worked well first few times we played and held my kids attention but now pirate will not pop up.	-1
Cute game, the 2 & 4 yr old really enjoy playing it.	1
NICE GAME	1
Probably the best game for the whole family of four. My two year old has fun playing this and so does my husband.	1
Great for speech and Language therapy.	1
Product was as described and arrived on time.	1
too fun and my hubby and i jump every time the pirate does. lol.	1
Works pretty well ... actually kind of scared the heck out of me when I stuck the sword in and it popped out. That thing launches!	1
Dumb game, the same sword does it each time and my 6 year old figured it out. Not good for small kids as you have to push the swords in perfectly straight	-1
great game	1
Love it. Received quickly and as described. Kids had a great time playing with it.	1
Great game! We wanted something that was simple to play and difficult to crash (pieces to board games are often scattered when our little one wants to "play" and bumps the board). This one fit the bill perfectly. Fun, easy game of chance.	1
Fun and easy game to play with my 3 year old.	1
Fun toy! Decently made but it's a little tricky for young kids to get the swords in and engage the pop up as they should. It popped up as it was supposed to about 80% of the time but if the sword went in too soft sometimes we finished a game with no pop up. Game goes quickly so that's nice. I think it was worth the money.	1
This game is very easy for kids to learn how to play and to understand. It's an easy and fun game to play with the little ones.	1
kids love this game!	1
Bought this for my 6 year old after the game was depicted in an episode of his favorite cartoon, "Larva." His reaction to seeing this in person was worth way more than $15! The game is pretty fun to play together as a family too, simple and silly but fun.	1
My 5 year old and 3 year old love playing this game.  It is super simple but really fun.  Even mom and dad have fun playing with them.	1
loved it	1
TOMY  Pop Up Pirate Game is a great game. My 5 year old son & nephew love this. The functions work well, stick the sword in and eventually the little pirate pops out.  I bought this for son as a gift. He used to play this during speech-language therapy as a 2-3 year old enjoyed it. So, I bought it for him 2 years later, and he still enjoys playing it at home.  ALSO, this is my favorite part.... NO BATTERIES! It is a 100% cause & effect game.	1
Better than we expected, the kids loved it! No batteries needed and lots of fun play!	1
I haven't had the chance to play this game with my three and four-year-old grandsons who were the recipients of this gift. Their mom reports however, that the boys get a big kick out of it, and play it frequently.  I liked this game because it didn't involve lots of rules, or need cards or dice. Note some of the other reviews that indicate how to make sure the pirate pops out is triggered by more than one sword spot. If I hadn't read their other reviews, I would not have purchased this item.	1
Pirate pops when we are putting swords in but not when pulling them out.	-1
Very fun game for the whole family, very simple, no batteries needed, my son love popping games, anyone from 2-102 can easily play it, then POP!!	1
Simple fun game for all ages!	1
Great product that the whole family enjoys, especially my 5 year old son!	1
If you, like me, are looking for games to play with a high energy, lack of focus little boy, then this is the game for you. For my four year old, games with a lot of rules and that require skills he's still learning with clear winners and losers are not the best choice games for us.  He doesn't have the patience, skill, or temperament.  I needed games to slowly introduce him into those skills and Pop Up Pirate is that game!  The only rule, everyone takes turns to place a sword into a slot.  The person who makes the pirate pop-up out of the barrel wins.  We don't play winner/loser, but you can if you choose to do so.  The game comes with 20 swords, four colors with five each, a barrel, and said pirate.  It's for 2 to 4 players, my son and I just pick up a sword no matter the color, but if you have more kids or players, then you can choose colors.  You stick the pirate in the barrel where there is a trap/spring mechanism that is only triggered when someone sticks a sword in the right slot.  Each player takes a color and everyone takes turns sticking a sword into a slot. When the right sword pokes the pirate, he pops high up into the air.  The pirate is fairly light weight so if he were to really go flying he would not break anything or hurt anyone.  The pirate jumps at most 2 feet into the air, probably less.  The only caveat is to make kids aren't sticking their face near the barrel with the pirate in the hole for obvious reasons. This game comes in fairly big box as the barrel is about as wide as a clothes iron, but not nearly as tall.  If you need a game for toddlers/preschoolers that is guaranteed to teach taking turns and highly giggle inducing, then Pop up Pirate is your game!	1
Good	1
Awesome game!	1
This is a Christmas present. But I got it out and tested it. It works great. Pirate pops out at different times and triggered by different slots. My son is a pirate enthusiast. He is going to LOVE this.	1
Original game and not a cheap knock off like some people have been succeeded into buying!!	1
My 6 year old loves this!	1
Didn't work as advertised.  Could not push down pirate.  Contacted seller.  Seller said faulty product wasn't their problem.	-1
My kids love this game! It never fails to surprise us. It's great because it doesn't require any batteries.	1
Game doesn't work properly.  You can insert all the swords and the pirate does not "pop" out.  Disappointing.	-1
Cute, fun, easy game. The game actually fit back in the box easily! I really appreciate that.	1
I had this toy as a kid (30 years ago) and had to buy it for my son. It's exactly the same as the one I had. The hole switches each time, you just have to turn the pirate around. Fun for as young as 3 I believe.	1
This is a fun little toy.  Startles me every time he pops out.  He really goes flying.  My four year old doesn't quite get the concept.  He just stabs the barrel with the same sword in different holes until he pops.	1
Worth a few extra bucks to get the real deal.  My 3 year old loves it!  This is larger and much sturdier than the cheaper knock-offs.	1
Easy to explain and exciting for a 3 year old. My daughter and I always have fun playing with it.	1
Amazing toy that teaches kids how to take turns.  I love it.  A little difficult to push the swords in but you must teach the kids how to do it.	1
great toy, a hit:)	1
My son really loves this game.  It is fun for a few minutes with the whole family.	1
This was a hit with my 7 & 3yr old boys. Swords are not flimsy and it's exciting who will pop the pirate!	1
The Thomas train and train collections are durable toys. Their real value, though, is that playing with the toys allows children to act out the great Thomas and Friends children's stories they read and watch. Kids' imaginations can remarkably supply buildings and water towers and cranes, etc., so that they won't even miss what might be lacking from less expensive sets. And families can build some of these items themselves out of old boxes, etc.  BUT I HAVE YET TO MEET KIDS THAT LOVE THOMAS THAT DIDN'T WANT A ROUNDHOUSE. This is the 'official' Thomas roundhouse, but it is very expensive. YOU PROBABLY CAN FIND A GENERIC ROUNDHOUSE FOR A LOT LESS (MAYBE EVEN 2/3 LESS!) WITH A LITTLE LOOKING. Purchasing recommendation: * Choose which type of Thomas trains you will 'standardize' on. There are three kinds: This size of wooden trains from Learning Curve; larger, plastic, battery-operated trains from Tomy; and smaller, die-cast metal trains from Ertl. The wooden trains have the most products and accessories available. * The clickety-clack (grooved to look like real railroad) track in the Thomas series is great, but it's expensive; I recommend buying generic track. ... You can literally save hundreds of dollars by buying these kinds of sets. * Buy the Thomas and friends engines separately--and wait for sales. The kids care about the characters, so no short-cutting (ie., Brio or generic trains) here. * Look for trains bundled with VHS videos. You can get a video and a train (on sale) for about the same price as a train alone. * Only buy the official accessories (buildings, tables, etc.) if you cannot find generic substitutes for less or cannot make them yourself.	1
My kids absolutely love playing with this, and we had no issues with missing parts.  The biggest issue with it is the cost.  Face it, it's a lot of money.  However, if your kids are beginning to get into Thomas, then you're better off buying this than buying more and more of the trains.  You can easily spend the same buying four or five of the lesser known trains, but I think that your children will have more fun with this. I also looked at the Roundhouse by Brio.  The Learning Curve Roundhose is less expensive and it is very solid.  The Brio Roundhouse has doors at the back of the Roundhose whereas this is open.  My children don't mind one bit that it is open in the back.	1
I was surprised how little my kids ages 6,3, and 1 played with this. It mostly just gets plastic swords all over my house. One huge downside is that you can just reach over and pull the pirate out at any point in the game. It's hard to keep the little hands away from the pirate and to get them to push the swords in far enough to pop him out if it is the right slot. I don't recommend.	-1
Bought this for a pirate loving 5 year old.  He loves it and no batteries required!  Good old fashioned fun!	1
First off, let me start by saying I bought this roundhouse with the turntable for VERY little on Ebay. I saw how much it was in stores and online, so I waited it out with bidding. My son likes this roundhouse pretty well, but I found the one that makes sounds for really cheap locally and decided to get that one for him, he likes it even more, so if you have the money, the sights and sounds roundhouse is the way to go. Either way, they are both very well made as with all Thomas wooden railway items and you won't be disappointed.	1
If your child likes playing with Thomas & Friends trains, the Roundhouse is where the engines can rest after a long day of work. This has 5 sheds that can store small engines like Thomas and Percy, and even large engines like Gordon and James. It can simply be used with the Round-about Turntable (sold separately) or the 5-way switch track (included). This bulding is a little more expensive than others, but it will be worth the money because your child will be able to have a place for housing the Thomas engines.	1
The Thomas train sets are great modern versions of the classic indestructible wooden train sets.  Simple enough to avoid the toddler age frustrations of getting the cars to run on the track yet complex enough to engage a wide range of ages (up to and including Grandpas).  All the stories help with the imagination part....the books & videos provide an endless source of adventures that can be acted out, although most kids are perfectly capable of inventing their own episodes.  Here is my advice, if you are trying to work your way through the maze of start-up options:  First of all, you can spend a fortune on a huge set....even if you can afford it, I would start with something small and give the child the joy of receiving a chain of small but intriguing presents over a long period of time.  It fosters the joy of giving/receiving and helps teach them to come back again and again to the same toy...watching it grow, asking for specific items from the stories they hear, etc.  Several reviewers suggest painting an old coffee table and this is a great idea.  I suggest the Figure 8 set (the most popular one) or if you want to spend a little bit more, the Conductors Figure 8 set.  Both are complex enough to be interesting, but simple enough to give lots of room for growth.  Almost immediately I would add a new present of one of the inexpensive engines (you can ask the child which story they like best and get that engine for them....or buy the engine to go with the video or book in the same gift)....these would be Percy The Small Engine, Bill The Yellow Engine, Treavor, (or a bit more $ for:) The Lady Engine, James The Red Engine, Gordon The Express Engine (he's one of the best stories, I think), or Henry The Green Engine.  Now for the good stuff!  Give it a month or so, and then reward the child with something really cool like the Barrel Loader or Rusty the Construction 3 Car Set.  I honestly can't see the point in the huge multi hundred dollar system sets.  If you want to impress the neighbors or something, go for it, but I'm telling you.....most kids will enjoy a large number of small thoughtful gifts, not a "keep-up-with-the-Jones" effort on your part.  Good behavior can be rewarded with a pick-your-own trip to the store (there are sometimes when a real time shopping trip can't be beat)  By the way, the Thomas stories are based on real restored engines that run in England on the Mid-Hants Railway Watercress line near Winchester (you can read about them an even plan a trip to ride on the real Thomas trains by checking out  watercressline.co.uk).  They are a day trip from the London rail stations, although I recommend using a B&B in the Winchester area and staying overnight if you decide to go.  Winchester was the center of the old Saxon kingdom of Wessex of King Alfred as well as a major early medieval site (the Cathedral has the tombs of many of the Saxon Kings as well as Jayne Austen and Izaac Walton and it was where Richard the Lionhearted was crowned.)	1
My friend bought the old one from us. We have to buy a new one. This toy is a must-have	1
This game only pops up half the time.	-1
I like the idea of this game, but it doesn't actually work well.  Its possible to get through the whole game and then have to go back and wiggle each sword to see which one was supposed to set it off.  Kind of a bummer and made my kids lose interest.	-1
Cute game that my 3 and 4 year old enjoy. Worth the $11 price tag but I paid $20 and feel that was too high	1
My daughter's favorite game when she was little so I figured it would be a huge hit with my four year old niece	1
Wonderful game! Very happy.	1
Sadly, the game that I received only worked correctly the first time. After that, it wouldn't pop when the kids pulled the swords out. It sometimes randomly popped when they put the swords back in though. Other times it just wouldn't pop at all. This is so disappointing because I had really looked forward to using it with my students.	-1
Great suspenseful game for young kids, ages 3-7. You twist the pirate into the barrel, insert the swords and then you are ready to play. Each takes a turn and pulls out a sword until one pulls out a sword and the pirate shoots out of the barrel up in the air. It is fun for little kids as they analyze what sword to pick that they are going to pull out. Easy game as it doesn't take much to understand how to play which perfectly fits this age group. They can play and have fun and so can you and not have to explain rules time and time again.	1
So fun! Christmas HIT!!	1
3/4 year old enjoy it	1
Sometimes it does not work without resetting multiple times.	1
Use this in a pediatric clinic. Kids love it. Durable!	1
Fun	1
My pirate won't stay down	-1
I can't get the pirate to stay down	-1
I bought this for a 2.5 grandson as not many board games for this age. It is simple and no batteries! Just take turns putting swords in barrel to see which one makes the pirate pop out! I jumped every time which caused endless giggle. He had fun playing by self and with someone.  The 4 year enjoyed playing with him! They are allowed very little screen time so wanted something fun to take out on cold days.  Considering it came from England pretty quick shipping!  Just a fun toy for 2.5-4.5.	1
A BIG HIT this Christmas !!!	1
This game is so much fun.  I bought it for my grandkids but their Great Grandma even had fun playing this game.  I would recommend it to all kids of all ages.	1
I like it and my boys likes it too. The smaller 2Y likes it a lot even playing alone and having so much fun when it's popin' up. Good buy and I recommend it.	1
Personally, I thought this was an okay game. I bought it as a gift for my nephews. Little did I know, silly adult. They LOVED it. So, a little silly, but it gets my vote - kudos to you toymakers, for knowing your audience!	1
My son first played this game when he was in pre kindergarten.  He loved it so much we purchased it for his fourth birthday.  That was five years ago and one more child later.  The whole family loves this game! I highly recommend it for young kids and older kids!	1
As advertised. You can use it to play a variety of games.	1
Very pleased, would buy from again!	1
Grandkids (ages 4 and 6) love this game. It makes them laugh and is entertaining.	1
As a child, my parents bought me "Il Pirata" while we were vacationing in Italy in the 70's. I LOVED it as a child and would play endlessly with it. Being a father of a five-year old, I wondered if this game was still around. Wouldn't you know it? It is! I ordered it and now there are two family members who love it. (The wife doesn't care for games).  The premise is simple: You stick the pirate in the barrel, rotate him to change the position of a trigger, and take turns sticking little plastic swords into the barrel until one player triggers the spring mechanism inside. And out comes the pirate - not just a little bit, but he comes flying out. In other words, make sure your kid's head isn't right over the barrel as you play.  BTW, I still have the original from Italy, safe and sound in the original box - but I didn't want to sacrifice it to my daughter...	1
This is a really fun and durable toy.  Even thou my back then 3 year old use to think that if you make the pirate fly out you win, he really liked it.  He is now 5 and now knows that you loose is you hit the pirate.  It's a good toy for a quick fun game.	1
This is the classic stab-the-pirate-to-see-when-it-pops game. The kids enjoy it, and I enjoy seeing them enjoy one of my favorite games from when I was a small boy.	1
I think I got this when the grandson was about 2.  At 5 he will still play it--for a bit.  Well worth the money for a couple of years of entertainment.	1
A simple but fun game.  My 3 1/2 year old grandson enjoyed playing it.  It's quick and easy to play.	1
I had the game when I was younger and was excited to buy this for my 3 year old but I must admit I was disappointed with it when it arrived. The game itself is the same but the product is made of much cheaper plastic than i remember and the pirate doesn't always pop up. My 3.5 year old loves games but doesn't seem too interested in this one :(	-1
This puzzle is simply a fun one (it can be challenging) for anyone but will be of special interest to dog lovers.  In small letters each dog breed is identified along with the country of origin.  The artist has done a very good job in representing each breed featured here.  We enjoy White Mountain puzzles and have found they are a quality product made right here in the U.S.  This puzzle is not the best choice for beginners and my wife and I both agree that on a scale of 1  10 as to difficulty, this one would rate about a 7.  There were no missing pieces and all the cuts were precise.  We work for a couple of hours each day as we listen to books on CDs and have been doing this for years and years...actually did our first puzzle together in 1962.  Since we do not save our puzzles after completion we always donate them to long term care facilities in our area or the local library where there is a great need for such.  This one though would be a keeper if we were so inclined to have any of our completions mounted.  This was purchased at a local hobby story and if you have Prime you will find the price here on Amazon quite competitive.	1
My kids absolutely love this game.  It's great for all of us to play and no one can fight over anything.  : )	1
I didn't start it yet because of the holidays.  I'm sorry I bought such a hard looking puzzle.	-1
I received it fast, and loved it!	1
Puzzle appeared to be a second. It was cut wrong top to bottom. We had top border pieces that were about an 1/4 inch by 1/2 inch. The bottom border had the top of a different puzzle. It really looked bad.	-1
I love white mountain puzzles and have many. Highly recommend. Great quality and price!	1
Can't tell whether I like this game more or my son likes it more. It's exciting when the pirate pops up and the anticipation of that happening makes this game really fun. My 18 month old loves to watch as we play too. The swords are different colors so it makes it good to categorize the colors and also asking which color does he want to be, etc...Good opportunities to bond and laugh and not too complex for a 3 year old. You won't regret this. I purchased this for $13 but again that was almost a year ago. One of he best parts is that when the pirate pops up, he thinks that means he won (which is the exact opposite of what it really means) and that makes it even better so there are no losers in this game :).	1
Lots of fun and my grandkids enjoy playing it!  It was pretty pricey to us though and comes all the way from Europe which was rather unexpected.	1
Made a great gift!!	1
Fun and all the pieces fit great, really like the Mountain Puzzles, you can never go wrong...	1
everything good	1
Big advertisements on the package of the great quality of the pieces.  I bought if for the dogs pictures. I do puzzles differently than most people, I guess.  I separate the edges out and put them in a plastic bag, and put pieces in piles by color or pattern or writing, etc. It took me an hour to do all the pieces (1000) pieces. Some pieces were stuck together at two edges, some already was spreading apart on the head, some were not cut thru so had to be careful when separating them, and one the back was already torn.  This is about the worst new puzzle I have ever done.  I've done some puzzles 2-3 times, and the pieces have held up better than this one new.  I do the edge pieces last, so that I don't get my elbows in the way, and having to work around them putting pieces in.  So I have several piles of different colors or patterns.  That way, too, if someone comes into the clubhouse to work on the puzzle, they can work on whatever part they want.  Also, our puzzle table is small, so there isn't much room for a puzzle even this size to have the edges done, then have an area where one can work on the rest of the pieces. Try doing edges last next time you build one, let me know how you like it.  I didn't like the boxes of all the dogs, and wouldn't buy another like this, with the boxes, and not of this brand.  The lettering of the dog descriptions were so tiny, it hurt my eyes to figure them out.  Finally just put it away.  Give it away to someone somewhere.	-1
Purchased as gift for 4 year old grandson... he loved it!  Even his not-quite-2-year-old brother was able to play and the slightly older grandchildren were entertained too.  The older kids did figure out fairly quickly which hole sprung the pirate, but still a great toy for the suggested age group.	1
Not thrilled by this game.  I was hoping that it would be more challenging than it is, and it is pretty cheaply made.	-1
This was a really fun puzzle. Being able to check out all the different breeds of dogs while putting it together was really nice. On top of the great subject matter, it is a top notch quality puzzle. Pieces stay together great, they are nice and thick, and it is made in the USA.	1
great puzzle	1
I gave this to a puzzle enthusiast for her birthday--she loved the puzzle--the picture was very vibrant, clear, and colorful--she enjoyed all the different breeds of dogs--and--even found a cat hidden in the picture!  The pieces snapped together nicely--I will definitely order more White Mountain Puzzles for her enjoyment!	1
Dog puzzle ftw	1
Fun to work on	1
I understand that my grandson, who is 6 years old, and lives across the country is really enjoying this puzzle.  He loves puzzles and the more pieces and complicated it is the better it is.	1
I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old son for Christmas. There is a huge problem...inserting the sword in the same space pops the pirate each time. I have already returned one of the games to the store and the second one does the same thing.	-1
Pirate does not pop up unless swords are put in exactly. With younger children this is a definate deterant of fun. The pop up pirate does not sit appropriately in barrel leading one to beleive it's not in there properly. Also the pop up pirate should have been made of soft plastic like toddler blocks as getting hit with a hard piece of plastic isn't fun.  Cute ideal bad design.	-1
It did not work with my little one, he prefers to play with something different. I think that it has so many little swords to put in that it takes a while to see the pirate pop .....	-1
It's been a couple years since we owned this toy but I thought it was worth mentioning what I know about it.  When we had this toy we had two boys 5 and 4.  They loved to play the game and used it quite a bit for a couple months.  But after awhile they figured out which spot would make the pirate jump up and then it lost all use.  So depending on how observant your kids are you might have limited play time.  I do kinda wish I still had it because now I have a new set of little ones that would enjoy it...but I wouldn't buy it again.	-1
Game is a really great IDEA, but so POORLY made.  You have to hold the pirate down to push the swords in.  Kids can't just stick a sword in, it will tip right off the base.  My son does like to play this, it's just a pain to play.  Not a favourite.  I would NOT buy this again.	-1
This was one of my favorite toys as a child. I fondly remember playing with it in the car on long vacation road trips. I was excited to see it on Amazon and immediately added it to my son's Amazon Christmas list. It was exactly as I remembered it and I was excited to play with it with my four year old son. Unfortunately, he wasn't so excited. He has shown little to no interest in this toy. I'm not sure if it is because he is too young or too old for it, but suspect that when surrounded by all kinds of mega-plastic-noise-making-super-toys this simple quiet toy doesn't provide the same attraction. My plan is to bring it with us on our next vacation road trip to see if he will enjoy it more when stuck in the carseat with fewer distractions.	-1
My son had this game in the 1970's and it was played with over and over,, so I ordered 3 for my grandchildren.  I was so disappointed when they arrived as they are cheaply made of flimsy plastic. The kids love the game but because of the poor quality, my daughters have placed them in the kids' quiet time boxes, so they can enjoy them sometimes, but can also be calm and quiet with them.  I paid $11.85 each, and expected a higher quality item.	-1
I love leap frog toys, my 3 y/o has many. I usually find them very educational. However, this toy didn't live upto my expectations.  I wanted a toy to help him learn to write letters. My child learns very quickly with encouragement and correcting. At 3 he's reading at a 2nd grade level and writting somewhat legible (no thanks to this toy). This toys tells the name and phonic of each letter. The LF train, Little Leap and Leap pad do the same thing in the same way. I bought it for the writting lesson. It shows how to write them in 'computer style' not real handwritting. The reason I was so disapointed in it was that they can write anything in the spot and the toy tells them it's right. My son scribbled in the area and was told he did great. It wasn't teaching him anything. Sitting down and writting with the child, making sand letters and letting him trace with his finger and plain old letting him expierment with a pen and paper worked better than this thing. I took it back shortly after buying it.	-1
Not good. As other reviewers have stated they do not fit and stay stay together. Very poor design. These would have been great on our light panel but they frustrated my son that we don't use them anymore. To bad that Lego wouldn't do a translucent version of their Duplos! - which is the approximate size of the Alex blocks. I didn't expect the Alex and Lego brand to work together, but I did expect that the Alex brand blocks would fit together securely with other Alex blocks of the same exact style.	-1
It isn't worth purchasing. You could make this game yourself. Everything in the box is cheaply made, and the box is huge compared to its contents.	-1
My sister and I love to play games, especially music-related ones.  This game is not particularly well designed and the instructions seem to be lacking.  We'll make our own rules to make it fun, but as it stands it is a bit lacking.	-1
On the surface, this game appears to promote good Christian morals, but when you look more closely, it becomes obvious that players are able to game the system with "good deeds."  If there were any connection between this game and the real world, it would have three squares: Believe in your heart; confess with your tongue; and go directly to heaven, do not pass go, do not collect $200. Period.  Also, it would not have dice, or as we call them, "the Devil's sugarcubes."	-1
Good concept yet, Unentertaining, a disappointment	-1
not used- too small	-1
I wished I knew before buying the holes are not wide and tall as lego don't stick to them.	-1
Not sure what the purpose is... barely gets used. Once you stick things to it, it's practically impossible to get them off.	-1
Expensive	-1
Lego should be ashamed of itself.	-1
Flimsy.  I wouldn't pay over $2.00 for it.	-1
Very flimsy for the price.	-1
massively over priced.  I thought you would receive maybe 5 or 10 for the price.  NOT 1	-1
Pretty flimsy	-1
o.k	-1
would have loved it if it arrived intact. it is priced the same as anywhere else, but it arrived with a corner bent, which is totally unacceptable. especially it is not anywhere cheaper. pretty upset.	-1
The plates are flimsy and do not work well withe duplo. I always thought that all lego products worked together.	-1
This is not one of the large plates to build an entire lego set on.  It is a small plate.  Buy the grey plate if you want the large plate to build an entire castle or large lego play set.	-1
They need to take the word "Prism" off this product. Maybe it's a "light crystal" whatever that is, but it is certainly not a prism. I had a few small prisms as a kid, little ones about a quarter of the size of this thing, and they made rainbows in the light. This doesn't make rainbows from any light source I've tried. My other family members, looking at the item and the package, tried to tell me that it isn't meant to make rainbows, and isn't a prism so I shouldn't expect it to. They didn't read the product description here and buy the silly thing though. It' mostly just a hunk of plastic, it has some vague kaleidoscopic properties with the little rainbow cards it comes with, but all in all it is mostly just a useless hunk of clear plastic. Cheap, but pointless.	-1
My 3 year old daughter wanted a "rainbow" for Christmas.  I thought this would be a nice way to give her one - and teach a little science lesson at the same time.  I liked that it was acrylic, which makes it much safer and more durable for a young child.  Unfortunately, it barely works, which just makes it frustrating for a young child.  If I shine a very bright light on it, in an otherwise dark room, and get the angle JUST right, I can see a tiny, dim rainbow.  That's it.  I'm keeping it b/c it was inexpensive and not really worth sending back, but it was a bit disappointing.	-1
Well, yes, it looks good on display sitting on your shelf. But as for creating a striking prism rainbow i remember creating in 5th grade (decades ago) with a real crystal prism - it simply does not deliver at all. A standard household flashlight with new batteries should be enough to do the job but it doesnt. You can barely see colors on the outside fringes of the beam and you will need to hunt for them by rotating the prism. :(	-1
I wanted to buy a toy thats made in America but I find that this is very poorly made. The painting job is hodge-podge. The welding job is so bad and the black residue is seen in the welded spot. The metal has sharp edges due to not being well-made so kids can easily get cuts.  For over $8, I would have expected the toy to be much better quality.  The lack of detail is the reason why manufacturing jobs are moving to China.	-1
I bought this as a way to demonstrate some beginning physics principles to my daughter. I wasn't able to make gyroscope work. My husband was able to, but only after several attempts. The prism is very small and the gyroscope is poorly constructed. The instructions are difficult to follow. I should've known this would be a bust considering the very low price.	-1
What can be worse than the disappointed look of a anticipating child??  I bought this educational TOY for my little girl & son. Hoping that what i saw is what i should get.  Upon delivery, the package was Ok & intact, but the inside contents shocked me; The Gyro was waiting to be broken with a very low quality finishing and most important of all, it was NOT child safe! the Sharp edges of the outer ring (which was not welded at all) didn't meet & match to complete the circle, rendering the circle rather like a broken ring. i tried to pull them closer, but i felt it was going to snap the other vertical axis of gyro. The remnants of welding was obvious all over the gyro parts, as dark gray dust covered all the gyro, and it smelled TOXIC!! I donno how these stuff passed to US! I withheld the gyro from being given to my kids till i clean it up and see if it will hold safe without causing them any cut or wound! :( I said to myself: Ok, all of that might be mishap, lets see if it works! Spin, spin Spin,, and it Wooed and Vooed, and couldn't hold in place or walk the rope as they claimed, although i spinned it with max. force i could (which im sure a kid cant do!) The black little cone base was so light that the spin force caused it to shake & tumble over (it could have been counter weighed to be more solid and hold in place as gyro spins).  The Prism was ok, good that its edges were blunt.  The Magnets could have been better.. very cheap material, but i like the plastic wrapping, made them easily cleaned. The pole they are held by could have been a bit longer to hold them in place after the magnetic repulsion is demonstrated. If you press the magnetic discs down and release them (As any kid would do with them) they shoot upwards, and get out of the pole and fall off. its not a malfunction though, but rather like an improvement of the product.  What i learned from this experience?? Well,, i should have considered the 2 Stars reviews, and paid more attention before i buy such products. The Gyro Photos are to be uploaded shortly, and any requests, comments, or questions are highly appreciated, and shall be promptly replied. I hope my review is helpful for everyone who is concerned in knowing the real value of the product.. i hardly gave it 1 star for the quailty!!  I would have certainly sent this thing back, but as i shipped it out of US, shipping cost was more than the price of the item itself, and i don't find it worth shipping back & forth.	-1
Beanie Babies aren't what they used to be.  The quality has been managed out, so I advise to NOT get this toy.  Kids love and deserve toys, and there are lots of better quality items available.	-1
This is about half the size of a normal Beanie Baby. I was disappointed. It is cute though.	-1
Limp tail....  We have two other seahorses without this problem. Already gave it to my daughter without taking it out the package so I can't take away from here now. :(	-1
Pure garbage	-1
The Children's Librarian who I work with owns the baby black bear puppet. I loved it so much that I ordered one for myself. It wasn't the same quality. I am giving it two stars, because I am hoping that this was just one that got through quality control. I typically LOVE their products. This bear isn't horrible, but there are clear difference in the quality.	-1
I first purchased this game when it came out, years ago and it came with a great deal more materials.  It was at the time when the operating systems were Vista and XP.  I am very disappointed that (1) there has been a downgrading of the number of materials that come with this game, and (2) they have not kept pace with technology and upgraded the compatibility with the new operating systems.  It's still only compatible with Vista (I hated Vista) and XP.  Now we are seeing Windows 8 and this can't be used with that OS.  What a disappointment!  I need to contact the seller and return the game.  Also, there are far fewer materials that come with the game than originally came with it.  The paucity of materials is very disappointing.  I think that the OS should be listed as one of the product features and that there should also be a list of what the game comes with.  If you still have Vista and XP on your computer, and are inventive, you'll be able to use this game and it will be very entertaining and fun as well as educational.  If you do not have Vista or XP OS, you're out of luck.  Really, they need to update the disc so it's compatible with the newer technology and computers.  It was a great game when I first bought it.  Unfortunately, our school had a break in and this game was stolen, otherwise, I'd still have the original game that I'd purchased and made into "Shop-opoly" just for my special education students.  I'd wanted to duplicate it, so I purchased it again, assuming that with the change in technologies, the disc would have also been updated.  I'm very disappointed.  The game must go back, and the manufacturers need to update their disc which is central to the production of Make-Your-Own-Opoly.  Sorry, it's a disappointment if you have the wrong operating systems--the old ones--really old if judged in computer technology time.	-1
I just received this game for Christmas, and it is basically headed for the Goodwill pile.  Everyone in my family uses Macs, and this game is only compatible with Windows XP or Vista.  There really should be something for Mac users in 2012, or there should be some sort of disclaimer on the front of the box.  I'm hoping that people buying this game as a gift will see the negative reviews and think to check the system requirements so that they don't waste their money.	-1
Nothing to write home about. A bit of a flimsy stand (even with tape). Kinda a prehistoric design all around..not easy for a 3 year old to get the stomp part into a flat position by himself without the whole base twisting and falling over. Maybe Im just slightly a hater because my husband broke one of my hanging glass lanterns playing with this thing inside  rockets definitely pack a punch	-1
A really fun toy but the quality is not there. Shortly after buying the wings on the rocket began to fall off, and the stomping part disconnected from the tube.	-1
Broke within a couple mins of using it.	-1
I don't understand how this product has such great reviews.  Tight in the center of the tamborine it says Hohner and "China", the little wooden instrument is not properly sanded and finished.  It just looks plain cheap, items are plastic and wood seems to be cheaply painted.  Now I am growing suspicious about going based on Amazon reviews, which sucks since  reviews are one of the main reason why I favor buying in Amazon.  I am returning it.  not worth the over $30 I paid for this set.	-1
Fun but flimsily made! I had to zip tie the launcher so they didn't fall apart after ever rocket right out of the box. The rockets themselves are made of Styrofoam.	-1
This is not made in Europe or USA per search criteria; it is made in Israel, USA and CHINA.  Hmmmmmmm... cadmium, lead, melamine??  Pick your poison, but either way, my kid will not be getting such a "gift" from CHINA!!	-1
very cheaply made, apparatus that holds the rockets doesn't stay together, constantly falling apart.	-1
We loved launching these rockets, for the 10 minutes that everything stayed together. The base is three flimsy pieces of plastic that barely can hold together, use some packing tape and you can at least stick everything down to a hard surface. Otherwise the pieces continually fall apart, not to mention the launcher constantly tips over.  Bigger issue is with the rocket fins. The set we purchased must have had defective glue or something because none of the fins stayed on through even a single launch. One rocket had the fins fall off immediately. Again the tape helped out a bit since I was able to painstakingly tape back on a few fins which made the rockets fly way better. Without them though the kids still had fun but these were more like out of control missiles that would go in any unknown direction than they were rockets to launch up.  Even the 2 year old were wondering why this wasn't working!	-1
Fun concept. Base is a pain in the butt. It falls apart as soon as you get it together. You have to assemble it on the ground because going from your hands to the ground is too much for its delicate stability. Makes the toy frustrating for kids because Mom has to keep fixing it and frustrating for Mom too. I could try to glue or tie the base but I like to keep it in the box because we take it camping.	-1
My son and husband were so excited to get this out of the box and play. The rockets really go far and set-up is easy, however durability is awful. The "stomp" part broke after the third use and now it's useless. Really had high hopes for this. My son still wants to play with it, but for the price won't be buying again.	-1
I had this on for three hours before the pain was so bad i had to take it off. The seam on the bottom was large and bumpy, so it diggs into the bottom of your foot.	-1
Threw it away. Garbage quality.	-1
My daughter thought this was a blast, however the flimsy base is absolutely ridiculous. It requires a parent to hold it steady as the child launches the rocket. The base constantly falls apart is is cheap flimsy plastic. Very disappointed.	-1
Never worked very disappointing	-1
I am disappointed with the quality of this. The rockets are ok but the stand is three flimsy pieces of plastic that interlock. They do not stay together and constantly have to be reassembled every time they are used. I don't understand why they couldn't make the stand one piece.	-1
Broke almost immediately.	-1
I bought two and they are so cheap.. the plastic that is supposed to hold them up in anticipation of the stomp are flimsy and basically useless.  Thankfully, we could use the rockets on some of our NERF guns	-1
I purchased this for some friends for their kid's birthdays.  I was looking for another stomp rocket where the base is just 2 pieces but I couldn't find it on Amazon so I purchased this.  Right away, the parents had a hard time putting this together and keeping it together.  When I went to my friend's houses, the pieces of the base were just strewn around since the kids can't put it together themselves it lost all appeal of fun.  We have the Angry Bird stomp rocket with a base that my 3 year old son can put together so he plays with it all the time.  But I cold not find that on Amazon.  Spend the extra money and buy one with a better base.	-1
Only gave 2 stars since when it works, it *is* fun. Decently confusing to assemble the stand.  And once you do it will fall apart everytime you stomp the darn rocket.  This will caise your five year old to have a tatrum.  So order this nusiance if you want to reassemble the stand every.dang.time.your. kid launces the rocket.  I hate this toy and it "disappeared.  My kid did love it.  We had a couple laughs.  But it still sucked.  I hate toys that male me work harder instead of buying me some coffee and poop time while he is occupied ;)	-1
The rockets fell apart within in a few days.  The stomp part had several dings in it, so after every stomp we had to squish it back into shape before using it again. It ended up being more of a hassle than fun after just a few days.	-1
We bought this for our 3 year old.  It is very difficult to use, and the rocket base is unstable.	-1
My son loves these, however, the stand that it goes on, keeps falling apart. I have to constantly keep putting it back together. The part where the "stomper piece" goes onto the tube kept falling off as well. I have since taped it together. As for being "glow in the dark," they are not. Not at all. This would be so much more fun if the base was a little bit larger and came as a collapsible design, instead of trying to save space/money/packaging and making the user assemble it, only for it to continuously fall apart again. With that being said, he really does enjoy playing with it, so I suppose I'll just keep putting it together.	-1
The kids loved it but the orange based kept falling apart! Poorly made. Will need to ducktape the base together now (which makes it harder to store away).	-1
Nice concept, but after a few uses it really did not work well.  Did not hold up to normal play.  Wouldn't by again.	-1
Fell apart almost immediately. My toddler barely touched the styrofoam rockets and the blue wings that make it aerodynamic fell off.	-1
Its really flimsy. It hardly stands up.  From these reviews I thought I was getting a good deal on a great toy, but this is disappointing. It has 3 L shaped pieces that connect to each other to make a stand with tubing attached to the stand at one end, the other end has a plastic foot pedal. the rocket (styrofoam) goes on top of the tubing.  It can really shoot up, depending who is stepping on it, so it seems really dangerous because the tubing is pretty short and not very flexible, so when someone is stomping on the pedal the stand can get easily knocked down. And if it moves, which it does a lot, it could hit someone.  Also, the end of the tubing attached to the tubing where the rocket goes, is only attached by a screw and wing nut.  It can't even get that tight, it constantly moves as well.  How the hell is this a kids toy?  Total Fail!	-1
Worst piece of crap in the world. It is built very cheap. I know it only cost $10, but it isn't worth  $1.  It falls apart every 10 seconds. There are much better built rockets for similar prices. Save yourself the headaches. Also by the name Jr glow. It gives a sense of the rockets being glow in the dark, absolutely not.	-1
I'm surprised this won a top toy award because of the flimsiness of the toy.  It's almost a "one-use" toy.  The stand is almost laughable because of how flimsy it is and it doesn't stay together at all!!  My grandkids did keep playing with it after we took the stand off.  They just hold it and stomp on the foot pad. The hose has already collapsed when someone stepped on it.  It's fun and the kids like it, but it will be completely ruined by the end of the week.	-1
I have a bunch of other Folkmanis puppets from big to small. The quality of the racoon is not up to par With the other puppert.  The other pupets can stand k their own.  This kne limps around like it was strucm by an 18 wheeler.	-1
Do not buy this cheap toy.  DOES NOT WORK!  They give lots of hype on the toy, but it is a joke.	-1
rockets fell apart within two days	-1
I really wanted to love this, but it just didn't happen. I bought an off-brand regular sized stomp rocket for my 11 year old son and then decided to get this one for my 4 year old so that it would be easier for him to use. Just buy the standard sized one. The stand to this never did quite go together in a way that made sense, and the instructions were a bit confusing. Being made of flimsy plastic, it's not much of a stand anyway. The stomp pad was definitely a thinner plastic, making it easier for my younger son to use, but he was having a ton of fun running and jumping on the larger launch pad, that it really didn't matter. So long as we could keep this thing upright, he did enjoy getting his rocket higher than he could on the larger one; but, he would have been just as happy without this one at all. By the end of play, we had tossed this thing over to the side in favor of the sturdier, better, regular sized stomp rocket. We have not even bothered to take this back out of the package since our initial use of it.	-1
This isna great concept, but a super cheap version.  It barrly stays together and i had to tape it so it would stand up and point upward.  Dont waste your time....buy a better, more expensive  one.	-1
The rockets broke within the first 10 minutes and the refills are expensive. Not worth it and won't buy again.	-1
This thing barely worked out of the box and a day later the wings have fell off. Did not expect a lot out of this, but even with that it still managed to disappoint. Would not recommend.	-1
Horrible. Junk. Just bad. Worst quality toy. Hard to set up, use. Breaks easily. We have original and its so much better.	-1
5year-old great grand son played with it for only a couple of times	-1
The Rockets did go high, but for me it fell apart pretty quickly.	-1
Falls apart!  We were still able to launch the rockets, sort of, but I'm sure you can find a better or similar toy for the price. Would not repurchase.	-1
This toy was returned because some essential pieces were missing to hold up the rockets and because it required the stomp pressure of a much older child for effective launching of the rockets.  I would expect the youngest child to effectively use this unit to be at least 5, but 6-7+ would be better.	-1
It came apart the first time the kid used it.	-1
The concept is great, but this set in particular is flimsy and cheap. It's very easy to assemble, but unfortunately, it doesn't stay assembled. The three plastic base pieces continually come apart, the foam rockets have three missing wings already after using it less than one hour and one of us has to hold it together and let the kids stomp because it is so flimsy. I should have returned it, but during the birthday party we trashed the boxes. This is the only 1-star review I think I've ever given, but I would give 0 stars if that was an option. Save your money!	-1
didnt fly...ever	-1
Plastic stand doesn't stay upright - especially in grass.  We needed to hold the entire time.  Seems to be cheaply made.  It goes really high in the air but someone needs to hold the stand or it will tip over.	-1
It fulfilled its basic function of entertaining a 4 year-old (so I give it 2 stars instead of 1), but I was astounded by the cheap/flimsy material and low-quality design.	-1
Kids broke it very soon. It didn't hold up well rockets ripped right away and they bent. I wouldn't recommend it	-1
Cheap, this is cheap and not worth the money I paid for it! It broke soon after we go it! Do not buy!	-1
Our 4 year old had a very difficult time with getting this to work.  His hardest stomps barely got the rockets off the launch pad, even when he was jumping off a bench onto the stomp pad.  Our 10 year old had no problem getting great high launches off, so I know the product works okay, I just don't think its operation is well designed with little kids in mind.	-1
Rockets were total junk and fell apart instantly. They came off too quickly for our toddler even to see what had happened, which was also frustrating...very disappointing. Also, you will then be left with this purple thing to stomp on, and a long plastic tube. Our toddler constantly ate the tube and jumped on the device, which probably isn't a good thing.	-1
Not very realistic looking and fur was not soft.  Head spins all the way around (not very realistic depiction) and it was NOT a puppet!	-1
Not enough adhesive to hang all these.	-1
These are bright right after you turn out the light, but fade quickly. For claims they last a long time, I was very disappointed.	-1
LIES! it doesnt have over 700, its only like 100 plastick stars then 600 small crappy stickers..	-1
Has tons of pieces which is cool but they don't stay glowing very long!	-1
Very bad and the did not stick	-1
Only some of the stars have sticky on them and many are so tiny it is too hard to get them off the paper. The bigger stars come with a sticky putty that you have to apply and it makes it much harder. The star charts are poor at best. It has taken me hours just to put a few constellations. This is not a set I would recommend for younger children.	-1
These stars do not hold their glow for more than about 3 minutes after the lights go off.  That's a bummer.  I did buy a black light for my sons room and they will glow with a black light on all the time, but if you don't have a black light..don't waste your money.  I would also recommend buying more of the sticky tack to make them stay on the walls/ceilings. it doesn't come with much.	-1
the stars glow for maybe 3 minutes after you shut the lights off, even after charging all day. they DO look nice while they are glowing.  the amount of adhesive given would have worked fine if it was a much stronger adhesive......but they give you a VERY tiny amount and it does not hold up the bigger stars/galaxies well enough. they fall down.  so i will be purchasing better adhesive.  it does come with quite a lot of variety in shapes and sizes which was nice.	-1
My kid and I put them on the ceiling and he asked me "how are stars made?" I don't really know how they are made but this activity of putting them up on the ceiling explained nothing to me about how stars are made, what they do, how big they are or even their true shape (stars don't really look like that shape, have you ever seen pictures of them?). Anyways, we got them up and then they started falling on the floor. I think there is one left up there. My kid asked me "Dad, do stars fall to the ground like this?" And I said, "I don't know but if they are as cheap as these things then yeah they probably do."	-1
The glow doesn't last long enough.  Also it takes forever to put them up with the enclosed putty.  After being up there a week or 2, they start to fall off.  I don't recommend.	-1
The stars may be really nice, but the package I received looked already open. The 3 sheets with stickers appeared as if someone soaked them in water and the package was missing the putty to stick up the bigger plastic stars.	-1
Inspired by the other reviews of this game, I got it for my 6 and 8 year old. I was sorely disappointed, though. The major problem I have with it is that it really has to be played in multiples of 2--ie, 2 or 4 people. 3 people doesn't work very well at all, because then there's not really an opposite opponent for the 3rd player. I found this very limiting, since it's usually my 2 daughters and I who play games together.  That said, it was easy enough that my 6 year old could play with my 8 year old while I did other stuff, but I was looking for a family game.	-1
The person who was smart enough to invent this game of Pylos deserves credit. The game is logical and challenging. But...  This game is dull to play - that's the bottom line. I bought this game a couple years ago. We played it a few times to learn it, but had no further interest. We have not played it since, and we might never play it again.  The goal is to force your opponent to use his spheres to build the wide base of the pyramid, so that you retain a higher number of spheres and thus have the best chance of playing the final top ball - which is the one move that determines the winner and loser.  There are one or two obvious strategies. A better player could implement those strategies better, and thus win. Yet when we played we felt that the types of things to consider were rather one dimensional, move after move.  This game deserves 2-3 stars. Physically the game is well made.  If my pal wanted to play Pylos with me, sure I'd be happy to indulge him. But if I wanted to suggest a game that I thought my pal would enjoy, I would never suggest Pylos. Instead...  Try Quoridor, or Kamisado, or Khet, or Twixt (if you can find it). For a casual group try Quirkle Cubes.	-1
I didn't like this product for my son (8 months). It is not an educational toy and he didn't care at all to play with it	-1
others in same category are lesser in price. Check dimensions it appears larger than it is.	-1
I bought it for my daughter but it is very small is not what I expected and is overpriced also looks that soon my daughter will break I wasted my money	-1
When I bought this toy, I payed around $40. I really think that this is way too much for what it offers.  First, it's not really that big. My daughter is under 2 years old, and she has hard time tracking the beads through hard to reach places of this toy. I think that the wires are too tight in some places thus restricting access of little hands. Overall it's not very exciting. The beads are a little difficult to move around for a smaller child. Perhaps my daughter is just too young for this toy, and I'll keep on trying to encourage her to play with it. However, I do not recommend it at the price I bought it for.	-1
The Halo bear arrived with no tag. Everyone who knows beanie babies knows the tag should be on and in tact. Very disappointing!	-1
Meh, the kids played it once through, and it was a struggle to make it through. Basically it is a long winded game of memory.	-1
I found it boring as an adult, and my kids got frustrated by the dice factor. It seems engineered as a time-waster. Maybe needs some house rules. We played it 4-player and got bored waiting for our turn to come up.	-1
A little disappointing. Cute, but not a game worth buying.	-1
Confusing game. ..stupid	-1
My child is happy but frankly, I'm disappointed. The stuffing was so minimal that the cat looks lifeless and flat. It also smells like it's been hanging out in someone's attic for years. I will not be purchasing from this vendor again.	-1
If so, then this game is right up your alley. I bought it for our 6 year old daughter after reading the rave reviews.  Ummmm .... unless we were doing something seriously wrong, I don't get what all the excitement was about. Its dull, it takes FOREVER to get through, and it was a definite Christmas miss at our house. The overall concept sounded great, but the execution was lacking. That being said, the game components are of a beautiful quality, and Im sure that even with a lot of play, that this game would last quite a while.  Not our cup of tea, but if you enjoy spending upwards of an hour with a child's "no reading required" board game, and getting absolutely nowhere, then this is the game for you. Cannot recommend.	-1
i had this beanie baby years ago and was immediately disappointed in it. not only did i not like how the momma looked but the baby is especially ugly. both i think could of been made better.	-1
I ordered this and the Aurora Zany Zebra to compare as potential party favors for my 3-year-old's birthday party.  I found the Aurora one to be so much cuter (softer, fuller, a bit larger and more "personality").  This one felt very cheap compared to the Aurora brand.  I really didn't like this at all.	-1
I like the concept of this game, but didn't like the execution as well as I thought I would.  I found a surfeit of super hero and advertisement pics in the box.  The questions were pretty good, not too difficult or easy, but I still found myself losing interest fast while playing.	-1
I bought this game for 20-something year olds for Christmas based on the wonderful reviews here.  If you're looking to have FUN, LAUGH, and maybe have a beer or two this is NOT the game for you.  Firstly, it's difficult!  Seems like it should be easy but definitely not.  Secondly, it was like "who cares how many red cars are in the pic?"  We certainly didn't.  I can not think of one, not one, thing about this game that could be misconstrued as fun.  We played for about 20 minutes and everyone agreed they'd rather watch paint dry than play this game.	-1
The ratings of this game just go to show you how not everyone has the same likes/dislikes. I ordered this game and chose the 1 day shipping because I wanted it here to play with family on New Years Eve. We are all adults, the youngest being 20 and the oldest 59. we all eagerly sat down to play this game. It quite frankly sucked after a very short amount of time and that was a UNANIMOUS feeling!! The cards are not nice clear pictures, rather they look like retro stylized drawings and were mostly old movie fliers, etc. If you are someone who wears bifocals, forget it as there are many small items and often they are not very clearly depicted. Then you get 20 seconds (and we all agreed it wouldn't matter if you had 2 minutes)to memorize. The part that ruins the whole game are the extremely obtuse, off the wall questions that are asked. Also, you don't get the answers, so even the person asking the questions has to spend time looking at the tiny picture filled with poorly depicted items to determine if your answer is correct. It took us several hours of laborious, painful play to finish and we all vowed to never play again. So, I am out $30+ Anyone want to buy my slightly used (1x!!!) game for $20??? Yes, I will take a loss, but better than being out the entire amount. Way disappointing!	-1
its not rider as picture its fake	-1
After 10 days of delivery time, received defective cards. The back of the decks are awry - printed wrong. One site has more space than the other and it's a little crooked. Either these cards are fakes or bicycle has no quality control.	-1
Okay, who doesn't love a pack of Bicycle playing cards? My aspiring-magician son loved getting a twelve pack of these. Problem? The card decks often had duplicate and missing cards. I don't know if this was some sort of irregular product, but the description did not mark them as so.  Amazon customer service was very responsive in helping me.	-1
even though i read other reviews stating the cards were not the ones shown. i took a chance cause i really wanted the dice plus the cards to. the cards are bicycle but they are the cheapest ones they make. all five of the dice have the bicycle logo on them.	-1
I play Hand and Foot with a group of Senior ladies 3 X per week.  I bought a case of the cards, and was disappointed that the numbers on the cards are small.  It is difficult for the Ladies to see them, and they don't want to use my cards.  When I read about the cards prior to purchasing them, I do not recall any mention about the size of the lettering on the face of the cards.  Our groups have many decks of aging cards that have large, distinct numbers, so I never questioned this aspect when ordering.  If it matters to you, you just may want to find that out before ordering them.	-1
I remember this stinker! :D If you look at the boardgame itself, it has two circular paths. Basically, they amount to an "exact die roll needed to win", and we took one turn after another trying to land on the "exit" space as we kept moving our pawns around those circular paths over and over. I think we played it once then it mysteriously disappeared to the Goodwill somewhere. Can't believe people are still buying this game!	-1
The rules are too complex which makes it impossible to complete this game in a timely manner, it's worse than a family round of monopoly. You can easily run out of money before even leaving 3rd class.	-1
We got this for our school after the success we had with Sleeping Queens, but this one isn't as popular. The rules are confusing and it just doesn't seem as fun.	-1
nothing to write home about.  better kids games out there.	-1
We love to play games in our family, and we have enjoyed a number of Gamewright games. This is definitely not my favorite. It's actually somewhat boring and often ends up very lopsided with one person having way more points than anyone else. I wish I had bought something else.	-1
too complicated to learn quickly in a session. too many steps , directions, etc.  cute idea though. colorful and good quality of the cards.	-1
Two stars since it's phthalate free. But this duck disappointed me. I've had it less than two weeks and the rubber started bubbling and peeled on the bottom (see pics). The duck also seemed have some discoloration after a short time.  My daughter loved it and constantly had it in her mouth. She barely has any teeeth yet so it can't be from biting. I'm glad I checked it regularly for quality, but this duck is unsafe. I cannot recommended if it's for a child.  I returned it.	-1
Cute duck and fun. However, with most/all rubber toys, mildew/mold will eventually establish itself on the inside. I wish this duck came sealed so that water couldn't seep into the body.	-1
Disappointed this duck does not float upright and it has a squeaky hole that fills up with water making it hard to keep clean.	-1
Don't bother buying this as it will get mouldy very soon and you'll have to throw it out. it was cute but didn't last very long. also the inside gets full of water which you really can't drain out. Don't recommend at all.	-1
not good quality and not interesting for my daughter. I just gave it a way for free to another kid in about a week.	-1
Scale model trains generally aren't hands-on toys, especially for smaller children.  They're fragile and they can easily fail to work and break irrepairably.  They can also be very costly in purchase price and in the investment of time and materials put into building a layout.  I won't extol all the virtues of model railroading but obviously it includes art in the scenery, science in the electrics and electronics, social science and even economics in modeling society and industry.  So they are much more than a toy and can become a life-long hobby or avocation for an interested person.  One way to get started is to research and buy the good stuff, not wasting your time and money on junk like this LL set.  But if you over estimate your child's readiness to work with a model versus a toy, your mistake can be costly.  You may also not appreciate what modeling takes in terms of how much work it is, how much space it takes, how much is involved in terms of skills and learning.  This train set has got to be the rock-bottom cheapest HO set out there.  If not, it's real close.  The weaknesses abound.  I won't elaborate on them all.  The train is not accurate to the prototype (the real thing#.  It's made with poorly detailed plastic shell.  The engine's motor is cheap, won't slow-start but jumps, won't run slowly, won't stop slowly but jerks to a halt.  The cars are too light #they feel like an empty egg shell) and easily derail.  The controller only has one DC circuit and one AC and a poor potentiometer type twist throttle that is hard to regulate.  The track is very phoney-looking black molded plastic and code 100 rail.  Code 100 has very tall metal rails that are easier to manufacturer carelessly and hold trains well but look far too tall for scale.  If you "get into it" you won't re-use this track but instead you'll want some code 83 track or to hand lay your own code 70 or 55.  Still, the track and the rest of this set is so cheap, you can't beat it to have something almost 'disposable' to get started with and learn all the hard lessons.  It's like learning to drive in a beater.  The LL set I have doesn't have the plastic road bed.  This is a big improvement for durability in play.  Without the plastic road bed, you have to nail the track to a foam or cork road bed on a sheet of MDF or something or the track will easily break.  The plastic road bed is, of course, completely phoney for scale modeling and is a concession to the toy aspect of this product.  For a toy, I like the Fisher Price Trackmaster trains better.  They're bullet proof, both the engines and the track.  The durability is amazing and yet they're slightly bigger and better detailed than the wooden railways and less expensive.  I do prefer wooden railways for their craftsmanship though, particularly the older Swedish made Brio and the modern Thomas ones.  Another awesome toy to check out is the Lego trains.  They're quite costly with the power options but have two big advantages for play in that they're able to be totally customized, and they integrate with the whole Lego play system.  So their your have it.  If you want to try scale model railroading, this LL set is a cheap start and you'll learn plenty on your way to a rather sophisticated endeavor.  If you're looking for a toy, try Trackmaster for children 6 and under, and Lego trains for older children.  The play value is far better with either of those.  Of course, when I was six, I had to have the 'real' thing.  I got an N scale model and loved it.  If your child is attracted to the scale realism, no mere 'toy' will suffice.	-1
product broke within a few hours of playing in.	-1
Most kids played this growing up .. must say Matel really needs to stop pinching  every penny and invest a better quality product The sticks are so flimsy cheap its hard for my 5 year old to get them through as you keep adding more because the bend so bad . The Box is so flimsy thin.. very very thin cardboard They should provide a little bag to hold the sticks and marbles .. again the box is so cheap all the prices will fall out ! So have a zip lock bag ready Youll have to tape/ seal the entire end and sit the game up right since it doesnt stay closed  . I now remember why I threw this game in the trash from the last child	-1
I don't usually write reviews often but this game is terrible!  I just felt I had to warn others.  My 5 year old picked it for his birthday despite the bad reviews and after playing it several times I convinced him to return it and get something else.  The cylinder is flimsy and falls over.  The sticks are a nightmare to set up.  There are very thin and don't go through the holes easily.  It takes forever to set up which is a major deterrent to playing this game.  The marbles fall through all the sticks even before the game starts.  When the marbles fall, it doesn't fall to the correct players dish so you have to figure out how many marbles go in who's dish.  The sticks fall through the box and fall all over the place so even storage is a nightmare.  We have over 20 board games and this is the worst I ever bought.  I can't even believe it made it through testing and into mass production!	-1
CHEAP CHEAP!! Such a bummer too. I was really excited to get this game for my daughter. It was a favorite when I was little. The game is much smaller, less marbles, sticks are FLIMSY!! They slide out on their own. Save your money!	-1
CHEAPLY MADE. the plastic sticks so flimsy they bend and don't stay on when trying to play the game. Nothing like the original one	-1
This game was a bad thing to purchase. It's cheaply made and the sticks don't hold the marbles up and the tube doesn't stay up either. So then you have tube pieces, sticks, and marbles all over the place and no one had fun.	-1
They do not make them like they used to... Cheap flimsy plastic.	-1
I loved this game as a kid.  However the new version is horrible.  The stick are a super flimsy plastic that keep sliding out before you even get all of them in place.  Before you get half the way thru all of the marbles are gone.	-1
No longer made well. This doesn't come with many marbles and the plastic sticks are very flimsy.	-1
Cheap garbage. The hassle of setup combined with the tube doesn't stay in the holder as you turn it makes this game boil down to $10 for upset kids, frustrated parents and chokable marbles flying everywhere for the baby to find. I'll recycle it as soon as the newness wears off.	-1
This is very cheaply made.  The sticks are about as thin as thin spaghetti, bend easily and are very hard to both insert and get to stay in the holes.  The "tower" is very thin and you have to essentially hold it up while you're playing.  Just moving the tower around to another player's "slot/tray" causing marbles to fall down when it's not even someone's turn.  As another user said, this is not the game of my childhood, which was well-made and non-frustrating.	-1
Possibly the cheapest made game I've ever seen. If you breath on it - it will most likely fall apart. Loved this game as a kid and now it's made like junk.	-1
This game was legend when I was a child. I played it for hours and recall having such fun. Gaming has come along way in 30 years. My sons (two and six) barely find this enjoyable and I cannot stand it. The only reason I continue to play it is that my two year old will giggle if I make the marbles drop. And I like to hear him giggle.	-1
Not like the one we had as kids. The sticks are so flimsy they don't poke all the way to the other side. Would not buy again.	-1
A favorite game of mine when I was a child. It is made allot cheaper now though. Not very sturdy and even the sticks are not as good as the one's we played with back in the 70's. Very disappointed!	-1
Flimsy plastic.  Not worth the $$	-1
The quality of this game is so poor it's almost unplayable.	-1
These just aren't the quality they used to be.  The sticks are flimsy they don't stay in the container well.  It's not a horrible game if you have never played the original.  Would be nice if companies would stop being cheap and go back to making things the way they once did.	-1
I remember this game from my childhood and couldn't wait to introduce it to my kids. The game is still fun but the product is nothing like what we had in the late 80's.  The plastic skewers that come with the game are terrible and don't hold up like the wooden ones. The construction of the tower is really flimsy and comes apart very easily. The tower has structure problems and makes for a frustrating setup.  This game just had me wishing that I had my version from my childhood. Back when they made games that weren't as disposible as they are today.	-1
I'm just assuming it's how all games are now a days but it's made super cheap now.	-1
Very disappointed in this game. The stick that you stick through if you put them at any angle will fall right back out. They are very flimsy the whole game is very flimsy. The only saving grace is she likes just letting the marbles drop straight through. Very very disappointed	-1
I had this when I was a kid and this one is the cheapest quality of the original version. The plastic looks like it melted off the mold and barely works. Save your money. Too bad because it's a fun game.	-1
I loved this game as a kid. Well they definitely don't make them  like they use to. If anyone remembers the old game had wooden sticks that you put in and pull out well this one has thin cheap plastic sticks and they are such a pain in the butt to try to get into the holes and trying to get them to stay is even worse.  I would NOT recommend this game unless you can find the old version with the wooden sticks ( which is very very hard to come across)	-1
Lots of missing sticks makes game impossible to play. Very disappointed.	-1
Cheap. Nothing like the version I had as a child. Takes longer to set up than to play. The sticks bend and break and the plastic cone doesn't stay in place.	-1
Cheap garbage! Box was paper thin and the sticks broke let and right!	-1
The game is fine, but the quality of the game pieces is horrible. Nothing fits together properly and you can tell it is stamped out junk.	-1
Wow do they make things cheap these days!  The sticks are so lightweight and cheap they often fall out of the holes before the game even starts.  The box is so flimsy...Will gave to find some place else to store it. Such a shame the quality is now so poor on what used to be a great classic game.	-1
The only reason why I am giving one star is because it was delivered to us with only 10 of the 30 sticks needed to play, we have had to return this product.  Amazon returns quick and painless.  apart from the product missing the required amount of sticks, the game was in working order, was assembled easily (until we realised sticks were missing) and was made of decent quality.  Shame we couldn't play, my husband and I were looking forward to taking a trip back to our childhoods with a good old game of kerplunk.	-1
Great concept but cheaply made	-1
poor quality and very cheap appearance	-1
I loved this game as a kid, but this was a complete waste of money! The box it came in is thin and flimsy, the parts of the game don't stay together long enough to finish the game. Very disappointed!	-1
A fun game but poorly made. Cheap! Not made as well as when we were kids so very frustrating to little children trying to play it, won't stay together.	-1
Meh. As others have said not very readable. Not the same quality as the ones from the 60s.	-1
Well I bought this game because I remember from my childhood but let me tell you it is NOT the quality this game is cheaply made we played 3 times and the tube holding the marbles broke apart I would not buy again	-1
This was a great game when we were kids, so maybe my expectations are too high. The box was broken, and in poor condition, though it arrived on time. The sticks are very flimsy plastic, not thick enough to stay in the holes. The game is a great idea, but this is a cheap, very cheap version of an oldy!	-1
Funny, when I was a kid I never noticed how cheaply made the game was or maybe the standards have slipped over the years.  The rods are flimsy and it's not fun having to re-load the game.  Not enough rods were supplied with the game either.  Very dissapointed. A bit boooo from me.	-1
The pieces are made of only the flimsiest of plastics, barely fit together and the sticks just slide out of the holes on their own.  The tower doesn't fit properly in the base, making it too easy to pull the tower off kilter.  Lastly, the box is just the wrong shape.  you have to dismantle the entire contraption to fit it back into the box, but the box is very large.  If the box had been made oblong, with the same amount of material, the game could have been left together when stored.	-1
It takes about 5 minutes to set up, yet the game only last 2 minutes. Not worth the time to set up.	-1
Don't buy this is fyou want to play with a child they will become irritated at how many times it falls apart while trying to set it up. I went on Ebay and bought the Original and it was in great shapestill	-1
The sticks are not wood they are plastic that bends within minutes of opening the box. This was useless withing a few hours after opening the box.	-1
I have 4 kids, 6 yr old, 4 yr old twins and an infant. I wanted something that the older 3 could play together, and something simple and fast. This was definitely something they could have fun with but they cannot play with it without an adult. The plastic pieces of the main body don't fit tight together so if you knock it around, it wobbles and could fall apart. The sticks are flimsy/bendy. When you stick it through the wholes, they bend depending on which hole you put it in (if not aligned properly). And then when there are a lot of sticks already, putting the last few sticks in is a little tougher. Sometimes some of the sticks just fall out so I sort of have to "stitch" other sticks in to make sure it's over and under the others so it doesn't just fall out on it's own.  There is a little basin on the bottom for each player. So the tube body part rotates so that when the marbles fall, it falls on that player's basin. But the frustrating thing is, the whole tube body is wobbly. Just by rotating it, the balls could fall through and mess up the game. So this job isn't for little hands. I have to sit with the kids and rotate it for each player.  The other frustrating thing is there is no way to store the game without the marbles and sticks falling out. The box it came in is not a hard one so it's destroyed once opened. Then the pieces don't just stack properly in order to just put the marbles and sticks together. There's just no way easy way of storing it so the pieces don't get lost.	-1
I'm shocked that anyone would give this game ANY stars. It's so cheaply made and poorly designed as to be basically a throw-away. It's so flimsy that you have to carefully hold the top when pulling out a straw. If someone pulls the wrong straw and the marbles come out it will usually jam...every time in fact. The only fix is to use very few marbles. You'll spend more time threading the straws than actually playing and no attempt has been made to make the tower stable. It's just amazingly cheap and you'd be better served by playing with the box. Mattel should really be ashamed of themselves for taking such a simple concept and turning into what is little more than a pocket-picking scam. Any McDonald's Happy Meal toy is of higher quality. ZERO stars.  Capt RB	-1
I misplaced a version I purchased several years ago.  Today's model is ultra-cheap.  The sticks are too thin and slick, often sliding out of the holes on their own.  This makes setup a pain.  As a child I used to enjoy placing the sticks in various alignments.  Now, unless the sticks are horizontal, they will slide out.  The module rocks in the holder, easily causing marbles to drop as you change turns.  This makes gameplay annoying for children who are not ultra delicate in their handling of the game.  Instead of buying this cheap version I would suggest shopping for a vintage model.	-1
This game is very difficult to set up to even play it.  You have to put all the sticks in the holes and they slide out a lot and you have to start over.  If you can get it set up, it is a fun game, but there is a big if there.	-1
Like some other reviewers mention, the Ker Plunk game here is an updated version of a classic game beloved by my parents and myself as children. My husband and I were eager to introduce this game to our 5-year-old and thought it would be a fun game to play with as a family. We did have fun, but the two adults (me and hubby) found the shoddy construction particularly deplorable.  Basically, the game parts consist of two plastic tubes with a plastic connector in between. These three parts are to be manually attached together and stood on the game base which is also made of plastic. The plastic color sticks are then to be inserted through the little holes in the tube connector in a crisscross pattern which will serve to hold the marbles ( which are provided in the box).  The problems with this game are mainly due to the cheap plastic parts - they are so insubstantial and moving the canister (for each player's turn) is cumbersome as a result and inadvertently jolts the marbles even further. Luckily, my 5-year-old was patient enough with the careful manipulation during each player's turn, and we did have fun, but we found the overall experience to be underwhelming.	-1
Waste of money. Answer triangles struggle to come to the top and you almost hVe to keep shaking it to get an answer to appear. The same 3 answers pop up.	-1
Cant see print on ball unless in pitch black room.	-1
Too expensive for what it is. It works, but it's small and cheap looking.	-1
Loved playing as a kid now my daughter loves it	-1
We live in AK and so we thought we needed to find something to keep our toddler active while being cooped up during the winter. Our son loves it...WE HATE IT! It takes up almost the whole living room...that's not the bad part! There is only a bottom in the Large section. The two medium section are open on the bottom so there are always balls everywhere! We bought extra balls (which you need) but our house turns into a ball pit! But we make it a game with our toddler to pick up the balls...but WARNING you will be finding balls for days!	-1
I think it is a hit or miss on this product. I have a friend that has a Playhut and it is fine. We just opened ours and at least 6 seams are coming undone (not sewn correctly), there are a couple holes in the material, 2 forgotten attachment loops, and it is rather flimsy. Kids still like it, though it isn't going to last too long.	-1
can barely read the dice, cheap and not worth the money	-1
The item arrived on time and was packaged well. The Magic 8 Ball did not work. My son shook it but the triangle would remain sideways-tilted. I can make it show the answer with some manipulation. My 6 year old can not so it's  ineffective.	-1
I bought this a a gag to have when my wife would ask me a question, but you can't read the thing. Sometimes the flat part will not rest against the portal and sometimes when it does, you can't read it. It is not like the one I had when I was a kid. Since it is so hard to read, a lot of decisions go unmade in my household.	-1
Super poor quality.	-1
Was a joke gift, but disappointed that it is NOT the same as we remembered... the new version has a poorly balanced floating triangle and is illegible.	-1
Can't see words clearly	-1
I was excited to get this for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas as I remembered playing with these as a kid. I was disappointed because it is hard to get the inner dice to settle in the viewing window. It takes a little maneuvering to see the message. My daughter had fun with it for a few minutes, but the novelty wore off fast.	-1
The pieces are poor quality. I only got it as a novelty. Not particularly happy I did.	-1
No instructions. Not much fun.	-1
Only the edges show through the window so it's impossible to read anything. What a piece of junk. So bad my daughter who received it for Xmas threw it away.	-1
Fuzzy cant see answers	-1
I read some reviews on lesser priced product of this and thought surely a brand name like Mattel would be different. Only one answer showed and it was so tiny as to be illegible. The rest of the time only an edge showed. I returned it	-1
This is NOT the original. IMO this offers way to many answers, most of which are NOT an answer.	-1
did not order	-1
The quality of being able to read the message inside is terrible.  The water is too dark.  Not able to return either.  Wouldn't recommend.	-1
My daughter really wanted a Magic 8 ball and we bought them as party favors for her and her friends.  They did not work well at all - answers slow to show up, very dim, and sometimes didn't show up at all. I would think they needed to have the batteries changed, but you cannot replace the batteries on these.	-1
The little floating thing inside is too far down, you can barely read the writing!  :(  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  :(	-1
I remember these things being more fun :/.  The little 'magic' triangle gets stuck frequently, my daughter seems unimpressed.	-1
I guess I shouldn't be surprised that it doesn't work. I just assumed after all these years they would figure out how to get it right. Out of the box it wasn't working. It would show up sideways and you have to shake it and shake it and finally it gives an answer.	-1
It is very hard to read the answers.  The window is large enough, but the lettering is not.  Disappointed	-1
JUNK, HARD TO READ! ALMOST LIKE IT WAS OLD PRODUCT.	-1
Defective	-1
Hard to get the answer piece to lay flat, usually only get an edge unless you shake it around a little.  Liquid is too dark so you have to struggle to read answers when they finally do lay flat.  Bought two as gifts for little girls in my family and I am slightly embarrassed to give them to them because I know they will be frustrating.	-1
These are a fun toy for kids but the one I received was defective.  I should have returned it, but it seemed like too much effort, for the cost. Not sure if this sheds bad light on Amazon, the selling store, or the manufacturer?????	-1
Hard to read	-1
Horrible buy 8 ball dose not work	-1
Not like the 8 ball of yesteryear.  Too cheap.	-1
My nephew wanted one as a christmas gift. When you shake it the dice inside doesn't even come up even in the window, usually edges of it. I see why they went out of style.	-1
I think the liquid is a little too thick and dark, and therefore kind of hard to tilt it just right to read the response.  I wouldn't buy this again.	-1
Such a disappointment!  You have to be very lucky to get the little triangle just  to "float" to the window and on the very rare occasion it does, the liquid is too dark so you can't even see the answers!!	-1
I had this toy when I was a kid and had SO much fun with it, so I bought one for my son and it's NOT the same quality toy.  It's nearly impossible to see the ball's answer because it's not clear and too small.  Why do they make it so small when the area to view it is twice the size?  Anyway, after we ALL agreed it was useless, I will return it.  I have NO idea how it received so many good reviews???	-1
I bought two of these Magic eight balls. One for me and a gift for someone. The package reach on time, but to my dismay and anger, the window where you are suppose to view the answer is clouded up you can't see anything, it's two that I bought and it's the same with the two. This was really really disappointing. Anyone out there, a warning. Do not buy this item.	-1
The zipper did not work on lady bug. I sent it back. It was not for small children so I would not reorder. It was cute but I'm not sure how long they would be kept busy.	-1
Entirely impossible for a baby to play with. The activities are too difficult to use: zipper won't open even when an adult tries, and snap buttons are difficult too.	-1
This was terrible. I should have paid attention to the reviews. The textures all feel the same. There is only one small piece of Velcro on the balloons, the other side is felt so they don't stick. The snaps on the shapes are hard even for an adult to unsnap & the zipper is just as bad. The hands on the clock are hard to move. Need I go on? Plus as one review pointed out, too many pieces to get lost since none of them are permanently attached. But the worse is that in order to return this to the manufacturer, you have to pay a non refundable P & H, etc!	-1
Not great. Quality is not as good as other quiet books. Small, removeable pieces are not attached to book as with other quiet books- which is a choking hazard. If your kid is under 3 or 4 and likes to put things in their mouth do not buy this- it's dangerous. We had to take all the small pieces out, which defeats the purpose.	-1
This book is very cute in the sense that it zips up nicely like a little suitcase. I was expecting a bit more since this puppy ran me about 30 bucks, but i am hoping that it will prove worthy. I am not going to let my child play with this right away because then it won't be fun the next time I need to keep him quiet! This is what the book offers: BUTTON THE FLOWER - a big button for the kids to put the flower on. I am hoping that this button will be sturdy enough for my 2 year old so i don't have to sew it back on, but it seems pretty tough! ZIP ME, WHAT'S INSIDE? - A ladybug that you can unzip and reveal a baby ladybug. MATCH MY COLORS - balloons that are velcroed on the back and you match the red to the red, blue to the blue, etc. Wish the velcro pieces were a tad bigger. SNAP ME ON MY SHAPES: Same concept as the balloons, only shapes with snaps on them (a bit hard for my 2 year old COUNT MY WHEELS PUT SOMETHING IN MY CARS - A train that has 2 pockets in it's cars that you can put 2 little dolls into. LACE THE FOOTBALL - A football that you can lace up like tennis shoes and tie a bow with (hard for my 2 year old, obviously) BUCKLE MY BELT - This isn't like a seat buckle, this is more of a cheap cloth buckle that you find on cheap pants (kind of hard for a 2 year old) FEELY FINGERS - 4 Rectangles that are supposed to be differnt textures, but unfortunately they are all the same. I wish they would have put more effort into this page, as the textures should vary greatly and they DON'T. WHAT TIME IS IT? A sun shaped clock that you can move the hands on. Overall a cute book, just hoping it delivers. I will repost at a later time if it does/doesn't. A bit expensive, but i haven't found any that are not expensive, for whatever reason. Made in Phillipeans, should be cheaper, in my opinion, but like i said I have high hopes for this purchase. The product is a bit difficult for my 2 year old, but some pages are just perfect for him, so this book will definitely grow with him! Update: it is 2014 & I still have this book, it has held up just fine, but I want to reiterate that the Velcro pieces are too small on the balloons, I lost a balloon & contacted the company for a replacement...instead of sending me a 20 cent piece, they want me to pay 2.00 for it. No thanks, I'll make my own. I know they can't replace everything for free, but a thin cheap balloon, just send one out as good customer service! If you can get this cheap, I would say, get it. 27.00 is too much, unless they upgraded the pages. I'm going to sell mine on eBay& 'if I need another quiet book, I would buy a better book next time, one with more variety, its way too baby for a 4 year old, the book will last your child about a year, from age 2-3.	-1
10 days after return window closed and the battery stopped working. My kids don't drive their PowerWheel daily because the weather it's fall in Chicagoland...so I didn't know it wasn't working until recently.	-1
I've only had this battery 2 months and it suddenly stopped working. When I plug it in to charge, nothing.	-1
Beware this battery does not hold a charge!! Bum battery.  Amazon gave me a full refund thankfully!!	-1
This battery is terrible. My son can only play for an hour on a full charge before it dies. I went out and bought a 12v Deep Cycle battery with 12amp and couldn't be happier. For 50.00 my son can ride his tractor all day long, no fusses. Some reviewers said you had to splice the new battery wires,thats not the case. I brought mine to battery exchange and they took the plug in off the peg perego battery and attached it to the new battery. Easy as pie. Would suggest everyone do the same	-1
Our battery quit recharging after about a year.  It is very dissappointing to charge a battery for hours and then have to tell your little one that it didn't work.  It has been difficult to find another battery.  I thought the Fisher price 12-volt would work but it did not connect. Apparently, you have to buy this brand, which, by-the-way, cost about a third of the cost of our tractor!  What can you do?	-1
So small could barely provide shade for an ant.	-1
Broken on the second day.	-1
It just didn't really work	-1
Hardly holds onto the radio flyer wagon ..... Or anything else for that matter. Also umbrella is too small to be of much use. It could be worse - but I would not recommend buying this.	-1
Broke after a week	-1
Shes loves it and still plays with it at 2 - she sings along	-1
Small leak and you cannot get on it for anything	-1
Darn thing leaked the first day. The kids were devastated.	-1
Warning label is on the top so takes away from look I returned this product	-1
Found leak in it on 2nd day near the tail.  Believe it was already there with a slow leak.  Too much money for this to have a leak.	-1
Item was great.	-1
Feeling nostalgic, I purchased this for my children to experience during our recent vacation.  However it didn't hold air for 30 min, I was quite upset.  I remember growing up with one of these, it lasted my siblings and I the whole summer, we loved playing on it.  I guess the quality went down hill and I just wasted $17.	-1
Deflates constantly after just one month. And day out of return window. Horrible.	-1
This pool was great I have two toddlers and I wanted something big enough that I could join them and teach them how to swim. I loved the pool until it ripped because my 27lb son jumped in the pool. I told you his weight to demonstrate that he is super small and he was able to rip the plastic. I was very sad when I had to toss it after only 2 weeks of using it:-(	-1
Pool is fine, like any other blow up pool.  The sun shade is a joke.  I ended up using a queen size sheet draped over four high-back lawn chairs.  That worked great at shading out the hot sun.  Buy a cheap pool and made your own shade!	-1
I purchased this pool in August of 2008 for my daughter's first birthday party. It was a huge hit - the kids loved it. But when we unpacked it this summer and tried to fill it, we discovered that the pool had developed a leak around the valve, and deflates completely within half an hour of being inflated.  The shade worked great for us, even on windy days, but the pool just isn't durable enough to last more than a season. I plan on replacing it with something more sturdy this year.	-1
This is really cute but frustrating for my 4 year old. The chestnut horse works fine but the Quarter Horse only has 3 hooves on the ground and falls over easily.  The roof does not have anything to latch onto, so  we have deemed it a removable roof. I don't think this was a product feature as there is no reference or pictures to this effect. But it isn't easy enough for my child to put back on so we might super glue it.  The floor is hollow under neath, making it dip in the middle. But this causes the stall doors to not shut properly and only the horses with 4 feet on the ground will stand on this.	-1
Difficult to assemble and would not stay snapped together. My daughter couldn't play with it without it falling apart on her. Wound up throwing it away, total waste of money.	-1
I played with the classic wooden stable when I was little. This red stable is flimsy at best. Stall doors don't stay shut and constantly comes apart at the seams.	-1
Fell apart! Cheap made	-1
Difficult to put together, kept falling apart and continues to do so as my granddaughter plays with it. Other than the white horse, the animals are so tiny they are ridiculous. Cheaply made. Sorry I purchased.	-1
Cheaply and poorly made. Ours came with one of the wall connectors broken. The whole thing is just unstable regardless. Buy the red barn or even the Breyer Deluxe Animal Hospital instead - both of those are made much better! **We returned this for a refund, as we don't want a replacement.	-1
Nothing wrong with it but it was a gift and child wanted me to exchange it	-1
Cheap plastic that is flimsy.  Not sturdy and very over priced.  I will be looking for better alternatives.	-1
Cute stable but it falls apart!  The stable comes in pieces when you buy it; it needs assembly (so, it is NOT one solid piece).  The pieces are always laying around my daughter's room and she needs help putting it back together.  The roof comes off a lot.  I don't think she's rough with it.  I wish this were made better because it's a cute idea.  Poorly, poorly made.	-1
Is toy is so cute;  however, my daughter stop playing with it after it rolled over her hair & got all wrapped up in the wheel. We had to cut it  out of her hair; kept the toy, although she hardly plays with it now. Not much to it after you were done with going back-and-forth	-1
This is a very fragile and flimsy toy for a child to play with, especially considering the price of these sets. My daughter loves to play with it but I am very disappointed with the quality. The roof and fencing always fall off, the blanket for the horse ripped and one of the signs cracked off. My daughter is not rough with her toys and this particular toy is carefully stored in her closet when not in use. This would be a super cute set if it wasn't so poorly made!	-1
After one day, the remote no longer worked.  This is a piece of junk.  Do not buy.	-1
not good	-1
I ordered three of these - police car, school bus, and pink buggy -- and they all came in the same frequency.  That means each remote control affects all three cars if running them at the same time.  I called KID Galaxy, and they said they only make them in two frequencies. So why does the second video posted on the product page show kids playing with three cars at once, all independently? Short version: This was a total fail, Kid Galaxy.	-1
Falls apart and is no fun to play with. Waste of money. Buy Scheich instead. We did and we threw this trash away. Love Breyer horses, but these buildings are poor quality.	-1
made cheaply	-1
What I thought I was getting was a high quality product considering the price. What I got was flimsy plastic pieces that kept coming apart and felt so cheap. I ended up returning all of the unopened Breyer products. Too bad I opened all of these pieces or I would have returned this stable as well.	-1
Piece of junk. I bought this for my 4 year old with high expectations of the Breyer name as I had their toys as a young girl, roughly 30 years ago. This toy is much more suitable for an 8+ year old. My mistake. The quality of this barn is ridiculously cheap. Assembly is challenging as the pieces feel as though they will snap as you apply pressure to snap them into place. Once it is together you may as well get some Krazy glue because nothing is secure. The doors stick, walls collapse, the floor sags..... what an embarrassment. My son broke 2 of the doors off within 30 minutes. I should have purchased a basic wooden barn.	-1
Opened on Christmas morning and my 3-year-old figured out the controls quickly. Five minutes later, it stopped working. Batteries are good, no rough play. We have a disappointed kiddo; this was his big gift from Santa.	-1
Bought this toy for my kid for christmas. It came without a remote control. Total waste of money.	-1
Stopped working responding to remote within 48 hours (tried changing batteries etc no luck). I will not buy from Kid Galaxy ever again. I gave as a xmas gift bought early in Oct so was not able to apply for refund. I would never by this product again and wished I had looked at one star reviews before buying. Why can't a company make a quality remote car for young children? Also I bought the pink beach buggy and because it was on same frequency as the bus the two children were very frustrated (3 and 4 years old) trying to operate together. Amazon please require Kid Galaxy to state this in item descriptions for all their cars. Their video showing two kids playing with two cars together was what sold the deal for me.	-1
The roof does not lock on, the doors come off regularly and my DD is almost 9.  I would not buy this again if your kid is going to actually play with it. For collectors if it is just sitting on a shelf great, for an actual TOY it stinks.	-1
My daughter got this for her birthday and she loves the idea of it; but every time she plays with it, it falls apart.  The bridle broke within days. I wouldn't buy another Breyers toy after seeing this one.	-1
Box was open and all animals were missing except white horse. I sent it back for a refund.	-1
Do not waste your money on this unless you like to super glue.  I had high hopes and my daughter gets so frustrated playing with this.  The animals are microscopic and the roof DOES.NOT.STAY.ON.  We are ver assembly saavy and this is just such poor quality I really wish we would have kept the box on Christmas day because I would be returning it.	-1
We actually bought two of these  from a local toy store (one fire truck for our boy, one pink surfer car for our girl) for Hannukkah 2012.  A few months after we bought them, the pink one stopped working.  No reason...fresh batteries, etc.  Just didn't work at all.  We took it back to the toy store and they worked with the manufacturer to get us a new one at no charge.  In about December of 2013, the firetruck stopped working. Same problem as pink car.  Took it back.  Got a new one.  That fire truck didn't even work right out of the box...completely unresponsive.  Tried contacting the manufacturer...no response.  It is obviously a defective model, not just a hit-or-miss thing.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.	-1
Piece of junk! We bought this set at toys r us, and ours did not come with animals- the the structure and vet table, etc.  we took it back In Pieces in a box and toys r was was great and refunded us no problem! My kids r 7 and 10.... They are not rough with things and we were loosing pieces weekly, like signs breaking off, the fencing breaking off, etc. not to mention that we were reconstructing the thing at least twice a day.  Great idea Breyer, make it better. We loved the idea and were sad that we couldn't find anything else that had the indoor vet and outdoor vet idea. My kids love animals of all kinds and love watching shows like dr Pol and dr Oakley, so we were so disappointed when this thing wasn't as great as we'd hoped. Super glue won't help with this disaster- the parts are just too thin and break apart too easily.	-1
broken straight out of the box... I wouldn't have been so frustrated except that we bought 2 and NEITHER worked.  NOT ONE TIME... both got returned	-1
Rated this low as it's not worth the money. The picture on the box even got me excited to want to play with it as I was a farm girl growing up.  The toy itself can not withstand a 5 year old.  It's always coming apart and then we're digging for pieces in the toy box.	-1
I usually like all the Breyer products, like the Stablemated Red Stable set, but this particular piece seemed to be very poorly constructed.  It was difficult to put together.  Some sections of the walls could not be pushed into place all the way, even with the application of a good deal of force, which might easily have resulted in breakage.  Consequently, the hinged roof section will NOT seat properly.  It's supposed to swing open or closed, to allow you to look inside the front room, but it keeps falling off if you try to close it (due to the fact that the wall sections don't fit together properly).  The only way to keep it in place is to keep it in the "open" position.	-1
I bought this for my 1 1/2 year old and at first it worked fine for maybe 3 months.  Now it's broken.  We have tried everything.  Piece of JUNK!!! Wish I could get my money back.	-1
I got it in the mail today as a birthday gift for a five-year-old. Needed batteries, okay no problem/. It uses a 9 volt for the remote, which is okay for radio controls I think. Worked good for a small child's RC car. I liked its squishy rubber exterior. About one hour later, no longer turns, just goes slower when turn button is pressed. Not very happy.	-1
This was such a disappointment. Altogether cheaply made...the roof will NOT stay on, so I finally gave up and told the child it was supposed to be off so she could "clean the stalls."  Flimsy and comes apart every time we lift or move it. Thought Breyer was supposed to be a quality name but would not buy from them again. I would have given one star, but the 8 yr old I bought this for seems to like it when it stays together.	-1
My daughter thought this was boring. The stable is nicely made, but the horses are tippy and not usual Breyer quality.	-1
Really wanted to like it but I couldn't even get it to run.  To add batteries to the car you need to use a Phillips head screwdriver to remove one tiny screw.  Unfortunately, the screw on the one we have is stripped so it was impossible to remove it!  Also, the remote control battery compartment has poor tolerance, making it very tight to install the battery, and basically broke the metal tip of my 9V battery (!).  Doesn't worth my time and I am returning it now.	-1
This toy appears to be good quality and is easy to use and my little boy enjoyed it until it stopped working...within less then a year of occasional use.  Changing out the batteries did not prove to be helpful.  It simply "gave up the ghost" and was ready for the trash bin.  Very disappointing.	-1
To begin with, it is difficult to install the batteries. And in less than a week, the remote stopped to work. I got new batteries installed still no luck. I should have read the reviews before I purchased this. It's a total waste of money.	-1
Cheap quality! It falls apart everytime you touch it. Had to superglue Most of it. The red breyer plastic barn was the same. Very disappointed	-1
I bought this for my 6 year old daughter, as she is a horse fanatic!  Well, just like all the reviewers, they are right!  you spend more time putting it back together than playing with it!  WHat happened to the quality toys that i remember as a kid?  Don't waste one penny on this heap!	-1
Purchasing this toy is simply throwing money away.  I am astounded at the amount of things breaking on this stable, and the companion truck/trailer set my daughter was given as a gift.  The concept and look is great, and the opportunities could have been endless for play if my daughter was not bringing pieces to me one by one from these sets.  She is 5 years old and gentle with her toys, but this toy simply can not handle being played with even as intended.  There are things we can fix, like the cupola or roof shifting/falling off, but it is also beyond repair where gate/door hinges break.  We were without receipts for this item or it would have gone back the first day when the breaking began.  We have had a much better experience the Schleich jeep and trailer purchased for her 3 year old sister, but have not found a similar sized stable.  Again, these Breyer accessories are a waste of money for use as a toy being so poorly constructed.	-1
My daughter has collected Breyers for years. This Breyer play set is not worth your money. The plastic is too brittle and the stable is designed very cute but not easy to play in the different rooms. We also bought our daughter the Playmobil Stable. Buy the Playmobil it is worth the extra money!	-1
Don't buy this if you expect it to actually stay assembled!  I bought this for my horse-crazed daughter when she was 4. She is not overly rough with her toys at all, but every time she tried to play with this thing the roof fell off. And then some of the doors would. And forget keeping the little chimney on without some super glue. My husband and I both put it together several times, and my husband can rebuild motors for pete's sake! We're not clueless people by a long shot when it comes to assembling things, but this stable frustrated us both beyond belief. The pieces absolutely would not stay snapped in correctly, no matter what we did!  I had planned to try and glue it together, but instead decided to junk this to the recycle bin because I've already wasted enough time on it. My daughter is receiving a Melissa and Doug wooden stable for x-mas next week.	-1
It is supposed to snap together yet it just falls apart.  My son barely touched it and it was broken.  Cheap set.  I have found all Breyer products to be junk!	-1
Santa brought this for my animal-loving daughter last year and her frustration with the toy lead to its collecting dust. It falls apart if you so much as bump it and she enjoys moving toys from room to room. I used Superglue to hold it together, which worked reasonably well. The roof doesn't stay on at all. Since she needs to remove it for play, that's a problem, since without the roof, the structure is very weak (Superglue & all).  It's about what you'd expect for the money. I would recommend searching for a one-piece set with no assembly or a sturdier one, maybe made of wood.  I know Breyer is a classic name so I took a chance that the toy would be a better quality than it is. My daughter plays with the horses and the fence but I think after a year of "My stable broke again!" it's time to take my own advice and find something better.  ETA: We eventually resorted to super-gluing it together... and it still fell apart (within months). It went into the garbage. There are much better options out there.	-1
This was our visit to Santa yesterday... my 6 year old daughter looks at him and says, "I want horse stables, but NOT the ones you brought me last year, they fell apart!!"  and she was pissed!!!  And yes, it was this set!!  Santa was NOT HAPPY...LOL  Don't buy it, piece of junk, get the melissa and doug wooden set instead!	-1
This is a very cute stable but I wouldn't call it a toy.  It is so flimsy that there's no way to actually play with it.  Ours will be returned and I'll look for one that won't fall apart.	-1
I would consider myself a very lenient judge of toys. I've never complained when doors fall off, wings fall out, or windows & gates have to be resnapped again & again. I don't mind that- but what I do mind is buying my daughters 6 Breyer horses & stable set for her 6th birthday and within only 1 week 4 of the 6 are completely broken.... including the white horse that came with the Glamour Girls' ranch too. My girls are gentle with their toys and were ready for some "Real looking Horses." So, I bought Breyer horses and as my husband says, "Never again." 3 of the horses legs broke simply from walking them on the carpet! One of the Rider's legs snapped off just from being placed on the horse & I can't for the life of me get it back on. One of the larger horses lost all it's tail hair simply from being brushed with the brush it came with. Honestly, these toys are cheap and defective. One of the other Brands of Horses she received held up great. Now, I'm on the lookout for any more horses from any brand but Breyer. I wish I had been warned about Breyer's Quality.	-1
Very disappointed! I like the idea of having floatie vest that is compact and wouldn't take up all the room in my suitcase.  However, It was wayyy too small.  The description says for 2-3 years old, yet my son just turned 3 and is on the smaller side (30 lbs and maybe 37 inches).  I could not put it over him even after loosening the straps all the way (maybe it's all that belly...?).  The 2 bottom Velcros were also too short to reach. I think it "might" fit a toddler between 18 mos - 2 year old (still questionable).  *Also please note, the color is assorted, so you could get a bright pink one for your son, we would've still kept it if it fit but it didn't*	-1
Tipped my 22 month old granddaughter on her belly!  Not great!	-1
Baby is not supported AT ALL. like wearing NOTHING.	-1
i was so excited to try this vest after trying 3 others unsuccessfully. i bought the medium (up to 66 lbs) and could not get it on my 33 lb., 3 1/2 year old son. it took over 10 minutes to loosen & get it on him, while he cried the entire time!  the bungee cord sides are horrible - even on top of a rash guard, they were digging in his skin.  the crotch strap had to be extended to the fullest point & was still way too tight. my son is thin so I was no expecting this to be such a hassle to get on. i returned it the next day.	-1
Arrived purple. My sons said they were for girls.	-1
Cute tea set but it will all chip and break in that basket. It isn't padded and has no storage compartments. We have a broken set.	-1
I bought this set because it came with a case, and it looked cute, however the lid to the teapot broke within the first month-with no way to fix it. It's also very small in comparison to others. I would not recommend that anyone purchase it.	-1
Cute but the case broke the first day. My daughter was so sad.	-1
This is a huge disappointment. I have the Carrom shuffleboard game; it is solid, heavy, and made to last. This Skittles game feels like it's made out of balsa and particle board, crudely stapled together. Two of the corners of the frame were broken upon arrival, with sharp staples and splinters sticking out. The packaging was not damaged. It left the factory like that. Even if it were intact, I would be sending it back, because it feels like it will break if you breathe on it. Will be seeking a used one with proper build quality.	-1
I bought one somewhere else and loved it!! This one is so small so I guess it would be nice for 3-7 year old! There is only one top so everyone has to hand it off to the next person I was disappointed not good for adults or teenagers	-1
We ordered this for Christmas for our son from Santa Claus. Christmas Eve we opened it up and put it together and tested out the keys--I was expecting lovely little chimesit was truly horrible. I don't normally get bothered by noisy kids toys--but this was so bad, I could tell I wouldn't be able to handle it. It's beautifulbut so so bad. We sent it back.	-1
This rusted after own wash! I made sure it was VERY dry immediately after washing. Unfortunately you can not get all the water under the "lip" of the cups and around the teapot spout.	-1
Nice set , given to grandson for Christmas, BUT one of the cups was chipped in box and not noticed until gift was opened!	-1
disappointed so small ..I mean really small cant be used as a toddler tea set	-1
Ive had this for some time now, and now the cups and plates smell like...well rust. I think id rather go plastic, since my daughter often leaves water in these cups and sometimes they aren't dried properly. I threw it away because the smell got so bad. We loved it while it lasted tho.	-1
This set is made from the same molds as the Small World set and I here repeat the issue with the teapot being impossible to pour from properly. Expect a mess every time, so fine if your tea party is with plain water but not with anything else. I think it is frustrating for a child who is trying to pour neatly to be defeated by a badly engineered utensil. I can't pour from it without a mess either and I have been an adult a LOOOOONG time.	-1
This is a doll size tea set. It is impractical to have a tea party with it.  Very disappointed when I received it.	-1
Super cheap. Spend more and get a nice set for your baby.	-1
this is very small only for pretend play with dolls!!	-1
Everything was too small.  Need to make a little bit bigger for the older girls who would like to have a tea set	-1
I should have heeded the warnings that this was a tiny set. It was made for dolls not kids. I think Vector shrunk it....returning.	-1
Really tiny. Almost dollhouse size	-1
This set is very cute and my daughter loves it.  However, after 4-5 plays with water it has started to rust inside the tea pot.  Very disappointing.  If you do liquid-free play I'd say get this set, otherwise plastic or ceramic.	-1
This is a cute tea set, however if you are looking for a tea set that your kids can use for real drinks, keep looking!  Every time my children pour from the tea pot its contents spill everywhere!  It's a bad design.  The lid regularly falls off too.  It would be great for pretend play, but the reason I got this was so my kids could use it for real pouring and drinking.  They are so careful and yet the water still goes everywhere and the lid falls off all the time.  I've tried myself and it doesn't pour correctly for me.  It's such a shame as it looks like a great set.  I gave it two stars as even though I hate it,my kids still like it a lot..but it does make them upset when it spills..it kinda spoils their play as they feel they have done something wrong when it spills everywhere!	-1
Tiny tiny pieces. It's like a miniature tea set. Too small to be properly used. Very disappointed.	-1
This is such a bad value for the price.  First of all, in contrast to the description, it does not come in a case.  If you look at some of the other reviews, they mention the same thing.  I suppose sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't?  Very strange.  In addition, this tea set is really small.  The pictures do not depict this well.  The other thing to be concerned about is that this set is made from metal, so if your children are playing tea party, the set needs to be dried well or it will rust.  I really wanted to love this set, but it's just so misleading from the description.	-1
This tea set is tiny - made for a doll.  Even thought it is porcelain, my 2 year old daughter is too big to drink from it, and she is only 33 inches tall!	-1
I really didn't like this after purchase	-1
In this picture, it appears that this tea set lays nicely in it's storage box and even that there is a middle compartment which holds the cutlery.  In actuality, this set lays in flimsy plastic, that no little princess would feel excited to "put the basket back together" after she is done playing.  It's ugly and cheap looking and the entire set is tiny.	-1
Product arrived with a broken tea cup.  The packaging was good and was not damaged.  I believe it was likely put in broken.  My daughter loves it.  Too bad it is going to be returned.	-1
Over the last few years, these Leap Pads have come in and out of my house via various garage sales, gifts, etc..  The kids play with them for a very short time, then tire of them, and off they go to Goodwill.  So my kids like them for like a day, and that's it.  It's just another electronic toy.  The little cartridges get lost very easily and then you're stuck with books that won't work.  My kids will cuddle up with me and a book everyday, for long periods of time.  That's what little kids books are about:  bonding with those who love you while learning.  Read you child a book instead of plopping them in front of this thing.  Teach them the words with your fingers and your voice, not a stylus and a computerized talking box.  We don't need batteries to teach our kids to read.	-1
I bought this toy on an auction site well below retail prices. I really don't see what the fuss is about. I think it's a waist of plastic & paper.  The books have very limited value from an educational stand point.  If you want a sound effects box (electronic babysitter) that your child can mindlessly play with then this is the toy for you.  I normally love Leapfrog, but I really believe they missed the mark with this toy. I will be putting our toy immediately back up for auction.	-1
I was disappointed in how terribly small the tea set is. It would be perfect for dolls but not little girls( 6yrs-9yrs)  who want to have a tea party.  The painting on it was cute.	-1
This was much smaller then I expected. I didn't even give it to my daughter just ordered her a different one.	-1
This item is Cute and has good colors but it is way too small for little hands to use.  Cute - but not usable for a tea party.	-1
This was a nice idea, but much smaller than shown in advertisement.  One of the cups handle is crooked, as if it slid in glazing. I would not purchase this item again.	-1
[...]  This product does contain lead.  This is potentially harmful to your child's brain!  I am beside myself that this is being sold.  I ordered this and came across this information looking at other reviewers, now I am returning it, losing my shipping charge, surely.  I am not an overly paranoid type, but I really do not think it is worth the risk to your child!	-1
This set is sooo tiny. I expected it to be larger. The product description should specify that it is very small or show a size comparison. All it does is provide the dimensions of the tray. The carrying case is made of cardboard also which is not specified in the product description. I was disappointed.	-1
I KNOW it was my job to check dimensions but still...this thing is so little there is nothing to it.  My three year old played with it for about ten mniutes and got bored.  The print is cute but for a tea party....it needs to be at least a normal size and it was just in my opinion, a total waste of money, way too exensive for its size.  If it were bigger it may have been worth the 18 bucks I spent on it.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  Find one that has more to do and that is a bigger.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Schylling-Summer-Bug-Tin-Tea-Set/dp/B000OA83UU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Schylling Summer Bug Tin Tea Set</a>	-1
I bought this for the 2nd birthday of our neighbor's daughter.  I was fine with the fact that the tea set was made of tin, but when you lift the box, it RATTLES so loudly.  Everything is just tossing around in the little carrying case, which is made of CARDBOARD!  I'm sure the carrying case won't last too long.  Inside the carrying case, the paper looked old and some areas had rust stains from the tin tea set.  It looks SO CHEAP!  This is something you would expect to find and buy in a DOLLAR STORE!  It is that cheap looking and cheaply made.  The tea set is VERY SMALL, which is probably ok for 2 or 3 year olds.  But, I was too ashamed to give this cheap gift to our neighbor's daughter.  The other reviews all seemed really good and the product looked great online.  I really wanted to like it, but it is just a piece of junk.  DON'T BUY IT.  You will regret it!	-1
Just disappointed...I bought itfor my 4 year old but it's so little she cannot even have fun with her dolls and the tiny tiny plates keep disappearing everywhere.	-1
My petite 2-year-old daughter fits well on this seat - too bad she's not ready to potty train yet. My 3-year-old son can barely fit on the seat, much less pee without making a mess on the outside of the seat or the floor. It's a pain to pull the basin out to dump it - it always seems to stick slightly then jolt, so whatever is inside sploshes out. :( I opened it completely to clean the inside and couldn't believe all the little tight compartments inside, all of which contained urine because of the way the seat jolts when I try to remove the basin. It was a nightmare to clean completely.  The top part of the seat is supposed to fit on a normal toilet. It fits on our toilet but wobbles a lot. We tried it at my mom's house and it didn't fit AT ALL on her seat. We also brought it with us on a trip and tried it on a public toilet...wouldn't fit.  I bought this seat for less than $5 second-hand, so it was no big loss to me. However, I would NOT recommend buying this new. It was more trouble than it was worth.	-1
We purchased this because it looked sturdy and had a lid so it would be good for travel.  It is only good if you have a small toddler or are training at a very young age, The hole is really small so if you only want to train them to pee in the thing then you are ok otherwise you will have a mess to clean!  We returned it the same day we bought it!	-1
This potty has so many flaws.  For one, the opening is just tiny.  My son ended up pooping all over the seat because of that.  For boys the splash guard is a real problem.  If you don't have the splash guard on, of course he pees all out the front, but it flipped right down as my son sat down, so not only did he pee all out the front and on to the floor, he also peed on to the splash guard.  It comes apart so easily, and it doesn't go back together all that well.  And YIKES!  All the places the germs can collect!  There are so many little places for bacteria, both on the inside and outside of this potty.  We gave ours away and got the Baby Bjorn potty instead, which is awesome!	-1
The hole on this potty chair is ridiculously small.  There's no way that my son can poop and pee in the same seated position.  He has to move a bit back to pee in the potty then forward to get the poop in it.  What a hassle while he's learning potty skills!  And the pee guard is worthless.  It falls off ALL the time with just barely a tap but it is SO tall that it gets in his way when he's trying to sit down so gluing the darn thing into place isn't an option either.  This chair was a serious disappointment.	-1
The seat does not stay locked in place and moves at the slightest touch. If my son moves/wriggles while sitting on it, the seat often moves from side to side/front to back. The pee guard also comes off at the slightest touch.	-1
I bought this for my son when he was 20 mos and the top part does not fit right on the seat.  I figured that it was just the one potty, but then a friend of mine told me that she had the exact same problem!  So, the top part can be used when seated on the actual toilet, but it doesn't work as an actual potty chair!  Also, the urine guard is terrible.  First, it's very hard and it could hurt his boy parts.  Second, it doesn't stay in place.  The only thing I like about the potty chair is that it has the handles.  The stool part is even flimsy.  Hope this helps!	-1
In-laws have this potty.  It is a pain to use.  My son is constantly getting hit in the back by the potty top.  He tries to open it and if he opens to fast, then it slams shut again. Other difficult part is that you lift the whole blue/green seat part off to get the bowl to clean.  It's flimsy, and not well made. The reason it got stars from me is because I have never had it leak, and my son (26 mo) enjoys holding the handles.	-1
We have had nothing but trouble with this thing. Like other reviewers said the part that lifts up to empty the potty is not convenient. The latches on back to keep it together are very flimsy. The step stool only works when you take the potty apart and turn it upside down. The only time its convenient is if you are ready to move the seat to the adult toilet and use the step stool part as a step stool full time. But the worst part of this thing is the splash guard. My son never played with it. But once it was moved to the big toilet it would often come off and fall into the large toilet all on its own as my son was trying to get down. One day it fell off while I was taking him off the potty and I flushed before I realized it was in there. No, I didn't expect the chair to potty train my child for me but I certainly expected something that wouldn't fall apart.	-1
I got this game to use in play therapy with older kids (12-14), but found too many of the questions were too outdated. Also, there simply aren't enough questions.  If you were to play this just a few times, you'd have learned all the answers.  The money is flimsy (what else!)and a pain to manage in a short time.  This might be fun for adults, but didn't hit what I was aiming for with the kids.	-1
The item shipped and was delivered fast.  We have had similar items before, it was the end of the season and they were no longer available locally therefore I ordered it online.  When it came it was exactly as I thought it would be, they only problem was after we used it about 3 times it would no longer hold air.  As far as I am concerned it was a total waist of money.  Had I purchased it locally I would have taken it back but since I ordered it on line I threw all the paper work, packaging and information away after we opened it so I had nothing to send it back with.  Of all the things I have ordered over the years this was the first time I have been so disappointed in a product.	-1
Seemed really durable at first glance and I wrote a great review - now, after only 2 uses, it was deflated.  Tried to reinflate - no luck - it's already got a hole!  Didn't think to save the receipt :-(.  Very disappointed.  I think it may have come with a repair patch, but how in the world would you even repair it with the fabric wrapped around the tube?!	-1
After ton's of research, I finally bought this item for my 2 year old. The tube tipped over, fortunately my husband was right next to him to flip him back over.  Do not buy this. Its cheap and poorly made.	-1
I bought this for my grandson (23 pounds) and found that we couldn't use it at all.  In the kiddie pool, everytime he bent forward or reached for something, the tube flipped him over and because of it's bouyancy, held him underwater - he couldn't right himself.  This happened both when his feet were on the bottom and when he was floating in it.  Perhaps it's better suited to larger children in a standard pool where they are truly floating, but I would be cautious.	-1
The tin is very flimsy. The strap is very uncomfortable around a childs neck. I would not recommend this for anyone.	-1
I don't like the way the board or the pieces are made. None of it seems durable at all. I don't recommend it for younger children. It may be somewhat useful for ages 4+  The letters are extremely light and made of some type of light wood, I suppose. It doesn't come with any type of storage so be prepared to hunt for pieces.	-1
The letters are already falling apart. Definitely won't "last a lifetime". It's a plywood board, not solid wood and crumbled apart on several letters already (kids have been playing with it for about 2 weeks).  The color layer is a sticker and is peeling off. Letters like Z, S, X and I are only able to fit in one direction which is too difficult for young children. Would not recommend this product and am looking to return. Disappointed since I love M&D products.	-1
Our three year old has been learning his letters so thought this would be the perfect gift for him.  When I opened the Amazon package I was so disappointed in the quality of the puzzle.  There are cut marks in the main puzzle frame around one of the letters.  The letters are also not cut out with very good quality.  My son has enjoyed playing with it and putting the letters in the correct spots.  I gave it one star for the quality.  Spend a little more money and get one that is better made.	-1
dont live it , quality is not good.	-1
Pretty cheaply made product. The letters don't hold up very well to a toddler.	-1
I found that the pictures underneath were not the best choice.  For example, the letter "A" picture is a plane and the letter "J" is a jet.  Could they not have been so redundant and used another image for either one?  I think that is confusing to a toddler.  Another, for example the letter "Q" is a picture of a quail. What two year old knows what a quail is and needs to really know at that age!?  Wouldn't a picture of a quarter or perhaps a queen would be better?  I think a quarter would have been much better than a quail. The letter "L" is suposed to be a ladybug, but then there is also a picture of another uncommon bug that kinda throws it all off, like I would assume that picture is for "bugs," not a ladybug. The "W" shows a an old horse and carriage that is supposed to be a wagon.  Why not instead use a classic kids red pull wagon or something else.  Bottom line, it was not well thought out and disappointing.	-1
Don't like the letters model!	-1
Puzzle pieces don't fit very well.  And under A is a picure of an airplane but then under J is a picture of a Jet.  Kind of confusing for toddlers learning words and the alphabet.	-1
Puzzle is okay but the pieces fit awkwardly and the pictures for each letter are not very good. Not very high quality that I would expect from this brand.	-1
Horrible. The letters are not cut in straight lines. Bathe "G" looks odd.  I had another set for my first child and it was much better.  This one is better than that German one.	-1
I agree with some of the other reviewers that this is a faux Melissa and Doug product. The letters are thin; covered with stickers; and  cheaply made. I'm really disappointed by this puzzle.	-1
Not as sturdy as other Melissa & Doug puzzles.  Disappointed in the flimsy letters	-1
Didn't fit puzzles as well as I expected, especially M & D puzzles.	-1
cheap and poorly made. holds very few puzzles and only ones that are small.	-1
was missing 2 letters! i was so bummed because otherwise it was cute.  But yeah, missing 2 letters fresh out of the box.  No way it got lost, because it was just us, the box, and a big empty carton.  It was such a busy holiday season, that i never got around to trying to return it, so no experience there.	-1
My toddler loved this puzzle but I was surprised at the quality control. We received 2 of the same piece and one piece was not printed correctly and doesn't line up.	-1
I purchased this thinking it was the other alphabet floor puzzle with the good review, but this one is ten feet long and connects one to one.  I  purchased it to help my toddler learn the alphabet, but it just takes up too much floor space and it the pictures are not very fun so the alphabet part of it seems to not to come across well enough.  Quality is good if your looking for this type of puzzle.	-1
We recieved this as a present and my son was very excited to put it together.  The pictures are nice and the big size makes it fun.  As with any alphabet activities, we enjoyed practicing our letters by saying, "C is for Cow," etc.  But when we got to X we were shocked to see they put a fox. The age range for the puzzle will expect the traditional "X is for..." set up and not be looking for the letter in the final position.  They did U is for umbrella so why they felt they had to do fox for x is unclear.  We love most Melissa & Doug items, but fell that this one missed on this.  We have to keep correcting our little one that X is not for fox!	-1
I received this toy as a gift for my third child and was so excited because all of my hand-me-down toys from my other kids were getting a little worn out.  It looked so cool from the box.  It is very loud and annoying and impossible to keep together.  The mat that goes with the toy is worthless and kept coming apart from the toy mechanism.  The only thing that proved to be entertaining for my child was the stackable "blocks" that came with it.  The spinning part of the toy just frustrated the heck out of my daughter.  She wanted to stack the blocks and it was too hard for her to do on the rotating parts.  Watching the blocks fall and fly off is probably fun for some kids, but my daughter preferred to just use the blocks alone one the floor.	-1
Didn't care too much for this game.  Brought it with us when we had a group of adults on a trip. The game is a bit complicated and kind of confusing. We quickly abandoned it.	-1
First off it was sooo hard to put together and then it was cracked on the bottom so i had to send it bac and when i got the new one together it was not at all what i expectited!! The radio is horrible! - the handle that is suppose to let me push her stinks cause the front wheels go whereever they want to not where i want - and the same when she is trying to push it with her feet while she is in it. I hate it its worth a try for yourself. I def.dont think its worth the money tho.	-1
My 18 mo daughter received this for Christmas.  She loved riding in it. However, I don't understand how Little Tikes could make such a toy on wheels, and the only way in is to CLIMB in (or have a parent put you in.)  So, we could not leave the toy out for her to play with, as it was such a danger to her.  She is not yet able to climb very well, and the thing IS ON WHEELS.  We have lots of hard floors for her to fall on.  And, as so many people have already said, it totally needs a seatbelt.  We exchanged this for the original Cozy Coupe, and she loves it just as much!  She loves having a door to open and close, and the hard top prevents her from standing up.	-1
My full video review - http://www.gameboygeek.com/#!kings-corner/coue	-1
Could not figure out how to play this game.  When we went by the directions, it was boring. Would not recommend this game.	-1
This is the worst toy that my son received for his 5th birthday.  Making a basket is nearly impossible for me or him.  There is no scoring mechanism.  This toy is going in the garbage.	-1
We were looking for a solution to hold the tracks together.  Our 2 year old kept knocking the pieces over.  This is merely a riser.  Not a clip of any kind.  Kind of pricey too.	-1
Not a bad product, but I find my son tends to tip back the wagon too much as he is walking.  The wagon just seems a bit too light, even with a few toys tossed inside.  My boy prefers the tonka truck walker better, it doesn't tip over and he can get rough with it without any worries.	-1
This wobbler is adorable to look at, but not well built at all. But, maybe ours is just defective. Here's why it sucks.  It tips over way too easily, even if you load it down with toys. The handle is metal and is not so good for curious little teeth. The mechanism for tightening the wheels, screws directly into soft plastic. It cracked the first time I tried to tighten the brakes, and rendered them useless.	-1
This toy actually has gotten a "thumbs down" by the Oppenheim Toys Portfolio (that just cracks me up). The music is a little too loud; it just doesn't have that awesome spin action that I remember as a kid. Seems pretty tough. We got it for free- if you are in the market for one, I would pursue other alternatives.	-1
I remember enjoying these as a kid and our family had one for years.  When some gave us this one I thought it was pretty neat but WOAH is that music LOUD, there is no volumn control and while I'm not a prude and want only quiet toys, contrary, I want toys that will stimulate young minds so I don't mind noise but this thing IS LOUD!  So I put some tape over the 2 speakers (LOOKS like there are 4 but music only comes from 2) I put tape over the speakers and wah-la just the right volume now.  But I read why people rated this negatively.  And I am glad, I thought it was just my imagination---but it's TRUE, this must be smaller than the original version I grew up with.  At 18 months I tried to help my daughter spin on it yet for her to sit on it her chest would rub the steering wheel.  By 2 she could spin it herself but would risk a tumble with each turn as she tried to balance herself on the small base and still manuever the steering wheel.  A big turnoff is portability.  To pick this up and move it you have to hold the bottom end otherwise it falls off the handle, perhaps it was meant to screw in and ours is missing a screw?  Anyway, if someone wants to buy one cheap then I know where you can get one haha.	-1
I really wish they had regular sit and spins without any musical abilities.  The music that plays on this toy is worse than nails on a chalkboard, I immediately took the batteries out.  My daughter likes it, and there is no sound (thank goodness).	-1
The classic sit 'n spin was so wonderful!  PLEASE TRY THIS IN THE STORE BEFORE YOU BUY!  Don't be fooled, as we were, into thinking the 'music' was not too loud.  We tried the music in the store (TRUs) before buying, but discovered, when in use at home, that a toy store environment must be very loud.  In addition to the VERY loud, obnoxious music (even our 3-yr. old daughter still covers her ears, and that's with clear packing tape over the speaker), it is very, very easy for children to fall when they step on this toy (and that's the 1st way they usually try to get on it).  As a consequence, VERY CLOSE SUPERVISION is needed for playdates and children under the age of 5.  Children also tend to lean backward while trying to use arms to spin, and this often results in the SNSpin toppling over.  Our child's lighweight (3 yrs., 30 lbs.), but heavier friends have experienced the same high-risk issue.  BUY IT WITHOUT THE MUSIC, if you can find it.	-1
it's ok, my grand baby likes it but it does not convert properly.  I am very disappointed.	-1
This product is great in theory, but is much too small for my average-sized child. Cute but not too functional.	-1
Neither of my children (up to 2 yrs) were interested in this. Poor design. The only use we got out of it was for one of them (at about 6 mo)to sit next to it and play with it. Otherwise, they never used it. It is not ride-able at all! Not sturdy enough as a walker. Too bad, it's cute! No educational value. Not worth the money! I gave mine away for free...couldn't bring myself to sell it to anyone. I would NOT recommend it!	-1
This toy as a ride on spreads a little kids legs too far apart, so they can't really push themselves along on it and its also unhealthy for soft, developing hip joints.  It is also easy to slip off the sides.  The wheels don't turn very well either while the weight of the child is on it.  As a walker, this toy doesn't turn at all, and falls over easily, which was very frustrating for my kids who were learning to walk.  There are better ride ons and walkers out there, so I would suggest getting something else if you are serious about an enjoyable walker or ride-on.  If you have an older toddler who is already a steady enough walker, he may enjoy pushing it around and crashing it into things and playing with all the touchy features.  Mine made it thru 3 kids and the only thing that wore out were the stickers.  Its very durable in that respect.  But my kids were very petite, so by the time they were able to comfortably push themselves around in the car position, they had lost interest in riding on it.  I would actually suggest the Pottery Barn metal toy shopping cart (or similar product) as THE BEST WALKER you can buy a child.  It is heavy and sturdy enough not to topple over, even when empty!  And it is a breeze to push and turns on a dime with its 4 castor wheels that can rotate 360 degrees!  I bought it for my child who had muscle coordination problems and hypotonia, because he needed something more like a real walker and none of the walker toys on the market were stable or maneuverable enough for his special needs.  But I've leant it to 2 other babies who used it to learn to walk since then, and now its back teaching my son's baby sister to walk.  :)  Greatest walking toy PERIOD.	-1
This toy seems to be a good idea, but doesn't perform.  In walker mode it tips too easily for learners and in ride-on mode the child's foot gets stuck on the little antenna on the back.  Takes up space and never got played with.  I have twins and babysit triplets and still it didn't get much use.	-1
I don't use the car portion because it's too small for my children (my 14 month old is 33 inches tall). The walker seems better on carpet, but slides too much on hardwood floors. There isn't enough space between the base of the toy and the baby's foot so the walker part isn't really functional either. I'm going to have to give this toy up.	-1
This toy is cheap,unstable,boreing and doesnt encourage walking. If anything This toy is ok for the ride on function, but definitely useless as a walker. My 11 month old doesnt even exspress an interest in this toy. He likes to sit on it and play hide and seek with the back compartment for about two minutes at a time and thats about it. The walker is so light weight that its just a bad fall waiting to happen. If you do purchase this you should only use it on carpet. Really this thing is nothing but a dust collector and im sorry i waisted the money.	-1
Our now 10 month old got this toy for Christmas, and it looked fun at first.  However, once he was at point when he was mobile and pulling up on things to "cruise", he kept trying  to walk with this and it kept flipping back.  It is just very lightweight and doesn't really support leaning on the handle.  Also, the wheels don't turn very well, more like slide.  So, it definitely would be better on carpet than hardwood, but still not good.  After falling once and bumping his head, and then falling a second time and having the toy hit him in the mouth, we gave up.  As a ride on, it is safer, but it is pretty small.  Our 10 month old is pushing the limits (he's on the average to small side).  A disappointment.	-1
We received this as a gift when our daughter was 11 months old. She was already at that time quite proficient at "cruising", that is, walking assisted by furniture, etc.  She was basically walking on her own two weeks after we  got this.  I was hoping it would be a big help to her, and fun, until she  got to the point where she could walk steadily on her own (you know, around 18 months or so).  The thing is, this toy, as a "walker" is very poorly designed: the wheels go so fast when they push it that is just flies out from under her every time she tried to push it. She quickly lost any interest in it.  Even as a "car" toy, the same problem.  Many walker toys have a simple mechanism that prevent the wheels from turning too fast so that baby does fall on her face as toy shoots out from under her across the floor. I really can't see paying more than $3 for this at a yard sale.  It  is, in my humble opinion it is an overpriced piece of Made-in-China plastic JUNK. An insult to the land-fill it will inevitably end up in. No thanks!	-1
I really didn't like this toy.  It is nonfunctioning as both a walking toy and a riding one.  As a walker, there isn't enough room for a child's feet when they are walking with it in front of them.  As a rider and walker, it doesn't roll very well.  I just didn't like this at all.  It also doesn't have as many activities on it as many other walking and riding toys.  I would not recommend anyone buy this.	-1
This toy has been through both of my kids now and I've had the same experience with both: this toy is just fine as a "riding/scooting" toy but is terrible as a "learn to walk" toy.  The problem is there is very little to no resistance in the wheels so as soon as you begin to push on the handle, it goes rolling.  This is useless for a child that still needs some help balancing as he/she begins to learn how to walk since as soon as the kid puts any weight on it, it shoots forward.  This is probably a larger problem on my hardwood floors but I can't see it being significantly better on carpet.  The good side of the toy is that it is well sized for a riding toy.  The handle is place well and my kids were/are able to get on and off easily by themselves.	-1
I wouldn't recommend buying this. It doesn't roll well on the floor at all. My daughter (1 year old) was sitting on it with my husband calling for her to come to him. She couldn't push it, but ended up falling off cause it wouldn't roll. Don't buy this one.	-1
We bought this for our daughter when she was around 11 months and standing but not walking.  She used it mainly in her room on carpet.  The toy is really light so in the "push mode" she managed to build up a lot of speed in a small space.  A couple of times she tipped it over.  She really seemed to prefer to push around a jumbo sized pampers box.  Now she is walking she hardly looks at this toy.  She is tall so when she does sit on it in "car mode" she is too big to push forward - she can only push backwards which seems to get old really fast.  Considering all this and the amount of space this toy takes up, if I had to do it over I would probably pass.	-1
I bought this for my daughter at 9 mos. She was already pulling up and cruising on furniture. I thought this would be helpful for her to get around the other areas of the house with my help. Unfortunately, it's very unsturdy and the wheels go quickly. There isn't any resistance for beginning walkers, so they will lean on the walker and it will shoot forward. I thought using it on the carpet (rather than our wood floors) might help, but no difference.  By reading the description, it sounds like a great transition toy. I think you should save the money and just use an overturned box or laundry basket. Same effect.  The only upside is that she enjoys the car mode when I push her. Perhaps she will grow into this toy once she walks independently. However, I think that defeats the purpose and description of this toy. It'll sit and gather dust until she wants to ride on it.	-1
I was surprised at so many positive reviews for this product.  It is cute but the design was terrible.  the back wheels come out too far so our daughter was constantly tripping over them.  also, as a scooter the front bars roll forward so there is little room for the child to sit, plus not back so children easy slip off the back.  also hard to get on the scooter with the little purple thing sticking out of the back.  we have a tall child so maybe that is why.	-1
I bought this walk n ride for my youngest when she was almost ready to walk (about 11 months).  She wouldn't fool with it too much but instead use the shopping cart I had when my oldest was young.  She preferred the shopping cart even though it moved more quickly but she would always reach for the shopping cart first.  I still have the walk n ride but its sitting in the backyard.  I seem to remember her feet tripping on the wheels while using as a walker.  I think there are better walkers out there.	-1
Bought this for my 13 month old as she has started cruising. Turn out the walker is so light, she could not hold on to it and walk without falling forward. She would play it for less than 5 minutes and not take a second look at it for the rest of the day.  Overall, I would not recommend this for toddlers learning to walk.	-1
It took about 30 min to put together. Not a pain, but not a snap. The toy is overall just OK: durable, but too lightweight for baby to use independently. The wheels are too slippery when revolving and we slowed it down to baby speed by putting cardboard near the axle (which isn't a permanent solution, but...). The thing only goes straight whereas my daughter zigzags and wanders, so she only walk a few steps with it and leaves it by the wayside. Mostly it gets in the way of her cruising the house and we end up tucking it under the livingroom table. I don't doubt some children love it, but it has not been a favorite in our household. Something sturdier, heavier would be a little better if your child likes this sort of thing.	-1
This toy is somewhat cheaply made. It hasn't broken, but it is light and flimsy. The wheels are just plastic on plastic and don't turn well. The concept of a non walking baby walking behind this in the upright position is not a good one. They can't do that. and after they walk they won't either. My grandson just pushes it like a giant car, from the side. and crawls up to it and pushes it again. and that is about it. Not much to do for a baby.	-1
While I have no real problems with the toy itself other then the fact its made in China (which is why I would NEVER have bought it on my own) we received this as a gift that my in-laws purchased at a charity event (it was not purchased here at Amazon). When we went to assemble the toy a couple of pieces were missing, the front handle & the decals for the "spinner". I went online & found parts were readilly available through Hasbro (they make Playskool toys). I ordered the parts & they came in a few weeks then the "fun" began - the dolts shipped me the wrong decal sheet which I figured could be easily remedied with a single call yet here we are several months later & half dozen phone calls to their customer NO service dept. Every time I call I get a new excuse (lie?) as to why the replacement hasn't even been shipped yet, you would think this would be a simple fix NOT! I think my wife has the reason we haven't gotten the decals pinned down - they probably have to come from China! Anyway I know it seems petty but when it comes time to give the toy to a needy child or charity (which we do with all of the baby items we no longer use) it would be really nice to give it to them 100% complete.	-1
My daughter received this as a birthday gift when she turned one.  The walk-behind part of the toy is fine.  When you change it over to a ride-on toy is where we had a problem.  The toy is shaped so that the sides flare out in the back.  It runs over my daughter's feet.  If the sides had been straight I think the toy would have been fine.  The concept was great but I'm not sure they tested it.	-1
We were very excited to receive the Playskool Walk n' Ride as a gift for our (at the time) 11 month old dd.  She wasn't quite walking yet and couldn't wait for her to be able to use the Walk n' Ride to keep her on her feet. We did not find it that difficult to put together, however it did take some time (I might suggest putting together before actually giving it as a gift to child) - dd was uninterested by the time we finished putting it together. Our daughter was able to push toy without the problem that some other reviewers listed as "not enough room for the feet".  She did however have some difficulty turning the toy in a different direction.  Because it was so heavy, she had to use all her might to turn sideways.  And do to it's bulkiness, we found that she could only play with it in large open areas.  Since she was a winter baby, this meant moving the kitchen table to the side of the dining room, just so she could play. As she progressed we thought maybe we'll give the "ride" part a try.  I was equally disappointed with this feature.  Due to the "bulkiness" of the toy she had a difficult time swinging her little legs over the toy to get on and off.  Also when she sat on it correctly the handle was so close to her chest it really didn't look comfortable and didn't allow for her to get much leverage to push the toy forward. On a positive note, some of the sight-touch-sound features  (such as the flexible antenna, spinning drum, clicking gear) did provide some pleasure for dd. Also, the toy seem to be sturdy enough that dd very seldom tipped it over. All-in-all I would save your money on this one.	-1
I am sorry but I have to write a review again on this....Most parents already have the common sense to assist your child when starting out with this toy and supervise them with it....that does not need to be told. Bottom line is that this toy [stinks] in my opinion! My daughter who is 10 months old and walking along furniture and everrything was walking with this toy ( WHILE BEING SUPERVISED...THANK YOU ) and next thing we knew the walker fell sideways and landed on top of her! It rolls too too easily and we have decent carpeting here too. This purchase was a mistake! I am sorry I bought it. There are much sturdier walkers out there and also equipped with better activities than this one!	-1
We rec'd our set of tracks and individual pieces on Sunday. Now, wednesday morning one of thsee Brio pieces is broken straight along the grain of the wood. I want to replace the wood portion but it's got some kind of antitamper triangle-head screw. Super glue? No bond. This is a really crap piece of plastic and brittle wood for the price. We don't have a big budget for toys and now I'm pissed we wasted any of it on this.	-1
Ive heard such great things about this game and I love the idea of the game.  BUT they changed the number placement on the board of the new version and it makes the endless loop very very frustrating that we have to change the rules to the game.  And now Im seeing that they have corrected this error and the new boards with the new version the numbers in the endless loop now line up.  How do I get a replacement board without the error????  (Also from reading other reviews  I notice that other customers have the same complaint about the new version and its not just me.)	-1
The game arrived promptly and looks like it would be fun and educational - except that the operational die was missing when we opened the box. We will try drawing pieces of card stock with the operation signs printed on them, but this is a real disappointment.	-1
The new board (the one with the round boulders for spaces, vs. old board with squarish spaces) makes it just about impossible to exit the "endless loop." They have changed the placement of the "5" and "3" spaces within the loop--previously, landing on one of these spaces would (unless you got a minus 3) guarantee your exit (in addition to landing exactly on the exit space), meaning you have a significant chance of being able to exit the loop on any given turn. Now, however, the "5" and "3" spaces will never land you on the exit--so they are pointless! There's almost no chance of landing exactly on the exit space on any given turn, which DRASTICALLY lengthens the game. The game has gone from fun to FRUSTRATING. And isn't the whole point of this to make math fun??  Our "solution" to this so far has been to just ignore the rule of landing exactly on the exit space, treating the exit space as any old space and ignoring the whole loop idea. This makes the game super short, but that's better for my 4 year old and she still gets addition/subtraction practice without the torture of drawing the game out for hours. I may end up taking a sharpie to the board and changing the placement of the 3 and 5 spaces to where they are SUPPOSED to be, to make it more playable.  If Learning Resources will either correct their game board or send me the older version of the board that actually makes sense, I will update my review with additional stars, as I think it's a great game otherwise. How did this major flaw make it all the way to production?  Also, I noticed Learning Resources commented on another review recently, stating that the only updates they made to the board were artistic. That is patently false and is the difference between a one and five star game/review for me.	-1
Not very fun.	-1
My 5-year-old daughter was not excited about this game at all.  We played it once.  Pretty boring.	-1
I bought this game to help my 6-7 year old with simple addition and subtraction. The game is kind of silly and really did not help.	-1
Played this game once with my 5-year-old.  It was boring for both of us.	-1
I have played hundreds of different games, and the game play for this one is one of the worst.  It has too few playing spaces on the board, it has paper bills but almost none are used, there is no excitement in playing, almost all luck in who wins so little thinking is involved, each timed played is about the same, no interaction (play) between players, and there does not seem that any leaning can be accomplished.  The quality is good, and the plastic coins can be used for something else.	-1
I went to open this box and found that I had received the Canadian version of this game...with Canadian money.  Nothing on the site says or shows that this will have Canadian money....I will seek to get the American money version as I am most upset about this.  I sure hope I won't have to pay to return the product so that I can get the correct version!!	-1
Hard for kids to remember all the rules and read the cards/understand the meaning. Meant for older children. My 7 year old and I played this once and he said it was boring and he loves Math!	-1
bought it when y gramdson was a few months old-he is 3 now-still loves it and his 1 1/2 year old sister loves it-has taken quite a beaten ans still looks and sounds new-I would buy this for all new babies (and I am very picky-its a great toy) Thank you asap seller will do business with you all the time	-1
My daughter got this for her birthday and she loved it, but within a month the purple button faceplate snapped off and there was no way to fix it.	-1
I don't remember ordering this and it keeps appearing here-it looks ok, that's all I can say.	-1
Horrible !! Read the review. I should have. This is cheap and doesn't work . Thank you Amazon for being amazing and returning it	-1
Wish there's am option for not too loud button. It's too loud.	-1
this item stopped working shortly after the child got it.  not a good value.	-1
Annoying. No volume and songs selection is hard. Get something else	-1
Sound is disappointing. I can't recognize violin in this digital sound, piano sound is somewhat ok. Wonder how anyone can say that sound is pleasant even for adults. This is going back.	-1
Cute toy. Love the music but it's way too loud. There's no volume button and it's piercing sound. Would not recommend.	-1
Music sounds weird and tinny compared to my older version of the toy.	-1
Doesn't fold well with the money in it but it's cute	-1
The wallet doesn't fold with the money in it and even then the Velcro doesn't stick well. It will likely be in the donations bin soon.	-1
Music wasn't as great as I thought it would be.  Probably because it is a remake of the original, as the reviews indicated.	-1
I am surprised by the decent reviews on this wallet.  It barely closes when you put the money or the cards in it.  It closes fine when it's empty but it's totally unusable with stuff in it.  Hate it.	-1
I sent it back. Loud and kind of annoying...	-1
Good game gone bad. The design of this is really poor. The little animals aren't pegs that sit securely. Instead they rest in little shallow wells so they fall over all the time.	-1
This is a very tiny version of the original game.  It may be my fault, but I was expecting it to be much larger.	-1
Had this game as a child, over 60 now, and purchased it for our granddaughter.  The pieces are much smaller now making it very difficult,thus not much fun, for younger children. Even adults who remember playing this game are not impressed with this "new" one.	-1
Wallet is very stiff.  Money is fine and credit cards.  Nothing special about this toy.  Better off purchasing a cheap wallet.	-1
My son always goes into my purse to grab my wallet and go through my cards. Although I liked the money from an educational standpoint, I really wanted the fake credit cards for him. It didn't matter to me that they were made of paper as I planned to laminate them. It stinks that the product I received had no credit cards and only money. It's too much trouble to return--and I've already laminated the bills, but it kind of stinks. Oh well. I guess I will take some of my old/expired cards and put them in there for him.	-1
My son wanted a wallet of his own. At the time, this had good ratings. This could not even fit into an adults back pocket. My child enjoys throwing the plastic coins around, but other than that, it has not interested him. The wallet is poorly made, the coins are cheap, the money is flimsy paper and the id and credit card is the thinnest cardboard you could imagine. If you actually put the coins in the wallet the zipper breaks. It is ugly as well. Buy something else.	-1
The pieces fall over too easily which ruins the game.  In addition, the playing board is just all around poorly designed. I don't understand how anyone could give this game a high rating. I loved playing Mastermind with my daughter years ago and thought this would be a fun starter game for my grandson who is 5 1/2.  All it did was frustrate both of us.	-1
Charged it up.  Only last for a few minutes of use	-1
It's power wheels so it works but it doesn't last long at all I'm wondering why sell a replacement if it does last but less than 30 mins	-1
We had this toy and returned it in 24 hours. I wanted a xylophone for my daughter who asked for one at age 2. This was a poor example of a xylophone.  There are 2 keys that are the same length and therefore play the same note.  The string for the mallet is so short you can hardly enjoy hitting the keys.  It's durable and colorful, but that's not enough for parents to endure the shrill noise that comes from playing it. Little Tikes needs to go back to the drawing board on this one.	-1
At first I felt it is amazing with music, but soon I found out how hard it is to press for a kid.  You simply can not press in the middle to get it to sing, the button are glued on one side and require pressing on the other end. It is definitely not an easy task for kids especially if they are 2 years or below.  I am inert on synthesized music, but music is not as pleasing, but two level controls add some control to reduce volume. The 3 sequences in orchesta mode (activated by tapping the orchesta side in quick succession) would give different sets of compositions.  The cube itself is heavy and might hurt little feet if it is dropped from the hands.	-1
Disappointed... this battery lasted less than a year even though it was only used a few times. Just had the battery tested and even straight off the charger barely has power. We were about to throw our Jeep away because we through there is no way our new battery could be bad already. Very disappointing as it was not cheap!	-1
FYI- This toy is hard plastic and very heavy! Contrary to the product description, there is not a single soft piece on it. I would be very wary about giving it to any young child and I am astounded that the box lists the age recommendation as 0+.  An accident with this toy is likely to lead to tears and probably a few bruises.  EDIT: Despite my comments above, which are all still true, my 9 month old son loves this toy. I supervise his playtime with the toy because of the reasons outlined in my former post, but he loves pushing the buttons and watching the lights. In terms of how much he likes playing with it, it was a good purchase.	-1
Short story: A favorite with my little girl, while it lasted. I went through 3 of these, with the best one lasting only 3 weeks. They each stopped working, and will almost never play music anymore. The speaker quality is so-so, but the music itself sounds like a midi from an old computer or cell phone. It does NOT sound anything like real instruments, so it gets on my nerves a bit after hearing the music repeatedly. Long story: I can't imagine why there are so many positive reviews for this toy. It stopped working after a few weeks, so I bought another one. It also stopped working! So, I sent a complaint to Munchkin, and their response was they would be happy to consider fixing the old cube, but only if I first sent them a video to verify that it was not working, and then shipped it back to them at my expense! Hardly worth the effort for a toy that cost less than $20. I was determined to discover the "mystery" of why so many sources (magazines, online reviewers, etc) were raving about the cube, plus my baby girl liked it a lot, so I gave it one more chance. Based on older reviews here on Amazon, which claimed that the previous generation of Mozart cubes had better sound quality, I went on eBay and bought the "old" version, which was manufactured by a different company. It worked fine at first (and sounded exactly like the new cube, which busted the other reviewers theories), but guess what? Within less than a week, it also stopped working. I can only assume this company is paying big bucks for all these positive reviews, because this toy clearly has durability issues.	-1
There are currently 61 people out there who have given this toy 1 star (62 counting me!) and if you think about it, that is a lot of people! This toy is junk. You will notice that almost all of the 1 star reviews say the same exact thing. This toy sounds like the batteries are dying, even with brand new high quality batteries. I would describe is as a warped sound. It's horrible. And not only that, but my baby was actually able to break off one of the buttons!! The purple flute button is completely removed from our toy, so it is obviously going in the trash now. I actually called the company to complain, and I was told I would have to ship the product to them myself, and then wait for them to look at it and decide what to do. Poor customer service, poor quality toy, horrible sound. Please choose something else!	-1
Sound too small, the contact is not good	-1
This toy seemed very well liked and is recommended on many toy homepages in the Top Ten Toys. I had high hopes but my little boy just doesn't seem interested. We received it early on and I think he liked the sounds of it somewhat. He is now almost 14 months and doesn't really play with it unless he is prompted by  me. Even then he'll only shortly press some buttons and then usually starts picking it up and throwing it. This thing is heavy for a little person and I'm afraid that it could hit his foot or smash through our french doors. I thought it might just take him a little while and that he would be interested as he grows older but so far we could have done without it.	-1
Doesn't hold a charge for longer than 30 mins. Then it has to be charged for 14 hours after every use!	-1
We got these for our 3 year old and much to my dismay, the sticks lose their capacity to lock in with the round pieces after one use. Now they can be inserted but they fall right out. I am really disappointed in the quality and value of the toy.	-1
Not sure where the 5 stars are coming from but the quality of these Tinkertoys are no way they were when we were kids.  Some holes too big, not drilled deep enough, holes too big so pieces fall out.  Quality control is awful and will not buy again.  Note 'Made in China' which may be where the quality has gone.	-1
way too easy - game is over in seconds - only good for very young children	-1
Borning toy and my son was over it the minute he opened it up. Music is nice but the buttons are hard to press for a child so be ready to sit there doing it for them. Given the age that a kid outgrows this, you won't have much use for this very long.	-1
Who is very chatty and outgoing. He's five months old now. It startles him and made him cry a few times. Decided it was a bit too 'manic' for him. Maybe when he's a bit older.	-1
This music cube is a great idea, but unfortunately the sound quality is terrible. The violin doesn't sound at all like a violin. Overall it's very tinny and hard to listen to.	-1
I don't typically like writing negative reviews but I can't say we're happy with our purchase. We purchased this product in November as a replacement for a jeep we have for our daughters. After the first week or two I noticed it would die (after fully charged) within 30 minutes of use. I finally got around to purchasing a new charger this past month assuming that since it was a new battery, maybe the charger wasn't charging properly. After trying the new charger with this new battery, we are still experiencing the same issue of dying within 30 minute. We're disappointed, as are our girls. The first battery we had that came with the jeep lasted at least 2-3 years and this one unfortunately didn't ever work properly and at this point it is two late to return/replace.	-1
Died within a month of use. Not used heavily, used as a backup. I'm looking for another option for a back up battery.	-1
I love that there is an off switch, and it would be very difficult for a baby to turn it on.  My baby received this as a Christmas gift, and she likes it quite a bit, hence the second star.  But why, oh why, didn't they put a volume switch on this thing though?!  My older children like to turn this on to play with their little sister, and it is ok for the first few minutes, but it is so darned LOUD, I'm practically loosing my mind.  I have to take it away, so what is the point of having a toy that gets forgotten about in a cupboard somewhere?  As for good points, there are lots of colors obviously, and baby can choose just one instrument or the whole orchestra sha-bang.  The individual instruments don't REALLY sound authentic, but it was a nice try. The musical arrangement was a nice choice, too.  But please MUNCHKIN, for the sanity of future parents receiving this as a gift, put a volume control on it!!!  If you are looking for a great gift for a parent, seriously consider&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Playskool-Busy-Poppin-Pals-Colors-May-Vary/dp/B00005N9EE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Playskool Busy Poppin' Pals (Colors May Vary)</a>, it's lasted through 3 kids, six years, and still going strong.  It's nice and quiet, too.	-1
Looked new but it won't even hold a charge. So aggravating. Should have just bought one here in town.	-1
We got this for a childrens power wheels. It did not fit and wasn't returnable.	-1
Although our special needs grandchild can hit the squares to produce music and puts his ear to the cube, the sounds are poor. We thought the batteries were weak but replacements did not change the sound. Sorry we did not return it.	-1
