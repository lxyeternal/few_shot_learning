While the filtering material is very effective the ring that supports the top of the bag will RUST! A big no-no.  The manufacturer would have been a lot smarter if some form of plastic was used as the insert instead of the metal.  Big problem, considering that these are supposed to filter things out and not add to the water or other liquid being filtered.	-1
Legit worked well . The water looks very clean	1

Good Quality	1
Purchased 2" components.  Used for an assembly in-line with my pool pump.  Installed 2 months ago and NO rust (just enough chromium to do the job).  Pipe threads were correctly formed (just a bit sharp).  This piece mated easily with the other components. Very good price.	1
Everything as promised!!!!	1
Fine.  Nothing extra ordinarily crappy or awesome about this item.	1
threads ok not great	1

I used these for a RV sewage drain at ground level in the yard where the RVs and trucks can drive over it.  This is very strong and nice quality.  I'm happy.	1
Seems very well made.  Stainless can be hard to thread, and get the threads clean and sharp.  The threads on this elbow are clean and precise.  If threading to other Stainless fittings, be sure to use sealant that lubes the threads.  Stainless doesn't rust the way standard steel fittings do, but it can tend to gall the threads if installed and removed more than once.  The threads also seem to be 'deeper' than some cheaper fittings.  It might not matter to some, but I like that it has an extra thread or two to engage the pipe.  In my opinion, that makes it easier to seal. Well made, precise, and seems strong.	1
Replacement parts. Exactly what I needed.	1
Needed to cover swing chains, worked great with a heat gun.	1
The product itself is quality, exactly what you're looking for... except this 1" ID listing as measured in person is 1.75" instead. So, not useable for my purposes. This is my second order and I've seen 4 spools mis-labeled (not by Amazon but by Insultab) as 1" now.  UPDATE: After some googling, it looks like the ID (inner-diameter) is measured when the tube is expanded in a circle, not flat. This is misleading for a layman, especially since the tube is shipped flat in a spool. So, this listing actually is for tube that has a 1" ID by industry terminology. But the "flat ID" is closer to 1.75".	-1
was a bit scratched - but for the price- i'd do it again.	1
Aluminum Rectangular Bar 1/4 x 60  As others have noted, aluminum bars 6101 T61 have fully rounded edges -- see Customer Image.  The 60" bar came in a very stiff (1/4" thick walls) cardboard tube that completely protected the aluminum.  Amazon sells this size with squared off sides if your project requires that.  This aluminum bar was perfectly flat & straight, had a smooth finish, and is top quality.  It is not polished; as the description says, there are fine "mill lines" made when the bar was formed.  Photo of latched fan door (for a generator shed) shows these bars as reinforcement aluminum.	1
Excellent extrusion very high quality!	1
I needed an aluminum bar to be part of a diode cooling fan. I needed it to be wide enough to disperse the heat, while not too long; and preferably not too expensive. Most sites offer them at lengths too long for me to handle (eg: 12ft bars), and I'd have to cut off most part of the strip anyway.  I paid just over $4, for a strip 12 x 3 x 1/4". It feels really solid, harder than I expected.  It serves it's purpose as to disperse the heat from the power diodes, and was easy to install.  I could have easily gone with half it's size, unfortunately this was the smallest sample they got. Great for performing tests on, when you later want to buy larger bars.  In the length they have rounded off edges. In the width, the edges are cut, not even filed off, and sharp.  The sample I got was 12 1/8" x 3" x 1/4"; so they gave me 1/8" leeway! :-)	1
These guys are great.  You get what you see, quickly and great quality.	1

Nice tap kit, works.	1

Great tape, especially handy around the barn to tape horse hoof protectors on without worrying about them coming off in the pasture.	1
Very good deal and met my needs!!	1
The 12 sizes of fiber washers in this assortment should satisfy most needs .  However, they are made of thinner material than most fiber washers I've seen , and are also fairly narrow .  In some cases,  the thin and narrow dimensions would be desirable .  But, they also may be more fragile than thicker fiber washers.  I compressed one of the 5/16 inch washers between a bolt and a nut, and the washer seemed to compress a normal amount.  In my opinion, if the two surfaces are parallel and smoothly machined , a thin washer is fine. If, however, the surfaces are less than ideal, a thicker washer ( or two thin washers ) may be a better idea.	1
Exactly as advertised	1
A good assortment in a nice case, and the screws are high quality.  I would however like longer screws included.  These are strictly set screws.	1
If anyone is thinking of getting any item frim this vender!!! don't worry fast and easy....... I had no problem with the speed of delivery or placing the order.	1
Great product for the price.	1
These are _terrible_. I've been using them for a day and I hate them. The caps don't seal well, so often times I find myself squeezing and the flow is irregular. there is some sort of joint between the bottle and the nozzle that also leaks at the top, and causes drops to roll down the nozzle and drip on things, which is _terrible_ if you're doing lab work and the outside of the nozzle has dust and hair statically stuck to it, because it gets washed down into what you're washing.  I will be returning these if I can.	-1
Other reviewers complained about their dripping due to vapor pressure pushing out the contents.  This is true.  I solved it, to my liking, by drilling a tiny hole in the cap for the ones that have alcohol or acetone in them.  When I spray, I just put a finger over the hole.  With the hole in the cap, they do not drip.  The ones with water, do not drip, even without the hole.  I ordered a second set.  One can also drill out the outlet a bit and get a better flow.	1
They "nailed it" with this one.  Great value	1
Good product, Good price	1
yes	1
Whats to not like?	1
Whats to say it's a brass nipple.	1
good product sold at a fair price	1
worked perfectly	1
works great	1
Worked well	1
It is aite.	1
Love the red bronze- it polishes up nice	1
Used this to extend my air compressor outlet, exactly as described.	1
It came in a hilariously long (but very tough) tube. The aluminum rod cuts and shapes easily for my use. Rigid in shorter pieces, but when long, can flex quite a bit. Just know what you're getting.	1
did what I expected it to do	1
Decent price, straight. No markings to indicate COO, by the finish quality it is probably foreign. Machined well	1
I had to spend a good while sanding it down in order to get some 1" machined pieces to slide down it without getting stuck, but as a reviewer correctly pointed out to me, this is mill finish. Other than that, not much to say... It's just a 6061 aluminum unpolished rod.	1
product OK	1
nice quality threads are clean and burr free	1
Works great as a plug for pneumatic tools/manifolds.	1
A well made plug, the manifold i was capping off was poorly done so it was hard to tell if this was awesome or amazing.	1

Decent quality clear vinyl tubing. The size and length were exactly as described.	1
The surface was smoother than I thought it was going to be but worked out good in the end.	1
On time and as advertised.  Perfect for what I need.	1
It's decently made and appears to work good enough for my purpose.  For anyone who cares, it's clearly marked MADE IN CHINA.	1
So far so good	1
Worked Great	1
Good quality, well packaged.  What else can I say, it wire rope.	1
good brush	1
Worked great combined with a drill to clean out corners of an old cast iron grate. One brush lasted about 20 minutes of continuous use on cast iron, which is probably fair. Great for detail work. But this is an expendable tool you will toss after a few uses, not a permanent item you add to your drawer of bits.	1
I purchased this attachment for my drill to clean the inside of copper fittings and it really gets the job done.  The quality is excellent and I expect this to last for years.  One word of caution, however.  Since the steel bristles are exposed be sure to wear gloves and safety glasses when you use it.  Any time you use a brush like this in a power tool you run the risk of a bristle flying off.  Getting one in a hand or eye will not make your day.	1
I use these for storing board game components. 4mil is nice and thick. Haven't had one split yet.	1

Perfect size and sturdy	1
Nice little bags at a decent price (when I purchased them from another seller PRIME), and reasonable quality.  I use these with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Find-It-Tabbed-Index-Cards-3-x-5-Inches-White-48-Pack-FT07215/dp/B00CXI2MD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Find-It Tabbed Index Cards, 3 x 5 Inches, White, 48-Pack (FT07215)</a>&nbsp;to organize discreet electronic components.  They fit perfectly inside the bags, and keep my resistors, caps, diodes, tact switches, etc, from randomly falling all over the place.  For Static-sensitive components I use the above index cards with:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/JACKYLED-Pack-of-50-10X15cm-3-9X5-9inches-Antistatic-Resealable-Bag-for-HDD-and-Electronic-Device/dp/B00P902NME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">JACKYLED Pack of 50 (10X15cm/3.9X5.9inches) Antistatic Resealable Bag for HDD and Electronic Device</a>&nbsp;instead.  I DO prefer the clear baggies, as it's easier to read the index cards at a glance.	1
work well	1
Bought these multiple times. Very happy with them. The 4 Mil thickness is a must have and cant be beat for durability when storing small parts and items. Most bags are 2 Mil where these are 4 Mil.	1
Perfect	1
This is my third order.  The quality is very good. The seal has always worked both in refrigerator and in the freezer. I use the 4 mill as I find it does not puncture or tare in the corners upon opening as easily as other brands and thinner material bags	1
Nice and just right size for my projects	1
Arrived quickly and are great for large dog snacks.	1
Great bags, heavy duty and seal up easy	1
Great	1
Yes! Perfect for protecting all my board gaming bits. This is perfect if you are someone who immediately trashes useless board game inserts. Pro tip: buy a variety of sizes. Yes! You need them all. Your bits will thank you.	1
Great	1
I like these bags. Quite heavy and a nice zip seal. Don't worry about the quality with these.	1
Great bags.  We use them in the kitchen instead of Ziploc. Thicker than regular and freezer Ziplocs.  I wish these bags came in a squarer form factor too.	1
Yes!!! More fantastic baggies for all my board gaming bits.	1
Great quality bags.	1
great size and weight.	1
Perfect size and sturdy	1
GOOD PRODUCT	1
Good quality product, nicely priced too.	1
This is some pretty tough stuff!  I needed something to securely stick a heatsink on some LED's and this stuff works great.	1
OK Its Artic Silver this means its Good - not as wonderful as the actual "Silver" thermal epoxy it uses Aluminum Oxide for thermal conductivity and does a good job at it the best part "Its Non Conductive" - No Shorts or sparks - This is what I use for all small heat sinks - recommended..	1
Very good product	1

great hobby board. rows are well placed if you want to put a dip chip in the center.	1
Really high quality breadboard. Good price, quick shipping.	1
Arrived quickly and works great	1
First off, I'm a total noob when it comes to soldering, and this was my first real soldering project. With that said, I didn't have any issues with this board. The pads didn't lift (even when I know I probably held my iron on the board for too long,) and I didn't have problems with filling adjacent holes with solder like some reviewers commented.  I used this board to create a GPIO protection system for an Arduino, and the power rails down the center were perfect. I mounted the screw terminals along the top and bottom, hooked up the zener between one side and a power rail, and then placed the resistor above the zener to create a bridge between the sides. Worked perfectly :)  If I could change one thing about this board, I wish it had mounting holes on the corners.  Other than that, I loved it!	1
Wypall X80 Foodservice Towels (06280) Extended Use Wipers with Anti-Microbial Treatment, White, 1 Box, 150 Sheets  These towels are used in our house for more than food prep. We have a larger and rather busy household and someone is always doing some kind of project. That means there are spills and messes all over the place and not just in the kitchen. I keep some in the craft room for the kids and their painting to keeping some in the garage for the kids and their woodoworking projects. They are great at wiping up spills in the kitchen but even better that I can wash and dry them. Sure some I have just tossed a couple of them and not tried to save depending on what exactly was being wiped up. Some that had the craft paints on them once dried I wash up just fine in the sink and then reuse them for the same craft. These are also wonderful to grab when I am going on a cleaning binge and wanting to wipe down all counters and walls. Even have used them on one of my floors that is a smaller floor that is just easier for me to hand wash. So far these have held up well in the wash and being reused.	1
Tough, semi-reusable towels.  These can easily be kept in a bleach/water bucket and used again and again all day long washing counters and tables, walls, etc.  These are perfect for nasty jobs where a cloth rag would get ruined or be a pain to wash, but wipes or paper towels would make a lot of waste.  They can be cut or torn into smaller pieces without too much work, but they don't snag or tear easily if not intentional.  They are white and it is obvious when they become too dirty and need changing.	1
These will really spoil you for any other type wipes.  They are made for professional use, but are super handy around the place for cleaning, shop projects, and anytime you need a lint free wiper.  Especially nice for furniture painting and refinishing uses.  They are without a doubt the most sturdy, hard working wipes I've ever used.  The anti static feature is great, especially in dry winter indoor use.  A bit more expensive than other wipes, but depending on what you use them for, they can each be used several times, and should last quite a while.  I know I can't imagine going back to less pricey wipes now, especially when lint is an issue, like mirrors, metals, windows, computer screens, tv screens, etc..	1
It was nice to be offered this to keep on hand here at home.  Though it is mostly used in the professional setting, I was able to use this on my servers and computers here at home.  It is truly lint free and cleans up fast and efficient with one swipe.  Great to use with more sensitive and equipment.  It can be a bit pricey for personal use, but in the professional setting, it is worth using on your expensive equipment.	1
These are some of the most heavy-duty paper towels I have seen. They are large and will hold up to just about any cleaning task. They are soft and pliable, though certainly stiffer than a typical paper towel. They are also very absorbent. While you could use these around the house and kitchen (great for cleaning up grease or other tough stains), they are really good for shops and garages. They won't tear apart on the slightest snag. All that being said, they're pretty expensive. Obviously designed for highly controlled labs, they are well packaged and $125 gets you 500 of them. I guess that's not too unreasonable for home use, given you only need to use one at a time, which is probably equal to 5 standard paper towels.	1
While working with electro-optical components, I typically used lens tissues (wetted with reagent grade isopropyl alcohol [IPA]) to clean optical surfaces as well as solder connections. The tissue was good for cleaning the optics but typically fell apart while cleaning the solder joints. These are much better suited for these types of operations. They absorb and hold IPA well while taking a fair amount of abuse. It does melt, however, so use caution around heat sources.  These are high grade wipes. I also tried these with Purosol for cleaning lenses and other coated and uncoated glass and it worked as expected. I wonder if these can be sterilized. Otherwise they may be used for cleaning medical/pharmaceutical manufacturing areas but those areas would still require sterilization.	1
Great for detailing metals and a wide variety of consumer products. These have the added benefit of anti-static properties. A bit pricey, but it has its purpose.	1
I use these to clean my glass rods before using them to make glass beads, marbles and  icicles. In order to get a good clean glass bead, your glass needs to be extra clean or your beads will be scummy looking. These are perfect for that as they, not only clean, they don't leave lint all over the glass that can cause your imperfections in the finished product. These should last me a few years so the cost isn't really a big factor for me. It makes cleaning my glass much easier and I don't have to worry about it when I sit down at the torch and start creating.  So, for what I am using them for, they are perfect for me and my circumstances.	1
Really lint-free and packaged clean, for clean room applications. Made of polypropylene from recycled soda bottles. Packaged in five packs of 100 in a case. Measuring 12 by 12 inches and static free. Just as described in the listing.	1
We are very pleased with quality and performance of these wipes.  The 12 x 12 size is strong and ideal for many uses.  Better than paper, they are dry, anti-static, and lint-free.  We have expanded their use to expensive electronics and photographic equipment, too.  These are very valuable to have on hand, because when you need them, you need them, and nothing else suits the purpose to the same standard.  Highly recommended.	1
great	1
As expected but overpriced	1
Nice tape	1
Good quality for the money	1
I bought these to use in my nursery for moving small potted plants. They both drop everything due to lack of strength and the jaws twist with little stress. I don't recommend for anything heaver than trash like paper or empty cans.	-1
Great value and you get exactly what you see quickly.	1
Great Product!!! Great Price!!!	1
It's a pipe plug.  It's stainless.	1
Great product great service	1
Well-machined threads and hex socket very well formed.	1
These seem to be good quality plugs.	1
Bought three of these. (2) thousands and a tenths. Two have failed after 6 months of daily use due to un-fixable sticking. All ended up with unacceptable dead zone (stylus movement with no needle movement).	-1
For the price, it is a great option for mid-level indicators. Better than the $15 Indicators- its VERY close in quality to a Mitutoyo- you can feel the quality and it repeats. Of course, when the final readings are needed for buy off; a Mitutoyo or Starrett come out and this goes away as it is not a very known reputable metrology brand. Will buy more. Purchased an Anytime Tools indicator for about the same price- very good too- but after purchasing 2 more they arrived with a failed mainspring- hopefully Turlen won't have that issue.	1
Love Epoxy 5 minute.	1
Good product. Good price	1
great	1
It would be a good holder, but the holes for the screwdrivers get progressively smaller from back to front. Therefore, the ones I use most of the time have to go in back, which makes them less accessible. For six bucks I won't return it, but I won't be using it either. It will get donated to Goodwill.	-1
great price	1
Good high quality tag.  Commercial grade.	1
I've been using CLP Break-Free for thirty years or so. It does everything it says it does.	1
If you have guns this is the size to buy! Stop wasting money on buying 4 oz's at a time. Buy this and save hundreds and be set...	1
Holds back very little pressure. I bought this to put on an industrial ice maker bin drain to prevent critters from coming through the drain.  The ice maker is in my garage.  I was concerned that it would hold a certain amount of water in the bin, but the bin is able to fully drain.	1
These work great for drain valves under my camping trailer. They screw directly into the existing drain pipe.	1
They do the trick, and they are cheap. Heavier duty than I expected, too.	1
Woks as you would expect.  No problems or issues.	1
This is a very smooth operating medium-duty valve.  It is not at all flimsy, and about as good as I've seen in PVC.  A good choice for PVC water pipes.  I've only used it for a couple on-off cycles, but at least for now, it is drip-free.	1
Great pvc ball valve.  Rock solid and none that I've purchased leaked a drop.	1
I needed to install reliable valves on a  couple of plastic buckets that I use for home brewing, and I wanted to standardize all of my connections with 1/2" NPT (standard 1/2" pipe threads). This, coupled with a LifeGard aquatics 1/2" bulkhead fitting and a couple of Banjo nipples, allowed me to do just that. The ball valve is bullet-proof, and I have no problem turning it on/off on any of the three that I installed, as at least one reviewer reported. They are quite long, but this is not a concern for me. I highly recommend these if you need a reliable plastic ball valve.	1
Would buy it again, great product!	1
Last year after moving to our new home, I had the local lumber store delivery 2x4's, bunch of 1/2" & 3/4" plywood as well as 3/4" full MDF all in full 4'x8' sheets.  MDF of course being the heaviest I had to somehow slide it down the bulkhead door opening which barely fit and slide it down.  Even then I was struggling and woke up the next morning with a lot of pain (I'm in my late 30's).  With that said I wish I had this gripper then!  I was AMAZED at how easily it picks up lighter 4x8 sheets with no issues.  Now, as far as MDF, unless you're a big lifter and can easily curl 50 lbs, you'll still have hard time lifting it off the ground BUT, it makes sliding it much easier and have leverage as well as not feel like it'll fall over.  I've been using it to move the sheets around and looking to get more plywood so it'll make moving a breeze next time.  Mine was some heavy duty looking plastic and not sure why people are complaining but seems to work perfectly fine.  If you're working with A LOT of MDF's or heavy 3/4" sheet for any major project, I would get two for two people.  It'll make lifting much easier I'm sure.  It's like having the forearm furniture lifting straps.  It reduces strain, possible injury and just saves time.  I'm thinking to move a large MDF sheets next time I'll make a simple flat dolly but with a larger tire to roll it across my backyard.  As long as you can lift one end you shouldn't have any issue moving heavyweight items.  For most projects using regular plywood, this gripper is a big must!  And yes it can handle full sheet of drywood but I would be careful in lifting as it's very possible to just crack the area if you angle it too much while it's being gripped.	1

If you are buying these for an air compressor in your workshop, or for outdoor use, this review probably won't matter at all. I purchased these for industrial sewing machines, and I will see/touch these sheaves on a regular basis.  I've ordered two of these, and both arrived the same way: in boxes that looked like they were very old, left out in the sun, dirty, and had been re-taped or re-packaged several times. One arrived clearly previously used and scratched up, another looked like it had just been scratched in transit.  While these are heavy nice cast iron, I've noticed the machining is not very precise at all; one of them has a machined surface that only exists on half the face of the pulley, the other half is straight out of the casting. I have no idea how or why that pulley made it past their QC. Also, the AK61 I ordered arrived with a keyway and double grub-screws, which was not what was pictured/described, but will work for my application..  If I had ordered one of the $50-60 versions of these pulleys, I would be upset and this would be a 1 star review.  But for the bigger sizes that are only $15-30, these are an amazing value.	1
as advertised no problems	1

Used this to seal up an opened up transmission tunnel that had to be customed cut out. Welded it all up and used this sealer. Worked awesome. Would recommend for any auto that needs sealed.	1
Nice modular upgradable package,as you can add on additional terminators as needed.	1
I needed one more elbow for my rapider system. These fittings work great.  Just make sure that your hose is cut clean and straight and these things won't leak	1
Only use these if you must. These Rt. Angle elbows cut flow-rate by a huge percentage. Try curving the line rather than using these instead.	1
Great price great fitting.	1
Good product.	1
Rapidair system is excellent. I installed a halo configuration in my 1500 sq ft shop with 10 drops. It works perfectly and I haven't experienced any issues yet. It is easy to install and looks great.	1
Rebuilding spray equipment and this hose is really tough, I'm looking forward to seeing it perform for many years.	1
Tubing, what else is there to say,ecept just as advertised	1
Everybody needs this.  Buy it now.	1

really great stuff	1
I looked and looked for a table to give me extra counter space in my small kitchen. I am glad I decided on this one because it is stainless steel for cleanliness and very sturdy with a shelf underneath for storing things. I can place my cutting board on it for cutting up veggies.	1
Quality glass!	1
Just what I needed.  I would have given it five stars, but one of them broke on me very easily.  It was surprising, and loud!	1
Great Job	1
Good product,fast shipping	1
I would love to tell you that it'll never break & that this is a 1 time buy , but stuff happens. It's heat resistant not break proof , but it's so nice to use over the cheapness of the others out there. Spend the extra money & enjoy and if it happens to slip out of your fingers during a whiskey proof , or whatever -- maybe don't be quite as drunk on your own concocted beverage while using the Pyrex -- get the plastic one out for those nights. Personally I have 3 -- I will risk breaking just to get to use them. Fortunately no breaks & just hard knocks & a few slips thru the fingers to glass table so far , but nothing has broke either.	1
Good product	1
Arm is a bit flimsy, but works. Magnetic base is great. I would buy this again.	1
Very good base for the money. It's not Starrett but it's less than 1/4 the price and it works great. Good strong magnet	1
Good product	1
Worked as advertised. Thank you	1
The bristles of these brushes came flying off the shaft first time I used them in a Dremel tool to try & remove carbon deposits from a 304 stainless steel barbecue grate.	-1
Good product. Exactly what I needed.	1
simply good. but expensive.	1
I use these to portion out my daily 2 tablespoons of FIBER supplement. That way I can grab a pre-measured container and take it with me to work, school or just at home in the mornings without having to drag out the fiber container and measuring spoons every day.  Also holds salad dressings, pre-measured  peanut butter, mayo, ketchup, mustard, sour cream, etc.  You can also use them for paints, sprinkles, beads, powders, lotions...........1001 uses.	1
Just what I needed and a good price.	1
great device.. I have been using for all of my development.	1
I use a 6"x6" square of this material for a backpacking water prefilter when I have to pull drinking water from dirty water sources.  .5 microns is small enough to filter out sediment and a good percentage of soluble clay that adds turbidity to water.  I use this sheet to prefilter before running my drinking water through my Sawyer Squeeze.  It saves the Sawyer from prematurely clogging and requiring as many backflushes.  Great stuff, and enough to last for years.  I shared some with some other hikers and they loved it.	1
These cups crack real easy!	-1
works	1
I believe these fittings will last ,just do not over tight them.	1
awesome	1
delivered good as new	1
works as it should. great price, excellent for my DIY REPRAP bowden extruder.	1
Working well on my Kossel Mini.	1
I got this to use with a Bowden tube on an extruder for my 3D printer.  The end with the threads needs to be chamfered.  Not hard with the right tools, but be forewarned that it's a sharp hole if you don't plan on smoothing it.	1
Used these to connect bowden tube for the extruder on my mini-Kossel RepRap 3D printer. Work great.	1
Purchased to attach a bowden tube to an Airtripper V3 extruder on my Mini Kossel. Grips the tube wonderfully, but will wear a band into the tube over time, making release pretty tough.	1
I ordered Translucent Black. I received solid black. Can't even shine an LED flashlight thru it. Maybe it is just a wrong item. I will order again, Translucent, Dictionary -> "Transparent (of a substance) allowing light, but not detailed images, to pass through; semitransparent."	-1
good stuff , priced right, and saved me a trip to the hardware store.	1
I purchased several sizes of these, close to 600 bags total. I am starting to run out after about 18 months. So far, I have not had a single bag with any defect whatsoever, including the closures. I don't know what more I can add except to say that I use these for electronic cabling, some of which can have somewhat sharp edges. These bags hold up to anything I put in them. I am ordering more today.	1
these are good. i use them to store small parts sorted in a baseball card box. i wish they were a little stiffer because sometimes they slide under each other and hide. but still. not bad, not bad at all.	1
Flawless	1
This was a good meter while it lasted.  No, it doesn't have the 100 KHz frequency some would like but it was pretty accurate and easy to use.  Why just one star?  The meter died just a few days after I started using it and it gives an error code indicating that the SMD fuse is blown. This happened after measuring a large capacitor (which had  been shorted out first).  I replaced that which was not hard to do but the error remains.  B&K indicates that the meter was damaged by me and has to be sent in for service at a cost that makes me question if I want to throw more money at it.  My advice is to just stay away from this, it seems to easily damaged.  What seemed like a good value could end up costing as much as the more capable Keysight meter I should have bought in the first place.	-1

This is just what I needed.	1
It works really good thank you very much	1
After getting to test some cool space-age bristle and polishing cup configurations, the actual toothbrush portion of things here was a bit of a letdown; it's just a normal toothbrush, despite the colored bristles, I didn't notice any fancy brushing action going on. But the little nubby bits on the back of the head are actually really great for tongue and cheek brushing. I have a small mouth, so it brushed my cheeks for me while I got my teeth, and then I manually brushed my tongue. I don't use a tongue scraper and just normally brush my tongue with the brush, so this was fun to give a little extra attention to hygeine in that way. It's a fun thing to try if you are considering a tongue scraper, and a decent regular, no frills toothbrush to boot.	1
This brush does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth without having to make several passes. I like the size of the brush head and the handle is comfortable and easy to hold. I really have no complaints about this toothbrush. All in all a great product!	1
First, you may want to note that the color you see in the photo is not necessarily the one you will get. I received this in a bright pink color. So keep in mind if you are ordering this brush specifically trying to get one in the color shown, you many very well end up with another one. Also I've found that some of Colgate's medium firmness toothbrushes feel a little like the firm version of other brands. So if you are trying to decide between a medium or firm, you may find the medium is plenty you.  This Colgate MaxFresh is a good brush, with a full sized head. So you won't feel like you're brushing with a kid's toothbrush. It's called MaxFresh because in addition to the cleaning bristles of the brush, on the back of the brush head it is textured with some little rubber dots that can be used for cleaning the tongue.  The bristles on the Colgate MaxFresh are slightly staggered for getting into teeth crevices. However they are not quite as staggered as on the Colgate 360 brush, which has bristles that are also very good at getting around the gum line. But the bristles on the Colgate 360 are aligned in more unusual rounded shape. So those who prefer their bristles on their tooth brush to be in a traditional style will like this Colgate MaxFresh brush better.  The handle of the toothbrush has a rubber texture grip to it as well. So it's easy to hold even if the handle gets wet. The color of the handles of the brush I received is bright pink with red accents. If you're looking for a more traditional style tooth brush, go with this MaxFresh brush. If you're looking for a brush that's a little more unusual but might clean even a step above this brush, check out the Colgate 360.	1
Used for making straw holes in canning lids for covered glasses.	1
This an incredible product for the hobbyist. It can be used in many other applications, besides coating tissue film over balsa. I use it to seal balsa wood, which when dried, actually makes the wood stronger. You can also use Eze Dope as a glue to apply tissue covering on model airplanes. I also use Eze Dope to finish the tissue covering. I brush it onto the pre-shrunk tissue, letting the Eze Dope dry before applying another coat of it. The strength it gives to tissue is amazing. Best of all, there are no toxic fumes, and since I like using my hands to feel the surface of my work, I can also apply it using my fingers. You can also make wood filler by mixing Eze Dope with talcum powder. It is truly an amazing and handy product for the hobbyist.	1
Great value!  I use this on the spark plug threads for my Rotax 912 airplane engine.  I figure this little container is probably a lifetime supply.	1
as expected	1
I love this Shark Cordless Vacuum. It has lots of power for picking up dog hair. This is my second one and the first one lasted for 8 years and I had no problem getting a new one.	1
no issues	1
This stainless steel pipe is lighter and stronger than normal DOM tubing, and it doesn't rust.	1
This tubing easily warrants six or seven stars!  I'm using it. as a replacement for #304 stainless-steel tubing, in producing one-off compact camp-fire grids.  Up to now, trying to source micro-quantities of heat-resistant tubing has been very difficult (and very expensive).  Kudos for Amazon.com!	1
Excellent tuning with a good finishe. Arrived without damage.	1
Heavy duty. Great product.	1
Just what i need for my projects	1
to cheap wanted better	-1
It is all plastic but it is affordable	1
Good quality and shipped very promptly. I probably wouldn't buy this for a commercial, daily-use machine, but for my home shop it is appropriate. The more expensive switches are more solid, but this was good for my intended, occasional use as a replacement on my lathe.	1
Good Kydex no issues	1
SECOND REVISED REVIEW (earlier reviews below) I've lowered the rating again, this time to two stars. There is just no excuse for charging over thirty hard earned dollars for a kit that just doesn't have enough product to finish jobs. The tape products themselves are high quality-I'm just telling you the kit is not worth the money.  Recommendation: if you have an application for one of the tapes in this kit, buy that product. They are all high quality products that perform as advertised. Do not purchase this kit.  REVISED REVIEW: (Original review below) The more I use this kit, the more frustrated I get. It is simply not a good value.  The red and blue duct tape rolls are pitifully short. Just about when you get a feel for this vinyl duct tape, you run out. The corner masking tape looked interesting, but ultimately was just squares of masking tape which weren't any better than squares of tape you tear off from a roll of masking tape. And what really set me off may seem trivial: The cover of the box says, "Remove Pet Hair". Sorry, but nowhere in this expensive box of tape with an oversize, two-sided, full-color instruction sheet is there any information about removing pet hair.  The quantities are too small to justify the price. I'm still giving three stars because every product seems to be high quality. Don't buy this unless you have an application for the small quantities of most or all of these samples. As mentioned in the original review, there's not enough safety walk tape in the kit to do a full bathtub...  ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'm of two minds about this kit. The products are great-the collection does a good job of introducing you to tapes you wouldn't necessarily have purchased individually. My favorites were the wire management tape, which does exactly what it promises, cleaning up wire messes without residue; the corner masking tape, which nicely solves a painting problem; and the reflective tape, which it would have been nice to have about three times as much of in the kit.  And there lies the problem with the kit: Not enough product in many cases to do useful things. There's only one kind of masking tape; there is not quite enough of the SafetyWalk anti-slip strips to do a tub; and the reflective tape runs out far too quickly.  Summary: The products are great, but you need more of most of them. It's a sampler. But quality wins out, four stars instead of the three I was tempted to give.	-1
Like to eork with it on my projects.	1
Made a jig out of 1/4" ply, then used a router to cut this into 3 headlight protecting shrouds.	1
Worked perfectly for lenses in the Lamp I designed. Easy to cut, crystal clear, looks awesome!!!	1
Excellent product	1
We've used Hoppe's lubricant on our guns for years. I specifically wanted a spray lubricant to use on the magazines so the lubricant would penetrate where it would be difficult to apply lubricant in drop form.	1
Works great for lubing guns and spraying down the reloading press. Also works good for spraying on leather work boots to prevent cracking, plus it smells great!	1
Didn't work as well as other products.  Would not buy again.  >^..^<	-1
Worked good for what I needed . Didnt break down at all during heavy use	1
used to remove metal rust	1
worked great	1
very good	1
Worked perfect. I used it to tap a clutch pivot bolt hole on my big block Chevy. Nice and sharp.	1
Good quality tool that cut cast iron well.	1
Item arrived in a timely manner and was as described.	1
WORKS FOR ME	1
Great product, thanks you	1
Item arrived in a timely manner and was as described.	1
Nice LED's and resistors. Fast delivery.	1
Was looking for 28 bright Red LED's to operate in unison for a project. These fit the bill perfectly. They are lined up in double rows and I can say they are visually uniform in intensity/brightness. LED's are drawing 18 mA each in my application and working very well. Supplied resistors are 200 ohm, somewhat of an unusual value, but were suitable for my use and are good quality. All LED's and resistors worked out of the box - no rejects.	1
Worked just fine.	1
Very nice product	1
i use this lights for invents	1
These are small in size and don't crimp down on wire without stripping. These don't stack up with connectors that are more IDC compliant. If you are in a pinch and these are all that are available, these connectors will get you by. For the money they are a cheap just in case to keep on hand.	-1
works great	1
These are very nice LEDs, have a nice glow that is rather like an incandescent bulb as compared to say, an LED flashlight, which has the glaring bluish bright white light. These are more suited to like an electric candle or nightlight, a pleasing glow that does not blind you. I am happy with them. Let me know if you found my review Helpful or if you have any questions. Thanks!	1
Good product.  I use the smaller 3 mm size more than the 5 mm.	1
Just as ordered, works great!	1
LEDs and resistors appear to be as described. Note that they DO look like the picture -- a fairly narrow cone of light; not a wide dispersal like a traditional lightbulb.  As long as you know what you're getting here, you'll be quite pleased!	1
Exceptional and UNIQUE.  Dual-lock adheres to ITSELF!  It is NOT a fuzzy side and a hook side.  The material acts like BOTH.	1
My husband and I found this preferable to the regular velcro for outside purposes because it holds better in the wind. The drawback is that it is pretty enpensive.	1
Good price and needed right away.  Could not get locally.	1
<div id="video-block-R1B9OU9025B7YO" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/C1ugrHvch9S.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81uTTADY63S.png" class="video-slate-img-url">Words can't completely describe this, so please watch my 1 1/2 minute video and you can see what's inside the box.  For the cost of this product, this is all marketing and packaging, a lot of space, and a VERY SMALL amount of product, and the product is mostly just tape or strips of stuff to decorate, not really all that useful.  I will say that the product items, the tape, does appear to be high quality good tape, good command-strips, good "hook and latch" (looks like Velcro(TM)), so what you do get is good, and I will say that someone really creative could put these to good use, however I suspect they would be disappointed in the quantities of each.  The bottom line measure of success (or lack of success in this case) came when my senior in high school, and my junior in college, both pretty creative daughters, said, what? why? chuckled at it, and neither one wanted it.  Sorry, this is an expensive box that you might think you are getting something special with, or if you are giving it as a gift, it might make you feel that it looks like a nice gift and you paid a lot for it, but no... it's not.	-1
I believe this is a good product for a college room: most tapes are in small quantities and the price is not cheap, yet on the bright side they allow room for creativity and should be enough for 1 college room. If you're in a hurry to get something for a college room, I believe this is a perfect fit. 3M has bigger tape kits -  just search on Amazon -  if you planning to use them for more than one room. There are descriptions, suggested applications and instructions for each of the 11 types of items.	1
You have to be creative to really get full use out of this set.  It is cool to see the various kinds of tape and think about ways to use them.  I never knew they even made glow in the dark tape.  The wire management tape is also quite useful.  The "radiant light" tape is interesting, but I still haven't found a good use for it.  I think this would be a good gift for a craft college student or even an older crafter.  The brightly colored tapes are good for scrapbooks and the post of it tape is so smart.  I also didn't realize they made that (I need to head to the adhesive aisle more, apparently).  It has a few useful, non-crafty items like command strips and hook and loop pieces, but you can purchase those separately if you just wanted to hang stuff on your dorm walls.  It only has only 2 command strips and 6 hook and loop velcro pairs.  There is a lot of packaging, as some other reviewers state, but I think it's mostly because this is supposed to be a "kit" teaching you about the uses of the tape.  When you open the box, you get a guide that lists all the tapes, applications and instructions for use.  This might be overkill.  Here's an example of the instructions: "remove release liner and apply to clean, dry surface." If your kid hasn't figured out how to use tape, they're going to have real trouble in college.  When you remove the instructions for use, you get a tray filled with the various tapes.  On the back of the instruction sheet is a map of where the tape is in the tray. I am not sure they could package the same variety in a smaller box and still tell you what it is.  I'm sure you would be able to buy full rolls of at least a few of the the various tapes for cheaper than the whole kit, but this kit is about variety.  Overall, this set has taught me there are a great variety of items in the adhesive aisle I didn't know about.	1
This is a useful set of adhesive bands which would be convenient for a college dorm or handy around the house. The quality of the tape is excellent. Treat this box a tape like a mixed box of nuts and bolts. You're never quite sure when you're going to need one and some of them will never use but their awful handy to have around. I could see some college students using all these pieces of tape and others never using any. I particularly like the tape or binding up cords, the glow-in-the-dark tape, and the Velcro strips.	1
Super inspection tool	1
great for looking in walls, and good to peak in beginning of drains	1
Good tool to have in your arsenal if you need to see what is going on in tight spaces where you really can't fit your head into.  I have used this to examine evaporator coils on AC units when I can only get a small opening to get the camera through.  If it wasn't for this tool I would probably just let things go until something wasn't working.  This allows me to do preventive maintenance and see what is going on where I would otherwise not have been able to see.  I could see using this in a lot of different types of mechanical service work.  And even though I have only pulled it out a couple of times it seems to be of quality construction.  The light seems ample to illuminate enclosed dark spaces and the video resolution is sufficient to see the detail of what you are looking at.	1
No complaints, they work well.	1
Very nice test lead grabbers.  Teeth are pretty sharp and the plungers are smooth. Worth picking up for the DMM bag.	1
Great clips. A little big. Works great!	1
<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Extech-TL709-Alligator-Clip-Set/dp/B004WN6XKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Extech TL709 Alligator Clip Set</a> Extech TL709 MEDIUM Alligator Clip Set.  These alligator clips are are big.  They measure 4" long, and the jaws open a full 1" wide.  They are stamped category 3, 1000V, with a maximum current rating of 10 amps.  The spring is strong, and provides a tenacious grip while operating smoothly.  They will easily clip to the negative or positive terminals on a standard 12V automobile battery.  My test leads plug into the female ends snugly and securely.  I highly recommend them.	1
Seemed to be very good quality. Very strong clamping power. Would much rather pay for these compared to the price Klein has on theirs.	1
perfect	1
These are VERY sharp and precise test probes.  Great for piercing insulation without damaging it beyond repair.  Also, these are great for fine pitch pads and pins.  The plastic isn't quite as nice as Fluke or Pomona probes.	1
Tried to use it for an entry into a camper unfortunately the actual size didn't include the 1" rubber edge so it was to big had to return it,,but if it fit I would have used it.	-1
This is a must for the tradesmen or the beginner is good to have...	1
The bolt-nut-screw gauge I got was in an Everbilt package, but the gizmo itself was labeled as a Crown Bolt product. No big deal. The plastic/nylon device is good enough for my hobbyists & homeowner needs. I think if I was a mechanic or machinist I would want something a bit more detailed. It has saved me a few repeat trips to the hardware store - knowing what size bolt/nut you need really is useful.	1
I do a huge amount of handy man work, and this takes the guess work out of knowing which nut or bolt to go after to complete a job. Love it. And it fits just right in my tool box.	1
Very handy when it comes to sourcing nuts and bolts. I gave it 4 stars because it is ink printed and can come off over a period of time.	1
works as intended	1
does what it's supposed to	1
How does one review hex nuts? These worked fine and the price was right.	1

Great ss item at good value	1
stainless screws , what can I say!	1
need these screws for my washing machine, priced  OEM replacements  $ 3.00 a piece and needed  3 ea , again Amazon saved the day, low price  and no shipping thanks to PRIME. Thank you.	1
Saves me a 70 mile round-trip to a real home improvement store (living out in the country... gotta love it....). Thankfully amazon has this available for me!	1
I think these were returned becaused I measured too short for the workaround the pool I needed them for....No problem on returns, what a company huh ?	1
needed these for cabinate work	1
Great ss item at good value	1
Junk, broke off after having drilled a pilot hole.  Junk, Junk	-1
I need to secure thin metal panels to a kitchen drywall located above a bank of cabinets.  Just in case I encounter a metal stud I want a good metal screw like this.  The little phillips head fit snugly into my phillips head bit on my drill.  The screw dug into a metal drywall stud without issue.  My house has metal studs not wood. The heads of the screws give my metal screen dscor accent a nice finished look.  I had no problem with these screws breaking off.  For the price you get a lot of these screws.	1
Product is as listed. Now to see if they rust like most SS from China does.	1
Replaces galvanized hardware. Live less than a mile from ocean, salt spay can be a corrosion problem. Stainless is the best solution for environment. Very useful.	1
Great ss item at good value	1
These bolts a junk,  I have broken three already and the three had pilot holes drilled.  Buy quality SS bolts and screws and steer away from these ones.	-1
hello,   in need of stainless steel pan head screws?  these are pretty handy and come in a box.  i use them around salt water and they do not tarnish or rust.  some versions of stainless steel screws do tarnish, but these do not.  they hold well and the head does not slip on the drill bit or screwdriver.  i only use phillips versions for everything since the straight cut heads do not work for me any longer.  quality product and fast delivery....how can you go wrong?	1
Quality Pyrex Flask. you get what you pay for.	1
Great Little flask.  It is a tiny thing, but it is Pyrex so it is very durable.  I use it for making my own Ejuice.	1
Nice quality, no complaints	1
Pyrex makes they're beakers slightly thicker then most so they are stronger which is idea for my purposes.  They take longer to heat and chill but strength is want I'm looking for and these r perfect.  I will and I do buy these all the time.	1
Arrived on time, well packaged. The actual glassware is just as advertised. (Though this thing is tiny).	1
Quality Pyrex Flask. you get what you pay for.	1
Nice flask, but as many have stated the bottom is domed making it impossible to use with a stir plate.	1
this is the correct flask for the #9 stopper. it is made of thick glass, and nicely labeled. the bottom is flat enough for good magnetic stirring.	1
I'm sure a good bit of the people buying this here are using this for yeast starters. I did the same!  Dear government, I simply make beer at home for personal use. I am no Heisenberg..  Anyway, I have many times used this vessel to boil water directly on my gas range, and chill it straight in cool water in the sink. The pyrex glass can't be beat. I had a casserole dish made from real Pyrex, and it was awesome. But.. "someone" broke it, and now Pyrex brand dishes are mostly just regular glass, and they break if you walk past them wrong.	1
very good quality.	1
Great little product for random testing and very useful in the field	1
After upgrading the firmware this little scope does what I need... I use it for noise checks in servo drives... Really pretty small but it works... For $50 can't beat it...	1
I don't understand how this glue doesn't work for some people. It could be about technique and how much you apply. Maybe they need to read the instructions - I don't know...  This works as expected for me.	1
Bonds really well and is hard as a rock when dry.  But I find it takes minutes not seconds to bond.  And it is somewhat runny making vertical applications or tiny part binding challenging.  Also the tube tends to seal itself shut unless you store it vertically.  Every once it a while it still clogs the nozzle and you have to cut the nozzle off lower and lower till it eventually just seals the whole cap.  Then you have to open it with a couple of pliers.  The glue is great.  Just the applicator that needs work.	1
very good for modeling	1
no comment	1
thanks	1
These 2.5 Inch gauges are really easy to read from a reasonable distance. And the price for the quality is at a very nice point. If you have the room for a largish pressure gauge I certainly reccomend this size. The gauge appears to be accurate - It tracked against another gauge when I was comparing them.  The only negative I have is that these gauges have no damping. If you use it with a tankless type compressor there is a lot of pulsation in the output air and the needle will vibrate quite visibly even downstream of a regulator. For that application I was concerned that the constant vibration of the gauge might eventually lead to west-out failure of the gauge, thought there was no problem while I was testing it.  In extreme cases with pulsating air pressure the only common fixes I know of are: You can use a liquid filled pressure gauge that damps out the movement. You can add some sort of tank ahead of the gauge and user that will absorb the pressure fluctuations. You can have a very small orfice in the feed to gauge that averages out the pressure for the gauge. Or you can ignore the vibrating needle and hope the gauge does not wear out.  On the plus side the gauge is easy to read and a good value at the price I paid. It is exact what it is advertised to be, no more, no less. On the could use improvement side I wish these gauges had some damping. But unless you are using a tankless air compressor its not an issue.	1
Broke on first use. Reads about 20 psi with no pressure applied. Disappointed indeed.	-1

This is my second tube of the Arctic Alumina, goes on easy. Non hardening formula  Lower my CPU temps	1
Very good quality and lite weight!!! I love it!!!	1
Little round washers...should be good as backing for the rivets I bought in the same order. I can tell they'll work just by looking at them. Yippee.	1
Quality aluminum washers.	1
...Then get the washers, too!!!  Very useful in many circumstances.	1
Very good price on well made washers, with fast service.	1
Very nice gauge. Works well!	1
Solid caliper for the price.  It's no Mitutoyo or anything.  But for casual use it'll easily do what you need it to.  I use it for reloading.	1
A great way to dispense CLP. I love to use CLP on my firearms.	1
Excellent	1
Ok.  For those of you who have arthritis this product is a god sent.  Very convenient and sturdy.  I will update as the heat of summer tests this product.  >^..^<	1
Really nice caster.  I can move my little RV around the driveway without hooking it up to my truck.  Sure makes things a lot easier for me.	1
Good hard shaft.  Used it with bronze  bushings on a snow plow set up.  works great.	1

Hibiclens is an awesome, multiuse product and I've used it for years.  If you get into really nasty gunk (going into the crawl space under the house), get cuts and scrapes working in soil, or are having a surgical procedure, or develop a skin infection, then you need to keep this around.  Get wet, pour some in your hand and cover your body.  Let it sit for a few minutes and rinse.  Kills just about any bacteria you manage to have on your skin.  I've used it in my hair, face, etc... I've never had it irritate my skin.  Do NOT get it in your eyes because it will sting like any soap.  The best part is the anti-bacterial effect lasts for about 6 hours after you rinse it off.  I've also used it on my dog, who happens to be a skin infection magnet.  I've avoided vet visits and antibiotics by washing him with hibiclens every other day for a week.  I also make up a solution and apply with a small cloth (blot,don't wipe) to the affected area, let it sit, then blot with plain water.  Hospitals will often send you home with Hibiclens (or a similar Chlorhexadine product) to wash with before having a surgical procedure.  This is done to prevent MRSA and other skin infections.  Its also good to wash with after having surgery (leaving the hospital so you don't bring scary stuff back to your house).	1
Cool assortment!!!	1
works well and not as intrusive as those big screw ones.  those leave large hole when removed, these don't and have much smaller footprint when installed.	1
I've only used a couple of these and they seemed a bit fussy to use compared to the lead anchor types which I've used lots of over the years. One of the "ears" crinkled up during installation and I had to toss it; not a huge deal but I think it may be an indication that they require closer attention than some. Other than that the price for a big box of them seems reasonable enough and the description was accurate, I'd recommend them.	1
These were as described.	1
These are designed for HEAVY loads and work as advertised.	1
As described, fast shipping.	1
WORKS GREAT IF RV WHICH HAS THIN WALLS	1
I bought these for the first time to mount a kitchen shelf. At first my husband didn't know if he wanted to use them or not, but he did and we were both well pleased. I can see where they would leave quite a hole if you wanted to remove the whole thing, but I don't have any plans for removing this shelf. They really worked slick, so easy to install.	1
Great bit 5 stars	1
This is an excellent drill bit.  I purchased the 7mm for drilling pen blanks.  It is perfect, very sharp, very strong, and does a decent job of clearing sawdust from the flute; although some hardwoods like cocobolo gets caked in when trying to drill all the way through a 2 inch piece without clearing it about halfway(you can get all the way through, but the flute is pretty much maxed out at the 2 inches).  All in all it is perfect for my needs and at a good price for such a quality bit, I will be buying more. So far I have only drilled about 20 blanks, both hardwood and soft wood from ebony, cocobolo, cherry, elm, padauk, black walnut, and purple heart to soft maple, red cedar, spanish cedar, all with outstanding results and little effort.  Should any abnormal wear take place or if it doesn't last as long as previous bits I will return and update this review.	1
This gets rid of 100% chlorine for the whole house. The only downside is that our water pressure really dropped in the shower :(	1
Beautiful and surprisingly easy to work with. This relatively thick wire made solid bracelets and sturdy shapes and frames for hanging mobiles. I'll need more soon.	1
All is well.	1
Perfect size for making sun catchers!	1
Great price and did exactly what I needed.	1
Just what I needed.  No complaints.	1
exactly as described, good quality, satisfied with this product	1
Excellent quality .	1
I bought these because my cats were scratching the wall near the litter boxes.  I used some E600 glue to put them on the wall and they are staying on nicely and my cats are not able to scratch them.  These were the perfect size and best deal I could find after days of researching them.	1
Nice .  Can be cut with scissors.	1

slightly cheesy construction, it's going to break.  good idea, plastic handle is fine.  telescoping shaft is fine. mirror and LEDs and switch are fine.  The little dual-ball-squeezy-plate hinge thing is the typical weak spot on these - too stiff or too floppy and no way to buy spare parts so once it goes, the whole things gets binned.  But the case is kinda cheesy and I can't see it lasting long in a pro shop.  For a home or non-flat-rate user, it will be fine for years.  It's cheap enough that a year or two lifetime makes it worthwhile but this isn't something that will last a lifetime.  if you can buy it off a truck with a warranty, do that.  you will be using the warranty...  :)	1
Works great for calibrating a 3D printer.  The gauges are nice and long so you can easily reach under the print head.  The frame is metal but the thumb screw is plastic.  You could always print a new thumb screw if the original breaks.  But I don't think the original is that likely to break as it seems to be made from good plastic.  The gauges are oily but that wipes right off.  Better than being rusty.  I haven't had it long enough to test the longevity of the etching on the blades.  Overall, well worth the money.	1
Bought this to level my 3d printer bed, it has the length to get under the cooler mod that I installed and helps me get high accuracy on the leveling task.  As a suggestion, add a star washer to the screw so that it will dig in and allow for proper tightening	1
Nice height, weight, and plastic material for a garden bucket. Doesn't take up much room, easy and lightweight to haul around the yard with an adequate amount of space for garden supplies.  I thought about using it to store salt for snow removal and other things, seems versatile for lots of projects. Turned into my go to bucket, highly recommend.	1
ok	1
I purchased several of these for under 3-bucks each and thats better than the home center and I didn't have to drive 40-miles. I use these extensively in an above ground watering system covering about an acre with 1 & 3/4" poly pipe thats fed from a pump in an irrigation canal. I use the valves to establish zones so I don't have to run around turning spray rotors on and off. it stays above ground so I can easily move it as our gardening patters change but everything except the rotors stays out there year round and these valves have yet too fall apart or be destroyed by our long hot high dessert summers. Good valve for the price and much better than the PVC stem valves that started leaking under my sink after a few uses.	1

very nice unit	1
added to my Tevo Black Widow 3D printer for auto-leveling. works great!	1
works perfect on my 3D printer, arrived early	1
Edit Feb 6 2017  OK, Second one of these just died. I haven't put a half-spool of filament through my 3d printer, which I have been trying to use these as Z-Probes for autoleveling and no had two start flaking out with WILDLY inconsistent performance, then just close the sensor circuit and not sense anymore. These just do NOT stand up to the accelerations the printer head goes through - I guess it is zero coincidence that similarly rated probes from Mouser cost over $100.. It's like these are seconds or rejects.	-1
Good quality E-stop button, works well and has a satisfying "click."	1
The 3M Scotch Premium Grade Transparent Cellophane Tape is a much higher quality packing tape than traditional thin but easy to tear packing tapes. Although transparent, the tape has a slight yellowish cast. The tape as marketed as "easy to tear" - with a sharp blade. All attempts to tear the tape yielded a rough stretched appearance - use cutters or scissors for a neat finished appearance. High quality, withstood being used in a hot and humid room with a hot tub.	1
This works well on small boxes. I have been moving so this works out perfect. I use this on shoe boxes to  small packing boxes. Great part of the heat resistant tape is that it will not come open when it is stored or on a truck for hours in the heat. Good and sturdy great product from 3m.	1
This packing tape is clear and transparent but it does give a slight yellowish tinge to white surfaces. You really don't notice it when you put it over dark or colored surfaces. This tape does tear by hand but not as easily as masking tape or painters tape.  Using it with a dispenser is preferable to tearing it by hand.  This tape is really strong and adheres really well. It does a great job of sealing cardboard boxes.	1
This a a good narrow packaging tape.  It isn't really an inch wide though, but 7/8 of an inch.  It is too narrow for most boxes, but works great for padded envelopes.  I've used it in a pinch for wrapping a present.  It's almost clear when in a single layer, and the slight yellow tint doesn't show on colored wrapping paper.	1
I ship out a lot of packages so I thought this would be quite useful. I have to say I am disappointed in that... it's not even quite an inch (they say it is, but it isn't), and although it works great, it's a bit of a pain to have to use multiple strips of it to close up the middle seam on my packages.  But what this tape DOES excel in is wrapping presents.  I find the width actually much nicer than your traditional Scotch tape used for this use.  And don't be scared by the brown look; it has the slightest amber tint but it's only seen in the roll, not when you pull the tape off in single layers. It looks clear on the presents.  So I recommend the tape because it's strong, temperature resistant, etc... but just not for shipping other than when you need a very thin strip.	1
Don't let the image of the tape here fool you - this tape is not a dark color but rather mostly clear like the description says.  It really is almost clear, with just the slightest tinge of amber color that you'll only notice against light backgrounds.  When taping up cardboard for packaging, you'll probably never notice the color at all (or care if you do).  The deeper color in the image is just due to multiple layers of tape stacked on top of each other.  I'm not a tape expert, but the strength and thickness of this seems very much like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Scotch-142-Packaging-Tape/dp/B00HVG8184/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Scotch 142 Packaging Tape</a>&nbsp;except that it's about half the width (and not completely clear).  Scotch claims this to have higher heat resistance, which isn't a bad thing when shipping in summer, but I'm not aware of the less expensive 142 tape failing due to heat when I've used it.  The description says that it tears by hand, which is true.  You'll get fairly straight, but not totally straight, edges when you do that.  Scotch sells other tearable packaging tape that gives a very straight, clean edge if that is important to you.  I use this on a dispenser to get clean edges.  The reason for four stars is that I prefer the wider ~2" tape for sealing packages that I send.  This is good, sturdy tape, and I think it's a good product - but it's a thinner than I like to use.  So, I suggest Scotch's 142 tape for this class of tape due to the extra width.  For even sturdier tape, I suggest Scotch filament or bi-directional filament (for very heavy packages) tape.	1
Love these Wypall wipes, they also come in a giant roll as well, but this box is smaller and cheaper (and works in places that don't need or can't have a holder/stand).  They are thick and potentially reusable as well (like a super durable/thick paper towel).  Have a box of these (and the big roll) in the garage, great for cleaning off all kinds of things, cleaning up spills, etc.	1
My father has a few businesses that I occasionally help out with. He orders a variety of Wypall wipes depending on the use. After trying them out I ended up taking some home and found out first hand how much better the Wypall X90s are than the other ones. I liked them so much now I order them for myself. Try them out and you won't be disappointed.	1
Split loom.  Pretty average stuff.  Not super heavy, but not paperweight either.	1

I used the Anvil Pipe Flange to attach a valve to the bottom of a large plastic garbage can. A drilled plate to match on the inside bolted through gives a firm attachment.  I use the big can when I need to mix together several buckets of paint to assure uniform color or if I am mixing a big batch of lawn chemicals of fertalizer.  The valve on the bottom of the can allows easy transfer of any liquid to smaller containers.	1
Abit pricy but solid	1
Perfect!	1
Holds tools but falls down a lot	1
seller should say 1/4 inch if it's true I/4, not being a 1/8 inch product that does not work well at all in a 1/4 inch peg board. These are 1/8. many sellers leave out the problem as saying "fits 1/8 or 1/4, If you use a 1/8 you will have to strap them down.	-1

Handy parts for my Kossel variant 3D printer. No obvious issues with any of the screws.	1
It's a standard shcs  (socket head cap screw) Very solid, hasn't sheared yet great packaging just what I was looking for	1
They look very nice, I really like the finish.  I bought about 20 different metric screws just so I would have them around.  About half of them were from "Brighton Best".  I realized almost immediately that I preferred Brighton over the others.  Everything about them seems superior.. even the packaging (which I admit, is a weird thing to notice). "Brighton Best" has secured a spot on my list of favorite brands.	1
Very bright! you may need to put higher resistor if you try to match intensity with red/green ones.	1

Good quality parts. No garbage threads, no poorly machined head etc. Quality product for a fair price. Steel appears to be a high quality stainless.	1
Great for use with holding bandages on leg where I bashed it against a bed headboard without having to use tape.	1
As others have stated, these are industrial still dust magnets similar to Swiffer, but designed specifically for 3M products.  These perforated sheets allow you to pull just the amount you need for the job.  I didn't particularly like the thick and  "tacky" feel of the sheets and it left some residue on my hands and the floors.  I'd suggest using it with gloves and being careful on delicate surfaces.  Additionally, be careful on floors.  For ceiling fans, bookshelves  and other places where dust is a major problem, these really did the job.	1
good	1
Cut like a broken beer bottle on a honky-tonk floor when you fall down drunk.  Kidding aside, these cut really great and the 5 pack is a deal.	1
If you're used to the incredibly cheap (both ways) cutoff wheels from HF, these will surprise you. They are much more resistant to fracture than the cheapos; this will be important to you if you're sick of being smacked by cheapo wheels flying apart. Also they're twice as thick, but still will work better as a cutoff than as a grinder. They're dished a bit, and that along with the increased thickness makes a much stiffer wheel. They're fairly coarse so good luck smoothing your cuts on the fly.	1
These wheels cut like a hot knife in butter. I do a lot of fabricating, but one thing I really like to do is scrounge and repurpose old steel into new things. This means I do a lot of cutting things apart (and sometimes fix mistakes!) and these wheels cut the fastest of any I have found. They wear down about the same rate as any other, but they just seem to cut faster and faster is good. You won't go wrong with these.	1
Very good	1
I used this to final polish the headlamp plastic on my car after working my way up from 500 grit.  I originally purchased a 3M lens polishing kit but then realized I had the tool (Porter Cable RO polisher) and the pads (abralon in multiple grits), so I ordered this for the final polish.  All I can say is it worked.	1
Works and is accurate.	1
I am very happy with this purchase,	1
Just what I needed. Make sure you use the correct drill bit or you will stip the heads.	1

I have Been keeping Reef Tanks for 31 Years and these Hanna Test kits are the Best ones I have ever used. I moved from the Red Sea pro models that I had to Hanna and I will never look back unless Hanna does not have a kit for what I need. I have used Red Sea, Salifert, API an ELOS and while I have to admire the Bang for the buck with API kits, but the accuracy is just not good enough for serious tanks.  The White case in the picture is the old case, mine came in a much more durable Black case with double latches.  It seems all there kits now use the same black case.  The Alkalinity tester is so easy to use, and the results are very accurate when I compared them against a fresh batch mix of Red Sea Reef Salt Water.  I also get really good repeatability with the measurements and so far I am very happy with this kit.  With the Hanna kits there are a few tricks to getting accurate results, I will be doing a you tube video on that for people to see, needless to say if you dip them in a Tank to fill the vials, after you get the level right and seal the vial, make sure to rinse the outside off and your hands with fresh water and then dry it with a paper cloth and give it a final polish with a reading glasses cleaning cloth.  If you do this and use them properly you get consistent accurate results and the real beauty is that you don't have to look at anymore color charts and the test are so much easier to perform than the old school stuff.  I can do 4 different tests in under 10 minutes and have good results that are repeatable and match what I expect after dosing.	1
Solid construction if you get the right size for the job. I bought the wrong size blindly but am still impressed at how neat and solid these pieces are! My mistake on the size mismatch, good product~	1
I used these to waterproof my battery box for my kayak. I was able to fit a bunch of wires through them, easy to install. I wanted black instead of white so they did take awhile to ship from china.	1

These get the job done. We have over a dozen that we use. Zero failures.	1
For the price this is pretty good.  Not super smooth, but seems repeatable and accurate enough for my needs.  I considered a Starett but those a $100+ and I decided that I don't use this enough to justify.  Before I got this, I bought the iGauging digital/fractional caliper (was the slightly higher cost model they have but was still around $50) - the quality of that caliper was very very good, super smooth and very accurate.  I only returned it because I couldn't really use 1/128th fractions, but wow was that a good bang for the buck.  I then bought this excepting a similar level of quality....but nah, this one isn't the sleeper for excellent quality, but, I don't want to unduly knock this, this seems good and accurate - just the smoothness in the thumbwheel/sliding isn't really there.  Otherwise, very good purchase and I don't regret it.  I would have kept the digital version if you could select a more usable fraction (like rounding to the nearest 1/64th or 32nd would have been a nice feature).	1
Good	1
I have two golden retrievers who shed A LOT, so I'm very picky about vacuum cleaners.  This one falls short.  Here's why:  1.  The suction is inadequate.  Most of the dog fur is picked up, but not all of it.  This was most evident to me when I vacuumed an area rug with a black border.  I had to keep going over the black part until all the hairs were gone.  2.  Open dirt cup.  Why oh why anyone would make a pet vacuum with an open dirt cup is a mystery to me.  The fur fills the cup as well as the filter above.  When you remove the cup to empty it, dirt and hair get everywhere, plus you have to reach above and manually pull the rest of the debri from inside the vacuum.  This is messy and I don't enjoy playing with the stuff I suck out of my carpets.  To make matters worse, the dirt cup is unusually small, so you have to go through this process often.  I just want to vacuum and be done with it.  3.  The side attachment falls off.  Constantly.  I got so aggravated that I threw it in a closet.  4.  Cord is not retractable.  To be fair, most vacuums don't have retractable cords.  I've only had one that was retractable, but it's such a convenient feature.  All in all, if you're looking for a pet vacuum, don't buy this.  I recommend this one instead:  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Eureka-AirSpeed-Pet-Bagless-Upright-Vacuum-AS1002A/dp/B00A2VND0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Eureka AirSpeed Pet Bagless Upright Vacuum, AS1002A</a>	-1

I wish I'd bought 5 of these packs for frequent new & rewiring jobs. Unlike paper tape these markers will last for decades for future wiring repairs/troubleshooting. I like being able to use these to mark factory wiring with their same wire labels per original wiring diagrams.	1
Works as described	1
I used this clamp to bond my hot water, cold water, and gas lines (black pipe) together at my hot water heater.  it works, and the three pack is just what I needed.  If I was to change anything I would have the hole on the top go the other direction so the wire could go perpendicular to the direction of the pipe more easily, but I can imagine other people might want it this way.  Also note: I used 4 gauge stranded wire and it was kind of a pain to get through the hole.  If I had it to do again I'd used non-stranded or stick with 6 gauge.  If you are willing to work with it a while or the wire doesn't need much bending around, you may be fine with 4 gauge stranded.  You can't see i in the photo but when you loosen it up the top part of the clamp swivels open so you can easily put it on pipes without having to slide it over the end or remove the bolts completely.  Nice touch.  I'm satisfied with this product.	1
great cleaning power over our previous model and price very reasonable.  No dislikes.	1
I've put this on my portable band saw that I've mounted vertically. Perfect.	1

I am getting ready to experiment with building my own BLDC motor so I thought a magnetic field viewer would be a great idea.  My suggestion is - don't cheap out.  The idea that this is the size of a credit card is neat, but given the percentage of the viewer material in comparison to the whole, makes this nearly useless.  This is my first magnetic viewer so I wouldn't know exactly what to expect but after fussing with this part that arrived, it seems I wasted more time trying to figure out what I've done wrong as apposed to being productive with a better product.  As another reviewer mentioned, the card is too thick.  It has 2 layers of laminate (one of which would not affect the magnetic field), I assume a printed instruction sheet is just printer paper plus the magnetic material itself.  The first image attached shows a small N45 neodymium magnet and its field.  All the bright colored particles are NOT the magnetic material.  Under a microscope, they seem to be balls of gel.  I don't know how to make this type of material but I believe these balls of gel interfere with the "image" you see,  These balls don't move or change color.  What you see is what you get.  There is also a "speck" of lint or something in the middle of the image.  As another review mentioned, this speck is under the laminate, so it's a permanent fixture in this viewer.  The scratches may or may not have been there upon arrival, but I just got this card today and I don't think I used it that much.  The second photo shows how the product was not even laminated "squarely".  Everything is misaligned and even though it's not a BIG deal, it is bothersome that someone would pay any kind of money for a product that this company didn't care about the assembly or QC of a product before leaving their doors.  Regarding the third photo, I would commend this company by stamping the Made In U.S.A emblem, which makes me happy, but this label nearly kept the laminate from encapsulating the whole thing.  I can imagine this will de-laminate itself in a few weeks with regular use.  I too own my own business and I will also say that my products would never leave my doors with this level of quality.	-1
I didn't read all the description carefully, and thought it was an ESR-oriented LCR meter.  This doesn't do LCR functions at all.  It only reads ESR.  It displays a capacitance value, but it's fictional, varying 10s of percentage points for the exact same capacitor measured a few seconds later.  The ESR value is better, but it still doesn't seem particularly consistent to me.  It will differentiate between a "good" electrolytic cap and one that has gone horribly out of spec, due to electrolyte leakage, for example, but it won't tell you reliably if one capacitor has a lower ESR than another, similar capacitor.  It only goes down to about 1uf, so it's not useful for telling me capacitance for something that doesn't already have it marked on the case.  The description might lead one to believe that the leads are socketed.  The socket is at the tip!  If you need to replace the leads when they break, you have to solder the new ones on the board.  They will break, because the strain relief is what amounts to a little bit of heat-shrink tubing.  Granted, most people who need an ESR meter can solder leads to a board, but I still consider it a point against it.  Also, I got about 7 measurements out of it before the battery died.  Yes, it shipped with a dead battery.  It uses an a23, 12V battery.  Not something I have laying around.  Battery replacement involves taking it all apart, and the battery holder, if one could call it that, inspires no confidence at all.  The positive terminal is literally tinned wire wrapped around the edge of a cutout in the board.  The board isn't secured in the case, other than just being pinched by the halves of the case.  When it's set to silent, it still makes a short chirp/click noise.  It's based on a PIC16 microcontroller, and that only serves to reinforce my view that it's pretty much a very expensive version of a kit ESR meter that would normally sell for a few dollars, maybe a few tens of dollars with assembly. One might get the impression from reading all that it's a bad instrument, and it's really not.  It just lacks the kind of measurement accuracy, repeatability, and versatility that I feel an instrument in this price range should have.  It's perfectly servicable as a repair aid to find a bad cap fast, or to tell if a part is going to be broadly compatible with a particular use case.	-1

This is just ~40g of sodium hydroxide (lye) mixed with 1L of water. You can buy 20x the quantity for the same price if you just look for lye or sodium hydroxide instead of "positive developer". Also, why does it come up in search results when you type "ferric chloride" in the Amazon search? I should have read more and it's on me that I bought it expecting FeCl3, but it's sllly that an ambiguously named product would show up when searching for something totally different. Also, it's non-returnable, so now I'm stuck with a very expensive bottle of lye.	-1

Bought this product to eliminate tools on a 4" dryer duct. So imagine my surprise that the size 60 clamp is just a hair too small to easily fit over the slightly larger outer diameter of flexible semi-rigid dryer ducting. A really genius idea would be to make one (embossed-type) clamp size that works for 3-6 inch semi-rigid flex duct. 2.5 - 7 inch capacity outta do it. Yeah there are universal kits but not embossed. Guess I'll use a regular stainless hose clamp and a screwdriver / socket before using these. Here is an embossed clamp version that should work nicely.

Upon receiving this Variac I opened the box took it out all looked good, Then I plugged it in with no load on it, and the light show started, meaning when the wiper got to the 10 volt range, it started arcing like a dead short, and it caused the lights in my shop to dim. the sparks that shot out could have started a fire. This "Variac" is garbage cheap unsafe junk, this variac should not be sold on amazon or any where else. for all you amazonians out there do not buy this junk it is unsafe. I do understand that we the purchasers try to find I know that this review will be placed at the bottom of the reviews list, but it should be at the top, to warn other purchasers to avoid this unsafe item.	-1

Con: Made in Pakistan hidden from listing.  "Special coating" is paint that will chip off.  It would have been better to leave that off. Pro: Tips do line up well and touch only at tips. Overall I am very disappointed because another pair of Aven tweezers, straight fiber tips, was made superbly in Switzerland.	-1
the v blocks are great, but the clamps broke upon first use, they cast and don't hold up well.  I am going to machine some out of mild steel.	-1
The glass has numerous imperfections, which make it succeptible to breakage and not safe for intended purpose.  Further the glass contains residue on inside from either manufacturing or previous use	-1
Under material it clearly states 10 pcs. From the reviews, it seems as though a lot of buyers thought they were getting ten pieces in a pack. The ad is ambiguous at best. I only deal with companies that make things clear to understand. It helps to avoid misunderstandings and disappointment. Also, I think some companies like it when you misunderstand. This company clearly profits by saying 1 pack (As in one pack of cigarettes) in the header and 10 pcs in their ad copy. A very cleaver seller indeed!  I hope this gets processed through to the proper channels so Amazon can straighten this guy out.	-1
It's thin and it doesn't stick well. If you buy this you will have to use two layers of it, after carefully aligning the pattern.  This thing comes off easily. I haven't tried sealing  it to the surface using a heat gun; maybe that's what it'll take. Buy something else!	-1
These are VERY cheap, thin aluminum.	-1
Does not fit my 1/2 inch pvc pipe at all.. Measured the fitting to be 1-1/2 inches long.. Says 1/2 on it.. Nothing about it is 1/2 inches..	-1
Outrageous price for a single 1/2 slip coupling	-1
Well, I'm no metric guru, but last time I checked 5mm was roughly equal to .20 inch.  The ten chokes I received, although of good quality, are NOT capable of receiving a .20 cable.  ...maybe half that, at best.  Maybe the seller shipped the wrong ones?  As I mentioned, they are of decent quality but not useful to me, and too small to worry about returning.  FWIW, your mileage may vary.	-1
**THIS IS A OLD AND DEPRECATED PRODUCT NO LONGER SUPPORTED BY THE ARDUINO DEVELOPERS**  There are lots of incompatibilities and problems that will never be fixed. I strongly recommend using the updated V2 motor Shield.	-1
Very cheaply made, but on the other hand, I didn't pay a lot. But definitely low quality. Also they were grimy, with oily smudges on them and they stink like bilge oil.	-1
The actual lay flat diameter is around 50mm, nowhere near the 25mm -- if you decide to use this, you can probably use it for wrapping a baseball bat because of how wide it actually is.	-1
It's just not accurate.  It took a while to figure it out and caused some problems as a result.	-1
The posts themselves are good quality but the carbide inserts are not. The tip chips off almost immediately no matter the cut. Would not buy again	-1
These brackets come with caps to cover the screws, which is nice but and by no fault of the manufacturer or distributor, this was simply not what I hoped for in terms of a solution for adding support to a shelf. The brackets are big. awkward and an eyesore -- even after painting them. Plastic, not metal. I'm assuming that it is because they are plastic they do not provide much in terms of support -- even with a small shelf. Two stars.	-1
Just bought this week for 2000 GMC 1 ton and even with truck in reverse gear on moderate hill the truck crushed this block... 9800 gvw. It is hollow inside, heavy and thick but hollow and no go! The current information says this is a solid rubber block but I assure you it is not.	-1
Many of these have sporadic readings, and will cause my inputs to go to max or min values when i squeeze the case, will not buy again!	-1
don't waste your money half of them don't even work and the other half are very erratic.	-1
When I received the product and read the directions, I was impressed. The mixing bottle that's included is cool. Marked clearly, seems impossible to mix incorrectly. I poured the harder to the first line, then the resin up to the second line, screwed the cap on to the mixing bottle and shook for over a minute. The product looked totally mixed. Then the problem..... application. This stuff is like water. I am in Tucson, temp was 84 degrees. The directions say one hour set up time...Ha! If your application includes any vertical needs, forget it. This stuff ran everywhere and made a huge mess. It sat 12 hours in Tucson Arizona and never set completely. Trust me, you can't make a mistake mixing it using the mixing/squeeze application bottle. This was a huge waste of my time and money. All I have now is a big mess to clean up. Worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon.	-1
RETURNED IT , BAT PRODUCT, I JUST RECEIVED PART OF THE CREDIT.  I WILL REMEMER...	-1
The buttons don't lock very well. If you tighten or loosen them some you can possibly get them working. Not worth the price really.	-1
Not impressed. It says it is contact cement, but real contact cement grabs on contact and does not move. This stuff does definitely not do that. 72 hours to fully set up? Please. That's not contact cement.  I followed instructions; cleaned both surfaces with rubbing alcohol, applied glue to both pieces, let set up for two minutes, and stuck them together.  That was yesterday. Today it still hasn't fully bonded.	-1
There is a rod that guides the clamp which runs in the center of the open clamp. On my second time to use the clamp I never felt it when I drilled through it. It's a fatal flaw in my opinion. Definitely wouldn't recommend for anyone to purchase this item.	-1
The nut on the end gets in the way.  Hunt for one with a screw on the end.	-1
Much cheaper than it looks. It won't last and it's client device is loose (completely separate device) so it's prone to be lost.	-1
broke in 1 week	-1
much better tape out there, doesnt stick good.	-1
Doesn't print well. I'm an experienced 3d printer who has used a number of other brands and despite tweaking temperature and extrustion rates I can't get good interlayer bonding with this ABS. If your projects are functional I would advise avoiding this ABS.	-1
This SainSmart ABS filament worked very well for most of the spool.  Towards the end, I found that there was a huge tangle in the filament with about 20% of the filament remaining on the spool.  It caused my printer some difficulty, which I eventually got straightened out.  The spool was removed from the printer and thrown away at that point.  Too much of a tangle to bother trying to straighten out.  Fairly displeased, but the filament printed well enough up to that point, hence the 2-star rating.  I have another spool of SainSmart 1.75mm filament, but now I'm a bit concerned about having it do the same thing this spool did.	-1
but that doesn't work for reviews so here goes:  DeWalt took a concept that Bosch created in (B005EM93R0) and ATTEMPTED to copy it but while the Bosch tool isn't correct 100% of the time, this DeWalt tool isn't correct 25% of the time. This thing would be funny as a icebreaker for contractors but is honestly down right dangerous. It misreads things that you should avoid as other items like calling a electrical line a wood stud (think about how bad that is for a minute) or water pipes that don't show up at all until you drill into them.  The idea behind this product is a VERY GOOD one but this actual product is so bad that DeWalt has taken it off the market all together after being released less than a year.  If you happen to have one of these rare birds, play this game with friends. Pick a section of wall and slowly scan the wall, marking with post it notes what is located where. Then have another person do the same thing...backwards. Then have a 3rd person scan forward again (each time using post it notes to mark what the device is telling you is in your wall).  Not only will this "gem" read the wall incorrectly, it will normally read it different every time it is scanned. It sort of makes you wonder if this is just a screen and a random item generator shipped as a product filler because the real thing wasn't completed yet.  I would warn you to stay away but the manufacturer has removed that from being a problem so we can just enjoy the humor in all of this.	-1
did not work so well	-1
I'm mainly going to compare this toothbrush with my Oral-B that I bought a year ago for half the price: http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Precision-Rechargeable-Electric-Toothbrush/dp/B008PEMOV6/  The reason why? Well, because it's half the price of this Panasonic and that just seems outrageous to me. I've been going back and forth between the brushes for the last month since I received this one for review and I have to say I like them both and I don't see a noticeable difference in cleaning skill.  So let's talk about the pros and cons...  Pros: Gentle clean. I don't feel like it eats away at your gums. This is probably the strongest feature of the sonic. It's nice on my gums. However, the Oral-B leaves my teeth noticeably squeakier-clean and it has a "gentle" head that you can use in conjunction with the "gentle" setting... so the advantage of this toothbrush kinda disappears in that regard.  The pointy head. THIS head is GREAT! It can get in-between all the hard spots and even around behind some of my wisdom teeth in the back and it's probably the one reason why I use this one more often than my old Oral-B. It's great and "almost" flosses my teeth. I have two spots in my teeth that capture food and my gums are always so inflamed and itchy there... and this brush helped that TREMENDOUSLY because I could actually brush my gums most of the way in there and it helped to lessen the inflammation. The flossing was irritating it but necessary and so this fills a gap that I didn't have covered before.  This toothbrush DEFINITELY has an advantage over the Oral-B just for this head.  The 3rd head: the rubber gum one, is silly, if you ask me. :D  Timer.  It pauses once each time you are supposed to go to the next quarter, and pauses twice when you 2 minutes is up. However, the Oral-B out-performs because it SHOWS you on your little picture where you are supposed to be and it's EASY to hear the beeps, etc... the Panasonic was harder.  Holds a long charge. Huge advantage here over the Oral-B. I think I could take it on a week long trip and not have to bring the charger, it's that good.  That being said, there are cons simply because there are features on my Oral-B that this does NOT have:  Goes gentle when you press hard. I know the Panasonic SAYS it goes gentle if you press hard but I CANNOT get it to. I've even pressed it HARD on my finger and heard/felt/saw no difference! The Oral-B backs off visibly when you press hard and a red warning light goes on your "screen".  Bad head storage. They send you three heads and you can only store two on the brush... so of course you have one on the counter then. The Oral-B sends one head and has *4* slots for heads. Great for the hubby and I to share the same brush with different heads.  ****************  So really, to sum things up: The Oral-B is a much better, economical choice and does a better job cleaning with the exception of the little pointy head on the Panasonic. I just can't see shelling out $100 for that head alone and so I don't think it's worth the price. If I hadn't gotten it free for review there's no WAY I would have spent this money on it.  Especially since the Oral-B has additional features that I didn't mention here that make it more valuable.  Don't get me wrong, the Panasonic is a GREAT toothbrush... but when you can buy something a little better for half the price... is it really great anymore? If it were $100 or even $110 I could justify the price for that extra head... but not any higher.	-1
The delivered Item was not as described. The seller promised a product Provided at the  Image as: Dual Scale Borosilicate Beaker, 250ml Brand: Lab Zap Labeled Borosilicate, 250 ml and market up to 250ml. The delivered Item is different: Brand: BOMEX Labeled 250ml, but market up to 200ml Not labeled as Borosilicate. Borosilicate glass is manufactured from two main components, silica and boron oxide.  The mixture of these two components create glass that is resistant to thermal shock due to the very low coefficient of thermal expansion.  Borosilicate glass can withstand severe temperature changes without breaking.  It also has a high resistance to chemicals. Pyrex marketed by Corning Glass has become a synonym for borosilicate glass.  Kimble also sells its own line of Kimax brand borosilicate glass products. Brand: Zap Lab  borosilicate Beaker is labeled as Borosilicate. This beaker is made from quality borosilicate glass. As an import, it is less expensive than Corning-made Pyrex. We have noticed variation of wall thickness and make a suggestive comment that Pyrex uniformity might be preferable if using higher heat. This is the Beaker the seller listed, but delivered a totally different one. Brand: BOMEX doesn't Label Borosilicate, and we do not know for sure what material it is.	-1
Don't waste your money. It wrinkles the more you use definitely more time consuming than an oil slick pad and way over priced compared to regular parchment paper. Not as easy to work with as others have reviewed, a pad or ordinary parchment is what I went back to.	-1

Editing my review.  After lots of research, I've discovered that these are not germanium.  Anything labeled 1N60P are ALL Schottky diodes.  These may be okay for low power.  However, they don't compare to real germanium diodes when it comes to crystal radios.  There seems to be a lot of people out there classifying 1N60P as "Germanium", which they absolutely are not.  They may work as replacements in a lot of cases, but they are still not Germanium.  Two stars for the deception/lack of knowledge of the product you are selling.	-1

I used Zen's Natural PLA and loved it, so I ordered their black PLA.  USELESS.  I tried many temperatures, and it always plugs the nozzle.  After about 30 plugs and ZERO successful prints I drilled out the extruder body.  It still plugged repeatedly.  I wonder if they take advantage of the black color to hide fillers in it?  DO NOT BUY.	-1
When it works it's fine, but lots of repairs.  W/ the canister off, the kids were able to drop items down to the vacuum motor (2 motor replacements), the brush motor has always been sporadic... kicking on and off.  It initially clogged up easily w/ new carpet.  Broken brush belt. Giving up on it w/ the brush motor issues getting worse now.  I had hoped it would last longer than 3yrs - but buying it reman'd it didn't cost too much/yr - still i just want them to be a durable good... 8-10yrs - work w/ only minor repair and filter replacements.	-1

This stuff is a real bear to print with. I have had so many problems with it. I do not think I was able to even get one good print from the entire spool. It will not stick to the bed. I tried everything including Garolite which is what the manufacture recommends. Tried it on a Makerbot and a Printrbot. Both had the same issue. It also has trouble adhering to itself as well. Final print can be separated by layers with little trouble. Tried everything to correct these issue all to no avail. Printed at 240c, also tried higher temps as well. Nothing helped. Tried lower temps. Even over level bed to insure it would stick well on first layer. Did not help much. Product is useless. Also emits smoke and pops allot.	-1
I'll have to update once I get it dry.. but initially... SO wet.. I've printed with off the shelf string trimmer line and it was MUCH more dry than this.  Trying to print this sounds like frying chicken.  Unusable as is.  Steam forcing ooze out horribly.. unusable.  Has a descant in the bag.. but no where near enough protection apparently  Comes in a sandwich bag type material.  Not vac packed.	-1
Have tried different temperatures, speed and no luck.  As of right now a waste of time and money until I get time to experiment more.	-1
This will probably be my very first 0/1 star rating in memory.  I ordered the first Reed switch for an LED cabinet project, which failed to work. The plan was to have the light come on when the door is open (closed switch), go off when closed (open switch).  My electrician and I could not get the switch to activate/deactivate the light.  He put a meter on the switch and found that it was defective (switch would not open, no matter where the magnet was placed) , so I ordered a second switch.  The replacement Reed switch also proved to be defective, verifying this with a meter.  So, we opted for a more traditional push button cabinet switch, which works flawlessly.  I had no issues with the order, shipping, packaging, or instructions.  I can only assume that the seller received a batch of defective switches.	-1
broke down right after i installed it, by the instructions.	-1
I wanted this as a quick change out socket for Atmel 328 chips. The pictured item would work fine. It is not what I received though. The sockets I received were very widely spaced with no way a dip chip could be inserted. Total junk and pitched in the trash.	-1
Poor box and it was broken upon delevery. Returned it	-1
Radiator fins are to compact, blocking 90% of airflow, even with use of pressure fans. I got more blowback then anything else. There is not way to mount these radiators, as there are no threads in the holes, and the rad fins prevent you from even passing through a bolt. And brand new from the box, about a dime size section of fins were completely bent over.	-1
You get what you pay for.  These are cheap, and don't last nearly as long as 3M or other higher quality items. Also, the ROLOC fit is poor and the discs ten to spin off the pad when stopping the air tool. Won't buy again.	-1
very unhandy	-1
THIS  is NOT a REAL K-type compliant connector.  It is NOT made of Alumel and Chromel which are the metals used in a K-type thermocouple wire.  A REAL connector IS made of CH and AL.  Typically, the plugs have AL and CH stamped on the exposed portion of the blades.  The jacks will say CH and AL also.  On jacks it is printed on the yellow plastic somewhere along with a + and a - for polarity.  AL is MAGNETIC, CH is NOT. If  both of your connector's metal parts ARE magnetic OR both are NOT, THAT is another way to tell your connector is NOT a REAL K connector.  If you use this you absolutely WILL introduce error into your readings because the junctions created by attaching the connectors to the wires and plug will turn this into a thermocouple as well since you will have alumel connected to a DIFFERENT metal, and chromel connected to a DIFFERENT metal... whatever metal IT is.!!!  Real cute in the ad. They CALL it a K-type yet DON'T tell you it isn't made of the correct metals and therefore NOT compliant!  NEVER, EVER, EVER buy this if you want accurate readings from a actual thermocouple.  EXAMPLES:  Scenario A:  TC Chromel and Alumel--->Fake Plug--->measuring equipment.  In this configuration, The TC,  as well as the connections IN the PLUG are also t-couple junctions.  The connection IN THE jack is where it SHOULD be.  Scenario B: TC Chromel and Alumel--->Fake Plug--->Fake Jack--->K-type wire--->Fake Plug---> measuring equipment.  In this configuration which uses a extension cable, The TC, the connections IN the PLUG AND again IN the jack of the first plug/jack set AND IN the second plug are ALL t-couple junctions!  Heating or cooling any of them WILL change your reading!  IF they all were REAL plugs and jacks, the ONLY places affected by temperature would be the t-couple weld (Sensor) and the JACK of the test equipment and NOTHING else.  Cute how they conveniently omit this fact and still call them K-type no?	-1
This s a very small box of very small nails or almost pins. The only sizable nails are the large ones shown in the box. Should have just gone to Ace.	-1
This is a dandy little switch. I am using it to switch power sources for a the refrigerator in my RV and it works fine. The terminals are a little small, though, so really not practical for solid wire larger than 14 gauge. Maybe not larger stranded wire either, since the terminal screws don't have broad heads to clamp the stands. I would buy it again, though, if it fit my wire size requirements for a DPDT switch.  UPDATE 8/29/2016: Update: The switch failed internally and literally melted after just 4 months of use and never carrying more than 3 amps of current @ 120v. The switch may be rated for 15A power, but it is physically designed for only light gauge wires, probably no more than 18 gauge. I believe the mechanical stress of having 6 x 14 ga wires attached was too much for it and broke the internal contacts somehow. Either that, or the 15A switch rating is pure fiction.  I withdraw my earlier recommendation and advise against this switch for any use.	-1
Crap plastic. Does not bond well. Does not stick to bed at all except with think acetone slurry. Leaves flakes and particles of itself everywhere. My bowden tube is still pumping out yellow dust into my extruder thanks to this. Stay away from Octave.	-1

Signstek DS211 has been delivered without any user instruction manual in English or an internet link to it. It has INPUT and OUTPUT sockets but no cable has been supplied to feed Square wave to check the DS211 working. It is useful only to 40Vac, as only 1X1 probe has been supplied (unlike DSO201 with 1X1 and 1X10). The script reads poorly on screen (DSO201 was better). Could it improve by downloading Benf software upgrade? I have not used it so far.	-1
worst experience ever!!!!!	-1
The unit I received is not Detecting at a 4 mm Distance, more like 2mm. Not functioning with my 3D printer, by the time the sensor detects metal, the nozzle has pushed down into my bed. I would return it, but after cutting the cable and pinning it as needed, it is not likely to be refundable. I Double checking the wiring and voltages (12.23Vdc) for error, there are none. This product has no quality control, to validate it's functional to specifications another product is strongly recommended.	-1
Shipping was very slow. I bought this to replace the zprobe on my migbot printer. After connecting the probe, it will light up (dimly) when it senses the metal, but is not enough to trip the limit switch on the control board.  The probe I received was blue instead of the orange one pictured and was very thin.  I ordered one that was 2 dollars more and it works perfect.	-1
This thing always has a voltage on the signal leg, which makes it pretty useless for my purpose.	-1
This tape is very very thin in does not stick very well the one I got before this one what's the same has Hurley nonstick and does not stay on things that well I taped it on cardboard box it would not stay stuck if I could return it I would because it's no good to stay I talk to my roommate he said this tape is more for using into meet market on meat packaging it Is not very good Dottie and I'll the yellow tape that bought has excellent stick in Hall's up a long time I cannot recommend this tape here to anyone it will keep your packages Secure it works on paper but on anything else it does not have a good stick and Rich too easy sincerely William Tyler	-1
There are the worst vises I have ever used. I bought two with the intention of mounting them side by side. First problem is if you cannot use them without the swivel base. If you try to bolt them down without the base they will warm and will no longer clamp. My older 6" vise by the same company(HHIP) works great without the swivel base. It has more meat in it and much better built. These are cheap junk. Second problem is when mounting them side by side they are 0.0115" difference in height. This makes them unusable without shimming. The workmanship and general quality has gone away with these vises. The old ones I have use 10+ years old. Work great to this day. These were junk out of the gate. They made them with so much less material it compromised the usability. Don't waist your money.	-1
tl;dr Go with a MonopriceMini for almost 1/3 of the price pros: sleek enclosure, will teach you everything you will ever need to know about troubleshooting a 3d printer cons: too many to list  The first one arrived obviously used with the previous customers shipping information still on the interior box... a few days past the guaranteed delivery date. I immediately returned it. The second one arrived and I was stoked!  Upon unboxing and setting it up, I realized that the printer wasn't talking to my laptop via USB. OSX, Windows, and a Linux box for good measure... Nothing but communication errors or errors that sensors were not detected. After an hour or so of google foo, I came to realize that this printer DOES IN FACT have a micro SD card. It is just conveniently located on the circuit board within the metal enclosure . After pulling the case apart the metal case, I discovered that the micro sd card was not seated properly on the circuit board. I popped the sd card in place, put the case back together and I was stoked to start printing!  *I had already learned the software included was garbage and mostly written in broken English at this point by following the included setup guide.  I follow instructions... Initialize, Maintenance -> calibrate the platform... extrude... etc. The Extruder was jammed. Haven't even printed and the extruder is jammed. I learned this after hours of looking into nozzle clog issues. (The nozzle was clogged as well). I took apart the extruder assembly, and removed the crusty old white filament that was jamming it up (likely from a test print prior to shipping). I then cleared the nozzle and confirmed the extruder was good to go. (this required acetone, time, and patience)  NOW, I was stoked to start printing!  The first few prints were glorious. Not the quality, but the fact that I finally had it working. Then came more problems. As previously mentioned, the software is some of the worst I have ever seen. The UI and UX is a joke. Switching filaments was a guaranteed jam in my case no matter the extruder temp. Doesn't matter if its PLA to PLA, ABS to PLA, PLA to ABS, etc. Withdraw and Extrude in the maintenance panel all you like. You're going to be pulling it apart and putting it back together before you have any progress.  The software CHOOSES what temp is best for you. THIS should have been a huge red flag when I first got my feet wet. There are lots of 'mods' and 'hacks' online to get this POS to print how you want, but for the price, I shouldn't have to potentially void  warranty to make a product work by fixing things.  I would say 2/3 of my time was been spent researching and troubleshooting as opposed to printing, and that is lowballing it. I am very grateful that I have learned enough to possibly teach a college course on troubleshooting a 3d printer after owning this piece of hardware.  The return process was a PITA as well. I am so happy Amazon did good on their part and refunded my money. I'm in week two with the Monoprice mini and I love the little guy so much, I'm getting his bigger brother. BOTH of which could have been purchased for LESS than this UP! product.  I will never purchase anything from UP! again, and will tell others to do the same. Good riddance.	-1

This is the one of worst filaments I have ever had, and I have had some pretty bad stuff. The only reason I got it was I needed it for same day delivery and my normal brands were out of stock.  The spool is a mess, full of tangles, looks like a kid made it. This was not fun getting untangled the first few layers. I noticed some steam/smoke at first thought it was interesting as usually only filaments like nylon do that. I thought maybe it was just this mixture of pla was like that, but unfortunately it ended up coming out pretty bad.  See the attached picture, as the first layer had huge issues, and I will update this review with more prints. I average about 15 prints a week, and never have issues like this, using my PEI build plate which is ironically from gizmo dorks.	-1
This product should remove made in usa label. It is total garbage and in fact I highly doubt it is een true. Bought another blue one on amazon different brand, chinese brand and its much better for same price. Dont bother with this one.	-1
These connectors are not worth the money you pay for them. First, the supposed silver plated contacts are not silver plated, they are TINNED!. Second the connectors WILL NOT fit on 10 gauge wire, they barely work on 12 gauge wire. I have purchased 45 amp power poles before so I know how they work and what wires they fit on. These are not the genuine article, look elsewhere for the proper power pole connectors.	-1
I bought this to cover the bed of a 3D printer. I can't get it to unroll and lay flat enough to use for it's intended usage.	-1
Well, filament is filament is filament.  I purchased this particular filament with certain expectations.  I now find that these expectations were unrealistic and poorly formulated.  I "expected" this to print a little more clear.  I "expected" this to adhere to itself when it printed.  I get the clear part.  It was an unfounded expectation.  The adhesion thing though, that's different.  All filament starts off clear and they add pigment to it to give it it's color.  Why should the lack of pigment cause poor adhesion?  The one star rating is for the adhesion issue, not the clarity issue.  This is not a filament that I plan to stick with....	-1

When it worked it worked well from 140khz to 660khz. Fed test signals over the appropriate  range of the meter it failed to lock on any frequencies outside of that range. My unit was nearly useless for anything but 2 meter.  Now a few weeks after it arrived, it will only indicate "no signal".  I used a ten dollar gift certificate to get it, so I'm out five bucks. I wouldn't have taken a chance on such a low rated product if it weren't that my risk was so low. After fifty years of electronics purchases, I can safely say this is this the least useful product I have received to date. Save your fifteen dollars and put it towards a unit in the fifty to one hundred dollar range to avoid frustration.	-1
It's not working with Weld-on #16. Glue starts to dissolve rubber in the plunger almost immediately. You can see that glue starts to darken (yellowing) around plunger. This happens to many syringes but not those that are intended for Weld-on #16.  Didn't see issues with Weld-on #3. Also movement of the plunger is not very smooth, but it's not terrible.	-1
I purchased this generator with high hopes of receiving a good quality product.  After a 30 minute warm-up, I used my Techtronic and Siglent digital oscilloscopes to check the wave forms.  I noted that at the lowest, default settings the generator put out a great looking waveform.  However, when I changed the frequency from 1KHz to 10KHz, the sine wave began to distort.  I checked the square wave and it too was distorted beyond any form of Square Wave shape.  I returned the generator and Amazon was excellent in getting me an identical replacement.  Unfortunately, that too was just as defective.  Not only did the waveforms distort, the voltage levels were no where close to the generator's settings. I returned this unit to Amazon and got a refund.  I immediately ordered an off-brand .1KHz to 60MHz arbitrary waveform generator for about 50% of the cost.  When it arrived, I put it through some basic tests and the waveforms were excellent; great sine, square, saw, etc.  And voltages were spot on.  I don't know what happened in the Siglent factory, but their QC was not up to par to catch the problems with the two generators that I got.	-1
Really cheap little hinges	-1
Filament has terrible thermal qualities. Extremely poor layer adhesion. Most prints WILL experience some level of layer splitting, regardless of nozzle diameter to layer height ratio. Printed with a Lulzbot TAZ 6 with many different settings/temperatures. I have had no problem with any other ABS 3mm filaments but every spool from Gizmo Dorks has been horrendous. Will not buy again from this vendor.	-1

Haven't got one successful print yet. Prints fail half way through after the extruder chews up the filament. Tried drying it twice and on two different printers. Same problem every time. Color is nice though.	-1
I think this part is neither here or there.  A lot of people seem to have received something different.  I definitely did not receive what was displayed in the photo.  The unit I got is about half the size claimed and shown in the photo.,  The cable is also not 6".  The cable on mine is about 3 feet long.  I also highly doubt what I got would be able to handle 220VAC @ 10A (2200W).  I'm in the US where the maximum power you can use with standard outlets is 120VAC @ 15A (1800W).  15A house wire is 14AWG; with jacket is already the diameter of the entire wire that my foot switch came with, so there is no way I'm plugging this into my house current.  I also wanted to verify continuity of the switch so I broke out my multi-meter.  I was getting static on the continuity and figured I wasn't holding the probes on the connector very well.  When I got a firmer grip on everything, I noticed static was reduced but it would only 'beep' in some positions and not others.  Definitely in the fully-depressed position, there was no continuity.  In the normal position, there is also no continuity.  I flipped the DMM to resistance and the switch has a 1.2 Mohm resistance in the normal position.  I figured I got a foot volume control, but as I feathered the switch, the resistance would drop from 1.2 Mohm to 0 ohms.  So it's not a pot either.  If it was a pot, perhaps I could use it as an AMP-control on my TIG welder, but I already have a heavy duty foot control for that.  So, at $5-6, it would cost me that much to return it, so I got a piece of junk, not what is described.  Not even what other reviewers got.  The unit I got has two screws at the bottom which holds a steel plate with 4 rubber feet.  There is no signs of any way to pop the rest of the switch open to even modify it to work properly.  Gone are the days when Amazon would refund your money for defective or wrong items (low cost).  Now you pay a restocking fee, plus you cover UPS costs for the return.  **** Update **** With persistence, I was able to figure out how to open my unit.  It looks nothing like the reviewer John C's photos.  I have leaf contacts with a resistor network.  I haven't taken any photos of it, but for sure, I did not get the described product.  I CAN make this work for me by bypassing all the resistors, but that's sort of besides the point of this review.	-1
super cheap price and quality. That being said the one I used worked on the solar light I wanted to fix.	-1
I purchased one of these in 2014 and have since come to dislike the printer, the filament and the company.  I supported them in the beginning and provided that support in my product review.  I also supported their printer filament program believing that they had the key to product quality.  I have since changed my mind about the filament program, the product and, especially, the company. My printer is still working, but, as always, it almost works well.....but not quite.  Now the company has gone 'big time' with Sams Club, and thus Walmart.  I must say that Walmart has dragged the company down to it's level, or is it the other way?  It is certainly not an improvement in the previously minimal customer service and consumer support has degraded from poor to virtually non-existent.	-1
A fabulous junction box with just one GIANT mistake.  This junction box has 6 openings in the back.  These have different sizes depending upon the cable AWG (aka Romex) used.  These openings are marked, #14, #12, #10. Well first, you can't read these markings on the box when it is attached to the stud and sheet rock is on the other side. Moreover, you'll have a very hard time getting #12 or #10 cable in the #14 opening.  Every other plastic junction box I have ever used will permit #14, #12, or #10 Cable to go into ANY opening without a struggle.  If not for this design mistake this product would be 5 stars easily.	-1
It is not tape, nor is it shrink tape. I have never used a shrink tape that does not stick long enough to heat it. Also when heated it does not seal. What am I doing wrong with this tape and do the same thing with a good product that really works. I already opened it and tried it several times,, crap!	-1
Pure crap. Don't waste your money. Thin, cheap, won't stay in place so you can apply heat. Just useless. I threw it in the trash.	-1
Like some have reported, this piece can be bent. Mine was bent very slightly, one with a straight edge held down on one side, the there was a ~1mm  gap on the other side. this isn't a huge deal breaker. The real reason I removed a star was because of the deep scratch going from one side to the other and the many small scratches along one of the sides. There is film protecting one side of the sheet and even the protected side has some scratches. Not sure why they didn't protect both sides.  These issues aren't deal breakers for me but it could be for others.	-1
It's way undersized would not feed consistently 2.65mm after a couple of feet	-1

Does not fuse. Rips. Doesn't stretch. I used "rescue tape" and F4 and they actually worked. I used other colors from this company and none of them worked.	-1
I wanted it to work but it didn't so my pipe is still leaking! The tape was much shorter then discription!	-1

not what I thought; my bad..	-1
Hillman DOES NOT use industry standard measurements.  They include 1 inch for the eye instead of measuring only the threaded portion. The bolts are good, but make sure you order a bolt 1 inch longer than you want.  Also, the last 1/2 inch is not threaded and technically shortens the actual bolt length by 1 1/2 inches. 3 stars on the bolts, lowered to 1 star for not following industry standards.	-1
The internal size is NOT 2mm and does not work for my 3D printer. My 1.75mm filament only fits if you force it in. The tubing is also not Semi-Transparent as stated in the description it is a solid white color. DO NOT BUY FOR 3D PRINTER.	-1
2 failed units delivered- gave up, found a better quality regulator for more than 2X the price- worth every penny	-1
These are real bad - they are in their normal form, useless... to make them work, you need to go to each clip, undo the bit that holds the wire in place, then cut a new wire and weld it properly to the clip.  The wires that come with these is very poor quality and the way they make contact on the clips is very poor as well, therefore if you're working with power applications they are terrible - but if you're working with signal based applications then they are fine.  I salvaged most by replacing the wire with a good wire and soldering them together - this made a nice test lead..	-1
JUNK... completely unusable. I ordered 2 packs (4 bearings total) and each bearing had issues. Two were misaligned in their flange (which is fixable) and 3 of the 4 did NOT roll smoothly with either flat spots on balls or debris within the grease. It's kind of amazing that there's a factory out there shipping "ball bearings" that are defective.	-1
I got this printer hoping that it would be better than my Printrbot Makers Edition 1405 printer with XL Upgrade - able to print 4" x 7.3" x 7.3".  My old printer was built from a kit and I installed a number of upgrades.  The printer has auto-leveling, just like Simple Metal.  My printer arrived with a number of problems.  After I went through the calibration guide, I needed to replace Z axis acme threaded rod and plastic Z axis nut.  The rod was bent and the thread inside the plastic nut was destroyed.  The prints were U-shaped on the Y axis.  I had submitted a ticket with support and after a month of back and forth I got my 90 day warranty voided.  I got my printer in the beginning of December and I am still trying to get it working.  I've used Printrbot printers in the past and the quality is getting worse.  I don't know how many printers Printrbot sells, quality might be getting worse because they are trying to sell more printers.  It takes a long time to get a reply from support tech.  On multiple occasions I've received emails that it would take support more than a week to respond to my request due to large demand.  It looks that they only have 4 support technicians.  I've assembled my printer before and I was thinking that I will save a lot of time by buying assembled printer.  It's better if you buy a printer and build it yourself.  If you follow step by step instructions, you will do a better job.  Hot End on the printer is leaking filament non-stop.  I had to change setting in Cura in order to print first layer successfully.	-1
God I used to love this stuff but I unfortunately have to update it with bad news, The last roll I got was beyond brittle, if that wasn't bad enough It was filled with tangles that kept killing 7 or 8 hour prints. (as seen in the photos). I used to only buy Hatch box but when a filament that is half the price ends up being better stuff and won't kill your prints you have few options but to abandon what used to be your got to. ONE more CHANCE if this roll is junk I'm just using my Sainsmart and Amolen in the future.	-1
I bought this red filament for a client project. Each of these lamp shades takes almost 9 hours to print. The smaller of the two was a failure because the filament has a 2.5cm section that is 2.7mm wide. That's nearly a millimeter too large. I haven't had problems with the other Hatchbox colors but I'm anxious about the rest of this project.	-1
This filament was abysmal. This is the second box of Hatchbox I've purchased that's caused harm/damage to my printer. The filament kept getting jammed -- it turned out it was a combination of poor spooling on the reel, and the fact  that the filament was faulty. I had to snip the filament during one of the jams and the filament literally turned to black dust -- The powdered dye used in creating the filament had separated from the filament itself. I've spent the past three hours disassembling and cleaning the hotend of my printer just to get it back to a functional state again.	-1
As received the can of acrylic solvent cement had approximately 1 ounce of solvent in it compared to the 4 ounces that it should have contained. Either the can had a defective cap seal or it was not filled with 4 ounces originally.	-1
This filament is different than any other brand I've tried.  It has a very rough/matte finish with no shine at all.  It adheres to the bed and itself poorly.  Objects I've printed have an exceptionally layered look.  I bought this because Amazon was out of stock on&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/3D-Solutech-Real-White-1-75mm-PLA-3D-Printer-Filament-2-2-LBS-1-0KG-100-USA/dp/B00ME7E5X0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">3D Solutech Real White 1.75mm PLA 3D Printer Filament 2.2 LBS (1.0KG) - 100% USA</a>&nbsp;and Hatchbox.  Hopefully, they will be back in stock soon and I can return to those brands that have been very good to me.	-1
This filament doesn't print like PLA at all. It smells, and it shrinks when it cools down (the edges lift up). My prints came out far worse than when using other PLA.  On the upside the color is good.	-1

This roll is tangled. Constantly knots up about 1 - 2 hours into a print. I've gone through about a dozen rolls from multiple suppliers and this is the only tangled roll I've ever had to deal with.	-1
Low quality PLA. Did not print well and I had to go much slower. It also warped. I suspect it's mixed with some ABS?  Skip this and get some hatchbox or inland.	-1
I RECOMMEND THIS INSTEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
Small reel arrived in an unsealed package with no desiccant. Did not print well out of the box. Buy Hatchbox or similar PLA and skip MakerBot.	-1
shows 3 rolls, only 1 sent.......kinda like false advertising.....but its on me, not again	-1
I purchased these to store acrylic paints for my 25mm miniatures. They seemed to work great at first. I do not recommend them for this, or any purpose.  The lid is cheaply made and if over-tightened just slightly, it will crack the very top part of the cap off. If the lid doesn't fail (more often than not it will) then the nipple dropper insert will split and cause it to leak everywhere and clog the lid.  The bottles themselves seem to made of decent material but the lid and nipple insert are cheap garbage. I now have to replace all of them and potentially throw out some of my paints.	-1
Tubing has about an 1.8mm ID which is slightly too small for my flashforge creator pro. In comparison the teflon tubing supplied with my printer which is listed as an ID of 2mm is actually 2mm. You can fit the filament through but it's too tight on this tubing.  However, this is within Fluorotherm's tolerances [...] so just beware that yours may be on the low side of the tolerance.	-1
Short! Roughly 30.5 CM or 9 inches long. I had misread the description and was expecting 2 meters in length. However, the description does say that there is supposed to be 1 foot of tubing. (1' is the short form of 1 foot.) Not only was it too short for my expectation, but it was shorter then the description says it will be.	-1
I purchase a couple of these and both were of poor quality.  One had a scratched up LCD, the other looked like it had been used for a year, and both have incredibly weak buttons.  I can't attest to their customer service because I honestly didn't bother to try to contact them.  However using the Yosoo GM328 LCD  and the Lexpon DIY Multifunction Tester.	-1
Color stays on end of pen when done, therefore you can't just go to another print without cleaning. I would just recommend an acetone vapor bath for any parts you want smooth	-1
Good idea, but the felt tip turns completely floppy within a few minutes of use. Wanted to like it, worked fine for a few minutes, but is all but worthless now after maybe 10 minutes.	-1
Left handed threads? And the felt tip bends.... not worth the $6 they are asking....maybe $1 and I'd buy 6 and then I could use all 6 to get through a simply 3d project	-1
Worked perfectly at the begining, but after a week of light use it died. The start button won't click anymore.	-1
Defective. Where the ribbon from the LCD meets the PCB, it was misaligned and had several solder bridges. The metal bezel that holds the LCD glass down was bent up and didn't seem to be tight.  Amazon, don't remove this - this next part is NOT part of packaging feedback. Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection is a part of the item itself.  Additionally, this had no ESD protection bag. It should have been in a silvery grey static shielding bag, instead it was wrapped in staticky foam then wrapped in packing tape. Shame on you.	-1
Identical to the CircuitSpecialists 3010SW - same unit, different name on the bezel. Developed a hard short across AC input, blew a thermistor (that they use as an inrush current limiter) in half. No warranty to speak of. It was fine while it lasted, but they will fail on you without warning.	-1
Developed a hard short across the AC input within 5 minutes of being turned on.  Current meter shows 20mA draw when nothing is connected to it.  Virtually no dampening of the output, so it can take up to 5 seconds to reach the voltage set by the knob if it's lightly loaded.  Worst part is the way the voltage is set.  Once the coarse control is set to minimum, the fine control no longer does anything.  So you cannot set a low voltage such as 0.5V at all.  Looks like it was designed by someone that had no clue what they were doing or it was adapted from another design without understanding how it works.	-1
This filament came in a NON-vacuum sealed plastic bag with No desiccant.  Meaning it was saturated with moisture and immediately clogged my nozzle...  After dehydrating in the oven at 160 for 8 hours, I was able to print for 2 hours, then hit more moisture saturated filament.  I ended up throwing this filament out after using less than 100ft...  Very disappointed.	-1
Apparently, Tapecase can't cut/convert a roll of tape correctly. Or someone was hammered at the die cutter that day, either way, this is getting real annoying considering the typical high-cost of these products.  As measured with a caliper, roll measured .3795 inches on top, which is close enough to what was ordered, HOWEVER the bottom measured .5155 inches with a roll that goes from correct width, to nearly 75% above the correct size. WTF? Can we please learn to cut correctly and stop pawning off your B-stock to Amazon and wasting our time? This one is a first, but not the first time I've seen garbage come out of Tapecase converting 3M stock on Amazon.	-1
Have RK5100k-RK5102k Not if Rockeell improved it Doesn t deserve a star Use only 1 min and hve to tighten blade Get another brand	-1
Work OK for a year then craped out.  The manufacturer never replied to emails.	-1
The springs inside do not retract to their original position. If you insert a #20 AWG wire for example. Then that hole will feel loose if you insert a smaller guage wire. I personally need a more secure fit for my projects. These are ok for cheap projects.	-1
Thermocouple screw is only on one side so you will need to put one in upside down unless you get an opposite one in the pack. I got 1 right and 4 lefts.	-1
Bad quality filament. Low flow index, high melting temperature for PLA. I 3dprint a lot from different filaments - Hatchbox, Fry's, Pushplastic PLAs, some ABS sometimes, tried to print important part of my project, it came very low substandard quality, with massive layers separations and flow irregularities. Also red color is not vibrant, much worse than Hatchbox PLA, that I cannot find no more on Amazon, insted of this they sell now some strange salmon color PLA. Best PLAs we found to date are Hatchbox (225 degrees extruder, 60 bed), and Fry's (237 extruder, 65 bed) on Aqua-net double layer hairspray covered bed, made of aluminium (we extensively use Robo3d printers, beds quickly destroying, so we use aluminium covers for them). So I return this spool back.	-1
Filament cracks and broke several times in my Bowden tube.  I can't leave the spool on in between prints or it will break off in the heat break as well.	-1
I have to return my filament because it's so brittle and keeps on breaking during printing	-1
Filament diameter is hit or miss at 1.75mm, I have a few 3d printers and tried this filament in all of them, it needs at least 245 deg to ooze out and even then, it will eventually clog and start the extruder gear slip -- meaning the diameter if the filament isn't actually 1.75mm throughout.	-1
Terrible filament. Breaks about every 1/2 to 1 meter spoiling prints. I've used about a third of the spool and rarely am able to complete a successful print due to filament breaking. I've had generally good success with Hatchbox filaments but am now concerned about purchasing the Hatchbox brand in the future..	-1
Quality of Solutech filament now varies greatly from order to order/spool to spool/color to color that it is no longer worth my paying a premium price.	-1
Worst filament we've ever used. Very sensitive to hot-end and bed temperatures. At first I thought I was having problems with my 3D printer but after hours of troubleshooting I realized this filament was the problem. Switched to a different color Solutech filament and problems began again...... filament not sticking (w/wo purple glue) no matter what temp our bed was set to. No matter the nozzle settings. Final prints looked horrible. Switched to our proffered filament and all immediately went back to normal	-1
Very flimsy.  Lots of noise too.	-1
THIS  is NOT a REAL K-type compliant connector.  It is NOT made of Alumel and Chromel which are the metals used in a K-type thermocouple wire.  A REAL connector IS made of CH and AL.  Typically, the plugs have AL and CH stamped on the exposed portion of the blades.  The jacks will say CH and AL also.  On jacks it is printed on the yellow plastic somewhere along with a + and a - for polarity.  AL is MAGNETIC, CH is NOT. If  both of your connector's metal parts ARE magnetic OR both are NOT, THAT is another way to tell your connector is NOT a REAL K connector.  If you use this you absolutely WILL introduce error into your readings because the junctions created by attaching the connectors to the wires and plug will turn this into a thermocouple as well since you will have alumel connected to a DIFFERENT metal, and chromel connected to a DIFFERENT metal... whatever metal IT is.!!!  Real cute in the ad. They CALL it a K-type yet DON'T tell you it isn't made of the correct metals and therefore NOT compliant!  NEVER, EVER, EVER buy this if you want accurate readings from a actual thermocouple.  EXAMPLES:  Scenario A:  T-couple made of Chromel and Alumel connected to Fake Plug which is connected to measuring equipment.  In this configuration, The TC,  as well as the connections IN the PLUG are also t-couple junctions.  The connection IN THE jack is where it SHOULD be.  Scenario B:  T-couple made of Chromel and Alumel connected to Fake Plug which is connected to a Fake Jack which is connected to K-type wire again (extension) which is connected to another Fake Plug which is connected to  measuring equipment.  In this configuration which uses a extension cable, The TC, the connections IN the PLUG AND again IN the jack of the first plug/jack set AND IN the second plug are ALL t-couple junctions!  Heating or cooling any of them WILL change your reading!  IF they all were REAL plugs and jacks, the ONLY places affected by temperature would be the t-couple weld (Sensor) and the JACK of the test equipment and NOTHING else.  Cute how they conveniently omit this fact and still call them K-type no?	-1
The dimensions given in the product description are false, plain and simple. The outer diameter, including sheath, is 1.6mm. The conductor diameter is 0.3mm, which means it's 28AWG wire. If you're working with some project that requires VERY light current, fine. Anything more, I wouldn't dream of using it myself. I bought it connect the hotend on a 3D printer and this lightweight wire is completely useless for that.	-1
It was very difficult to remove it from the bed, and then it left a residue that was resistant to everything.  Impervious to alcohol, softened some by saturating it with acetone but still wouldn't scrape off.  Stuff costs about the same per sheet as a new build plate for my printer, so I trashed the old one and replaced it.  I will say that the residue left a nice tacky surface for holding a glass plate in place.	-1
The filament has inconsistent material properties. I've purchased well over 10 rolls of just black esun ABS and kept finding a small change in the print quality. I kept blaming my printer thinking something was loose or out of tune. Then I started saving the last bit of filament to test between filament changes and sure enough, between rolls using the same model, bed location, printer and sliced g code the print significantly changed between rolls that were delivered just two days apart. Attached are two square test cubes both printed with the same file, on the same printer and with black abs esun filament that was delivered two days apart from each other. The bottom cube is from a roll I had been printing with over the past two days. The top cube is from a roll that was delivered today. I had dealt with poor rolls of esun in the past that had moisture content build up over several days when i started using them and since keep all rolls in a separate desiccant filled container. I also print in an enclosed container with a hygrometer to measure moisture. If it wasn't for the fact that I've wasted so much time tuning the printer to a roll, only to tune it again each time a go through the roll I would recommend esun. But the fact it has such a wide range of print quality is of concern. Good thing i didn't order bulk quantity from Esun as I had planned.	-1
I've normally had good luck with eSUN filament, and I'm hoping this was just a bad batch, but this stuff is awful.  I busy so much PLA now, that I don't leave reviews unless it's unusable, and this nearly is.  Horrible bed adhesion, droopy layers, lots of breaks during printing - no matter what temperature I tried.  Not at all what I expect from eSun!  I suspect this may have been a "counterfeit" roll, as it came in a different bag, with no box. but who knows?  If I get too many more like this, eSun will go from my #2 buy for filament to being on my list of brands to avoid.	-1
Let me first say I like Esun filament in the past I bought more than 50kg of Esun filament of different colors and only slight problems that was adjusted out nothing  to really talk about.  Now with that said: The Esun 1.75mm silver ABS that I just received from Amazon  is junk, no matter what I do I can't stop it from layer separation. In the past I had this problem from hatchbox material but not Esun and yes it is ABS but I have used Esun silver over the years with very good success and VERY little layer separation.  I use a enclosed build chamber to run all of my ABS in and the bed temp is 98c with a nozzle temp of 245c these are the settings that I was using when I ran out of my previous spool of Esun silver ABS and changed to the new spool of silver Esun ABS making the same part, and I have not gotten a good part since going to the new Esun silver. I did change to another color of Esun ABS and no problems but I can't use another color on this project. I know its a QC problem but cant afford to keep ordering spools of silver until i get some good spools so I guess I will change to another brand ( but I will buy direct ) so if I have a problem I can get something done	-1
Could not get this cleaning filament to feed through my extruder, no way, no how, at any temp or feed rate. It's a mystery. And was a waste of money.	-1
Warps like crazy, requires a heated bed and is very stringy. Actually very very stringy. Requires high bed temp to lay down. How is this PLA?	-1
Keeps snapping becuase its so brittle. The pink was more like a purple mixed with pink when printed. Will not buy again	-1
I have only been able to get 1 successful print with this.  Tried full range of tool/bed temps.  Parts are so brittle it snaps just handling it.  Prints suffer from blobbing and poot layer adhesion.  Always stored in bags with dessicant.	-1
total trash second one ordered after first was bent and so was the second one. No one will give me money back for 2 purcahsed bent beds and im out 50$	-1
Works, if you don't mind lowest possible quality boards and components. Had to re-solder several poor connections on RAMPS board. Display has contrast issue that doesn't go away varying on-board adjustment. Switch on one end-stop doesn't work and another randomly works or doesn't.	-1
Ive bought multiple spools of 3d solutech and my prior 3 colors have all worked great. This color however, is completely unusable. The plastic strings like crazy, curls furiously and has absolutely no bed adhesion. It will not stick to a glass bed, or itself. Print layers easily peel and separate, most of the time leaving you with a big ball of plastic spaghetti in your nozzle. When feeling the filament, it almost seems like it has a smooth powdery quality to the outside. I suspect the dye is to blame, so do not buy this color!	-1
When they say "all metal"  what they mean is mostly metal with a piece of plastic tube in the middle.  I understand that some people like this type of system, but "all metal" should be all metal from where the filament enters to the end, with a thread at the hot end and a 1.75mm bore at he cold side.  The aluminum heat sink has a large diameter hole on the entry side, which you are supposed to insert the included tube into.  I now have to buy new Aluminum heat sinks.	-1
Didn't use this for a while but just tried it over the weekend and it's dead straight from the packaging.	-1
Not copper. Aluminum is, what's inside... It has a good qtty of aluminum too, but it specifically said copper on the description. For that reason only I'm giving it such poor ratings.	-1
I bought 2 packs of these. I installed one set in a CTC 3D printer. Seemed to work. When I installed the other set in another CTC printer one got red hot. I later checked the wrting on the head. It said 4v/40 watt. Should have been 24v/40 watt. The other one failed. I checked with an Ohm meter and it read about 36 ohms. I guess that one is 12 volt? Anyway I now have to check my first printer and see if it is actually correct. The Ohms should be about 16 for 24v/40 watt. Originally I thought these were great as the ends contacting the core were insulated. I can no longer recommend these and think they are dangerous. Test yours.	-1
I never had a chance to try this actuator. The first one I ordered was inoperative right out of the box. I checked the leads with and ohm meter and it was open circuit, applying power no movement, so I sent it back thinking it was a fluke. The second unit I received did the same, no continuity and did not work. After returning them both I ordered (from a different manufacturer) a more expensive and hopefully functional actuator from Amazon.	-1
I would give them 1 star, but perhaps should give them 3, as I'm not that knowledgeable about bearings, but it says "SEALED" and unlike all other bearings similar to this on router bits etc., the INSIDE is solid sleeve/bushing, w/ ball bearings sealed between layers. This one's ball bearings are exposed, destined to get lodged w/ dirt in most shops, and they fell out when I tried inserting a partially threaded bolt  up to the unthreaded portion.	-1
I have had great luck with uxcell before but these bearings are awful. One of them doesn't even fit on my 6mm rod.	-1
Wayyyy too much grease from China. Not happy I had to clean it all out.	-1
Junk,never get same reading twice	-1
Those are fake DS18B20 sensor sold by "Fun DIY", VDD and GND shorted, heat up to very hot in seconds where it burns your fingers, the label said DS18B20, but it's just a generic NPN transistor, looks like same fake cheap item they sell on Ebay.  Requested for return and refund from Amazon.	-1
I purchased these to replace the bearings in a 3D printer kit I was building as I had read the provided bearings were of low quality. When I got these Sprite Science bearings I noticed two of the bearings had damaged end seals and had leaked some of the balls so right away those could not be used which is quite disappointing since my kit required exactly 12 bearings. Initially these bearings did seem to roll smoother but I have now had to replace all of them because they developed a lot of play and severely impacted performance because of it. I did contact the seller and he refunded me $3 for the two defective bearings but is not interested in assisting any further. I replaced the bearings with the kit provided bearings and while they do not roll as smooth they have way less play and accuracy is really important with a precision device like a 3D printer. I wish now that I hadn't purchased these and just used the provided bearings.	-1
connection to the back is not very good, I probably will have to replace them	-1
Addicore offers no support for these on their forum.	-1
Very thin and cheap.  You get what you pay for.  Not a good buy.	-1
total POS  i use stepper drivers all the time and know how to set them up and use them. this thing worked for a few minutes and then goes into fault every time i send a signal to it. i need something reliable so this POS is going back.	-1
I really wanted to love this product. I saw the reviews here and while mixed, there was enough promise to give it a try. I've tried 4 prints on 2 different machines. One came out okay, the other 3 jammed. My machines are dialed in, I don't get jams.  Found the problem. Most of the filament is between 1.71 mm - 1.75 mm but occasionally it jumps to 1.84 mm. That is going to jam every time.	-1
I bought this on a whim, $12, why not? Well I haven't had 1 successful print with this filament. Changing slice properties to a 1.3mm diameter filament setting helped, but the filament extrudes very thin.	-1
blocked my nozzle very often, switched to hatchbox and esun and you probably won't save money buying this one	-1
It might cut soap or balsawood, but it didn't make a dent in soft pine. I don't think these were tungsten carbide, looked more like streight silver steel.	-1
Good product, POS container. Leaks all over the place even with lid on.	-1
Ends of the spools keep falling off. Ok product	-1
I purchase this filament from B&H. Very poor quality printing. It comes in a cartridge with contacts to communicate with the XYZ 3D printer. The XYZPrinting software automatically set the printing parameter for extruder and bed temperature. I tested it against the MonoPrice natural PLA filament on the same XYZ Pro 3-in-1 printer with matching parameters. The result clearly shows the XYZ nature filament is rougher.	-1
I am specifically reviewing the BLACK Glass(PETG) here. It's really quite bad.  You won't be able to calibrate with this filament because it is of inconsistent diameter. It measures anywhere from 1.68mm to 1.91mm in the 3 foot area I tested it with; most of time it measured on the high side. PETG is finicky stuff as it is and requires you to underextrude ever so slightly. It's not possible to calculate your flow rate with this stuff because it is so inconsistent. So you end up with goobers between your layers and strings all over the place.  When I bought this it had 3.5 stars. I'm reviewing it to save some other people the headache it's caused me. I've uploaded an image of a print I did at .2mm layer height, 250C nozzle temp at 30mm/sec on a 0.4mm nozzle.	-1
2 of 5 were dead on arrival... The ones that worked didn't work well. Despite efforts to tune them they continued to run hot and were much louder than my  A4988s that i was trying to upgrade from. I was using these on a GT2560 board with standard 35mm Nema 17s. Didn't have alot of luck, maybe because they are knock-offs, maybe because im unlucky, buy at your own risk. 2 stars because some of them did work, albeit poorly.	-1
Package was horrible,  I'm shocked that they aren't bent to an unusable point. And the rods aren't polished, don't know how it will affect the bushings (wear wise) and it's over priced for the quilt you get. I'll have to take a caliper to it. But it seems to be off a micron or two.	-1
All four that I got were bowed and useless.  Boxed up and going back.	-1
Junk	-1
I've been using this printer for the past couple months for work. Although we have maker care with extended warranty toll 2017 customer support has been a challenge. To be direct, I have spent alot of time with failed prints. Purchased new extruder, purchased new PC since Dell PC cause crash on software, I only use maker bot parts and filament. I never knew the quality of the reprap but this printer finds value at the $200-450 price range with its poor build quality and reliability. I would not recommend  Printing air is a waste of time and money, thanks maker bot.	-1
Absolute rubbish.  All nozzles were .02 regardless of what as stamped on them.  Internal cavity was full of burrs material would not flow.  It is almost like the seller took handfulls of scrap nozzles and bagged them up for sale to suckers on Amazon.  Worst part is this is not the only vendor doing this.  Best bet is stop wasting your money on nozzles-for-cheap and invest in a good set of MicroSwiss or Genuine E3D nozzles.  Worth the price, especially when you factor in lost time and frustration.	-1
First time purchased of the Solutech filament. I purchased 3 different colors and didn't read this one was only half the size. For the price, this makes it more expensive than hatchbox. The filament is good, but not Hatchbox good.	-1
I thought I was getting at least a good bargain at 14.99 for 1kg as solutech filament is not the best out there, but for half a kg, It's not really worth the cost, but I needed a black asap and it was available. For the quality of solutech filament I have gotten so far, I think 1kg should range 14-16$ and half a kg should be 8-10$, that would make it at least a cheap alternative to better brands at the same cost.	-1
Well this is the second one of these that I bought. The first one worked very well until the wire broke (which was my fault). But, this one. I'm not to happy about. Opened the package and everything looked good so I installed it right away and set my settings in Marlin as from what RepRapchampions.com said. Go to do a PID tune for 240c and the little bit of black epoxy that is on the end looked like it melted and came off. Now I can't even get it to PID tune for 200c. Very dissatisfied this time around.	-1
Extremely brittle and pretty much unusable. Break in tube, breaks loading, breaks in the middle of prints. This was an issue immediately after opening package. Contacted seller but no help.  I am also updating other eSun reviews as the quality I had come to expect from their filaments has completely dropped off.	-1
way to tiny to see anything	-1
First ; I am a long time 3D print user and have 2 machine builds under my belt plus the joy of using PLA when it was first developed.  I am reviewing the product I received and it may/may not have been part of a larger "bad batch"  1. No consistency in filament dia. 2. Had to heat filament to 215c just to attain flow 3. Air pockets in filament	-1
smells really bad, returned	-1
Holds parts well. Unfortunately it easily gets indented and ruined by a hot nozzle, so if you heat your nozzle before autohoming then you will want to adjust your gcode to heat after homing. Once indented this will ruin the base of all your future prints. Also bubbles are created when heated up.	-1
After working with it for well over a month here are the ugly details you'll have to spend money and time fixing..  Firmware requires customization - you'll need to know or learn how to modify the firmware config and reupload. Easy if your a nerd. You'll find that some of your axis directions need to be inverted. There is no way around this, get used to the ardino IDE, you will be using it a bit. The top z-axis plates are initially very snug and you may have to sand, oil the holes that the threaded rods fit into in order to allow them to turn freely. The included spool holder introduces way too much friction/drag on the spool to allow it to turn freely. As a result you'll find yourself baby-sitting your print. GeeeTech refused to answer my questions via email and even ignored my attempt to use their live chat to ask questions. The manufacturer leaving me high and dry forced me to seek answers on my own. What I found made the previous problems seem insignificant.  The above flaws have solutions (well except for bad support) and are easily fixed if your patient - this final flaw should send you running from this printer:  The final flaw is that It is impossible to prevent a jam from occurring - this is a combination of several factors. After a month of dealing with the issue and studying extruder designs I realize that the issue with this printer is that the extruder has a design flaw that makes it almost impossible to keep pressure from building up the extruder assembly. The only solution to this problem is to completely redesign the extruder maybe upgrading it to an E3D-V6 in the process.  For someone like me who isn't very good with machining this design flaw is a huge disappointment. It means that it will be months or years and cost me a couple hundred bucks more before I can use this printer effectively. So while the printer could be a solid 4 star, this final flaw renders it almost worthless to all but the most savvy.	-1
This is edited to change the rating to one star.  After using these I determined that these spire nuts were indeed hard but the screws were too soft to use with the nuts. Later, while trying to remove fasteners from the nuts, I found it nearly impossible to do it without causing all sorts of destruction and damage. The screws just would not back out. Then I looked closer (see the picture attached). These spire nuts are malformed. The thread gripping ears are dead level, not twisted to approximate the spiral of a screw or coarse bolt, and they will dig into the fastener threads and wedge it from reversing. I was expecting a removable system; if I wanted a rivet I would have bought one.  This is just plain junk and should not continue to be foisted off on us paying customers.	-1
Soft metal and screws tend to break and strip	-1
Do not buy! Wasn't vacuum sealed and still wouldn't print after been dried for 8 hrs in the oven. Worst experience I ever had.	-1
Nice bright color but it strings really bad compared to other PETG and its brittle, its so weak it makes PLA look like ABS.  Do not use on any part that requires strength or it will shatter on you.  In heat testing it melted before the PLA did which makes me believe its not even PETG.  Not worth finding a box to return. I'll just round file it if I can't find a use for it soon.  This spool and the last spool of PLA I got of theirs was the straw that broke the camels back. I've had to have so many spools replaced due to brittleness and flow I'm done with them. I have spools so cheap they are in cardboard and cost half the cost that run better.	-1
Meh, instead of this just get a build plate from printinz. Much better. You can even gluestick the build plate and wash it and flex it. This if you wash it, it will un adhere.	-1
I think it's bad?	-1
BIG difference between Electro Static Discharge E.S.D. and Electro Magnetic Pulse!!! Static discharge protection  isn't going to save your precious electronics if god forbid there is ever a true EMP attack. This is just an anti static bag that you get when purchasing a circuit board or mother board. Folks are feeding on your fears. Put your cell phone in a cardboard box and then wrap the box in 3 layers of thick aluminum foil then tape all seams. Then do your cell phone or walkie talkie test!!! Better yet just buy a galvanized garbage can,then line it with something non conductive like cardboard or rubber. Throw all of your electronics inside. Make sure the metal lid makes contact with the entire rim of the can. Seal the lid  to the side of the can all the way around with aluminum tape. Now your ready for Armageddon!	-1
I've used these throats in the past with no problems, but recently all of my prints are jamming.  Turns out that the PTFE liner in the tubes was melting.  This was at 190c.  So, I don't know what happened, but the quality of these has gone way down.  I would look for a better brand.	-1
Okay so honestly I feel bad leaving such a negative review of this product seeing how most people seem to be happy with it, and maybe I was just expecting too much from it but either way here's what I experienced.  The Negatives 1. The filament is very brittle and while they clearly state this in the description it's still annoying. My 3d printer always puts a slight amount of tension on the filament even when you are loading the filament so despite me being cautious I still had the filament break one time, not a big deal if it's removed but if it were to break and you pushed the broken filament into your machine I would imagine it could do some damage. 2. I'm not a fan of the cardboard spool, sure it's eco friendly but it can be damaged in shipping. It also doesn't roll as smoothly on the stand while it's being fed into the machine as a plastic spool does, not a big deal but I feel like if I'm paying a premium price I want something to preform better not worse. 3. The filament lingers around after you change filament colors, while all filaments do this to some extent none of them have been as bad as this filament. I suppose you could just steady run the extruder for a few minutes after you load a different filament but then you're wasting filament which seems kind of pointless. 4. The biggest negative for me of them all is I simply couldn't get a proper print out of this filament. Maybe it was something I did wrong or maybe it was just my cheap 3d printer but every other PLA I have tried has worked fine and I just couldn't get this to print properly. I'll update my review if I am able to get a decent print out of this but that still doesn't change the fact that it's preforms vastly different than a standard PLA.  The Neutral The prints do weight more than a regular PLA filament, I'm not really sure why you would want or need this especially considering the extra weight doesn't add any strength to the print but if you're looking for that this filament has it.  The Positive Despite not being able to get a complete print out of this filament the part I did get looked pretty cool, it has almost like a stone/concrete look to it and if you put some peroxide and salt on it you do get the cool rust affect that everyone likes.  So after all those negatives and aggravation the only really benefit you get from this filament is it looks kind of cool, even with that though it's not that cool looking when you compare it to something like a wood filament. When you use a wood filament and stain your print you can get a 3d print that looks exactly like wood, however with this no matter what you do it still looks like something printed out on a 3d printer. Overall I'm not really happy with this filament even if this printed out fine and I had no problems with it I still don't think I would be impressed by it. It's just not unique or good looking enough to justify the $40 and the difficulty of use was just the icing on the disappointment cake.  Even with the bad experience I will give another one of proto-pasta's filaments a try in the future but I'll be looking for one that is easier to use.	-1
Half the bearings are rough and unusable. No amount of lube helps. These came packaged the same way as another set of bearings from a different seller which had the same problems. I'm assuming they come from the same low quality factory overseas.	-1
Poor quality	-1
I didn't expect much but this still managed to be a disappointment. The chip gets extremely hot very quickly after applying power. Despite the heat, it doesn't put out very much sound.	-1
I've gone through a handful of RAMPS 1.4 boards. They aren't a very thoroughly designed thing and so parts tend to fail pretty regularly. This particular board, however, it just awful. I understand the supplier is probably hand soldering these together in large batches every day, but the quality of work and parts used on this are simply the worst I've seen. The screw terminals were crooked and not seated properly to the PCB. One of the screw terminal outlets had a bent inner flap and didn't work right at all until I bent it back into place with a screwdriver. The caps just behind the power input were haphazardly soldered in with so much of the legs of the components showing that they shorted out against one another. The MOSFETS were similarly badly soldered and came all crooked and smashed down on top of one another on the board. The female pin headers for the stepper drivers for the E1 and E2 positions were crooked and required some adjustment to accept the driver properly.  With all that said, the board seems to function properly. Since this is my 7-8th RAMPS I've owned, I knew what it was all SUPPOSED to look like. And since I'm handy with a soldering iron it was easy to redo it correctly. But if this had been my first board or even my first entry into 3D printers, this would have been a problem.	-1
stopped working after 9 months. the pump failed, junk!	-1
These are not great for pools since the range is only whole increments  6, 7, 8.	-1
I bought the Simple Metal directly from Printrbot about 3 years ago and since then dealt with an extremely temperamental printer without much success.  Regardless of the upgrades, the Cura settings, or changing over to Repetier,  and other physical adjustments (also known as shimming the bed to cope with the the terribly leveled bed that this printer came with) , this printer continued to harass me until the last two days when it decided that it isn't going to home the Z-axis and move in the upward direction each time I issued a home axes command.  At the time I bought this printer, I was considerably new to 3D printing and to add to the misstep of having bought this printer in the first place, I made another mistake of upgrading to a heated bed extension. My confidence until recently was not very high until it was restored back in March.  As usual, my Printrbot was idle for a few weeks, and when I powered it up to print, it refused to home and when it finally did, it decided that it's going to deliver bad prints! This is when I was compelled to go out and buy the "less expensive" and super awesome Mononprice Mini!  So, I printed the very same pieces of work that I had issues with on the Printrbot , on the Monoprice Mini and the results from the out of the box printer were staggering in under 1 hour of time taken to unbox and perform basic bed levelling! This was enough to convince me that it wasn't my design skills or software settings that were at the root of my 3D printing woes.  To be fair, I have updated my review on the Monoprice Mini elsewhere on Amazon and have reported what I do not like on that Printer as well. Regardless, I'm using "less expensive" and not "cheap", because the Monoprice Mini even in its most basic form doesn't deserve to be branded as "cheap"!  My last attempt to work with the Printrbot was fairly successful after I switched to the Repetier host, and configured the Cura Slicer plugin with near-identical settings from the Mini. The results were definitely better, but the Printrbot simply cannot compete with the Mini on accuracy especially when it comes to small parts. This was a minor shortcoming that would've been excusable, but like I mentioned above, the bot decided to hang up its shoes after the Z-axis failed to home following a printing binge of 5+ hours. I have applied all the changes suggested in the Printrbot and reddit forums, but the for the love of life, the bot refuses to co-operate.  If the main board is the issue, then I don't think it's wise of me to make a third mistake of going for a new one!  ------------------------------------- Lessons learned: ------------------------------------  Out of the box, the bed is terribly leveled! Relying on default Raft settings or the auto-leveling feature is not the way to go!  Upgrading to a heated bed is not a fix for the "stick" problems - if the bed is out of level, the print will get off the bed and warp! Despite physically shimming the bed after going for a heated bed, my prints continue to come off on one corner and warp!!! This issue is rampant with pieces that have rounded corners.  Raft in it's default state is pretty much a welded layer - One good lesson I learned from the Monoprice Mini: The factory settings for this printer define the "Air Gap Layer 0" value for the Raft as 0.22mm. On any other software, this setting is 0 by default. Changing the Air gap setting to something above 0.1 makes peeling off the Raft a lot easier on the Printrbot. If not, you may have to employ various mechanical implements to disassociate the print from the Raft!  PRINTRBOT HELPDESK - Don't be surprised if your tickets are abandoned without explanation!  My last interaction with their support team has been dismal. After 2 threads, my ticket was abandoned without rhyme or reason. Literally stating that they abandoned their customer, did not get any reaction.  So, if you have such an experience, don't be surprised. Maybe they just aren't interested in supporting customers who own their older and less expensive printers.  -------------------------------------------------- Conclusion - I have abandoned the BOT! -------------------------------------------------- I have decided to put this printer back on the shelf and go for another Monoprice Mini or one of it's more advanced siblings with larger print capacity. Maybe one day, I will gut it and use the parts to build a printer of my own, or rebuild the guts of this printer with an alternate hardware-firmware product. Three years has been enough to make me not like the printer.	-1
As of 2018 Inland has declined in quality. Before 2018 all my rolls were amazing, bought from both Amazon and Microcenter. Now, buying from both Microcenter in-store and Amazon the rolls just aren't what they use to be. I'm no longer a lover of Inland. This makes me so sad. Now it will cost me more to get quality prints.	-1
Beware the formula change - previously printed fine, but now I've had to raise my nozzle and bed temperatures to get it to stick to the kapton tape.  On PEI it's a little better - but the new formula just refuses to behave.  Packaging on the box is the same for both - but the old formula came in a vacuum bag without a ziplock, and had a solid filament spool.  The new formula has a ziplock bag and uses a honeycomb structure in the center of the spool.  I had to raise my bed temperatures to 85C to get it to stick to PEI.  And nozzle temps past 230 are necessary to extrude it.  Other reviewers have tried 245.  Half a kilo down the drain with failed prints left and right.	-1

this isn't orange.  it's peach!..  otherwise it's a meh filament	-1
The color they are showing in the listing is NOT the orange you will receive. Inland recently changed their colors and the orange you get is actually very light pastel orange. It's an unacceptable color swap in my opinion.  They are advertising a dark orange and shipping something that isn't even close.  It printed fine, however the color is pastel orange.	-1
I ordered a roll of the grey Inland PLA but got what seems to be a house branded filament marked "silvre" as the colour with no marking that indicates that it came from Inland. I have bought inland filaments from other distributors and always got the filament in an Inland box. This spool that I got also looks different from my other Inland spools. I started looking through the comments a while ago and I am wondering if you got this same filament and that's why you're having problems printing with it?	-1

Nice color. Horrible quality filament.  I tried three of their colors.  Purple,black and white.  I first tried the black filament. It works great and has that familiar slick plastic feeling like other brands.  *Kept the filament*  I then tried the white filament.  It was brittle and hard to guide through the extruder pipe.  The prints were horrible. *Sent it back*  So then I tired the purple filament because the color looks like a Nintendo SNES button.  Beautiful color tainted by brittleness like the white color.  *Sent it back*  I'm done with Inland unless they fix their formula.	-1
Seems like half the people who get a roll of this stuff say it is great and the other half say it is terrible.  I guess i got the terrible roll. Won't stick to anything including itself even at 245c.	-1
This spool holder broke immediately after it arrived. Poor chineese design, thin walls metal, hollow hand wrenches, inserts are fixed with cheap stamping instead of proper welding, inclined inserts which prevent proper aligning. I don't recommend to buy it, if you're not a professional welder to fix it all the time.	-1
Spools don't spin not even the hatchbox ones and causes the extruder to run dry. It warps with 2 or more spools on it.	-1
Bad spool design? The filament is too close to the edge of the spool and comes off the edge of the spool way too easily. I had to retry 5 times to get the model successfully printed. I have a 3d printing business and I have used close to 100 spools of Hatchbox filament and around 10 spools of eSun. This is the first time I've run into this problem. This is so far my worst experience with any filament.	-1
A beautiful color but tends to break easily if left out in open air.	-1
This stuff is not very good. It will work with a TON of time invested but getting very good quality is difficult if not impossible. Part of this is just the difficulties inherent with wood filament but I've found this to be very stringy, frequently jams, and is just generally messy. Be prepared to mess with a great deal of settings - temp of hot end and bed certainly matter a lot but you'll have to play with retraction, layer height, speed, flow rate, and other such settings (those were the main ones that I needed to mess with). Even with settings dialed in you will have a good deal of trouble with smaller details. Printing on a home-built corexy reprap with an authentic E3Dv6. My best settings were extruding between 195 and 210C with a bed around 50-60C (to that point, I had almost very few issues with bed adhesion, heated borosilicate with painter's tape) printing about 40-50mm/s. Retraction had to be set pretty high - 2-3mm depending on temp and flow. I used a 0.6mm nozzle and layer heights between 0.4mm and 0.58mm for best results. Even then - this is not a filament you walk away from. Even on successful prints it would jam occasionally - never terribly, a gentle nudge would resume flow - but unless I'm forgetting something I had no print longer than 20-30 minutes not experience this. Was running through a dust filler but happened without it, did several cold pulls as well to ensure hot end was clear.  compared to other wood filaments I've tried this one is on the lower end - price is good, quality is mediocre (you CAN get a decent print from it if you work at it unlike some brands that are just worthless). For the price you're better off with Hatchbox IMO - their wood filament is pretty great and comparable to laywoo for a price not much more than this stuff	-1
Well, I ran it with the Carbon filter for probably 4 months 24/7, recently I took off the Carbon filter and am just using it to exhaust hot air. I HAVE OWNED THIS FOR 5 MONTHS AND IT HAS ALREADY STARTED TO DEVELOP THE DEATH RATTLE, for now the rattling noise is very faint but I assume it to be the bearings going out as it comes and goes... hopefully I can get it to last at least another 4 or 5 months, what a waste of money.	-1
Was way too big for the cr10-s so dontvwast your time orm$$$	-1
The filter itself is well made but it definitely does not fit a 12.5 gallon Shop-Vac ..... without a bunch of effort.	-1
Tolerances are horrible and it'll jam up pretty good in most printers. Used on a Robo3d (with E3D v6 head), Custom RepRap (with E3D v5 head) and a MakerMini.. all jammed. Don't have any of these issues with some other filaments. Skip this vendor, you have been warned.	-1
I bought a pile of MeltInk filament all at the same time when I bought my 3d printer. I have had nothing but issues. I finally bought some Inland filament and it worked beautifully the first print. Would not recommend.	-1

Purchased this brand of filament just to test it out and see if I could find another brand since Amazon was out of stock on Hatchbox black PLA.  The filament is packaged nicely in a brown box and vacuum sealed with desiccant.  I printed out the standard Benchy on my Monoprice Maker Select V2 at .1 quality and with a Micro Swiss All Metal Hotend at 210 degrees which I switched up mid print to 200 then to 190 to look for a printing difference. The print quality of this filament is just plain bad compared to other brands I have used. The color of the black is rather faint, not really black - even a bit of grayish color to it actually. I tried 3 other brands, Hatchbox, Inland and 3D Solutech, with the same printer and same settings and get much better results from the other three brands. Even with Inland, which I consider an economy brand, Inland prints worked much better than MeltInk's.	-1

Most of the time my printer will just not extrude this filament, and on the off chance it does, it is way under extruded. I tried a variety of different extrusion rates, temperatures, etc and I could not nail this one down. I really hope it is just a miss in QC, because MeltInk has very kindly decided to send me a roll of a new filament. If it doesn't work either, I don't know that I would pick up this brand again.  For the positives, the little bit that I was able to get running looked amazing. A very bright safety orange.	-1
filament seems very soft. have been having trouble with it getting chewed up by the extruder gear.	-1

When it prints its nice but its so ridiculously inconsistent that it keeps jamming my printer... its driving me nuts so chances are I won't even get half way though the spool...	-1
Bad its real bad lol	-1
This would be really nice filament if it weren't for the fact that it is so far out of spec. The color is nice and the winding is decent but it goes so far out of spec during a run that it causes the extruder to either slip or jam completely which ruins the print. I'm going to have to return this spool as it is useless to me. I'm running an E3D v6 1.75mm hotend.	-1
First of all, the seller is not from the USA and is sending from China, yet listing this as "PRIME" shipping. I called Amazon, after not receiving it within the week, and found that little bit of information out. This forced me to purchase another one from a confirmed USA seller as I needed to get a part made. The hotend did arrive 27 days after paying for it. It was packaged loose in a dark plastic bag. Installed it on my Monoprice and triple checked everything was installed correctly. Temperature was bouncy going to max then off. I checked firmware and gcode, did a reset and all looked ok. Made a couple small test prints and then went to make a 11 hour print. Was gone for dinner and a movie and came home to a meltdown. I ran to it as soon as I opened the door, I could smell burned plastic and electricity smell. The extruder was a glob of plastic as well as the fan unit. Even the belt will need replacing as it became loose from the heat. I am just glad that my house didn't burn down or it start a fire. I do have a fire extinguisher for that purpose but never thought I was going to need to use it. I would recommend researching your seller and read the reviews before purchasing. I do not recommend buying this hot end or buying anything from this seller that is stating "Prime" shipping and being in China.	-1
Complete and utter garbage It came with a faulty thermistor that caused the unit to overheat and melt the first time I tried to use it. Lesson learned: Don't buy the cheap knockoff print heads like this one.	-1
Packages were marked 'Mechanical End Stop" but were optical end stops. Thanks for delaying my project for several days.	-1
Didnt work	-1
This item listing is obviously broken. I received a 5mm to 8mm coupling. I'm sorry this listing wasted my time while I'm trying to repair my printer.	-1
Nothing stays connected with these boards. What a pain the are.	-1
Not focusable like they claim.	-1
Very cheap. Doesn't crimp well, plastic covers fall right off.	-1
Easy to strip. Heads are soft and rust after short time. Looks as coated, not stainless.	-1
This is not a true 3mm hotend.  It uses 4mm OD/3mm ID tubing and heat break and will not actually run with 3mm filament.  I expected more from RepRapChampions, but I will never trust their hotends again after this one.  I goofed and didn't read the description when I bought it, and when I got it I tested it cold without putting a tip on.  3mm filament will not even get through the heat break.  Do not buy this, look for one with a 6mm OD/4mm ID bowden and true 3mm path.  I returned it the next day.	-1
Unfortunately I bought the 3mm bowden version. Not recommended. Like the other negative reviews, I'd encountered not a total clog, but enough resistance that it will end up shredding the extruder end of the bowden tube. This is quite bad. At first it will be "okay" and extrude a few millimeters just fine. Then when you print, it'll print the skirt fine and then nothing will come out of the nozzle. Then you'll look up and the bowden tube will have committed suicide. (Picture attached of one of many times it shredded itself in the push fittings) I'm not sure if the heatbreak is bad or if the bowden tube is too weak/thin, but it's not really worth repairing/modding.	-1
This hot end is very poorly manufactured. It does not accept 3mm filament without problems. Something in the nozzle throat catches and it cannot reach the heater block.	-1
What I received looked of good quality but was not the right size	-1
the locking clip isn't very well made wouldn't recommend them	-1
I had trouble opening this; it has a metal seal and puncturing/removing it ended up splashing/spilling a bit of it.  Then, it sat unused until I was ready to use it...about 2 weeks later.  I was shocked when I opened it and found less than 1/3 left.  And, NO, the cap was not at all loose on it; I was aware it is highly volatile and tightened it well (and I have very strong hands!).  Now I am wondering if I will have any left when I need it again next week!  That issue makes this an absurdly expensive product...one that I will NOT be replacing!	-1
I am in the camp of this Filament was a pain to work with, no matter what I tried I could not get it to stop stringing. As stated in other reviews Its a high temp filament. Treat it like ABS. Structurally it is very week. I was purchasing this to make corner braces for a new DIY built printer. with a lot of work I have gotten some Ok prints out of it. So purchase this only if you are ready to put a lot of work in to Dial it in. I still have not mastered this filament.	-1
Has too many little issues. Too much gap between the bowden exit and the drive gear. Drive gear really could use to be an MK8 instead. The hardware is inconsistent. Black and silver screws.  Philips and Hex. The bowden links up nicely and releases easily, but on the inside where the filament enters, it has a flat edge that catches the filament on loading.  Further there is another flat edge where the bowden connector ends inside the frame, creating 2 catches on trying to load a filament without removal which I end up having to remove every time.  This is a hassle.	-1
Very chintzy and light weight. Would use temporarily in case of emergency.	-1
I got this, used it for a week then the power supply went out.  Waited for a month to get a replacement.  Then the switch failed.  Waited for another month.  Finally got it to print and realized its a sloppy wobbly pos.  I did get some prints, it needs serious cable management and a better height sensor.  Most of the plastic parts were printed on another printer and are sloppy rouygh and hollow.  First thing to do is reprint your plastic parts.  Then i found its cables were good at grabbing the parts on the table, i printed a cable chain and it solved the issue but i had to extend some wires.  The height adjust needs replacing asap and the belt holder melted the first abs print i made with heated table.  The frame is a joke and is weak.  It wobbles around while it prints and eventually after a few hundred hrs it got so sloppy i went and made a steel frame.  I have successfully printed many parts but the way it comes is a joke.  Eventually the heater failed, the table bearings are cheap and the screw rods came bent.  This has been such a disaster.  At the moment, I cant think of anything else.  The generic steppers and the main board seem legit.	-1
The GOOD. They're well made and tested very good with several different Arduino boards & programs. They worked exactly as they should.  The board has five 10k resistors built in for a cleaner signal (debounce).  The BAD. They don't come with a nut to hold them to a panel. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE 12/4/16  Thanks to a new question & answer above We now know what nuts to get -&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/uxcell-M7x0-75x2mm-Carbon-Steel-Hex-Nuts-Fastener-50pcs-for-Screws-Bolts/dp/B01HGEK0U2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">uxcell M7x0.75x2mm Carbon Steel Hex Nuts Fastener 50pcs for Screws Bolts</a>&nbsp;for only $4.38.

I really wanted to like this brand. Bought one after one of my indicators failed from old age. The first one I bought I was fairly impressed to say the least. As time progressed I was liking it more and more. It steadily has become my favorite 0-1 indicator and still is. So I decided to purchase 2 more at once. This was going to be my standard. Going to purchase a FEW MORE after that too. "No more bland, white-faced, noisy, chinese mass produced indicators for me" says I. I was wrong. Upon receiving the 2 (almost giddy like a little school girl) I opened up the nice plastic cases they come with, picked them up and tested the "super smooth action". These indicators went from Hero-to-Zero. The springs were SUPER WEAK on BOTH OF THEM. They wouldn't even return to zero. WHAT THE- gotta return these. Shameful. Pitiful. Why?! sorry Anytime Tools, they make good 1-2-3 blocks though. Looks like i'll be going back to buying bland,noisy ubiquitous indicators and save up for the real deal. Mit's.	-1
Air voids throughout the middle of the filament some even can be seen on the surface of the filament.	-1
This board is fine and a good value with the following important caveats:  1. If you use with a 24VDC power supply and 24VDC heated bed you are probably OK because the current draw will be reasonable.  2. If you have a 12VDC power supply and 12VDC heated bed you will eventually burn-out or melt the DC input terminal on the control board because it is not robust enough and won't accept wire with sufficient gauge for the current draw.  You can fix this by adding an external MOSFET controller .  I bought this one on Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/ARQQ-Heat-Bed-Mosfet-Tube-Hot-Bed-Power-Module-Expansion-for-3D-Printer-Heating-Bed-Accessories/dp/B01MSH8Z08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">ARQQ Heat Bed Mosfet Tube Hot Bed Power Module Expansion for 3D Printer Heating Bed Accessories</a>.  It offloads the heated bed power and accommodates proper 12AWG wire that won't overheat at 12VDC.	-1
Ok	-1
Got this as a replacement for the original board and it is crap. I put the hex file on it and doesn't work. Waste of money.	-1
Hictop has been really helpful in trying to troubleshoot issues but I have had too many problems with these boards.  I am switching to a different brand.  Good company, Just not the most reliable product.	-1
bad bad very bad worse ABS I ever used. it warp bad and has a bad layer separation and its not one printer I used it at but 3, Flashforge creator pro, UP BOX and Pursa i3 attached pictures done by a pursa i3	-1
Jams at every temp I've tried, and my printer has used at least 10 different types with no issues	-1
Very flimsy knob. Very poor quality control. For that price? I pass.	-1
Is a realy small and very cheap material on this RCAs connectors	-1
works ok, not a great quality picture	-1
Pins will not hold contact reliably. The contacts are held in.... by the double-sided tape.  Worthless as an actual breadboard unless you secure the jumpers down or use tinned pins.  Works OK for a small soldering holder.	-1
worst experience ever!!!!!	-1
As others have stated, the rubber is almost too stiff to get it in the hole.  Stiff is good for some things going into a hole but not these grommets.	-1
very poor quality and feel. burrs in metal, and sticks along slide.	-1
I bought one of these not long after they came out.  Beautiful thing to behold, worst thing to use.  Proprietary software with no real control, never got it to print a single thing.  It kept making a bizarre pattern on the print bed but it never got to the actual print I was trying to get done.  Exceptionally slow printing, from what I saw of it.  Very disappointing.  I ordered the "clear" version, and the light that shines on the front emblem always shined in my eyes.  Everything looked very fragile, which, I suppose, goes with the small size.  It was the proprietary software that you had to use that put the last nail in the coffin.  I sent it back, with some difficulty, and they took quite a chunk out of the return because of one excuse or another.  It wasn't my fault they didn't provide all the details, such as proprietary, and a fee for returning the printer when you weren't happy with it. I still think it looks very cool, but I won't deal with these guys again.  If you insist on buying one, ask them first if they are still using proprietary software or if they have allowed more common software (Slic3r, Simplify3D, Cura, etc) to be used.	-1
Not a fan. I would check other brands.	-1
Very poor quality. I have issues with getting the bowden tube to line up with nozzle throat. Filament catches and will not pass, causing the filament to grind. Glad to see this is no longer available. I only wish I would have tested it sooner and not left it sitting around for over a year. I would have tried to return it.	-1
Ordered 2. They don't match. Fans different size. Thermistors do not match 3950 curve. I had to calibrate it. The high end is not very accurate. The metal throat does not align in one of the heat exchangers. One exchanger has a stop which does not allow PTFE to go to the heat break point. Each came with different size nozzle. Only 1 prints . that one gets stuck too. I have been studying them for 2 weeks measuring temperatures and pressures in 5 places. They simply have never worked. Sorry Sammi that I doubted you.	-1
I tried 2 of them on my SEEMECNC ROSTOCK MAX V2 printer (which works fine with stock hot end) and it continually jams immediately with same PLA filament I was already using with good results. I went to the SEEMECNC forum and I am told these are junk and a waste of time and money. Without have success after 2 trys I have to agree, it does not work.	-1
This is a pretty low grade filament.  The width varies a lot from the specified 1.75mm.  Also, the filament likes to break if you leave it sitting in your extruder between prints.  The very slight constant pressure at the bends causes it to break.  I only give it 2 stars instead of 1 because when you get it to print, it works ok for me.  As long as it doesn't cause your extruder to jam due to the width variance anyway.	-1
I actually had to create a unique PLA setting just for this filament, because my standard setting did not work. I have to print slower, with a higher bed temperature (75C). My first layer is at 220C and then drops to 200C. I had to set ooze controls and alter my normal retractions settings. I finally got a decent print, but wasted a bit of filament to do so. I also needed to be more carful with support. Warpage and bed adhesion faults are common. I print on Glass and hairspray is an absolute must. Now I can print this as needed, and it does look nice, but at the higher cost for a small spool, doesn't make for a desirable product. More of a waste of time to have to fight with settings for a PLA. Not worth it, when I can spend half the money for twice the amount of filament from other venders. I would not recommend this product, just based on the cost alone, but add the frustrations of working with it, makes it even more of an issue.	-1
it did not polish to anything that approached looking metallic ... its a silver aluminum color, that's about it.  Into the Junk draw it went.	-1
First two were fine.  Third one printed a bit but was bad about stopping.  The last two were bored so small you couldn't push a piece of 1.75 filament through them.  I gave it two stars cause 2 of the 5 worked.  The others got thrown away.	-1
It prints nice but is as close to being red as the moon is to being green cheese. It's pink. If I wanted pink I would have purchased pink. This company will never get any of my business again.	-1
Looks red on teh roll but upon printing, it comes out more orange than anything else. I've adjused my setings and tried to get a thicker stream of filament going into each layer but it still makes my parts come out orange.	-1
This material is a bit of a letdown.  I love eSun filaments and print spools a week of ABS.  However the ABS+ doesn't extrude consistently and has a much lower surface quality.  It is however VERY strong and is a lot cleaner printing that Nylon.  I would definitely use it for something I needed a bit of extra strength where a perfect surface didn't matter.  But don't look to replace your beautiful ABS prints with it, its just not up for the job.	-1
This scanner is worthless. I cannot think of one practical application given its awful resolution and scanning quality.	-1
Do some research first if you're thinking about buying this printer. The first one I had worked for 4 days before the extrusion motor stopped working. The replacement stopped powering on after a month of use. The poor quality of these printers combined with horrible customer service from M3D make me regret purchasing this printer. Judging by the amount of complaints against M3D at the Better Business Bureau bbb.org, it appears I'm not the only one who feels this way.  This printer is guaranteed to break on you at some point and will require you to contact M3D. M3D customer support is impossible to contact and generally useless once you do get a reply. They will give you the runaround and ask you to perform pointless troubleshooting on the printer while taking 2-3 days to respond to any messages you might send. After troubleshooting via email inevitably fails, they will ask you to submit an RMA request. Their RMA process is a joke. They will charge you to send in your defective printer and initially promise to send a replacement within 2 days of receiving your defective printer. I've filed two RMAs with M3D and after constant follow-up on my end, the first replacement took 23 days to ship and the second replacement took 29 days to ship.  There are way better printers with much better customer support available for the same price as the M3D Micro. I would recommend staying far, far away from M3D.	-1

This is, by far, the worst filament I have ever purchased!  Brittle and stringy... parts are so brittle that they usually can't even be removed from the print-bed without breaking into pieces.  I have tried many prints with this, many settings and print speeds but it always yields useless prints.  There are many good PETG brands out there, but this isn't one of them.	-1
On my first run, it clogged my nozzles on the Flashforge Creator. I thought it was my printer so I cleaned and replaced with brand new nozzles and extruder gears. After cleaning and replacing the parts, i ran my black ABS and white PLA from another manufacturer, perfect. Then I swapped it to this silver PLA and clogged immediately! When I replace materials, I load the current filament to push the remainder out, then unload. EVERY TIME. This method has always kept my nozzles clog free.  This silver breaks easily and clogs almost immediately upon a start of a print. Once it clogs, i have to remove the fan and open up the extruder housing to remove the broken/clogged chunk of silver. I never got a single print out of this roll! Waste of money.	-1
This stuff is terrible. Using a Robo 3D R1 Plus, I tried my standard PLA print settings that I've used with no issues in the past, which are 220 extrusion temp and 50 heated bed and it spit it out like chewed up bubble gum, if it came out at all. Had just got done printing with ABS at 235 extrusion temp and 80 heated bed so I figured I'd give that a try. Worked good for a couple seconds, but because it's so much hotter than it should be, there are strings everywhere, loss of details, and the supports and rafts are near impossible to remove without damaging the prints. Majority of the print process looked nice and smooth but the last three layers ended up bubbling up really bad so the whole print was ruined. I dropped the temperature to 230 extrusion and 70 heated bed but it resulted in clog after clog after clog. Just threw away 2/3 of a spool and cracked open some Hatchbox silver PLA and so far, it's printing 1000 times better with no clogs and it doesn't look like thick taffy stuck everywhere. Never again using this brand. Have had much success with Hatchbox up to this point and it seems to be continuing that trend with their silver PLA.	-1
The power leads heat up to about 110F (43C) when the heater is operating at 60C (heating a 2mm aluminum plate of equal size).  The wire gauge is very thin for a 18A (220W at 12V) application The rubber mat did not include any adhesive, so I had to buy some 3M adhesive sheets from another seller.  I'll be replacing this with a safer solution ASAP.	-1
Don't be fooled by the preview pictures. This is NOT a metallic filament. It is brown, plain and simple. That being said, it prints extremely well. This would easily be a five start review for quality alone, but they are vastly misrepresenting the color and type of PLA. I would return it, but I'll find some other use for it. Sadly, this was purchased for a client's print which I do not have time to order a proper metallic PLA for.	-1
Printed fine at 225 per the manufacturer's recommendation, but it has zero metallic look, just a dull brown. Not a bad earthy dull brown, mind you, but the word "metallic" is in the product name, and it's just not true. I've used many other filaments with much more metallic effect, so I have a point of reference.	-1
This did not have the correct holes for my Wanhao Duplicator i3 V2.1 so I had to return it. It looked solidly built however.	-1
Visibly flexes while cutting, showing just how cheap the metal is. I've tapped hundreds of holes before this, and had previously only broken a single tap. From this set the M3 broke in the first hole, M4 in the third hole, and M5 in the sixth hole. All in 6061 aluminum.  Most people seem to be having decent results with these, so they can be made to work. Just go REALLY easy, use tapping fluid, and bail out the second you feel the slightest resistance.  But really, is it worth it? Are you saving enough money by buying bargain bin taps to risk ruining your workpiece?	-1
The metal bar is paper thin the plastic endstops are inadequate. No bearings obviously so some drag this holder will walk around where it wants to eventually the spool falls when the endstop works out mid print.	-1
Product was not vacuum bagged as in the description, and usually there is a clear tape disk sealing the box, which was cut through making me think this was a return from a prior customer..	-1
I am unhappy now.  I had one break.  The plastic clip.  I was setting it up and is was using it for empty water bottles.  It broke.  Cheap	-1
I don't see how people are using this, to be honest. It's WAY too brittle! I have a Dremel 3D20 and I can't even get it to feed without breaking off.  I attempted to start a print, but it wouldn't stick to my print bed (using new Dremel sheet). It's probably a good thing it didn't start, because it broke about 20 seconds in.  I tried 2 spools and got the same results with each (so brittle it just keeps breaking). I wanted to like this stuff, but I just can't get it stop breaking.	-1
I have wasted so much of this roll trying to get feeds and speeds right, but so far no luck. I have read every forum post and article about working with this filament and tried every suggestion.  * I have tried it on a .6mm nozzle as well as a .4mm hardened nozzle. * I purchased an all-metal hotend setup. * I purchased a better extruder with more teeth. * I have purchased so many upgrades just to print with this filament, and no matter what I try, I *always* get a clogged nozzle. I have spent over $100 in upgrades to my i3 just to try to print this stuff to no avail.  I can print a few layers and then it clogs. Every single time. I don't know if I just got a bad batch with too much carbon fiber in it, but this stuff does not flow well at all. Too hot and I get heat-creep resulting in a clogged nozzle. Any cooler and it won't extrude at all.  I have had to buy nylon filament just to do cold pulls because of this filament clogging. I had to replace a nozzle because of this filament clogging.  I have filament from Hatchbox, AIO Robotics, eSun, 3D Solutech, Filabot, Sainsmart, and Foxsmart and this Proto-pasta carbon fiber filament is the only filament I have ever experienced clogs with.	-1
Unfortunately I was not impressed. To start with, they give you one applicator sponge and one mixing cup - that's done after the first time you use it. If you want to use this stuff, make sure you buy more of those two things.  Mixing it is easy enough, just like any two part epoxy. Applying it is also basic enough. However, it's far from as good of end quality as is shown in advertisements. It takes a very long time to dry fully. The whole time it is drying, it is slowly seeping so make sure it stays on a surface that you don't mind getting messed up. Once fully dry it still leaves some defects. It cannot be sanded, it gets really weird when sanding. So you can either apply more and wait another 24 hours or just deal with the defects that remain.	-1
Came with a lot of scale or meal or some thick rubbery film from manufacturer that kind of rubs off and gets everywhere. For over $5 for a single rubber cork I'd expect it to be clean and cleanable.	-1
I bought this and installed it on my Flashforge Creator Pro, and have been disappointed.  The print quality was no better than the stock parts, the work required to install this thing was ridiculous, and it ended up not only fouling and jamming more often, but actually managed to extrude outside and through the threads, clogging up the whole right side nozzle and mechanism.  I pulled it out, installed the original PTFE tube and nozzle after a quick soak in acetone, and the printer is running like new again.  Maybe there's something to this thing that's an improvement, but it sure didn't demonstrate it in my book.  Feels like an item that was made to cash in on people's desire to "upgrade" the new and trendy 3d printing world, that doesn't actually do anything other than take your time and money away.  I'm not going to even remove it from the heating block, just not worth the time and hard work to get it it and hammer the bloody thing out.  Spend the $.50 and just get some new nozzles and tubing when the old stuff starts to wear.	-1
Must have gotten a bad batch because this stuff prints terribly. Rough surface finish ,no shiny surface that every other petg filament ive used had and looks more like wood than gold in color. I will not be purchasing hatchbox gold petg until they get their formula right..there are several other brands of filament that have some really nice gold tones that print beautifully.	-1
Received in a bag and no box. I was okay with that, but it did not appear to be sealed (vacuum packed). A nice color of yellow, but not "translucent". I was also very hard to print, and took hours to get things right with temps and speeds. Usually I do not have to worry about adjusting speeds when switching between different PLA filaments, but I had to slow this one down big time on the first layer. After that I was good. Anyone having sticking issues reduce that first layer speed on this filament.  If you play with this filament long enough you can probably get it to work, but not sure it was worth the hassle. I will probably stick with the Inland at my local store. It prints better and costs less (Although colors are not that vibrant). I still have a "translucent" red to try of the WYZworks. Lets hope it does a little better.	-1
Cheap junk. Right out of the package one broke inside my printer extruder causing the bit to lodge inside the tube and now I get to pay $100 for a new extruder. Do not buy	-1
These are not real good for use on a 3d printer nozzle since they break easy and they are not near long enough to use on a Diamond hotend. I would not recommend these.	-1
Just on putting on the rod the ball bearing fell out when the cap came off the second one when I removed the rod to make and ajustment the ball bearings spilled out with the cap on! Very disappointed and waste of my time ad money.	-1
Mine caught fire	-1
This product is horrible. The only thing these rods need to be is smooth, the right dimensions and especially straight. This fit everything except it wasn't straight so I cant use it. Please do not buy this product.	-1
Verrrrry slow shipping. Not worth waiting for. I could have machined my own 10 times by now.	-1
Arrived with kinks and crimped areas.  Cheap tubing no better than you'd get from a big box store.	-1
This filament was a terrible experience for me.  I received a broken spool (the box wasn't damaged), and while most of the damage was on one of the spool flanges, this meant I couldn't use my roller-bearing spool holder, which cradles spools by their flanges on roller bearings.  Ok, I thought, so the spool flange is cracked, but the filament looked ok, so I dug out my home-made spool holder, set up my printer, and started a print.  I use a raft in all of my prints:  thick first layer, one middle layer, and two top layers.  No sooner had the printer completed the middle layer of the raft when I heard my home-made spool holder make a noise from behind the printer.  The filament was tangled, had bound up, and snapped my poor DIY spool holder as my printer's extruder motor yanked at the spool.  Yes, I know that filament tangles don't happen at the factory, but at the hands of consumers by not ensuring the filament never unravels.  I had maintained tension on the filament as I loaded it into my printer.  Furthermore, I still have some old spools of PLA from my early 3D printing days in which I let the filament unravel, but I was easily able to rewind a few turns of filament and the problem was resolved.  The filament seemed very haphazardly wound on the spool, and about 1/3 of the way unwinding it in an attempt to rewind it, multiple strands of filament had bound up, preventing further unwinding.  I couldn't believe it.  I've bought several different brands of PLA and PETG over the years, and I've never had problems with a new spool of filament like this.  I contacted Amazon, sent the spool back and got my money back.  Did I just get that one bad spool out of a thousand or more?  Maybe.  But I will not be buying this brand of filament again nor will I recommend it to anyone.	-1
ZERO METAL AT ALL. DO NOT BUY THIS. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT.	-1
I've printed over 65KM of ABS and TPU filament successfully but I was not able to get this filament to print successfully.	-1
Harder to work with and inferior surface finish compared to Hatchbox and Sainsmart TPU.	-1
This stuff is great if you don't mind having an off center hole and it being .2 to .3mm too wide of an OD.  Had to return it because it couldn't be used at all.	-1
More than half are threaded crooked. The t nut ends up at an angle on the screw - they only touch one side of the extrusion channel. Look elsewhere I have found t-nuts that fit at a proper 90	-1
Very poor quality, about 20% nuts are bad.	-1
I've had this printer a while now. It's never impressed me. It has a great build volume, but the prints it makes are just ok.  I've had consistent problems with the frame going out of square which leads to carriage jams. It came that way. It also came with bubbly PEI.  EDIT: This morning: Thermal Error E1. Awesome. I hate this printer.	-1
I bought this and I never use it because it doesn't have an edge to it.  I could put an edge on it if I had the proper tools but it just sits next to my 3d printer as I use a paint spatula + a razor blade knife instead.	-1
Product package was already open before me. Damaged package. Also they are uselesss for 3d printing since they do not have straight edge. They all have round edge. Do not wate your money for this one for 3d printing.	-1
Great quality but the head clogs much easier than the OEM head causing the printer to "air write". Not worth the price for the headaches; even with the higher allowable printing temperature.	-1
The description states that it fits the FLIR CM174, it doesn't.  I returned it.	-1
Nozzle sheared when attempting to swap with original E3D nozzel during a acetone cleaning. Resulted in damage to complete E3D hotend and heatbreak. Worst purchase for my original Prusa MK2S.	-1
There's are not .4mm, they are more like .2mm.  I was fine with the nozzle hanging much lower (about 5mm) than my OEM nozzle but the prints all had gaps in them.  I then went back to read the bad reviews on this site and people also said the nozzle output was much smaller.  It was a waste of money and a waste of time, I have sense bought nozzles from another vendor that work perfect.  I have pictures to show you the difference.  My printer is a Monoprice Miniselect V2  In the first picture the right is with the bad nozzle the finished product on the right is with my OEM nozzle	-1
set it up, plugged it in, and nothing. Returned next day. Dead on arrival.	-1
I been using eSUN filament for some time but this roll of filament changed my mind about eSUN. While I was printing a large item about half way I started hear a clicking sound coming from the printer like I had a nozzle jam and the printer could not feed the filament. When I got to the printer I seen it was print but nothing coming out, as I started to look what the problem was I noticed a large blob that could not enter the printers extruder. The measurement of the filament is 1.75mm but the blob was 2.8mm. Will never trust eSUN filament.	-1
Terrible , never seen this before.	-1
This sensor with the LM7805 does not work reliably.  Sometimes your A-net V1.0 board will not detect the switch "closing", and your nozzle will be driven into your heatbed.  Sometimes it doesn't "open", which causes Skynet to get a false positive when it makes it's second probe, and you get spaghetti printed in the air.  This bogus combo is supposed to use the 12V output from the sensor to power a 5V V-reg.  Unfortunately, the output of the sensor goes through a 10K Ohm resistor, which provides nowhere near enough current to the regulator input.  Also, the regulator is not designed to pull the output down to ground when "off".  You will never get 5V or 0V reliably from this setup.	-1
DEFECTIVE! have it powered with 12v on the blue/brown -/+. i put a metal object in front of it, LED lights up. However under no circumstance do I get ANY voltage or mA's coming off the black output wire or at the regulator. I DEMAND A REFUND!!!!!!!!!	-1
Have yet to get it to work properly. It doesn't even come close when calibrating, so I decided to purchase a BlueLabs truncheon. No calibration needed with that product. Goodbye Apera ec meter. I have an Apera ph meter that works well, just not good for the ec meter.	-1
Do yourself a favor - buy the version without the 3D scanner at half the price.  The 3D scanner in this machine is unusable.  I purchased it to reproduce some small items I had previously had cast.  I had the original dull-ivory "bucks," perfect for scanning, right? Wrong. The scan preview looked like a livable model was produced, but the actual scan produced... nothing.  Hmm. Several tries, in different positions, with the room lights off, with re-checking the calibration. Still nothing. The support I got said the objects were "too small."  That made no sense to me. I had some PVC pieces on hand, simple shapes and much bigger. SImilar result. With much difficulty, the 3-in-1 system got returned and the non-scanner version ordered.	-1
Seems to jam a lot. I got the Aero add-on to try to fix it, and it helped, but now I'm jammed again. (Seller is a good company, though)	-1
bag had a hole in it and was unusable. popping. hissing, nasty mess. tried drying for almost 12 hours but no change in quality. extremely disappointed.	-1
Company sent a replacement of my first order very fast after request, but the problem turned out to be that ALL their throats are the same garbage and in fact not polished inside at all. Looks like they polished it outside for some reason, and also attempted polishing inside too, as they are indeed slightly better than generic Chinese $0.25 ones. However this is not bore polished, I think what they did is bought cheap chinese garbage ones and tried to electroplate them. Which is not a proper way of polishing, and the result is bumps covered with a new layer of metal. Same bumps, same bad surface. Can't give this anything over 1 star, sorry. Wasted my time with this and $8 or whatever it was. Didn't bother returning a second set.	-1
Pic shows it all. My PTFE based heatbreak worked decent but I wanted to do higher temperatures so I switched over to this all metal one. It fit fine in my e3d hotend but it under extrudes like crazy. Currently using a 0.4mm nozzle, PLA at 190C, and only 1.5mm of retraction due to the bowden tube.	-1
One of the two in this package was not "all metal", it had a ptfe liner. Support did not respond to my query about this.  Both do fit my system, but...	-1
This did not have the correct holes for my Wanhao Duplicator i3 V2.1 so I had to return it. It looked solidly built however.	-1
The inner shim is too small, when you tighten these they bind. The roller angle doesn't match the v-groove either. These will probably work ok if you don't tighten them properly.	-1
There is nothing special here. It is a blunt cake icing knife. It won't get under the print unless I use a razor blade to first lift an edge. It would be better if the tip were sharpened.	-1
Not is single part on this "V6" extruder worked as advertised except perhaps the fan. That should give you the idea. If you really need a 'all metal' don't go cheap. Good source of entertainment for your kids or dogs though.	-1
Poor quality LED. You can see each color LED in the package when turned on.	-1
Two of the nozzles "exploded" during use. The holes widen to around 2mm, making them unusable.  Would not recommend.	-1
4 of 10 motors purchased arrived with bad bearings and 1 with a bent shaft. Two housings required minor machining before an original or replacement bearing would properly seat. Housing from motor with bent shaft was swapped with another that would have required machining to eliminate extra wave washers installed at factory. Two of the functional motors operate at full steps but have issues (didn't explore) that prevent them from accurately positioning and holding during microstepping.	-1
This is product has been good every so often.  I will print a few items and then it will randomly jam due to the filament consistancy being off. That tells me that they are charging full price on a product that has no quality control.   If this is an issue to you, avoid like the plague.  If it is not and you are willing to give it a try, go for it.  Not all the prints were terrible and some of the quality was decent, but I cannot deal with how inconsistant it was.  I will not be buying again sadly.	-1
These aren't as good as there old ones. They were padded and lasted longer. I get maybe 5 prints out of these before I have to trash they pad. Really frustrating.	-1
A little too small for the flash forge build surface, but the real issue was with the stickiness. They usually stay on for about one bed heating before they start to come off around the edges or in the middle. I have tried applying additional glue from a glue stick with no luck. Its almost as if this piece actively resists sticking to the bed in any way after a few prints. I even tried tape all around the sides, but it eventually bubbles up in the middle, leading to an uneven build surface and aborted prints. Hope to find something better quality out there. Ive tried ensuring a clean surface, ensuring a flat lay, and even clamping the newly sticky surface to the bed for a few days before use. Nothing gets these things to last which becomes incredibly frustrating.	-1
Don't tighten down on the these too much. The bearings are cheap and the middle spacer is too small. I over tightened one and it has a rough feel now. As it turns it's like a rotary dial. These would be great if they had better bearings.	-1
Just can not get a good print with this stuff no matter what settings I use. I will not buy again.	-1
used for my cr-10. First two I tried failed prints. Switched to a different brand.	-1
