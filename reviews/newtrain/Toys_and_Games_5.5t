It's a nice twist. I expected it to be thicker and larger. The quality is more less. As a reference, I had a Rubik"s Twist while a child. It was just superior quality, about 1.5" thick, color combination of beige with brown. I have searched for the similar one for about 5 last years with no results. This one came with the colors as at the picture, didn't fall apart after 2 days of use as the other ones, but not very comfi to use. My child play with it time to time. The colors aren't combined well to my opinion. The thickness is less than 1". The movement is a bit tricky. Very overage product, again, comparing to my reference.	1
My 7 and 9 year old's love this toy. It allows creativity and is not difficult to use. It's not a "puzzle" to solve, but just something to play with and create different shapes. Kept my 7 year old busy on a sick day from school for a couple hours actually. He bought it with his own money, he wanted one so badly, and says he was very glad he did.	1
Excellent	1
My grandparents had one of these when I was little, though it wasn't multi-colored like in the picture.  Once I found out what it was through perusing, I was surprised to find it was a Rubik toy, and so I ordered one to replace my nostalgic entertainment.  It's just as I remembered, though mine came in white and blue. It's very easy to manipulate, and provides hours of fun.  It's not a puzzle by any means, but you can use this to gauge your creativity.	1
Good cover up	1
very good thks	1
nice	1
i use this for my daughter not just for painting, but also when she plays on her sensory table outdoors. This prevents her from getting wet and catching a chill when playing with water outdoors.  It is very lightweight and easy to clean, also dries fast - just wipe with a wet cloth, or wash it and hang it to dry.	1
Good item, as pictured.  Received accurately.	1
Hours of fun and many shapes.	1
I bought this for my little sister, I am a big cuber, and This is a high quality snake, although the shengshou is better, this one can last longer. No complaints.	1
I have had this Rubiks Twist for a few years now and it has held together very well and has been a lot of fun for people to play with.	1
Lots of fun stuff you can make with this Tubik's Twist, snake, ball, phone etc. Kids have lots of fun.	1
these are great for when my kids do messy art projects.  would recommend	1
Works well for my 2 yr old who loves to paint. I wish it covered or had small straps on the side though. It occasionally gets in her way.	1
cute bright and it does the job	1
This saves all my daughter's shirt and pants!  It's easily cleaned and she even loves it!  She's knows it's art project time when we get the smock out!  :)  Love this!  *update* 8/2016: this is still holding up great and works well, no rips, tears, or frays! Wonderful!! So worth it!!!	1
These plastic aprons are wonderful for the kids to do water play, paint or when using the moveable sand.	1
Will only keep you play for 15' and that was it because there is not that many options.  After that, there is nothing to do.	-1
Great!!!	1
Useful for spec needs	1
if you bet anything that is messy, this is a must, it is very easy to put on and protects their clothes. REally easy to wipe off and clean and folds up nice and small for easy storage! Must have for messy toddlers and arts.	1
This is great, we paint all of the time and this has saved more than a few of my daughters shirts.  Definitely a good purchase if you don't want to ruin any clothes!	1
These smocks are lightweight and do protect the torso well. Would be nice to have better sleeve coverage, but overall cannot complain.	1
This game has been around for ages and nothing has changed other than the different colors, I think I had one that only had two colors on it. My only complaint is that it didn't come with a manual to let you know what the different shapes, you can make with it.  But, you can always look up on-line to find those.  It would have been easier to have a booklet with the pictures, but oh well. Very fast shipping, no damages, excellent product as expected.	1
Rubik's Twist is my son's favorite now (he also has the cube and the pyramid) because he can make countless different shapes with it, which keeps him entertained and challenges his creative abilities. Great quality toy.	1
Two kids, 4 and 6, have used this for days and it hasn't broken. I was a bit worried from other reviews. I did have to stop them from bending, as opposed to twisting, the toy.  I got this for a vacation involving a plane trip because it doesn't have any loose pieces. It fit the bill. I would by it again.	1
The Twist was a great rage several years ago. Also, Rubik's Twist has been around a long time too. It consists of 24 triangular pieces held together with an elastic cord. It is not a puzzle in the true sense but something to construct objects. The pieces can be placed all in line, creating a snake,thus the name Rubik's Snake. It can be twisted to form many other things,thus the name Rubik's Twist. It is made by several companies and the cost and quality varies greatly. Sometimes it is sold with diagrams of several objects to construct. Try to construct a Dog,Bird,Cobra,Goose,Geometric Shapes ,etc. An interesting shape is a Ball as shown here.  The real important thing to consider when obtaining this productis its quality. A review of the other Reviews will show several people have been disappointed by poor quality resulting in it breaking. You can see where they are offered at greatly varying prices. All I can suggest is that if you get the Rubik's version or other higher priced ones;you have a much better chance of being satisfied,than if you opt for one in the $1-$5 range. That said,there's really no way to assess the quality without handling and twisting it. Sort of the same thing as with an authentic Rubik's Cube and cheap knock-offs.  It is a good object and people of all ages will be intrigued to play with it.	1
Love it!	1
Very lightweight and not great coverage. Wouldn't recommend!	-1
Great for when my 15 month old finger paints!	1
They love wearing it all the time.	1
It reminded me of my younger days so I had to get one for my kids. They like it. It's not as exciting as some of the other toys they got for Christmas but they play with it and turn it into different shapes. They keep trying to make the ball. It's a good, somewhat brain-challenging, non noisy old school toy :)	1
I am 41 years old and bought this for myself, yes I did!  I do let my kids play with it, too.  I had one of these when I was a kid, and I wish I had never gotten rid of it.  This version is a bit bigger than the one I had, and it doesn't seem as good quality as the original; however, it's good enough.  Overall, I'm pleased with it.	1
I am giving this to my grandson for a present. I'm sure he will love it, he lplays with rubic cube all the time. This is a different design, but more challenging.	1
these are good i thought they were going to be a little more thicker but they are thin, can be easily cleaned i would recommend not putting them in the washer since they might get snagged or something and rip.	1
This covered my daughters clothes well front and back. Shes been very into painting lately so we needed something and this wasn't very expensive.	1
Keep the paint off of my daughters clothes and super easy to wash off when she is finished. Worth ever penny.	1
I really like toys I can just plain fiddle with. While there are certainly some educational elements and puzzle elements to this toy, I think the thing that is most fun about it is just the Zen of working it back and forth into different configurations.	1
It broke as I was untwisting it from the ball shape in which it arrives. It was literally out of the package for less than a minute. Nothing like the quality of the original.	-1
I have really enjoyed this Rubik's Twist but I did get the multiple colored one and would have preferred just two colors.	1
I had the original Rubik's snake back in the 80's, so I was excited to find this for my kids as I haven't seen it on store shelves in a long time.  I purchased two of them for Christmas.  It says the colors vary in the item description - both of mine had the exact same color pattern.  There are multiple colored stickers on it.  I have found it is not quite as durable as the 80's version of Rubik's snake.  When you twist things, it stays in position very nicely, but the twisting motion often feels like if you put too much pressure on it, it might break.  Likewise, if you don't twist it the way it wants to be twisted (my nephew tried to just bend it in half!) it really doesn't seem like it will hold up well.  This might just be my bad memory - but it feels just a hair smaller overall than the original 80's version, but it does have exactly the same amount of pieces as the original (you can still make the ball, a dog, etc.).  My original came with a book of shapes to try to mimic - I was disappointed that this one didn't have that.  That added a lot to the challenge - there is no way to "win" with this, so having a challenge to try to accomplish is a good thing imo.  That is easily fixed using numerous websites.  My favorite one is: [...]  as it gives a nice set of pictures of both easy and hard shapes to make with it.  This is a great distraction for my 5 and 8 year old kids while waiting for food at restaurants - small enough to fit in my wife's purse for carrying around.  I recommend it if you are a fan of the original.	1
Good toy. Like the old ones from the 80s. Good deal  for the price. Fun twisting. Item feels sturdy and should hold up with two boys	1
This is an easy and fun product from rubiks. This is an official Rubik's twist, but that doesn't mean that its quality is fantastic. Its not horrible, but it could be much better. Some pieces click sturdily into place, while others almost spin freely, causing some difficulty.  The "stickers" on it are decent quality, have some jagged edges tho. My twist came in the multicolor option, and i do know that some buyers have gotten a blue/white pattern on theirs. Its random which you receive.  OVERALL. If you want a rubiks twist and are adding to a collection, or just find that they are a lot of fun, go ahead and get this. Its not the BEST quality, but i don't think there is anything else on AMAZON that is much better.  Despite the negative points above, its still fun. 4 out of 5!	1
I have purchased four of these so far.  Three were for my own kids. The kids love them.  The quality doesn't seem to be as nice as the old ones but they are still fun and make great gifts. My nephew loves his too.  I definitely recommend this as a gift!	1
Can't be creative without these smocks. Very easy to clean and great at protecting the children's clothing. Their mom loves them too!	1
My kids love to paint and these things have covered them perfectly, kept their clothes clean, and have withstood all the movements a 2.5 year old and 4 year old bring.	1
its cute and for the price you really cant beat it but I wish it had sleeves and provided a little more coverage	1
Works great but I don't think it will last long.  Covers completely.  I would buy again because it covers so much.	1
I guess that I should have assumed this would look cheap and flimsy, just because of the price, but I didn't, and that's what it is. You'd be better off purchasing one of those large bibs with sleeves if it's for a toddler, so I think that's what I'll do. Also, an adult's old t-shirt would make a great thing to throw over a kid's clothes for painting and provide more coverage. This thing is sleeveless, and just not worth the money.	-1
Nice size and fit well.  Large for a toddler but covers all the clothes.  I would purchase this item again.	1
We purchased art smocks along with a bird feeder painting kit.  They were plenty big for 5 and 6 year-olds--fully covered their clothes down to mid-thigh.  And the girls thought they were so cute wearing them!	1
My grandson got this last night for his Christmas gift.  HE WAS THRILLED.  He couldn't wait to open it and get painting..	1
A smock is essential for my son (3yrs) to have for his painting. This one is well priced. My only complaint is I wish it had sleeves, even chapped ones would help. The material is very thin. Wipes up fairly well but some of the "washable" paints have not come off of it.	1
She (my granddaughter) does not like to get her clothes dirty or spotted (girly-girl) so she uses the smock to prevent spots.  She really likes it and it makes her feel special (grown up) to have the smock to put on while she is painting.	1
Two year old turned loose with copious qualities of finger paint. Smock worked fabulously. That which the smock did not catch washed off with hot'ish water from hose lying in the sun. Hot summer days are my favorite of all. Add grandson - heaven.	1
We all know that little ones can make a mess while creating their artwork and when that happens the Art Smock comes in handy. I am so glad I purchase this and it will be purchasing more in the future.	1
Used this product with the washable fingerpaints and the giant fingerpaint paper.  The price is very reasonable so I recommend buying it.  The paint washes off but still saves time on clean up.  I bought this for my two year and it fits with room to grow.	1
Why tie straps know?  Better to play without arms simple art I bought the gown, There is a string that connects the front and back. Defective product, take nothing of me is wondering whether or not.	-1
Great smock, prevents clothes from getting wet/dirty. Cute colors, good fit and easy to clean up. I would recommend it .	1
My little man looked adorable in this and refused to paint without it. It is easy to clean and actually keeps the paint off of his clothes.	1
We like this smock because its very easy to clean and our toddler can take it on and off herself easily.  Good buy for school/daycare or home projects.	1
Why would you use this picture for your advertisement? Despite wearing the smock, the child still got paint on her clothes. How does that help sell your product?	-1
This is a nice, light-weight smock. It easily pulls over the head. It is made of a thin, but durable material. It is a great size for my 2 year old, going down to her waist.	1
We have even used these art smocks as a bib with messy foods and they work great!! It says you must hand wash and we were initially dismayed by this BUT it is easy to get stuff out of these by rinsing in the sink, so no problem	1
My grandson loves painting and playing with crayons and markers and this is very good on keeping his clothes clean!	1
This smock is light weight and yet protective. it's perfect for my toddler when we are paininting. I highly recommend it (especially for the price).	1
Just like the male version, this was a lot of fun for the girls. Was pleased to find a girl version.	1
Bought for a joke.	1
Just like I remember from childhood. Hope the g-baby likes it as well.	1
memory lane	1
Pleased	1
This was a gift for my granddaughter so I have not seen it yet as I had it directly shipped to her.  Looks adorable and they had no complaints.	1
It delivers what it promises: keeps your kid clean and makes them feel like they are real artists.  Now just try to keep your house clean.	1
I purchased this smock for our grandson for Christmas along with art supplies and was very disappointed in the quality for a Crayola product.  Our grandson is 4 and not a big for year old and the smock was way to short and wide it also fits awkwardly, not a good design or well made product.  Get the Melisa and Doug smock it is more expensive but one that will last.	-1
Bought this along with Crayola Giant fingerpaint and paper  for my 4 year old nephew for his birthday.  This fit him nicely and he managed not to get any paint on his shirt.  He did manage to get some on his pants but that's because he is 4 and he likes wiping his hands on his pants.  I would recommend getting one of these if you plan buying the fingerpaint.  Made clean up much easier.	1
just how I remembered these things :)	1
Too tricky to create a hair design for a child or adult.	-1
was not aware of how small this size  was...not the company fault tho...we did use them for the grandkids	1
This retro toy was a hit, specially with the adults!	1
If you liked wooly willy this is a great alternative.  i never knew it existed till i saw it on amazon.  nice quality and makes a nice "non electronic" toy for kids,  no batteries, doesnt take up space and i don't think you could break it if you tried.  a fun tradtional toy	1
i got this for my son. he is just getting into coloring and i thought this would be a good idea to help keep some of it off of him . its nice it just slips over his head and covers his front and back. not complicated at all.	1
cheap enough-cute, lightweight and  fits a 2 yr. old well enough to last at least 6 mos or more...quality above average.	1
Big and waterproof. Ties nicely under the arms and around the neck. Works very nicely. HH HH HH HH HH	1
Standard art smock and it works well. Still fits my daughter who is big for her age and is 5.	1
Gift for granddaughter	1
came super quickly nice size and super fun to play with.	1
Well contained, magnet hair fun!	1
First the positive: This game is very fun. It is somewhat educational in that you match color pieces for each player to their spots and must have some memory skills. It is cute and the music the bus plays is easy to understand and is not annoying. It is a great idea for a game. Second the less than positive facts: There really is no place to push the bus on the board very easily. We play it on the floor and push it around the board on the floor. Second, the little button on top is tempting to kids and thus we have listened to countless 'wheels on the bus' songs. Overall: If you look for games for your young child that are educational, this is probably a game to skip. However, if you look for toys and games that are fun and easy to play this is a good game. Even my two year old daughter was able to play this game with very little prompting. There is another game similar to this but without the music called Penguin Pat. It is a bit more educational (counting and color matching.) We really like Penguin Pat at our house. If I had to pick one of the two, I'd pick Penguin Pat. You might consider looking at that game before buying this one. But Penguin Pat is a bit harder and my two year old has a harder time playing it. I would most likely buy this game again and would probably buy it for other kids as a present. It is a cute game. Enjoy.	1
My son is very messy and this art smock works perfect to keep him clean.  Very easy to wipe paint off of as well.	1
This smock works... but for a small amount of more money I couldve gotten something better and that would cover arms. This goes over the head, ties behind the neck, and under both arms. A child can NOT put this on themselves at all. It's more like an oversized bib than a paint smock. But, we are making it work until a new is bought.	-1
We got this smock several years ago for our then one year old. It lasted until this summer (and done a pretty decent job of keeping the paint off the clothes!). The kiddo was painting away, decided she was done, and tried to take it off herself. Snap! The straps broke very easily.  In conclusion - great for young toddlers.	1
Can't believe I bought this piece of junk! Worthless purchase!	-1
What's not to love? Work with kids, have it in my office, a big favorite!	1
Fun retro toy for my grandbaby	1
Excellent..!	1
Old fashioned fun. Excellent value.	1
My soon to be 5& 6 year old did not care for this as you have to have it laying flat in order to play with it.	-1
Fun.	1
Classic toy resurrected.  Gave it for a 50th birthday present.	1
It looks just like the picture.	1
great	1
Remember these when I was a kid.	1
My kids have no interest in most toys that I loved from my childhood. And why should they with all the cool stuff out there these days? I bought my kids these as stocking stuffers and they played for hours! They enjoyed showing off their creations and being silly. Worth the price.	1
My 21 month old wears it when painting.  Its big so we tie it pretty tight to fit but it works fine.  It fits bigger kids much better (maybe 3 and older).  My 7yr old wears it too.  It's soft and keeps spills off clothes.  Its not waterproof but it is pretty protective.	1
We use it a lot, and it looks cute, easy to put up, and easy to clean! Love this smock a lot!	1
Bought this for my nephew for Christmas, but we've had one for my son for at least 3 years.  We either take his shirt off or roll up his sleeves & have never ended up with stains.  This does a good job for a 2 year old or a 5 year old.  Still fits & has held up to abuse.  Ties are still intact.	1
I bought this for my grandchild and am so pleased with the purchase. These kids need to be familiar with old school toys and the fun they are. So happy. Nice quality item!	1
Lots of fun when I, as in grandmother, pull out little trinkets from my purse. They never know what, when or where it will happen and it is always fun to watch them enjoy such small treasures. No, I will never be a Toys-R-Us grandmother to clutter their home. Little inexpensive, unusal items are fun and always a surprise for them since it doesn't happen on a regular basis.	1
It is a 9 hour ride from my house to my grandkids.  Hopefully this will help pass the time away.  Love it!!	1
Good smock for small children.  The ties and open sides made it easy to get on and off.  I love the pockets in the front, they make kids less likely to set paint covered brushes down in the house.  Covers the child enough to keep them clean but not so much as to restrict their movement or make them uncomfortable.	1
My two year old daughter loves this tea set.  It is the perfect size for her and she uses it with ease.  It is thick, durable plastic, easy to clean and the tray keeps everything together.  She loves carrying it.  I think one of the things that I like most about it are the color changing tea cups.  My kids seem to really be amazed by that!  I would buy this again and again.  Perfect for a little girl who isn't mature enough for a porcelain set.  UPDATE: Three years later and this tea set looks as good as the day it arrived.  There are no cracks and the painted areas are still intact. I now have three toddler daughters who use it daily.  They enjoy tea parties with everyone, especially daddy!  Wonderful product and highly recommended.	1
Our daughter received this tea set as a Christmas gift - at 20 months. She has loved it and plays with it every day. When our family or friends come over they even joke they are going to be sick on "tea", because she loves to pour a cup for anyone who visits. The set is very durable. She drops it, and steps on it, and no problems. The tray with grooves for each item is wonderful because it helps her steady it when she carries it around, plus it helps her pick it up at the end of a tea party. I also love the fact that you can actually put water in this set. There are no holes for it to leak out of, and no electronics to worry about ruining. She loves to carefully prepare a tea party, and then invite her stuffed animals or anyone who will come, and serve them. It really works her imagination. This truly is one of the best toys our daughter has ever had. She loves it, and I would recommend it to anyone.	1
My 4-year-old received a very small, age-inappropriate porcelain tea set as a gift. She really liked it and played with it quite a bit, but it didn't take long for her to break some pieces. She continued to play with it, even after she'd broken some pieces, and it was tiny, almost Barbie-sized, so I was excited when I found this Playskool set.  It's perfect!  Nice, sturdy, washable plastic. And the fact that cold liquids change color in the tea cups is wonderful, too! The set is a very nice size for tea parties and you can actually put liquid in the tea pot and drink from the cups. The tray is perfect for little hands to carry it all, and it has perfect, little insets where everything sits on the tray to keep it all from sliding around. It's got everything, enough for a party of four, cream and sugar, and 2 spoons, too! Perfect! Any little girl would not be disappointed to be serving tea with this set. Very cute and very functional.	1
Cute and affordable tea set.  Plastic so it doesn't break or chip!  Color changing which adds to toddlers creativity and imagination!  Durable which makes you feel good about your purchase in this economy.  My daughter loves it.  She plays with it daily and requires water each time!  It has helped with her verbal skills (we chat during tea time!) and hand eye coordination.	1
This tea set is perfect and adorable. I looked at a bunch of different sets before purchasing this one and I'm so glad I went with something plastic yet durable and the cups changing colors is just awesome. The colder the water the darker the color but it they will change color with just cold water. My 4 year old daughter loves this! Quite happy.	1
Mine was missing the creamer and the company no longer makes them so they couldn't provide a replacement.  Otherwise it is a good product.  The cups change color in my daughters room and it isn't overly hot/cold... not sure what that is about!	-1
Quality and fun! I love having magic tea with my daughter with the same set I had as a child. It's really neat. And Playskool never disappoints!	1
The cups really do change colors.  I was surprised by how well they worked when I got this for my daughter.  The only thing is that you have to make sure the water really is ice cold.  I couldn't get it cold enough out of the tap so had to use water from the fridge, but that was no big deal to me.  My daughter has a lot of fun with this.  I wish it was a little more colorful or prettier but I don't really care.  I know the cups can't have lots of color because they do the changing thing, but I wish the plates or tray had some sort of a pattern or something.  All in all, this toy is great though.	1
Item is great and shipped promptly.	1
This is one of the best baby shower gifts I have ever received so I turned around and bought this for a very dear friend of mine. It is sone special to be able to keep up with how my baby was growing and when she reached different mile stones.	1
i have one of these for all 5 of my kids and just bought this one for #6. there are 2 different sizes available by different vendors on amazon so be sure to check the dimensions if you are trying to match to your existing collection. this is the 'bigger' of the two. i got my first one 8 years ago and use the bottom to track weight and height after 1 year. not perfect, but at least its all in one place! i love that i can easily view each of my kids milestone weight and height at a quick glance. this is a perfect baby gift!	1
I have had people tell me not to buy the Roseart brand because it is very inferior to Crayola.  I did not have this experience.  I bought a bunch of these for my son to use (he also has crayola markers) and they last every bit as long as Crayola does (provided he remembers to put the cap back on after using them.  The colors are pretty much the same too.  Crayola markers are great, but they are so much more expensive.  I feel the quality of the RoseArt and the Crayola are the same so why would I want to pay more?  It is after all - just a marker.	1
Awesome thanks!	1
We bought my 13 y.o. son the tamer version of this game. The questions are fantastic and fascinating, that's true. But the game play stops cold every few seconds as you refer to the directions or read paragraphs aloud (the directions tell you to do so). If I had it to do again, I'd save my money and buy the Zobmondo Would You Rather books - - the questions are the fascinating part of this, not the game, which drags.	-1
Play sometimes when we have people over.	1
This is awesome.  I love the regular Would You Rather...?  And the Sick and Twisted version is exactly that, sick and twisted.  It's an awesome game to play with mature adults.  This is not a child's game or under 18 game!  Grab a few friends and a case of beer (or bottles of wine if you prefer) and get ready to laugh your butts off.  Fun, Fun!!!	1
You really get to know your friends and family playing this one!  This is a great game for some good laughs.  I have bought a few of the versions.  Fun!	1
We thought this game would be fun, so we ordered it for a camping trip with the family.  We had five kids ranging from age 10-22.  So, we thought it would be a good balance for everyone.  Less than half an hour into the game, everyone was ready to quit.  It was very boring, no excitement and didn't really make a lot of sense.  I wouldn't recommend this game.	-1
I bought this game as a present for a friend. It is a fun game. It is better with more people involved 4 or more. This game is properly labeled "twisted, sick and wrong" some of the questions were awkward. We all had fun playing this game.	1
We had a great time with this game. I generally don't enjoy board games but this one held my attention and everyone got laughs out of it. I am glad that I gave it a try. It made spending the evening with my inlaws tolerable. Thanks.	1
I got this for my 11 year old daughter who has trouble (still) with her multiplication facts. So far she has enjoyed listening and testing herself on the toy. It has a volume control button with 3 different levels. It also has a jack to plug in earphones. It has a lightening round where you can see how many facts you can get right in 90 seconds. It has a quiz round, a round to plug in the missing number and a section just to listen. I am hoping this will do the trick. I also bought the addition one for my 3 year old for Christmas and I am glad I did because she likes to listen to this one. The price was nice because I got both for $34.00.	1
IT ARRIVED PROMPTLY IN GREAT CONDITION :0) HAS LASTED MANY YEARS NOW & HAS MADE ITS WAY THROUGH ALL MY CHILDRE (NEICES/NEPHEWS), FRIENDS CHILDREN & EVEN MY DAUGHTER'S CLASS ROOMS, HAS HEALPED MANY OF THEM IMPROVE THEIR MATH SKILLS, WHILE MAKING LEARING FUN.	1
This was given to my daughter in the third grade, and at first she was intimidated by the questions. It starts out challenging you to easy questions, but as they get harder, I can see her try harder too. It gives you several answers to choose from, and praises you when you pick the right one. It gets harder and harder, but kids seem to love it. It's great for long car rides, and isn't very loud and annoying. Has a shut off switch to save battery life. Very fun toy, and extremely educational! I even bought the one that teaches addition for my first grader.	1
I wanted my kids to experience the fun of an old school yo-yo.  I bought first an imperial.  It was good, but they seemed to have a hard time with it.  The butterfly is a little easier to do.  Very good.	1
Solid yo-yo.  Same as I remember from my childhood.	1
As shown, its was a dirty Santa gift so I can rate it as a child's gift.	1
I love Duncan YoYos	1
A yoyo too light is so it is not possible to make many plays.	-1
Duncan is a great product, however, I found them on Walmart for less of what i paid here	-1
works well	1
This is as good as i remember.	1
Duncan rules!	1
Love it!!	1
Picked this up for my youngest son, he's working on his skills.	1
Like bed it	1
Item as described!	1
Great starter yoyo for my 7 year old son. After a few hours he was getting the hang of it.	1
Yo yos are great fun, unless they arrive broken. The string was pinched in the pieces of the yo yo. Due to an assembly problem, I'm guessing.	-1
My grandson loved it.	1
Great product and arrived on time.	1
Its a toy	1
The adults always play with the children's toys at Christmas, so I purchased all the adult children one for Easter!  They are having a blast with the yoyo's.	1
Duncan! You really can't go wrong	1
Item as described. Thank you!	1
This is a good starter YO-YO and at a very reasonable cost. It is made of very good sturdy plastic. It has a fixed steel axle,t but it is not a take-apart YO-YO.Being a Butterfly  YO-YO ,it has a wide opening and  that makes it easy for catching on the string. It  does not have a basll bearing,therefore the vbsleep time is quite short. Mine is orange and came in a package much like this one,except also inclouded a CD-Rom trick tutorial. It was manufactured in America and shows a US flag on the right hand bottom of the packageIt shows a Copyrite 2002 and an address for Duncan Toys Co.fixed steel axle. P.O. Box 5 Middlefield,OH 44062..	1
good for price but broke fairly easily	1
Ordered this for my husband as a stocking stuffer and it was perfect! The one that came is blue. Great quality and everything exactly as expected.	1
she loved it	1
very nice toy. will be a nice gift.	1
Why in the WORLD do they sell this, made like this? Duncan is the brand, right? I have purchased two of Duncan's yo-yo's recently, and am disappointed. As a kid, I remember this being the best brand. The string in this is not 'fastened' to the center in the middle. No matter how hard I tried, I cannot re-wind it without a tremendous amount of effort. The string just SPINS when you try to rewind it.	-1
All of the negative reviews are due to people NOT knowing how to USE. A yo-yo. A yo-yo will not just magically go up and down. A yo-yo is not "unbalanced" because it wobbles. I've just read all	1
Parker Brothers sold the Trivial Pursuit rights over to Hasbro and they can't make a board game to save their life!  The board is annoying.  It's very hard to make out the colors, see the squares right, etc.  The questions are next to impossible, even my parents who are over 50 could not answer most of the questions!  My husband who thinks he knows everything, even admitted that this game was just too hard.  We found the questions to be written poorly and often misunderstood by the phrasing.  We decided to try out Trivial Pursuit IV and loved it!  Hasbro just can't cut it!  I'm sorry to say but I beleive this is the end of Trivial Pursuit as we knew it.	-1
Great for back packing, or tossing to bored kids. You know that look kids get after meetings or church or whatever you've subjected them to is over?  They think that it's finally time to go home but then you just talk and talk and talk. In the parking lot. In sight of the car. Throw them a yo-yo.	1
It's a Duncan... Nuff said...	1
I introduced my grandkids to yo-yos! Happy Happy kids!	1
Trivial Pursuit is always awesome, however for this addition, China, and Benjamin Franklin are good guesses if you don't know the answer.v  I've played it once and they were each the answer over 4 times	1
I knew this item was used, but it was listed in "New" condition.  The box edges were quite worn for something that was "New."  That being said, all of the pieces inside the box were there and in good condition.  For the price, I am satisfied with the condition of the product.  I love this game and it is hard to find it anymore at a decent price.	1
On a whim, I bought this Yo-Yo as a Christmas stocking stuffer for my 12 year old. Just a silly toy for the sock. Guess what happened? She plays with this dang Yo-Yo more than the Xbox! Just goes to show you, the classics never go out of style! It was also cool showing her tricks I remembered from 40 years ago. Score!	1
kids love it	1
I received a blue butterfly yoyo great gift and speedy delivery.my grandson is going.to enjoy learning how to do tricks on it	1
Just like it was advertise online, thanks.	1
The grandkids get a kick out of their yo-yos!	1
I recommend you spend a couple bucks more and get the Butterfly XT model.  This model has no bearings, it just slides on the shaft. Of the several yoyo's I bought in this model, some will randomly become completely responsive and others will sleep randomly.  And the main reason I don't like it is that the two halves don't separate! If you get your yoyo knotted up, there's no way out! How do you even get a new string on here!?	-1
No gimmicks, no frills, works well. Still the best all around Yo-Yo toy I remember it as being bigger and heavier but then again i was much smaller............still feels good in my hand, great stress relief.	1
thank you!	1
I REMEMBER THE BUTTERFLY YO YO. IT WAS AS DESCRIBED.  MY GRANDAUGHTER LIKED IT & PRACTICES TO USE THE YOYO.	1
String snapped on the first day I was playing quite aggressively with it, I'm just glad it hit the wall not the window !!!	-1
My son was begging for a yo-yo.  Duncan was the only brand I considered.  He loves it and it takes me back to my own childhood to see him play with this.	1
This is a good starter yo-yo for kids or adults. Don't expect it to be perfect, but it will do the trick for learning how to use yo-yos and is a great value.	1
Great Seller great buy	1
I've been around yoyos for over 40 years.  This one just doesn't work right.  I bought it for my son, cut it down to his size per the instructions on the package.  When he complained that it didn't work I gave it a try.  Yoyos are supposed to go down and up.  This one only goes down and spins.  No matter how hard  you try, it just won't go back up.  I guess if you only want to walk the dog, this might be your yoyo.	-1
YoYo seems out of balance. No matter how much care I used in throwing it, it wanted to tilt to one side. Made it difficult to sleep or do tricks. I have a little experience with YoYos and have not had this problem with others.	-1
Much to old of a toy for my grandsons.  i wouldn't recommend this for anyone younger than 8 yr. old.	-1
This is great for beginners.  This is a wonderful yo-yo that's easy to learn with.  Great for some of the more basic string tricks.	1
After 3 minutes the yo-yo just spins in circles and can't even perform simple sleeps.  It either spins in circles when trying to go down, or stays in sleep for and won't come back up.  Definitely need to get a better quality yo-yo if you want to do anything with it.  At this point I can't even yo-yo without tricks and I haven't even used it for more than 5 minutes.	-1
I would highly recommend either this yoyo or the Duncan Imperial for beginning yoyo-ers.  They're the classic Duncan design that's easy to handle so you can get the feel of yoyoing and a few basic tricks.  A wonderful gift for young kids or adults who remember the joy of a simple toy.  Also a fun gift for yourself!  I keep mine on my desk for when I need a break for a few minutes!	1
I bought this Yo Yo for my 10 year old niece for Christmas and she loved it!  It is a great yo yo for beginners to help teach them how to control thier hand/eye coordination!	1
My daughter (16) received a low quality Yo-Yo as a gift and started to do fairly well with it. It was clear from the start that Yo-Yo was not so well balanced and was not one that she would be able to to use to do a lot of tricks. She bought two Duncan Yo-Yo's, this one, the Butterfly, and the Imperial Yo-yo.  This Yo-Yo made a big difference from the cheaper one she had right away. Even my wife and I were able to do basic tricks with the Duncan Yo-Yos and my daughter is able to do some fairly cool things with it.  This is a great low tech toy (no batteries required) that can still entertain kids. It has "passed the test of time".  Highly Recommended!  CFH	1
this made an excellent gift for a 7th grade boy. Probably would be great as stocking stuffer or party gift Quality met all expectations. Recommended !	1
We bought this for our 16 month old son. He has had it about 4 months and still loves it. It has every thing you could want, shape sorting,put and take, buttons to push, music, phone, peek a boo. Even a clock and gears to turn. We love it, it had the most activities in one toy. We also like it that the Fisher Price shape sorter (yellow can with circle, square and triangle) shapes can also be used with it.  It also makes a great gift.	1
I got this toy when my son was about nine months old- and he instantly loved the music buttons. Now he's 27 months, and still loves the music buttons. The blocks are now lost, and he never figures out some of teh stuff on it, but he run right over every morning and hits a music button!	1
I have a 1 year old and a 2 year old and they both love this box. I have nothing bad to say about it because it truly keeps them busy and it provides them with fun along with educational opportunities. I would highly recommend this.	1
It's the perfect size, and being rubber, it should last a long time.	1
This is a review for the rubber piggy bank. It's cute. Sturdy. But the legs are hollow and eat the change. It's really hard to get the money out of this bank. So frustrating.	-1
This is really a toy for children and adults to enjoy.  Of course there are many parts, which took 10 hours to assemble.  Needless to say, you need a large area, where it can be kept.	1
Really poor quality.  Metal is thing and bends really easily.  Price is really expensive for what is essentially a dollar store product.	-1
Got this for my grandson for a Christmas gift. He still has it and really enjoys it.	1
Good gift	1
My son, age 7, received this toy for Christmas this year. It was rated for ages 10+ and I thought it would be too difficult for him to put together himself. Wrong! Within 2 weeks it was complete with no help from me. I was amazed. He looked forward to working on it a little each day and to watch his excitement grow the closer he got to completion was exciting for me. He learned about reading the manual and following the correct steps as the project progressed. His curiosity became stronger with each turn of the page. When he got the roller coaster to actually run after working and discovering how the gears worked to make it go we were all thrilled. Also, the sound effects that come with this toy surprised me in how realistic they sound. It is a great addition to the project. It was a reward for a job well done. The parts were easy to put together so he didn't get frustrated about something he had already put together coming apart. Our cat goes in and out and in between, bumps it and shakes it and it still stands. It is a durable toy and doesn't take up as much room as I thought based on other reviews I had read. I look forward to the next K-NEX project. We are thinking of the Ferris Wheel next.	1
Came out of its box, and with a crack. Cannot gift this as I had planned to. Very disappointed.	-1
This is just the CUTEST pig ever! I love that it's rubber, meaning it's seems to be made out of the same thing a Baby doll is made from so no worry about breaking it. The head turns and you can remove the scarf but I don't know why you would, LOVE this piggy bank!	1
Kids liked this little safe	1
Im only giving it 4 starts because it didn't come with enough gumballs lol	1
It arrived broken and cannot be returned.	-1
Neat	1
This guy is the cutest little piggy bank. I bought it for my grandson and my daughter loved it. The quality is really good and it is super cute. The size is also a plus, not too small.	1
The knob broke off.  It was so small, we had a good laugh.	-1
Loved it! I even filled it with m&ms	1
I ordered this Bank for my granddaughter as a Xmas gift.  She loved!  Especially because she has a younger sister and now can keep her own things there.	1
Our six year old twins, Six Flags fanatics, begged for this for almost a year before we got it for their birthday.  The mostly non-verbal directions were the best we've used, construction was not difficult at all.  Only a few "mistakes" in the directions, or drawings where the step was not easily understood.  Only missing one small piece, out of 1280, and it was finishable without it.  We built the larger model first, in two evenings. The instructions were not clear that the motor pack (sold separately) is OPTIONAL, and not in the least necessary.  The small battery powered motor does just fine.  My kids actually play more with it with the motor and sound effects off than on.  It is equally fun either way for them.  (I prefer the motor off and the sound effects on!)  It is certainly the most stable construction type toy we have bought for them, and can even be moved around (easily, when complete, and carefully, when under construction.  This isn't true for ANY other constructive type toys we've purchased.) Most others are too wobbly or delicate, this one is very sturdy.  It really is the coolest toy I have ever seen.  We can't wait to build the smaller model, and then get brave and design a few of our own.  I can easily see the purchase of a second set down the road.  Luckily we have a great room with a vaulted ceiling, since I assume greater heights will be necessary to complete a track twice as long!  Don't be daunted by the reviews here claiming it is difficult to build.  It is not nearly as challenging as just getting some of their other toys out of the blasted packaging they come in!  Follow-up, 7 years later.  We paid $100 for this 7 years ago, and our twins built it and took it apart many times over those years.  In the end, it was still their favorite.  They decided to sell it this year to buy some Nerf dart tag guns, and when they listed it for $50, it was sold the next day.  There is apparently a big demand for some of the coolest toys that aren't made anymore, or are hard to find, and quite a bit pricier now.  I think they could have sold it for almost what we originally paid for it.  They have done really well when selling all their K'Nex, ReKonstructors, Lincoln Logs, Tinker Toys, and all their other "construction" toys, so keep that in mind when shopping for your kids!	1
ok	1
Very cheap quality but for the price, it seems pretty fair. the top and bottom pieces don't stay on well.	1
A lot bigger than I thought it was going to be. But very cute! My 1 year old loves moving its head.	1
Super Cute and does a good job holding coins!	1
This is a great bank for kids as it will not bust into pieces if dropped! Very cute face too!	1
My kids have a great time paying for and getting the gumballs out of this!  I do worry, though, because it feels quite cheap.  I think one good drop and it will break.  Three months later, though, and it's still holding up.	1
Great quality product. Accurate description with fast shipping. Well recommended A++	1
very cute gumball machine.  easy to remove top and the bottom comes off often and too easily.  We liked this product, but maybe a little too expensive for the item.	1
Terrible quality; the lock doesn't work - if you just keep turning it to the right it will open.	-1
Easy to open and cute - what more can you want out of a piggy bank. the neck scarf is movable/ removable  and his head moves too!!	1
This little pig is a wonderful toy and bank. My grandson loved it. Delivery was quick and arrived in exelant condition.	1
I had one of these locking cash boxes when I was a kid, thirty+ years ago.  I'm happy to report this is almost the identical box!  I wasn't sure my own children would appreciate them, but they turned out to be a huge hit for all three girls aged 8, 10 and 13.  The girls frequently have lots of birthday and grandparent money laying around which is why I thought of this box.  Great idea for getting them to put their money and valuables some place safe.  The combination dial is just a single number which is great.  A three digit combination probably would have been too challenging for my 8 year old.  The box also comes with a simple key.  Really pleased with this purchase. Good price and a nice value.	1
Great looking piggy bank. Since it is rubber, the kids can play with it without fear of breaking it. Small complaint is that due to shape coins are difficult to get out. I think it is great overall and the kids loved it!	1
Perfect gift for several 6-7-year-old grandkids.  They all have secret stuff that needs to be kept away from their siblings.	1
This thing is a disaster! The lock can barely be turned by an adult, let alone a kid. It's already in the trash on Dec 26. DON'T BUY!	-1
She loves having a secret place for her things	1
Big piggy bank. So very cute. My granddaughter searches the house for change to feed him. And when she decided to donate her savings to hrt school's drive to raise money for cancer therte was no problem with retrieval.	1
my kid loves to play with this.	1
My grandson is going to love this, big fan of gumballs.  I received the item fast and package right.  I wanted to play with it but it's a Christmas present.	1
Alarm is very loud. The lock is extremely hard to turn. My son cannot turn himself. Concept is great.	-1
Cute and sturdy bubblegum machine. Hold a lot more gumballs than I thought (that's a good thing). Only thing I do not like is the Double Bubble brand on the front of the clear plastic gumball holder (gumball tank?) is permanent. I don't need to see the brand name and kind of blew it for using it as a prop in some product photos. I would also say this is more of a toy, as compared to the household bubblegum machines back when I was a kid.	1
We use this in our children's ministry at church - the kids tithe. Such a fin way to teach about tithing. And, this little bank is really cute. He is a good size, easy to get money out, and I love his collar :)	1
Great for model boats!	1
Very easy to use on controlled applications.	1
Great little gift.	1
BEST STUFF I EVER USED. DRYS FAST AND HARD. HAS TENDANCEY OF PLUGGING UP SMALL NOZZEL. KEEP ITS NOZZLE POINTED DOWN WHEN NOT IN USE	1
WHAT a PIG-gy bank!!  My grandchild adores the larger size, friendly smiling face, and movable head.  They "played together" for almost an hour and now Polly has her own bed, too!  Best thing, NOT EASILY BREAKABLE.  Would reorder, have already recommended . . .	1
Great item work's great	1
My Little saver wanted a piggy bank that is a real looking pig! After the first one made of ceramic we purchased met it's maker via tile floor after 1 day of being carried around. This was the perfect choice - It is sturdy and holds a lot of coins. We love to Feed the Pig!!!!! LOL	1
Good Product	1
Grandkids got this with the book Penny Love - great fun for them	1
This adorable and well made piggy bank arrived better than I expected for such a low price. The packaging resembled a wooden barn. The bank itself is sturdy. The little pig's head can rotate. We are so pleased with the bank and are going to order more to keep on hand for birthday gifts for my daughter's friends.	1
Brilliant idea!  It's so crazy how majority of piggy banks are ceramic!  I bought this for my 3 year old daughter but my 18 month old son likes to throw everything so it works out well.	1
loved it. used it to fix kids toys, and they are happy kids as far as i can see!!	1
Love	1
Dries clear and bonds parts faster than window cement. But I'm not telling you to use on windows.	1
Mine arrived clean, & came w a plug so I'm happy! Super cute! Doesn't bother me that the coins fall into the legs. I'm just happy to find such a cute bank that isn't glass for my 4 yr old to play w/. No strong smells from this piggy either (which I am always concerned about due to my sensitivity to chemicals).	1
Love it. Looks very well made	1
My 6-yr old son chose this after his brother broke his original bank.  Super cute, easy to access opening, and huge plus that it is not breakable since he's always handling it.	1
My 3yo loves it. It was hard finding a plastic piggy bank but after he broke a ceramic one I really wanted something safer. He loves emptying it and putting the change back in. I like that the bottom stopper is a little too difficult for him to pull out himself because he can't dump it out wherever he wants to.  Other reviews have said that it's difficult to get coins out of the feet. We have emptied and filled it dozens of times without much of a problem. We just shake it to empty it and that seems to work fine.  This bank is exactly what we were looking for. Since my son basically uses it as a toy I really didn't mind spending a little extra on a safer piggy bank.	1
Great	1
great glue showed up in record time	1
The bottle is a bit clumsy to use, a lot of squeezing and then it finally comes out fast and loose, but it bonds excellently and dries completely clear without fogging the acrylic which is exactly what I wanted.	1
flimsy, and lock never worked	-1
Doesn't bond very well. Let set for 8 hours and it fell apart immediately.	-1
Glue can not come out. I followed the instruction, cut 1mm, nothing come out, another 1mm, again and again. Now already cut half of the injection pin.  Totally blocked.  Now cut more than 1 inch, still nothing out	-1
Works good. Fast drying. Melts parts together permanently.	1
Keep it clean. works well	1
Being an accountant, I usually give Piggy Banks (and starter fund) as a shower gift. This one is perfect as it's rubber and not breakable, with an opening perfect for little hands. You can also "customize" the scarf if you are giving to more than one child in a family.	1
Great gift	1
I miss the old metal nozzles...but far better than the old metal tubes when I was a kid!	1
I bought this for some broken train table parts.  It holds well when dried but I wish it would instantly bond when I am trying to fix the broken items.  I would still buy again.  Oh and the smell is horrible.  It is very strong so watch out if you have wee ones.	1
Glue.	1
super	1
thanx	1
It will open even if you do not know the combination.  Kinda junky.	-1
Great for legos and fixing toys. Which was the only reason I purchased it.	1
It is very hard to find an unbreakable piggy bank in stores. This is cute, durable, but a little bigger than I imagined.  I've read reviews that stated the bottom plug was missing. Sure enough, the plug was not on.  Then I looked around and it was in the box. So do look in the box before complaining. The company should tape that on.	1
Excellent glue.	1
Wouldn't even hold plastic toys together.	-1
my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loves putting money in it.	1
Highly recommended.	1
Wow, I'm shocked to see so many raving reviews.  Perhaps many others haven't discovered a better alternative?  This cement is worthless for model building, and here is why: -Difficult to squeeze: No, I don't need to get a hand exerciser, but when it takes a massive amount of force to squeeze the bottle, you lose dexterity and it becomes harder to put that glue where you want it.  It is also impossible to get less than one big drop, so the small precise tip is useless -The glue dries VERY slowly.  Like, perhaps 30 to 45 seconds for a good contact-stick, and a full minute to hold something in place that has a bit of spring to it (such as a part that doesn't quite fit).  Do you want to hold each part of a 500 part set for a minute? -You have zero control of flow.  Because of how hard it is to squeeze, your options are one big drop or a squirt.  I was using [LOCTITE 1734231 1g Super Glue Liquid Mini Trio, Pack of 3pc, Clear] while I waited for this crap to arrive, and I immediately went back to it.  The Loctite glue has a bigger applicator, but because the tube is easy to squeeze, you can get sub-drop sized amounts.  It also bonds almost instantly, so you can move on to the next part while it really sets.  Did I mention it doesn't smell?  Do yourself a favor, use anything else but this crap.	-1
as expected	1
I gave the safe to my Grandson on his 4th birthday.  He loves it!!  It is well made and easy to use.  It's a nice size, not too big, not too small.  You can keep the default code or change it.  I do recommend and yes I will buy it again, one for each of my 3 other grandkids.	1
Great Detail!  Great Seller!	1
Works great	1
This broke right after my daughter started using it, horrible.	-1
I really like this particular glue because it's more of a liquid rather than a gel like the more typical polystyrene cement in a tube.  There is also a very narrow tip for more precise application. Just make sure any excess glue off the tip and put the cap back on when finished and it should stay clear and flow well.	1
Only complaint is when the product is at a low lever it takes forever to get it to come out.	1
So, it bonds plastic model parts?  Fantastic then.	1
Works as advertised and I would buy again.	1
Good Product	1
This helped my grand son to put together his modal car and learn the skill of managing very small pieces.	1
This is so cute! My 2 year old loves it and it won't break when he drops it!!! Win-win!	1
This is great cement for models. The applicator really helps out and prevents you from having to keep piecing a hole, like the other cheap ones.	1
This worked great for our son's model ships and boats he makes.. Is in high demand from him.. and so glad to have found it.. Super awesome!!!!!!!!	1
Love this little pig. Got for my son after he broke his 2nd piggy bank.  He plays with it all the time too.	1
This is larger than I thought it would be - it is a nice size!  Purchased as a gift for our grandson.  He is so excited to have his own bank and since it isn't ceramic, he can't break it!	1
... not QUITE as good as the Model Masters version, which Testors also makes. This Testors version does have a very slim applicator (you snip the tip off after removing the outer lid), but the Model Masters version of the glue features an even more precise applicator. Still, this is MILES better than the tubes of Testors glue I used as a kid -- believe me, the glue from those had a way of getting all over everything, including (inevitably) the cockpits of the aircraft models I was regularly botching.	1
This thing is huge and the alarm is beyond annoying	-1
I LOVE THIS GLUE. I ALWAYS HAD THE TUBE AND EVEN FOUND ONE FOR $1.00 AT THE DOLLAR STORE. BUT AS SOON AS STARTED TO USED THIS GLUE I FELT IN LOVE WITH IT EVEN BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE EVEN DOUGH I HAVE A BRAND NEW TUBE. THIS GLUE DOESN'T DRY UP AT THE TIP LIKE OTHER GLUE. AS LONG AS YOU CLOSE THE LID IS READY FOR YOU TO USED PLUS THE TIP HELP YOU ADD GLUE TO JUST THAT SPOT WHEN TUBE MESS UP YOUR MODEL IF YOU GET IT ON ESPECIALLY THE WINDSHIELD. ONE OTHER PART I LOVE THE WAY IT SHAPE. NO WAY YOU CAN DROP IT LIKE OTHER GLUE. IT HAS 2 SIZE TO STAND.I BUILT 3 MODEL AND STILL HAVE GLUE LEFT BUT I BOUGHT ANOTHER JUST TO KILL 2 BIRD WITH 1 STONE WHEN I ORDER ANOTHER MODEL.. TRUST ME YOU WONT REGRET THIS GLUE. I GAVE IT 5 STAR *****.	1
My 3 year old is obsessed with gumball machines and he was so excited to receive this as a gift. It works well and all the pieces are still intacted with about a month and a half of daily use. The only issue I have with this is that the cover on the bottom that's holding the coins come off very easily so sometimes when I move the machine the bottom (and all the coins) fall out. I usually keep my hand on the bottom when transferring it to prevent this from happening.	1
Great!	1
OK but I had to cut open the slot more to be able to put silver dolor coins in that I give the grandkids when they come over	1
Very cute and durable . A lot better than ceramic alternatives especially for little kids like mine. Literally unbreakable. But has two major flaws 1: The top hole should have been a little larger. Large coins don't fit in there ( also the pretend ones). 2: Legs would be better without a hallow space inside. Coins get trapped there and make it difficult to empty the bank when needed.  Overall, good quality and cute appearance, if only it was better designed...	1
This is the best piggy bank ever.  We needed a " money pig" for  my grandson.  This bank had to be tough enough to survive a drop or two and the rigorous life of an adventurere.  He has fit the bill.  He is not to big or to small.  His opener at the bottom comes out but so easilly that it is being taken out all the time.  So good job to the makers of this piggy.  Not to heavy or big and yet not to small that he gets lost in the shuffle. He also cleans up well since he took a mud bath last weekend.  So he can be your piggy bank and your piggy friend.	1
This was bought for an 8 year old girl to keep her 3 year old sister out. It works for that, but don't expect any more than that.	1
Wasn't as big as I thought it would be.	1
Our 4 yr-old grandson wanted a "pig" piggy bank, so we got this.  He loves it.  He carried it as we strolled around a New England village and everyone we met stopped and commented on it.  Fun for him, fun to share his fun with others.  The pig is fairly large, made of a great material.  The head swivels which makes for a variety of expressions.	1
super cute	1
Love this item	1
I wouldn't recommend it, poorly made, didn't last.	-1
Not full of gumballs as pictures, but my son still loved it.	1
Very durable for child to carry and cuddle.	1
My granddaughter loves it. Very happy.	1
Fits Canadian nickels perfect	1
I love my piggy. She sits on my desk and takes care of all of my small change.	1
This piggy bank is really cute.  I bought this for my 2 year old daughter and she loves to save money.	1
I bought this for my toddler so he could start saving money. I didn't want a ceramic one that could be broken because he doesn't have high shelves to store it. He has dropped this and pulled it off his shelf many times. No problems!	1
The pig is adorable. Would be better if they made a piggy bank where you can feed money through its mouth.	1
cute little porker!!  And the kids can USE it without fear of damaging it or hurting themselves!	1
It was surprisingly difficult to find a sturdy, non-breakable piggy bank for my 3 year old daughter. She had a ceramic one, kept out of reach on top of her dresser. Naturally, she decided to climb up and get it, and knocked it down and broke it in the process. We got a stuffed animal one at Target to replace it, but the lid at the bottom broke within days, so we were looking for a replacement again. This one is perfect. It fits all her coins with room to spare. It's adorable. It's not too easy to open, but not impossible either. And, most important, it's going to be just about impossible for her to break. She likes having a bank that she can pick up and play with, and I'm happy I won't have to replace this pig any time soon.	1
This broke quickly and easily. Didn't last long at all.	-1
Got this for my 12 year old nephew. He loved it! Heavy, sturdy.	1
Bought these for 19 month old and 3 year old grandsons. They're really adorable, but not too cute, and the boys love their piggies! They use them as toys, so thank goodness they're durable. The bottom plug is twist on, so they don't easily pop off. The point is to keep the money IN the bank, so who really cares that there's a lip that make it a little more difficult to dump it all out at once, that's a really silly complaint. Very happy with the piggies.	1
Great for kids!	1
Plastic dome keeps it from breaking when dropping gum balls inside.	1
Really nice for kids, know my grands will love....it is of decent size.	1
Works great	1
Very nice quality hard plastic piggy bank.  I ordered two fro each of my grandsons, and they love them.  And can't break them!  Nice quality plastic.	1
great piggy bank	1
Soft, rubbery skin. Won't break like a ceramic' bank' if it falls off a dresser. A little larger than I'd prefer. Very cute, especially with the 'country' bandana. The head will swivel some so you can 'pose' it.	1
Great bank for 6 year old.  In previous reviews, I read kids would carry them around & become attached to them.  The first day my Grandson had this bank, he removed the neck scarf & his bank became his pet pig.  Due to reviews, I stuffed the legs with cotton immediately to prevent coins getting stuck.  Other than that, the bank is very durable & well made.	1
Quality metal, works flawlessly, gives each of my kids some peace of mind that the others aren't riffling through their stuff. The bell is loud enough to be heard throughout the house.	1
This is the piggy bank every child should own! I want to buy my other two kids one now! Sturdy, won't break, the plug at bottom is a turn style lock so kids can't easily remove, the head removes if you want to put larger coins such as half dollars in. My daughter has named him Wilbur and sleeps with the little guy. She won't let me recycle the box he came in because even it is adorable. It looks like a barn and a stall for him. Great gift and great purchase!	1
Bought this for my 7 year old son for his birthday from a local toy store. I debated between this one and the other one available by Toysmith. After looking at both at the store I decided on this one because I liked how the numbers looked on the dial better, thought they would be easier for my son to use and I like that inside it has a blue insert since red isn't his favorite color. My son was thrilled to receive it. The one number code works fine and if you lock it with the key it will not open even if you set the dial to the code. I am giving it 4 stars b/c we have only had it a week so I can't comment on the durability yet. Just be prepared if you get one that the most enjoyable thing will be locking up items from siblings, lol.	1
I filled the bank with over $40 in quarters for a guessing game for children at a Fundraiser and the winner was very excited.  The information states that the bank is made of rubber.  It isn't soft like I thought it might be, but very sturdy and perfect for little ones.  Much better choice for a child than a breakable bank. Very pleased with product.	1
very tough rubber piggy bank.  Our little 3 year old won't break this one!	1
Great product	1
If your having problems in opening the safe, it may because the number was wrote wrong on the bottom. Easy to figure out after you get it open.  Now it's a fun safe :)	1
My Daughter loves her piggy bank and I love that she can run around with it and I don't have to worry about it breaking.	1
Bought 2 of these for my lo's. Youngest rides them across floor so they are holding up well to races, shaking, dropping. Stickers don't stick to them which could be a good thing. Plenty of room in them for a child's fortune. Happy with my purchase!	1
nice	1
Fantastic rubber piggy bank! my son loves it!	1
It's a piggy bank. Not a pepper shaker. But, you could probably modify it to be as such.	1
I buy for all the grandchildren	1
So cute! After breaking more than a few ceramic banks, this is the perfect alternative for my little girl.	1
My 4 year old granddaughter loves this Piggy Bank. I don't have to worry about her breaking this one. Especially since she wants to carry it around all the time.	1
Good quality, so beautiful	1
Terrible quality. Door opens right up. My poor 7 year old was so excited about "securing" her belongings but the three year old could open it without doing the lock. This one ended up in the trash after a month.	-1
MY 8 yr old Grandson was very pleased.	1
loved it. Thanks.	1
i got two of this for my boys 3 / 2 years old and they love it, god product. arrived on time	1
Got 4 of these :) Very cute, durable.	1
After trying a real ceramic piggy bank, I realized that I had made a mistake in not realizing that my 3 year old daughter would want to play with the piggy bank. After the ceramic one broke I knew that I needed something sturdy that would be a bank and could be played with. This piggy bank is adorable! So well made. The opening on the stomach stays put and is not super easy to open, that way I'm not worrying about coins spilling when she plays with it. My daughter is a genius in opening things "child-proof" and she has yet to open this.  The head swivels side to side which is a nice little touch. Overall I'm extremely pleased with the price and quality of this piggy bank! Highly recommend.	1
as described  just be sure to buy extra bubble gum as there is only a small provided	1
Bought as a gift for my 1 year granson. Something he can keep for years and save his money in. Arrived on time and in good shape. Very nice piggy bank and seems to be well made and durable. Would recommend for anyone if your in the market for a nice gift or just something for a child to start saving their money in.	1
we got two of these and we do not like them...	-1
giving it 4 stars because it is what you would expect from a $10 machine. The bottom pops off pretty easily. The mechanism works for the coins work. My niece was happy enough with it since it was an add on birthday gift when I got a killer deal on the toy she wanted.	1
So cute! I wish my LO learnt to save money :) (but its too early). Its tough to get the coins stuck in the legs.	1
Perfect	1
This was bought for a gift and it went over very well. I also bought the extra gumballs because what it comes with is just for starters. She loved it as did all the kids at the birthday party. Glad I purchased it.	1
Cute and durable!	1
When this item arrived it did not have the plug that holds the money in.  There was no way the seller could have noticed this as the package was intact and secure.  However, I had a very disappointed 3 year old as the bank is of no value. On the bright side the bank is lovely.	-1
dumb when thr alarm goes off it opens no USE	-1
It lasted about 1/2 day before the knob broke and it wouldn't open anymore.  Just handling it you can feel how cheaply made it is.  Of course it's pretty cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.	-1
grand kids love it	1
Such a cute and durable piggy bank!	1
My son wanted this safe, so we got it, it cute it is made of steel, it does make loud noise, which is good and bad LOL!  My son placed all his money in, which is cute, now it weights more !  it is a big box I guess I did not read the size, but my son is happy, and I am happy with the product	1
It's really cute.  I put a quarter in it and got stuck in the leg, but it's not a big deal.  I read someone else's review and will put cotton in piggy legs.  I love the product.	1
I hadn't bought a piggy bank for my toddler because I feared it would break. So when I found this one I thought it was perfect and it is. You always see kids shaking their piggy banks in excitement and my son can do that without me fearing it could drop & break. It's also just very simple and classic. I gave it 4 stars because my 3 year old can twist the cap on the belly and take out the coins easily but we talk about what a piggy bank is for and we put the coins back.	1
A favorite of my grandaughter for her 7th birthday.	1
The kids love these, but it's a bear to get the coins out. Not only do they get stuck in the legs and snout, but there's a rim around the opening that makes it impossible to stick a finger in and slide a coin out. Pretty much the only solution is to shake the thing until random coins bounce out.  On the plus side, the bank is cute and seems to be indestructable.	1
cute CUTE !!!	1
Purchased for 3 year old. safe durable,high quality and cute!	1
Perfect for a young kids first piggy bank. Only real problem is the coins getting stuck in the leg. We tried putting cotton in there but didn't work as well.	1
7 year old nephew likes being able to lock it with treasures inside.	1
Very disappointed this came with 30 pieces of gum it is like 1 row of gum not really clear on that so went by picture it should have a photo of what it will look like my son did not understand easter bunny giving him empty gumball machine.  also the gum is just a beat up mess see picture there is literally no coating all chipped off	1
Super cute good sized bank, very durable and perfect for my young granddaughter who kept dropping her ceramic piggy banks.  There were copious tears over the shattered banks.  The head turns so you can face it in any direction.  She has already dropped the bank several time and it has survived without even a scratch.  Well constructed and a good value for the price.	1
Our four year old loves this.  He can change the code to whatever he likes, and he changes it often.  It's super easy to use and seems to be built better than one that his brother has.	1
Cute pig, but it's very big. Wish it was smaller.	1
So super cute. There were a few dirt spots as mentioned by other reviewers, but I think that is a product of the rubber and probably can't be avoided. They came off easy. The pig is cute and has a simple aesthetic that I really like.  It is pretty hard to get coins out, but that's not a con for me!	1
Cute as pie	1
100% Excelente	1
Exactly what we were looking for (after TWO piggy banks had crashed to earth).  This is pretty darn cute.  Was actually larger than expected - even though I did look at the measurements.  It is baby pig size, and rather adorable.  Great purchase and my daughter loves it.	1
This is a great piggy bank for my son, who broke his first one.  It looks like a real pig and is a good size to hold quite a bit of money.  Plus it is not fragile.	1
Santa brought this for our 6 year old and she loved it!  We haven't had any issues or problems with the locking mechanism (the alarm sound IS very annoying, but . . .).  It's well constructed and actually a bit heavier than I would have expected.  I think this would make a great gift for a 6-8 year old girl.	1
This guy is great for a toddler. Well made and indestructible. Daughter has thrown this around and it is still in tact. Very cute also. Haven't tried taking any money out yet. Will update when we eventually do.	1
I'd rather get my gumballs out of my dog. It's made of plastic and it's just a piece of garbage. It should never be used for gumballs and never put dimes in it cuz it will just get clogged. You would not be smart to get this. It made me mad and I cried.	-1
This cash box was purchased for my 7 year old grandson.  He loves it. It gives him a sense of responsibility. pride and security in having a place to store his money and no one can get to it but him.	1
First, I have to agree with most other reviews posted already regarding both the incorrect answers and oddball questions. It's as though the creators tried to include only the weirdest situations or the most arcane notions. Hence, the game is reduced largely to guessing multiple choice answers. Because nearly every question and answer is so strange, it's hard to see what can be educational about the game. Still, in my opinion, what really plagues this game is that it is just not that much fun. Basically, you move your game piece across the board a certain number of spaces determined solely by rolling the die. Of course, you have to guess the answer first, and the younger kids are not going to have a clue. (Hmmm, maybe there is a way to play without the questions. . . .) There are no obstacles on the way, and there is not way to send an opponent back home or into a tar pit or into a rattlesnake nest or some sort of worst case scenario that might instill some interest into this game.	-1
Rugged just what 2 boys need. Can't break this one.	1
Bought this for my 2 year old.  It's adorable & the most perfect piggy bank for her!  We love it!	1
The grandson (6.5 yrs old) loves this bank - he especially likes the money I put in it :) No, really, it's a great product - easy to use - easy to change the combination and easy to reset if you forget the combination. Sturdy - even though it's made of plastic.	1
Daughter loves it	1
My 7yo definitely dug this but it's certainly a bit rickety but then again that is part of it's charm.  Even without the code a bit of pressure will open it so be sure not to do this around the kid as I did :).	1
Fun game for our whole family !	1
SO SO CUTE G- DAUGHTER LOVES IT	1
Pretty good. Wish alarm were more retro and less electronic. Not as sturdy as the one I had when I was a kid.	1
This is just a toy safe. My grandchild liked it. One can turn the dial left + right several time and open the safe. It is a good toy to store money.	1
Expensive for what you get my daughter likes it.	1
Thought this sounded fun.  Not much of a game and the questions aren't great.	-1
Humans can breath through their skin?!?!?  Really?  Many of the "correct" answers were like this.  Tossed it and looking for another.	-1
I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this lock box. The combination lock is made of two different pieces (the metal knob and the number plate); almost immediately after opening the metal knob and the number plate began to spin independently of each other, forcing me to figure out which number was the correct number to open the box. The lock is cheap tin, and the keys are also made of cheap tin (the lock is currently busted and the key are bent). I was expecting a higher quality item, but I was sorely mistaken.	-1
Happy with product.	1
cute unbreakable piggy bank	1
Okay granddaughter, try to take a hammer to this one. Smile	1
You get what you pay for.  Cheap piece of junk.  It never worked correctly.	-1
Horrible broke immediately. Returned.	-1
This is the 2nd Schylling Piggy Bank we've purchased, one for each boy.  They love them.  Now because the box the bank is in has the font of the piggy bank exposed and not covered by cardboard, it tends to get a little bit of dust on it during transit.  But I have not had a difficult time removing these smudges with a wet washcloth and mild soap.  It happened to both of the ones I ordered (a year apart even, which leads me to believe common problem).  I know if takes less cardboard to not pack in enclosed one, however perhaps they could cover the front with a cellophane to prevent this.	1
We have broken three ceramic piggy banks, so this was a serendipitous find. I purchased one for each of my granddaughters and made different neck ties for each of them. The banks stay closed when played with and the babies need adult help to open them, which is an added bonus.	1
It's cool.  It's just like the ones when I was a kid.  My eight year old should love it.  The bell thing is annoying, but serves its purpose to keep his little sister's paws off.	1
I purchased as a gift, but he is very cute. Also, much larger than I expected. He is for our daughter-in-law. She is a collector of pigs.	1
Great quality and won't break. Perfect for my two-year-old to carry around. Also, it's quite large. Will hold a lot of pennies!	1
Gift	1
Bought for gift.	1
At first this looked really good, large, hard rubber, looked good. So...we put some coins in and then opened the belly to retrieve them, NO chance of that! The legs are hollow and the coins fall down to the hollow legs and get stuck! How stupid is that?! We will return this if our kid lets us...	-1
We love this piggy bank.  My 2-year-old son had a ceramic bank that he loved carrying around, but unfortunately he dropped it on a hard floor (totally saw THAT coming) and it broke into a million pieces.  He requested a "pink" replacement bank from the purchaser of the original bank (Nana) and she brought him this one.  He loves it!  I like that it's totally kid-proof and he can drop it all he wants.  The scarf is cute, and the bank is totally gender neutral so even though it's pink like he wanted, it's not "girly".  Also, it was the only bank she could find that wasn't covered in licensed characters, which is another plus.  Very cute and durable.  Perfect for a toddler.  My son shakes it and the money does not come out the slot, which was another annoying thing about the old bank.  People mention the dirt, and we have some marks on our pig too, despite it not being purchased from Amazon.  I tried to scrub them off but they don't come off.  One is on the snout and one on the ear.  Some reviewers complain that the money is hard to get out, but I have not found this to be the case.  If you shake the pig vigorously, the money will shake out.  It just takes a little longer than some banks.  They probably should have made the legs solid and not hollow, but it's really not an issue.	1
SO cute!  My daughter LOVED it!  I used it as a prop for a class that was being taught on money management too.  LOVE it.	1
Grandson loved it !	1
MY baby loves it!!! She enjoys putting the coins in. She loves carrying it around. Its a good size piggy bank. It would make a great gift form toddlers.	1
My husband and I had a ball playing this game.  I think people take this game too seriously- it's just a game.	1
This has to be one of the worst games I have ever played. I was so bored, it was sad. My husband kept pointing this game out in stores, so it ended up being a Christmas present. We played it Christmas day and about two days later, we gave it away to a friend of mine who has four teenage and younger boys who MIGHT find it interesting (but probably not). Dumb questions, wrong answers, etc. All the reviews are dead-on. Yes, you can learn from the game, but what??? One of the questions is about how to skin a hide. I'm not going to do that. Are you? And the review about the game being deceptive in size is exactly right. You're talking about a game that you can read the instructions in about one minute and completely understand what to do. Why? Because I'm going to read a question and give three multiple choice answers for you to choose from. The multiple choice answers are so long sometimes that by the time you finish the third one, you have no idea what the first one was, let alone the question. And if you get it right, you are literally going to do nothing more than move your play piece along footprints on a game board toward the finish line. That's it. We love games, have a complete game closet, play with our parents and friends all the time, etc. Trust us... save your money.	-1
This game puts a new meaning to the words "bored game". I would suggest playing this game if you have company over that will never leave because this will encourage them to go. While some of the information is interesting, the game itself is nothing more than answering a general question and moving forward. You'd be better off just purchasing the book instead of the game.	-1
This is a favorite when my grandchildren come to visit. Great way to save some money. And it takes any coin.	1
It's so great to find a piggy bank that is not breakable.  This is really the only piggy bank of I have seen that is a decent size and not made of ceramic or glass.  This piggy bank is a nice size and has survived a lot of drops and falls at our house with no issue. You will feel safe letting your child play with this piggy bank and carry it around.  We have not had any trouble getting the money out - sometimes it does take a shake or to get the money over to the hole in the piggy bank but that is part of the charm of piggy banks.	1
Awesome piggy bank so cute	1
Love it.  I don't have any complaints.  Just right.  Will recommend and reorder more.....	1
Well made, Simple, Classic and Functional.  I love Schylling toys. My only objection is that they do not make more animals.  With multiple children in the family, it would be nice to have different animals for each.  I have given away several of these.	1
This piggy bank is adorable and is a great size, but it came with several brown and black smudges on it that I cannot clean off all the way. Other than that it's super cute.	1
This is basically a toy. I bought it to hold jelly bean candies for my potty-trainer. It worked well for about 4-5 months (no, it didn't take him that long), but then it started getting to where when you rotate the knob it didn't do anything...except rotate. Nothing came out. I emptied it and have yet to try anything else in it (he's too little for gumballs). It worked while it needed to.	1
I love that my little niece can play with this and not break it.  I just wish it was easier to get the money out of the legs of the pig.	1
should have been the real name.. We bought it at a local toy store and I wish I had seen the reviews here before getting it. USUALLY Schylling makes some pretty decent stuff so I didn't even give it a second thought.. The key lock broke the first day.. actually it broke the first time we used it.. the only PLUS to this box is that even though you lose function of the key the dial lock still works..	-1
I buy this piggy bank frequently as a gift for nieces, nephews, and other little ones in my life.  It's as cute as can be and soft enough to be huggable.  One Christmas, I had 4 little girls running around my house cuddling the banks like baby dolls.  I had to give them bath towels to use as baby blankets.  My only tiny negative comment would be that the scarf only comes in one color/print.  I wish they were available in a variety of colors so that children living in the same household could tell their bank's apart. Even if I wasn't allowed to make a specific color choice, a random variety would be nice.	1
The idea is good but I didn't realize that the "alarm" rings EVERYTIME you open the door. It reminds me of a bicycle bell that doesn't stop. If you use it strictly for a bank then you wouldn't open very often. But my daughter likes to store things in and out of it. Aside from the noise, it is very well made out of metal not plastic which is a plus and is a great size.	1
My granddaughter was so excited to be able to hide her secrets and favorite jewelry from her brothers. It seems sturdy and time will tell. Thus far I would recommend it.	1
I bought this for my six year old boy to start learning to save and take care of his money in a fun way. He loved it and it is very cool and vintage-looking. The box feels nice and sturdy, is a great size, and has a coin drop. But after less than a day, it was stuck shut. After fiddling with it for a few minutes, it did come open, but then the latch wouldn't work anymore and the lid wouldn't stay shut. The key never worked very well from the beginning. Fun, but the designers need to work on a more sturdy locking system.	-1
It is perfect for the price.  it is not super sturdy but works every time.  I can refill it and use it over and over.	1
I couldn't find this at Walmart so I purchased this from amazon and the refills from Walmart. Ihave a huge rere filth at we found at Walmart for about 8 bucks. The gumball machine is nice it fits in my daughter's room on her dresser perfectly and she loves it. She's 4 and very happy he has her own gumball machine.	1
Works and looks as described.  Super fun for a little girl.  My 6 year old had no problem learning the combination, and likes the idea of keeping her treasures away from her siblings.	1
Each of our girls have one of these.  I love that they can play with the bank without fear that they will break it.  It's cute too.  The only down side is that the legs are hollow, so getting some of the change out can be a bit of a challenge as the money falls in the legs.  Well made product.	1
Does not work very well.  We usually just unscrew top to get gum instead of turning lever.  I hoped it would be better coming from Schylling.	-1
What a great toy! This surprised me when we got it because it was much better quality than I expected. Way surpassed my expectations and highly recommend as a top notch piggy bank for kids!	1
we are luck that the sky high prices are now lower on this doll as she is a  very attractive doll who makes great addition to any doll collection. After all, a collection of  pretty dolls in big  pink ballgowns gets boring.  This doll is  prefect for adding spice to your dollhouse	1
Granddaughter was thrilled to receive this as she could lock it and keep things inside. However, the locking mechanism was hard to turn initially, and by the end of the day, it wouldn't turn at all.  Her precious birthday earrings and money were inside - locked up. Finally, we were able to force the lock and retrieve her items.  We returned this and purchased another box with four keys, which is working out much better.  Definitely would not recommend.	-1
I bought 3 of these and the kids loved them.  Nicely made.  Very durable and good quality.  Bit expensive I think, but worth it.	1
So thanks to Pinterest, I ordered this as part of the security agent theme we were planning for our ring bearer. It is a cheap safe but worked perfectly for that need. I was sensitive to the weight of most safes as we were going to have a three year old carry it all the way down the aisle by himself. He looked so cute doing it and everyone was raving about it.  Three things, every time you open the safe it has a buzzer that goes off (super annoying). We discovered you could bend the sensor back and it wouldn't buzz (perfect for us as we just wanted to use it instead of the pillow for our rings). I was worried it would get locked as a three year old and his eight year old brother would have time to play with it before we walked down the aisle. Thankfully, if you want the lock to work, you have to use a screwdriver and remove a screw. Needless to say, we didn't remove the screw so you could spin the combination lock but it would never be able to lock. Third, the safe inside is huge compared to the ring box. We solved this by duct taping the ring box to the inside center. The box stayed in place and actually is still attached to it now.  We have the safe next to our wedding book in our bookcase. We will always think of our wedding when we see it. This was a good buy for what we wanted it for but we won't be using it as a piggy bank or locking safe.	1
We had purchased this toy gumball machine for my son's birthday. The idea behind our decision was that it would help him learn the concept of cost.  We knew immediately upon him opening this toy  that it would not last. The quality was very poor, made from cheap and thin plastics that were very breakable. The concept is wonderful but the quality is seriously lacking. We were not surprised when within in the first day of having it, the slot where you place the quarter quit working and the plastic cracked. I would not recommend this particular kind for that reason. It would have been better to go ahead and spend a little but more to get one that would have lasted longer.	-1
I love this pig so much, that I've purchased one for each of my grandchildren. This will be the 5th baby shower (5th grandchild). The pig is made of a soft rubber and large in size. It won't break, if dropped. I've even suggested writing a name on the bottom so the grandchildren don't get them mixed up. It's adorable!	1
I got this for my 3 year old and she loves it.  She's already learning about money and is always pestering me for coins to shove in the pig.  It's a nice heavy vinyl/rubbery material which seems like it could hold up to some toddler abuse.  The plug on the bottom, contrary to some other reviews, a bit too easy to remove for my liking.  I'm sure to find a slaughtered rubber pig with his insides strewn across the living room floor some day.  Not sure why other folks were saying it was so hard to open or get coins out.  My only complaint is that the box packaging rubbed off some color where the pig touched it.  It stained a bit and won't come out, but it's a pig.  I suppose they are meant to be dirty.	1
bought one of these for each of my kids to put their allowance in and they love it.  it looks and operates like the one I had when I was a kid.	1
My toddler really likes putting change his piggy bank. The design is simple but extremely cute and the size is perfect.	1
This pig is great. It's super cute and my oldest has it for years. We write their names on the sides since the bandana get's pulled off. Easy to take money out and put in and holds a lot.	1
BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER....SHE LOVED IT.....IT IS A GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO THE CERAMIC ONE...SO MUCH SAFER.... FOR LITTLE ONES	1
Students get this as an award at the end of the week.  It's a great incentive to keep students on task and behaved	1
Havent used it yet.  Bought it for the ring bearer to carry in a wedding this September.  Its just the right size and I think he will have alot of fun with it later.	1
When we opened the box, the safe had a screw that needed to be removed to make it work. Then we could not figure out how to close it. The dials were so stiff that I was about to send them back until I managed to align the 2 metal parts that keep it locked. There were no instructions to explain what happened or how to fix it. The combination is very touchy and the door was hard to open even when you did get the combination. My grandsons, 5 and 8, have not been able to open and close the safes on their own so the safes are sitting on the floor unused. I had been excited to give them a secret place for their secret items but it is very disappointing. I wish I could have sent them back.	-1
It's a great safe but the corner was dented.  Since it was for a Christmas present, it wasn't worth returning to see if it would arrive on time.	1
It is quite small and looks cheap. It advertises that it comes with gumballs, but only about 15, which hardly covers the bottom.  My daughter like it, but if you buy it plan on having to buy additional gumballs to fill it before you give it as a gift.	-1
This bank is so cute and unbreakable.  The rubber construction makes it perfect for younger children.  I don't have to worry about this breaking!	1
Got this for my 2 yr. old great nephew who wanted a bank. Hopefully, it is indestructible. I know he will be carrying it around. It did arrive with blue marks from the packaging. Removed with magic sponge.	1
My grandchild loves it. I like it because he cannot get to his money!!! I don't know if his mother likes it but I do.	1
Got 3 of these. One for neighbors kids and granddaughter for Christmas in 2011. They are a little cheap with the plastic thing that you put your money in, and sometimes my husband has to work on it, She really loves it, and thats what really counts, comes will gumballs. I go to cvs and buy bagged gumballs fo 99cents to refill	1
my daughter ripped of the bandana but it's still not broken after 2 years. my daughter gets all the leftover change and once the pig is full goes into the bank and is saved.	1
My son loves his piggy bank. It is a good size and it is simply adorable. Whenever he finds change or it is given to me he runs to his room and puts in his piggy bank. He named him Bacon, go figure.	1
My 3 year old son loves this!!  I actually like that its a little hard to open, cause he loves loves loves to take stuff apart.  The pig itself is very durable, he takes it with us to NaNa's and carries around the house.  Drops it all the time, cork doesnt budge and coins do not spill out everywhere.  Easily marked up, because of the material, but after awhile doesnt all thier toys look like that.	1
We have been very pleased with this gumball machine especially given the very low price. 5 year old has managed to get a dime jammed into it a time or two, but we have always been able to get it out with some work and now we have her "trained" on the proper way to line the coin up before turning in order to avoid a jam.  We have not had problems with the bottom coming off as some have noted.  Overall it has been a lot of fun and one of her favorite Christmas presents.	1
Just got it now have to send it back and order another one.  Although the retail packaging seems sufficient and it was packaged appropriately there were dirty marks and rub marks on the snout and ears, which mostly came off with all-purpose cleaner but not all.  Also looks to be some sort of shiny residue on one side, maybe glue that doesn't come off.  No one should have to clean a brand new product to try and make it acceptable for keeping.  That's poor quality.	-1
my son loved it.. I just wishthere was a better way to get coins out of it, coins gets stuck in it. may be I will tae the head off to take coins out	1
This little gumball machine is fantastic for offices or reception areas.  People love a little snack when they check in or stop by someone's office.  Plus gum balls are a delicious retro candy that everyone loves!  The pink ones are my favorite.	1
Overall, this gumball machine is not worth the money as it is very poorly made.  The positive and negatives are:  Positive: 1.  It's all plastic which is great for a younger child.  Higher-end gumball machines have a glass bowl that in my mind are not not suited for younger kids due to safety reasons.  My child knocks her's over all the time.  Negatives: 1.  The unit is very poorly made:   1a.  I have a higher-end unit from another company that works ok.  My daughter gets considerable excitement when she puts in a coin, turns the handle, and gets a gumball.  However, this unit's coin mechanism is terrible.  You can turn it without a coin and get a gumball taking away all the excitement.  She likes to use mine instead.  This takes the whole fun out of having it for her.  As a side effect, she knows she can get gumballs without money so guess how fasts the gum lasts.   1b.  See other reviews of how the bottom falls off easily.   1c.  The top snaps on and easily comes off and gets lost.	-1
Times are tough all over. The economy's circling the bowl, and most of our cash is being flushed down with it. But some financial fat cat once said you have to spend money to make money -- Alan Greenspan? Donald Trump? Scrooge McDuck? I forget -- so I've been on the lookout for products to help me invest more jackpottily for the future.  I figured the least I could do is save my money securely. So I bought this bank and stuffed my change into it for the last few weeks. That worked great.  Only now I need to get my money OUT, and the pig isn't having it. I tried shaking it through the hole in the bottom, sucking it out with a vacuum cleaner, even reaching in with salad tongs like I was playing a game of for-profit porcine Operation. Nada.  Reluctantly, I finally decided to smash the thing with a hammer. Unfortunately, I forgot that the bank's made of rubber -- not ceramic -- so instead of breaking it, the hammer bounced back and I smacked myself in the eye.  Now I've got a shiner, and all my money for an ice pack is in the stupid pig. I've heard of 'penalties for early withdrawal', but this is ridiculous.	1
Piggy banks are a great way to encourage kids to save.  I like the classic ceramic ones but this rubber one is likely to last longer.  I like the sort of inquisitive look it has.	1
My daughter found the first one we have at a resale shop. She fell in love with it! I was curious about the cute little piggy sitting on the floor in the corner of her room so....... I flipped him over and saw the name Schylling on the little guy's foot. I looked it up on google and found one on Amazon. He is so cute I bought her another one. She is learning the value of money and has filled up the first one we had and is on the fast track to fill the new one. I think that if you teach children at a young age to save money for the things they really want, teaches them to be wise with money and it helps them in the long run.  Hope this comment helps and He/She is a lot cuter in person! Shipped very fast.	1
Received the pigs in very good order.  Not a spot on either one of them.  I bought them for a friend's twins' 1st birthday, coming up in May.  They had been given two large, ceramic pigs as gifts that she will not use because they're breakable.  She is going to regift them.  I thought this would be the perfect piggy for the twins to "grow into."  I did try the coin release on the belly and it is difficult . . . but if a parent has to help, so be it.  Overall, I am satisified and hope they will be too.  I will try the cotton balls in the legs suggestion, as it does seem as if coins will get lodged in there.  I haven't deposited coins yet so don't know how that will be.  May be a tad heavy for little ones, but my view, again, was to have something that they could use and enjoy for years to come, with no catastrophic accidents.  Very pleased, and very pleased with Amazon.	1
I was worried after reading other reviews that I would have trouble getting coins out of this piggy, but it has a large opening at the bottom, and the slot at the top is large too. It is well made and very durable. I picked this bank out for my son so that I would not have to worry about him dropping and breaking it, and I know now I made the right choice. This will last a lifetime, undoubtedly.	1
I bought two of these piggy banks for my sons. They are very cute, seem very durable, and seem like they will hold lots of coins. It is easy to get the coins out again from the bottom of the pig. I was looking for banks that will hold up when dropped and thrown around, and I think these will work well.	1
My 4 year old son really loves this piggy bank. I love that I don't have to worry about him breaking it. I had read from other reviews that the bottom part where you empty the coins out was hard to open, but ours is not too hard at all. I actually wish it were harder to open so my son would have to ask for help whenever he wants to dump out his coins. But it's a cute, durable and pretty good sized little bank.	1
it is hard to find a plastic piggy bank. I searched all over for one! This is perfect for my kiddos who are constantly dropping their piggy banks and breaking them. Bought this for my DS who is 3 and LOVES it!	1
I purchased this piggy bank as a gift for our three and half year old cousin.  She wanted a piggy bank for Christmas.  I looked high and low for a cute, durable piggy bank.  It is simply adorable.  It will be durable for a little girl to love for many years to come.	1
I bought this piggy bank for a little boy so he could learn about saving and also play with it and not be worry about it breaking. The pig was really cute and his parents told me he really liked to play with it. I bought a book called : "My pink piggy bank" to go with it. I am planning to by another one and also another book. It was a very popular gift.	1
Liked this bank because its old school with a modern twist,looks like a cute little piggy. Nice size so the coins will add up. Made of rubber so so you don't have to worry about it breaking.	1
I puchased this for my granddaughter to help teach her to save money. She has a blast selling the gumballs to her friends.  For such a simple toy she sure does play with it a lot.	1
I ordered this for my grandson's 3rd birthday.  I wanted something he could carry around and wouldn't break on him.  First of all, this piggy bank is the most adorable thing I've ever seen.  I knew it looked cute in the picture, but it's even cuter in person.  Secondly it's much larger than I expected, so it will hold a lot of money.  He's very excited about having coins and dollars so teaching him to save it in this piggy bank will be great.  This is a must for anyone looking for a cute, durable piggy bank the little ones can have.	1
I was so excited to get this for my 4 y/o daughter for Christmas. Although it is indeed "cute" - the latch/lock is terribly hard to get open, so much so that she doesn't even want to use it. It's made cheaply IMO, and for the price, I don't think it was worth it.	-1
My 3-year-old likes her piggy bank.  It is good for using it to teach her the names and sizes of coins.  I can't say that she has had very much fun with it, but she does think it's a cute pig whose head turns side to side.  A piggy bank is good for teaching kids about saving and sharing, and this is one of the cutest.  I didn't find that stuffing cotton balls in the feet is a good idea.  The cotton balls just fell out when it was turned over.  I don't know how we'll get the coins out...	1
I ordered this for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter.  She was so excited when she saw it, she gave it a big hug.  She could not wait to raid my purse for coins.  Earlier reviewers voiced concerns about this piggy.  I have no worries about my granddaughter's safety playing with this bank.  The neckerchief adds to this pig's personality.  We like the blue check.  Earlier reviews  reported scuffs on the bank.  Ours arrived in perfect condition.  This is a fun and sturdy toy/savings tool.	1
I bought this bank for my 3 year old daughter. She loves it--it's everything all the reviewers said, cute, durable, etc...  BUT! It's VERY VERY VERY HARD to get the coins back out the bottom. There's a "lip" of rubber all around the edge of the opening that makes it nearly impossible to get your finger in and scoop out coins. Plus, the pig's legs are hollow. When you shake the bank to get all the coins to the bottom so you can get them out, most of them fall into the legs. It's very frustrating for her, and even I have a hard time when she asks me to fish out her money for her.	-1
Schylling makes high-quality toys and I own many of their products. This rubber piggy bank continues their tradition of excellence.  However, this bank is either for very young children - which, based on many of the reviews posted here, are babies and toddlers (despite manufacturer recommendations of 3 years and up) - or older children. I do not recommend this bank for the mid-range child, ages 4-8 years.  Turns out that my children wanted to see their savings add up. A clear glass piggy bank and a counting jar replaced this otherwise outstanding gift given to both my 4-year old son and 6-year old daughter.  For durablity, safety and styling, this is a great product, but for kids who are developing money sense, stick with the traditional glass or see-through models.	1
We looked all over for a sturdy piggy bank for my toddler. This one has worked out great! It is a good size and so far has been indestructible. My son loves adding money to it and every time he finds spare change he runs to put it in his "pig!" This is a good gift for a child.	1
My seven year old niece had a tea party theme for her birthday, so this was a perfect gift! She worked on it with my ten year old daughter, and they completed it in one full day. The finished product is great. This is not a cheaply made tea set that's going to break the first time you play with it. My only complaint was that every color of paint was too thick so we had to add water. I should have taken the advise of another reviewer and only added a few drops. I made the yellow a bit too runny.	1
I agree with everyone about this product, except for the paint (we had enough & it wasn't too thick).  My daughter loved doing this (over a few days) and she was thrilled to have a real ceramic (still breakable) tea set.  BUT you can not put liquid in the cups if they were painted inside -- or outside for that matter.  My daughter painted the entire cup inside and out. THe paint easily came off with the water sitting in the cup (and so I am not sure why we baked it!). That was disapointing as she wanted to have a real tea party. The directions note that the paint becomes permanent, but they recommend decorative only.  I thought that it was just CYA on their part and didn't think the paint would actually come off.  Perhaps it's just me and others didn't assume so much.  So, don't soak the painted items in water as the paint will lift off.  This is the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars.  Storage note: we saved the box to store the pieces so they didn't get broken.  Age Note: my daugter is 6-1/2; she's very girly & loves art projects, so this was a perfect gift for her.	1
Unlike some of their other models, this Revell is extremely easy to put together. While it advertises itself as a "snap-tite" set, realistically you will need to glue many points together if you intend to use it in wargaming.  The display base is okay, but I would prefer a more war-gamer friendly one that is a little easier to base with terrain, but that is a minor quibble. It has been awhile since I put this one together, but I don't recall a decal sheet; for some reason model companies rarely seem to include them with models that are primarily 'American' forces. I have purchased over a dozen from different companies and have yet to see a single identifiable American flag.  My only real complaint is that the plastic seemed impossible to paint. I wash and dry all model sprues thoroughly, but despite my precautions, paint still seemed to just slough off, leading to a rougher paint job than I like. I have only ever had this happen with one other plastic model, and that one was a similar tint of plastic, but a different company.	1
Boys loved putting together and playing with them.  Be careful because can snap pieces easily.  Especially the rotor on top.	1
over priced	-1
Great price and perfect for our purposes.  Oddly there was one hard spot on the ball but otherwise had some foam-like give to all of it, making it easy to use for kids	1
This is good for indoor use, and okay for outdoor use. If you get hit in the face with it, it will not hurt. It is also better for younger kids to throw because of its low weight.	1
The quality is not like the old nerf balls they made in the 80s.  But this is not a nerf football and nerf doesn't make them like this anymore.  So this is the next best thing. I miss better quality stuff from back in the days.	1
This was a little bigger than I though it was going to be (probably normal size football) so it's hard for my younger kids to grasp, but it's made well and soft enough that no one gets hurt!	1
Just like the good old days.  Product is plastic (maybe not like the good old days).	1
I played with this a lot when I was a kid and I hope my son enjoys his as much as I did mine!  Makes a great stocking stuffer!	1
Endless combos keep it interesting and the quality of the metal squares make this great to keep around and in a pocket.	1
keeps kids engaged	1
Great fun!  Good quality.	1
My 8 year old daughter loves this puzzle keeps her thinking for hours	1
This game-puzzle is a nice way to relax and just enjoy trying to solve the puzzle.  It will be used as a stocking stuffer at Christmas.  I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys a brain teaser!	1
great old fashion game to keep in your purse	1
smaller then i thought, but it works well..	1
I had one of these as a kid.  I never realized there were so many different ways to do the puzzle.  It comes with great directions.  I keep one in each of my vehicles and have something to do when stuck in traffic.	1
Brought back great 40 yr old memories, still can't solve it!!	1
Good for older children that really not like floor puzzles any more	1
Great non electronic game for all ages!	1
Love, love, love!	1
A lovely gift for a 10 year old grandson who likes to have something in his pocket at all times.	1
Grandkids love it! What is "old" is new again!	1
love playing with this	1
Nice puzzle. It slides really nicely so you can go really fast. Only problem I faced was sliding too fast/hard and the piece gets a little jammed out of place	1
Really like that the pieces of this seem very sturdy.	1
great I loved it	1
Non-electronic fun.  Great alternative for a kid to kill some time.	1
Great Easter basket fun for kids and adults liked it also	1
This is one of the best stocking stuffers I ever purchased.  It's still entertaining my husband months after the holidays!	1
We keep at least one of these 15-puzzles in every vehicle.  The kiddoes love them on car trips; they even do timed competitions with varying rules for possible number and sequence combinations.  And for sick or injured youngsters, who need to stay quiet, it's a calming amusement when played solo.  (Of course, the educational value goes unremarked!)  Recommended	1
I had high hopes as I have used these before but this one was very cheaply made.  The tiles get stuck, and are hard to move at times. I would not suggest buying this as it is more frustrating to use than it is to figure out any of the games to do.	-1
Its a puzzle ==you get the numbers mixed up and then have to move them one at a time to get them in order.  This is very high quality and will last a lifetime if you take care of it.  Comes with a vinyl envelope to keep it clean.	1
I bought this for my special ed kids and they enjoyed it.	1
Reminds me of my childhood.	1
Great compact game! My daughter and I love to race to see who can do it the fastest! I use to win, not anymore! LOL. It's a fun challenging compact game you can take anywhere. Not getting any younger! Have to keep the brain sharp! It is a great toy for kids and adults. Sturdy metallic material, doesn't get jammed when playing which is extremely important, otherwise it would be extremely frustrating!	1
OH MY SO GLAD I FOUND THIS.  NOTHING LIKE FINDING A TOY YOU PLAYED WITH AS A KID.  I SHOWED THIS TO A FRIEND AND SHE GOT SO EXCITED.  SHE JUST MIGHT GET ONE FOR CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR...	1
I like the case it comes in. I am not so crazy about the metal material it is made of because it doesn't allow to slide easily. It is an okay-manufactured (or designed or both) game.	1
This is a replica of the original classic "Fifteen" puzzle with instructions. Real metal. Retro design. Comes with a little pouch.	1
This puzzle is sturdy, but the numbers do tend to hang up. I bought it for my elderly mother to use to help her pass the time. But, with the numbers getting caught so easily, I will keep the puzzle for personal use. The puzzle is just not good for very arthritic hands.	1
This 15 Puzzle is one of the all time most popular puzzles--right up there with Rubik's Cube. I have loved puzzles of all kinds ever since I was a kid,over 70 years ago. The 15 Puzzle was probably my first puzzle and it has always challenged ,entertained and fascinated me .I have had many,many versions of it over the years.  This one by Binary Arts/ThinkFun is one of my favorites for several reasons. It is extremely well made of metal,the tiles slide exceptionally well and do not fall out,and it is quite small,2 1/2" X 2 1/2" X 1/4",and comes with a leatherette carrying case and even a tiny 14 page pamphlet that has a bit of information on the puzzle and 40 problems to solve. This pamphlet also fits in the carrying case.  If you are interested in more information on this puzzle,I strongly suggest you get The 15 Puzzle Book" by Jerry Slocum and Dic Sonneveld and/or "The Famous 15 Puzzle" a beautiful boxed set including a magnificent wooden puzzle and a book about the puzzle and the world wide craze it created in 1880,also by Slocum and Sonneveld.  These two books are filled with all kinds of information,history,illustrations and details on solving various problems and arrangements. I have reviewed both of them.	1
It's a nice little game.  The little case is nice to have as well.  The only complaint is that the pieces don't always slide very smoothly.	1
I remember playing with these when I was a little girl.  This is a very well made little puzzle with it's own carrying case.  It is well constructed and durable.  Perfect for taking on plane trips or car trips, as it is not that easily solved and can hold the attention for quite a while.  I find that even adults want to play this for lengthy amounts of time. I bought this for my grandson for Christmas and he loved it.  A great little gift!	1
I've owned this puzzle for a few years now & never had any problem with the tiles sticking. Maybe they've changed it in some way. My stainless steel puzzle with the numbers in enamel is approx. 2.25" square and came with a nice pouch and and  a booklet which has more challenges in it. The booklet can be stored in the pouch along with the game. I carry the puzzle in my purse & pull it out whenever I find myself waiting...like in traffic or a doctor's waiting room.  If you're not familiar with this game, the idea is to mix up the tiles then put them back into numeric order. The booklet contains challenges which have you put the numbers in many different orders.	1
My son enjoys playing with this toy, and it is a good quality toy that should last a long time.	1
I had saved this in my wish list and had been  watching the price and purchased it when it was about $5+ something! I have 4 kids (8, 7, 4, 2) and whenever we are in the middle of something(doctor's office, waiting for the performance, picking up older kids), I get this out of my purse and let them play with it. They never get tired of it and it is very durable since it is metal.  When I got the first one, the number '7' didn't slide well so I returned it and got a new one.  It is so small and slim that fits in my little purse perfect. I love it!	1
I collect Monopoly board games. This is by far the most beautiful Monopoly game ever. If you are a Simpson fan that's a bonus. The board features almost every place in Springfield from the Kwik-E-Mart to Mr. Burns Manor. You could spend hours looking at every little and totally hilarious details. The game tokens are very nice plus you have the option to purchase other limited edition game tokens which are very cool by the way. The property deeds are a work of art. And on plus side if you have children and want to interest them in math and strategy while having fun you can not go wrong with this one. One more thing; if you do deside to purchase this game and plan on using it you better buy more than one or you will find yourself making your friends wash their hands before they could even think of touching it. Do yourself a favor and buy this game. Have fun.	1
As the subject says, this is a no frills attached nice toy. The only thing that surprised me is the size, its smaller than what I expected especially if you have big hands. But anyways, looks durable lets see if lasts for a long time	1
This puzzle has a fantastic retro/classic look and feel about it.  This has held the attention of my 6 yr old son.  It comes with instructions or ideas on different ways to have the numbers sequenced.  This would be a great toy to bring out on a long flight or car ride.  Will keep them puzzled for hours!	1
Our 9-year-old saw one of the kids at school play with this. So of course the nagging started as soon as we got home. Fortunately, I remember this puzzle since when I was a kid and had no problem giving in....  :-)  Also: - it is inexpensive (unlike the playstation and x-box); which is a huge benefit, since we have 3 kids and things like this have to be bought in triplicate - it is made of metal, so that even our 5-year-old couldn't break it - IT IS GREAT FUN	1
I had one of these when I was a Brownie girl scout, many, MANY years ago, but mine was plastic and the tiles popped off the frame frequently.  This little beauty is well made; the tiles move smoothly and it's small and lightweight.  We carried this on the plane from Chicago to Krakow, Poland and my 4 -year- old loved it. He sorted evens from odds, tried to put the numbers in correct order, etc.  My husband had never seen it, so he grabbed it when ds fell asleep and then HE played with it.  I'd say it's a hit and for the price, this is an excellent buy.  Plus, the shot of nostalgia you'll receive when you play it gives you a nice warm fuzzy that'll last all day.  CAUTION: if your child is 3 or under, don't give it to them for unsupervised play, as it may just be possible to pop the tiles out of the frame, if they are very strong and try very hard. They seemed secure to me, but the tiles are itty bitty and are of metal with enamel fill. They WILL grab it because it's "pwitty" and WILL shake it, as it sounds a bit like maracas when they do, so please wath out for this.	1
This little Fifteen Puzzle, a number puzzle, haunts me from childhood. I'm 57 years old now and remember many lazy afternoons (can you recall any lazy afternoons lately?!!) I spent endlessly lining up the numbers in my small, plastic Fifteen Puzzle. I did not even know then that the puzzle had that name! It was just so much fun, and so absorbing, to sit under a tree somewhere and line up these numbers. This tiny game seems a bit primitive now with computers and all the technology we enjoy in 2007, but if you're stuck in the doctor's office or anywhere else where you can't escape, this little puzzle is fun to carry around.	1
I have never been much of a fan of Monopoly however this edition made the experience of losing in Monopoly to my husband more fun!  :)  I love the simpsons and the creators of this game did a great job.	1
If you are a monopoly or Simpsons collector, or both, then you MUST have this game.  I am both and I collect versions of Monopoly, and I must say this has become my favorite edition by far, even better than the Treehouse of Horror edition.  The pieces are fun, the cards are fun, the money is fun, this entire package is just amazing as both a Simpsons toy and a great board game.	1
This is an extremely great version of what is the greatest board game ever created.  The rules are of course exactly the same but the Simpsons properties, money, Chance and Community Chess cards and everything else make it a fresh experience.  The fact that the game board and game tokens are monorail themed does date it a little reducing it to a four and a half star rating. I would have preferred it wasn't that way with just the four train stations monorail themed.  It is still great though but I would also like to have seen more game tokens of the other family members especially Grandpa and Maggie, and also other characters like Mr Burns in addition or instead of the doughnut.  They could have also put Snake in the jail cell on that corner of the board rather than the traditional Monopoly criminal icon and Chief Wigum on the Go to Jail Square but maybe I'm just being picky.  This is an excellent gift idea for anyone who even only occasionally enjoys the Simpsons and a must for anyone who is a fan.  Also recommended to enjoy the game even more is Monopoly Companion The Players Guide by Philip Orbanes. This book will refresh the rules and save arguments and even teach you some, such as I never knew the number of houses was limited for a reason so that you could strategise and not buy hotels to stop someone else with a set from building.  Just buy the game, you won't be disappointed!	1
Without going on too long, it's Monopoly.  The cards are changed only enough so that the characters from the show are depicted, but the chance and community chest cards' text/instructions are no different than the classic game.  That was a disappointment. However, the board and tokens are enough to get a true Simpsons fan to love this edition.  The richly drawn board takes you all over Springfield, with amusing little goings-on on the surface.  Overall, it's little different from the regular game, once you take out the incredible richness of being involved in the Simpsons'crazy world.	1
We bought these for my 17 month old son, despite his lack of interest in Megablocks and Duplo. They aren't too difficult to assemble, but the instructions could be better. By the time we had the first two blocks assembled, my son was already stacking them. This is a great rainy day activity for the whole family (mom, dad and child). We spent several hours yesterday building towers and castles and knockling them down. My son also uses the pieces for imaginative play (who would have thought a blue piece + a yellow piece = a telephone?). I can tell these are going to be a favorite for years to come - I'm going to order more!	1
fun times are being had with these	1
hrs of fun	1
Grandsons loved them	1
I have had these for a year in my daycare. I really thought they were going to get ruined because they are made of cardboard. They are in great shape. However, you MUST glue them at the seams after you fold them up, (assemble) otherwise they will not sit flat on top of each other.	1
assembly required!  but once you get the hang of it/ they are easy to put together	1
for grandson; just like the one my son used 30 years ago, except they included one extra small blue block with this shipment	1
I spent hours putting these together for my 4-year-old son's birthday and he's spent maybe 10 minutes playing with them in the four months since. They looked so cool in the picture, but in reality they take up a lot of space in his room and aren't easy to stack on carpet. There weren't enough of the large red ones to make forts. Perhaps a younger child would get a kick out of these.	-1
My grandson loves to build forts, so this is perfect for rainy days or cold days when he can't play outside.	1
they are easy to put together and in various sizes. My 1 year old son loves to knock them over and stand on them. They are durable enough for him to stand on and they don't get one dent in them.	1
These are just what I expected and wanted. The ratio between sizes teaches early math skills.  They were easy to assemble.	1
I love these because they're light and when your child builds a tower and then Godzillas through it, it doesn't sound like your house is falling apart. Great for rainy day indoor play.	1
They assemble SO easily even grandpa could do it!  :)  We built a castle, crashed through, children can stand on them, they are coated & can be wiped off, I definately recommend.	1
I saw these blocks in the daycare and thought they were awesome. Got them for my 4 and 1 year olds in the summer and they have been a big hit. It took about 10 minutes to put together all the blocks once I figured out the instructions. When you build with them try to keep the seem on the side (vs the top or the bottom) - this makes them more sturdy. I also plan to get the set of only the biggest size ones to have even more building material. Now the only problem is storage - right now they are just stacked in night in a corner of the playroom but I would like to figure out a basket or box large enough to fit them but light enough to move...	1
Our son at 11 months is too young for these. He tries to eat them, and the cardboard dye comes off in his mouth. But, we plan to keep them for later because I can see them being loads of fun. You do have to make the blocks when you first get them.	1
These cardboard blocks are strong, well-designed, and easy to put together.  I originally got a set of the red ones which were all the same size and my then 3-year old daughter played with them making them into roads for her cars and later on into buildings and gates for her stuffed animals.  Now at age 5 I got her this set and she makes towers and castles using the multiple sizes and colors which adds more flexibility to her creations.  The blocks are strong enough for her to stand on (she's still only 33 pounds at age 5) and are durable enough to withstand constant knocking down.  They do puncture a bit if something sharp hits the sides of them.  Overall, it's been fun to see her development and continues love of these blocks.	1
Play food - marvellous stuff. My daughters love it. They use it for tea parties, to learn fruit and vegetable name/colours/shapes. They pretend to go shopping, they love to pile everything in the basket and just carry it around. They feed fruit to their teddys and dolls and to me. There is so much you can do with play food - they use their imagination to play the game and I no longer find food missing from our fruit bowl or vegetable crisper in toy boxes! All the fruit and vegetables fit in this basket and can be easily carried around. The fruit and vegetables are made of strong plastic and have held up quite well despite being thrown, stood on, chewed and thrown in the bath.  Easy to wash in warm soapy water to keep clean.	1
My grandchildren love to play with these toys and it keeps them busy when they come over to visit for the day.	1
The paint doesn't come off though my boys love to put their mouths to the toys. When it arrives, it doesn't have the cheap plastic smell that some new toys have. The only downside is that the boys don't love like to play with it (hence four stars), but it's a product well made.	1
So realistic the little ones try to munch on them. The celery stalk became a great teether for my youngest granddaughter.	1
Very realistic, quality play shopping tools, and great  tools for teaching sharing. Recreates the shopping a la carte experience with a colorful variety of safe pieces for ages 3 and older.	1
My grandson enjoys his toy kitchen and his shopping cart - this is a fun addition so he can 'shop' like Mom and have food for the refrigerator and pantry.  Pieces are large, colorful and well made.  Other than the dog trying to slink off with the head of lettuce it is a great addition.	1
My grand-daughter loves to carry the basket and uses it to store various things.  She is learning to identify fruits and vegetables.  I recommend this item.	1
These are some of the best made fake food products that I've seen. Very realistic looking. The kids love playing with these in their shopping cart and register.	1
I sent this to my niece for Christmas. I was told the fruits were life size, came with the basket, and was a really fun set. I'm glad she liked this!	1
Bought this one among many other Learning Resources food sets for my kids play kitchen and grocery store. Durable, cute, fairly realistic and easy to clean. There aren't many pieces of food for the price but the cute basket kind of makes up for that.	1
I bought this for my little boy, since he loves to pretend about food. But I found it only held his attention for a short time.  I like the basket for storage, and the veggies look real.  But he started to throw the round shaped veggies around the house, calling them balls, and I guess his age group is not getting the concept here.  So I have put this toy away, at least for a while.	1
The food is fun to play with and is very realistic looking, but each piece is a little big for pretend eating.  Love the basket that the food comes in.	1
My mom bought this for my daughter to go with her kitchen, grocery cart and cash register. The food is colorful and it a wonderful size. The basket is sturdy. I'm happy my children have this item.	1
This is a great set of play food.  VERY durable (i.e. won't be flattened with a little one chewing or stepping on it).  It looks realistic too.  The basket it comes in is also good quality (not cheap like other play food baskets).  Highly recommend spending a little bit extra on this play food vs. buying cheap.  This holds up!	1
This was actually a gift for a little three year old, for her new kitchen, she enjoys them very much.	1
I have purchased many of the Learning Resources Food Baskets. They are all AWESOME! They look realistic and are high quality. Best play food that you can buy!	1
I was expecting better quality in the game pieces.	-1
I forgot how boring this is. Don't waste your time.	-1
My family could not get into this game. Not the greatest quality either.	-1
Press-your-luck dice game where the gimmick is the dice are shaped like pigs.  That's all.	-1
The pigs are very small. Would be a great game for travel. But my family didn't get into it and we love games. Wasn't that fun. I will stick with a deck of face cards.	-1
Got this game for Xmas from my adult son and have had so much fun playing it with both children and adults.  The pigs are much quieter than regular dice and tend not to bounce off of the tabletop.  It is very compact -- fits nicely in my purse.  You can't go wrong with this fun game, but don't be greedy and be sure to pass the pigs before you pig out!	-1
Goes great with horses.... my granddaughter loves it	-1
Again the pieces are so tiny you cannot realistically use them, especially kids it's just too small to handle	-1
Trash trash trash. Sending it back. Flimsy cheap plastic. Not at all happy.	-1
The sticks are really thin, much thinner than a stirrer straw. You could get about four/five sets in the tin which is really big. It was cheap but still over-valued.	-1
terrible,  they are so small you can't play with them.  very disappointed !	-1
You remember those thick, sturdy jacks you or your sister or cousin played with?  These are not those.  Neither are the pick-up sticks.  The sticks are thinner than wooden skewers you might use for cheese or appetizers.  A definite no to these.	-1
This product includes 30 small pick-up sticks - an embarrassingly small bundle. They are made of plastic, and each has a pronounced seam along the edge, which affects gameplay. Please, don't waste your time and money. Look elsewhere for a decent product.	-1
This game has all the bells and whistles that are perfect for 6 & 7-year-olds: bunnies, carrots and hot pursuit to the top of the bunny hill!  Unfortunately, the "holes" are pretty predictable, and anyone can easily figure out how to avoid them. We played and played the game and not a single person's bunny was lost. Until we began to TRY to get them sunk.  Since the first day we got it, there has been no child-driven interest in playing this game again.  I am so glad that I didn't pay for Funny Bunny, I would have felt ripped off.	-1
My then six-year-old got this game as a gift a few years ago.  I'll be honest - I don't know who Uncle Wiggly is, so maybe I'm missing out on some of the charm, but it's basically Candyland with numbers - purely luck based with no thought involved.  We may have played it twice before permanently shelving it.  This may be okay for a four-year-old that is learning to count, but even then it probably won't be interesting for long.  There are words on the cards, but there is no reason to read them, the number of spaces that should be moved is in large print.  Kids are smarter than we give them credit for - there are lots of simple games that kids can start out with that are not based on 100% luck and require a little thought and interaction such as Busy Town, Memory, checkers, chess, Stratego, and as they progress, many great Eurogames.	-1
I don't know what it is with Amazon lately but nearly 75% of my big ticket items are openbox even though I pay the new price for them. This arrive scratched and dirty and was an Xmas gift for my son So of course once he tealized what it was we couldn't just tell him "nope! It has to go back."  It is a really cute and fun toy. Love that the cart has a place for them to put their feet up because I was definitely worried about them dangling as he rode down. He enjoys it but I would suggest always supervising your young child on it. My son is 2 and always holds onto the cart when he climbs on and the wheels get to slipping. So I suggest being there to hold it steady. Overall a great fun toy for a little adventurer.	-1
I bought this for my 18 month old son. A few warnings on this product: First it's pretty big and you need to give your kid lots of landing space room once they slide down and off ramp...most people have this outdoors for that reason. Although my son loved this toy and had a blast, I think it's still too unsafe to leave him to It by himself, I'd say it's better for kids 3-5 aged.  Plus is that it's super super easy to assemble..no screws. The car comes assembled, and the ramps are 4 parts that just slide and click into place. Also not that heavy since it's made from plastic. Warning it does come in large shipping box.	-1
This is The ONLY Toy that we have seen having 5 Star Reviews !!! Thats why we bought it immediately without thinking much even though it was VERY Expensive. Do NOT Rely on Reviews !!! Its WORTHLESS. One of the reviews I read that their son HIMSELF plays with it - its a LIE, you have to be there for safety AND you have to push it. when my son pushes it himself (after we request him 100 times) it doesn't go too far, no wonder he doesnt wanna do it himself. so basically after first use for just within 5 minutes I wanted to return it its that worthless !  BUT we didn't not know abt the HIDDEN TRICK, its NOT RETURNABLE !!! :O what a HORROR for a $100 item ! But i think since we are Prime Members and buy a lot of stuff on amazon they refunded us... RELIEF.................. Thank you Amazon for that !	-1
Initially I thought this was a really cute toy - the projector is an engaging feature and the music is soft and not too annoying.  However, there are several problems we had with this toy.  First the projector, which worked for awhile, starting going out for no reason.  You are able to turn the projector off by design to save batteries, which is great, but we were frequently unable to turn it back on - figured it was just a glitch.  But then the sound/music went out too!  It would be singing just fine, then would randomly, and LOUDLY, give off a static noise (which sounded like a phone dial tone.)  I had to take a screw driver and remove the back of the toy so I could pull the batteries out in order for it to shut up!  I think this toy is a little pricey to be so junky!  My son liked the toy while it lasted, which was only about 2 months =(.  My only other complaint is that the straps that connect the toy to baby's crib are made for cribs with skinny rails - our crib by design has sort of thicker rails and I had a heck of a time attaching it to the crib - just FYI.  Overall, I would NOT recommend this crib toy - too expensive and too much hassle for something that breaks so easily.	-1
This thing will eat through batteries.  Have to buy new ones at least once a week.  If you buy rechargeable they will last 2 to 3 days.  I think this is because it is sound activated.	-1
Please see the added edited ending of this review! I originally gave this a one star rating and said 'Don't waste your money', but I have changed my mind! Amazon won't let me change the stars, but I'd give it 4, only because I had to fix it myself with no help from V-Tech...  We already have a battery operated soother on all three of our kid's bed-rails and yet, when I saw this on sale, I grabbed it up as well, thinking I would replace one of the older models (in particular, a Leapfrog star-shaped soother called the 'Dreamscapes Soother' which is just kind of boring and a real battery eater). Anyhow, my 19 month old son just loves this new one, and clearly prefered it to the Leapfrog one, but the thing quickly began to emit these awful squeaks that grow louder and louder each day and cause my boy to go from sort-of sleepy to wild-eyed in under a minute! At least the boring-non-squeaking-or-shrieking Leapfrog actually soothed him to sleep!  I called V-tech, and after much inquiry and time spent on the phone I was finally told they no longer make this (obviously problematic) version and so would be getting a completely different replacement if I paid to send mine in to them. Good deal? Not really, plus all of the 'help' from Vtech on the phone were so nonchalant and uninformed (three different people) that I actually don't think I want another Vtech product! And the reviews here all confirm my worst suspicions; that this is a cute but worthless piece of junk. (old opinion.  Check out my new opinion at the end of this)  However, Do buy the older (4 yrs old? and still going strong!) Fisher Price Aquarium Soother (the one with actual water in it, that has a 'mama fishy and baby fishy' that 'swim' around - maybe try eBay?). This one  keeps my daughter well 'soothed' every night, with no piercing squeak/shrieks and no creepy voice and pleasant music(!) and also the still available Fisher Price Flutterby Dreams Soother (with sweet Mama and baby blue birds and the cutest overhead light show) is my eldest son's favorite one of all.  NEW OPINION: Added Nov. 8th, 2007:  If you take all the screws out of the back, including one hidden inside of the battery compartment, you can open this thing, carefully keeping wires intact!  Then, pretending you are a bank-robber/safe-breaker, turn the machine on (re-insert batteries for this, obviously) and LISTEN for exactly where the squeak/shriek comes from...I actually used a paper towel tube to 'listen' through to better isolate the noise...and FOUND that it was coming from an over-tightened screw that holds a tiny piece of plastic against the revolving light disk.  I simply loosened the screw and IT WORKS GREAT NOW!  So, sorry about the stars, Amazon won't let me change those, but we use this soother every single nap time and bedtime and Really appreciate the way it turns itself on if our baby starts to cry loudly enough....it does actually soothe now, now that it has stopped shrieking!  YAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY!	-1
The Barbie Holiday doll 2001 is ok I say this because i was not very pleased with my purchase. This doll's dress feels cheap and well, is just not what i was expecting but i like the doll face a lot better than the barbie faces now but overall this doll wasent what i was expecting.	-1
I paid almost $6 for this assuming it was a lot more web than I could buy at the store. Theres one small little wad of webbing at the bottom of the bag, less than the nearly identical bag at the dollar store for $1 (which also contained the spiders). Dont waste your money.	-1
Not as advertised. I received a different brand that is very cheap and poor quality. I'm disappointed.	-1
Not a quality product--difficult to stretch, difficult to affix, difficult to work with. I would not recommend these to a friend.	-1
Maybe I don't have the skills or patience, but after 30 minutes of trying to untangle this web, I gave up!  Sticking with the cotton webs.	-1
Way too much money for something that should cost a $1. I feel ripped off.	-1
Does not come with Spiders. Since when does spider webs NOT come with little plastic spiders? What a way to be cheap. Thumbs down.	-1
too messy	-1
We received it opened and used. Sent back.	-1
The product I received was not the same as that advertised. Very small amount of web. If I had known what they would send I would have purchased elsewhere.	-1
Bring in the NASA folks to understand these directions...you got to lay 3 cards here and 4 cards there and hold 6 cards and remember this litany of 'hog washes' and 'ewe turns' and so forth...just no fun--I've read the instructions 10 times--still not getting it...here's a typlical excerpt:  '...draw 1 card (unless you do a ewe turn and then you switch hands and turn backward) then proceed counter clockwise starting from youngest to oldest...here is the pile you are trying to get rid of...after everyone has used up all of their cards, the person with no cards left (one having gone out first) can draw 3 pigs, the person going out next (not the winner, the one who went out after the first place person) can draw 2 pigs...'.  Anyway--not kidding, there are 200 sets of '( )' in these directions.  It's no fun...break out the old maid.	-1
This toy is marketed as a baby toy but babies can't play with it.  It is too heavy and the legs are even too big for their mouth.  Granted, you can play songs for your baby and every once and a while your child might fall on one of the legs and trigger a note, but the legs are too big for small hands to squeeze and make "music".  Also smells like French vanilla.  We'll see when she gets older if she plays with it.	-1
I bought this for my grandson who likes tactile and interactive things. I liked the recommendations from professionals but we all found this terribly difficult and have not introduced it to my grandson since we didn't want to frustrate him!	-1
Returned this toy.  The ball bearing shot too far and with nothing to stop it was afraid it would break something. Game would be better enclosed.	-1
The moving parts of this toy are not put together very well so it does not work.  I am glad we tried it out before  my grandson saw it.  It saved him dissapointment.  Amason gave me a refund.	-1
At first it seems fine, plays as it should but after a few go's, the cheap construction starts to falter. The mechanism that swings both arms out at the back fails. I've unscrewed the base to try to fix but it doesn't help. Cheap Chinese construction doesn't work for this type of game. The 80's original lasted a lot longer!	-1
Impossible do correctly, not well made, kids gave up on it as the ball would just slip through cracks. lame	-1
This corral is more for paddock paks.  It is only up to the knee on most traditional models.  On classics it is only up to their barrel/shoulder.	-1
It is an okay game.  It doesn't have the letter I  !!!!	-1
This is not the original version. Its a knock off. It jammed the first several times we used it. Buy the ToysRus version instead.	-1
Very small	-1
Expected a bit bigger, better quality product, but this thing is kind of flimsy.	-1
Unfortunately the mouth does not stay open on the one that I received.  It would be perfect if the hinge was not defective.	-1
Love this game but the jaw broke within a few rounds of playing it	-1
I wish ours wouldn't have broke, I would give it 4-5 stars. But the mouth doesn't stay up. My daughter gets so sad and asks me to fix it every time she sees it.  When I can get the mouth up the game still doesn't work.	-1
Broke first time playing spend the money and buy the name brand. Name brand doesn't break.	-1
Piece of junk made of cheep plastic and falls apart constantly t's a game I have to constantly put it back together (falls apart every time the mouth chomps down ) not much fun. Poor quality!	-1
Purchased this game as a Christmas present. After playing a few times the game was already breaking (i.e. mouth wouldn't close once all the teeth were pushed). You can tell by looking at the toy that it was cheaply made and the box wasn't in great shape when we received it. Good news is Target has a better product for a cheaper price! So if you need to get a replacement, I would suggest going there.	-1
Bought this for a road trip with my kids but unfortunately it did not work when we received it, had to return it.	-1
Not like the original game. The teeth do not come out and it is very small. The top half of the mouth is constantly falling off.	-1
Very cheaply made. Had broken pieces of sharp plastic when it arrived in a smashed box. When the crocodile does snap it's teeth down it is hard and made my 3 year old cry. I tried it and it hurt my finger too. I do not recommend this product	-1
My 5 year old granddaughter was so excited to play with Crocodile Dentist. It broke after playing with it in the first day.	-1
Looked good at first, stopped working after 30 minutes. The "jaw" wouldn't lock in place. Would not stay open. Extremely disappointed.	-1
This was cheap crap. Broke after 2 times playing it. And it was tiny. Like 6 inches. So annoying. Don't waste your money.	-1
This item broke within a week. There were 3 children playing with it daily but, there's not much to the game. It may last longer with less activity.	-1
Item was broken when we got it in the mail.  The bottom and top pieces would not connect.  My 3 kids were very disappointed.	-1
I was disappointed by this game. It is NOT the full size version. At the time of ordering, this was not indicated in the description. It came from China, I believe. It was cheaply made and covered in a mysterious smelly white dust. I cleaned it off with a wipe before I gave it to the kids. They played with it a few times. When the mouth closes, it actually hurts your finger. Really. And, after a few times, the mouth will not even stay open to play with it. Disappointed.  UPDATE: After playing with it a couple dozen times, it no longer works. All the teeth can be pushed down without the alligator shutting its mouth.	-1
Mehh... this thing is so tiny and disappointing. I really expected it to be bigger. It's entertaining for a couple of minutes, but I'm not sure if it's worth the few bucks I paid.	-1
I'm only giving it 2 stars because of the color it's a lot smaller than its picture it had no box or instructions the upper jaw falls off of both that I buy and the other half of the time it will not stay locked into position so you can play the game cappy made came from China don't know if it's a knock off or just that bad.	-1
Lasted one day and now the mouth won't stay open.	-1
Came broken from China	-1
I was not expecting a Keychain toy..yes, it's a Keychain but I didn't attach the chain through the hole in the back end of the crocodile. I was totally disappointed because as you can see this was totally smaller than the item description even.	-1
Very small and doesn't work at all. Very cheaply made. Looks like a key chain. It doesn't look like the one on the picture. Mine was yellow.	-1
Bought for my 3-year-old for Christmas and disappointed in it. One of the teeth doesn't push down, it doesn't always snap down. It's also very small. I'm not impressed at all.	-1
I thought it was the big game. It's not.	-1
Broke within 10 minutes of opening it. I'd be interested in the real Hasbro version of this toy as suggested by another reviewer. My daughter had been asking me to buy this toy for weeks, and it broke immediately. How disappointing! I concur with other reviews that it also looked used right out of the box, but I think that's a matter of poor quality plastics used that are scratched and dull. It still might have its purpose as a travel toy, since the best travel toys can get thrown away before going back home.	-1
We had this for less the an hour and it broke. Just from playing with it normal, not rough or throwing.	-1
The catch and release in this game stopped working really quickly. Once the mouth shut it would not stay open.	-1
I think it only lasted a couple of months.	-1
If I could give 0 stars, I would.  It arrived weeks after it should have in a box that was completely destroyed (I know, not the manufacturer's fault).  But the toy itself is made with the cheapest material possible.  I am so glad I tried it out before giving to my nephews... It actually hurt when the jaw slammed shut!!  Needless to say, it went straight into the trash - I wouldn't even donate it for another kid!	-1
When I received it was damaged and not as described	-1
Terribly designed; we couldn't even make it through one game before it broke. Save your money and buy something of better quality instead.	-1
So many bad things to say about this that I don't feel like listing them.  To keep things short and sweet, it broke within 2 minutes of just testing it out.  VERY cheaply made.  Please, do not waste your money as I have.  I wanted this game for a party, and to bring back some fun funny childhood memories.  Instead I ended up just bringing pain and sorrow to my wallet.  BEWARE!!!!	-1
It doesn't snap closed. After very minimal usage it started sticking and now the jaw only closes when forced down. I used to love this toy, wish it was still well made.	-1
What a let down when my child got this as a gift and after opening and pressing down all the teeth it never chomped! Waste of money, the old version was way better.	-1
Seems cheaply made and much smaller than expected (about the size of an adult hand).  My kids played it for about 2 minutes.  A waste of money if you ask me.	-1
This is not even close to what I expected.  The game is tiny and very different from the version I had previously owned.  Very disappointed.	-1
The crocodile's mouth does not close at all on this game.  My sons still enjoy playing with it but the game does not work.  I am lucky my kid's have wonderful imaginations or I would be sending it back.	-1
I wouldn't buy another on of these, it didn't work when we got it and it didn't look like much fun even if it had worked, it's cheaply made and would have most likely broke shortly after it was bought.	-1
This started out as an entertaining toy, but after a few days the bad tooth stopped working and ended up being a disappointed purchase.	-1
Toy failed after 10 minutes of use. Mouth will not stay open to play intended game. Will send back and request refund.	-1
don't buy this, broke out of the box,poor quality item, dissapointed child,worst present ever,stay away from this game not worth the time or money	-1
i purchased this thinking it was the ORIGINAL crocodile dentist. this one is FAR FROM IT.  first of all, it is about the size of my hand. yes, very very very small. it does not take batteries.  you simply "push" the teeth down with your finger one at a time and when you press a certain tooth, it trigger the jaw to close on your finger.  but, the jaw is held open with just a spring attachement which often malfunctions.  and when the jaw closed on my sons little finger (only 3), the top part of the crocodile just fell off.  it is CHEAPLY MADE! the picture is also misleading - this one has braces. i do not remember the original crocodile dentist having braces on its top teeth.  completely bored my son.	-1
This isn't at all like the Milton Bradley version, it's VERY VERY cheap brittle plastic. Ours arrived with the top portion of the head warped and unable to stay attached to the body which makes the game useless. But the overall plastic is cheap, there are stress marks all over the  plastic that were not caused by us and unlikely caused by shipping.. This is what I would expect at a dollar discount store or flea market where you expect it to either not work, or only work a few times before breaking.	-1
I'm very upset after receiving my "Crocodile Dentist" game.  Once I got it out of the Amazon box, I realized right away that this was not the game made by Hasbro sold in the US.  It's very obvious just from looking at the game box, which is cheap, says "CrocoDileDentist" on it, and is full of oddly-phrased sentences with typos, punctuation errors, and grammer mistakes.  The toy does work, but it is VERY cheaply made.  If I wanted this toy, I could have gone to alibaba.com and ordered one from China myself for 1.75.  Instead I paid 11 dollars for the REAL toy, and got this one.  As another reviewer said, it does have a "used" look about it right out of the package.  Especially on the bottom of the toy.  I am very disapointed.  I've never had an experience like this on Amazon, and I've bought hundreds of items.  This seller gives this sitea bad name.	-1
Cute idea, but toy is cheaply made and doesn't work most of the time. Not worth it, save your money.	-1
My oldest got this for his 5th birthday. He and his 3yo brother played with it non-stop! It was a huge hit. But now here we are just a week later and the crocodile won't keep his mouth open :( The kids still play with it, but of course not nearly as much. They just hold his mouth open and push all the teeth down, then ignore it for the most part. Part of me wants to buy another, but I'm worried about it just breaking again.	-1
the title says it all. My 2.5 yr old son was not that interested in the first place, completely stopped playing with it after 30 minutes. It now sits with a pile of toys collecting dust.	-1
My four-year-old loves playing Go Fish over and over since getting these cards.  Unfortunately the cards are pretty thin and she bends them very easily.  Plus the cards in the Crazy Eights pack are all directions - there are no actual game cards in the pack so we can't play that one at all.	-1
My daugther received this for her 1st birthday.  I thought it would have been an instant hit considering that she absolutely loves music. This toy does not hold her interest at all.  The only thing she seems to do is pull the animals out of their holders and throws them around (and that is really noisy - especially on our wooden floorboards!.  The music is really pretty - very easy to listen to as a parent but the idea of her taking animals in and out to make different sounds seems a bit difficult for her as she doesn't have any interest in doing it at all. My 2.5 year old also shows no interest in this toy. It's a big of a disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it.  There are loads of other musical toys on the market that I would have bought over this one.	-1
The idea behind the toy is nice however I am really disappointed with the quality of product. The plastic feels cheap and also the amount of effort needed to open the toy is not consistent. Some need no effort and some need a really hard push.	-1
Poorly made.	-1
Bought too quickly.. there are very similar toys for almost half the price.. I thought it had to do something extra.. it opens and closes..	-1
this toy seems on the cheap side and came wrapped in package squished in a plain brown cardboard box. My 1.5 year old nice, liked it okay, but it is  not something I would order again.	-1
Poorly made	-1
I remember playing with this toy in the church nursery as a little one, and how much fun it was. I couldn't wait to get it for my little girl. It is a nice looking toy and the "characters' are all cute. However, the opening mechanisms are so stiff and cheaply made, that my daughter can only get the simple button one open. She is 19 months old and has very good fine motor skills. As a child, I remember the opening mechanisms being very easy and smooth! That is how it should be. Especially for the $20 I paid.  She gets very upset and frustrated because she can't get any of these open. I am sure by the time she is 3 or so she will have no problem getting these open, but by that age, she won't care about popping these open. My advice would be to find a classic one at a garage sale.	-1
Like a previous reviewer said, adult strength is required to manipulate half of these buttons. My (strong) 16-month-old doesn't enjoy playing with it at all because I have to help her out with most of them. Not worth the money for a toy that provides little to no entertainment. The toy also arrived in a shipping box without the original packaging.	-1
Eh, it was cheap, was a lightening deal, but my son didn't like it much at 6 months old and still doesn't at 13 months....	-1
The things always get stuck. I will even have a hard time opening them sometimes because they stick. It was like this right out id the box. The toddler we watch would get so frustrated with it, we ended up just putting it in storage hoping they might like it when they are older.	-1
Been better	-1
Not like when we were kids : ( outsourcing manufacturing strikes again in the reduced quality of a once beloved toy.	-1
I will give my review after christmas	-1
I just don't like the system and I was afraid my baby was going to get her little fingers stuck. Some of them were too plain and the other too challenging, not good at all.	-1
[...]  If you go to the Hasbro website, you'll notice this item was recalled.  That is why the price is so high (it is not being sold directly through Amazon).  You can't get the toy in stores anymore.  My son did enjoy playing with it and I wish that Playskool would remake the toy in a safer version.  Unfortunate.	-1
I remember playing with these toys as a child and thought it would be fun for my daughter as well. The reason I gave it a low rating is that it does not make any sounds. I almost thought it was broken and was looking for a battery area when I realized there is no sounds and all the toy does is pop up quietly. I remember the Sesame Street version and each character said a little saying when it popped up and this toy does not do that.	-1
Our kid likes to play with this, so on the toy front it is great for enjoyment.  The issue comes when you look at what it is made from and Playskool's policy on chemical inclusions on products (aka if it isn't illegal/banned it is fine and we'll include it)  They won't say it doesn't include BPA/phthalates/etc. and imply it likely does.  We returned this based on this as we try and keep the little guys exposure to a minimum.	-1
basic toy that has been around since probably my mother was small. last for maybe a few months till their sick of it and it ends up in the toy pile.	-1
It seems that someone is going around and down-voting all of the negative reviews of this product, no matter how clearly written or factual. If you read through them, though, you will see the same opinions expressed again and again:  First, the Amazon price is way too high. You can find this toy in most big box retailers for around $12-15.  Second, the buttons are very stiff and hard for young toddlers to use.  This was our experience too. Our baby liked seeing the animals pop up, and she figured out how each lever or knob or button was supposed to work; she just wasn't strong enough to make it happen. You really have to have some strong fingers to use this toy.  Since doing the right thing doesn't work, the educational value is nil. Baby can only play with it if we help her push the buttons, which defeats the whole point of exploring and playing.	-1
$28.99 The week before XMas ?!!! Crazy ! I found it for $13 (and not even in sale) at my local Target. I will update my review on the toy itself after XMas and when my son will have gotten some time to play with it.	-1
My daughter LOVES this toy.  However the buttons are so diffcult to move that it frustrates her.  I don't know of any baby strong enough to push the buttons.  It needs to be easier for a baby to use.  My daughter is constantly asking me to "help" her push the buttons and wants to be able to push them herself.	-1
This toy is like one I had as a child which is what made me buy it to begin with.  I like toys like this but this particular model is defective.  The key that you have to turn to make the middle animal pop up is messed up on these.  You can't close the lid again until you fiddle with the key and get it in the exact right position.  It is tricky and little kids can't get the hang of it.  This really upsets my daughter so I through this away.  It wasn't just mine either.  I have seen others that do it and read about it on other reviews.	-1
We bought this for our son's 1st Birthday. He's quite the energetic guy so this really did little for him. At first he was curious how it worked and then lost all interest quickly after. Not a big loss though as it was cheap.	-1
Bought this game for my granddaughter when she was 4.  She is now 6, and hasn't played it very much during these two years.  It's very simple - just matching colors and making a various snakes.  That's about it.  I've purchased two or three other games from the Gamewright people, and I won't be buying any more.	-1
These are small wooden, just plane checkers.	-1
They do not stack - at all.  I can lay one on top of the other,  but a slight nudge will knock it off.  Why would anyone make checkers that don't stack? They are almost worthless.	-1
Awesome size for three kids (or more) and holds SO much water but ours sprung a leak on the third use. Somewhere along the seam so the patch included will not work. Kids were very disappointed to say the least.	-1
Got too many little holes in it after just a few uses.  I found it very difficult to fill because I could never get the bottom stretched and flat enough and the sides buldged out at the bottoms.	-1
Got pool in and went to set it up within an hour of getting it and it leaked from the first time trying to fill it up.  Kids could not even use it and were so disappointed and sad.  This was their first pool at age 5 and 4.  They have been asking all summer so far to get one.  Once we finally were able to it was devastating.  Their summer fun was ruined by a new product that they could not use.  Will never buy again and DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!	-1
Got a hole in less than 2 months. also not a great pool for littles who need help using the edge of the pool to slide out, which I didn't think about when we bought this. We bought a blow up one after this got a hole. It's been much better for us because they can slide in and out without collapsing the pool sides or letter water out.	-1
The pool came with a cracked side so it wouldn't hold any water.  Had a lot of VERY disappointed kids at a birthday party!	-1
This is a terrible pool.  It does not hold its shape, and the sides are floppy.  Do not waste your money.	-1
Got it out of the box and started filling up only to find a hole in the pool.	-1
If you don't have completely level ground, look elsewhere!	-1
Super floppy. After set up it looked nothing like the photo. However, I set up on a slight slope. It looked flat, but upon filling the water all slopped to one side and collapsed the pool. Maybe on perfectly flat concrete, this would work. Still, the kids enjoyed splashing around for a while. I actually bought this for our ducks, but the sides are so flimsy, I can't set up ramps. There is already a small hole on the bottom caused by sharp grass. I consider this a one-time use item.	-1
Gave it for a birthday gift. Found out there is a tear at the seam of the pool slow leak	-1
Pain to fill, does not stand upright, falls in on all sides	-1
I didn't like it. It was bigger than I expected and was awkward to set up. It got a crack in the plastic and I didn't even try to fix it or return it. I just ate $18.  I'll never buy anything else but a hard plastic kiddie pool from now on.	-1
Arrived with a 5 inch crack in the side. We didn't notice until we started to fill it and water was pouring out the side. Disappointed kiddos.	-1
This pool is a nice size for my kids but within days the entire top rim caved in from the sun which limits about 2 feet of water that could be in there. After a few days its so dirty from sand and its impossible to clean without emptying 150 gallons of water from it. And within 2 months it now has holes everywhere in it. Its a cool pool for about a month. Every month we just buy a new one amd keep replacing them.	-1
Terrible quality.  I couldn't get the sides to stay up even after propping it!	-1
flimsy	-1
Did not hold up well	-1
Leaked	-1
The side split as it was filling.  No repair patch in package as promised.  Left my 5 year old who was super excited about being able to use the pool sobbing with disappointment.	-1
What a pain to fill...the walls stand up when the water is filled to the top, but when first filling it all the walls are trying to cave in and the water pours out one side while you are trying to hold up the other so it isn't easy to fill with just one adult/person. I wasn't comfortable filling it all the way to the top so the walls do not fully stand up all the way and I don't see any possible way to get the bottom fully expanded to be a full circle. Oh well. It's worth it for 30 bucks i guess. You use it a couple of days until the water is nasty and then dump it and clean it and then fill it again a few days later...kind of a waste of water so I try to use the old water to water the garden and other plants.  UPDATE*** This lasted a month of use, and when I didn't use it I cleaned it out, folded and rolled it up and stored it inside my house in a closet. Brought it back out, and the walls were so brittle they cracked and now it's useless.	-1
This pool is flimsy, hard to set up and IT LEAKS!  My kids used it for one afternoon (gently, according to instructions) and the next morning there was a large hole and the water had drained halfway.  Definitely not a product I would recommend!	-1
Came with a hole. Getting a replacement.	-1
sides tilt and easy for water to leak out	-1
very hard to get sides to stay up!!	-1
I loved it online, but it came faukty. had a hole or something wasn't taking air	-1
Great size, but when we put it up and filled with water it leaked at the seam. Very dissapointing. Am exchanging for the same thing so hopefully this one was just a fluke.	-1
Need 3 adults to set this thing up!!	-1
There are multiple shapes part like oval and triangle, instead of also making them multiple colors so that they match the animal color is just poor thinking or cost cutting. I didn't like it. Sorry.	-1
Good for 2 or 3 fills and then the walls start to collapse inward and outward.  Doesn't hold it's shape.	-1
Did not play with this for long.  Pieces got lost very fast.  Gave it away to someone else. Didn't get any use of this	-1
PASS! Do not buy this!!! Unless you live in the Great Plains... If there is the slightest tilt, this pool collapses. Buy something else	-1
Colossal pain in the a** to set up. The walls never straightened out, it cracked when I tried to. I set it up once for my dogs and when it got dirty, I threw it away.	-1
I don't like writing negative reviews, and I have a lot of Melissa and Doug products that I think are great. But right out of the box the paint was peeling off all the puzzles, and worst of all they had an overpowering, terrible odor that made my head ache. I don't want my children, or anyone else, inhaling that odor on a regular basis. I love the idea of this toy and would have kept it even with the chipped paint, but I couldn't get past how badly it smelled, and returned it. Perhaps the odor might dissipate over time but that's not very comforting to me. Really disappointing. I will say I have not had this happen with other Melissa and Doug products, maybe this was just a bad batch.	-1
I was very disappointed in this doll.  Does not have much going for it and highly overpriced.  She still hasn't been taken out of the box.	-1
As soon as I took off the plastic wrap I inhaled the strongest smell of VOC's. I knew this product was made in China before I even looked at the back of the box. This company should be ashamed of themselves. On one hand they promote toys that enhance learning but at the cost of the health of a child that could impair long-term learning. Babies and toddlers have soft scalps and are more affected by toxins then adults. I called customer service thinking that this may be an isolated incident. However, the rep nonchalantly told me to air out the toys for a few days first. I told her that isn't acceptable. My child will touch this toy and my infant has put the toy in her mouth. Melissa and Doug doesn't care about our kids as much as they care about turning a profit.	-1
My 20 month old put these puzzles together 6 times and has never looked at them again. I liked the idea that the puzzles had two sides, and the awesome quality of the product. It just wasn't a good investment for me.	-1
I set this pool up for my 2 kids (4 and9) and they played in it for an hour or so. The next day they went to play in it and the sides had melted in the sun. I have never seen anything like it!	-1
This pool broke the first time we used it. It's hard to fill up and keep the sides level. We had four people trying to help, but it still didn't work. The weight of the water on one side caused it to collapse and it tore, and we were on level ground.	-1
My one son wanted a pool for a while and when he woke up he looked outside to a surprise and seen a half full pool (I filled it very early in am) we thought maybe the side collapsed & let some  water out. He waited in anticipation for two hours. To a four-year old that's an eternity. Before he even got in he found a leak. Right at the sidewall (Rigid PVC) and where the liner meet. We were greeted with a Two inch Slit!!! Well an 8' diameter pool should not be stuffed in a 5"square x 20" tall box. Since the FACTORY, not Amazon packed it so tight the rigid PVC was past it's bendable state in a hard crease making it brittle. The pool also required baby sitting it for at least an hour when filling to support the sides and keep the liner from creating creases, to avoid tears! Meanwhile I set this pool up in a Perfectly level surface with thick Gym Mats underneath to provide a smooth base. So that's what happens when you take extra measures to setup a nice pool. You get a slit in the side!	-1
The pool walls didn't stand straight as pictured. I couldn't fill the tub, and I had to return it. Intex snap pools are not made well and they all leak.  Buyers be aware.	-1
I bought this to put on my patio for my younger grandchildren.  Your surface must be perfectly level for this pool..the sides are very flimsy and it takes three to five people to support them until the pool is full,  If you have any slant to the ground at all, the water goes to that side and will collapse the side of the pool.  I threw it away and  bought a blow up pool, which works much better.  I definitely would not recommend this product.	-1
I got this for the grand kids and while its a great size for three kids,  I don't think it will last the summer. It's extremely tiresome to fill and drain, hard to clean out and easy to bend the walls in the wrong places. What happened to the good old fashioned, affordable hard plastic pools? Sigh.	-1
Hard to fill, the sides are weak and It does not keep its shape well. Next year we will be going with a hard plastic pool or inflatable again.	-1
The scorching sun 95C melted the plastic. It won't stay up. Only got 1 day use out of this. Would not recommend this product.	-1
It busted as I was walking to the pool with it...piece of junk	-1
Okay, I'm not your typical homeowner. I don't have a lick of grass. We bought this for my daughter last year. And it was nice for about two weeks.  The sides just won't stay up. The wind would knock one side down and it would start draining. The bottom is super flimsy. And we couldn't keep up with the slime that started growing on it, even with a shot or two of chlorine bleach thrown in.  Then it sprung a teeny leak -- dogs or the sand underneath, I don't know.  It was big enough for me to sit in.  This year we bought a small hard plastic pool.	-1
Beautiful float, but kept deflating from the day I got it. I can't get it to stay inflated!	-1
Worked great (for about 1 month) until the arm rest ripped a hole in the bottom - can't be replaced with the patch provided.	-1
Not a good product. Very cheaply made.	-1
Bought it as a gift for my nephew for our vacation. The mattress broke after 2nd swim in the pool. No adults used it, only 11 year old boy. The quality is poor.	-1
Okay design and fit. Not the greatest. Definitely not for anyone who weighs more than 80lbs soaking wet.	-1
The lunge itself is pretty cool, big enough for adults, and my kids love them.  But they've got wholes and lose air from almost first use. I ordered a few of them, and they were all like that. I guess you can't expect more for the price.  Very poor quality.	-1
Busted on first use. The seams are not made well.	-1
This would have been a great product except for the fact that it arrived with a leak in it. I should have just returned it right away.	-1
HAD KINF KOOLS FOR YEARS AND YEARS ..ALWAYS VERY ROOMY..THESE WERE SO SMALL AND NOT AS NICELY MADE. THEY TOOK A GREAT RAFT AND RUINED THEM :( WE'RE USING THEM BUT NOT AT ALL COMFY LIKE THE OKLD ONES WERE.	-1
As previously previewed, these last for a few days to weeks, but then will spring a leak and leave you bobbing in the pool like a apple at a state fair bobbing contest. One lasted several weeks, but eventually, it too sprang a leak. But they are good while they last....which sounds a lot like my second marriage, but that's another story.	-1
I made sure to check the size for this before I bought it and at 63 inches (I'm 64 inches) I figured it'd be perfect (esp while sitting up).  It is NOT 63 inches.  I measured it right before completing this review and it's 55 inches only.  So, yes, I can fit on it while sitting but my legs have to be bent.  It also claims to be 33.5 inches wide and just now measuring it's about 27 inches (when inflated).  The cup holder is completely non-functional.  It's low to the water (when you're in it) and it fills with water, so there really is no point.  That said, I didn't buy it because it had a cup holder, I just wanted something I could relax in.  That it does.  It's so far been sturdy and I let my 4 yr old play on it and don't worry that she'll fall out (unless flipped by another child).  Hope this helps anyone out there who's taller than I!	-1
I"m going to make this very brief....  You have to actually drill the holes directly into the seat itself!  So what happens when you don't need the belt anymore?  You have a bike that looks ridiculous with huge holes in the seat...  Not well thought out..	-1
I purchased this seatbelt/harness for use on my son's kettrike tricycle. It's design is functional but unfortunately, a little too simple.  Instead of having a clasp on the center belt (the one that comes up from the center/bottom of the seat) into which the individual horizontal belts could connect to, the center belt has a loop in the end that you must thread the horizontal belts through.  When Jr. wants to ride his fancy new tricycle and your still fumbling with the harness, things can get ugly.  Lastly, this belt is made in China unlike the tricylce itself which was also dissapointing.	-1
Very expensive For a whole bunch of sand All other pieces are very small and I will replace with others	-1
I hate this toy, which is a shame because both my 17 month old boy and almost 3 year old girl loves it. The little head on the mower chomps very, very noisily when pushed. To fix the noise issue, simply removing the batteries does nothing. We were gifted this by the grandparents for Christmas, along with the playskool vacuum which we love and isn't terribly loud. While they were playing with the lawn mower, we was unable to hear or communicate easily with the grandparents on our web cam because of the noise level. You cannot keep this toy out if you have a napping small child and a playing older child. You cannot talk on the phone, have a conversation with someone in the same room, or sleep if someone is playing with this toy. Bad for migraine sufferers. Terrible for pets/kids with fear of loud noises.  Great if you keep it outdoors and your neighbors don't mind.	-1
My mother in law got this for our daughter's first birthday.  Daddy's name is Mike so she thought this was just the cutest thing because of the name.  Well he lived in our closet for a week before being returned!  It scared the poop out of her!  It would start talking for no reason and the eyes would move around.  We honestly thought it was possessed.  My husband got it out to check it out to see if he could figure out what was wrong with it and get her to play with it.  Well she finally would push it around but she kept going back to her Dusty (the vacuum) and leaving daddy to play with the mower.  They had been playing about three phrases worth when the thing burped!  Then I started to listen to it!  It says some of the grossest and rudest things I have ever heard come out of a toy!  We hated to be rude to grandma but we told her Mike the mower was going back tot he store!  We bought the original Mike the Mower for my cousin's youngest child a few years back.  He was much more polite and cute!  So until the old Mike is back there's only room for one Mike in our family and that is daddy!	-1
Not much compared to the screen's Screen inside the case and confirmed cases andoegin well, but They're not that great customized bonikka case It looks like cheap stuff. Easily fall inside the case to hold the pencil and absurd. If you live in the United States, have been returned goods.	-1
I bought this to help my son organize art supplies, but it cannot even fit all of the supplies it comes with.  The markers are very difficult to get in, and there are not enough spaces for all of them.  We just took the art supplies and trashed the case.	-1
Received as a gift.  It was difficult to put the pencils/crayons in their slots and seems like it will be a pain for my 5 yr old to remove them to do her artwork.  It's cheap plastic.  Waste of money.	-1
It should be the "ultimate kit" .. well it's not .. the case is junky, the pencils fall apart and are to lil .. there isn't much to any of the supplies .. you can spend four dollars in rose art supplies and get this much and better quality .. because this doesn't even seem like crayola quality ..	-1
This box is the bane of my existence.  Because it's her "art box" my daughter won't let me throw it out, yet every time it's opened the plastic holder and all the supplies fall out. Plus, it's 10 times the size it needs to be for the stuff that's actually in it.    The cheap plastic supplies holders don't hold all the supplies correctly and fall out. The markers fall out everytime it's opened..  If you find this box super cheap than I would rec'd getting it to replenish marker sets and things you already have.  But it's  not a good gift as an art supply box.	-1
I am also VERY disappointed in this case!!!  My son excitedly picked this out and I thought it would be PERFECT for him to keep all his supplies together and he would be able to carry it out to use any time.  Well, like everyone else has already said....the parts inside that hold all the crayons, pencils, etc, do not attach to the actual red case so every time we open and close the case everything falls out.  It's so frustrating to my son that he doesn't use it anymore or just trashes it.  SOooooooo mad that Crayola couldn't at least have attached the pieces together so they wouldn't fall out.	-1
What a great idea!  A toy that babies can get creative with and not get messy!  If only it worked ... The surface is blue "goop" but enclosed in a strong plastic film so as you "fingerpaint" on the "goop" you aren't getting any on your fingers.  As the the "goop" is moved aside by your fingers bright colours are revealed behind to make your work of art even more colourful.  There are stampers as well to make shapes.  To clear the screen you simply move the bar up and down (like a Magna Doodle) and start over.  And to make it even more fun when you press down on the screen music plays.  There is a stand as well - making it easy for sitting babies to draw. Unfortunately the toy did not live up to our expectations.  You must press quite firmly on the "goop" screen to make an a good impression and to get the music to play.  My daughter was never able to press hard enough to make the music work. And when any sort of pressure was applied the stand would collapse.  The stampers just kind of make a blob in the "goop"  and not a nice clear image as you would expect.  To clear the screen you must move the bar up and down at least 5 - 10 times to make a clear surface.  My daughter had no interest in it at all. This toy is disappointing and I wouldn't recommend it.  Try a Magna Doodle when your baby is a bit older - now that is a great creative toy that works!	-1
It is very difficult for a toddler to put enough pressure on the pad to create an image.  If you are lucky enough to create an image,it disappears immediately.  My toddler never wanted to play with this toy.	-1
I was very excited about this toy, thinking it was an excellent idea. Unfortunately, it hasn't really lived up to its price tag. The screen is way, way, way too hard for my 15 month old to make impressions on. I can draw on it; my 8-year-old son can draw on it, as well, but he has to be careful not to use his fingernails. The baby, though, for whom it was bought, can't make marks without a concentrated, sustained "push", and he's a pretty rough little boy! He does enjoy pulling out/replacing the little shapes on the bottom, and he does enjoy pushing the musical note on the side to make music play. He also enjoys sitting/standing/running in place on it to make music (this is a VERY durable toy!). It isn't used to draw, though, which is a shame. I'm glad some families have gotten good use out of theirs, but I, personally, would have to tell anyone who asked to save their money for a more toddler-friendly toy. (Side note: My toy doesn't have the easel on the back, either, although it does have the hollowed-out, shaped space for one. Maybe they've stopped including it?)	-1
In theory this toy works -- in  reality it stinks!  Fisher Price is known for interesting, good quality toys for kids, so buying this for our one year old's birthday was a no-brainer for me and my husband.  Upon opening the box, the toy already had a "sketch" on it, faded color spots in one corner and would not wipe clean to start a new drawing no matter how hard we pressed the clear bar.  This toy reminded us of the old time carbon wipe off boards (remember those from the 5 & dime store?) where you scratched designs with a plastic stick and then ripped up the top plastic sheet to clear the slate and start again.  Well those cheap originals worked better than this Musical Fingerpaint toy!  Not even the music was clear, in fact it worked only some of the time, and the surface was so tough that you'd have to press down with a solid object alot stronger than a toddler's finger in order to make a design.  Then once you do manage to draw something, it is virtually impossible to clear it to start over.  Needless to say, we returned it promptly and bought something more practical, a Baby Leap Pal, and our daughter loves it.  Sorry, Fisher Price, you get an "F" for this one.	-1
My daughter received this as a present when she was a year old and only played with it a few times.  She liked the music though and would press the musical note on the side to here the music. Its to hard for a one year old to press on and make an impression even using the tools that came with it. My 4 year old can paint on it though.	-1
I just bought this for my younger son for his first birthday. The package says for 9 mos +. We have had it less than a week and have problems. First, the music actually made my son upset when he touched it so I had to shut it off. Also, the soft cover needs alot of pressure for the colors to be seen. Even the plastic shapes that come with the toy don't work unless I press hard and twist them a little. This is definitely not for an infant. The picture on the package is very misleading. As others have noted, the stand is not very sturdy at all. In fact my son tried to use the toy to lean on and stand himself up. My 3-year old actually was able to remove part of the stand from the holder. I should have left the toy in it's box to see if my younger son would even play with it. That way I could have returned it.	-1
This is the worst toy.  Completely worthless.  It is bulky and takes up room and is not fun at all.  You have to press too hard to make a picture and it's impossible to "fingerpaint" because it does not stay pressed in where you push it.  It makes loud obnoxious music.  YOu are better off getting a box of crayons and some plain paper and drawing pictures with your child.	-1
screws are hard to get together	-1
Not that fun.  I wish it had more nails and was easier for a toddler to use.  Even for me the hammer does not pull out the nails and I just kinda stare at the pcs like what the hell do I do with this? Maybe when he gets older? I love Melissa and Doug toys but this was sort of a bummer.	-1
Tools from China....are exactly what you'd expect. Cheap.	-1
It's ok. My 20month old like the hammer but not the screws	-1
I was given this tool kit as a Christmas gift for my 2-3/4 year old grandson.  He was very excited to use it as he's interested in tools.  He can hammer the nails into the tool chest but that's all.  The claw on the hammer does not fit any of the pieces and the nails must be removed by hand.  My grandson is not strong enough to push the nails out by himself.  The screws are so long that it takes a super long time to screw them in far enough to get a nut to fit. It's much easier to use your hands than the screwdriver or wrench.  I don't think any child would have that much patience.  My husband said he'd cut the screws in half to make it a better design but he thought the whole thing was done badly:  too much dexterity required for a 2 or 3 year old and not interesting enough for an older child.  I have several Melissa and Doug toys and this is the first one that's really disappointing.  I'm surprised at the positive reviews.	-1
My daughter won't touch this. She just doesn't like it. And I can see why. It doesn't make sense. There are a bunch of parts that don't screw into anything or anywhere. It is just a bunch of pieces that look like they might be functional. I have no idea why this is rated so high. I would definitely not buy again.	-1
The back of the hammer, normally used for pulling up nails, is narrower than the width of the pegs, so you can't actually use it to pull them out... The threading on the bolts is too fine and long, making it take about 9000 rotations to unscrew anything, which is beyond the patience of a three year old. Since the holes on the tool chest are not threaded, the only thing you can screw the bolts into are the nuts, which requires simultaneously using the wrench and screw driver, which is a bit beyond the coordination of a three year old. In the end, it is far easier to fasten / unfasten the nuts and bolts with your hands, rendering the tools useless for anything except adding frustration to the task.	-1
poor execution, M&D. Their toys are not as good as they used to be. These nuts and bolts do not thread and are not compatible with the separate construction set.	-1
Good idea, but the drum broke after one week use. The quality could be improved	-1
Does not keep my 22 month old entertained.  Can't get the concept of screwing things together yet	-1
Daughter was interested in this for a little bit and a little every once in awhile but not much.	-1
I'm a huge Melissa and Doug fan, and we have everything from their play kitchen to their dress up stuff and in between, but i am not a fan of the percussion set! The symbols really don't work, and neither does the hand-held clapper (unless as adult moves it extremely fast with force). The maracas are okay and the only thing worthwhile was the tambourine. The wooden instrument with ribbing does not even work (the ribbing is so light that it will not even make the sound it's supposed to when trying to slide across it). Overall, not impressed! It might be worth noting that my husband and I are musicians, so we were looking for something much more realistic that the kids could play and actually make music with (but durable as well) and we will be trying something else in the future. I would recommend spending a little more money on something else and buying some better quality instruments separately.	-1
Poor design and quality. I think there could be so much more done with it to make it better. expectations not met.	-1
This toy looks cute and the reviews raved about how much fun 2 year olds had playing with it.  There are two pegs to hammer into the side holes, and that was fun for a few minutes for my grandson.  The wooden hammer really doesn't look much like a hammer.  There are many screws and nuts and wooden strips with holes, but there is really nothing you can make with them.  So unless your child enjoys sitting and screwing nuts on pegs, I wouldn't waste my money on this product.	-1
Most of the instruments don't make much noise, and the cymbals have started rusting.	-1
We received this as a reward through a diapers program, and it was great to get it for "free".  However, I don't think I would pay more than $10.00 for this if I were purchasing it myself.  As another reviewer mentioned, it isn't a very useful or functional tool box.  In fact, the only thing that my 2 year old likes about it anymore is the hammer and screwdriver, and she doesn't even use them with the nails and screws that came with the kit.  The good things about the toy are its construction (solid wood) and its bright colors.  Also, one of the nuts wouldn't thread onto the bolt, so we had to throw the bolt away.  Once again, not a big deal, but only because it was "free".	-1
We received two toolboxes as a gift. One was full of well-designed, rather elegant wooden tools, which we received on my son's first birthday, and he has loved ever since; And this one, which he got today for his second birthday. This one is a very disappointing, ham-fisted splinterfest.  I like the carrying box, which gives them something to build on, but itself is very limited. The screws started breaking down as i removed the washers for the VERY FIRST TIME, creating splintered ends and getting wood in the carpet! When I looked inside, the holes in the box were absolutely unfinished, with large splinters sticking right off many of them! The hammer is a cartoon of a hammer, and can't be used to remove the plugs you hammer into the box because the back is too thick! The wrench is the wrong shape, so it is wide but barely works, and doesn't teach a child anything. And it is VERY limited in tools. Our other set came with a socket side to the wrench, a saw, a Phillips and a standard screwdriver both of which my 1.8 month old could use!! The screwdriver in this set is so fat that it is hard to use. These kids have little hands! My son is the size of a three-year-old at age 2, and his hands barely wrap around that screwdriver.  There are much better wooden tool sets out there, I would skip this one. Melissa and Doug quality seems to have gone way down, and this is yet another example. The other one we got was from "Classic World." They are utterly unmixable because the Melissa and Doug set is made with such big ungainly parts.	-1
I was excited when we received this toy as a gift -- I think M&D products in general are pretty neat. But about 10 minutes after my son started playing with it, he burst into tears as he had gotten a huge splinter in his finger. I took a closer look, and it is quite obvious that when the holes were drilled in the tool box, they were drilled too fast -- the inside of each hole was broken out like it had been punched through, and there were up to 1/8 inch slivers of wood that could easily break off of the product. The wooden bolts also have some drill issues -- the paint is chipped around the holes (it was clearly drilled after painting). Even the inside of the wooden flat pieces to hammer or screw through are somewhat rough. All in all, disappointing craftmanship on what seemed like a nice product at first.	-1
The Melissa & Doug Wooden Take Along Tool Kit (24pc) is another disappointment for this grandma.  Having our first grandchild allowed my husband and I to, once again, indulge in toy purchasing.  We had heard good things about Melissa & Doug products, so when I received an e-mail about a half-price sale, I asked my daughter which items she would like to have for her son.  Because his Papa is a woodworker and all-around handyman, she thought our grandson would enjoy having his own toolkit.  We had high hopes that the Melissa & Doug Wooden Take Along Tool Kit (24pc) would become a favorite toy.  Unfortunately, we had to take this away from our grandson shortly after giving it to him.  The product is made in China and the wood used in its construction is a cheap and results in potentially harmful products.  The threading of the screws caused firring so that little ones who might be inclined to test-taste their toys could, potentially, get splinters in their mouth.  I did not like the fact that the paint used on the Melissa & Doug Wooden Take Along Tool Kit (24pc) comes off easily when a child chews, even slightly, on the pieces.  Several articles discussing recalls of these products in Canada convinced me that Melissa & Doug toys needed to be removed from our future-purchase list.  The tight fit of the nails and screws on the toy we received proved to discourage our grandson from playing with the Melissa & Doug Wooden Take Along Tool Kit (24pc).  Further, the less-than-realistic shapes of the tools and assorted other items did nothing to attract our grandson's interest.  He wanted tools like Papa's.  We purchased the Fisher-Price Drillin' Action Tool Set when we saw it, and it was a real hit.  That toy definitely is worth your purchase.  I would not recommend purchasing the Melissa & Doug Wooden Take Along Tool Kit (24pc).  There are far better toolbox-type toys on the market.	-1
Ok	-1
This tool box has way too many 'pieces' and not enough tools.  And the tools are not very realistic either (more of a mallet than a hammer).  The wood has splintered and the paint is chipping off too.  The screws are untouchable, and we have had to throw a lot of them away because the splinters are so bad after having been threaded a few times in the holes.  Not at all impressed with this tool kit.  The Green Toys tool box is leaps and bounds better than this one.  Not only is it made from recycled material with no chemicals, but the tools look and work like real tools.  We have had both tool boxes for over a year, and my son uses the Green Toys one nearly every day, but barely touches this Melissa & Doug one.	-1
I bought this for my grandson when he was about 2 1/2.  I has been a total disappointment, even at age 3.  Nails & hammer:  At first, he really enjoyed hammering in the 2 nails into the holes in the side of the toolbox. But an strong adult needs to pull the nails out.  I can't do it. He really hammers hard!  Hammering the nails is the only part of the toy that he liked, but he lost interest.  Even at 3 yr. - I can't get him to play with it.  Screws, washers, screwdriver & wrench: The holes in the side of the toolbox are TOO BIG for the screws.  The 6 screws are over 2" long and there are washers that can be screwed on.  However, it is so much easier to use your fingers to fasten the washers, so the screwdriver isn't needed. And it is useless to try to use the wrench to unfasten them.  *** A toddler cannot use the screwdriver while holding the washer in place all by himself. He doesn't have enough hands.  I called Melissa & Doug, thinking I wasn't teaching him how to use the toy correctly.  The rep. said we should connect the brackets with the screws to make interesting designs or - I'm not sure what.  But I did try to show him.  No Fun!	-1
These are toys and any child will be very frustrated trying to get any decent sound out this imitation of musical instruments. They are a dissapoinment and are only good as decorations, they all fall short one way or another.	-1
Drum is good, symbols are a bit too small and sturdy to really make a decent sound, kid loves them none the less. The maracas seemed legit until the putty covering the bead hole started to break open. Triangle is good. This company really isn't worth it. Build your own box. I bought another larger set of theirs to have all instruments a child should have and out of all of the 20+ items only 2 where decent.	-1
Dissapointed... the maracas are very quiet. The symbols are two small to make a pleasant sound. Everything else is alright but nothing to write home about.	-1
I bought this for my 2 year old.  I was envisioning her walking around the house making all matter of joyful noise.  Not so much.  The maracas would make more noise if they were run over by a tire.  Seriously, you can hardly hear them.  The cymbals are really little and the tambourine doesn't have much sound either unless you are holding it in the throes of a seizure.  Fortunately, no seizures in this house and these are toys ended up packed away.	-1
We received this item as a gift several weeks ago, and these are my comments: - The drum/tambourine has not been sanded - there are a lot of splinters around the hole for your child's hand. - The maracas are way too big and make hardly any noise. The ends of the handles have not been sanded or sealed and have exposed splinters of wood. Also, the paint is uneven - barely there in some spots, chunky in other spots. - The cymbals are almost impossible for small hands to control enough to make a noise - and the noise produced is not a cymbal sound, just the sound of 2 pieces of metal clanking together. - The wooden clacker has the same problem with the paint as the maracas. - The wood percussives are also not well finished and don't make sound that anyone could consider to be musical. - We haven't used the triangle as it appears to be not particularly child-friendly. - The box is unfinished and has exposed splinters - we have had to replace it with our own box as this is not safe for children. Overall, this set it pretty disappointing. The items make noise, but it would be hard to call any of the noise musical in nature. We had previously purchased our daughter a Hohner Glockenspiel (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/B001TR0742/dp/B001TR0742/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">B001TR0742</a>&nbsp;and had hoped that this set would complement the wonderful sounds she has been able to make on it. My SILs with older children used to tell me how great M & D products are, but it appears that their quality has really plunged in the past 5 years. I'm hoping to receive some of their good-quality toys as hand-me-downs!	-1
Daughter got this as a gift. The maracas are so muffled you cannot hear the sound when you shake it!! My daughter loves the tambourine though. It is her favorite part of this. Be careful of the wooden pallet it comes in, it seems that Melissa and doug does not sand their wood, so its easy to get a splinter. Ouch!	-1
my 1year old daughter has already put a hole through the tamborine after dropping it and it landed on a pebble *while playing with it at her birthday party and just received it moments before..i might add*, the clacker thing is held together with a cheap piece of elastic rope...which she has already undone and lost the 1 piece..the maracas are bad...they're not loud or any thing..it sounds like there are 4 or 5 grain of rice inside..and the wooden instrument...she has no interest in it musically...but she likes chewing on them....the symbols, and triangle are ok ...simply due to they make sharp loud noise...which is what she likes...i'm not happy with this purchase AT ALL...	-1
Pretty durable, good educational toy but that's about all I can say thats positive about it! I would definitely not recommend this! I was debating about the more expensive brand even though Melissa &Doug are usually pretty good quality, but now that I have purchased this and have seen the quality of the other brand! I would have definitely paid the extra to get the other! Oh well! The symbols don't even make a symbol sound! Prettty lame if you ask me! Comes in a super cheap cheesy container with fake grass in it! weird?!!! I thought so too!	-1
I wish I had read the reviews on this product before I bought it.  We have several other M&D products for our son and they all are good quality.  My son received the band in a box for his 3rd birthday.  The tamborine was broken in about 2 minutes, shorter than it took to get all the instruments out of the box!  He's been to various music classes and most kids bang anything on anything to make music.  So, when he hit the tamborine with the wooden stick from the box, none of us were expecting it to shatter.  We returned it to the store, thinking maybe it was just bad luck.  When we got the second one home, it lasted 30 minutes.  Mostly because I was playing the tamborine.  Then as we were putting the instruments back in the box, my son hit the tamborine with the metal rod from the triangle.  Shattered again.  Now we have to decide whether to bring it back again and find something else or just tear off the broken skin and use it like that.  If the tamborine is so delicate it shouldn't be in a box of instruments for 3 years+.	-1
It came in an amazon box, not even the box it originally comes in. The condition was bad. The numbers don't move that well, the wood was scratched, and the felt was poorly glued in the dice rolling area. The dice were also really small, and I mean like so small to where you had to look closely at it in order to see the numbers, I was very displeased and had to buy a whole other Shut the Box Game. It was a little more money, but the way it came was way better than this.	-1
I bought this because a friend told me she plays it all the time with her grandchildren.  I found it very uninteresting as did my grands. There is no challenge, not much thinking involved.  It's pretty much all luck of the dice.	-1
Arrived damaged. Two items inside purse were broken	-1
Cheaply made, toys barely fit in top of purse, would reccomend a different toy purse.	-1
The wallet is made out of thin cheap plastic. It's broken the first day we opened it. Couldn't return it because we are on vacation.	-1
This is very cheaply made and we were going to give this to someone as a present but we gave it away because we felt it was too cheap.	-1
I bought this for my niece. I thought it was cute however it was a little pricey for the quality of it. The phone that comes with it does not even have push buttons.	-1
Not crazy about the item for the price. I tried to cancel it as soon as I ordered it when I read the description. I don't know why it went through so I'm stuck.	-1
NOT a good gift for a 2-year-old. More for a 1-year old. I had to go out and buy something more age-appropriate. This is just sitting in my house, gathering dust. Overpriced and too simplistic for recommended age. Disappointed and out the money.	-1
Phone and keys don't  make any sounds. All items are pretty big. Would have like a shoulder strap for the purse	-1
I did not like the quality for the price so returned it	-1
This was ok, a short lived toy at most. My daughter wasn't as excited about this as I thought she would be.	-1
cheap very very cheap and wasn't worth the money	-1
Very flimsy, and very cheeply made.	-1
its short lived and was quickly discarded	-1
Not what I expected	-1
Very cheap.	-1
It looks so cute, but my 18 months daughter just play few minutes then not interested it.	-1
I was disappointed in this little item.  My granddaughter bugged me for it and then when it arrived, I found the toys inside to be really cheap looking.  If I had it to do over, I would have purchased only a little purse and then put some little toys inside purchased apart from the purse.	-1
I wish the phone made noises. My 1 yr old got this for Christmas and she doesn't play with it much.  She likes the real thing better, of course!  I can't keep her out of my purse.	-1
Bought these for my 3 and a half year old granddaughter. Its ok but for the price the dollar store could beat it, The phone does nothing.	-1
First off, we thought at first this was an absolutely great product. Our daughter loved it the moment we gave it to her. BUT, the phone's buttons don't push down, the debit card has a sticker on it so for a teething 2 year old that is simply not cool. Also the stitching has already popped on one of the handles of the purse, so the baby can now eat stuffing if she wants. She only has played with it a handful of times. This really wasn't well made, and I almost wish I could get a replacement. I think if you have a young kid under the page of 14 months this would be fine, but those who will actually play with it, walk around, or use it as they're supposed to it just won't stick with them.	-1
Wasn't pleased with this item at all.  A waste of money. Kids like toys the make noise to awaken their senses.  This toy is a bunch of stick on plastic.	-1
It is very very basic. Obviously for the money you do get what you pay for.  It was enough to teach the game to my five-year-old granddaughter, since she likes it I will be buying a Better Built one.	-1
In theory this is a great toy, but the manufacturers skimped on the quality.  It would have been nice if the lipstick went up or down or made clicking noises.  Also, the cellular phone does not make any sounds at all and the buttons do not depress.  If these features were improved, it would make for a better toy.	-1
I bought this to teach my grand daughter how to play checkers. I liked the idea of a wooden board and checkers something a little better then the card board one I had 65 years ago. The board it's self is not bad but the quality of the checkers leaves a lot to be desired. The ribbing on the checkers are not deep enough to interlock letting them slide around when kinged. I will have try and find a set of plastic set and use the board.	-1
Cheap, cheap, cheap. A plastic set would have been nicer.	-1
poor quality. paint is peeling off.	-1
The board is in horrible condition.  I ordered it in February and kept it in my towel pantry closet, which is dry.  Didn't open it until today, in June because the kids were restless.  I almost cut my finger on the board taking it out of the box,  the thin top layers have separated and split from the thicker wood on top and bottom.  Very disappointed in the quality of this game board.  Now I have to glue the board together. Oh what fun!	-1
My daughter recieved this purse as a gift and we found it was missing some of the pieces. Since the pieces were sealed in a bag, it was a clearly problem from the manufacturer. When we went to exchange it, we found all of the purses on the shelf were missing at least the mirrors! Pretty bad quality control, if you ask me. We ended up stuck with an incomplete toy... pretty dissapointing.	-1
This checkers/chess set is irritating.  The board is thick and durable, but it is also small.  When you stack the checkers to "king" someone, the top piece easily slides off because there are no ridges on the checkers. I am returning it.	-1
I bought this sandbox because of the good reviews. I wanted a sandbox that would grow with my grandchildren to age 8.  Normally, I like Step2 products. It had a cover that would protect the sand from cat poop, and I thought this cover would keep the sand dry. Today, I was adding some more sand toys to the sandbox and noticed that all the sand was wet, even though it had been covered.  So I take a closer look at the cover and notice there are holes and places for the water to get in when it rains. I'm not happy. So, our next very warm day, I'm going to take off the cover and hopefully, the sand will dry out. There's a neighborhood cat that runs around, so I will have to also keep watch for that cat. If I had known the sand wouldn't be fully protected, I wouldn't have bought it. It's way to late to return. Plus, what do I do with 200 pounds of sand? Shaking my head at Step2!  So, I spoke to the people at Step2, and the reason there are holes (where water can get in) is because of safety reasons. Apparently, in 2009 they had to put those hole in to the design to avoid suffocation. What parent allows a child to climb into a sandbox and put the cover over  their head?  I guess it can happen.  Amazon, you need to remove the part where it says cover protects from weather elements.  Still, I'm stuck with wet sand in sandbox.	-1
the lid will not stay on. so the sand is never dry and the lid is always in the ditch.  wish I had never gotten it.	-1
My son received this as a Christmas gift. As far as having fun, playing in the sand...it's great (but so are cheaper boxes). However, you'd think that being an outdoor toy, it would be made to stand up against sun, rain...did I mention sun???  The lid warped within a week and with a warperd lid the rain and bugs get in.  There is no drain (but SHOULD be), so water would sit, turn the sand a greenish color and probably hold some mosquito larvae in the standing water (I live in central FL).  Yuck!	-1
There is no point to this game and would only be fun for 2-5 year olds. Basically a matching game and thats it. It was a complete waste of money and I wish I hadn't purchased.	-1
I thought this would be fun for our 3 and 4 year old.  buts its really TOO easy and they were bored quickly!	-1
Had to give this to younger children as my 7 year old was not interested in such a simplistic game.	-1
Well, I love the ocean and everything in it and about it. My daughters room is decorated with a "fishy" theme. However, I wasn't impressed with this at all! First off, the batteries wear out too quick! And yes, I DID turn it off when she wasn't using it. And yes, I DID use new batteries. Also, the fish that "swim" get stuck and don't move and the glitter clumps into one spot. The balls were a hit though! She loves those!	-1
This is a very attractive toy. The ocean sounds are so realistic you feel as if you were on the beach. That is my impression. My grandson (10 months) however has a different view.  For the first day or so after the toy arrived he would pick the balls up and hold them in his hands while trying to get the little items inside to spin around. However, they would only spin once or twice and stop. He would push the bowl around and listen to the ocean sound for a bit but it was too heavy for him to get it to make the splashing sound. I had to jiggle the bowl in order for him to hear that. He never quite got the "dropping the balls in the bowl" part. He would drop them in and nothing, to him anyway, would happen so that ended pretty quick.  He hasn't played with it since that first day or two after it arrived.  I would not recommend this product unless you are looking for a nice item to put on your child's shelf.	-1
The questions in this game are fine.  They did seem a little more difficult than some other versions, but my complaints are almost solely on the design.  The board is flimsy.  It feels something like one of those games you might cut out of the back of a cereal box, and there are maybe half as many cards as in the standard versions.  What you are paying for is the fancy-schmancy plastic card dispenser that doesn't work!  You're supposed to just slide a card out and start reading, but you usually end up holding two or three.  What was so difficult about taking the cards out of a box?  The game is a classic.  You don't need to redesign it every time, just make more cards.	-1
Yikes!  There's trivial, but then there's ridiculous.  If you're over 30, playing this game is laughable.  So obscure are some of the questions and answers -- that it's really more of a guessing game than one that tests your knowledge.  It's too bad, since previous editions are fun.  And sorry, I agree that the card dispenser can be a bit aggravating -- just give us the box to hold the cards in!!!  Why fix it if it ain't broken?	-1
My son saw this in the store and he liked it.  I like the Chicken Dance, too, so we brought it home.  After the first few days, it became "Wakes You Up with Squaking at 2AM Elmo".  Shortly thereafter it became "No Batteries Elmo".  I just couldn't take it anymore .  The Squaking.....the squaking.	-1
There is no price list included in the game.  The instructions are not clear and confusing on how to play this.  I played it once and it was hard to understand how to do things.  They kids were not impressed.  Good concept though.	-1
This is the first negative review I have written. My children play with playdough several times a week and even go through phases of daily play so we are very familiar with what's good and what's not. We make our own to create varying textures as well as buying the name brand. My oldest daughter was most excited to try out the rollers and my youngest the stamps. They each picked a different kind of play dough (name brand and homemade) to work with, not what was supplied in the package. We immidiately realized that the playdough was sticking in the creases and not just the homemade. I used a toothpick to try and pick all the playdough out from all the crevices but even that didn't remove it all so I tried water with the toothpick...nope! With the few stamps and the one roller we had yet to try we used the dough that comes with the set in case it was compatiable with the stamps, the results were the same. The wheel press did not turn at all, absolute fail. I was really disappointed with this product and I normally am a big fan of Melissa & Doug.	-1
The "molding" substance that came with the set was completely dried up upon arrival.	-1
I wish I could love this, as I am a huge fan of Melissa and Doug products. However, the playdough is crazy sticky!! It sticks to everything: the table, hands, the toys, making it hard to play with and clean up. The tools are cute and great for small toddler hands, probably 3 and under, they are really too small for my 5 year old.	-1
It's a nice combination of tools, but they're wood and the play doh gets stuck in every crevice. Then it dries and that tool is moot. Another point is the play doh is really sticky and makes more of a mess than actual play doh. I wish I would have invested my money elsewhere... Sucks because I love Melissa and Doug products. This one though, is a dud	-1
I have a two year old who absolutely loves playing with playdoh. We spend a lot of time molding and modeling clay so I really wanted to like these over the plastic tools and molds available from other sellers. But the fact is that these do not preform as well. The paint on the wooden stamps is starting to chip a little bit and doh sticks in the grooves all the time. Doh will stick inside other plastic tools on the market too, like extruders (because they have hard to reach grooves), but in my experience, never on stamps. The painted surface on these stamps is not smooth (which is very annoying), and so the doh sticks for that reason too and is harder to clean. The rolling pins look great but are wobbly, and that makes it very hard for my daughter to effectively roll the doh. She barely if ever uses them. The cutter is totally ineffective as far cutting playdoh is concerned (I assume it's a cutter). We love the stamp lids on the small doh cups provided. They stamp well and are fun. They are plastic. The doh provided is really as a token. Very small quantities and the quality is not something to write home about. Make sure you have your own modeling clay/ doh on hand, if you still decide to order this set.	-1
This is a so-so item.  The play-do that comes in the package is very low quality and we just tossed it immediately.  Once color was completely dried up.  I like the idea of the various molds on the rollers and the block stampers.  The cutting wheel broke in a day, which was disappointing. I was able to hot glue it back together but who knows how long that will hold.  Would not purchase again.. .	-1
Clay is cheap and dry.  Stick to the name brand clay	-1
Dough bad. Roller variety worth the cost. Broke on day one but rather fixable. The blocks are rough and seamless, rather impossible as for printing etc. As good as anything playdoh is putting out... that's not saying much though.	-1
I was sooooo excited for this item to come in, but was disappointed once i opened the playdoh-like clay.  It was dry and crumbled when you take it apart.  The clay always left pieces everywhere.  The square molding pieces were useless.  The clay pieces would get stuck inside, which means you had to use a stick or toothpick to take them out every time.  I never felt so angry about a purchase!  I ended up tossing the clay and bought real Play-doh for my daughter to play with.  I would not recommend this product; instead, go buy a seperate roller/molder and play-doh.  It would cost less.	-1
The knock-off playdoh was dry upon opening and the little wood thing in the roller (shown at the bottom of the package) broke off within a couple of days of light use.	-1
handles on the roll pins already fell off, cheap	-1
Pieces are durable but don't work as they were made to. The roller doesn't cut, the dough sticks to the block that are supose to just make imprints and so on....	-1
The plates are sooo tiny. Good colors and lots of options though. Probably would have picked a different set if I knew the plates for that small.	-1
Horrible quality. Playdoh get stuck in the indents on the cubes. The preforated roller has broke on it's second use. Would not but this set again.	-1
Very difficult to work with for my 2 year old. I wouldn't buy this again	-1
Some of the pieces are falling apart.  This is a misstep for the brand	-1
Play dough dried up fast and everything is made super cheap. My son liked it but it did not last.	-1
Once again I should have listened to what others were saying about this product. Everything was so small, especially the plates and cups. Some of the utensils were ok but most were very cheaply made. After we gave them to our daughter, within the next day we took the majority of small stuff away (are in the process of replacing with a higher quality product). I usually read the reviews and take them seriously, I have made two purchases this past month both on Amazon, I read the reviews on both purchases, I should have not purchases them based on the reviews but I did anyway and now I am writing disappointing reviews on both items. Reviews pay off!!!	-1
got this toy for my now 2 year old and its cute but it does NOTHING.  I have a 3 year old and a 2 year old and they both would play with any toy but this one.	-1
The dough is very bright, but this is not such a good thing in my house. The wooden blocks used to push in designs leave paint in the dough. Not impresses.	-1
I hoped for something better. For us, two of the rollers didn't work at first, my husband had to "break them in" so that they roll properly. My daughter mostly uses the little blocks to build towers. :)	-1
This is terrible.  The dough is cheap, not like that 'famous' brand.  Plus there's hardly any of it in the cans.  My grandchild, who is 2-1/2, thinks the rolling pins are hot dogs.  The cutter tool barely gets through the dough.  I am not a fan of Melissa & Doug's products but I gave this a try and it is sitting in the back of the closet.	-1
I purchased this for my son because we are typically fans of Melissa and Doug products and thought he would love this.  The 'stamps' were not sanded and were rough.  The rolling pins really need to be larger, and the playdough is AWFUL!  It was not very plyable from the beginning and dried out within the first couple of weeks, even though we always put it away and sealed it promptly.  There are much better options out there.	-1
It looks cheaper in person.  I wouldn't recommend, but I haven't opened it.  I'm considering returning--not sure if return shipping is worth it.	-1
When will Melissa & Doug figure out that toys like this need lids?! I love the high quality of their products, but they don't do play-doh well. The actual dough is very small and not enough for my 3 year old to make the shape and designs he wanted. Plus the rolling tools don't roll smoothly. He had a hard time with it.  We have several other M&D toys and they all end up losing peices, because although they come beautifuall packaged, as soon as you open it the small pieces escape and they can't be contained.	-1
It's a cute idea, but didn't work well.  The playdough containers are small.  And because the products are all made in wood, the playdoh stuck to them.  Plastic products tend to work better for keeping the dough from sticking to them.	-1
2 or 3 times a year Amazon puts a lot of M&D products on sale... and so I got this for $10.  The blue wheel cutter like thing (looks like a pizza wheel) was worth the $10 all buy itself.  Our toddler loves it.  Nothing else in the set is worth 2 cents.  Play-Doh plastic roller does a much better job at flattening the dough.  The stamps (square blocks) you see in the picture are the only designs you get.... which is just silly, since like a dice, there are 5 more sides to each block that M&D could have utilized for many more patterns  And don't even get me started on the tiny amount of playdoh that comes with this set.  It's pathetic.	-1
l thought these would be better quality being that they're Melissa and Doug. The little jars of playdoh are best hard to open for an adult , let alone a child. The rolling pins with designs are hard to roll and the stampers have chips and rough edges in the wood.  Hoped for a better product than i received and  probably wouldn't recommend or buy again.	-1
I had always heard Melissa & Doug toys were made in the USA, so when I saw them on sale, thought I'd buy some for my grandchild...  Didn't know they are made in China now... with all the problems with dead dogs & cats from bad food/treats, with lead in paint used in toys and drywall/sheet rock problems from China (besides why help support China)... had I known, I'd have never bought them... didn't know until the presents were opened so I can't return them...  They burned well in the fireplace (hope the smoke I didn't kill any birds flying overhead)  Will never buy another toy from this company	-1
I like the fact that they are made of what seems to be wood with plastic handles. I think they will be better for very young children given their small size. As I stated in another review. Time will tell as the children test this product.	-1
The dough was too small in quantity for each color and wasn't as malleable as Play-Doh.  The tools were ok, but the rolling pin with the grooves seemed completely useless, all it did was get the dough stuck in the tiny crevices. We don't get much use from this set and I wouldn't recommend it. Just stick with the basic rolling pins and cookie cutters.	-1
I'm sorry to report that this is a terrible set of playdough toys. one of the wooden stamping blocks broke within five minutes of my son playing normally with it. The dough was horrible but I didn't care about that. The rollers are not long enough to be of any use, the "cutter" is too chunky to cut, and the wooden stampers just get things stuck in them and since they are wood you can't really wash them. The rubber stampers are fun though. Needless to say, we were really disappointed.	-1
Disappointing!  The molds are teeny tiny little caps to little cups of play-dough that is too hard for easy molding. The three rolling pins are the best part, sized for little hands.  The block molds are both tiny, and not sharply defined enough to make good impressions.  Would not recommend.	-1
Let me start out by saying I am a big fan of little people & had them as a child & have bought them for my child.  BUT I really dislike this toy!!  It looks like lots of fun but the cars won't loop the loop & stay on the track which is pretty much the whole idea of the toy.  The ferris wheel & swing are mildly entertaining but my daughter ignored the entire set until she realized that some (& only some) of her hot wheels cars will run the loop completely.  Fortunately, I didn't have to pay a dime for this toy as I got it free from a Pampers giveaway but unfortunately my belief in Little people has been tainted & I will be more careful when purchasing them.  I really thought their standards were higher but I guess this one slipped through their qc department!!!	-1
This toy was my first Fisher-Price purchase for my son and it was a complete waste of time and money!! The top of Roller Coaster kept coming off and the loop track came off very easily. (which my son had around his neck in a matter of seconds.) The ferris wheel and flying planes, grew tiresome after a few minutes. My son still plays with the smaller Fisher-Price sets, but the Fun Park was sent back to the store two days later!	-1
This set looks like a lot of fun, but it is just not all I expected, nor what my kids like.  The parts come off way to easily (ie: the ferris wheel and swings), the cars do not do the loopydyloop very well, leading to frustration, you have to get it on JUST RIGHT and even than...it doesn't usually work, even for an adult.  This toy is hardly ever played with, it lost its appeal the week that my daughter got it for her first birthday a year ago and has hardly been touched since.  Usually the little people sets have been a winner, but this one is not worth the money and space it takes up. Unfortunately it is rather large, and when a toy that large is not played with...well I consider it a waste of space.  The Little People Farm set is played with on regular basis as well as the bus and safari set.  We have the sets from a few years ago when Fisher price didn't have to put noises on ALL their toys! BUT, that is a pet peave that I won't go into today.	-1
was to climb up & get things that are out of reach!  That's not what I intended for it to do at all.  I bought this for my child when she was a little over two years old.  She was past the pull up & stand stage, but I figured she could learn a few things or at least have fun.  Well, we set this up easily enough, and unlike other reviewers have said, our table was very steady (must have gotten lucky), but this can have a downside.  Well, my daughter was happy with it for a few weeks.  She especially liked the little purple open/close door, but after that, she didn't touch it at all.  Then it became more than a pain (for us parents) than a pleasure.  Like I said, our table was very steady so my daughter frequently used it to get to things high up that she normally couldn't reach.  I almost wished it weren't steady, so she'd be afraid to climb up on it.  She also began using the hole behind the purple door as a spit cup (trust me, it's even more unpleasant than it sounds).  Also, like many people have said before me, the purple door comes off very easily.  I got extremely sick of replacing it time and time again.  About six months after I bought the toy, it went up into our attic, and I doubt it'll come down again (in fact, I'm thinking of throwing it out).  It's just a major pain in the you know what, and it takes up a lot of space, especially if you have a lot of toys and a small house.  About the other features:  I thought the little instruments were cute, but my daughter wasn't interested in them.  The jazzy sound is different.  I didn't think the female singing voice was all that bad.  On loud mode, it was pretty loud, but the lower mode was reasonable.  But the minuses definitely outweigh the pluses, that's for sure.  I'm very disappointed in this toy and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.	-1
My daughter's grandmother bought this for her as a Christmas present and it's the worst toy I've ever seen. As if there wasn't enough crap when kids get OLDER that dumbs them down!  Very simple acitivies, nothing to "learn" about it once they're past about 8 months old and they should have mastered these skills. It's just a table o' chaos - overstimulation anyone? This is great at keeping kids entertained, but there are BETTER, simpler toys that will keep them playing and learning for a much longer time - try anything by Melissa & Doug.	-1
What can I say, there is no accounting for childrens' tastes.  I purchased this for my daughter and son and they only played with it for about half-an-hour before toddling and crawling off never to play with it again.  There is nothing wrong with this toy.  It seems rugged enough--it is not terrible stable but doesn't break when it falls over-- but they did not find it very entertaining.  Son crawled off to play with giant legos and daughter went off to play with Barbie.  Perhaps the problem is the lack of diversity in what the table can do.  I mean after you make the banjo play a few times, how exciting is it to make it do it again.  Likewise, it does not offer any opportunities to use/develop one's imagination.  For the price you might want to look elsewhere.  Ours went to the neighbors twins.	-1
Grandma bought this for our 6 month old daughter.  I don't like that no matter which toy she plays with, the lights in the middle start blinking.  I would prefer for each toy to just "do its own thing." For example, when she hits the bead rattle thing, she wants to look and listen to the beads, but gets distracted by all the blinking lights and music.  Same is true for the banjo. I wish Grandma got the cheaper set of blocks, instead.	-1
Dont give UNCLE MILTON. Your business that is..it is October Still NO tadpoles. They just do not even care.  My child has asked constantly for them.  He is so upset..do not get this product..boycott the manufacturer.	-1
I purchased this for my junior high, science classroom. I ordered two tadpoles in mid-August, and they didn't arrive until mid-January! I was thankful that I had not planned any lessons around them until they arrived. One has not yet developed legs (as of mid-April). The other grew back legs, one front leg, and then completed his change while the students were out for Spring Break.  It was hard for the students to maintain their excitement over the four months it took for one to change, and they are convinced that the second one won't make the switch until after they leave for summer (another 5 weeks) since it hasn't developed legs at all yet.  It was very hard to find food for the frog once it developed. It wouldn't eat the smallest mealworms, and the size of its head dictated that I purchase "pinhead" crickets on a tight schedule so it would be able to eat them before they became too large. An option would be to raise the crickets, too.  The frogs cannot be released into the wild, as they are lab-raised and will die. The tadpoles are easy to maintain, but once they become frogs, they require more care and attention. It is very important to know what you're getting into, and to plan on what will happen to the animals once they become frogs.  My students were upset when the classroom aquarium developed a fungus and all of our fish died, so I am hoping that the amphibians fare better than the fish. Also, I had to plan for their care over the summer (assuming they live.)  Update - both frog and tadpole died shortly after my initial review - one drowned over the weekend. Other reviews have expressed concerns that the small frogs are not able to climb onto "land" and drown; I think this was the case. The little frog didn't eat anything - I tried small mealworms and pin-head crickets as suggested. The other tadpole never developed legs, didn't eat, and wasted away. Horrible waste of life, and a disappointment to the students.  If I could do it again, I'd skip getting this kit, grab some wild tadpoles from the local pond, let them change, and then plop them back in their original pond. It would be just as educational for the students, and the frogs would be better off than they would be in a classroom environment. The tadpoles are easy to maintain, but once they become frogs, they require more care and attention.	-1
When I ordered this item, I thought it would be durable, at least. The instant I removed it from the packaging, I could tell that the entire thing, the base as well as the upper area that houses the frog, including the lid, was made of the kind of thin, disposable plastic that holds a doll in place in a package. No kidding. If you push in with your finger, it gives in. I was amazed that it even held water. The cave is tiny, maybe for a just-grown froglet. We needed something asap for a frog my son caught in a pond and I GUESS this is better than a sand bucket with a plate on top, but just barely. What is funny is that the feeding hole at the top has a plastic cap that is inset and you remove the cap to put in live bugs. That cap is made of a heavier, stronger type of plastic than the entire container. I really feel ripped off by this product and I am surprised at Uncle Milton. I should have gotten the Discovery Kids Frog Habitat, which we have had in the past and was made of regular heavy plastic, like a fish tank. The only reason I didn't get that again is because it has crevices that are impossible to clean and make the whole thing smell badly. At least it was not made of lightweight, disposable plastic casing. I do not have experience with ordering tadpoles because we caught our frog. When I put the lid back on this tank, I push the sides in so that the sides will conform to the shape of the lid, that's how flimsy it is. I would not recommend this product to anyone nor would I buy it if I had seen it in person to see how lightweight and flimsy the plastic is. The entire product is really, really just the thickness of one of those heavy-duty Solo brand beer cups, no kidding.	-1
I found this frog kit on clearance at my local store and bought it for my son.  The directions were a little hard to follow and had a major mistake in them (about how much water to put in when initially introducing the tadpole to the environment).  It took about 3 months to get our tad pole, and even though we followed the directions as closely as we could, the tadpole lived only a week.  Definitely a waste of money.	-1
My child received this product as a gift for Christmas. The quality of this product is beyond poor. Very cheap. Plastic is very thin, flimsy, bendable. You could actually tear/rip the plastic if you wanted to. Don't waste your money. Invest in a higher quality terarium. Beyond me how this product could even be manufactured and sold! Very disappointed. Considering sending back and purchasing a much better quality terarium for the same price and much easier to clean.	-1
This is one of the most annoying toys that I have ever encountered.  It is loud (even when set on the low setting) and has a very grating female voice in one of the two modes.  When left in the "on" position, it also sometimes activates itself - gave me a huge scare in the middle of the night when I heard banging and went into my living room to find bright lights flashing around and banging noises!	-1
We finally received our tadpoles in November!  How fun it was to watch them swim in their new plastic (flimsy) home.  Ack...I knew at some point I would have to buy them a real tank, but thought I'd see if they turned into frogs first.  The months past and nothing happened...November, December, January, February, March, April and whoah now mid-May.  We finally got a froglet!  He was adorable with his new legs!  He swam around like a kid just learning how to ride a bike!  Ahh but his crappy home was the beginning of the end. He got his leg caught  in the ledge and died a half hour later. :-( We still have 1 more tadpole we are waiting on here. I will be out today buying him a new home so he doesn't end up like his friend. VERY sad to watch happen. I'm sorry I didn't just buy a real tank from day 1.	-1
This is really a cool idea, but the habitat is VERY flimsy.  Don't plan on moving it around much once you get it set up.  I'll let you know how cleaning the habitat goes.	-1
This is a flimsy plastic that could easily break is the first problem 2nd was sending for the tadpoles, the first 2 we waited and waited several months and they ended up dead so we sent away for new ones, those actually came with one of the tadpoles already died, actually it looked cut so I think it was dead when it left the company but can't be sure, since it was gauranteed they slowly sent us a new one but neither that or the other one lasted more than a month and had no signs of becoming a frog, we followed the instructions so not sure what the problem was even tried talking to the pet store as well, we finally just gave up b/c it was too hard for the kids pets to keep dying.  I would list the info on it but it is pretty self explanatory from the picture, would list good points but there really aren't any.	-1
The motor literally stopped functioning 13 minutes after I installed the AA duracell battery.  Replaced the battery multiple times with same effect.  Ironically the light still functions fine which is a feature I really enjoyed as did my son. The build of the train seems very high quality and I was very impressed with the detailed paint job.  Unfortunately its failure crushed my 3 year old son!! I will order it again and give it a second chance.	-1
I was SO excited to give this to my 2 1/2 year old for Christmas, but it has been more of a pain than anything. We have gone through 2 batteries in 6 days with Thomas, he can't seem to make it uphill anymore, and the motor has officially given out. The interesting part is that Thomas was used the least of my sons battery powered trains (Thomas and James). The battery powered trains are pretty useless as push trains, as they are very heavy and make a noise like you are winding them up when they move forward. My son has the James battery powered train which still seems to be running fine (after 6 days), but I'm thinking about removing these and going back to push trains only, as he once had so much fun pushing his trains around for hours and now he just watches James go around the track with so much less involvement.	-1
I bought this toy for my grandsons who adore Thomas.  They had great fun with it at first; however, as soon as the track was laid, it became apparent that this "wood railway" toy could not navigate any but the widest of turns without running off the track.  That's no fun after all.	-1
My son recieved this as a birthday gift 2 months ago.  He LOVED it even though it didn't corner well on our Mellissa and Doug train track.  He mostly let it run on the floor, not the track, so that wasn't that big of an issue.  It did, however, break after one fall from counter height.  My son let it drive off the kitchen counter and after only 2 short months it is officially broken.  It can still be played with but because it is meant to be motor driven it doesn't work that well as a push-powered train.  Overall I'm disappointed, a toy that only last 2 months just isn't worth it.	-1
We own a ton of Thomas vehicles. These battery powered ones for the wooden railway are my least favorite. First, they're *heavy*! That means that if they fall from the train table (or he is playing "Accidents Happen") the HURT when they fall on your foot (or an unsuspecting baby's head). If they get thrown, they could do some serious damage. That alone is not enough to make me dislike them, because those are thing that are correctable by altering my son's habits and play behavior. The clincher is that they just don't work. We have the spiral mountain expansion track on our table, and none of the battery powered vehicles we have can make it up the hill unless they have a brand new *nonrechargeable* battery. On top of that, when they get "stuck" spinning their wheels trying to go up the hill, the rubber gripping on the bottom of the wheels starts to flake off and makes a gross mess all over the track. These are SO not worth the money when you consider that the Trackmaster trains are half the price, come in more variety, and can pull more cars behind them because they don't couple together with only magnets. If you have a major Thomas fan, just get him the Trackmaster line if you want battery powered vehicles. These are overpriced, don't work well, and in my opinion can be dangerous in the hands of a tantruming two year old.	-1
This train stopped working after a week. We thought it was the battery but no. It was just a pain and ended up going to waste. Along with the money spent on it.	-1
Our battery operated James is defective. At first we thought that this train is different built than our other battery operated train Salty and therefore weaker. Salty operates almost perfectly, chugs up the hills and takes the turns, whereas James could not go up hills and could not pull wagons, and overall seemed much slower than Salty. Upon closer inspection and comparison with Salty (after return period was already over), we discovered that for Salty 4 wheels are powering the movement (eg., battery makes two front wheels and two back wheels turn), whereas for our James only two front wheels are turning. Of course, it makes sense that this way James cannot move as fast and as well as Salty. So our James is defective...hoping that we can exchange it.	-1
This is the correct wooden railway train; however, it doesnt' stay on the track much at all.  I purchased this for my son who loves Thomas and friends and he has battery-powered Thomas and James.  Percy is another likable character so I purchased this for him for easter.  However Percy runs off the track frequently especially around curves.  You have to be sure the tracks are flush to one another and keep it that way which is not likely with a 2.5 year old.  I believe this is because Percy only has 4 wheels as compared to the other trains, like Thomas, which have 6 wheels.  I believe that center non-motorized wheel on the other trains work as guidance and keep it on the track.  So this is annoying to keep putting the train back on the track continuously.  All of these trains burn through batteries quickly so i recommend the lithium batteries.  they have a little more power and last a little big longer.	-1
We have four battery operated engines (Thomas, Percy, Lady, James) and James was the last one purchased. James can not make a complete circle without derailing. Also, he can't make it up one of the low Thomas drawbridges. It has nothing to do with the way our track is set up because we did it according to manufacturer's instructions.  Even in our own custom set up we removed all small curved track and James had serious problems. Even when Thomas didn't. There is no consistency from engine to engine. It is disappointing.	-1
We have Battery Operated Thomas and Battery Operated James.  Other than the color they look very similar, and, I suspect, use the same mechanics.  Unfortunately, James derails very often on the same tracks that Thomas has no problem navigating.  I have two tracks: a coal sifter figure 8 and the oval starter kit from Target.  James derailes on each one of the tracks separately as well as on the layout I created by combining the two sets.  Sometimes it'd go around fine one time and then derail on the second run - very strange.  Battery Operated Thomas almost never derails.  On the positive side, my two-year old son loves these trains.	-1
Ok, maybe it's just me, but you'd think that a battery operated train designed for toddlers should be able to withstand, oh, I don't know . . . toddlers.  Our toddler doesn't quite get that he can't push James around like he can the non- battery operated trains.  It appears that pushing him (rather than letting him motor on his own) stripped the gears.  Now the light goes on, but the wheels won't turn. That was a big waste of $30.	-1
We have four battery operated engines (Thomas, Percy, Lady, James) and Percy was the second one purchased.  We had Percy for two weeks when the switch would no longer work properly.  The switch turned him on every other time, then completely stopped working.  So, we returned him for another.  The one we currently have does not stay on the track if you use the small curved track anywhere in the setup. But, Thomas handles it fine. There is no consistency from engine to engine. It is disappointing.	-1
The engine comes off the tracks all the time - even when it is used with track of the same brand (Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway).  This is a pain.  Our child is frequently asking us to help to get it back on the track.  But more importantly, it is a disappointment for the child.  Our 2 year old was extremely excited about this toy when he opened the present.  After playing with it a short while he said "This train is bad. It's broken."  That's not the memory you want your family to have on Christmas.  It doesn't seem like it should be difficult to make a toy train go around a track reliably.  Don't buy this toy.	-1
Item not as pictured and you have to capture your own ants... Waiting for spring to see how that goes.	-1
Didn't get item pictured. Doesn't cone with sand. Too thick to really see the tunnels.	-1
Very hard to put the ants into and hard to not nock over	-1
My son loves ants so I was so excited to get him his first ant farm! I was not aware that you had to have fat ants for this farm, so every ant my son caught crawled right up and out of the ant farm. After reading the instructions it turns out you need fat ants? And of course you can buy them from Uncle Milton products. Obnoxious. All the ants we caught (following directions for food and water) were dead within 3-4 days or they escaped. Sad disappointment.	-1
What good is this ant farm without ants? I bought this 6 weeks before my son's birthday understanding that receiving live ants takes extra time, but after 6 weeks we still have no ants. We live in California, so there can't be weather delay issues. I have tried contacting them several times, but with no reponse. What am I supposed to do now? I even had to pay the shipping for the ants. $20 with the farm and ant shipping all down the drain, and his birthday has come and gone. 6 weeks is plenty of time for them to ship these fricking ants! That's just terrible business right there.	-1
DO NOT BUY UNCLE MILTON PRODUCTS!  I purchased an Uncle Milton ant farm for my daughter on Christmas and on 12/26 she ordered her ants.  Ten days later after not receiving them I sent them an email request for status.  I have received no answer.  Today I called their office and tried all extensions - with no answer on *any* of them (accounting, sales, customer support, vendor support)  The only safe assumption is that Uncle Milton is closed for business.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR ANTS	-1
This product is garbage.  We couldn't get the ants to stay alive.  The company was great about sending us new ants, 2 different times, but they all kept dying.  My older son had one of these years ago and his was great.  His ants seemed to live forever (so we do know how to care for them).  I don't know if it has something to do with the new ones not using sand now or not.	-1
I bought this figure the night before I went for my driving test and was verrry disappointed in it.  Don't get me wrong, the face looks EXACTLY like Natalie's, and I like her and all, but this figure is a disgrace to her.  Where do I begin with the problems?  For one thing, she is much smaller than the other figures, her head is too small for her body, and compared to my Ep1 Padms, she is shorter and not just with her legs in the "battle stance", I mean her whole body is misproportioned, as with the Obi Wan Coruscant Chase figure.  The other pathetic thing about this Padm figure is her right arm that sticks out because of the "quick draw" action when you move her waist.  The arm doesn't stay down, which is very annoying.  After my test the next day, I packaged her up, told the sales rep. she was defective, and got a Taun We in its place.  I will now patiently wait for a better scaled with no-sticking-out-right-arm Padm Amidala figure.	-1
This is the first Star Wars Chapter 2 figure I've purchased, and may well be the last. I collect toys as a hobby, and before the film's opening, I saw this in a Toys R Us, and was amazed by the spectacularly detailed paint job and beautiful sculpting. But it's a good thing I wasn't buying this for a child to play with. Once you get past the toy's looks, there is nothing else to be said in it's favor. The figure's head can barely be moved, and the arms, posed to hold the lightsaber, are also terribly limited in their movability. Making matters worse is that the lightsaber is made in two pieces - a 2" translucent plastic "blade" which plugs into the second piece, a tiny handle less than 1/2" long. As a father, I shudder to think of how much frustration this will make for the kids. What do they do if the tiny plug breaks off the blade, and it can't be reattached to the lightsaber? And worse, what do they do if they loose that beautifully sculpted and painted but criminally small handle? When the first three Star Wars films were released, the toys were poorly sculpted, simply painted, and could be easily played with. Since then, toy companies have learned just how much money can be made by targeting (some) adult collectors (not me!) with big, expensive items. The popularity of Star Wars toys with collectors appears to have prompted Hasbro into making the whole line as much (if not more)for adult collectors as for the kids. As a result, Shaak Ti is a very nice looking display piece, but little else.	-1
Even though I've almost completed my EpII collection, this was one of the first action figures I bought.  During the arena battle, Kit sticks out as an excellent fighter with a cool look and determined facial expression.  So as my favorite non-main character, I selected him among the first. The figure itself is pretty good.  The paint, like on all EpII figures, is terrible.  Every time I go to buy one, I have to compared 4 or 5 of the same character to find one where the paint looks halfway decent.  The Force Pull effect is worthless.  I wish Hasbro would just make realistic, fully-articulated replicas instead of these stiff, gimmicky figures.  I gave this a 5-rating for "Educational" because it taught me that tiny magnets have virtually no attractive effect. Despite these limitations, Kit is a cool character and worthy of an EpII collection.  Just don't try to play with it because it's no fun.	-1
This version of travel scrabble is terrible.  The letters don't go in the holes and pop out easily when they do go in.  I lost a piece on the first use??!!!! The travel case is now used to hold tools.  And the game was pitched out.  Someone needs to bring back the magnetic version my parents had in the 1950's.  Bottom line don't waste your money.	-1
I love Scrabble.  My parents taught me to play when I was 12 (many, many years ago) and I've loved it ever since.  My husband and I bought this version of the game so we could take it on the road with us.  And, it would be great except that it's almost impossible to get the tiles into the squares.  They pop out frequently when you are trying to put them in.  My parents have a travel version where you can just lay the tiles in the squares.  Why did they change it?	-1
Scrabble is one of my favorite games, but I really am not impressed with the quality of this travel edition.  The board refuses to lie flat, making it nearly impossible to stick letters in the rows bordering the hinges.  The letters are difficult to pop into their spaces on the board.  The racks, for some absurd reason, have 7 individual slots in them, so shuffling tiles is a near impossibility.  This is highly unimpressive.  If I want a word game when I'm traveling, I like the Quickwords travel edition MUCH more than this.  I love Scrabble, but I'll leave it at home until they come up with a better travel edition.	-1
Toy was great for the three weeks that it worked.  We received it for Christmas and already (jan 19) it no longer goes when the exhaust thing is pushed. Everything else still makes noise, so not a battery issue.	-1
My son loved this toy. I bought it when he was 8 months. Since then, we bought 2 more, and they all stopped working (kept rolling but didn't make animal sounds) after less than a month.	-1
This is one of those products where I have to wonder if everyone else has the same toy we have... So, where to start...  First thing you will notice with this toy is the sounds, they are pretty terrible quality. But what is worse is the sound effects for the tractor... which sounds like a rig. Tractors don't beep when they back up, let alone when they are driving forward. Tractors don't have air brakes either. The sounds from this tractor toy are taken from a rig and it makes no sense to my son who knows exactly what a tractor sounds like. You'll notice the advertisement video cuts off right before the annoying and unrealistic beeping and air brakes kick in.  After barely being used for a year, I got the toy out again for another go and found that the electronics were all messed up, the song won't play unless you push the sheep, press the horn, and then push down on the farmer seat... Also 2 of the animals don't work and the horn itself now does nothing other than work as part of the song sequence. Yes, I changed the batteries.  The paint on the plastic will come off if your child chews on it, into their mouths. It will also chip off through normal play. Our farmer looks pretty poor for a toy barely used.  This was a gift and I hate to say bad things about a gift, but this is the worst toy in our home.	-1
not original	-1
Kind of a piece of junk. not easy to use, flimsy plastic. My son has no interest in it because of the cheap quality.	-1
It was pretty basic, did not come with instructions and was missing the book.	-1
Garbage. It was a paint to get put together. A pain to find a lightbulb and even worse to use.	-1
Kinda babyish and looks nothing like stars	-1
Not what I expected at all. I would question whether to order the next step up or not.	-1
So cheaply made. This is such a disappointment. I'm wishing we never bought this. The stars are a joke.	-1
This is a pretty chintzy toy.  It is not very sturdy at all, and the tiny little lighbulb does not get very bright so unless it is pitch black in the room and your ceilings are not very high you can not see much.  It does come with some cute star maps, which would be great if you could actually see them. The little dial that shows you what you can see during each month is also a pretty neat idea.  Overall, I would not recommend this.  We opened it, tried to use it once, and now it since unloved in a corner missing most of its pieces and collecting dust.	-1
I an very ticked off... I purchased this back in October for a Christmas present for my son, I let him open it early and I'm really wishing I had inspected this when it came in.. it was advertised as new, however the two lightbulbs that are SUPPOSED to be included are not here. As well as the audio CD, it has many scratches... of course now its too late to return this. But I have attempted to contact the seller to at least get the two light bulbs that SHOULD have been with this, but its been to no avail.. we are now stuck with a used P.O.S. we can't even use, because Walmart, and a few of the home improvement stores do not carry the right ones ( I've also spent almost 15$ on lightbulbs I hope would work, but haven't!!!) So tickets off	-1
Years ago I purchased a planetarium for one of my grandsons as a birthday gift.  I wanted to have one for when my grandchildren come over so I purchased what looked like a good product.  Was I ever disappointed!  It didn't work!  Its really a piece of junk that just sits there.  I was so disgusted that instead of contacting the seller, which I would usually do, I simply threw it out.  Thats how bad it was.  It wasn't worth the time to go to the post office and return it.  I shouldnt have done it that way, but it was a true reflection of how disappointed I was with this product.  Dont buy it.  Youll be disappointed too.  You should know that I rarely write a negative review.  Im happy with what I purchase from Amazon 99.99% of the time.  You could even check out my reviews and see that for yourself.  But this was just a huge disappointment, very unusual for an Amazon carried product.	-1
Bought this for a foster child, so she'd have athletic toys in the yard, and other kids would want to come play.  It worked for those, and she loves to twirl and spin on it.  I'd say it's great for building upper body strength, takes up a small area, and amuses children for 1-20 minutes at a whack (pretty good for today's child!). PROBLEM:  the plastic handle is joined together by screw/bolts.  These do not sit prettily together after some use and yesterday 2 neighbor kids got blood blisters using it when it pinched their fingers.  Granted, one of them I will be happy not to have return, but I do not like toys that hurt children!  I would return it, but the time just expired.  Anyone know how to make contact with the company?	-1
I believe this game's good reviews and awards are a result of the Cranium namebrand rather than on the merits of this particular game.  Our 4 1/2- and 3-year-olds played this for about three rounds before they lost interest in the "concept" of the game, and basically just wanted to play with the "treasure balls." Even the "advanced" play was easy for the children, and, really, how exciting is opening the same treasure chest with the same chintzy purple jewel over and over and over again anyway?  The one good thing that I do have to say about the game is that it is not competitive but rather team work-oriented, but overall it was a waste of money.  Cranium could have done better for its preschool gamers.	-1
Zingo got great reviews by my 4 year old wasn't interested in playing the actual game.	-1
The mechanism that shoots the tiles out was broken	-1
After reading all the 5-star reviews about Zingo, I was surprised to be quite disappointed by this game.  It is a variation on Bingo, but Bingo, yes Bingo, is better. In Bingo everyone who has B3 or O72 on their card gets to mark it.  But in Zingo, only the fastest player who can grab the tile gets to mark the card.  If you are playing with an older and younger child, the older one is almost always sure to grab it first, leading to unneeded conflicts. If an adult is playing against a child, the adult is surely to always win unless you lose the game purposefully.  In the description the game claims to teach vocabulary recognition, but with words like pig, house, sun, tree, cake, bat, shoe, bird, etc., that's not much teaching of vocabulary for a 4-8 year old.  At least in Bingo, the younger ones are learning 2-digit number recognition.  After a couple of rounds my kids needed to play more than one card to keep up the interest level.  After that the main attraction was the tile dispenser.  That part of the game was most fun of all.  Who would get to be in charge of the sliding tile dispenser?  Soon the tile dispenser was the only thing they were playing with.  The thing I did like was the quality of the cards, tiles, and tile dispenser.  Everything was quality made, not at all flimsy.  If it did get played with, I know it would last.	-1
It's hard to put the plastic chips into the dispenser slot.  I see no need for the chip dispenser to have a cover.  The play cards were warped when received, and still are.  This is just another yelling and grabbing game, with matching, and little thinking.	-1
Zingo is like Bingo with pictures instead of numbers.  My grandson liked it at first and so did I, however by the third game he was ready to turn the cards over to the harder sides, was ready to play two cards at the same time, plus two cards for me, plus two cards for his teddy bear--all at the same time.  The tiles, while very durable, must be loaded into a gadget--a timeconsuming, no fun chore that will be left to the parent or older child.  And it is harder the bigger fingers you have.  I like this as an alternate game, but not if you only just want to buy one to refresh your game stock.	-1
As others have mentioned, the graphics suddenly start to get corrupted after less than 5 minutes of playing.  Turning the game off and back on doesn't seem to help, but leaving it off for 20 minutes or so before turning it back on will let you play for another couple of minutes before it becomes unplayable again.  My best guess is that it's overheating.	-1
Must have gotten pickier as I became older. I was so knocked out by the 10 games in 1 joystick concept. I understand how much technology has shrunk, but that is not what impressed me.  The marketing is right on the money in duplicating the original Atari 2600 joystick.  It's just that 25 years ago (Good Lord, has it been that long?) to play 10 games, you needed 10 cartridges, the Joystick, the game unit with power supply and a TV.  Now you need a joystick and a tv. Wow.  Bought one for my brother and he loved it....for a while. Are the games fun? Well, yes.  Did it bring back memories? Sure did. So what is the problem? Well, the graphics sucked then and they suck now.  Centipede was jazzed up a bit, but visually these games are not as "fun to watch".  If you are one of those folks who lamented getting rid of the ol' 2600, here is a cheap way to get that childhood toy back. But don't expect more than a few days of play.  Especially if you buy other TV Games. This one will find its way to the toy pile quickly.	-1
I purchased this for my kids (3 and 5) but it has been very little fun.  The major problem is the joy stick.  It is so stiff that even I have problems using it.  The second problem is that the software is buggy.  For example, unlike the original game, when you are playing Breakout the ball moves FASTER when you move the joystick.  It should move at its original pace, but instead it picks up speed proportionally as you move making it almost impossible to catch up with the ball.  My advice is to blow your money on something else.	-1
Nice concept but the quality of the joystick is too poor to enjoy the game.  It's difficult to control the paddle on games like pong and breakout because the joystick doesn't respond well to minor position adjustments.  Very frustrating.	-1
Not happy with this item from Melissa & Doug . Piece of wood coming out , not safe for my 2 year old . Some parts get so bad that I have to throw them out !	-1
Made in China. Not happy about that. Wouldnt have purchased otherwise & now I will not give this to my child to mouth and play with. Country of origin is not listed for this toy. Missleading! Should have gone with a Hape toy.	-1
I got two used Melissa & Dough Wooden train sets and a train decoration bookshelf for $15 from a personal seller.  All looked like new when I got them.  This farm stacking train was one of the three sets.  My toddler enjoyed playing with it but I noticed the paints of the train set chipped off easily.  Then I read the review in amazon.com and found out about the recall of this set in Canada.  I realized that's probably the reason the seller sold these like new train sets to me at low price.  Would not recommend it.	-1
Cool but my own personal review of this has to do with my two year old who was interested in this for about an hour and has barely touched it since. She is typically not a toddler to jump from one play item to another, so it was a bit surprising to me that she just did not have a high interest in this toy, especially since she loves trains. Then I played with it. Though very durable and cutely colored, I could barely put the thing together after I took all the blocks off. I started looking around for a paper diagram to remind of how it was assembled, but nothing. I had to google this just to find a picture to put it back together properly. Way too annoying. This again is my own personal experience. As a toy, again, it is beautifully made, durable, I feel safe that it is wood versus strange plastic, etc. But... yeah, wasn't expecting a puzzle.	-1
Not good.	-1
Kiddo has this at daycare, and so grandma thought we should have it at home; and lord, I wish I could have stopped her from sending it. I find this set clunky and excessive. The toppings are just slightly too large to comfortably fit together on the pizza slices, and frankly there are just way too many of them. Does a child really need the ability to make an all-pepperoni, all-mushroom or all-pepper pizza? Given that providing the ability to do so triples the coin-sized disks floating around my house, I'm gonna say "no." Kiddo can learn to love a combo. Forget it. The fun is not worth keeping track of the pieces.	-1
I was so excited to introduce this toy to my 2 year old twins.  They both enjoyed the stacking of the blocks, but then I noticed that my son had a green colored hue on his mouth and over his mouth.  I realized he put the block in his mouth and green paint just flowed all over his mouth and face.  I JUST opened the package about 2 days earlier and already the paint was coming off.  He only was playing with the toy for maybe 10 minutes that morning when I noticed the paint was all over his face and mouth.  I was sad & mad to have to take the toy away so early, but this toy is not made well.  It would have been better if they just stained the wood or left the wood a natural color.  1 star for stacking education.	-1
How did this ever get out of the factory in the condition I received it? I did not have to unwrap the package to see the wood was not smooth but splintered on one of the connectors. In order to put the train together it would need to be grasped right at the site of the splintered wood. This was so disappointing because it was a present for a friend's 2yr old and I know he would have liked it based on the reviews. Now I must run to the store for a gift since it is too late to order anything else.	-1
This toy appears fun, until we realized that once all the pieces were taken off all that was left was a wooden platform and 2 sticks to put the pieces on.  I watched and saw my daughter smack herself on the face with the sticks inches from her eye.  It is also almost impossible to do once all of the pieces have been taken off.  I have to rearrange to try to get the thing back together again.  I don't know how they expect a 2 or 3 year old to do it.  I thought maybe it was because sometimes adults aren't always willing to let themselves think like a child so I let my 8 year old nephew do it.  All of the pieces were taken off and he was pretty annoyed after a brief period of time.  It's good construction, I just wouldn't recommend it.	-1
My mother in law bought this for my son and within hours it started to fall apart. We took it back, got another one and it did the same thing. The 'pegs' that hold the blocks and locks the train together kept falling off, which I actually found one in my sons mouth! the glue was just not holding up.  It was also a real pain because my son couldn't figure out how to stack certain blocks to make it "look" like a train. Small detail, but it wasn't worth my trouble to deal with it anymore.	-1
This toy came apart in my hands before my daughter even had a chance to play with it.  The dowels that are supposed to connect the train parts are not secured and I have had to glue them back in twice.  This toy just feels cheaply made and I don't feel safe letting my daughter play with it unless I have my eyes on her at all times.  She's also the kind of toddler that runs instead of walking and, therefore, falls a lot so I don't like any toy that has hard wooden exposed pieces sticking out since she could fall on top of them pretty easily.  It is now in my donate pile and will go to Goodwill soon.  In my opinion, M&D toys have become very hit and miss recently.  We have a M&D farm puzzle that my daughter and I both love but all of the other M&D toys I've seen or purchased have not been impressive.  This one definitely falls on the disappointing end of the spectrum. Spend your money elsewhere.	-1
Our daughter received this as a gift when she was 18 months old. She loved it and played with it daily on her little play rug. Within a few weeks, the paint was coming off and the wood was pitted. The quality was just terrible. I've noticed every toy she's been given from this brand has the same problem.	-1
It chips, the paint peels off of it, and several of the pegs that are supposed to hold the wooden shapes came unglued. A terrible choking hazard. We got this as a gift, and it's in the garbage. I will never buy a M&D product for my son.  They are crap. There are better natural toys out there.	-1
Like the M&D pounding bench, ,my son enjoyed playing with this and yes, sucking on the pegs. But my daughter won't be because I read that this was recalled in Canada for toxic levels of chemicals. M&D didn't bother to recall it here because the American market is full of suckers who accept lax toy standards. I'll be replacing it with a stacking toy that is NOT MADE IN CHINA and NOT MADE BY M&D.	-1
My daughter is not thrilled about the train. She rarely looks at it. Perhaps, other children would love this toy more. It didn't work that way for us.	-1
The item itself is good but I received the wrong color. It is green instead yellow-ish.	-1
I am not sure why there are so many extra topping pieces.  Otherwise, a fine product.	-1
Kids enjoyed playing with pieces of poorly designed junk. Paint started chipping immediately just like all of M&D junk. Stickers started to come off or wear off too. Threw it away when I refreshed the kitchen toys for my next kid. All of my Plan Toys and Haba play food are in PERFECT condition and were also popular. Just the M&D junk went away.	-1
Very disappointed!! I bought this ahead of time for my daughters birthday and she played with it one day before the wooden pin in the pizza cutter started falling out (CHOKING HAZZARD!!!!) and because I've missed my window of time to return it we are stuck with it :(	-1
We have the old version of this toy that was given to my son as a hand me down back in 2005 or so.  It has always been one of those toys that looks like a great idea but hasn't gotten all that much play in our house.  Right now it is in storage as I have 2yo twins and I think they might like it some day, but for now it's just too many pieces to pick up.  I keep wondering if I should just toss it - I came on here to see what other people think.  It's a neat idea - I just never saw it played with much here!  It has GOT to have a lid, though.  Melissa and Doug products have really gotten worse over time - the veggie cutting box for example used to have a lid  No more.  The pattern blocks have no lid - I got around that by keeping the blocks in a container that fits in the frame.  But it should have a lid.  And this should TOTALLY have a lid - there are just too many pieces!  I would rather M&D charge a buck or two more (come on - plexiglass is cheap!) than put out products that look like they should store well but don't.  I almost want to say boycott them until they bring back lids!  :-)  Anyway overall really not that great a toy - and there's no way I would buy it new, now, with no lid.	-1
My mother purchased this for our little ones, 2 and 3. It does not stand up for long, the kids just lean against it and it is on its side, and I constantly have to stand it up. It is reeally flimsy. The kids seem to enjoy it, but fight over it when it tips.	-1
My grandson loves Thomas the tank, so I thought this would be great for my house.  He already has has a pop up teepee and a tent at his house.  Because it has no floor in it, it flips over easily if he hits his head on the lower section. He is only 16 months old, so the lower section is pretty low.  It is very difficult to take down and takes up a lot of space. I never did get it back in it's storage sack.  Hopefully, we will have more success with it in the summer when it can be used outside.	-1
This is an expensive idea....6 blocks is what you get, and 6 blocks aren't enough..... not even for my 1 year old, nor my 3.5 year old (both boys). We'd need to buy an additional 2 more sets just to get started, and that is another $60!  Honestly, they are bigger & bulkier in person.  If they were a bit smaller and came with 8 or 10 blocks, then they would be more useful. Guidecraft makes a better block set with the exact same design. I'm going to buy it to add to this useless set....  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Guidecraft-Rainbow-Blocks-10-Piece-Set/dp/B00292XV6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Guidecraft Rainbow Blocks 10 Piece Set</a>	-1
This toy requires the child to pump the handle in order to shoot the balls out.  The only person in the house that has fun with this is my husband, as he is the only one that can use it with little effort.	-1
It was impossible for my 8 year old grandson to operate this toy.  The foam balls fit so tightly in the chamber that it takes Herculean strength to get them to pop out.  He had to hold the blaster against his abdomen and use both hands to try to fire the balls, and he still couldn't do it.  Even the adults present had a hard time with it.  Nerf toys have always been pretty good, but pick another model or style of Nerf blaster. All this toy does is aggravate the user.	-1
I am not happy that you can't wash them.  They get dirty over time and you just have to pitch them or keep using them as is.  I wish they had been easier to clean.  My baby only liked the when he was in the phase where they chew on everything.  For stacking, they really aren't so great.	-1
I expected more from this toy.  There is only one rattle sound and it is not very loud, my 6 month old I can't shake it hard enough to hear the rattle.  My child has no interest in the flaps on the blocks.	-1
Holes. So disappointed!!! Ordered this for my seven month old. Sad.	-1
The triominos are very small. We play this game all the time with our granddaughters. Even they didn't like this set.  I would have returned them, but that's more work than these were worth. Very disappointing.	-1
Got this for my 9 yr old son. He's not interested in it. My 7 yr old daughter plays it, but it is certainly not our favorite game to play.	-1
Oh boy, it was good until the 2nd day and there was a hole... I could not patch it up, and had to throw it away.	-1
Sombody gave me one for my first born. We loved it, so when 2nd bb came 6 years after we bought one again. Now 6 years later we have bb number 3 so we bought our 3rd one same brand and all but this new version doesnt quack when u squeeze the bill so sad that was the best part! Also seems smaller now!	-1
Too small to use with my 8month only.  Disappointed I can't use it at all	-1
Most of the questions are about what you'd expect to amuse a second grader. Some are just inappropriate. Example: One of the dare cards wants you to greet another player like a dog would greet another dog (sniffing nose to backside). Really?  Also, the slime was dried out so the most fun part of the game is missing. (It's supposed to be stretched like snot from a nostril along a number scale to keep score.)	-1
I wish this tub didn't have a giant head.  I bought it because the reviews were better than other inflatable baby tubs.  But, we have one tiny bathroom and the head of this tuck is just totally unnecessary and in the way.  If I were to do it over, I'd buy one without a head.  I love that it has a grippy bottom and a drain.  But there's a seam around the bottom with extra clear plastic that traps food.  (I strip Baby down to practice eating solids and take her straight to the bath.)  5/26/2017: We've been using this tub for 3-4 months and there's a leak in the giant, unsightly head.  I can't find it.  It deflates every night.  I'm replacing it with a headless tub.  I docked two more stars for lack of longevity and heartiness.  6/29/2017: I bought another brand inflatable whale to replace the first failed duck.  It was too small and incredibly difficult to blow up.  I even decapitated the first duck head and duct taped over it because I had to send the whale back - I got a lot of laughs from family about that.  I ordered a second duck out of desperation.  Our rental bathtub is just not suitable for a small child and we are stuck here for the time being.  A big positive for this tub is the inflatable bottom with the channels - it really helps water to drain from the tub while baby is still in it.  My baby likes to watch the water go down and then we collect her toys and put them away.  Another positive is that there's no inflatable pillows or cup holders that will trap water and will DEFINITELY grow mold in Houston TX.  A huge negative for this tub is the ridiculously large head - I really encourage Munchkin to make a simple inflatable tub.  Please.  I bought this second tub on 6/5 and sadly it's developed another small leak.  Maybe when Munchkin makes a simpler design, they can make the plastic a bit thicker and more durable.  I just haven't had the durable experience other reviewers seem to have had.  I don't know what's up, but it's totally frustrating to have to firm up this tub again every night.  Pictured is where we store it in our single minuscule 1940s bathroom.	-1
Broke	-1
Was a pain to blow up and deflate. Has a strong chemica smell. I bought it for traveling and my baby didn't like it one bit.	-1
I had to pump air into this little ducky bath everyday. Not satisfied	-1
not very durable	-1
The smell from this product smelled very toxic so we have used the kitchen sink instead	-1
Too small	-1
Cool idea, but it was way too small for a functional bath. My six month old did not fit in this very well. We returned it.	-1
When My husband showed it out baby , he started crying and hold on really tight on my husband and turning his head away . He's completly afraid of it . When I tried putting him in he stares screaming and crying . Plus it even smells gross like plastic or chemicals.	-1
*UPDATED REVIEW APRIL 20,2015* After going through 2 of these ducks in a 7 month period, I am updating my review to 3 stars. I LOVE the concept, look and practicality of this tub (as stated in my original review), but I have had 2 duck tubs deflate on me in a short period of time. It started off small and barely noticeable and within 1-2 months of owning this tub, it ends up being more and more deflated between uses. We are now on our 2nd tub and to the point of having to blow it up every night prior to use. I could tasted Munchkin and didn't receive any response. Disappointed, because we loved our duck tub! Will not be repurchasing.  I purchased this duck tub as an alternative to the infant style bath tub that our little one was getting too big for.  There are some really great features to this tub!  Likes: -Size is great for little ones.  Allows baby to sit up and play with toys without toys floating away. -Textured bottom to help prevent baby from slipping all around. -Adorable duck style is fun for baby. -Temperature marker on the bottom to signal if water temp is too hot. -Easily inflatable. -Suction cups on bottom ensure the duck won't slip around in tub.  My only complaint is that after a couple months of owning, it seems to be losing its ability to stay inflated.  We use this tub nightly and now each night it has to be partially reinflated.  It's also getting worse as time goes on which likely means we'll have to purchase a replacement soon.  I do recommend this tub for anyone needing a bath tub option for a little one that is too big for their infant tub, but not quite ready to sit solo in the adult tub.  It's a great price and the perfect choice!	-1
Really disappointed. A bonded seam split after only a few uses. Same problem as others posted.	-1
This was a pain to use as a baby bath in my opinion.  It ended up outside being used as a swimming pool, until it blew away....	-1
Sent back.. first it leaked and my 7 month old grandson was too big for this tub.. His feet his the end!	-1
This is difficult to blow up without a pump. I thought I would be able to take this on road trips but could not blow it up. Wasted $$	-1
We used this for one day and then gave it away.  It doesn't fit against the sides of the tub very well so my daughter, who normally splashes and plays in her tub, just looked really uncomfortable.  It was horribly awkward to fill up thanks to the giant duck head on one side and the tail on the other.  It was just a really poor design.  I had wanted an inflatable tub as something inbetween an infant hard plastic tub and the big bathtub for my very tall child.  This was not it.	-1
Had a Puj tub which I loved, and got this to transition us to our big tub.  Worked for about a month then sprung a leak.  If you are looking for a temporary solution, this works ok for awhile.  The temperature duck and the indicator on the tub worked for maybe 2 days.  Don't rely on them to tell you the temperature of the water!!!	-1
We bought this for my in-laws as a Christmas gift because the reviews seemed to say it was a good game. We have played it a few times thinking that maybe if we try again we'll enjoy it more. Did not enjoy. It wasn't worth it to try and return it, so we just kept it. IT sits in our cupboard. no recommended	-1
It's not regular Monopoly. Didn't find any fun playing it.	-1
This duck was more of a fun purchase we thought we would take with us when we travelled. We used it once, its kind of annoying to blow up each time you want to use it and it just really isn't practical. It's cheap so its not a big deal, we just wouldn't recommend buying it. Good quality overall, we like the temperature monitor to show if its too hot.	-1
Yes, totally adorable, fits nicely in regular sized tub, my daughter loved it. Our first one lasted approximately 3 months before it sprung several air leaks and we had to refill it with air daily. We were very careful with it, so the leaks seem to come from weak seams. We figured we simply had a lemon, and bought a second one. That one also lasted about 3 months, same air leaks. Now they are going to sit in a landfill, which doesn't sit right with us. The second star is only because my daughter was so smitten with the design. I would rather pay much more for something better made. We recently bought a collapsible Karibu tub - yes, more expensive, but MUCH more durable and small space friendly.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Karibu-Folding-Bath-Blue/dp/B0073WXL4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Karibu Folding Bath - Blue</a>	-1
I bought this for my 6 month old who outgrew her infant tub. I returned it less than 24 hours later. It was not as large as I expected and not stable at all. My daughter is very active and this tub just did not work for us. There really is no "headrest" and as soon as you put even lukewarm water in it the hot indicator will change. Would not recommend-at all!	-1
Cheap and doesn't really mimic an accordian.	-1
I was very excited to get this. that faded quick.  my son is 9 months and sits very very good on his own. If the duck does not fit very snug in your tub, the sides will bend down with my 25lb baby's weight on it. I will only use this while away from home, to ensure his health from a tub not be clean enough. I will not use it everyday.  I LOVE Safety 1st Tub side Bath Seat	-1
It spring multiple leaks.  I do not know how, but its sooo annoying having to blow it back up after each use.  I did love it, and my son is now 2!	-1
The wheels on the front of the cart turn sideways and prevent it from rolling. My daughter can rarely get the cart to roll properly and thus rarely plays with it. I wish we had bough a different cart that is less frustrating to push.	-1
I liked this one because it was not pink as I was purchasing it for my two sons.  However, it continually falls apart and now the wheels don't work very well.  I would recommend spending a bit more money and purchasing something more durable.  I wish I would have done that.	-1
I bought this cart for my then 2 1/2y.o. daughter for Christmas 2006.  She very much enjoyed playing with it for the few months that it lasted.  While it was very cute, light enough for a toddler and easy to put together, it was made of very cheap material.  Without any abuse or misuse by my daughter, it bent so that it is now permanently lopsided and is no longer fun or easy to push.  My daughter never tried to climb in it or overload it with heavy objects.  It is simply poorly quality and not made to last.  I would recommend shelling out the extra dollars for one of the more sturdy carts.	-1
I got this as a gift for my new baby, but my toddler (age 2) was more interested in it and even she got bored with it quickly.  This toy is a heavy, vibrating hunk of plastic with flexible "wings" on the sides.  I guess baby could chew and teethe on the wings if she could lift the thing up to her face more easily.  The battery went dead after a few months.  It does three things, vibrate, play classical music, and light up (the eyes have red lights in them).  Big deal.  This is probably the most useless toy we have in our house.	-1
My son is almost 8 months old and is working on two teeth.  When I saw this toy I thought it might be the answer.  He didn't like it from the beginning.  It is really heavy and kind of bulky. It vibrates so hard if you lay it down it moves around like a beeper.  He hated it so much we took it back the very next day.	-1
sound quality very bad - upon taking it out of the box it had an odd sound - almost as if it had been damaged in some way - definitely overrated and I expected a much higher quality product.	-1
