I listen to this song all the time. More great beach country from Chesney. It makes you feel young and in puppy love again. Kenny took his music off of Spotify, so this is a great way to listen to it.	1

Fun, mello, "Crazy Love", is another fine Buble hit.	1
Oh My Love is a great song. It is a definite tearjerker. But, can be a nice break for a drummer (and possibly lead guitarist) if playing Rock Band.	1

After three years without giving his fans new material, recording artist Donell Jones returns with the single LOVE LIKE THIS. It takes you back to the vintage Jones that so many women fell in love with and guys could sing, finding a message that they could relate to with the ladies. If you're looking for real R&B, you need look no further than this.	1
I will admit to sharing fellow-reviewer Stanley Crowe's reservations about Grigolo's ability to project in a large house but having heard him last week as Nemorino at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, I was able to hear him beautifully from up in the gods and am now a convert. I commented sceptically on the enthusiastic welcome given this disc by another fellow reviewer , the Santa Fe Listener, but am again ready to recant and say that five years later I am convinced that Grigolo is managing his vocal and career development very wisely. Perhaps the continued dearth of really Italianate tenors has made me more susceptible to his gifts but I am now genuinely enthused about his ability to carry the torch.  The best things about his voice apart from its intrinsic beauty are his evenness of production, the way in which he inflects the music with musically acute details and the clarity of his diction. He has studied and acquired all the little vocal refinements which allow a singer to inject the note with emotion without being too overt about it; hence he has mastered the judicious use of portamento,  the acciaccatura, the messa di voce and the despatch of fioratura - all of which may be heard to perfection in the best track here from the same role in which I have just heard him live, "Una furtiva lagrima".  I was surprised that he opes this recital with an aria from a heavier, spinto tenor role but he manages it without strain and even returns to a second aria from "Un ballo in maschera"sings in track11. He does not here yet have quite the full weight of voice to do it full justice but his attention to colouring the text is exemplary. The programme includes several weightier arias alongside some standard bel canto numbers;hence early and middle period Verdi features, as does some heftier Puccini, as an indication of the direction he has gradually been taking since. In fact, there are only two Donizetti arias here;the rest are all from those two other composers.  While his voice does not have the distinctive ping of the young Pavarotti, he sounds far more pharyngeal and virile than Bocelli - and I like his chutzpah in throwing in a high C sharp at the end of the aria from "Il corsaro". I look forward to bigger and better - but all in good time as he is still three years off forty as I write.  (PS: the three supporting comprimario voices who make brief appearances in two tracks are absolutely dire - why?)	1

Nice CD, prompt delivery.	1

The follow up to her wildly addictive debut White Sugar this album by British blues rock guitarist Joanne Shaw Taylor does a number of things. Firstly it expands her repertoire considerably and presumably her live shows will be able to be more fleshed out. Secondly this album has her showing a bit more restraint in terms of the guitar solos and she also uses more of a whispering vocal style in parts which is different if not actually a good thing.  Obviously when you come out of the blocks with a debut as good as Ms Taylor did the follow up won't hit people as hard and this album doesn't. But it has a danker feel of grit to it than the aforementioned debut and that isn't a bad thing. Issues arise however with the whispering vocals that fade into obscurity at times, songs that just don't sparkle like those of the debut and the guitar tones sought here seem obtusely thicker without necessarily obtaining extra gravitas as part of the deal.  Highlights on this album would have to be the slow starting first track, Can't Keep Living Like This, Dead and Gone and the title track. Dead and Gone in particular sounds like it would be out of place on the first tune with the guitar and vocal riding a melody that is both plaintive and upbeat at the same time with a tasty fade out solo.	1
A great record which should better analysed	1
Excellent	1
Man, oh man!!!! Has Ronnie paid all these reviewers to give all these blatantly false five star reviews? Even at his best moments, he NEVER was anything close to great, and years of working for Jagger and Richards for the paycheck did not improve his basic skills at all!  This album is absolute crap, guitar wise and vocal wise. Atrocious, uninspired, false to the bone.	-1
VASTLY UNDERRATED TITAN's Sonatas, Serenade, Symphonies, Dances, Poem, etc., for under a buck.  HURRY, Listen fast, listen long!	1
This was en excellent purchase!  Thank You.	1
Love this music.	1
Dvorak's 9th preformed by the Berliner Symphonic Orchestra along with many more fantastic pieces. My favorite!	1
Most oif these "classical collections" are repeative, however at 99 Cents they are a bargin.  One has to sort through them and arrange some playlsits according to personal preferences, but all it all I would recommend them.  ... "New World Alone is worth it!!!!"	1
I bought this to add to a massive classical playlist for my son to listen too. I'm amazed how cheap classical music is compared to other genres. a great value to say the least	1

One of my favorite Judy Collins Songs.	1
I do like this sung which is based on Old Testament scripture and I have always liked it.  I am glad I was able to download it along with other personal favorites without having to buy the entire CD.  I agree that for everything there is a season. I do enjoy Judy Collins voice and singing style, which makes this a song to enjoy and think about as well.	1

Really great title, interesting  music, very thoughtful written and produced, Wonderful tracks, recommended listening.	1
very good quality, price & delivery, well done!	1

I downloaded this for free, and for the price, this is an enjoyable addition to my collection of Christmas music that I load onto my iPod each Christmas season and delete right after Christmas. If it is still free, definately try it. If you have to pay for it, make sure it meets your tastes in music first.	1
This is a great song that brings back the traditions and, more importantly, the true meaning of the holy season of Christmas.	1
Dimitri Mitropoulos was a superb conductor who has been somewhat forgotten nowadays. He led the NYPO for several years from the late 40's to the late 50's, with the great Leonard Bernstein following him. Mitropoulos had a brilliant way of conducting modern music that wasn't heard too often back then, with a conducting style that was once compared to a "Byzantine monk furiously shaking martinis". One of the composers he excelled in was Gustav Mahler, back when Mahler was rarely heard. This is a live performance of the "Tragic" sixth symphony from April 10th, 1955. It is very, very, good, if a bit flawed in a few places. For one thing, the sound quality is surprisingly good for a live recording from the mid 50's. But, there is a patch of some kind of electrical hiss or whirl in the fourth movement. Maybe it's the download or it's the original recording, but it's very annoying. Fortunately, it only lasts about 2 or 3 minutes. The audience is not too intrusive with coughing and such.   As for the actual performance, it's fantastic. The work moves at a nice pace and sounds like the sixth should at almost all the right spots. The second and third movements are presented as andante followed by the scherzo. You know, one way you can always tell a true Mahler fan apart is to ask them the question "Which do you prefer, scherzo before andante, or andante before scherzo?" A true fan will know just what you mean, and then be emphatic on their opinion of the order of those movements. I have always preferred the Scherzo before the andante, perhaps because that's the way I first heard the symphony. You know what they say about first impressions. Plus, I feel IMHO that you need that long, beautiful andante to come before the nearly 30 minute finale. The metabolism, or "Blood Pressure" if you will, of the work needs to slow and calm down in order to prepare both you and itself for that finale. Could you imagine Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the molto vivace scherzo coming right before the Ode to Joy finale, and not the slow movenent? The same goes for Bruckner's Symphony No. 8 or Mahler's Fourth. Now I can't damn the performance or recording because of this. It's a personal preference, and of course andante before scherzo does work for a lot of Mahlerites.   In the end, this recording is for die-hard Mahler fans. Or die-hard Mitropoulos fans. If you want a good first recording of the sixth, try Pierre Boulez and the VPO on DG, which is the best version I've ever heard. George Szell also does great version with the Cleveland Orchestra, now out of print I think. As for Bernstein, the second version, on DG from the 80's is also a must have.--------------PEACE	1
Absolute spine-tingling interpretation of the Sixth! It was a revelation to me, and I have heard many Sixths! I had never heard Mitropoulos' Mahler until now, and he captures the drama and tragedy of this amazing work, Mahler's most "classical" symphony (4 movements with inner slow and scherzo movements) and yet most anti-classical symphony! My first experience of the Sixth was Bernstein's Columbia recording of 1967. That recording sold me on Mahler as my favorite composer. Now having heard this recording, I must say this ranks in the top 2 or 3 recordings of the work! The monaural sound, from a live 1955 performance, has been beautifully remastered and sounds incredible in the 192 kb/sec mp3 download that I own (not the present CD). This is highly dramatic and exciting Mahler! Get this album!	1
Previous reviewers have already covered the obvious merits of this live performance and broadly agree except perhaps regarding the extent to which the NYPO plays accurately. I have to say that apart from a few minor burbles from the trumpet and horns which remain perfectly acceptable in a live, I am amazed by the unanimity of their drive and attack; Mitropoulos galvanises them into giving a truly ferocious account of the stretti passages in the first and final movements and they are very sharp in following both the conductor's beat and the frequent switches in rhythm and time signatures characteristic of Mahler's scores. It is clear that Bernstein by no means had it all to do in familiarising this orchestra with Mahler in the sixties; his mentor had obviously already rained and enthused them.  The only reason to regret the slightly raw and quite resonant mono sound is in the huge, tutti climaxes of the finale, when Mitropoulos generates an extraordinarily glorious cacaphony as the titanic struggle between optimism and despair unfolds; otherwise the acoustic, by accentuating the typically strident whistle of the violins when they are playing high up on the bridge, if anything, adds to the excitement. However, Mitropoulos knows when to let the music swoon and sigh and again prompts me to wonder just how influential he was in informing Bernstein's own style in Mahler.  There is some radio whistle a few minutes into that finale and the audience are a bit restive up top that point, too, but both irritations pass and Mitropoulos keeps the screws on to the bitter end - and indeed it is, deeply dark and forlorn.  I have an entirely irrelevant and personal reason for favouring this recording; it happens to have been made on the same Easter Sunday over sixty years ago when I first saw the light of day...	1
My copy of this powerful live Mahler Sixth is a download, so I can only surmise that tis is the same Mitropoulos reading that appears in the deluxe box set of Mahler broadcasts released by the New York Phil. in 1999: there it is listed as Carnegie Hall. April 10th, 1955.  I share the lead reviewer's enthusiasm, especially because the only other Mitropoulos Sixth in my collection is wretchedly played by the Cologne WDR orchestra.  But I must disagree with the lead reviewer about the precision of this New York performance. The first trumpet barely squeezes out the exposed high note at the beginning (it must be treacherous, since in a live reading by Karajan and the Berliners the first trumpet actually misses the same note). Other mistakes, such as the occasional struggling horns in the finale,  are minor, to my ears at least, and overall the execution is miles ahead of what we heard from Cologne. Like Hermann Scherchen and Jascha Horenstein, Mitropoulos managed to be great and sloppy at the same time.  the lead reviewer considers the tempo for the andante to be unusually slow, but at 15:02, Mitropoulos's pacing is a minute slower than Bernstein and two minutes slower than Karajan, both on DG. Where he is certainly right, though, is in the spontaneity and intensity of this recording. At his best Mitropoulos was a passionate conductor with a sense of real aliveness, like is protege Bernstein. Yet there is a sense of poise, also, making Bernstein's two readings more impetuous overall. Mitropoulos takes the opening march in the first movement at an almost stately pace, closer to Barbirolli than to those who take Bernstein's cue and drive the beat home with crushing immediacy and threat. The Scherzo is quick and forceful; by contrast Tennstedt is far more harrowing in his recent live reading with the London Phil.  the tendency to underline Mahler's emotional extremes was much less present in Mitropoulos's day, and what seemed biting then is fairly normal now -- which isn't to take away from the spontaneity and excitement of his Scherzo.  In the finale Mitropoulos doesn't go for the nerve-racking intensity of Bernstein and (especially) Tennstedt, allowing quite a few moments of relaxed rhythm and measured pacing. But it's all in the service of a slow build that finds the right moment to crest in terrifying outcries. Some may feel that however great a performance, the Mahler sixth needs full spectrum stereo. Here we have excellent, well-balanced mono without microphone distortion or a radio producer riding the gain during climaxes (not that noticeably, at least).  I had no trouble finding the version at hand, from the Archipel label, not the one pictured here, quite listenable. I even wonder if this French off-label didn't pirate the NY Phil. source.  At this moment used copies of the complete Mahler broadcasts sell for $450, so being able to attain a decent-sounding version of tis famous Sixth is a boon. It fully justifies its reputation.	1

My grandaughter loves Big Time Rush, so I got this for her, but I like it too.  If you are familiar with the series, you know it's kind of a modern-day Monkees with the same likeable vibe and enjoyable music.  The boys are cute and they can sing a bit too.	1
This song is cool and it is the theme song for the television show. It is a cute song though.	1
Usually opening theme songs are just decent. I think this is more than just decent. It's all about living a happy life and having fun.	1
Well, Sony has created the new "monkies" I suppose. I find the show horried, but the music is fun. But is this all they've got.. is the next question? I hope they get a playlist together. Soon. Possibly by summer if all goes well with the Nick show.	1

I am late as a fan of this performer and glad I came on board. A different type of voice that also has soul. Hopefully she will produce more music to enjoy.	1
This is such a lovely song, and Corinne Bailey Rae has an incredible voice, I have become hooked on her music and continue to purchase more of her songs.	1
I love this song and played it all the time on my iPod.  I recommend it for anyone who loves music.	1

This is a fun song.  The Band Perry lets out some pretty good songs.  I like this one and I think we can all relate to that in-love feeling between real vs. hopeful love.	1
I love this song, as with all of The Band Perry's music. I just enjoy the enthusiasm of this young group	1
I love this song, and amazon makes it totally worth it because unlike stupid iTunes, you can keep downloading it to a new phone, or redownload it if your internet dies or something in the middle of the download, all for free. See iTunes, if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load, or your power goes out, or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again, trust me, I experienced that huge problem with iTunes MORE THAN ONCE. Where as Amazon is awesome cause it's all on your account, so you just log in and it's there, and it shows that you payed the $1 for it so it's yours. Even if you get a new phone, or iPod, or loose internet connection or whatever... your logged it, it's your account you payed for it, its all leagle, and it's yours, for like EVER. :D And (like I said above) if you loose internet connection you can retry the download unlike iTunes :D In my own PERSONAL opinion I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMEND you download songs, and buy songs from Amazon.com verses buying it on iTunes. c:	1

Like many people, I bought several Badfinger numbers after viewing the finale of Breaking Bad.	1
Started listening to Badfinger songs again after hearing "Baby Blue" on Breaking Bad.  This classic rock song is an excellent tune, with great guitar riffs from the 70's era.  Glad we bought it--a song we can listen to over and over.	1
I was looking through the rest of your MP3 list and this was one of the songs I found. Good to have it.	1

They had all the ingredients for a great song. I came and got it maybe 30 years or so ago when it first came out. Loved it then; still love it but now with digital I can play it anytime I want it. Badfinger had a great sound. Still sounds great.	1
...wasn't a very good movie, but the Badfinger song Come And Get It is a great song from the movie.  I realized in 2013 that I didn't have it in my computer music collection and went to Amazon and downloaded it.  I think it came out around 1970...	1

Michael Buble.  Enough said.	1
It's nice to hear someone not singing Hollywood's praises for once and even better to hear Michael Buble doing it. It's an older song, but its message rings true.	1
I've come to really enjoy Michael Buble's contemporary music and purchased a few tracks. Nothing wrong with the remakes of older songs, but I like the catchy blending of the older style and contemporary sound.	1

Highly recommend.  Great song that I enjoy.  Also try "It's About TIme" and "My Body,"  All great songs from a band newly discovered by me.	1
Okay, so maybe it is the sadistic side to me, but I love to rock and bounce down the road to this song! Why? Ohh, cause it scares the other drivers on the road. Great fast beat, easy to move to, and the lyrics are good too. It sounds pretty good playing from my back pocket as I clean around the house too. LoL	1
ABiCA who have been on the music underground for a few years now, even releasing 3 albums along the way, but it is with this release "Numb" that is now taking the band out of the underground scene and into the mainstream! "Numb" which is also considered the bands first official release is a blend of many styles from rap, hip hop, rock and even dance. If you thought you knew ABiCA with their previous releases then this album is gonna hit you hard as it's a giant leap in quality.  Hash and Tac who are the two mcs/vocalists in ABiCA have a great interplay style, it helps that they both have distinct voices and don't sound like each other. The album opens with the soft sound of piano keys on title track "Numb" before the vocals kick in, it's a brave move for a band to start a debut album on such a quiet note, in reality it's just easing you into the next 55 minutes of varying styles. "Tell Us Why" comes bouncing out with heavy beats and industrial sounding guitars as Tac and Hash are joined by Binary Audio who were two thirds of the British band Radiator, Janne Jarvis joins on vocals and the song has a real Nine Inch Nails style to it. "Turn Me On" has a great interplay of vocals and keeps the album flowing into "My Song" which features former memeber Cant on vocals, the track is a hip hop delight and will keep longtime ABiCA fans happy. The track features a cool loop throughout the track.  "The things You Think I Say" features Approaching Nirvana on vocals and he gives the song a Linkin Park laid back sound. "The Pursuit" sounds like vintage "Licensed To Ill" Beastie Boys. "Take This Away" starts with a haunting piano and has Hash delivering some heavy lines as Tac sings in the background, it's a perfect example of both members varying styles working rally well. On "I Can Be Real" ABiCA get real heavy, with some big drums and heavy guitars, the song is produced by Tweaker Ray who has mixed many a Nine Inch nails song himself, his production qualities really shine on the track.  ABiCA even give us a big dance sounding track on "Gave Em A Reason" a track that features a big chorus. Former member Cant appears again on "Blurry". The final track "What You See" is a rock stomper with Tac leading the vocal duties, it's a great way to finish off the album. The only complaint you can really level at the album is that at 16 songs it might be too long, especially for a debut and considering the short attention span climate we now live in.  With "Numb" ABiCA have set the mark high for their next album, which should be ready to go by late 2011 early 2012. It's amazing to think the Tac and Hash have produced and released their own album, the sound quality is great as good as you would get on any major record label release, the artwork is cool with detailed information on who produced and engineered what as well as what the guest performers roll in each track was. ABiCA have drawn many comparisons to Linkin Park, Nine Inch Nails, Eminem and the Beastie Boys, for me they sound a bit like Pop Will Eat Itself "Dos Dedos Mis Amigos" era a former English band who featured Black Swan composer Clint Mansell on Vocals. ABiCA are determined to get their name out there, and even on Hash's album notes he encourages you to share the album with other people. ABiCA "Numb" deserves to be heard by a wide audience!!	1

ABiCA have drawn many comparisons to Linkin Park, Nine Inch Nails, Eminem and the Beastie Boys, for me they sound a bit like Pop Will Eat Itself "Dos Dedos Mis Amigos" era a former English band who featured Black Swan composer Clint Mansell on Vocals. ABiCA are determined to get their name out there, and even on Hash's album notes he encourages you to share the album with other people. ABiCA "Numb" deserves to be heard by a wide audience!!	1
I was sent a copy of Abica's third album, Numb, without ever having heard this band's music before. It took a few listens for me to truly grasp this band, but in the end I found Numb to be a very competent effort from a band that quite plainly has a bright future ahead of them.  The music teeters between full-on hip-hop/rap to alternative rap/rock reminiscent of Limp Bizkit and old Linkin Park. Layers of synths swirl alongside heavy guitars and drums to create an energetic soundscape that completely carries this album. The production on the record is top-notch, and some of the best instrumentation I've heard in this genre. Furthermore, the album has just the right amount of variety to keep it interesting. At sixteen tracks, you may think it'll be a bit on the long side, but the songs sound different enough that you will never feel the length. Standout tracks include "Tell Us Why", "The Things You Think I Say", "Take This Away", "Gave Em A Reason", "Never That Far Away" and "What You See". I must especially single out "Gave Em A Reason" as probably the best track on this album. It's a high-energy thrasher that keeps going till the very end. On a side-note, from hearing the record I would imagine Abica's live shows to be some of the most energetic and intense around!  Unfortunately, the album does stumble in a few places. Lyrically, it's hit or miss. Not that the lyrics are bad, far from it, but they sometimes feel a bit overly simplistic. It's striking since it's such a stark contrast from the meticulously-crafted music behind them. A prime example of this is "Beautiful", which despite the brilliant backdrop ends up being a rather generic hook-up song. Another head-scratcher is "Blurry", which is an awkward reconstruction of the song "24" by Jem (with no mention of original songwriters Jem Griffiths and Justin Griffiths in the linear notes). It's not a remake, the music, beat and chorus share the same melody with "24" but the lyrics are original. I personally felt the song lacks the punch of Jem's version and ends up the weakest point on the record. Also, and this isn't really criticism, around two times on the album there is some very melodic singing during the song's bridge. I would really like to hear more of that! Not that the rapping and raspy vocals are bad, but the singing just added a little uplift that gave those songs a little more depth.  But ultimately, Numb's numerous strengths far outweigh its few drawbacks. Abica has created a strong and robust album that's sure to please fans and invite new ones. I really enjoy this album, and I definitely look forward to future releases. I'm anxious to see how this band grows and evolves in the years to come.	1

Numb by Abica was a hard album for me to review. The band sent me a promo CD and I've listened to it a number of times trying to figure out how a feel about it. It isn't a style I normally listen to, so I want to be as objective as possible. The music doesn't want you to be objective though. It wants you to feel and get deep down into it.  If forced to classify it, rap-rock with and industrial influence is as close as I can come. I think Tac and Hash are really trying to something unique here. In some instances they succeed wonderfully while in others they fall back in to cliche. Their rap interplay works well yet their singing voices leave a little to be desired. The big strength of Numb is its the lyrics. Very well thought out, you really get into their heads. These songs are brimming with emotion, though I'd say the predominant one is angst. The F-bomb gets dropped frequently, but it only serves to emphasize the more meaningful lyrics.  Musically I really dig most of Abica's songs. There are some very cool things going on in the songs and repeat listens are needed to pick out some of the more subtle stuff. I'd compare them to Trent Reznor, but their studio wizardry isn't quite to that level. Yet. It is well on it's way and very listenable. I'd just like to hear a bit more dynamic range and a slightly less "processed" sound. While Abica covers a wide range of topics and a few different styles, in the end it one song comes out sounding a bit like the next. But if you want strong beats, emotionally driven lyrics and catchy hooks, then maybe that isn't such a bad thing. It has grown on me and I am willing to bet that album #2 takes things to the next level.  Standouts for me:  What You See Numb My Song Blurry The Things You Think I Say Take This Away Never That Far Away Nothing Here Beautiful Gave Em A Reason	1

very much me i do love women that can make there own way	1
Great song to inspire people &help them through their day by listening to  MY SHOW ON KGLP.ORG  Don't worry, be happy! show.	1
This song says it all, describes me to a T. I loved this song when I first heard it, finally maybe some men will start taking women seriously. This song as a strong message to it, why it took so long for a song like this to get out beats me. The reason why I liked it is because some just think of women as trophies and not very serious. I'm glad this song came out and the message is a good 1.  Thanks, Kris L. CocKayne	1
This is a very catchy and inspirational tune on what it means to be self-reliant. I remember the song when it first came out because it was being promoted for the newer version of the Charlie's Angels Movie (Charlie's angels is even quoted in the song). I like the positive theme to the song about learning to always be independent in all areas of your life, and of it being 50/50 in relationships. The song sends a positive message to avoid depending on others to give you what you want, and to instead find ways to obtain your desires through your own means (the group cleverly does this by using lyrics such as "the shoes on my feet, I bought it", and with mentioning how they even paid for the place they live in). This is also a good song to listen to for putting oneself in a prosperous state of mind.  Overall, this is definitely a song to listen to if you like any of Beyonce's songs and/or any music from Destiny's Child.	1

I love this song Long Live by Taylor Swift it's excellent. In watching Taylor's Journey from Fearless to the present what I feel is what Taylor went through. She is a beautiful, strong, confident woman. She is fearless she broke through barriers, walls, to get where she is. Talented, successful Artist, above all honest so, humble, grateful a great role model for everyone. I'm a huge fan Taylor your awesome. Valerie Lambert	1
This song is one that gives me great strength. I feel awesome after listening to it (about 10 times)!	1
I came across this song while I was watching youtube videos for the BBC Show Merlin. WONDERFUL SERIES! It stuck in my head, and I downloaded it, so I didn't have to keep pushing replay on the video to hear it ;)	1
This song is my new favorite; it makes me think of all the good times I had when I was a kid playing make-believe games with my best friends, and speaks of the hope that we never grow apart and forget each other.	1
Starting off slow, this song turns into a power house song once the chorus comes. This song is VERY well written. It's about her times with her band, her producer, and her fans always cheering her on. Definitely one of her best from Speak Now, along with Enchanted, Speak Now, Better than Revenge, Mean and Story of Us.  This song reminds me of Harry Potter too.	1
Easy to listen to.  Not her best, but good.  Can see why it's popular.	1
love this album. worth it!	1

When Billy Vaughn's mono 1958 DOT Records LP of CHRISTMAS CAROLS (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/DLP-3148/dp/B000LH2AKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">DLP 3148</a>) was reissued a year later in stereo (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/DLP-25148/dp/B00DS997ZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">DLP 25148</a>), a small red STEREOPHONIC sticker was added to the LP's original front cover.  SIDE ONE [3:00] White Christmas [2:30] It Came Upon a Midnight Clear [2:25] O Holy NIght [1:35] Deck the Halls [1:45] The First Nol [2:25] Joy to the World [2:14] Adeste Fideles  SIDE TWO [2:03] Silent Night [1:45] God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen [1:38] O Tannenbaum [2:42] Hark! The Herald Angels Sing [2:30] Faith of Our Fathers [1:36] Jingle Bells [2:30] O Little Town of Bethlehem  TOTAL TIME: 30:38	1
It's surprising how many classic Christmas LPs have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD, none more so than Christmas Carols by Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra which first came out in 1958 as mono Dot 3148 containing: White Christmas; It Came Upon A Midnight Clear; O Holy Night; Deck The Halls; The First Noel; Joy To The World; Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful); Silent Night; God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen; O Tannenbaum (O Christmas Tree); Hark! The Herald Angels Sing; Faith Of Our Fathers; Jingle Bells; O Little Town Of Bethlehem.  Over the years with subsequent reissues there were 3 different covers with the original having a mostly yellow cover and a stylized drawing of a sleigh inside a large red oval (which made it a bit odd in that Sleigh Ride itself was not among the tracks). In 1959 the same album came out in stereo (Dot 3148/25148), with a glossy front cover, "Billy Vaughn" in white on a green background and gold-embossed "Christmas Carols" on red, with a gold embossed border. When re-issued again a few years later the cover was a flat red, the "Dot" logo in its usual 3 colors situated in a green circle, "Billy Vaughn" in white and "Christmas Carols" in yellow. Charting-wise it made it to # 145 on Billboard's Christmas charts in 1962 and # 101 in 1967.  Some of the tracks have appeared on these CDs: Christmas With Billy Vaughn & His Yuletide Orchestra - 9 of the same tracks in a 10-track 2006 release that includes Auld Lang Syne; Christmas Classics, a 1996 release from Chicago Music Company that contains the same 10 sides; and Christmas Song, a 2012 release from Essential Media Group containing the same line-up. None of these include God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen or White Christmas, nor can I say with any certainty that they are all the same original 1958 renditions.  Why that has never been re-mastered for CD is a puzzle since Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra wasn't just some run-of-the-mill band back then. After being part of the highly-successful Dot vocal quartet known as The Hilltoppers, who had 15 hit singles for the label from 1952 to 1954, he left to form the in-house Dot orchestra in 1954 that would go on to back the vast majority of Dot artists on so many hit singles and albums (e.g. Pat Boone, Gail Storm, The Fontane Sisters, Tab Hunter, Nick Todd (Pat Boone's brother), and many more for years to come.  In the midst of all that, he and his orchestra would rack up some 31 hit singles of their own from their first, Melody Of Love in late 1954/early 1955, to their last in 1967, I Love You (And You Love Me), while selling albums in the millions, 4 of which went Gold: The Golden Instrumentals (1956); Sail Along Silv'ry Moon (1958); Blue Hawaii (1959); and Theme From A Summer Place (1960).  A great deal of his music is available on CD, so why are they dragging their heels with his premier Christmas album?	1

I've been sorting through boxes of old Christmas albums and commenting on most that are listed here at Amazon, lamenting the fact that many have never been re-mastered for conversion to CD, since these were the ones us old duffers recall most fondly. But my surprise at some of the ones overlooked now has a Number 1 in my book: Christmas Carols by Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra which first came out in 1958 as mono Dot 3148 containing: White Christmas; It Came Upon A Midnight Clear; O Holy Night; Deck The Halls; The First Noel; Joy To The World; Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful); Silent Night; God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen; O Tannenbaum (O Christmas Tree); Hark! The Herald Angels Sing; Faith Of Our Fathers; Jingle Bells; O Little Town Of Bethlehem.  That original album had the yellow cover seen here with a stylized drawing of a sleigh ride inside a large red oval (which made it a bit odd that Sleigh Ride itself was not among the tracks). In 1959 the same album came out in stereo (Dot 3148/25148), and when re-issued a few years later with new covers, it made it to # 145 on Billboard's Christmas charts in 1962, and # 101 in 1967.  Some of these tracks have appeared on these CDs: Christmas With Billy Vaughn & His Yuletide Orchestra - 9 of the same tracks in a 10-track 2006 release that includes Auld Lang Syne (not part of the original); Christmas Classics, a 1996 release from Chicago Music Company that contains the same 10 sides; and Christmas Song, a 2012 release from Essential Media Group containing the same line-up. None of these include God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen or White Christmas, nor can I say with any certainty that they are all the same original 1958 renditions.

Four of those went Gold: The Golden Instrumentals (1956); Sail Along Silv'ry Moon (1958); Blue Hawaii (1959); and Theme From A Summer Place (1960).  A great deal of his music is available on CD, so why are they dragging their heels with his premier Christmas album?	1

Don Williams was a singer/songwriter/guitarist who was a major star in the world of country music during the 1970's and 1980's.  In fact, between 1974 and 1986 Don would amass an impressive total of 17 #1 hits on Billboard's Top Country Singles chart.  Despite all of his success as a country artist Don Williams could never seem to come up with the crossover hit that most country artists were always looking for.  Then in 1980 he recorded a ballad written by Roger Cook and Sam Hogin.  Don finally had his crossover hit.  "I Believe In You" spent an impressive 20 weeks on Billboard's Hit 100 pop charts peaking at #24 in November of that year.  Meanwhile, "I Believe In You" would also become Don's eleventh #1 country hit.  This is the original hit recording you would remember from the radio.  Good stuff!	1

5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library. With that said, I could explain all the reasons I love this, or. I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing. It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself. Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version. If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.  I was fortunate enough to catch this song when it was free on Amazon. Thats right! Amazon has a FREEBIE section with both songs AND albums. A great way to construct an entire music library, and admittedly, the way I obtained most of my own music. But quite honestly, a wonderful way to explore new music, too. In fact, some of the songs that Ive obtained through Amazon as freebies would eventually lead to me falling in love with a new band, and ultimately buying some of their other songs that happened to have a price tag. Anyway...enough of my rambling.  This song is great! At the very least, give it a 30-second listen?  And don't forget, if you are in the market for freebies, you can always check here  FREE SONGS: From Amazon Home page --> Shop by Department --> (Digital and Prime Music) Deals --> Songs by Price (on left side of screen)---> Free	1

Awful Quality for this song. I thought it would be better.	-1
I love this song. And the movie and before that the TV series,  I  have made a CD of this song and many other old and new family friendly songs for all of our road trip we take all summer long. Is a great CD when traveling with the grand kids for sure. We all sing the songs together and talk about our favorite parts of the movie or show the song comes from. We are making new memories associated with the songs on my traveling CD. Very nice to have when you cant get reception on the radio in some places and we never have to worry about songs being inappropriate for the kids. This was a great idea and so glad I thought of it. Happy travels for us, we will enjoy these songs for years to come. as many songs on it has been around for years already it is great to share with the kids	1
This has got to be one of the best songs from Bad Company. I am one that grew up on some 70's rock and a lot of 80's music. This album No Smoke Without A Fire came out in the 80's. I admit I do not know much about Bad Company, but this song rocks. It has great lyrics, with a tough sound. I would recommend it to anyone. A truly great song, listen to the MP3 sample, you will be hooked.	1
Great album	1
love the song,great mixing and recording	1
One of my old favorites.	1
this is another song by this band i remember hearing when i was younger . it was a nice addition to my player .	1
Awesome Song!!!	1
I have always loved Bad Company	1
Great album	1
I already own this CD, but it's so easy to download my favorite singles and listen to this on my iPad.  Holy Water is such a great song, and I love how the focus is on the music with groups like Bad Company, Foreigner, Boston, etc.  Even if it's because they may sound better than they look, to result all these years later is the power of the music comes through.  I love that.  Thanks for the great music.	1
One of favorites from Bad Company and that' s something saying that they go back to 1974, It all goes down to the way the vocals and everything else are recorded and mixed and they did an awesome job.	1
Sounds great!	1
Great song.	1
this was a song by a band that i grew up listening to off and on during the years . off and on depending on which radio station was on .	1
The chemistry that can be heard and seen during this song and the actual performance makes a fun and classic Christmas song new and refreshing. Darren Criss and Chris Colfer are amazing on this song and I couldn't imagine two other people on Glee being able to match this perfection. This is definitely one of my favorite Glee duets.	1
Helped open me up to a new world of music and I absolutely love the show and the songs they sing.	1
Awesome. Loved it. Listening to this was a wonderful way to celebrate the winter season and the holidays this past year. I truly loved the way Glee performed the song.	1
Love this song! Quick download and decent prices. I love storing music in the cloud! This is a great system!	1
Great album, Great sound Jamaica, Queens, New York native Lloyd Banks the best underrated artist the same as 50 Cent and all other New York music artist that makes the best sound. Hunger For More 2 is like the coolest album I ever listen from Lloyd Banks, from between Hunger For More that first album of his also cool as well.	1
Lloyd Banks has always been one of the better MC's in G-Unit but he doesn't get the recognititon for some reason. This album is even better than the first installment. The production is hard hitting & the features are some of the best. It's a good listen with my Beats headphones because the bass is deep & it just sounds great. Keep bankin it Banks!	1
This amusing song Candyman by Christina Aguilera is a creative mashup of what sounds to be vintage 40s music with a shrewd mix of dance/club music. Basically, this song Candyman seems to be the type of song about a man who is very socially popular to say the least. I first heard the Candyman song by Christina Aguilera by around the 2007/2008 timeframe.	1
So catchy!	1
It's fine fun even if the lyrics are a little filthy.	1
Love the words and the deep feelings this song evokes	1
X-TINA IS ONE OF OUR  BEST  SINGERS  TO DATE  , THAT GROWL N RASPY  VOICE  ND HER SINGING IS OFF THE CHARTS , LOVE HER ......	1

One of the most iconic songs by one of the most legendary singers of blues music ever. John Lee Hooker was one of those trailblazers of blues music that would go on to influence many of the great rock and roll singers and groups of the 1960's. With his gravelly voice and destrictive guitar playing "Boom Boom" is Hooker's most well known blues tune. A great song to listen to and download.	1

Loved most of these guys music since day one. I thought they were the Beatles when first heard them. Very creative rockers for their time.   Guitar player alert: if you can dial up the same thick distorted sounds these guys used, your on your way!	1
I always liked this group and their  songs	1
This song is what I would consider one of Classic Rock's early hits. If you are in the hunt for some Classic Rock music then might I suggest that you give this song a listen!!!.  DON'T WORRY, EVEN IF YOU JUST WANT A LITE TRACK, YOU STILL MIGHT LIKE THIS SONG, BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY HAS A LITTLE BIT OF HARD ROCK MIXED IN WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SOFT ROCK!!!.  Give it a listen and i'm sure that you will agree!!!.	1
No matter what... etc. etc... if you're a child of the 70's... it's a great album.  Love it.	1

This was Mary Hopkin's (British) first single release back in summer of 1968. It turned out to a major hit in both, the UK and the US. I immediately liked it a lot and bought the single in late fall of that year. It is a great song. The MP3 sound is just a little shy of being perfect, but it is good enough for my purposes.	1
Mary Hopkin was just 17 years old when she was discovered by Paul McCartney in 1968. She was a Welch folk singer and Paul deemed her voice perfect for a 1920's Russian folk song he was longing to record called "Those Were The Days". Talk about unconventional! McCartney's instincts were right on the money and "Those Were The Days" became a worldwide smash. This is the original Apple recording you would remember from the radio.	1
incredible voice	1
Nice song	1
How can you not like this song?  It's a classic by the person who made it famous.	1
I like this song. Its sounds like Jewish folk music. It is a good one hit wonder. I have not heard anything else she has done.	1
This song was extremely big in the late 80s, early 90s. It's simple, but its synth beats and "yodeling" chorus is instantly recognizable to anyone who was mentally cognizant at the time (it was in a Listerine commercial and an ad for one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, notably). The composition really feels fun and yet heroic at the same time, making you think that it's deeper than it is. It's a shame that Baltimora died before he ever topped it, and even more of a shame that there are no really good covers of this song to carry on the legacy, but that's neither here nor there: If you want something a little cheesy and a lot of fun to dance to, pick up Tarzan Boy!	1
80s classic staple	1
love it	1
I have loved this song since it was used in the old Listerine commercials.	1
It's a good song, either you like it or you don't.	1

Gwyneth paltrow rocks on this song......love the cee lo version but who would have thought gwyneth was such an awesome singer????	1
Gwyneth Paltrow sings this song and does a much better job than Cee-Lo. I was not sure I would like it but it is very good. Gwyneth can really sing.	1
I love the original song, and to hear the glee cast with gwyneth paltrow is a fun alternative... woohoo!  enjoy !	1
Yet another Christian rock special. Same great aesthetic. Wonderfull Voice.	1
I really liked this song, so much that I bought it. I hate reviewing music, who am I Rolling stone magazine? but this reviow your purchases keeps coming up, so to clear it I wrote a review.	1
Not my favorite GLEE song, but I can't help but think of that 'Rain' dance with Gwyneth in that cute outfit every time I listen to it. Reason enough to listen to it often!	1
This has to be one of my favorite Glee mashups ever.  It has such an awsome beat.  They took the best of two songs and made it awesome.	1
Whats not to love about this tune.	1
Good.	1
I needed music for my website during the holidays and this was perfect! I was able to pick out old favorites and had a huge variety for change!	1
Great music at great prices !	1
I thought this would be traditional Christmas songs but they aren't. It is more classical and sung by choirs. Not happy with this selection.	-1
There is some really great music on here mixed in with some pretty terrible music.  I really hate to single out a performer by name, but the singer in a certain orchestra on this album is noticeably off-key and flat in many places.  I'm guessing it's someone's brother-in-law that wanted their music on an album.  Capella Gregoriana seems to be good quality, however I do not like Gregorian chanting so I just skipped those.  I'm not familiar with the The International Childrens' Choir stuff is good as is most of the rest.	1

At least before his arrest, Phil Spector was hailed a musical genius. True, he did produce several classic singles for the Ronettes, Crystals and Righteous Brothers that are some of the most beloved Oldies from the 60s, but he was not on par with someone like Paul McCartney or John Lennon who could craft entire concept albums that remain classics 50-plus years later.  I am not bashing Phil nor his music, just using my above statement to back up my two-star review for this CD that is only worth getting for HES A REBEL, DA DOO RON RON and THEN HE KISSED ME. The other songs on here are nowhere near as good as the three hits. Its too bad that the Crystals didn't have better material, but I feel a little of Phils sound went a long wayit only worked with the right melodies and lyrics, and the rest of whats here is lacking. I fell in love with the Crystals hits back in the early 80s and actually liked them better than the Shirelles or the Chiffons back then. But Ive heard a few of the Shirelles albums recorded in the 60s and even the deep album cuts are much better than the second-string hits found here by The Crystals. The sound quality on this CD isn't the best either. Sorry, cant recommend this.	-1
A VERY POOR MODIFICATION OF THE ORIGINAL...REALLY BAD !	-1
Definately nothing new and truly a regression from my standpoint.  I think your were alot more appealing and had a fresh perspective in your previous offerings. I really can't elaborate much more because nothing on the CD particularly grab me it was just so so Bobby.  But I think you should look for better writers with offer different perspectives on the issues in which you address in your songs which will allow you to project your range and make heads turn when they first when listenin, for instance like Usher on There goes my baby.  Many people didn't think it was him because he hit that note, but long-time Usher fans knew from You got it bad.  So regroup and we look for your next new and improved Bobby V.	-1
Okay	-1
A lot of money and next to impossible to install well.	-1
Like many people, my first encounter with the 'music' of this young man followed a conviction for violence against a woman. Little surprise then, that this album if packed full of explicit references and veiled pornographic imagery - yet aimed squarely at kids and teenagers. The song 'wet the bed' is downright appalling.  A sad indictment of the current state of the music industry that the worlds most famous record label RCA, allowed this to be released.  In June 2010, Chris Brown's application for a visa to enter the UK was refused on the grounds of him "being guilty of a serious criminal offence". This followed criminal convictions that included a violent assault on a female pop star. Brown got lucky and was sentenced to five years of probation, one year of domestic violence counselling, and six months of community service; the judge retained a five-year restraining order on Brown, which requires him to remain 50 yards away from [the victim] Rihanna, 10 yards at public events.  It is with the above publicity that I learn about this 'singer' and I spend several hours sampling the album - trying to find out what the fascination is.  This individual sounds like a third rate karaoke version of a young Michael Jackson. This is 'painting by numbers' music. The tracks sound like they are straight off a studio factory assembly line. Unimaginative and repetitive references to 'make you love me' and 'i'm gonna do x,y,z to you' this is not music I would allow children to come within a mile of.  More mature artists perform this genre with a level of authenticity. This just sounds very young & amateurish.  The track 'Next To You' proves that Brown has some singing ability. How edited the track is, I do not know, but he can clearly sing. It only proves how utterly murky the whole situation is. Underneath the anger, the violence, the bad influences, there is probably a talented young man. Possibly, but I doubt there is enough talent to save this sorry character from a further life of crime.	-1

When it has came down to Jennifer Lopez, she honestly has a lot to really think of for the next few years, aside from the cancellation  of American Idol, and her own personal life in the ruins, with the end of her relationship with her boyfriend Casper, she honestly has a whole lot  to look forward to in her future. Unfortunately, she still has had a whole to deal with, especially with her music taking a tailspin downward. She still needs to find her own voice again. Her latest set of songs for the past several years have honestly not been the best in her voice. Her last album A.K.A. was so poor, it was not even close to even worth buying. That has also been the same with her last album Love?, which took several years, and a few poor starts.  I'm Into You, isn't exactly one of her better songs on the album. The song feels like I've heard it from Jennifer before, and it feels very weak from the heart alone. Her and Lil' Wayne have absolutely poor chemistry along the song. I really didn't find Jennifer gave it her best, honestly her weakest on this album. Hopefully, she needs to make better when her next album comes up.  Song: D+	-1

Like a cheap variation of Hope Sandoval & the Warm Inventions, Still Corners' `Endless Summer' comes of more boring and snooze-worthy than hypnotic and haunting.  The musicality seems stolen from better tracks and the whispered vocals don't emote the way that they should.  The song is trying desperately to encapsulate avant-garde but instead it feels pointless and insipid.  The song title also says a lot for the track itself, which comes across very long despite barely running over three minutes.  The lack of musical depth and the breathy vocals (which at times grate the eardrums) exasperate the track, making it feel as if it were running on and on.  It overstays its welcome rather quickly.  I'm just glad this was free.	-1

This song is really just kind of blah. The vocals seem forced, and it also sounds like the vocalist is really just talking over the guitarist while he/she is trying to play. It isn't very smooth, doesnt really flow, and is kind of just boring. It's not horrible or unlistenable, but i cant imagine going out of my way to listen to this again, and i could easily see myself kind of simply wandering away. Not much here at all.	-1

The player should not put the store first.  Now when I go into my Cloud it says this album is there?  I clicked on it to find out what it is, it wants me to pay for it to be downloaded when I already have! Please Amazon fix this!  I hope nobody else has had this problem.	-1
There is no question that Nicole Scherzinger from The Pussycat Dolls fame has had some ups and down away from being a Pussy Cat. One of them was last year as winner of Dancing With The Stars. But musically, she hasn't really shown that she could sing more than she could chew. Her latest song Don't Hold Your Breath isn't really a song that feels exciting or well-displayed. She doesn't do enough to show that she can fully be seperated from her pussycat dolls days, and be taken more assertively as a solo act in the ways others' like Beyonce' have thrived. Nicole really needs to get something out to make it more of a "wow factor." She said she will have something out soon, but honestly what she has shown is more of a snoozefest that makes it worth holding your breath.  Song: D+	-1
Purchased by an ex-friend who figured out how to hack my account 4+ years ago.	-1
Ok track, but nothing special and no where near Rihanna's best work!	-1
song	-1
It's ok.	-1
Well, it's free. It has that going for it. But I'm not sure I can muster the musical courage to listen to it again.  This doesn't sound like the Crosby and Nash of old. It sounds like a political message masquerading as poetry and dubbed with half-hearted guitar.	-1
ok	-1
Bought for a friend but I didn't care for it. He loved it.	-1
The music is pretty good, but what upset me was the tracks are out of order. It just took me out of it.	-1
Roscoe may have worn himself thin giving everyone else great hooks and not keeping any for himself.  This song is pedestrian at best as far as rapping and production.  The chorus is weak (for Roscoe Dash) so you can skip this one completely.	-1
Man this guy sucks. Two super bowls ruined by him? Please NFL get ur stuff together.	-1
as usual, it disappeared from my library	-1
I didn't order this, no clue how it showed up on my "write a review". So it gets one star.	-1
I give this group its rating because the music didn't do it for me. It seemed as if it was a cloned from the a group from the 70's.	-1
meh	-1
I never bought this !!!!!!!	-1
I just don't like her voice.	-1
Bought for a friend but he didn't care for it.	-1
5-star songs are *typically* the only songs that make it into my library.  Except for this one...I'm not really sure where it came from and I'm not too crazy about it.  With that said, I could tell you that Amazon reviews are a wonderful tool, but make little sense when it comes to music. Music is a personal thing.  It would be much more beneficial to just listen to the sample that Amazon provides and judge it for yourself.  Granted it is only a 30 second sample, but that is generally enough time to explore new bands and get a feel of their music, or make sure that a song you are about to purchase is the right version.  If you want to listen to a sample, simply hover over the track you are interested in, and press the play button.	-1
Error never ordered	-1
That's one way of putting how bad you're music sucks avicii. Levels is the worst and most overrated song of this decade in the 2010's. Good riddance this is absolute trash!	-1
A great freebie from our friends at Amazon.  This is one of the best ways to try out new stuff.	-1
didn't care for this music.	-1
when you raise your kids right - listening to the best of the best music only to find them ordering this when they get a chance.  My sister reminds me that we listened to The Archies and we were raised on Motown and Glen Miller.  Perhaps bad music is just a developmental stage.	-1
It old and got sick of it fast	-1
Solid song at first, but it gets old after about two weeks.  I'm sure she will come out with a new song by then to replace this one.	-1
I didn't order this, no clue how it shows up on my "write a review".	-1
ok	-1
'(Don't Call Me) Mrs. Christmas' is OK if you're looking for a completely non-traditional offering. Modern style is OK but this song is unremarkable.  Therefore I can't recommend this song.	-1
I love Amy Winehouse and love her cover of Will you still love me from the lioness album. But this international version just sucks and I feel cheated by this version. It's not as advertised and I can't understand why it was ever made.	-1
this song could be way betteri know it could.he was rushed i could tell.he should have taken hes time srry i don't like it	-1
I know it says explicit, but other songs have said explicit and have not been explicit at all! So bad had to delete this.	-1
Deleted it from my files.	-1
I was searching for some more christmas music to add to my collection each year I want somethjng to play other than our Chipmunks christmas and Soulful Christmas albums. So this works. Thanks for the free music, free is always good, so no complaints.	-1
Awful	-1
Sadly, I didn't care for this version after purchasing it.	-1
Not as I expected	-1
I stumbled upon "100 Must-Have Bach Masterpieces" while browsing the digital music section at Amazon.com. I was a bit surprised to see that this MP3 album's track listing on its Amazon web page does not show the performing artists' names on well over half the listed tracks, and the few names that are shown I have never heard of before. I thought it best to give this album a "try-before-I-buy" listen before committing even a couple of bucks to its purchase. I am glad I did.  This may be the worst compilation of music by Johann Sebastian Bach I have ever heard. The 100 tracks selected for this album are alright, although they only cover 25 different Bach compositions and therefore don't give a particularly well-rounded picture of the immense depth and breadth of Bach's incredible genius. The biggest problem, however, is the dated musicianship on the album.  Every one of the selections is played too slowly, and every performance is flat, lifeless, and dull. Allegro (quick) movements, especially in the Brandenburg Concerto, Orchestral Suite, piano concerto, and violin concerto selections, are played at a nearly Andante (moderately slow) pace, and Andante movements are played at close to a Largo (very slow) tempo.  Choral pieces fare no better. Choruses and solo vocalists, while technically competent, sing with little of the artistry  found in the best Bach recordings. I found the selections from both the "St. Matthew Passion" and St. John Passion" especially lethargic and monotonous.  There are far better compilations of Bach's music that are performed by world-class musicians who infuse their performances with energy, passion, and tremendous artistry. Two such particularly praiseworthy albums are&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Essential-Bach-2CDs/dp/B000W0B1CO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Essential Bach (2CDs)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/50-x-Bach/dp/B00P3CEUXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">50 x Bach</a>, both of which are highly enjoyable and very affordable.  Bottom line: "100 Must-Have Bach Masterpieces" is a non-starter at any price. Not recommended.	-1
When it has came down to the past 25 years, Madonna has simply been the most influential dance diva of all-time. Her success has been absolutely out of the ordinary. But, unfortunately her music hasn't really hit the home run in her recent records, and with more of her life the past few years on her marriage to Guy Richie ending, and her adopting African babies, she hasn't been able to really deliver to the big hits. That simple is also the case with Celebration, the new single from Madonna's upcoming anthology from her success with the Warner Brothers era. The song sadly doesn't really deliver the same spark Madonna had delivered throughout her past 26 years. The song sadly is not Madonna at her best. It feels like she doesn't hit that nail on the head, as we've heard from her last few records. While she has been known as the material girl, her material needs to be more fine-tuned when she does deliver her next studio album.  Song: D+	-1
The quality isn't very good even though it is labeled Remastered.	-1
Sigh, why did I buy this album? Yeah, like a sucker I brought this album thinking Jon still had his sparks from his past albums, but now realize I support a blatant thief of Black music. I listen through this album to not feel nothing syncing with melodies, the lyrics, and his vocals have charged. Well, I decided to deleted and no longer support this carbon copy knock off ever again!	-1
ex husband hacked into account and ordered them. No idea how it is working.	-1

Nothing...wasn't impressed. I usually listen on Youtube before purchasing unknown songs but this one I didn't...	-1
Another victim of the loudness war.  Compression & distortion ruin what would otherwise be a fine CD.  Here's a suggestion: Deaf recording engineers are really baaaaad for the end product.  If I wanted to listen to compressed & distorted, --I could always turn on the radio. OverCompression puts a turd in the proverbial punchbowl of fine art.	-1
Never like her first single and never like this song at all ! Quit hogging all the airplay and let the other artists shine for once. Please stop making music. Purchase my albums instead , you'll thank me later.	-1
heard this song a few times on the radio days before the super bowl and it just sounds very tacky. To have Nicki Minaj on this track is just plain awful. Hears some advice would you please retire ?	-1

When it has came down to Madonna, musically she has had a lot of challenges to show her voice to a whole new generation. Musically, all the hype she had brought out, turned out to be a absolute failure with her album MDNA. Her lead single from her latest work, and her first after leaving Warner Brother Give Me All Your Lovin' isn't exactly a driven song. It feels like and sounds like Madonna doesn't actually have anything to prove within her voice and sound, especially when trying to reinvent herself for a whole new generation of fans. I think she could've brought more into the song, and doesn't feel like convincing from her voice alone. Hopefully, there is better songs from her to give all your loving to.  Song: D+	-1
Couldn't find the real version on Amazon of this so settled for this remake.  Mislead me that is says Remix and Rihanna feat. Chris Brown and they aren't even on it.	-1
No one of pitbull's best.	-1
No review	-1

For what it is its good but it's just not my style.	-1
its free	-1
the music sucks only got it because it was free	-1
not what I expected, just not my style	-1
Ty	-1
Not interesting.	-1
It"s just OK.	-1
This simply was a little more bass than I prefer. While I am not angst to this style of music, I did not actually appreciate Nehemiah's approach and conviction at communicating the messages.	-1
Not worth the title, as it makes me instinctively think of the single of the same name by Nas, and it's not nearly as lyrically wondrous.	-1
Don't like it	-1
I gave a rating of 2 stars because the live version from the show, sounded awesome to me, but the studio recording really didn't to me.	-1
never again	-1
Nice song	-1
also starts getting eh...	-1
It's a lot longer than the other versions.	-1
Not as great as I had hoped. Only a few cuts are really good.	-1
I really, truly wanted to like this. I like the intro and about the first 15 sec but then for whatever reason I lose interest and think, "what am I listening to?"	-1
Very Disappointing.	-1
ok	-1
i usually like Rita Ora , But this song , JUST IS NOT A GOOD ONE !! i wish i didn't waiste my money on this song .	-1
Only a so-so mix.	-1
too expensive	-1

I don't even know why I purchased this song. I guess for the laughs at how bad it is?	-1
Please sit down ok! It's noise not music!	-1
I like her stlye but I expected more from this song. It's missing some flavor. The hook is nice but I'm not feeling the rest of the song.	-1
ok	-1
You can add this track to the list of songs that sits around on my harddrive and never gets listened to. Wait, maybe I actually deleted it...	-1
I'm disappointed. I love this cd but when I played it was super scratchy and I couldn't enjoy the songs.	-1
I loved A Fine Frenzy's first two albums so much that I bought this one despite what I had heard about it.  It is rather lackluster almost the entire way through.  A good album to lull me off to sleep.  Sorry.	-1
This song doesn't do much for me.  It was requested by a client.	-1
Just like "Can't Hold Us," but a really dumb topic.	-1
After 3-4 years of growing up, this music has an OK beat to it, but just thinking about it, it's very boring and overplayed.	-1
horrible album.  i am a dead prez longtime fan.  they can do so much better.  i was disappointed; i had high hopes for what the band would become.	-1
not one of my favorites.	-1
It old and got sick of it fast	-1
Not my style	-1

Nice song	-1

This is a beautiful song, however, the name of God, nor the Lord Jesus is not mentioned one time. I consider this a beautiful song but not a gospel song. But that's just me. It seems like something appropriate to AA 12-Step program which acknowledges  a "higher power."	-1
The album cover is AWKWARD! I will not take you home too.	-1
No one of pitbull's best.	-1
ok	-1
If this is all MK can pull from his soul in the last several years then MK has smoked himself silly. Save your money and get the Czarface album with Inspectah Deck and ESO.	-1
PRODUCTION: 4/8 LYRICS: 4/8 CONTENT: 4/8 ENJOYMENT: 3/8  Selling My Soul starts off decently and then drastically goes downhill after the Part 2, and it does not really recover after that. It has a laid back atmosphere that decently complements Masta Killa's delivery but the majority of the end is either talking or skits. The production is rather all over the place as some have that Wu-Tang trademark sound while others go on a West Coast synthesized appeal. Masta Killa performs decently with his slow delivery, deep lyrics, and somewhat average flow but the lack of solid hooks, too many skit-time, and change in production kills it. Add his weak attempt to sound like ODB (he is paying homage) and you get annoyed. This is more of a backpack album, beware.	-1
Sorry there's just nothing to grab you in this track. Nothing stands out in the music, lyrics, or the vocals. This one won't make it onto any of my playlists.	-1
this song, at least to me stinks.  Had to delete from my cloud list.  People, please look at what I review as good, and you will see I like R&B, deft jamz, and harder rock.  This one for me at least, stinks.	-1
I didn't order this	-1
ok	-1
Wasn't the artist singing the song.	-1
Ok	-1
I could not get into the music on this album for the life of me. I listen to a huge variety of music and usually find something of value on each album. This sounded like people trying to sound like amazing musicians but they missed the mark. This album is a compilation of those failures.	-1
I never recrived this song snd I was charged for it anyway	-1
After a few attempts, I have yet to finish listening to this song. I forced myself to listen to 1/2 of it, but I don't find it relaxing, inspiring, energizing or engaging.	-1
Not really a good song	-1
not what I expected, just not my style	-1
didn't care for this music.	-1
I should have listened to this version before downloading it.	-1
This was not a version that I expected. Maybe I should have listened to a sample before purchasing. I had hoped to download it onto my kids MP3 players, but this wouldn't do for that at all.	-1
I did not really care for this cover of Santa Baby, but that's my opinion.  I would not have downloaded if I had to pay for it.	-1
I didn't order this	-1
Not great version	-1

Belongs in the early 90's, they missed the mark with this.  I am more of a fan of R&B, so consider that in following my recommendations.	-1
well i vibed to this music for a while, but i found the lyrics decent, and kind of gross, oh well	-1
This is a stressful world  and the amount of work one has to complete each day is enormous. It is such a pleasure when  I come home, to switch on the computer and lean back listening to "Love Song Classics." Within a few minutes, I have forgotten the problems and  floating in the melodious sounds of these classic pieces. Of cause listening to classical pieces is my passion, is my delight and is my mental medicine, I do  wish others could crave for this gift. If it is not your gift, then seek for it; crave for it; desire for it--I assure you that it will  be yours eventually.	-1
Love the song "Demigodz Is Back" so it made me want to pick up the album on sale for 4 dollars. Sadly, There was not a single song other than that one that I liked on this album. It was just a generic rap album that failed to have any stand out tracks on it.	-1
just ok, gets old	-1
I was disappointed.  My Sweetheart is from Michigan and a huge Kid Rock fan.  The version of "Cowboy" I bought said "explicit" but had "radio edit" right in the middle of it.  I put it on her Playlist, but both of us went "WHAT?" as the song played. Don't buy this for a devout Kid Rock fan.	-1
The song is catchy, they all have great voices, but they repeat the chorus too much. It feels like a 10 minute song because they just drag on the same stuff.	-1
My title says it all. Do not waste your time. Spend your money on another song. That is all I have to say.	-1
...if you're gonna like it.  A blind sample of this, and I didn't like it.  It's not my type of music.	-1
I am not sure what the artist was doing here but wow. a little too odd for me. I am not sure what to say except that I did not like it.	-1
song is OK, not really my style i guess.  I didn't enjoy it but if this type of music is your thing, than go ahead.	-1
didnt care for this app at all...thought it would be entertaining and exciting but wasn't impressed with it at all....	-1
did not like it after i got it , i did like the 20 second pre view of it , to bad amazon don't do refunds on mp3's !	-1
LIKED BLURRED LINES BETTER. Like him J.T.---lots of talent---funny guy--seen him on J.FALLON SHOW many times--loved it! Not a fan of JAY Z------MR. TALK A SONG.>>>HOW HE MADE MILLIONS IS BEYOND ME----PLUS HE'S AGLY---GETTO-ISH W/MILLIONS.  Him and his slutty wife---why does all these females have to sell a song with theIR privates hangin' out. Doin' the twerk--shakin' the booty thing---REALLY NOW!____????? REALLY And she> can sing--don't need to teach her kid how to act like she does---SLUTTY--BAD!	-1
I bought this thinking it was an 80's song.. it wasn't. It's ok.	-1
Like a dead Mackerel in the moonlight, it  stunk to Heaven's highest mountain, & it swam like a 1 ton rock.	-1
"Cruz Del Sur" by rvsb is a fairly generic electronica track with the required spacey club beats.  The song is not really worth listening to more than once, but I could see its appeal if you want to hit the dance floor.	-1
Just keep running.	-1
Good concept behind the song, but grated on my nerves.  The hook was awkward; the lyrics seemed to be a mouth full and forced; singing parts weren't quite up to par.  Some people can sing.  Some people can rap.  Very few can do both and do it well.	-1
I didn't order this	-1
this song, at least to me stinks.  Had to delete from my cloud list.  People, please look at what I review as good, and you will see I like R&B, deft jamz, and harder rock.  This one for me at least, stinks.	-1

Crap Crap crappy and Crappies.  I cannot find any redeeming value in this album.  I love to be entertained but this was just crapola.	-1
Ok	-1
Sucks	-1
FUTURE WEARING A SKIRT AND NICKI TELLING YOU SHES WORTH A MILLION DOLLARS GO FIGURE.	-1
Do not confuse this album with those by Artist:  Christian Gospel Choir....as did I.  Unless you like gospel music instrumentals done in the old "Big Band" style that calls for an image of a Vegas show........stay far...far away from this one!!! The few vocals are not worth the disquieting of the Spirit.	-1
song	-1
1 is not for song itself but for the clean version which still contains the "B" word defeating my whole purpose for buying this version.	-1
Not still into this.	-1
It ain't fun.	-1
I heard it on Pandora and thought that I'd like it if I heard it more.....wrong....sounds like most of her up tempo songs with very little in the way of depth or verve...	-1
Not worth the price: this digital download was free!	-1
I was not inpressed, it was hard to listen to and a major downer, there way a darkness to it that deeply disturbed me. No positive side to it. And the swearing added nothing to it. A waste of my time.	-1
This track wasn't worth the price paid: It was free!	-1

Just okay.  Live recording.  Not the best sound quality.	-1
Not good	-1
This is of value to me, since it was Remixed to extend, but whoever mixed it distorted in spots, maybe from bass guitar or bass drum, you hear "popping" throughout. Sad.	-1
Michael Buble has made a fortune covering great old standard songs that were originally made famous by Frank Sinatra and others.	-1
There is a tonal quality that is just not appealing t o me.  This is another that I will just delete.	-1
Bought it after seeing Gatsby and after listening to the song 3 times, it now is the most annoying song I have ever heard.	-1
It was ok	-1
Downloaded this as it was billed as free; did not disclose it was a time-limited file that wouldn't work after awhile.  I thought the music was great, at least what I heard of it before the file quit working.  This rating is not indicative of the group (I'll go buy an actual MP3 album later), just the fact that the limitations were not properly disclosed.	-1
Not sure what LeAnn was shooting for here, but if she's trying to reinvent herself it's not good.  Her earlier work was far better and she's capable of much more than this.	-1
The E.P was kinda boring. The songs sounded like a Buckingham E.P, his notes weren't good and a couple of sangs all you heard in them were the chorus being repeated over 10 times. After almost a decade, this is the best songs they can put out? I'd pass on this E.P, not worth the time.	-1
I didn't like this song sorry	-1
I didn't order this	-1
I DIDN'T LIKE IT COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE MUSIC,WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE FROM MY DEVICE. But most  people WOULD find interesting.	-1
Not worth the price: this digital download was free!	-1
Only got this for a friend.	-1
Love Brit Brit. Not a fan of this song.	-1
the cost is too high the return on investment too low and vastly over rated in my mind. Nothing more to say.	-1

What I hate is that when you receive an email from amazon and you look at the songs they are already "checked" for purchase.  It is easy to accidentally buy the song that you do not want.  That is what happened to me.  By the way I listened to the song and hate it anyway.	-1
the music sucks only got it because it was free	-1
Not all that I thought out would be except that Amazon offered it for free that day.  Some of the songs are okay; but most of them suck.	-1
didn't like	-1
One good song the rest were ... not.	-1
the music sucks only got it because it was free	-1
It doesn't play all the songs.  I only get 1 song.  It's the worst music recording that I've bought.  If I could I would send it back.	-1
did not like	-1
Decided to try it after hearing the short piece off Amazon. Some Soul I like but this is not one of them. Not quite sure why, just had no appeal to me.	-1
I don't care for the one second wavering that predominates this music.  Price was right for using up some digital credits and I'm glad I tried it, but probably will not play it again.  I like the Winter Solitutde much better.	-1
Disappointed	-1
The cover, to me, does not match the music.	-1
He must have been in a lyric slump when he wrote this, it needs more music, a better singer, and a point.	-1
I got this when Amazon offered it as a free song other wise I would not have given it a second thought. I usually take advantage of the free music Amazon offers and sometimes I like the song and sometimes I don't. In this case if it had not been free I would not have gotten it.	-1
Didn't like it	-1
It was worth the $0 price, so if you like piano, it's a good investment. Particularly if you like Christmas... this is for you.	-1
ok music	-1
Not my cup of tea. It was a gift.	-1
Tried something a little different than what I usually listen to; glad I did not pay for this song.  Not my favorite.	-1
A lot of the same words and the music goes in circles, they could have done more with it to make it a lot better, I am not sure what, but having less noise in the background would be nice.	-1
Really wanted to like this album, but it was just weak. Trying to think of a standout track, nothing comes close. Kind of sad to see where he is going.	-1
Tried something a little different than what I usually listen to; glad I did not pay for this song.  Not my favorite.	-1
Sounds like the background music for a horror film or a James bond film. I found it wanting on many levels. Too bad, they could have so much more with it.	-1
Better than some other Lumineers stuff, but still sucks.	-1
I like the Lumineers, but I am not a big fan of this song. The vocals do not mesh well together, and although some might say that it is charming, I find it discombobulating. Still, I can listen to it if it were playing on the radio without turning it off.	-1
Okay	-1
I expected this music to keep me interested. It did not do that for me. I kept listening in the hopes that it would put me in a wonderful and happy mood, but it did not.	-1
this is not something I would ever have again on my computer or on my MP3,MP4 player.  Instead  of sounding like a glorious day in paradise, it sounded more like a Yak breeding in a rice field.	-1
Given the fact that he was the lead singer of one of the biggest R&B boy bands of the 21st century, one would think that Omarion would have a better carrer. However after a good first album, he followed it up with the equally bad 21 which did nothing to show off his vocal talent. With Olluison, Omarion is singing songs that truly show he was and always will be nothing more than a studio singer.	-1
Crap Crap crappy and Crappies.  I cannot find any redeeming value in this album.  I love to be entertained but this was just crapola.	-1
Downloaded this song by accident its cute but I don't love it	-1
Blah	-1
Do not listen to this song. It is such a terrible excuse for rock and roll. The beginning of this song makes me want to beat people up. The guitars suck, the drums suck, the lyrics are extremely trite, and they use the overrated phrase 'where I wanna be' in this song. If I ever hear this song again, I will start a club that prevents songs like this from being liked.	-1
Trifling lyrics. Wish I would've youtubed it first so I would've known it was junk rap.	-1
Was free so thought Id try and see if I liked this artist music/songs. Once on my iTune website pop up said to hear ~ free trail 3 months down load but no rules explaining if automatically charged after trail over on my Amazon account. Since I had 18 free unknown to me different artist I decided to never listen and will delete them. It you know this artist and like i would suggest you try the free trail.	-1
It was free	-1
Crap Crap crappy and Crappies.  I cannot find any redeeming value in this album.  I love to be entertained but this was just crapola.	-1

The lack of talent is what really hurts this song...even in the studio version her voice cracks when trying to hit simple notes...she tries to hit high and low pitches in this song and they fail miserably...this "singer" has no idea how to execute the core fundamentals of her "job." If she doesn't have a dance beat to distract from her lack of talent all of her flaws are on full display. This is simply one of the worst songs I have ever heard ...aside from another Katy Perry song. I can't think of anything worse.   Absolutely terrible.	-1

When it has came down to Lady Gaga and the songs that she has delivered for her Artpop record, they actually have not been as strong and striking as they were when she first did The Fame and Born This Way. In fact the songs Applause and Do What U Want with R. Kelly were not even striking the surface of the voice that had made her a female icon. She definitely needs to find better for her fans, and for her own self in voice. Her latest single, G.U.Y., the third single from Artpop really doesn't ignite or light up a fire the way her other songs had done before in her little monsters' hearts. I really didn't find the song to catch a fire the way people felt with Katy Perry's Roar and the songs that Beyonce' had shown like Drunk In Love. Those songs are also terrible, but those hard core fans wanted it badly, here you don't want this song. Lady Gaga doesn't even now the G.U.Y.  Song: D	-1
When it has came down to the hoopla around what Lady Gaga had came out with her Artpop album, it has been more trash and lukewarm than striking the heart of the music she has had within from her past works Born This Way, and her first album. Sadly, the quote of the name of the fame has drifted in the wind like her voice. Her music just hasn't worked for her like Applause and Do What U Want with R. Kelly. She just doesn't have that strike in the voice anymore in her songs. Her latest song G.U.Y., the third single from Artpop is trying to be more of a Madonna and Michael Jackson-esque sound, but sadly it doesn't have the interest at heart. Instead the song feels wasted and not worth the time. Maybe Lady Gaga should find herself a better G.U.Y. to be with her music than throw her voice away with.  Song: D	-1

It is honestly and absolutely so sad whenever someone whom is young and talented has thrown their voice away by making poor decisions in their music, they are just not worth it. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles is one of those singers that has really been more of a product, than a actual songstress of the heart. It is just so sad, because the more stunts she has pulled, or the more she is severely overplayed like Michael Jackson was, the more her songs are not worth listening to anymore. It is sad. Flawless has been one of those songs to where she is trying ti be more street than really rap alone, and tragically she has not been able to deliver around the voice alone. I personally found this song to be just as wasted as when she tried to deliver on rap with songs like Video Phone and Diva from her I Am... Sasha Fierce. Overall, if you are a die hard fan or new to Beyonce' Knowles music, I would suggest you pass this song up, and go to her songs when she was a part of Destiny's Child, or play Crazy In Love to death.  Song: D-	-1
It is honestly and absolutely so sad that whenever someone young and talented has wasted their talent away, by making songs that have honestly bee more mediocre, that sincere from the heart. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles has been one of those singers that has been more like a manufactured product than a real songstress. It is sad that when she came out with her surprise record, she honestly could not even come close to holding a a note from the heart in her work. It is sad that she hasn't found the right songs either, whether it was Drunk In Love with Jay-Z, Pretty Hurts, or her single Flawless with Chimamanda. The song is definitely a waste of her heart, and sounds seemly too familiar like her earlier songs like Diva. Overall, I definitely found this song to lag the talent she had from her earlier work, and her days with Destiny's Child. Overall, if she keeps making songs that are terrible like this, than I think she should honestly retire from music period. Beyonce' Knowles is not flawless, just flawed.  Song: D+	-1
There is honestly a difference between a singer who shows a real, human and uncanny voice, and someone who markets themselves to be more like a manufactured product than a real person. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles is a product, not a real singer. Sadly, the feeling of her music has taken a turn downward with each and every record. When she had made a surprise release for her Beyonce' album, the move might have set sales on fire, but the album itself was a waste of money and time. Flawless, one of her songs from the Beyonce' album is honestly terrible. She doesn't actually ignite in her voice and it sounds more like a robot than a real songstress. I really did not find the song to actually deliver, instead I honestly feel that she brought in her hip hop style, and took it for a tailspin down. It really is one of her more pathetic songs on the album. Perhaps, the next time she comes out with music, than just be a product, she can honestly really feel what a real flawless singer is like. Too bad, there aren't many good ones anymore.  Song: D	-1
It is so sad whenever someone whom is suppose to be talented, has to be more of a product to deliver better in music. But sadly, the problem with Beyonce' Knowles is that she has been more of a product, trying to severely overexpose her music, and not give better in her own work overall, by putting patience and time to find better. When I had heard she was going to pull out a "surprise record" back in 2013, I was honestly not interested in stunts without listening to the voice at heart. Sadly, she really did not push herself better into her own work for her self-titled Beyonce' record in 2013, she just instead overdid herself and fell apart at the seems. most of the tracks have really been poorly prepared, and shown no growth in her soul. XO is honestly one of those songs that doesn't flow as a ballad. I really found it to be weaker than her past works like Flaws In All and Listen from Dreamgirls back in 2006. I really found this song to be a bust at soul overall. Perhaps it should be time for Beyonce' Knowles to think about retirement, and come back when she better up her chops than faltering at the soul as a stunt.  Song: D+  5,400th Review!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, she has honestly been more of a product than a real singer, and unfortunately she overexposed her sound and her voice has been shattered. Overall, when it came down to the hype around her surprise album in 2013, she really made a lot more songs that have been cheap at her heart, and showed that she didn't have any growth from the soul. She has really made a lot of songs that really weren't as strong as what she had done earlier. Everyone was so overdone with Drunk In Love, that most of the other songs found from her self-titled album didn't get enough recognition or airplay. XO was one of those songs that really was more of a lackluster ballad that didn't show a strike that was stronger. In fact, the song was definitely weak overall. I really didn't like the song, and I felt that her prior ballads like Halo and her rendition of the great Etta James ballad At Last were much better. I suggest you find another Beyonce' Knowles track to own.  Song: D+	-1
It is honestly so sad whenever someone young and talented throws their voice away, and they've worn out their sex appeal and voice aside. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles has been one of those singers that has been more of a product than a real songstress. It is honestly very sad because she has made songs that have not really delivered, they have just been so overplayed like the manufactured voice at hand, not the songstress on the inside, unlike other divas that were worth something like Whitney Houston and Natalie Cole. When it came down to Ms. Knowles surprise album that she came out with in 2013, it actually has been more like a joke than a "wow" factor. Most of the songs have been more like jokes at hand, like Partition. She didn't feel like she igniting in the sex appeal, instead she felt more like a whimper overall. I really didn't like the song, and she really hasn't grown to be more of the diva at the absolute soul. Overall, if you are new to Beyonce's music, I would recommend passing his song up, and go to Crazy In Love, when she used to have a voice.  Song: D	-1
When it has honestly came down to Beyonce' Knowles, she has been more of a product in voice, than really has flexed her work outside from her heart. Honestly when it has came to all the music from her surprise 5th album, she really had wasted a lot of peoples' time on the ears, and absolutely from the heart. I really found the music to be very tiresome, and unfortunately lagged a lot from her own heart. I found a lot of the collaborations from Drunk In Love, and Blow to be wasted. Superpower is another song that feels a bit more shady in her voice. She & Frank Ocean have absolutely no chemistry and just lags from her own drive. I really found the song to be one of her weakest songs from the album, and definitely not worth listening to. Frank has a little better work alone, but it definitely is not worth downloading the song alone. I think people have been so caught up in Drunk In Love, that this one was "superpowered" to a loss.

Fits the film nicely, but isolated it's just a lot of frantic percussion, strings and synth pounding noises.

It's all about going into space for Kid Cudi on Satellite Flight, or so it would seem. Actually it is more likely a metaphor for taking us listeners into new, unexplored dimensions of thought, not new territory for the expansionist thinker Kid Cudi. The album is enveloped in Cudi's deep, uninterrupted singing voice with one rapping verse inserted in the thick of the album. It is quite the experimental pop/rnb affair, hardly a hip hop album to be correct. Cudi is in typical form lamenting, crowing, and going on in that jazzy, stylistic way of his about his mental separation from society. When he is not singing and besides the one rapping verse on the album, large swaths of intergalactic instrumentals mellow out the proceedings. Satellite Flight: The Journey To Mother Moon definitely has Kid Cudi's patented musical vibe even if it cannot be classified or critiqued as a rap album. Within the genre that Cudi has invented for himself, whatever the name, the album is a respectable one.	-1

I thought I had a good idea--listen to the great melodies of opera without struggling with foreign languages.  It didn't work out so well.  I counted only 7 good tracks (4, 5, 7, 13, 20, 41 and 49) out of 100.  The rest was intolerable, boring bluster and claptrap.	-1

There is no question that when it has came down to female singers, they have had a lackluster drive in having really good songs. Jazmine Sullivan has been one of those singers who has honestly been unappreciated and overlooked with having great songs and honestly her music has shown some highs that brought out the best in her voice. But honestly, she also has had some songs that just really have been a miss in her work from the heart. Her lead single from her album Reality Show, Dumb, isn't actually one of her better songs.  I really think the song isn't actually one of her good songs, but the video of puppets and humans having affairs and make-outs is honestly one of the creepiest videos I had ever seen. I really hope Jazmine Sullivan has good music with Reality Show coming out, but this song is honestly a must have for your music library.  Song: D	-1

It seems like the record companies who track what gets released to radio have the stupidest brains when it comes to choosing singles.  I know Brantley Gilbert penned this song because of the tragic death of a soldier, and that makes a song worth serious attention, but there are tons of other country songs out there regarding fallen soldiers or soldiers in general out there and much more emotional and heart-felt than this song. I don't mind Brantley Gilbert making a song about the undeserved death of a soldier, since most of his material released as singles is either mediocre or absolutely horrible (I give 'Bottoms Up' credit for at least being catchy even though there are things about it that I don't like), but trying to express the emotion of th death of a loved one in a song, and then using the most trite, horrid, and annoying high-pitched guitar solos all over the song make the person the song is about ashamed. In fact, this is worse than what Gilbert has put out with any of his other singles. At least songs like 'Read Me My Rights' & 'Stone Cold Sober' show that Gilbert is making music correctly even though the instrumental elements of the songs may not be done well.  But, when Radio Stations fumble with what gets played on the radio, and then choose a very annoying and terrible song to play, thats what should be abolished for eternity.  Even worse is when they play a bad song ad nauseum, you predict they probably won't play a song that much to elavate your anger, but they do anyway, no matter how you feel about the song, and it never stops until you start hating the song with a passion, and THEN they start to cool down with that song. Instead of just stopping with the song right when you feel like they need to stop. That is a method in radio, not just country, that needs to be abolished from reality for eternity.  We need a Brantley Gilbert song that isn't so boring, bland, trite, or not what you want to repeat on Spotify. His new single isn't helping because besides the country pop and rock stuff that you saw in 'Bottoms Up', Gilbert ends up using some of the worst cliches and overused phrases. Instead of thinking to yourself 'Finally, a song from this guy I can actually tolerate beyond chart movement', its always the same feelings about a whole new song all over again.  So overall, listen to Toby Keiths 'Ameican Soldier' instead of this stupid Def Leppard, Guns N Roses country garbage with lyrics.	-1

It is honestly absolutely so sad whenever someone young and talented has lost themselves in pure voice and heart. Mariah Carey had so much talent in the 90's and in the 2000 decade when she released The Emancipation of Mimi, but these days the talent has been more wasted in heart. The music on her most recent album Me I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse has been more of a waste of time, and far departure considering the end of her own marriage to Nick Cannon, and the lack of drive in her recent works. Thirsty, the lead single from the album is absolutely one of her worst songs she has recorded in years. It is definitely a lack of time that she couldn't electrify in her own soul, and lags what she showed in songs like We Belong Together and It's Like That. She honestly lagged a real rhythm from her own heart and the upbeat songs she used to deliver, makes me want to go to her earlier works, when her voice was strong and when she used to have talent. I would definitely pass this song up.  Song: D-	-1
When it has came down to Mariah Carey, her music at heart has been terrible and out of tune for quite awhile. It has been a very long while since she came out with new songs. The past few years set the motion of her music failing and more about her feuds between Nicki Minaj, and the decision of firing her as a judge on American Idol. Her latest set of songs, do fail to ignite on her new record Me... I Am Mariah: The Elusive Chanteuse. Thirsty, the next single from wasted album shows that Mariah still is missing the mark at heart and in voice as well. I really found the song to be even worse than even all the songs she had released from her last album, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel. She definitely needs to find better in her voice, and her heart. Hopefully, there will be better from her to quench your thirst in her voice.  Song: D+	-1

Sounds like Brian Tyler was sampling some of Jerry Goldsmith's score to 'The Mummy' with some of this music - in fact, I found this distracting enough while watching the film that I had to pause it to think of where I had heard that theme before. Check out the Mummy music and see if you hear it too. I also hear shades of the Marvel comics-page flipping theme. This score was otherwise flat and forgettable. Sure, it matched the bombastic explosions and CGI sensory overload of the film but doesn't work isolated.	-1
Devan DuBois' "Long Live" is a pseudo blues rocker that puts its Jack White & Black Keys influences front and center.  Mr. DuBois' voice is a dead ringer for Mr. White's, but without the pitch and emotion.  If you want to hear warmed over White Stripes or Black Keys music, then this song will do the trick.	-1

With the minor feud between Meek Mill and Wale rumored to be cooled down and new albums slated to be released in the near future from each of Rick Ross and the two aforementioned rappers, things are currently looking up or Maybach Music Group (MMG). To brighten up these rosy realities for Double-M.G., label mate Stalley (Kyle Myricks) has just released his debut solo LP, Ohio, which is of course named after his home state. True to his roots, musical influences and the MMG code, Stalley has filled Ohio with enough hustlin', stuntin' and Midwestern hoo- ridin' so that fans can easily recognize his brand and affiliations. His fluid flow is sufficiently varied in style and vocabulary, and the different inflections of his tone of voice give his rapping an animated, non-mechanized feel. Stalley discusses his hard times coming up in life but also mellows out by indulging in the club scene, lady loves, fashion and cars, particularly the sporty, high-performance type. Speaking of cars, Stalley has created an intriguing interpolation/remake of Eazy-E's "Boyz-N-The- Hood" single, called "Jackin' Chevys," about getting it on in hot, stolen cars. Ohio is a relatively singular affair for Stalley except for guest appearances by Nipsey Hussle, Rick Ross, August Alsina, Ty Dolla Sign and Rashad, who produced much of the album's music. As a pleasant surprise, Stalley has also brought legends De La Soul out of retirement to spit a few bits of wisdom for listeners on "Navajo Rugs." The productions contain some real instruments and original beat loops but several sound like recreations of trap/drill standards, not necessarily a bad thing considering the album as a whole has a very unique, distinct sound beneath the lyrics. The most important fact to note about Ohio is that Stalley has not fully fallen prey to commercial, music market appetites. Instead, he has mixed up his content and style with new concepts and fresh rhymes and music, making for a solid enough solo debut.	-1

Far removed is Houston rapper Paul Wall from his glory days of record label-promoting and genre-defining collaborations with fellow Houston rapper Chamillionaire, who teamed up with Wall in the late 1990s to form The Color Changin' Click before disbanding around 2005. A viable Southern hustling emcee of yesteryear, Paul Wall has made contributions to hip-hop through his records with the Swishahouse label and most recently with Paul Wall Music. Wall's seventh LP, The Po-Up Poet, is more material of Wall's archetypal style, filled with notions of weed, money, cars, ladies, jewelry and lots of "drank." Never one to blow minds with advanced lyricism, Paul Wall has historically received regards for his raps of steady rhyming, and this same modus operandi is applied faithfully by Wall in Po-Up. He is still that same on-the-grind hustler with expensive tastes, focused on staying on his toes and having fun in between time. Worthy of notable mention are the tracks "No Favors," a lesson in self-reliance, and "Codeine Heartbreak," where Wall discusses his love/hate relationship with extra strength, prescription cough syrup. The guest line-up is predictable, offering up verses of Dirty South flavor, especially from Screwed Up Click rapper Z-Ro, who appears twice on the album. The electronic trap beats match all of Wall's objectives and while formulaic, they are just original enough to be tolerable. At this point in Wall's career, The Po-Up Poet is a subpar effort, only attractive to die hard Paul Wall obsessives.	-1
It honestly is absolutely sad that whenever someone young and has all the talent in the world, can sincerely throw their career away. Unfortunately, Beyonce' Knowles is one of those singers, who has became more like a manufactured product, and not even a real human songstress anymore. When it had came to pulling out a surprise record for the music industry and for her own fans, she honestly made a poor choice of songs for herself, and lost the ability to reach into a human soul. Her collaboration with Nicki MInaj on the remix of her wasted song Flawless, was definitely a poor choice of song to collaborate. Nicki doesn't actually make a bad song good, she makes a poor song, want to wish you plugged your ears and never heard Beyonce' or Nicki ever again. There is absolutely no chemistry together in the song, and as for Beyonce', she really wasted her own talent away by trying to be more street and rough, and lagging the talent from her own voice to follow in suite. If you are a fan of Beyonce', or even a fan of Nicki, I would recommend passing this song up, because it is purely flawed.  Song: F	-1

Go get Autumn effect, simple as that. I seriously don't even know what I am listening to with this turd.	-1
I was disappointed.  My Sweetheart is from Michigan and a huge Kid Rock fan.  The version of "Cowboy" I bought said "explicit" but had "radio edit" right in the middle of it.  I put it on her Playlist, but both of us went "WHAT?" as the song played. Don't buy this for a devout Kid Rock fan.	-1
I just needed it for a gig!	-1
Gareth is a very nice man, but this soundtrack was, unfortunately, a great disappointment to me.  The main theme recurrent throughout most of the tracks was very similar to the main theme that Masashi Hamauzu used for his Final Fantasy XIII soundtrack.  Although somewhat beautiful, the Ori theme so heavily recalled Hamauzu's earlier work that I was unable to enjoy it.  The tracks seemed like remixes of FF13's "The Promise" and "Serah's Theme," and it was impossible to dissociate one from the other.  If Gareth did this by accident, having never been aware of Hamauzu's work, what a dreadful happenstance!  I hope such a mistake never happens to him again--no doubt many composers worry that they might inadvertently seem to be plagiarizing, when they really were not doing so.	-1

Simply awful.  No attention at all was paid to balance or ambience in these recordings.  Glad it was only 99 cents!	-1
War Report rappers from Queens, NY, Capone-N-Noreaga, or CNN, a period model of East Coast gangsta rap from the 90s and later, have returned to the game this year with Lessons, their fifth studio album and a familiar rollout of their famed street brand. Besides being almost painfully traditional for the duo, Lessons includes all new verse-material and original beats, which are conventional and come from an assortment of credible producers (Ayatollah, Hazardis Soundz, Beatz N Da Hood, etc). Their Queens homie and long time collaborator, Tragedy Khadafi (formerly Intelligent Hoodlum), plays a major and perhaps excessive guest-part and is joined by fellow features Royal Flush, The LOX, Anna Shay and Raekwon. Overall, these are loaded spots but uninteresting in their predictability. Capone and Noreaga do convey some different feelings in addition to hardcore street angst (the madness of ghetto crime in many instances of course, homie-love in "U.M.A.R" and lady-love in "Chinese Girl" for example) but they're in virtually the same format as all their previous releases. With low relevance, so-so rapping and outdated gangsterism and style, Lessons is a dwindling project from the emcees, whose peak is most likely behind them at this point.	-1
Poor Britney...just can't catch a break. She thought that enlisting flavor of the month Igloo Australia would help her return to the top of the charts. Little did she know that the majority of the public was already tired of Azalea's blaxploitation. And not only that, the song blows. Was it written by a kindergartener or something? Seriously Brit, Iggy is not the answer to your chart problems - you have to actually try. I'll take the robotic Work Beezy over this any day.	-1

I did not expect her music to be so weak. I saw her on a Live performance. She kicked butt. No good on record though. Sorry Grace.	-1
Well I'm writing this review to improve Amazon's algorithm on recommended music on my account.  This is going to be brutal. To be clear I'm a Rivethead/Prog Metal Fan.  Which means if it doesn't have a seven string guitar  thrash line supported by an atmospheric synth line. Don't bother.  Ew, seriously like learn how to play a guitar..	-1

The real beginning of the end of Evancho's career. This s was absolute garbage by someone who has a beautiful voice but never wants to develop it.	-1
Sorry, but for me this is a commercial and basically pedestrian effort that sounds similar to other music of the current day, sung like many songs are sung by young singers; a bit of a diminishing of such a great voice, but younger fans will probably love it.  No goosebumps here, and that is a first for me with a Jackie E. recording.	-1
This album is auditory castration  Coheed is typically very badass and amazing and hard hitting, but this album is the total opposite. This is like little baby girl music.  It has no teeth, no punch, no fight in it. Its like the soundtrack they would give your dog to take home after they just neutered him. This is like the perfect album to put on when visiting your 70 year old grandma, so you two can sit and listen together as she knits you a sweater and bakes cookies. And then you can crank the volume when you go out back and prance around in the flower garden.  If you like awesome music that you can respect than this album is not for you. Just go listen to all their other albums, since they are what men listen to.	-1

Sad sad screeching. Got this for a dollar at the Pittsburgh flea market. Paid 99 cents too much.  Pathetic noise. Horrid.	-1
Watched her show in PBS, no real character except for frequent head-shaking.  Not worth buying.	-1
I was blessed with the opportunity to hear this before purchase. I'm not sure if he is just testing us, the fans to see how many will buy anything with his name on it. Sorry but I have to pass.  Is it the worst music ever recorded? No but the fact that it is in the running makes it a sad thing to think about.	-1
It's a catchy song at first, but the more you listen to it, the cheesier their style gets.	-1

Let me get this straight - he cheats on Miranda with Gwen and yet somehow it's all Miranda's fault and country fans are just gobbling it up? The hypocrisy is unbelievable...No wonder country music is in the sad taste it is right now.	-1
It is sad whenever someone young and talented does not even come close to delivering at the soul of the voice, and instead falling by the wasteside. For Ariana Grande, she has been trying to mature into diva-hood like the ranks of divas from Mariah Carey to the great Whitney Houston (as her lackluster drive had shown on the ABC show Greatest Hits.) For Ariana, I was not very impressed with her lackluster songs already released from her Dangerous Woman album from Into You and Dangerous Woman. But also her song from last year, Focus didn't even shine her voice brighter, instead her voice sounded more shrill and putting too much emphasis on looking for herself, than a real voice. Her latest single, Let Me Love You, the third from her Dangerous Woman, isn't actually a striking duet. She and Lil' Wayne do not even have enough chemistry to sparkle on this track to shimmer as one of the more classic duets. Perhaps ariana has more growing up she has to do to make the heart firmly fonder. Maybe when she makes another record, it will work for her, but not now.  Song: D+	-1
Played the original theme song more times than I can count.  The original was about how people in fear have the Ghostbusters to call.  How when in danger they have heroes to turn to.  The original inspired and entertained.  The music energized fans everywhere, and the Ray Parker Jr.'s voice was powerful.  This music sucked, and the verses were distort versions of the original.  It wasn't even a single singer doing it.  They had one singer doing the main bit, and then a separate rap singer for some.  And it didn't even seem like singing at many points - just fanatically chanting "I'm not Afraid"	-1
