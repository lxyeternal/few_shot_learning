Ahh, Diablo.  Once again, Blizzard Software has proven their ability to make a game that absolutely engrosses the user and raises the bar for other developers out there.  Diablo I spawned a slew of clones following the  success of it's action/RPG hybrid, but the only game that could really  dethrone Diablo was, you guessed it... Diablo II. Gameplay first.  Blizzard has expanded the number of available character types to 5, with  more mage-type classes and a fighter/mage Paladin.  As you gain experience  points, you are still able to place your experience points in general  categories that boost your mana, strength, dexterity, etc.  It helps in  placing your experience points to know how you want your character to  develop.  For example, if your Paladin is going to be a fighter, you'll  want to boost his strength and dexterity.  Still, you'll want to boost his  mana as well in order to take advantage of his magical abilities.  For the  Necromancer and the Sorceress, Mana is clearly the way to go.  For the  Barbarian, strength, and for the Amazon, Strength and Dexterity. The  skill tree is also insanely expanded, with unique skills for each class.  There are so many skills, you need to pick a few to specialize in so that  you can rock with them when the time comes! Spread your skill points too  thin, and you'll be kinda good at too many things, and not good enough at  anything. The skills alone make for a replayable game, but there is much,  much more to DII.  The terrain is once again randomized, but much more so  than the original.  I've started four separate games, and the terrain has  been different every time.  The quests are more of a driving force in DII,  causing you to focus on your task while sweeping through the huge levels.  The entire act I is bigger than the first game. There are a plethora of  unique and magical items, none of which I have seen repeated yet.  THere is  also the new concept of "socketed" weapons and armor, which  allows the player to socket magical gems into their weapons and gain  bonuses from fire damage to life-stealing.  THe unique items also change  the way your character looks, which means the player has more of a  connection with their character and keeps them on the lookout for items  which may look cool when placed on the character. The monsters are  excellent, varying widely in size, shape, type and ability.  There are  plenty of unique monsters who drop nifty magical and (sometimes) unique  items. And if all that wasn't enough, the story is artfully woven into  the game, told between acts with beautifully rendered cutscenes and in-act  by NPCs and events as they unfold before you.  In the first act you connect  with some of the people from the first game, though you may notice some  differences! I have been playing this game so much that you'd think I was  sick of it by now.  Guess again: I'm just raring to get back home and play  some more. And finally, if the single player wasn't engrossing enough,  Multiplayer coop mode is excellent and quite enjoyable.  You can party with  as many as seven other people (though it does get crowded! ), and share  experience points as you clean out the levels.  All in all, Diablo II has  enough replayablilty for the next three years of my gaming life. And  finally, the graphics.  Well, many people have slammed the graphics, saying  they haven't changed at all.  Not true, especially if you own a good 3D  card.  While it's true the game runs in 640x480 / 256 colors, if you stop  and think about it, could this game really work at higher resolutions?  Many items are already tough to pick up, let alone see (though the ALT key  makes that MUCH easier in DII), and at 1024x768, the game might be  invisible.  Plus, there are nifty spell effects for us 3D card owners, and  once you get out of the first act, the game stops looking so much like  Diablo I and starts really taking shape. Bottom line:  Buy it.  Play it.  Join me.	1
Unlike most pc gamers, I never played the first Diablo.  With all the hype and how much my friends enjoyed the first game, I figured this would be the game to buy.  Well, it is.  The fun and reaplayability factors definitely  make up for the less than stellar graphics in this game.  The controls and  gameplay are superb.  The sound and music is some of the most realistic  I've ever heard (except for some of the recent FPS games).  I haven't  played on Battle.net yet simply because I'm having too much fun playing my  own game and TCP/IP'ing with my buddies.  Me and my friends started our  game after we were halfway through with Act 1 in our own games, and we were  amazed at how much fun we were having even though it was our second time  through Act 1.  When you play online with others it proposes a whole new  slew of options like trading, etc. (teamwork!).  What makes the game so  replayable is that everytime you play it, it's different.  Even if you play  as the same character, you will end up getting weapons in a different  order.  The weapons and magic are just AWESOME by the way.  It's so cool  how killing the same enemies over and over (and over) again can be SO MUCH  FUN!  Usually I HATE normal RPG games, but this action RPG stuff is my bag  ... baby!	1
As a major fan of the original Diablo, I have to say that I am both thrilled and frustrated by Diablo II.  Thrilled because it is essentially the same game only with more options (more character classes, more skills,  larger levels, etc.).  Frustrated because of one design choice Blizzard  made that makes life tedious: unlike Diablo, Diablo II does not save the  state of monsters and items in the dungeons. When you fire up a saved  game, your character is back at the starting town for that Act, not in the  middle of the dungeon where you left off.  This may not seem like much, but  it is an incredibly tedious change from the first Diablo for somebody who  doesn't have a lot of contiguous time to play computer games.  As a father  of two kids, I do not have much time to sit in front of a computer, so I  grab what time I can spare: a half-hour here, an hour there.  Blizzard's  design decision means that at least the first 15 minutes of any Diablo II  session are spent just getting back to where you were.  If you only have 30  minutes to spend playing, don't even bother booting up the game.  Sure,  they put in waypoints to teleport you around, but with the monsters  regenerated you still have to spend a lot of time battling your way through  territory you've already been through, and some of the waypoints are out in  the middle of a level so that when you teleport in you're instantly  surrounded by monsters.  If you are playing a Sorceress character, like me,  this is a potentially fatal situation that you would never have let  yourself get into normally. Anyway, Diablo II is a great game.  The  graphics are excellent and more expansive than the first game.  The sound  is fantastic: awesome EAX 3D positional sound effects, believable voice  acting, and outstanding music which is very similar to the original  Diablo's music.  If you can spare 3+ hours at a time to play the game,  you'll love it.  Otherwise, I think you'll find that it is still a really  fun game, but a more frustrating than it had to be.	1
Diablo II has the "look and feel" of Diablo I but is an entirely different game.  It consists of 4 acts, each act with it's own quests, NPCs and monsters.  The graphics are simply amazing, although the game is only  available in 800x600.  It is MUCH more challenging than Diablo I ever was,  and there are different levels of difficulty (Normal, Nightmare, Hell).  The item variation is also incredible, with hundreds of items to find and  collect.  If you're planning to play multiplayer, you'll also be happy to  know that it is IMPOSSIBLE to cheat in Diablo II.  The Battle.net  "realm" characters are stored server-side, eliminating all ways  of cheating.  This is the best game of the year, and is easily worth your  money.	1
Definitely a great sequel to popular Diablo. Its very tricky to update the game enough to improve features and functionality and preserve the original theme at the same time. The folks at Blizzard North did an excellent job of it! Playing the Beta, the only problem I noticed was that the graphic  rendering was painfully slow. I am hoping that this is endemic to the Beta  version. It takes about 3 minutes for the game to load on a Pentium 450  with 128MB RAM and a 16MB TNT nVidia Video Card. Otherwise, the visual  and audio effects of the game are breathtaking and the game play is very  interesting and more intuitive than the original version.	1
major Shephard. Experience Half-Life's Lambda Complex incident all over again through the eyes of major Shephard, part of a squad sent in to contain the chaos that has erupted in the Lambda Research Complex.  First, play Half-Life. Actually, this game won't even run without it so you don't have much of a choice.	1
Although significantly shorter, with worse weapon-pacing, a lot less story and a lot of inconsistancy, Opposing Force manages to still satisfy through great gameplay and innovative new aliens.  No game will ever come close to the unmitigated brilliance that was Sierra's 1998 release Half-Life, so expecting a mission pack to come even close may have hurt public opinion for this game.  Not helping matters is the fact that for about the same cost you get a far shorter game.  Additionally, the weapons are all apprehended too quickly and a lot of the plot (which dissapears all too quickly) meshes with the original game.  In Op4 you are Adrian Shephard, a corporal sent in to eliminate all traces of the debacle at Black Mesa.  However, shortly before reaching the LZ your helicopter is shot down by weird creatures and you are separated from your squadmates.  The military has realized it's in over its head and pulls back, but you are left behind, trying to stay alive with other remnant forces.  Despite all the negative reasons i have listed above and the anti-climatic, seemingly rushed ending, this is still a very fun game.  It keeps some weapons and adds innovative new ones.  It keeps almost all the old aliens and adds brilliant new ones, and action sequences that are difficult and entertaining.  I would reccomend that anyone new to the Half-Life family purchase and enjoy the original first, but this is still a worthy game and highly reccomended to any Half-Life devotee.  6.5/10	1
This game is truly the greatest add-on for half-life, other than CS. I wasn't too thrilled with being able to play "bob"(blue-shift), but I couldn't wait to play this. The army always bugged the s*** out of me, and I wanted to be them. But it wasn't exactly what I expected. They could have made this 3000 times better if they knew that the problem was going on, not being thrusted into the action like everyone else. I wanted to be able to neutralize the threat, and the facilitators. Not have them be our crutch. and, you don't get good ammo/weapons in the beginning. It's annoying! But I enjoyed this.	1
This is actually a very good expansion for Half-Life. usually expansions stink, but this one is quite acceptable. Opposing Force takes you back to Black Mesa a one of the US Marines trying to capture Gordon Freeman (play the first half life before purchasing this). There is an extroidanary arsenal of weapons in Opp. Force and challenging new aliens that do more damage. If you liked half-life, then buy this expansion pack cause its really good. I do have one complaint: I cannot play this sucker online! i have a 500mhz Pentium 2 (its old, but still reads the data) and i have cable modem/high speed connection and it says some file differs from a server file! oh well, you can play single player over and over because its so fun and addicting. have fun playing! -patrick	1
HL: Opposing Force is everything the original Half-Life should have been. An FPS with a cooler hero, cooler weapons and somewhat less-annoying puzzles. The fact that you can guide other privates into battle (not to mention boss them around) is a nice addittion although the AI dissapoints a bit. In short, I liked most of everything about this game: from the opening sequence to the laser-aim pistol to the infrared vision (analogous to that found in Alien vs. Predator) to the new abilities the hero boasts. Valve has made up for the (often) boring Half-Life, whose only pro was the custom game option (such as this one). Worth the investment.	1
Your wait is almost over.  The BETA test is nearly through and everything seems stable. But is Diablo as good as all the hype?  Well, pretty much! The game is visually stunning. Detailed landscapes throughout.  BUT, 3/4 overhead view gets old. A change in game perspective would be  nice. All new music in the background with a few familiar elements.  The  music is better than in the original Diablo, but it's still there. It gets  tedious, but it's easily tuned out.  The sounds in the game have improved  and are eerily realistic. The most obvious improvement (in my opinion) is  the click-and-hold attack.  No more destroying mouse after mouse!  Simply  click on your target and hold the button down.  You will continue to attack  until your target dies... or you do. The interface doesn't take much to  get used to as it still resembles the old Diablo.  It is fairly  intuitive. But, you want to know about the characters and monsters, don't  you?  I won't talk about the new monsters, you'll just have to find out  on your own!  But I will say that some are quite easy to take down, while  others will take quite a bit of work!  The five new character classes  each have their own strengths and weaknesses.  The new Skill Mapping in  Diablo 2 makes you choose: Master a few a skills, or be jack of all trades,  master of none? One thing that has always drawn me back to playing Diablo  is the ability to create a private game.  Luckily, this is still in the  game, and better!  Now you can have 7 friends join you in the quest to  destroy evil.  You can be anti-social and social at the same time! Look  for new perks such as followers and your own private stash. I've already  pre-ordered my copy.  If you're comping at the bit for this title, I'd  suggest you do the same.	1
The first and main half-life game when I first played it I really enjoyed it, then I got opposing force, and it was to me a fantastic addition to the half-life mod collection! Finnaly, fight along side soldiers and as one, the marines that gave you trouble in the first game, you are now one of them! Opposing force is packed with new weapons and aliens, plus more advanced marines than the last half-life, use engineers to cut through sealed doors, the medic can heal you, and your friendly soldiers, but only for a limited time, besides the point, There is one thing that disturbes me about this game like the last one, the ending, NO not the adminstrator g-man again! He follows you everywhere, then talks to you about sending you to a place and the end! But, I would reccomend this to gamers who are half-life fans , and to the ones especcially who like marines! Graphics:Not much changed from the last one. Sound:New sounds, but not much changed. Control:Like the last gameOverall:A fun fantastic game! ps. Multiplayer rocks just as much in this one as the last main game as well!	1
Okay, after reading most of the reviews below, I'm going to break my review down into a list of pro points and con points. Pros: Excellent new aliens. From the one-eyed chicken-legged Shocktroopers to the bullish lurching sewer creatures, all new alien strains add plenty of much needed variety. There's plenty of them too, offhand I'd say that there's at least eight or so new enemies. Excellent new weapons. The sniper rifle adds a different slant on the large scale battles and the new alien weapons are great fun (except maybe the barnacle grappling hook.) The storyline is quite snappy too, with plenty of glimpses of the mysterious suited man and a few secret conversations that you can eavesdrop on. Usual high standard in terms of the graphics and sound. The alien noises/voices still make me jumpy when you can hear 'em, but they're hiding somewhere (those Shocktroopers sound just like Daleks too!) Cons: Some people say that it's too short, but for an add on pack it more than suffices. Clearing it in one sitting was mentioned below too, I'm good at it and played it on and off for a few weeks. However, the end monster and actual ending are both let-downs. The 'final battle' consists of a series of climbing ropes, using mounted laser guns and using your grappling hook over and over (and over) again. More like the Krypton Factor assault course than an pan-dimensional showdown. Iffy bugs. I have a Pentium 3, Voodoo3 3DFX card and 256 of RAM but the game 'stuttered' and froze plenty of times during music/sound sequences. Sometimes (especially in lifts) you get stuck on the floor and have to reset the game to get out. I'm not too sure about the AI either. Any friendly troops that you 'lead into battle' either refuse to follow you, charge straight into gunfire or shoot you in the back! Their average life expectancy in battle is about a minute or so. The bad guys aren't really the sharpest tools in the shed either, following basic patterns or causing you grief by being very fast instead of very smart. I didn't come across any of the epic battles I'd read about and was looking forward to. The largest team of men that I led into the fray was three. Moments into it, all three ran into an upturned container to be gunned down one after the next by a gleeful Shocktrooper. Like Half Life itself, the majority of the time you're frightened of noises and the dark rather than tonnes of aliens charging at you. The latter more regularly would be welcome, and draw the games out a bit. The best part is the sewer section where one minute you've got a horde of giant half-bull half-spider thingies thundering after you and just when you think you've time for a breather, an infinite amount of scythe-armed flea aliens start spilling from doors. Ok. So to summerize, Opposing Forces is a very worthy purchase that adds plenty of great features to an already great game. Not very long or particularly hard, but well worth money.	1
Half-Life: Opposing Force is the expansion pack for Half Life, But not by the creators of the orginal game Valve but by another company called Gearbox. To install this game you must have the orginal game half life installed on your system. You don't play Gorden Freeman here, You play Adrian Shephard a 22 year old marine sent to the black mesa to deal with the aliens and Gordon Freeman, He and his men crash into the black mesa and they are rescued by the scientists, Now he must fight his way out of the black mesa with the help of other marines, But unfortunatly the aliens are not the only ones he needs to deal with, The goverment has sent black dressed assasins to kill all the marine's, He needs to deal with them too, You could see gorden freeman too. The Level design is good but nothing compared to the superlative half-life level design which has an infinte replay value. While half-life started and ended on a tram, Opposing Force starts and ends on a helicopter with the same ending. Opposing Force is built on the same quake2 half-life engine, Almost everything from the main menu is the same as half life, There are many new weapons but not any cool weapon like the crossbow, Even the crowbar is not here. The Grenade is looks much smaller here, Maybe Gorden freeman has small hands or maybe Adrian has large hands. Many new monstors but none like Gronarch. Many new charecters but i did not like the new security gaurd, The one who opens the door to let Shephard out in the first level. Compared to HL the game is quite short and linear, The load times are quite longer and the story is quite unbelivable and some sences are very silly. The puzzles are good but most of them are inspired from the orginal game, In one level you need to kill a monstor the same way you kill the tentecles In the HL level "Blast Pit". I did not like all the silly jokes too (No aliens were harmed during the creation of this game), Gearbox this is supposed to be an expansion pack for half life not Quake. Just like thief you need to climb ropes too, But climbing and swinging ropes is quite badly done and not as easy as thief. Opposing Force is not an awful game, It is a very good game and a must for half life fans, But it lacks the great story, superb gameplay, great puzzles, level design, superb action and orginality that made half life so great. It does not live up to the expectations it created as the half life expansion pack.	1
Yep, Half-life was a great game.  But with this expansion, it gives you a whole other game!  You play as a different person while using a different arsenal of weapons and much more.  With a non-confusing way of play it makes you think without getting frustrated.  If you liked half-life, you gotta get this one. (For a good deal get blue shift).	1
You thought half life was a good game well you have another one right here to hit you in the face. This is another great game. It is just as great as half life. I like the thought that you get to be put on the other side.	1
One of a handful of decent expansion packs, this takes the original plot of 'Half-Life' and looks at it from the perspective of one of the 'grunts' sent to 'pacify' the disaster site at Black Mesa. That said, your original  mission becomes quickly subverted due to unforseen intervention, and you  find yourself rushing through a 'Half-Life' parallel universe, sometime  intersecting with the original game. It's essentially more of the same, but  shorter (a terrible shame), although you get an expanded arsenal, and some  useful allies. There's more of an emphasis on multi-character soldier vs  soldier battles than before, and at times this could easily have been  'Kelly's Heroes : The Game', such was the war film atmosphere. Whilst  'Half-Life' finished with a dissapointing trek through an alien world, 'OF'  sticks closely to reality (although you can beam yourself into 'Zen' if you  so desire). The tragic, tragic shame of it all is that you'll probably  finish it in a couple of days, as it isn't very big. Roll on 'Half-Life 2'.	1
I enjoyed "Opposing Force" even more than the original Half-Life! I thought it was better being an army grunt, and also having a much wider selection of guns and explosives. The best level would have to  have been "The Package", where you get to command a group of your  fellow soldiers through a literal army of black Ops people. As always,  could have been just as good without all of the gore. Also, this game had  plenty of coursing in it. I'm not sure why they didn't include this in  their rating, since it's obviously there. Just a warning to let you know  that the rating of 17 and up is properly given. Another thing I was  disappointed with was the plot. You never find out what happens to yourself  or Freemen, you never find out who the G-man is who tracks you in both  Half-Life and Op Force, and you never find out why the Government sent you  and your buddies in, and then decided to kill you with MORE army grunts.  Maybe I'm missing something here. I hope all my questions will be answered  in Half-Life 2. All in all, it's a game, right along there with  Half-Life, that is sure to became a classic very soon. So what are you  waiting for? Buy it!	1
Half-Life:Opposing Force takes place as your charecter being Adrian Sheperd. Arian is a Corporal in the army and is being trained for a mission. That mission leads him back to where Gordan Freeman was,yet not in the same places. During the game you once again see the G-man that just  appears somwhere and stands there clamly atching,then walks  away. Half-Life:Opposing Force goes to the places Gordan wasn't. You do not  fight on Xen anymore,butyou stay back on Earth and experiance what happend  while Gordan was gone. As the coporal,you command a squad of soldiers,but  you don't just start off with them. You have to find your friends for no  apperant reason. And the so called "Improved AI" i found  nowhere. During one point in the game you ahve a medic and and enginer.the  enginer opens a door and there is a drone gun waiting. Suddenly he runs  straight for the drone gun without shooting or anything yelling "We're  gonna kick your ass!".At that point he falls down dead because he has  just been pumped full of lead. Enemy AI isn't better at all. When you die,and  die again,and again ,and again you begin to notice patterns in EVERY move  the enemy takes. I got his game for Christmas,and beat it the same day in 4  hours using the meduim difficulty mode. That is how short the game  is. Half-life:Oppossing Force isn't a dissapointment though. It's a very good  game that should satisfy anyone that like Half-Life.	1
For the price, I expected this to be longer. It was very well done, however. Good new weapons, monsters, plot, etc.	1
This is one of the best platformers for the N64.  Ubi Soft created a game with realtime physics applied to all objects in the game.  The puzzles are excellent, and I had fun with the game for hours on end.  The game was extremely challenging, certainly not laid out on a silver platter.  I just wish there was more.  I hope to see Rocket return on the Gamecube.	1
with this memery card i could back up my memery saves because my brother loves to delete it i also used it to get extra cards in yugioh using the memery trick	1
It's unfortunate that you have to buy these cards second hand now. Sony will do anything to make you buy newer versions of their PS-3.that have had constant complaints from customers. There are a lot of Very Good PS 1 GAMES OUT THERE,AND YOU CAN'T PLAY THEM WITHOUT THE MEMORY CARD.wEITE TO sony AND COMPLAIN.	-1
My best advise is to never buy a memory card online! I couldn't save at all with out it needing to be reformatted each time. I suggest not to buy memory cards online.	-1
The Memory Card was exactly what was needed to save my Playstation games. It was orginal equipment from Sony. It works Great.	1
I like the story behind Grand Theft Auto.  It's a fun concept to play a game where you carjack and kill people.  I sort of keeps you sane by letting you run over them cops in a game so you won't have to do it in real  life.  The controls are a little weird because they are based on which way  you are facing instead of the screen.  I got comfortable with the controls  pretty fast though.  I love the huge cities to explore, that's a def plus.  I would recommend this game, you'll like it.	1
GTA2 is one of the best and most exciting games I've played in a while.  It's great. It brings the life of a gangster into your hands. You can hi-jack cars, collect the latest weapons, do mostly anything a gangster can  do. To tell you the truth it's not that much like Driver, and it's in my  opinion twenty times better than driver. Even if the graphics aren't as  good, the gameplay and action are better. The first time I saw this was at  Blockbuster and i just looked at the back cover and saw the graphics and  put it back down and rented Driver. In this game there isn't a moment to  sit still. It's a game where you have to be smart.  BUY IT!	1
GTA2 is set in a futuristic city where you try to earn "Respect" from gangs. Earning respect means killing their opposing gang. The more you kill,the harder a job you get that pays ALOT more than an easy job. Also doing jobs and completing them earns you respect too. This game says KILL,  KILL, KILL ,KILL ,KILL all over the box (well not really...).I think ive  said enough.	1
This seems more like Grand Theft Auto 2.0. Much of the gameplay is the same and the missions not much different. The graphics have improved and the sound is better but if you have the original then there isn't much point in buying this. As a stand-alone game it rocks. The radio channels are hilarious as ever and morbid sense of humor will no doubt appeal to most people. This game does not invoke violence in anyone at all so don't worry. When it was first released the slogan was "Study this game." With the word "study" blacked out. I guess this is because there was uproar over the first game. Man, if they thought that this was violent, they would certainly freak big-time over GTA3.	1
My sister bought Grand Theft Auto 2 (GTA2) a long time ago and I still play it. GTA2 is a game where you can do almost anything. You can jack cars from anyone including the police. The main point of this game is that you have to work for 7 ruthless gangs without getting your hide thrown in jail. The jobs start off easily but then increase each time you work for a gang. The harder the job is the more money you get. But, in order to work for a gang you have to show some respect. There are seven different gangs in the city and each of them hate each other. When you work for one gang then another gang looses respect for you then you gotta kill gang members from the gang that likes you then the gang that hates you will respect you so you can get another job from the gang that likes you. Well, it's kinda tricky at first but once you get the hang of getting respect from another gang it's pretty fun. There are over 100's of jobs and over 100's of cars. You can choose from armored lemos to tanks or even ice cream trucks! Also, this game is free. You can do anything to achieve your goals. You can put a bomb in a car and drive it to a gang's safehouse and blow them sky high! Almost anything you can do. That's why I love this game! If you love being the bad guy sometimes and love a game where you can do anything from getting chased by cops to working for dangerous gangs then get this game!	1
This game is definately the best one on my shelf. It never gets old. It's one of those games where you don't care if you beat it, it is still fun just roaming around irritating the cops, stealing cars, and running over elvis impersonators (very cool). Definately worth the money, and definately the best game I've seen.	1
This game tops off any Gangster game. The camera angles are perfect. Although it is actually slower then it was then the first one. The game play is much better and much more cleaner. This is a must game for anyone who has a taste for blood and likes seeing people getting killed in games. If your the total opposite then I suggest you don't buy this game. This game is 100% addictive.	1
Pros: 1.  Beautiful, immersive, atmospheric worlds.  Monumental architecture.  Eerie music.  Breathtaking cut-scenes.  Ugly, creepy arch-villain. 2.  For the most part, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to solve the puzzles. 3.  Great high-tech tools to use,  impressive vehicles to drive and fly, creative use of everyday objects.  When you pick items up, they zoom off the screen into your inventory with a  whooshing sound.  The inventory feature is exceptionally easy to  use. Cons: 1.  Some locations are too dark and murky.  I suggest that  for the very dark places, you might want to adjust the brightness/contrast  on your monitor to make it easier to locate the hidden goodies. 2.  Some  mechanical levers/controls respond correctly only if you move the mouse  VERY slowly. 3.  The game crashed a couple of times, and I never was able  to get autoplay to work. Bottom line:  A superior, very entertaining  adventure marred slightly by minor glitches.	1
Hello Rayman! Don't be fooled about the "for everyone" label on this game.  This is not only a truly amazing work of art, graphically speaking, but also one of the best 3D arcade games out there on PC. Character animations are done in superb quality, with a lot of details in conveying emotions with the animated bodies.  The environments are also crafted well, with excellent architecture that never makes you feel that you are running through a maze. Music is also a strong aspect of this game and is well delivered.  And sound effect is used with great effect. There are two points that must be noted.  First, this game is very hard.  I know a friend who downloaded a patch to make Rayman invincible... and he still couldn't finish it.  Also, there is no in-game save-game feature.  You can only save after a level.  Although most levels are "bite size" so you don't lose much progress if you lose, there are numerous occasions that a particularly difficult scenario would require you to march through the same terrain again, and again, and again. The PC version is different from others is that it features 5 languages, but no voice-overs.  Voices are done in the same way as the people in "The Sims" or the adults in Charlie Brown shows. It is an excellent game for kids who are looking for fun, and for young adults who want to switch from the usual First-Person shooter games.	1
If you're looking for a 3D PC Platformer then look no further. This is THE  game you are looking for. Its better than Croc 2 and has much better camera  positioning. It has a less kiddies feel to it than Croc 2 also. The  graphics are gorgeous and you get to do things like water ski. Still not as  gooas Mario 64 but then this is PC after all and Platformers are no longer  10 a penny. One tip thought for Voodoo3 users is that this game is FAST -  TOO FAST! so go to the website and get the patch to slow it down a  bit!! Throughly enjoyable - I wish there were more games like this on the  PC!! It gets 5 stars aa I cant think of a better game of its genre on this  platform.	1
Now let me tell you straight that Rayman is one of the best games I have  ever played!  With wonderous worlds, challenging levels, and memorable  charicters make it a game to be hold!  That where Rayman 2 comes in.  Gone  are all the great stuff I mentioned above, clearly a fatele mistake on Ubi  Soft's part.  We have none of the returning cast (Except for Rayman of  course), choppy 3D graphics (A lot of the graphics look like they were  painted on the game), and very little challenge makes this a tradgity!  I've had this game for little over three days and have unlocked all the  secrets AND beat the game!!!  The first had me playing for months.  And  when I was finished with it I shed a tear of joy and said: "Now THAT  was a game!"  I'm still wondering how this can be called a sequal,  it's terrible!  I'm truly offended by this game!  All those who praise this  game have probibly never played the first game!  I beg of all those who  read this reveiw, please play the first game first to see what Rayman truly  has to offer you!  This game is just a wasted game.  I hope Ubi Soft wises  up with Rayman 3 or I'll just have to shelf the game as "A game that  got killed, when turned to 3D."  Boo, hoo!!!	-1
A colony has suddenly evacuated its cities in order to avoid the wrath of an angry Ozgar. The player's object is to locate Ozgar and stop him before he destroys this planet. The colonists have developed a remarkable technology for hypertravel from one world to another. Through the course of the game, the player gains control of this technology in order to find and defeat Ozgar. By virtue of this narrative, the player is afforded the opportunity to jump freely (after gaining the technology) from any of four worlds. The worlds are quite disparate and very beautifully rendered. It does take some time and effort to obtain the technology, but the process of doing so is engaging, interesting, logical, and rewarding. There are very few non-player character interactions. In fact, in most cases an encounter with another character usually means trouble--some encounters result in a sudden "game over". This game, consequently, is a very solitary experience, with very little dialogue and with most clues being found intuitively and through exploration. I enjoyed this aspect of the game very much. Some reviewers have felt that the sudden "game over" encounters were unnecessary and distracting. Perhaps, but if you save often (as you should anyway), you can easily return to the gameplay, and the game makes it fairly clear fairly quickly that you should avoid ALL beings. Once the first serious encounter is made, the player is fairly well clued in that nothing about these worlds is particularly friendly. The scenery is just splendid. The worlds are very different--one lush and green, one arid and dry, one partially submerged underwater (and in which the player enters one building and goes several floors down beneath the surface of the water outside). The player's progress is extremely linear--most things must be done in a particular order, and in some cases the player may be significantly hindered if she has missed some element. However, the ease with which the player may jump from world to world more than makes up for the linearity. Exploration is multidimensional in this regard. Toward the end, I did find it necessary to go to a walkthrough online. The puzzles became to some degree inhibitive rather than contributing to the game experience. Once solved (by cheating a little), the storyline and graphics were rewarding enough for me to forgive myself my indiscretion. The final puzzle, I must agree with other reviewers, is unnecessarily convoluted and the end is rather seriously truncated. In this way, I was a little disappointed. I give this game four stars for its creative way of mitigating the problem of linearity by giving the player free rein (after gaining the technology) to explore several beautiful worlds; for its inventive artwork in rendering the worlds; for its pensive, solitary feel; and for its science fictional (as opposed to fantasy) concept. I give this game no more than four stars because I sense that it was cut short, because the linearity sometimes interferes with how much exploration the player may engage in each world, and because I felt it necessary to turn to walkthroughs in order to complete the game. All in all, I come away from The Crystal Key feeling mainly that I spent my time well in these worlds.	1
I found this game to be just so so. With computer graphics you'd think that they'd be able to make the aliens more alien. They remind me of stormtroopers in black armour. I feel this game was limited to 1930's stile imagination.	-1
I was so disappointed in this game.  It really had very little story line and the graphics were poorly done as well as the puzzles.  I may have spent 3 hours on this game from start to finish and continued to be disappointed with the ending of the game.  About all I can say about this game is that they tried...	-1
I do like pastoral games, but this one was just a shade too soporific for me. I got about halfway through before I realized that I just didn't care if the aliens destroyed Earth or not. Bad sign!	-1
As some of my readers know, I own a Playstation 2 after 6 years of original Playstation, and that I've kept all of my games from it. I'd consider myself a fairly experienced gamer, and one of the most challenging, beautiful and all out extrodanariy games for the Playstation has got to be the 2-D original masterpiece, Rayman!   What do I mean by challenging? Even after all of my best efforts and devoted hours to this title I still have yet to beaten it. Rayman has over 30 massive levels ( including bounus levels, ) with some of the most vibrant and imaginitive colored backrounds on each level which are layerd to look like they never end! And it works remarkably to make you believe that your in the shoes of that limbless lion-hearted hero Rayman out to save your world.   Rayman also offers deep gameplay and many moves, such as using his surfer hair for flying like a helicopter and his fist for powering up, grabbing nearby items, and firing out at enimies. He uses climbing and crawling technequies to acheive unexplored parts of any level, and can run and shrink to escape faster from threats.   Rayman adventures through many magical relams, which include Band Land, Blue Mountains, Picture City, Dream Forest, The Caves of Skops and finally, Candy Chateau. These worlds have their own quirky enimies and backrounds according to their themes, and have many passages a creatures to save hidden somewhere in them.   Many other sequals such as Rayman 2, Rayman Rush and Rayman Arena are all in full 3-D, but are never as fun ( don't get me wrong, Rayman's sequals on Playstation and Playstation 2 are good, ) or as grand of a spark as the original. Rayman sure has had many changes to appeal to his new generation of gamers.   Despite it's childish looks, Rayman has something to offer to any age and "breed" of gamer, and should belong on every Playstation owner's shelf.   Rayman was and still remains one of the greatest titles in gaming history, so if your intrested definetly pick up Rayman!	1
Rayman is a solid 2D platformer in the vein of Kid Chameleon and other sixteen-bit era jewels, with about a hundred short sublevels divided into five themed worlds. No plot twists here: shatter the six cages of captured Electoons in every level to confront the master villain and save the Great Protoon. The colorful, witty graphics and the action-packed, absorbing gameplay is where the game really shines. The packaging boasts four separate backgrounds running simultaneously. I haven't counted, but it seems true. The sprites are large, colorful, and expressive. What really amazes is the amount of interaction: you may find yourself dodging enemy projectiles, steering a floating berry, and ducking under swinging obstacles, all at the same time. Not to mention the minigames and the numerous hidden items. Rayman is a complete package, warranting at least a look.	1
This game might be 2D, about 4 years old (This game premeared on Sega Saturn), and the idea is kinda strange, but this is a GREAT game!  At first  it starts out quite easy (You'll beat the first 5 levels in less than 2  minutes) but soon you're wondering if there is a way to beat the game.  Heck, before you know it you'll buy the stratigy guide to try and figure  out what to do next.  This game has given me more of a challange in gaming  than Lara Croft did in Tomb Raider.  I highly recomend this game.  Now  where is a copy for Dreamcast?  Huh, Sega?	1
I bought this when I was in my "Adventure" mode. Several other games earned my dollar, such as Lightbringer, Gabriel Knight 3, Kings Quest 8, etc. This one, however, was not really with the $19.95 I spent. The visuals are beautiful. The gameplay is too linear however. You have to "do this" before you can "do that." There is no way to accomplish your goals in multiple ways. Whereas this concept was astonishing 3 years ago, it no longer appeals to the gamer. Another gripe: WAY TOO SHORT. If Al Gore had played and beaten this game, he would have demanded a recount and a re-recount. (LOL...oh, the political humor!) Buy this game only if you truly are a fan of mindless puzzles and rail gameplay. If you want a little more freedom in a game with a little more depth, story, character development and replay value, look elsewhere.	-1
As a Myst fan I looked forward to this game and was sure that since it was so difficult to find in my local store that it must have been great. Boy, was I wrong. I played through and found that the puzzles were pretty difficult simply because were totally unrelated to each other and the rest of the game in general. Running a PII 600 MHz machine the game gave me no problems and the graphics ran fine. I am not an extremely picky gamer and with a bit of a plot this game could have been tolerable. ... .	-1
How can you play PlayStation games without this?It rocks in making PlayStation games fun or boring. It can vibrate,let you play games,and you should buy it so you can play those games!	1
I have had my playstation in almost a year now and I had the Dual shock controller ever since I got my consol. I use it for all my games but I  think it is funniest to use in NHL 2000 from EA-sports. It is great that  you can feel that you are getting hit in the fights and that the controller  is really shaking when you have lost a fight. Furthermore the feeling when  you get a tackle on to the boards is quite funny. I have used the  controller for other games as well. And even though some the games are not  able to use the shock-function the controller is very good anyway. The  buttons are easy to reach, the analog control is well functioning and the  controller is nice to hold in your hands even when you have played for a  long time. All in all a good controller that can be used in all sorts of  games - but of course it is best in games which are enabled to use the  shockfunction	1
The analog controller is great for a lot of different reasons.  The vibration function is a really nice addition to the game.  It may freak out a friend who's not expecting it (which is quite fun to watch) and adds a  nice dimension to games that support it.  The analog controls are great,  especially for driving games.  The more precise control keeps you from  veering from side to side.  The amount of buttons and fingers used may make  people who aren't used to it uncomfortable, but that doesn't seem like it's  going to change anytime soon. My only complaint is that this control  isn't used enough.  Very few games call for the right stick.  The one that  I know of is G-Police, and it really adds to the game. There's no reason  to get a non-analog controller when you can get the analog.  It may cost a  bit more, but it's worth it.	1
Working perfect and in very good condition. Thank you	1

Totally hate this game.  Maybe it's because I'm over 30 and have very little patience for action platformer video games these days?  I don't know, but this game is exceptionally frustrating, to say the very least.  And I grew up on the old Nintendo, Super Mario platforming days.  This game is nothing like that.  It's extremely difficult, to the point where it does nothing to help my temper issues.  If you want to seriously throw your controller down the block, then get this game.  Otherwise, please do yourselves a favor and pass it up.  You don't need the aggravation in your life.	-1
cool!	1
One of my favorites!	1
Great game one to go back and relive my childhood. The soundtrack is amazing as well as the color work and game it self. Pretty challenging and slippery. And by slippery you'd know what I meant if you gave it a try.	1
Fun	1
I love it, Thanks	1

Everything was excellent. Thank you, ggulley10	1
Exactly as seller described it.	1
Works very well.	1
came in on time, works great, no issues and it looks brand spankin new :) :) :) :) :) :)	1
One of numerous old PlayStation games that were super fun to play. Glad I found this gem. Super happy. I haven't stopped playing it! Thank you.	1
This has always been one of my favorite games of all time. Ever since I was a little kid. :D	1
I used to own this game for the PlayStation One when I was younger, and I can still remember the levels and how long me and my cousin would spend playing this.  The game was pretty awesome for it's time, and is still pretty neat and something I consider collectible.  However as far as gameplay value goes, it's nothing spectacular in my eyes.  The game is difficult as all hell, no matter your gaming experience or age, and it just gets downright frustrating occasionally. But if you're looking to fill that nostalgic void in your heart, look no further.	1
It's a plain official PS1 DualShock. D-pad is nicer than the DualShock 2, but the sticks are looser and none of the buttons are pressure sensitive. Built solidly. Just a good controller.	1
Worked fine for me, would recommend!	1
If you like classic side-scrolling platformers, this game is definately worth getting. Its simple enough to just grab the controller and start playing but challenging enough to make you have to figure out what you'll need to do or get before you can go for 100%. Nice game and fun. This is a game I reccomend especially if you have little ones that come over often to entertain them with.	1
The original Rayman is perhaps one of the finest platformers that ever came out. There's a reason why this game has been re-released for some times (Not as much as Rayman 2, but still). That reason is...everything.  The game has one of the best soundtracks I've ever listened to in a video game. I can tell there were LOTS of effort put into this masterpiece. You can even put the game into a CD player and it would play the music!  Before there was Ly, Lums, Razorbeard, the Rabbids, or even Globox for that matter, there was Rayman, the fairy that created him, and the evil Mr. Dark. This was a platformer that just suddenly improved upon everything people loved about platforming games. It had great gameplay, catchy music (as noted), and amazing graphics that reveal hugely detailed environments.  As you start the game, you only start out with the basics: Running and jumping. But that as you progress through, you get newer powers, such as being able to hang on platforms, THROW your FISTS at enemies (Man, that's cool), and >GASP< being able to fly for a short period of time! Sure, later games have these powers as staples to Rayman's character, but back when this was the only game out, you have to work your way to get these....and you would have fun doing it.  The problem is that younger gamers may be put off by the game's difficulty. Yeah, it is challenging, but some find it to actually be TOO challenging. Nevertheless, this is a gem that you should buy in case you have a Playstation lying around.	1
Worked great nice to have for my older ps1 console!!!	1
Just fine! Definitely worth the buy. I needed to replace two that were lost (I, of course, found them a couple weeks later), and these were excellent. Now I have four, and it's actually kind of awesome. They work just as good. I was a little hesitant, because of some reviews, and then the fact that non OEM controllers have a reputation for sticking and buttons being less nice and such - and these are absolutely fine. Some of my friends cannot tell the difference, and really don't care which controllers they get/use.	1
I have spent more hours using this than some people have been alive for.  I found it simple, adequate and comfortable to hold for long periods.  I use it now to fly my plane, a simple stick is so boring.  The vibration feedback and buttons are a must in any aircraft.  No video game is as real as reality, that doesn't mean you can't integrate the two.	1
If you liked the old type of Sonic games on the Megadrive then you'll love this. This game is hard unless your talented at games like me. I gave this a five because of the grate impact on me as my first PS1 game with Crash 1. This is a 2d platformer(the way you move left or right)and I prefer it to Rayman 2 that is 3D(I do prefer 3D games to 2D).	1
It works exactly as advertized and is provides a better experience on my PSOne console than the original PlayStation controller I had with it did.	1
***UPDATE (3/7/16)***  I received a full refund for this purchase over the weekend in response to me negative experience with the product description.  I would like to emphasize the the controller works flawlessly on my PS1, and I would have had no complaints what so ever if I had purchased the controller for that purpose.  The controller arrived on time and everything else about my experience was delightful.  ***UPDATE (3/7/16)*** The controller works wonderfully on my PlayStation 1, but does not connect to the PlayStation 2, like the description reads:  Product Description PS1 or PS2 Dual Shock controller, works beautifully, clean, all buttons work, like new, ready to ship, perfect controller  I was disappointed at the fact that this did not work on my PlayStation 2 since that is what I was purchasing it to play on.  All the PlayStation 2 controllers work on the PlayStation 1 so I already had a controller that worked on mine, and I don't have any two player PlayStation 1 games right now.  This purchase turned into a useless accessory since it did not work on what I hoped to use it for.	1
Came in great condition!	1
Good	1

fast shipping. my son is happy with it.	1
Good product but sticky thumbstick. Nothing is unfixable. ..	1
If you plan to play old Playstation games on a real Playstation - this is the controller you are looking for.  A design that went largely unchanged for over a decade and a half - there is no better way to play on the console.  Note that DualShock 2 controllers will not work on original PSX hardware - but these will work on PS2 hardware (albeit without the pressure sensitive buttons).	1
Um it work good and ok with playstation to use that as no break or damage or whatever. Ty much	1
ps1 grey controller is the one which never gets old, if you properly and carefully will own it. first, original as always the best choice.	1
I am getting back into my old ps1 and needed a controller. This was cheap and works great. I got a used one and it works great.	1
in great condition and work perfect i love the psx and the dual shock makes all the difference in the world.	1
This is the controller I grew up with. Same old moving capabilities and works great with racing games. This is a must have for any playstation addict.	1
This product was of course very helpful since the PS2 I bought didn't come with the controllers. It functions very well and seems to be in pristine condition.	1
Not much to review here seeing as it's a PS1 controller. It didn't come shrink wrapped in a cardboard box or anything but it looks new and works well. I found my old first-model PS1 in my closet and found all the wires except for the controllers. Now I just need an SDTV because the PSX looks awful on HDTVs	1
Great controller, no bends, twists in the cord, no folding over of it at the top of the controller, that is common among those of us who wrap the cord around the controller. The joysticks still have proper tension and no scuffs/scrapes anywhere. And most importantly, works great. Great replacement.	1
i remember for some ps2 games i used the ps1 controller for it.  the controller for the ps2 and ps3 did not chande much.  these are great i love them.	1
this is a good company to buy from if you have a problem don't do what i did and not answer your email. I made a mistake and gave a bad review without looking first. but they resolved it and now they deserve a good review, so buy from them, if there is a mistake they will make it right. Thank you and to Game Kong, I am sincerely sorry.	1
If you've played any PlayStation console in the past fifteen years, you've more than likely used a DualShock controller. What else can be said? It's a good controller design. Works with any PlayStation.	1
It's the PlayStaion controller. C'mon, do I really have to do a review. You need it to play your games. The funny thing is, I used to prefer the controller that came with the PS, the one with no analog sticks, until I experienced the Dual Shock 2. I used to say "what is that, those big black lumps on the controller?? I'm not getting that." Aaaa man, the good old days....	1
Playstation's Dual Shock is such a comfortable and popular layout that PC gamepad companies like Saitek and Logitech try to copy it, and they usually don't do a very good job. Their d-pads are always too awkward, or their construction is too lightweight. The Dual Shock is solid and is built to last. I'm an emulation gamer, and thanks to SmartJoy's USB adapter I can use a real PS1/PS2 gamepad with ZSNES and Bleem.  My only gripes with the pad: A) The Start/Select buttons really should've been moved up after the addition of analog sticks. I'm always finding myself fumbling over the sticks trying to get to Start and Select. B) While the d-pad is very sturdy, it kills my thumbs after a couple hours of play. Kinda makes me wish they had taken a Turbo Touch 360 approach and used a touch-sensitive panel instead of hard plastic arrows.	1
It's a huge collector's item. It's rare. If you're a fan of Pokemon and have either of the original games (red, blue, or yellow) there's no reason not to buy this if you find it. Think of everyone who tries to collect all of the games, but they can't because this game is so hard to find.	1
I have been a Pokemon fan for a while and I ordered this, no regrets or dissapointments. This game was bafore they "Redone" the way the pokemon were animated in this game and alot of the pokemon will look different than they do in R/B/Y and so on. In the US we got this game but it was redone and is Pokemon Blue. Do not get this if you think it has different pokemon or wish to trade to American Versions,if a Japanese game is traded to an American version it will corrupt data on both games.	1
When I got this, there was only two flaws, two flaws which im kinda upset over, but no biggie I guess, when I bought this, it stated it was in "very Good" condition, but it came with horrific markings on it, I wouldnt consider this in "Very Good" condition, other then the permanent marker markings and writing on the back with permanent marker, the game seems in "Very Good" condition.  I tried to rub off the marker thinking it wasn't permanent marker but all that did was make it purple... so note to yourselves people, not everything comes in "Very Good" condition like they claim.  If it wasn't for the permanent marker, I would give this a 5 star.	1
Came in Near mint condition. The only issue was, no box. I would definitely recommend this game to people that have played through and/or beaten red yellow or blue. There are minor graphical differences, Which is why this was never released in the states.	1
Pokemon all started in Japan,in 1996 as Pocket Monsters Red and Green. Then followed by Pocket Monsters Blue and Pocket Monsters Yellow. All these games were hits,and made it to the US.  Red and Green only came out in Japan. Not the US. The graphics are much worse then the Red and Blue graphics. Many pokemon looked ugly,and stupid,so Nintendo made Pocket Monsters Blue. There Blue is our Red and Blue. The graphics for Blue,is the same as the graphics in Red and Blue. Some glitches were also fixed in Blue version,and was passed over to R/B versions. The only differences is the language. That's it. Pocket Monsters Red and Green are different from Red and Blue. Pocket Monsters Red is like pokemon Red,but different. Different dialogue,glitches,and graphics. The games became successful,and Nintendo released more games.  On TV TOKYO,pokemon became a Anime in 1997. It became a hit,and was followed by Pocket Monsters Yellow in 1998. Electric Solider Porygon came out in December 12,1997. The bright blue and red lights caused seizures,a symptom when something the human brain cannot take recations. It causes all sorts of sideffects. Many Japanese children got headaches. As well as eye strain,vomiting,bloody noses and bloody mouths. Over 600 children were rushed to the hospital. No one died,but we're hurt. It hit the news in America,and many people criticised pokemon. They thought the Japanese series shouldn't come out in the US. 4Kids still released the pokemon anime in 1998,and still became a hit. However,the episode never came out anywhere outside Japan,even with repaired animations. It wasn't Porygon,but Pikachu. Pikachu used a thunderbolt attack,which hit the missile,and caused the bright lights. It went on for 5 seconds,and caused seizures. Don't watch the episode. It's not safe,for kids anyways. What's this have to do with Red and Green? Well,a story like this with the games were very similar. Lavender Town Syndrome. This is a myth,not true. The myth is about the music from Lavender Town. The myth is is that children who listened to the music got headaches from the load music straining on the Nintendo GameBoy systems speaker. This caused children to kill each other. This isn't true. If this was true,there would have been news reports on it,and pokemon would have been bann. Including Red and Blue. No one died. It might have been annoying to listen to it,but nothing happened. The Japanese music is not the same as the American music. The American version isn't a strong. Anyways,pokemon still was considered violent. But,this has nothing to do with the Syndrome. It has to do with the Cards,Games,and Anime. Watch this one YouTube:Pokemon on the news. Look for pokemon news report 1999. It will talk about it. For one thing,they are all trolls. They all say pokemon wrong. They also say how violent and brutle it was. It's not a message of violence. It's clearly rated E for everyone for every box. Well sure,you go around catching monsters and they beat the crap out of each other,but really,it's not like there killing each other. They aren't. Also,the games are good to improve reading skills. It's bann from every single School across the country. 16 years later and it's still bann. Mostly the Cards. All for violence? Really? No. Not worth it. Well,4 months after the insistent,pokemon was back on in Japan in April of 1998 on TV TOKYO. Then,in September 8th of 1998,pokemon hit the US as a popular Anime.  But how about talking about the games? The games are the same as Red and Blue. Sharing the same Character's,music,plot,trainers,and towns. Want to know why it's called Red and Green? Red is the boy you play as. He is aiming to catch 'em all and become a pokemon master. He has a rival called Green who wanted to train pokemon to the limit. The two main characters are Red and Green,so the games were  named after them. Pocket Monsters Yellow came out to be like the Anime,was became a success. It featured Pikachu as the games mascot,he has his own voice,you can get all three starters,and has better graphics. Thanks to the popularity,Pocket Monsters Stadium came out the same year. It came of for the Nintendo 64,and it had only 43? Pokemon. It wasn't big,so in 1999,Pocket Monsters Stadium2 came out to have all 150 pokemon. Pokemon Stadium,which was made in 2000 in America is Japan's Stadium 2. Stadium in America has all the pokemon expect for Mew and Mewtwo. In 2000,Pocket Monsters Stadium:Gold and Silver came out,having all new pokemon. In America,that was Stadium 2. Pocket Monsters Trading Card Video Game was made,having fans play pokemon Cards on the go. This was released in 1999 for the Nintendo GameBoy Color. Pocket Monsters Snap came out in 1999,having the player take pics of pokemon in 3D. Pocket Monsters TCG came out in 1998,and was huge. There were tons of Cards to collect,and trade,which made them so popular. In fact,the Holographic Chazarid is really the one that was popular. It was so rare,so not many fans could find them in packs.  Thanks to Pocket Monsters Red and Green,pokemon became huge. For a game that was made in 1996,it's still fun. However,there's more to talk about. After the first episode of Pocket Monsters came out in Japan,Ho-Ho,a second gen pokemon was seen flying in the sky near a rainbow. Most fans have beaten Red and Green,and that wasn't one of the 150 pokemon. Nintendo announced Pocket Monsters 2:Gold and Silver. They were suppose to come out later that year of 1997,but failed. It wasn't until 1999 when Pocket Monsters Gold and Silver hit stores. These games were different then originally planed. There was many different pokemon designs,and towns,and route designs,as well as different graphics. Nintendo failed with this,and only 100 new pokemon were made. However,it was made for a more advance system,the GBC. These games had color,shiny pokemon,genders,New gym leaders,bugs fixed,two new types,Speical split,eggs,and registrationing items. It was a hit,and in 2000,Pocket Monsters Crystal came out with the choice of beging a girl,battle Animations,bugs fixed,more storyline with Suicone,and even a even with Celebi!!!! A new Anime,called pokemon Johto Journeys came out the same year as Gold and Silver,1999. Pokemon The movie 2000 came out in Japan in 1999 with new pokemon. Another moive,called Mewtwo Strikes back came out in 1998. These moives were in theaters,both in Japan and the US. Pocket Monsters Puzzle Leauge came out for the Nintnedo GBC,around when Stadium G/S came out. It was alot like Tetris.  In 2002,Pocket Monsters Ruby and Sapphire were made,and had more things,like double battles,new pokemon,pokemon contests,and more. Pocket Monsters Colosseum was a spin off for the 3rd gen in 2003. 3rd gen is when the series started to die down. However,with the help of Pocket Monsters Fire Red and Leaf Green,it made it more popular. They were remakes of Pocket Monsters Red and Green. They were hits,having everything,old,new. These games were released in 2004,for the Nintendo GameBoy Advanced. The same year,Pocket Monsters Emerald came out,as a squeal to Ruby and Sapphire and is suppose to be amazing. Pocket Monsters XD Gale of Darkness came out for the Nintendo GameCube in 2005,with a storyline of Shadow Lugia.  In 2006,Pocket Monsters Diamond and Peral came out for the Nintendo DS. This was many fans first pokemon games. They were hits,and sold around 16 million copies. In 2008,Pocket Monsters Platuim came out,as a better installment. It was much more fun then D/P. In 2009,something new happened. Pocket Monsters Heart Gold and Soul Silver came out as remakes of Pocket Monsters Gold and Silver. They were hits,letting you have pokemon out of there pokeballs,like in Yellow. They were the remakes for the 10th anniversary of Pocket Monsters.  For 2010,Pocket Monsters Black and White came out,it was a disappointment for fans. Thankfully,Pocket Monsters Black 2 and White 2 came out in 2012 as squeals. They allowed fans to catch more pokemon,and a inverter story. They are much better.  For 2013,Pocket Monsters X and Y came out worldwide,as the first Nintnedo game to be a worldwide launch. It was boring,in my opinion,and it wasn't very good. Pocket Monsters Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire came out in 2014,another worldwide launch. They were also not fun.  For 2015,Pocket Monsters Super Mystery Dungeon is coming out in fall of 2015 for Japan,and Hoilday season for the US in 2015. 2016 is the 20th anniversary of pokemon,so,maybe a Yellow remake or another Red and Blue remake. Then,a Diamond/Pearl remake.  For these games,they are classics,and are fun to play. If you can't read Japanese,or don't know what Red/Blue are like,play Red or Blue first,and memorize the game. Also,learn to write Japanese,to understand it better. Remember to buy handbooks. Anyway,good game.	1
Good game so far, it's just like the american versions, when you pick a Pokemon, your rival chooses its weakness (since this is green I picked bulbasuar and the rival chose charmander) I lost the first fight he kept going first with scratch and once he used growl 1 time my attack was very weak against him, I remember always in U.S. Red and Blue always winning (still own a copy of Blue and months ago I won the first battle easily) The plot for green seems the same, I know only English and Spanish, my Japanese is horrible so every time I see the Japanese texts I have no idea what it's saying. I noticed the best way is to try each move, save the game before you pick up an item and teach it to your Pokemon, save it after leveling up once or save it after leveling up a few times so when it learns a new move and it already knows 4 of them, you can see if it was worth teaching your pokemon and what the move does  So far I like it, I didn't get it for the lavender town rumor, you can just go on YouTube and listen to it with headphones to see your opinion.  It's funny cause since I knew this game was coming in the mail, last night I was playing Pokemon Blue with my headphones on, while playing pushing a boulder thru a hole in floor on Victory Road (on the bicycle) the bike music was still playing, and went back on the bike and pushed the Boulder and it was a random pokemon cry that sounded very funny (bugged out for a second lol) but I searched online and it's a glitch in victory road  Honestly didn't get this game for the lavender thing, if supposedly you get headaches and nose bleeds then go ahead and bring pain to yourself, I'm playing this game to see the difference between the american versions. The game is very similar, but it seems like they level up fast, and reading info about his game it seems like a lot of pokemon evolve faster.  If your a fan of Pokemon, and want to see the original roots, get this game!  If you never played Blue or Red, or at least Leaf Green or Fire Red, then you'll probably have a hard time knowing what to do in this game if you cannot read Japanese...  Overall, great game, 9.5/10 rating	1
Beautiful game! I needed this to complete my Pokemon game collection and it was worth it. Now I have all the Pokemon variety for life! If you can, buy it!	1
This. Is. AWESOME! Any huge pokemon fan will love this 'first-ever (unedited may I mention) pokemon game'.The product came very early vs. What it said it'd be here by. It was wrapped in bubble wrap and inside a "small" bubble wrap case. I'm not Japanese, but it's not much of a challenge of you already know the plot of pokemon red, blue, green, (maybe) yellow, fire red and leaf green. I know what almost all the important character a lines but most importantly the plot. I'm on my way to Misty's gym right now and I got the game yesterday. For some reason Charmander evolved very fast compared to my American Red version. Plus its interesting to hear the music changes from Japanese to American. It's also intresting to see the sprite differences. The hardest thing to do in this game is learning what moves are what, what products are what and maybe naming your character/pokemon. But again, if you are familiar with the other pokemon games I mentioned, you'll learn what the products are quick (though you won't know the Japanese) and its good to change how many you get of which item (ex. 4 pokeballs, 3 potions) and/or buy one and see what it does. With moves on pokemon you should test new moves on wild pokemon and learn what the animation is like to compare to the games I mentioned. I think most evolve, gain experience and moves with the same timing as the American versions. I have yet to see how bad the Lavender Town ("syndrome"**) music is (**if you know it has very high pitched noises to "invoke scared-ness" - it could give headaches if you CAN hear it). Maybe I'll come back with some more updates as I play.	1
I've been a Pokemon fan since Red, Blue, and Yellow, and have been waiting for an opportunity to get my hands on Green version for YEARS!  This version is basically the archetype of R/B/Y, following the same storyline, which (briefly) goes as the following: You're a young Pokemon trainer, working your way to become the "best that no one ever was." You travel through the Kanto region with your Pokemon pals, and train them to be the strongest they can be! With rivals and wild Pokemon, the journey will be a daunting and perilous one!  Pokemon Green version was only released in Japan, as Red and Blue became available worldwide. This is because Red and Blue had updated graphics, and they found that releasing Green alongside Red/Blue would be redundant (they are all basically the same game). For the most part, Blue version is the worldwide version of Green.  So, I'm assuming you're a diehard Pokemon fan, and you're curious about getting this game, right?  Why should you get such an old game?  Well, as I've said, its the very first Pokemon game! If you want to experience what MADE the entire Pokemon series, BUY IT!  It's actually really fun to play, because some of the tiles and textures are different, and you get the base designs of all the first 150 Pokemon. (Some are crazy ugly...its hilarious!) Some music also changed, and Cerulean cave has a more complex layout than in the "remakes."  Its just an overall interesting experience, especially if you want to see what started it all. :)	1
Many people think red and blue were the frist pokemon games. They aren't. Pokemon green was was the frist. In 1996,pokemon red and blue were made. But pokemon green was only in Japan. Pokemon green was the same just in Japanese. Some famous glitches such as missingno and mew glitch might not work the same in green as in red and blue.    Everything in green is Japanese. You would need a hand book to help you with pokemon names,moves,and types. Items will be hard to learn to. You don't have to learn how to speck Japenase,just learn how to read it. Once you can,It's the same as red and blue.    Pokemon glitches has been changed. The well known missingno cannot be used by the old man glitch.(That's how you get missingno in red and blue). The mew glitch,can be used,but It causes some glitchy effects. Like, the game will say strange things and it will freeze. There's one glitch called the door glitch that only works in this game. But sadly,I don't know how to do it!!!! But,I do know at the end you have to walk in front of Gary's house for 83-86 steps and on your 84 or 87,you go in the house and you end up in a route. I am not sure if glitch city works to. Most likely yes because red and blue are copies of green.    Also,pokemon in red and blue might be rare to pokemon green. Some pokemon like for example magmar might be able to catch in red and blue. But in green it's rare. Pokemon also look different in battle because of this being a Japanese copy which is completely fine.    Pokemon green is almost impossible for me to play:(. A bommer for me:(. But with practice I and many others will get used of it. If you want to name you character a name(Which by the way you have to). Get the alphabet of red and blue from the internet and copy the Japanese letters as the English letters. Make sure you don't make a mistake:). Same thing with naming your rival and if you want to nickname your pokemon.(You don't have to):).    So,this is still a great game just in Japanese. This game will make a fine collectable item too. A must have for any pokemon fan. GOTTA CATCH EM ALL:)!!!!	1
Game Plays perfect, everything as described.	1
It's pokemon green in Japanese! It came as pictured, not a cheap knock off. Saves/plays well with no problem. I can't verify if it's actually Japanese since I hadn't gotten around to researching it.	1
As a lover of the Pokemon series, I have played Red, Blue, and Yellow countless times. This game added the challenge of not being able to read anything due to it being in Japanese, but that was not a problem. Along with the fact that I could probably play this game blindfolded, you really only need to know how to read the healing items like potions and revives and the moves of your Pokemon. There are a few websites out there that can be used as a translation guide. This game was wonderful, and the difference in sprite-graphics for the Pokemon made me laugh occasionally. I'll definitely cherish this copy.	1
I love this game so much but my emulator fails. Good game though. I enjoyed it alot. It was fun.	1
So, if you're like me (and started out in the USA with the classic Red and Blue versions of the game), then you will know this game like the back of your hand. BUT, it takes a lot of effort to play this game. If you don't speak Japanese (or read it for that matter), then if you want to play this game, you're going to have a lot of research to do.  Pokemon moves will have to be looked up (what they learn, when they learn it and etc). Items will have to be looked up for their original japanese names and etc. This game might have to be played with some sort of guide over all...but, as I said before, once you get the hang of it, the rest is exactly like classic Red and Blue versions.  You have to remember that in Japan, they started with Red and Green. The Japanese 'Blue' version is actually unique only to that Country as it is a different game with new areas, and is something like a prequel to Yellow Version. This game would make a great gift to Collectors of the original game, but note that if you get this game, you will need the other Japanese Versions too in order to make things feel 'complete' (speaking from experience). Other than the language barrier, this game is still an amazing play :)	1
This game is one of the original three pokemon games released. However, Pokemon Green version was only for the Japanese release. If you cannot read Japanese, it detracts a little from the game. However, I found that that did not bother me as much as it could have. Still an amazing Pokemon classic.	1
When this thing was new it was certainly all the rage, but its main rival, the Sony Playstation was still a step ahead no matter Nintendo did.  Nintendo releases games like Goldeneye and Starfox, two GREAT games, but then Square and Sony release Final Fantasy VII to america, which certainly changed things.  On specifics, the N64 is 5 times more powerful than the playstation.  But the N64 cartridges hold no where near as much space as the playstations black CDs.  Why Nintendo didn't bother to use CDs as they originally planned confuses many to this date.  CDs last longer, and in truth, are harder to damage.  A bad drop on a tile floor may send fragments of plastic and silicon from your "F-Zero X" could be all over the kitchen floor.  Nintendo did have one thing going for it over Playstation, remakes of classic games.  With the 8bit Nintendo, they started some great games out.  Then with the 16bit Super Nintendo, they made 16bit counterparts to the 8bit games.  Now with this 64bit system, they made counterparts to the 16 bit games.  This was their edge, and it made the system sell very well.  In the long run was this systems downfall.  Games are much harder to produce for N64 than they are playstation.  Even though it it more powerful than the playstation, it is still second to it.  What will happen soon, is anyone guess.  Nintendo next year will release their new Gamecube.  Gamecube doesn't play DVDs like Sony's Playstation 2, and it doesn't appear so far to be anymore powerful.  Playstation 2 will be hard to beat for one, as you can see by it's current demand.  It seems that Nintendo has become the underdog, with giants such as Microsoft entering the race.  Perhaps they'll pull through, its unknown.  Sega's Dreamcast is certainly on it's way down, it will not be possible to compete with the much more powerful Playstation 2 and Microsoft's X-Box, and possibly the morepowerful gamecube.  Word to the wise, if you're planning to buy a top of the line system, I do not currently suggest this system.  Dreamcast is a good bet for the buck, but waiting a while seems to be a wiser choice.	-1
Plain and simple, this is the best game console out there untill Nintendo's next system comes out. It has by far the best games and no load times. Nintendo is #1.	1
Thanks to Nintendo's bright idea to make a system and double the graphics from the 32-bit Sega Saturn and Playstation systems, we get stuck with one of the worst sytems out there.  True Sega Saturn had lousy 3D graphics and  bad third-party support, no one can deniy the fact it had some great games  on it.  And I hate Playstation, but because they shaped their graphics just  right the games somehow came out looking better than N64.  Not only do we  get a really cheesy system, they also had to turn many classic 2D games and  turn them into horrible 3D games (Like Earthworm Jim 3D, Zelda, Donkey Kong  64, Kirby, Rayman 2, and so much more...)!  Plus the controll drove me  bonkers the way they controll it.  Sometimes the controll's bother me so  much I have to stop playing the game.  Plus because the games are in  cartriges (Lousy sound and space because of this) they cost [a lot]  and the games are usally short and don't last more than a couple of hours  before you're finished with the game.  And this is from someone who has  loved all their other systems they made.  Which is why I was crying after I  played this thing (I still think once was too painfull) at a friends house.  Complete waste of money.  I do not recomend.  Let's hope the Nintendo Cube  Box turns out better than this piece of trash.	-1
This is argubaly the worst system EVER. The music is horrible sounding comparing to the beauty of the playstation. There are no good RPG games for  this system. The graphics in most games are nowhere near they could be and  overall a pathetic system. The best game it had was Goldeneye 007 and in my  mind that is the ONLY good game besides Perfect Dark to appear on the  entire system during its 4 years on the American Market.	-1
one of the best video game systems ever made...  Nintendo should have made an N64 player like they did with the Gameboy player.  N64 games are great and you get the best experience playing them from the N64 itself.	1
very good	1
My original N64 was stolen from me, so I ended up having to buy a new one. And by "new" I meant just a replacement. The one I got arrived without any issues. Didn't come with the expansion pack but I bought one separately. The N64 had to have been the best system I ever remember playing. While it was the first foray into 3D gaming, all of the games seemed new and innovative, and the system had a pretty good longevity as well. When the Gamecube came out it was also exciting, though the N64 had all of what people would define as classics. Today, the existence of things like the Everdrive make it much easier to play games and homebrew titles without having to switch cartridges all the time, and serves as a more secure way to back up your save data too.	1
Nice collectors item.	1
Love it!	1
I love this game system. Had one long ago and didn't think I would ever find another that was so affordable and in great condition. Will definitely buy from this seller again.	1
Works well.	1
This game gave the opportunity to actually go to Jurassic Park... well, Site B, anyway.  The game plot was well written, if cliche, and works well as a Jurassic Park franchise.  When this game came out, the physics engine was revolutionary.  Today (2005), it will appear rather dated.  My one other complaint: too much shooting, too few puzzles.	1
Trespasser is not a good shooting dinosaur game. It's frustrating and you're wandering around going nowhere with a stick. If you get a stick as a weapon, you know this game is going to be really bad. Second of all, where the heck are all the dinosaurs? I see a dino on the cover, dontcha think there should be some in the game? What else is bad? Well, I don't even want to talk about the graphics. They look like something you could find on an old Super Nintendo game. The camera angles are just plain awful. Most of the time, you're stuck in a wall with your puny stick. Next, the controls stink. You have to press another button while holding another button to walk. You can't walk straight because of the bad camera angles, you end up walking off a cliff. Whoopee. I'm having a lot of fun holding a stick and walking off cliffs. The only thing that stops this horrible game from getting the dreaded 1 is the music CD inside. You can listen to 7 music tracks on your CD player, watch 5 music videos on your computer, and ignore the other crap on the CD. Now, most of the tracks on the CD really do stink. But, the Powerman 5000 video, Propellerheads' Take California, and the Propellerheads video Bang On! keep the track from being just as bad as the game. So, whoever made this game should thank the music CD because it kept it away from being really really really bad. Oh, wait it already is. 2 stars.	-1
This game has a reputation of being terribly bad. I feel differently, One of the most talked about problems is the control, lots of people are whining about not being able to control her arm and so on.... In fact the  arm control is very realistic and well done, its just that most people who  have adapted to not having to worry about controling anything and only have  to push the trigger. So they find the 'being able to control you arm' thing  hard and they give up because they'ed rather have it easy, im not gonna lie  to you, controling your arm in the game is difficult, but is finely done  once you learn how. Another problem people are having is with slowdown,  yes, this game slows down on slow machines, but if you have a pentium 2 400  or greater you should be fine, The gameplay is excelent and the  AI(artificial intelegence)on the dinos really shines, I think that this  game is good on a fast machine, and if you like real phisics and real life  type stuff, then you'll love this game. p.s. If you are a cheater type  person I would recomend actually trying to play the game before you wimp  out and use cheats, it is possible:)	1
This is not a game. It is manure masquerading as a game. Smelly manure.  I'm all for a "sense of wonder" but when that "sense of wonder" is bogged down by an insurmountable wall of bugs (bad bugs), an extremely clunky physics engine, non-existent gameplay, and a bunch of other gaffes who needs it?  This is an excellent box-stacking simulation but is nothing else	-1
Look, there's nothing I can say that can do this game justice.  Saying that the graphics are groundbreaking, the sound is excellent, and that it has an honest-to-<insert deity> plot that would actually make a  fairly decent SF novel just doesn't capture the magnitude of this  game. Go to the Interplay website and download the playable demo.  Afterwards, pick your jaw up off of the floor so that you can buy the full  version.	1
God I have never liked a space shooter as much as Freespace 2. The joystick is excellent when controlling your craft. You have a nice looking set of ships with good graphics to boot. At the time, pre-Doom 3, I thought they were they best graphics known to mankind.  The only problem is, to me anyway, is that the whole "realism" with controlling your space ship is a little too complicated, I mean, if you set the game down for a year and had to pick it back up, you would have to do the tutorial or memorize ALL the controls from the manual.  Anyway, it is a decent game, and if you have a lot of time on your hands, pick it up.	1
I just got a hankering to re-install this game. Freelancer got a little stale for me and Tachyon didn't have enough to keep me playing after I beat it. So after more than two years of not playing this game, I am finding it to be incredible. The graphics are crisp, sound is incredible, controls incredibly responsive, gameplay complex enough for me, and storyline is pretty darn deep (especially for a game of this type). Plus... the game can pretty much go on forever with the FRED2 editor and there are VAST numbers of community created mods, featuring both sorte missions and full length campaigns.	1
When I first got this game, I didn't know what to expect. After playing through the single-player campaign, I was blown away. The missions, the ships, the dogfights, the graphics, the storyline, everything is top notch. I would have to also say that this game is underrated. For all you FS1 people who have no clue about this one, it takes place 32 years after the Lucifer was destroyed and the Sol jump node collapsed, isolating Earth from the Terran civilization. The GTVA has been formed, unifying the Terrans and Vasudans. Suddenly, the Neo Terran Front, a rebel force led by renegade Admiral Bosch, starts a war with the GTVA over the Vasudan alliance. Not only that, the Shivans are back, but the Terrans and Vasudans have advanced greatly technologically in 32 years, and are ready to fight them this time around. Also, we find out why Bosch has rebelled against his people, and it involves the Shivans. As the story unfolds, his agenda becomes clear, and could have serious consequences for the galaxy.	1
Take 'Conflict: Freespace', polish up the already-gorgeous graphics, and you have 'Freespace 2'. Essentially a re-run of the original, this adds new ships, new weapons, at least one outstanding graphical effect (capital  ships now attack each other with 'beam weapons' - giant shafts of light  that cut through ships like a hot knife through butter), and some new  cut-scenes, all wrapped up in a sturdy cardboard box. At the risk of  souding boring, if you liked the original, you'll like this, as it's more  of the same - the controls and interface are identical, and it's just as  derivative of 'X-Wing' and 'Wing Commander' as it ever was, with an  emphasis on fast action and spectacular effects. It has absolutely no  depth, and very little replay value (the missions are often  tightly-scripted, and replaying them is often quite dull, as you know  exactly what's about to happen), but it's the best combat flight simulator  on the market. One tip - try and play the original first, as this game  doesn't usher you into the flow of play gradually, it drops you right in  the thick of things from the first mission.	1
Where to start...well, I know I won't make a catch all neanderthal statement to the effect that this is the best game ever, (that is until the NEXT best game ever comes along), because it isn't. Freespace accomplishes  many things by providing a solid story line to back up very impressive game  play. Where Freespace might lack is in two small areas-lack of creativity  for naming of vessels within the GTVN and the fact that no military  structure would allow or stand for the sniveling and back talk that gets  carried over in the com-traffic between fighters and capital ships. But  these are minor quibbles to what lies in store for the player.  Freespace 2 offers an expansive campaign with several missions that lead  you from a civil war led by Admiral Aken Bosch (voice of Ronny Cox from  Robocop & Total Recall), and his Neo-Terran Front faction to a  resurgence of activity care of the Shivans, whom Bosch has somehow brokered  a deal with. Where the missions shine is the player is never lacking  anything to do, and the game borrows from both the Wing Commander and Star  Wars games in mission design. However, unlike the other space combat sims,  Freespace 2 never suffers from the worry of having to be all over the map  in order to accomplish a mission.  The flight model is much improved  over the original game, though I think the GTVN fighters could be a little  faster, even without the afterburners. Flight dynamics are second to none,  the ships responsive, especially with a good joystick. Fighter choice,  weapons and missiles are in good supply, and each have their different  effects, though I would have preferred a little more discretion in  outfitting my fighter in early missions.  Graphically, Freespace 2 is  very strong, whether it be the detail on the various fighters to the  overwhelming scale of the capital ships, especially the Sathanas-class  juggernaught (which I think gains its inspiration from the Vorlon vessels  from Babylon 5). However, it's the little things you notice that really  make the game, like when you fire at ship and miss, your weapons' discharge  flashes over the ship hull with a visible light effect, the visual and  aural effect of a capital ship's flak guns as you do a strafing attack  across it's surface (you quickly learn how to skin dance across the hulls  of these big beasts) or the spectacular nebula effects of the later  missions as you pilot your way through pea soup-like gas clouds.  Ship  design is also better than in the first game as they play up the more  insectile forms of the Shivan fighters, whereas in the first they resembled  awkwardly placed slabs arrayed in different angles. Human and Vasudan  fighters are a mixed bag, but they all have a functional look about them,  and have much less of a polished look than either Wing Commander or the  Star Wars. Boiled down in it's essence, Freespace 2 is a solid shoot-em-up  type game, carried on thanks to a solid game engine, and exceptional  graphic design and terrific 3D support (I have 16 meg Voodoo 3000). This is  all enhanced by a great interface that doesn't over complicate the flow of  the game or game play.  This is not the best game ever, as no game can  claim that crown. However, it is the best of the current crop of space  combat sims. It easily outclasses X-Wing Alliance, and I feel that Lucas  Arts really needs to rethink how they design their game missions, because  in XWA, you are flying practically the same missions you flew in X-Wing  & TIE Fighter. Freespace 2 gives you a vast playground that is not  merely beautiful, but ultimately function and very rewarding.	1
By now some you have already heard of or read reviews of FreeSpace 2, the sequel to the excellent Descent: FreeSpace-The Great War which was published by Interplay back in 1998.  There aren't enough adjectives to  describe this magnus opus but here are a few: breath-taking, immersive,  nonpareil, magnificent, astounding, absolutely brilliant.  First things  first: FreeSpace 2 requires a Pentium 200MHz with a 3D accelerator card  that supports either Glide, OpenGL, or Direct3D.  I recommend at least a  Pentium II 266MHz or higher and about 1 gig of hard drive space.  The  game's high resolution artwork supports 1024x768 in 32-bit color and the  standard 640x480; 800x600 need not apply. The game picks up 32 years  after the original.  The Terrans and Vasudans (the original enemies from  the first game)have formed an alliance called the GTVC but a group of  renegade Terrans called the New Terran Front have begun to shake things up.  It gets worse: the nigh all-powerful Shivans make a return from the last  game as well and add more fuel to this cosmic conflagration. As a GTVC  pilot you will get to fly new Terran and Vasudan vessels as well as engage  in epic dogfights against new Shivan craft.  Locales now include nebulae  which interfere with your ship's instruments but also your enemies'  too. This game has to be played to be really appreciated.  On the  hardware side of things EAX and A3D audio support are present and accounted  for as well as force feedback.  And to make things even merrier Interplay  has recently released the game.  It's called FreeSpace 2: Sci-Fi Sim of the  Year Edition and it has 20 additional levels, which brings the total number  to 50.  There's also high resolution wallpaper and a few other goodies not  found on the original CD If you have even the faintest interest in  computer games, or enjoy playing hardcore sci-fi sim combat games, then get  FreeSpace 2.  It will totally rock your world.	1
Both work fine, packaging was dicey, but, it made the journey.  "They don't make'em like they used to." The Controller works, the system works and I'm  Very pleased.	1
Go to pro goods store; even if you have to spend a lot of money compared to the used N64 consoles, they are guaranteed to send a working consol with everything you need. That way you don't have to buy everything in parts from different people, trust me you don't want to deal with what I had to deal with. It took me a month and 4 days just to play the games I want to play because it takes so long to buy, wait for shipping, and repeat with every piece plus the game. Just buy the new consol from this store, get all the parts you want and have some games on the way at the same time, it will he worth the money.	1
it is my favor game system.	1
Bought my N64 from Misfit Games and Comics. Let me start off saying this. I was expecting the console to get to me beat up, dirty and aged. After all it is a 20 year old Console. When i opened up the package this thing was in prestine  Condition for being marked as used. It came with power cable, av cable, and an original controller. The cool thing about this is the stick of the controller had little to no play in it whatso ever, this thing had barely been used, very uncommon today to see one in this condition. i was expecting to have to get an aftermarket stick. ( which i will once steelsticks are in the market) the only thing i can say that didn't make this purchase 1 of a kind is the fact it did not have an expansion pack, just a jumper pack. but that is ok. seller did not mention it would come with the expansion anyways so i knew what i was getting myself into on that. I cant wait to get this thing all hooked up and playing goldeneye again. winner winner chicken dinner	1
As I'm unable to "fully" review this game, let me just say, the game is not compatible with WIN XP.  If you are lucky (or foolish) enough to still be running Win 98, then you may be able to get the game to load.	-1
This is the best Star Trek simulation I've played (and I've been looking for a good one since the early 1980s).  Many ship designs (and the ability to customize them), several races to play, good graphics, and well-done music and sound effects.  Nothing like catching an enemy in a tractor beam and slugging it out while transporting marines onto his ship.  The tutorials are also very informative. There are some problems with the game, though.  In one of the federation scenarios, I couldn't win without sacrificing a ship (though I should have been able to use a tractored enemy ship as the sacrifice).  The game is a first-class flight simulator, but not much else.  You don't really get a sense that moving about the galaxy changes the game in any meaningful way.  Also, even though you have crew members who have names, they are nothing more than statistical probabilities that can help or hinder game play, not communicative crew members.  After finishing all of the scenarios (which I have not), I imagine this game does not have much replay value beyond customized skirmishes that you can create.  Altogether, the price of this game makes it a good value, and probably one of the better games in the Starfleet Command series.	1
The problem with Star Trek games is that they try to be too much like Star Trek. Sound confusing? It is. To break the mold, Star Trek producers are going to have to lean on other designs because the way they make their games now just isn't getting it done. I mean, how can one series of games, with all the countless titles, all be so mind-numbingly below average games? The problem with Starfleet Command is ambition. The game boasts true 3-D combat. This isn't true in the slightest. If you want 3-D space combat, go buy Homeworld. Starfleet command is on two axi, the X and Y. No mention whatsoever of the Z axis. Everything is played on a flat plane. Now, I'm no expert of space travel, but this just isn't accurate, nor does it make for an enjoyable experience. Don't expect to use your torpedoes with this game either. They miss almost every time you launch them. And it isn't because of anything you're doing wrong: they just miss. The game is also very hard to figure out in its ship setup stage. If you want to load certain shuttles on your ship, you actually have to tell the game to NOT load them to get them to be there. It is backwards thinking, and I cannot believe that they shipped the game with errors in the interface like this. Overall, it isn't terribly bad, but is not very good either. It is better than 2 stars but not quite at 3 stars either. I'd rate it 50%. It has some nice features, such as being able to command a starship and be in charge of every feature of that ship, but you soon find that, with the absense of hotkeys for most parts of the ship, this game turns into a micromanagement simulation when you don't have time to micromanage because you're being shot at. The AI is generally dumb in the game when they are isolated, but some missions can be near impossible, and combine that with the fact that your "wingmen" do not do anything helpful, it can be very frustrating when trying to destroy over 30 Orion Pirate ships in one certain Federation mission. That's just it: some missions are impossible to beat, and the strategy guide does not help in the slightest. To make a long story short, I played this game for about 10 days, then uninstalled it on my hard drive and sold it in an online auction. The game just does not deliver what it should for what a starship combat simulation should.	-1
Well, bugs, bugs, an more bugs ! Fun game to play.....a little bit on the boring side at times. Game play is ok, interfact is good ( read the book!) But it a WAY TO EASY to "win" I give this a high rating because it is fun to play, an I am a big fan, but this is a game that people should take a little time with an make sure that they get the updates.	1
I really want to know who it is out there who seems to think that because you slap a recognizable name like Star Trek on a product and sell it is all one has to do. I also want to know how it is that two completely separate game companies, Interplay and Activision, can produce two separate games  (Starfleet Command and Star Trek: Armada) that work almost the same and  reek of the same shoddy workmanship. It is products like these that make me  realize why I have abandoned Star Trek fandom in the first place. Because  like Deep Space Nine and Voyager, they are so lacking in the creativity  that made the franchise so worthwhile in the first place.  Starfleet  Command-a space combat game by Interplay (Quicksilver), is so bereft  intuitive control that it becomes a laborious task to make any ship you  control do anything useful. Case in point, in my first mission with my  frigate sent after Orion pirates, it took me 15 minutes just to hammer down  the enemy ship's shields and constantly fiddling with my ship's weapons  systems just to get it to fire at the Orion. Of course while all this is  going on my frigate is endless rotating and turning all over the map. Why  should it be harder to NOT do something than it is to do something. At  least in Armada you can simply drag-and-select your ship(s) and click  elsewhere on the map to get them to go there. In Starfleet Command, it  takes so long to get your ship to do anything that I was given to wonder  why I had to select crew members for my new ship in the first place.   And why, in the year 2000, with all the great computer games out there and  the high level of coding in those games, are we still playing so-called 3D  space combat games in 2 dimensions? I do not care if they is based on the  Starfleet Battles board game, I played that to and realized that it was  limitation with it as well. Why is it so hard to work in the 3rd dimension  and enable the player to go `Up' or `Down'? We live in a 3 dimensional  world and as Homeworld proved, it's easy to control, because the  programmers made an interface that was simple and intuitive as well as  functional. I am also given to wonder why people are not more critical  about products like this when they are so inferior when compared to similar  programs. If you comparison shop for a car, why wouldn't you do the same  for a piece of software. It isn't like Starfleet Command is the only one of  its kind. It is your money afterall.  Just because it has `Star Trek'  tacked on to it does not automatically make it good: Remember Star Trek  Voyager? Maybe my standards are too high or maybe I shouldn't feel ripped  off for spending $... and having the pervasive sense of not getting my  money's worth.	-1
Works perfect. Looks great.	1
Game console good condition ! Thank you !	1

Just had to get one to relive my childhood. So glad I did.	1
It works just the way it should. This was the console itself, with no wires or extra things. Absolutely no problems with the thing.	1
no problems	1
nostalgia out the wazzoo	1
Exactly what I wanted. Works 100%. Perfect condition.	1
Arrived in operational condition and I can now enjoy my N64 Classics as they were meant to be!!	1
This system came as advertised and works like a charm.  Plugged it in and it worked first try.  I also liked the custom paint job that came with it as it makes the console stand out a bit.  Overall it was a good purchase and I am extremely satisfied.	1
Came as described so the sticky button is no surprise	1
I had great memories with this game system. WWF No Mercy, Wrestlemania 2000, Super Mario 64...so many great titles on this system. The only complaint I have is the awkward controller. I mean sure it works, but Nintendo needs to stop with the gimmick controllers and just stick to the basics. Anyways this is a great console to own and there are plenty of games to collect for it.	1
Works great and so far I've had it for 9 months and it works like a charm!	1
Yes.	1
It's just a regular N64 but gold, what's not to like.	1
Arrived quickly and as described. I am happy with this purchase. Thank you	1
Great	1
gooooooooold	1
horrible system... Graphics suck. Get an xbone... COD is way better than these crap games. Xbone and ps4 are a go DONOT BUYYYY	-1
I needed to pick up on N64, because there are so many classic games I've never played because I was too young to play or just games I didn't end up finishing.  Here's to retroactively living the gaming childhood I missed :]	1
love the system	1
Please hear me out. Let me try to explain why I gave this system such a low rating.  Had this console not been remembered as being fantastic and interesting, I would be giving it 3 stars. But, unfortunately, there really isn't anything very interesting about this console. The graphics aren't very good compared to the PSX or even some of the better stuff on the Saturn, like Panzer Dragoon Saga or Virtua Fighter 2, the Shenmue Saturn demo, Sega Rally, and Daytona Championship Circuit Edition, to name a few. Lots of games I've played have very low resolution textures, often sprawled out. The games themselves just aren't very interesting or fun to play, even in multiplayer.  I'm also not a huge fan of the controller. While it has an odd design, it is fairly comfortable, and the joystick is very precise.  Finally, there's the value. The games themselves are not at all worth the high prices they demand. Super Smash Brothers simply isn't as fun as Powerstone or Bushido Blade. Mario Kart 64 isn't as much fan as Ridge Racer Type 4 or Crash Team Racing. Mario Golf is nowhere near as good as Neo Turf Masters. Hell, even Mario isn't as fun as the Crash Bandicoot games. And just about all of the games listed (with the exception of Powerstone 1 or 2) are all marginally cheaper than their N64 competitors.  For the final verdict, this is a system I would recommend avoiding. The prices are far too high for their own good, and the games aren't good enough to justify the prices. If it hadn't been for the huge disappointment all the games I had brought me, this would have a higher rating.  Take off the rose tinted glasses people.	-1
Excellent condition	1
would recommend it	-1
Glitchy, bugy, chock full of errors, and lacking in originalty at points. Yet so addictingly good. Fly a copter and do missions in the janky world. Drop people in the ocean & watch them drown just because you can. Strive for the best copter with all of the enhancments Get extra money & tear gas the sick guy your trying to save. rescue people from burning buildings only to drown them in the ocean. the possibilitys are endless. In fact I feel an itch right now to bounce some poor pedestrins off building corners with a long dangly rope.  Hope you have fun.	1
This game was released in 1996!!! I bought it when it was relatively new and I had 3 children (2 boys and a girl) from about 9-13. I already had the SimCity game (whatever was current then.. I think 3000 Unlimited..) It's difficult to trace my entering SimCopter Fandom with this game, but enter I did..  First, even in 1996 its graphics were hardly awe-inspiring, but it had a few things really going for it. It computer-generated textures (one of the early games to do so) and it would use the cities and countrysides generated in SimCity and let you "fly through them". And it runs on the most primitive pc, requiring very little in the way of computer resources.  At first I was tentative.. what's this? The idea, aside of just touring your "own" cities, was to earn money by "helping out" with fire, traffic, crime, medical, passengers, etc emergencies by either directly intervening or by calling and directing appropriate response teams.. fire, ambulance, police, etc. These activities form the structure of the "game".. ie get money, buy better stuff, etc until you "made it" to the ultimate choppers.. even allowing a military unit where you can challenge UFO's.. And of course true to games of that era, it also has an "easter egg" or two tucked away..  And what are these "citizens".. at first you thought they "forgot" to finish the game graphics.. but then the genius of "vague" graphics and mumbling "speech" that you thought might be real.. but no its just noise! And what are these animals too.. But then I find myself admiring the "contextual" beauty of it..  and they have expressions as well.. I don't speak a foriegn language, even though I've traveled and know a few words here and there, I expect this game "translates well" to most any language. Just as you watch your pet's mouthings and actions, and you SWEAR you know what they are saying.. lol..  True to all Will Wright games, it is non-violent, eco-friendly, problem solving.. this is no exception..  And like most Will Wright games, there "just isn't much to it".. and yet.. IT BECOMES A CLASSIC with diehard followers.. and I'm one for this game.  It has a charm, a wit, and a pleasant, thoughtful presence that appeals to a wide number of people of all ages and with different styles.. Sure you find those "naughty" things you can do like run over people, smash into building, jam up the highways, and throw "patients" out of the helicopter... great emotional vents in those moments of frustration or boredom.. but the basic game somehow holds to a "gentler, kinder" essence.  My kids all spent many hours as well.. it is just fun without your having to invest a lot of painful brainpower.. :) It requires very little learning time, and is even fun to learn as you go. In the final analysis, as suggested by reviewer "ribcage", it boils down to a great, pleasant way to pass time.  edit: One warning however... You can only use Simcity 2000 (yes it's that old..heheh) cities to "tour".. I'm pretty sure it cannot use Simcity 3000, Simcity4, Rushhour and Deluxe versions. I believe there are conversion programs that can move the maps at least (though probably  not the buildings) back and forth. It does come with 30 or so cities "prebuilt", so this isn't required. Of course SC2000 is still available not only alone but in various collection editions with other SC versions.  I see this game from various sources such as "bargain bins", "recycled" software shops, etc.. I'd say if you can find it for a few bucks (including shipping) GO FOR IT.. its great fun and relaxing too.. Just one of those whimsies in life.	1
Love this console, a little too much.  Have to wipe it down fairly regularly.	1
The graphics are bad, there are plenty of bugs to go around, and in the end, there's not all that much you end up doing in the missions. But somehow, this game is super fun.  Maybe its the fact that the graphics are slopped together to the point where you kinda think they're kidding around. The people off the city are all freaks, and you and they make all sorts of real noises. The noises the pilot makes when you walk towards water or near the edge of a buidling are hilarious.  Even though, there's not really ALL that much to do in these cities, you probably won't notice it too much. All the stuff is pretty fun. You get to put out fires, rescue people, chase down speeders, etc. A fun little thing is that when you transport people, if you start to descend as fast as you can, the little displays of them in your chopper show them getting all flustered and scared. Classic.  I wouldn't exactly say that this game is "so bad it's good", because it does have appeal. The gameplay is good for killing some time.  I guess that's what this game boils down to. An extremely fun time-killer.	1
REALLY A FUN LITTLE GAME=NOT THE GREATEST GRAPHICS BUT THE FUN FACTOR IS A 10=LOVE FLIGHT SIMS AND WHILE THIS GAME IS REALLY NOT A FLIGHT SIM, THE GAME HAS LOTS OF THINGS GOING FOR IT=AS ONE OTHER REVIEW I READ BEFORE PURCHASING THE GAME STATED THE FUN MAKES UP FOR THE LACK OF GRAPHICS=I AGREE	1
Great, love this, shipped on time. I recommend	1
Was exactly what was to be expected and works like a charm!	1
It works and my sister loved it.	1
Very satisfied with the console, but it took minor cleaning	1
This game is great for a break from writing a report or studying. My aunt owns her own caffe and loves this game.  I guess to say if you have any intrest in buisness you will love this.  Its easy to pick up and the only thing you have to worry about is "what time is it ?!?" or "how long have I been playing this!?!"	1
I own this game.  I have gotten a 5 star rating once but it is dumb because if you run out of money and go into debt you can't get your money back or build anything.  The people get impatient and stressed out and then they start taking your money away.  I would recommend that you buy Spider Man or the Spider Man Movie Game instead of this annoying game that never ends.	-1
Everything works like brand new. It was only the system so I bought an A/V cord and power supply, controller and 5 games and everything works like a charm. While reading the reviews I see a bunch of people are either really unlucky or just really picky. I either got lucky or have low expectations cause everything works like the day it was first bought.	1
awesome	1
I really had my heart set on Toy Commander and when I got it, the game just didn't deliver! The game concept is really cool on paper but it didn't translate into a good game. The jerky camera which comes as a result of the poor vehicle control actually makes me sick everytime I play it! Control is so important in any 3D game and this game just lacking, big time! The multi player mode is also disappointing as the small vehicles get lost among the colourful stages. The game is just not fun! The graphics and the sounds are great but the game is just lacking in the fun department. I'm sorry people but the bottom line is that you can pass on this game and be quite contented because you saved a couple of bucks.	-1
We all played with toys when we were younger. Well thanks to the Dreamcast, we can all play with toys again and not feel guilty! Only this time it is war! You control planes, helicopters, tanks and other vehicles through missions around the house. Your objective; defeat the Toy Commander! The game begins with training missions to sharpen your skills. You will need it. Then it is off to the missions. The controls take a few tries to get use to them, but are easy to master. The graphics are surpurb! It really looks like you are in a toy world house! The game play is good. I would say excellent, but some of the tasks are pointless or seemingly impossible. But this does not ruin the game. It is still hours of fun! It can also become addicting! All in all, 5 stars is deserved. I recommend this game if you enjoy war like games that don't require you to have a keyboard for help with the controls or want to see blood and guts!	1
Released on September 29, 1996, it seems like only yesterday I was spending countless amount of hours at my brother's house playing&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Goldeneye/dp/B00000DMAT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Goldeneye</a>,<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/WWF-War-Zone/dp/B000034DEB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">WWF War Zone</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Killer-Instinct/dp/B00002SVFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Killer Instinct</a>. Being the only 3 games we owned at the time, we played them until our fingers almost had blisters. Of course I was a PS1 fan boy at the time and wasn't able to fully enjoy other titles until I got much older and was able to purchase the N64 and other titles with my own money.  The only quarrel I have with the N64 is Nintendo coming to the conclusion that it should go cart based instead of disc. Carts couldn't hold as much information as the disc based PS1, so often cut-scenes or intro videos were cut out to save room. Not a complete deal breaker but not the smartest move. This also equaled games being highly compressed and looking blurry or washed out. Nintendo has always been a step behind the pack, but I believe had they chosen to go the disc route they may have won that gens console war.  Still a great console for its time and tons of great multiplayer titles and of course the Mario & Zelda games. Would be an awesome first console for younger kids. It's still cheap and most games can be had from $5-40.	1
great	1
works better than I imagine	1
Very good condition	1
Love playing 4 player smash. We need more controllers though as we always tend to overuse them in a month or so.	1
The N64 works great and is fantastic overall! I'd recommend this buyer again.	1
awsome thnx	1
Works perfect	1
From the makers of the acclaimed SimCity comes SimTower.  This game, although from an impressive company with a good reputation, doesn't live up to it's good name as well as it should.  The view for the majority of the  game is the same, just getting bigger, it's a cut-a-way of a hotel.  The  game is simple, build a 5-star hotel, but the work to get it there is far  from simple.  This game is challenging, time taking, somewhat addictive  game.  You build apartments in your building if you want a constant source  of profit.  Condos are built if you want a one-time payment.  You build  theaters, escalators, resaurants, offices, and more in this game.  As your  rating increases(2 star to 3 star...) so does the amount of items you have  the ability to insert.  The reason I gave this a four star instead of five  is just beacuse I didn't find it incredibly addictive.  It couldn't hold my  attention long enough.  Most of the time is spent waiting for your money to  accumulate so that you can purchase new features.  All-in-all I would  reccommend this game, even with its downsides, just because it is a fun and  simple game to learn and play.  I think I might go play it right now.	1
It is really a shame that this game was never updated for windows XP. You can run most of the features, but the practice shooting range no longer works and this is an important feature. You need to practice to do well in solving the puzzles. I wrote to them a while back but they showed no interest in providing a fix. I guess they made their money and don't care.	-1
There are two things to think about when talking about this game. One is the game mechanics themselves and one is the execution of the look and feel of the game. On the former the game lacks, but as far as the way the game looks and sounds you will be hard pressed to find a computer game that puts you this deeply into a franchise. Blade Runner is this kind of game.  Westwood Studios decided to take a stab at the Blade Runner franchise and make a game so true to the movie that you would be hard pressed to tell the difference. I think they succeeded in this. They do it in three ways: Plot or story structure, visuals and sound. All of which holds onto an important credo: be true to the source material.  The plot itself puts you in the Blade Runner world as a Rep Detec (a Blade Runner) on the hunt for a group fugitive replicants. Apparently this is all happening at the exact same time as the movie events as well (kinda like two different cases going on in the department). The mood and manner of the story is well done and they brought in a wealth of talent to do with voice acting, including a few from the original movie (Sean Young, Brion James, William Sanderson and more). Add some really nice cut scenes and you get a pretty theatrical experience. One "scene" where you walk out of your apartment balcony so see the city streets and skyline is almost worth playing the game alone.  The visuals are stunning for when the game was made. Actually they still are. The backgrounds are pre-rendered with some interaction here and there. While that sounds like it makes a rather static game it does mean when you walk into a familar Blade Runner movie location you REALLY feel it. Down to the little details the background visuals really inspire.  While the visuals are great I think what really makes the difference in this game is the sound. I think this game takes full advantage of having 32 channels of audio, and if it doesn't it sure does sound like it. Every location you go to is filled with environmental sounds. This more than anything else sucks you into the setting. Add to that the occasional cues from the Vangelis soundtrack (which mixes in perfectly by the way), PLUS the incredible voice acting, and the audio experience in breathtaking. Even with two speakers it's incredible. Add some surround sound and you will get lost in the game.  Okay that's all the good stuff about the game, but I did say the actual game play was merely average. I meant that. The game is incredibly static. While you can travel all over the place and see the beautiful sites and sounds (which is a good thing if you think about it) the game will not progress until you take a specific action or interview a specific person. You play a detective in the game, but since the game is so linear you really don't get a chance to stretch your detecting skills much.  Also while the backgrounds and static images or animations are incredible Westwood made a compromise and decided to reduce the resolution of the items that are more dynamic so more people with "average" systems at the time could enjoy the game. The end result is you are a very pixelated character and the characters you interact with are just as pixellated. While shading is not too bad on your pixelled self any time you compare with the backgrounds the difference is painfully obvious.  So the game had pixelled characters and VERY linear gameplay. That's not the reason to get it. The reason to buy Blade Runner is to get yourself immersed in the Blade Runner universe. This, more than anything else, is what the accomplishes in spades.	1
I'm a huge Blade Runner fan, first and for most.  When I bought The game, I was astonished.  The plot beautifully done.  You play BR dectective Ray McCoy (Sorry fans, but you can't play Rick Deckard in this.  But he does show up in a picture you recieve.  Plus, on the training maze, it shows his top score).  You're first assignment for the day is an animal murder of a fancy pet shop (in the future, animals are very rare, so they made bad fake ones).  Once getting your hands on a picture of several replicants, the perps that Blade Runners chase, the real story begins. What also makes this game really neat is how you chose the ending, and your fate; you can be a replicant killer and kill all the replicants in the story, or you can be a replicant helper and help the replicants escape.  The music is straight from the film, even though Vangelis didn't do the job.  Most of the stars from the film, (Sean Young, Joe Turkel, William Sanderson, ect.) return to their charecters' voices, exept for Ruger Hauer, Harrison Ford and Daryl Hannah.  Some people think that Gaff in the game (yes, he is)  is played by, none other, than Edward James Olmos; this is false.  EJO is way to great of an actor to be played in a video game.  Most of the charecters in the game replicate the ones in the movie, (for example, Ray is supposed to be Deckard, Roy Baty is replaced by a rep. named Clovis and Cap. Bryant is replaced by a fat, sleazebag named Guzza).  Even one of the endings, in which Ray drives off with a girl replicant, is a copy of the original ending for the movie!  This game is the best.  You'll like it even if your not a BR fan.  Enjoy!	1
I picked this game up about a year ago, having never seen the movie. I did not know what to expect. What I got though, was a completely thought provoking, psychologicially challenging, intuitive, breathtaking and mezmorizing game that left me clutched to my computer for days. The story is unlike any other. It follows the locations of the movie, and if you have seen it, you'll recognize many of the scenes. Cut scenes in games usually are a let down; here, they excell. The gameplay never dips, unless you get stuck and are pulling your hair out trying to figure out what to do next. But that is how murder mysteries are supposed to be. This isn't a game that you will finish in 3 hours. Heck, when I play it over, it still takes me awhile. The main drawing point to this game is the numerous paths that you can take. It is an adventure game in REAL time. So if you are lolly-gagging around in one area for a long time just doing nothing, you'll miss something later and the game will change. You can ALWAYS beat the game, but the path you take is what makes the game so outstanding. Are you a good guy? A Bad guy? Who are you? It all depends on the decisions that you make and the people/replicants that you enteract with. If you are a hardcore adventure gamer and don't have this one, you should be ashamed. As for everyone else, you are without excuse as well. Buy it now.	1
This game version of the popular sci-fi movie is excellent.  The graphics, music and gameplay are first rate.  As an added bonus, you can replay the game many times, as the endings vary. For fans of the film, this is a must buy.  For adventure gamers it is a game you will keep and play again and again.	1
This game sets itself apart from other games in the adventure genre, mainly due to the fact that it is so realistic.  Gameplay is anything but linear and the sound of the character voices and environments is great.  Good cut scenes as well.  Most importantly, the game has multiple endings, so replay value is high.  Don't miss out on this classic, which does the movie and the book proud.	1
Taking place at the same time as the movie, this game immerses you in an  amazing cyberpunk world, filled with odd characters.  The settings are  stunning, the music haunting, and the gameplay rarely disappoints.   Though the game boasts a "real time" world, most events wait for  you to do something before occurring (bombs won't blow up until you get  there, etc).  But there are times when you have to do something quickly, or  you'll lose your chance to do it (chasing and catching someone so you can  pursue a dialogue tree).  At times also the puzzles and gameplay were a  little simplistic--but the story always carried it on, in my opinion.  You  /wanted/ to know what would happen next, even if you had to do some silly  tasks to find out what.  As for content: a little violence (you're a cop,  after all), a little bit of scantily clad female CGI flesh, and a bit of  swearing--nothing over the top.  Play it even if you haven't seen the  movie--you'll probably want to after you finish the game, though.	1
Blade Runner is a game by Westwood Studio's, the great people who brought you Command & Conquer and a studio always breaking new grounds in  technology.  This game was great, becasue a number of reasons.  One,  because you don't even have to like the movie to play this game, nor do you  have to see it to play the game.  Second, it really has many effects that  really put you in the world of this cop/detective.  Third, the cinema  scenes are awesome and run smoothly even on older systems and really add  quite a movie-esque feel to this.  But that's not all, it has 6 different  endings, depending on who you talk to or what you do during the game.  It's  really ashame to see such a great game with cutting edge technology on it's  background and nobody really knew of this game.  It's like a Zelda game  comming out, but not noticed.  Even if you didn't know about this epic  game, you shouldn't doubt it's style, because it has everything you could  want in a game.  The soundtrack is awesome, the graphics (even though the  characters are a bit pixilized)are awesome, and the replay value is over  the hill.  I've played this game over 8 times and still havn't seen all the  endings.  With the cheap price they're asking, why not give it a try, you  won't be sorry.	1
Blade Runner is very appealing to me.  I have played the game through at least thirty times.  One thing I love about the game is the sound of rain falling down. The voice acting is very impressive, and the game has a great  script. I actully found the plot of the game more appealing than that of  the movies. A few downsides I can get over is the video sequences.  A  lot of them have really bad animation.  Another downside is the audio,  sometimes when two characters are talking to each other there will be a  long pause in-between the end of one person's dialogue and the start of the  next person's.  Like I said I can get over that.	1
Everything is okay.	1
This is great gaming at its core. Its simplicity and all-around great design is great on the eyes. The games that it holds are some of the best that have ever been created. Controller is comfortable and easy to get used to. (And it's incredibly unique) What I noticed right away and actually frogot about as a kid is that when you press power, the game starts right up. There are no menus on the console. It's not an entertainment system; it's a gaming console exclusively. If you like quick start-ups, no loading screens, and pretty graphics, then pick one of these up. They're classic and hard to find for a good price. And the games are also hard to find for good prices, too. Definitely worth some money, though because this is the pinnacle of gaming systems.	1
SimAnt is an excellent simulation of ant battle, but is easy to beat and the sound and graphic quality is poor.  Basically, you're an ant in a colony trying to destroy the red ants.  A spider (which somehow shoots lasers occasionally, don't ask me) and ant lions are among the existing perils.  It's pretty involved, with mating, behavior control, and foraging.  These can be left alone (except the first), but it can be tougher without them.  The full-game mode, the only one that I find worthwile, is too easy to beat and involves a simple strategy.  I recommend this primarily for people who like strategy games.	1
This seller named woodhec sent me a DEFECTIVE N64 Console and I was very disappointed for Christmas! Don't ever buy from this seller unless you want to get robbed of your money. This deserves a FLAT 0!	-1
This is the game that got me hooked on computer games.  You are an ant.  Well not just one ant, a whole nest of them.  You can be any ant you want and you can control them all if you want or let them do their own thing.  I was that type of kid that liked to play in the ant bed and feed spiders crickets I caught in the grass.  This game lets you do that in the summer/winter/spring/fall/summer/winter...	1
I am very impressed with the condition it arrived in! It was in almost perfect shape aside from a few scruff marks, and it looks almost brand new,  Even though I knew it came with no controllers, I still was a little disappointed, but hey, I got one arriving in a few days anyway, so no problem.  The one thing that did bother me was that when I read the description, it said the console I ordered was RED, is not an issue, just was a pleasant surprise.  Anyways, I also bought perfect dark, and plan to buy even more N64 games, and I can't wait to play them!  Thanks dutchmoney10!!!	1
Great condition! Works as expected. All productivity has now been lost to Mario Kart.	1
As shown, works fine	1
Thanks for being honest. It was perfect. Thanks again, everything was as describe.	1
This system really surprised me. I didn't think I would like this console. The controller looked like it required 3 hands, and people seem to hate this thing. So I assumed I wouldn't like it. Then I got it as gift from a friend. (Well it's technically my sisters). Then I started to play it's library of games and realized the old me foolish to ever assume that a controller or bad reputation could define a console. Here are a few reasons why this thing should be on your shelf today!  1. The Games. Like (almost)any Nintendo console the games drive it home. To name a few. Mario 64, Ocarina of Time, Majoras Mask, Pokemon Stadium, F-zeroX, Mario Tennis, Donkey Kong 64, Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, Kirby and the Krystal Shards, Banjo and Kazooie, Conker's Bad Fur Day, and Paper Mario. Not enough? You want more? OK! Smash Bros., Star Fox 64,  Rayman 2, Pilot Wings 64, Mario Kart 64, Yoshi's Story, and last but not least Harvest Moon. Name another console with that many good games. OK you can name a few but holy %$^# that's one fine library.  2. Four controller ports and a console that USES ALL OF THEM. What's more fun than player single player? Playing multiplayer. The finest form of that is playing multiplayer in a four way spectacular. Invite three friends over and  have a ball.  3. 3-D. This is the first Nintendo 3-D console. It's the first of it's kind so it isn't amazing. Just Noteworthy.  Here are the Technical specs via Wikepedia,  CPU: 64-bit NEC VR4300 (MIPS R4300i) with 24KB L1 cache, running at 93.75 MHz CPU performance: 125 MIPS (million instructions per second) "Reality Coprocessor" 64-bit chip running at 62.5 MHz. This microcode-reprogrammable chip is composed of two integrated processors: the Reality Signal Processor (RSP) which handles 3D control and sound, and the Reality Display Processor (RDP) which handles pixel drawing operations. GPU performance: 500 MIPS and 100 MFLOPS. Bilinear and trilinear mip map filtering, perspective-correct texture mapping, edge anti-aliasing, 9-Bit Z-buffering, environment mapping, Gouraud shading, 24-bit maximum color depth with 8-bit transparency, 15-bit onscreen Memory: 4 MB RDRAM (Rambus DRAM) on a 9-bit 562.5 MB/s bus, upgradable to 8MB with Expansion Pak ROM cartridge bus running at 264 MB/s Resolution: 240p (320240), 288p (384288), 480i (640480), 576i (720576), widescreen via letterboxing and anamorphic compression Color palette: 16,777,216 (24-bit color depth) Colors on screen: 207,360 (720288)  Buy if,  You like older vintage games,  Can appreciate a great library,  Have fun.  Don't Buy if,  You don't have three hands(Joking of course),  Hate Nintendo,  Cant play older games.	1
My N64 didn't come with very much. I paid $60, and it came with the wires and Perfect Dark, but I had two major issues. One, it didn't come with a Jumper Pak or Expansion Pak, which meant I had to go and buy one separately, and on the controller that came with it, the left C button didn't work. It may not seem important, but not being able to use an item slot or move the camera in a certain direction isn't very fun.	-1
Love it to death. I can see so much fun in my future with this bad boy	1
Awesome	1
Buy this game and see why Computer Gaming World ranked it as the best RPG of 1999.  Be warned, it's extremely text-heavy, so plan on lots of reading!  But don't let that deture you from a GREAT computer story with well drawn  out and interesting characters and quests.	1
Well, if you haven't figured it out yet from the other reviews, the player assumes the role of an immortal searching for his identity. So the game exhibits a dark shadow of death and rebirth. This fact kind of hits home with me.  A little over a year ago, I was in a crippling auto accident (broke my neck/spinal injury) where I could have easily been killed.  So the game's theme is a bit creepy to me at times and gets me thinking that I'm not afraid of dying. But on to game play...with the ability to play your character the way you want (good or evil) and to answer dialogue questions with truths, lies, or playing dumb, Torment will play different every time.  Also in Character generation, Want to be a fighter?  Gear up on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.  Want to be a Mage, Gear up on Intelligence, Wisdom. I especially love the verbal taunts after a 'critical' hit or misses...like "DIE!", "Did you see that?" and "Damn" The special effects are cool too. Spells, healing animations, critical hits and such. The story line is complex and drawingly addictive.  It's nothing to spend a half a day to play thru a relatively small portion of the game with its numerous quests-which provide you more 'experience' than the hacking coming out shortly.  We'll have to wait and see.	1
For the last couple of years people have been patiently awaiting the release of  I found out that the same makers of those two great games where releasing an RPG in my favorite campaign setting, I almost soiled myself with glee. Torment uses the Baldur's engine, but don't be the setting is not the sword and sorcery genre you are used too.  In fact to me, it seems to have more of the quirkiness of Fallout2 than the straitforward D&D elements of Baldur's.  There are few weapons choices and I've never even worn any armor, but, you won't miss any of that. The main PC is a recently resurrented immortal and his first ally is a floating skull.  I have almost finished the game and my weapon of choice through most of it was my own severed arm!  How can you not love that? The only reason I'm not giving the game 5 stars is because, for my system, I found it quite buggy.  I suffered lots of lockups and assertion errors, as well as the occasional graphics glitch.  The third disk had trouble loading at times as well. I still highly recommend this game, and I commend Black Isle for putting the RP back into RPG.  The setting and story are compelling and unpredictable and the party members are rich and interesting instead of just someone to hold your treasure.  So, if you are biting your nails in anticipation for Diablo 2, give Torment a try (and if you haven't already, try Baldur's and Fallout2) you will be glad you did.	1
as expected	1
Love this game...	1
The greatest WRPG made	1
Its perfect seriously there aren't any scratches. Thanks	1
Good	1
A+++	1
This is still widely considered an A+ game as a unique, creative, thoughtful, story-driven open rpg. This is not a battle-driven game like baldur's gate, but there is melee and magic... But the dialogue is great, good characters, the story is deep, it will make you laugh and think and feel sad... It is a grim but extremely creative world. Lot of detail. Interesting complex world (competing factions, moral choices, different planes of existence, towns, etc.) Very immersive game. Read the gaming reviews, besides the user reviews here. AND know there is a great set of mods by the programming fan community to make this modern resolutions scaled for current screens. Also fixes a number of bugs & adds other options. Just Google "planescape torment mods". Thunderpeel2001's page explains it best. Oh yeah, this is an isometric (top down) RPG... But the view is somewhat closer to the ground and angled a bit so the details and characters are easier to see than in most isometric rpg's.	1
the game is great but youll be dissappointed in what you get. they said Planescape: Torment - PC Complete w/Big Box & Manual....thats  a big nope. no manual no big box just the standard dvd case and i doubt the dvd was new.	1
Another great game. This one installs fine under Win 7 32-bit. I had no problems getting it to install. It also runs OK to. I had to adjust the resolutions a bit to fine the one that worked best with my monitor graphic card set up but this was no problem and was easily taken care of. Although a standard RPG game, this one has a bit of an attitude on it, but this only makes the game more fun. I found it sort of fun to "set up" a character that really looks as if he's been drug through a pit full of razor blades to start the game with. At first, I thought that I had made a mistake somewhere while setting up the game and then it dawned on me this was how he was suppose to look. I started laughing as this was a lot of fun. Overall a very good game.	1
This game is so boring, I never finished it. For one, you can't die, you just resurrect, so why even care if you get killed. Also, you can get lost and never finish a mission and not care because even if you do, nothing happens. You don't build up armor or weapons and who cares any ways because, oh right, you can't die. You also can't build up a hunting party and people you meet have no real purpose because you can go anywhere. I never figured out the importance of any of the story line.	-1
I have always loved this system! Phenomenal quality!	1
fantastic till the controllers went south.	1
great price	1
Works great, arrived on time, and packaged well. Good job!	1
I'm giving 1 star because this is one of the cheapest packages I have ever bought, it looks like a pirated copy! No, wait, a pirated copy would look better!! All the disks came in a single case, onve over the other (which caused scratches in almost all of them), Oh and all the cool covers on the disks? horrible black and white labels! I regret buying this!	-1
*****This disclaimer is for the company who sold the PC game thru Amazon. Its listed as "Complete w/Big Box & Manual". It arrived as a regular PC/DVD Rom movie box plastic case (not a "big" game box), and NO manual inside the "case"! You might as well order the game in jewelcase version and save the money,rather buy from this one. Amazon I hope you somehow force this company GAMEWIZARD to change its listing.  ******Black Isle Studio's games are some of the BEST RPG's ever made. You can't go wrong with this game! " Welcome to Sigil, the "City of Doors", a place with gates that lead anywhere in existence, provided you have the proper key. It is a neutral ground and watering hole for races across the multiverse, all under the watchful shadow of the Lady of Pain, the enigmatic ruler of the city. It is a place where the word is mightier than the sword, where thought defines reality, where belief has the power to reshape worlds and change the laws of physics." -Interplay  A true RPG classic in its own right.	1
This was not in a big box with a manual as advertised.  Hence the four stars and not five.  The game itself is extremely addictive for those that love playing the D&D games.  Very creative and thoughtful writing.	1
Game came out in 1999. It has, by far, the very best WRITING of any computer game. At one point in the game, the writers use Milton's "Paradise Lost" to advance the plot. The big surprise is that it works on a Windows 8 computer! Sure, there are Graphics issues, especially with Spell effects; but, for Heaven's sakes, buy this game! You will be moved....	1
Why does this game still end up getting reviews years later?  Why is it considered a must play, and retains that status years later?  Because this game is an all time classic, an amazing experience that has yet to be matched.  This is an amazing work of art.  The fact that it gets the recognition it deserves years later is a testament to it's utter brilliance.  It has an amazing storyline, and some of the most beautiful dialogue I've witnessed, amazing characters, and much more.  Be careful.  It may just change you in various ways.  It's a terrific work, and will stay with you forever.  Get it now!	1
I agree with so many fellow gamers that this is easily one of the best games to have been produced. Fantastic story, interesting characters and engaging dialogue. Unlike so many fantasy games this one is "not" built around destroying everything in sight. The most rewarding portions are solving the myteries about the main (your) character,  "The Nameless One." Fighting is necessary at times, but discovery is the name of this game.	1
Awesome	1
I Have enjoyed this game emmissially. Didn't recieve any manual or big box,but no biggy. shall continue to play anyway. Thanks	1
this game gets a lot of great reviews, and i guess almost ten years ago, this game was considered cutting edge with RPGs for PCs. i only bought this game two months ago, and i feel it's only okay. the graphics are a bit bland, which creates problems because sometimes your character will have to find something in the game environment but since so much on the screen is either shadowed or looks the same, it's hard to spot important things. also, the AI can be maddeningly frustrating. you "control" a group of about five players, but they'll do the most ridiculous things, like running into danger, standing and simply getting hit, not attacking. this becomes a serious issue towards the end of the game when you have to fight a lot and need your characters to be on point instead of doing things which specifically gets them hurt and killed. overall, this game is okay, the storyline is okay. it's just a blah sort of game.	-1
Planescape Torment is a cult classic and is considered by many to have the best story in any video game ever made.  I recently completed it, and I'm here to tell you that the hype is justified--this is an incredible game.  It instantly makes it into my all time top 5.  Planescape contains one of the most unique and interesting settings and the best writing and plot I have ever seen in a video game.  It's possible there are some adventure games that can hold a candle to it (I've heard the story in the game The Longest Journey is mind blowing), but I haven't played them.   In terms of gameplay, this game is similar to the Baldur's Gate series, although it does have a few enhancements to the engine such as the ability to queue up multiple actions.  The combat here is not quite as tight as found in Baldur's Gate, but it gets the job done just fine.  This game is more focused on dialogue than combat, so if you like a very combat heavy game then you might not like it quite as much.  That said, it's pretty hard to imagine anyone who enjoys video games and a good story not enjoying this game.  You should also not get the idea that this is just a point and click adventure game with no real combat.  There is still plenty of combat, and you must do some heavy fighting to get through a number of sequences in the game.  Although there isn't a ton of it, the voice acting is another major strong point in this game that I wanted to mention.  Another thing I like is that you level up A LOT in this game.  You start out as sort of weak, but by the end of the game you are a bad, bad man, and that's something I always like in my RPGs.   Graphically, this game looks pretty ragged on a widescreen computer at its original resolution, but this doesn't matter because there is an easy to use mod that allows you to play it in widescreen.  Using the mod, it looks fantastic in widescreen.  The artwork for the levels is quite detailed and lovely--it made me long for the days of 2d graphics to be honest.  I found full on widescreen at 1280 x 800 to be too zoomed out, so I made a custom resolution for 960 x 600 and found that to be just about right.  In fact, there are a number of good mods that people generally recommend you get for the game which you can find using google.  Most of these simply fix bugs and things of that nature rather than adding entirely new material.   A gameplay tip I would like to mention is that most people say that to get the full experience you have to put a lot of stat points in intelligence and wisdom because this opens up more dialogue options and story elements.  I am not sure how much is necessary to get everything, but just thought I'd pass that along.  I created a mage and had them both very, very high.	1
I received my first console in 1977 and my last in 2010 and of all the Nintendo 64 was my favorite. It didn't have the vast library the Ps1 had but it did have outstanding games like Super Mario 64, Mario kart 64, Zelda Ocarina of Time, Majoras Mask, Goldeneye 007, Banjo Kazooie and others that could only be played on the N64 plus it had 4 person multiplayer built in. It was an incredible console for its time. Even its cartridge limitations were overcome when they were able to fit all of Resident Evil 2 on a single cartridge. Though I have little time now to devote to gaming I do sometimes get nostalgic and pop in SM64, Goldeneye or some other N64 game and relive those great experiences.  My N64 happens to be the only pre 2000 console I kept. The rest I sold off or tossed. I hate to think how gaming would have turned out without its contribution.	1
Works Great!	1
A classic system	1
This N64 console was released in September 1996. There were 44 games that ended with 64. The last N64 game ever released was "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3".	1
After so many years of reading books, playing video games & watching movies, certain stereotypes tend to get really worn out, the "save the world" and "amnesiac hero" cliches and the Tolkien based fantasy realms of RPGs started to become boring after awhile. There were always some magnificent exceptions like Darklands, System Shock, Wasteland (and it's direct descendants; the Fallouts) but all in all by the late nineties I had begun to drift more toward Console RPGs; their design was pretty formulaic but at least they took some chances with their setting and stories. But then I played Planescape Torment Some of the usually criticisms towards CRPGs is how they are all combatcentric and how they lack of real "choice" in how the game unfolds, you had to go to Darklands to find the last game that really offered you alternatives between fighting a monster, tricking him and sneaking away or talking him out of bashing your skull. Planescape Torment had this and much more. Not since the days of the Quest for Glory series had a game like this tailored the experience more to your character, plus you could be as kind hearted or ruthless as you wanted, this game had no restrictions on what kind of choices you could make, and literaly having a "blank slate" hero that had an actual history before begining the game was such a powerful experience that even today its unmatched. I mentioned Quest for Glory because you could amost play Torment as an adventure game where you don't have to worry so much about the next big fight, but how the next development of the story was going to affect you. The rich and thought provoking dialogues (imagine that in kiddie friendly modern games!) of the Nameless One and the denizens of the Planes you visited during the journey were so powerful that even today they are unmatched in their creativity and ingenuity (can anyone forget the Brothel of Slating Intellectual Lusts, or the confrontation with Ravel?) In the end, how many games can you honestly name that actually made you sad to finish because that meant that the experience was over? The unfolding story of The Nameless One and his quest to find himself is still one of my favorite games of all time in ANY genre.	1
I bought this game for my brother and he said it is an awsome game. The graghics are cool. The gameplay is challenging.	1
I've been playing video games for about 18 years or so. I started on consoles (SNES, N64, etc.), but I eventually moved into PC gaming. The main reasons I switched are Fallout, Baldur's Gate, and Planescape freaking Torment.  Torment is by far the best game I have ever played. To describe it properly, however, is impossible. It's a game that's almost like a book. There is a lot of text. There are only three required fights in the entire game, if I recall correctly. But I'll be damned if I've never enjoyed reading and playing a video game more than I did with Torment. All of the characters have well-developed backstories that you get to see piece by piece as the game goes on. There is plenty of lore for people who love knowing about the world they're playing in (you get an illustration and a nice description of EVERY SINGLE UNIT you encounter in the game). The towns in the game are ALIVE. The sounds make you really feel like the NPCs in the game are actually doing things other than standing around and moving occasionally. The environments are detailed and done extremely well -- every zone is unique. You don't feel like you're in the same place ever.  But it's the story... the STORY of Torment is truly literature in my eyes. You find out that the "hero" you play has been around for ages, and was actually kind of a jerk to a lot of people you'll meet. It's an amnesia story, so slightly unoriginal in that respect, but it's still VERY VERY original and sad and clever. This game is one of the few games where I felt really bad for one of my party members because the description of the memory you have of how you treated him is just brutal. If it was a movie, the scene would be all of 5 seconds long (and really not graphic), but Black Isle Studios' writers were masters at what they did. And they evoke so many emotions in this game through their writing and descriptions.  Please please please play this game. Pirate it if you have to, because Black Isle Studios is no longer around, so the people responsible for the game won't get rewarded financially. But they, you, and the video gamers in general will be rewarded if you just play this game. Once you play the game and get through it, you will finally realize how much better games can be. We can prevent Halo 16, Call of Duty 5 part Modern Warfare 2, or Super Mario XXIXIIVIXX from being all that is expected out of a game. If we demand that video game makers create high-quality, progressive products like Torment or Fallout (not that atrocious abomination that Bethesda pinched out), then video games might be taken more seriously. Torment is art. It's literature. Roger Ebert has no idea what he's talking about, or he's never seen a game as phenomenal as this one.  Get it and do yourself a favor.	1
I played this for a long, long time way back on the original version I purchased when it came out.  I don't know what became of that original copy, but I was overjoyed to find this republished here on amazon.com.  There are places in this game that stick in my memory - the dead city buried under Ragpicker's Square, Curst, and the Fortress of Regrets.  The wonderful city of Sigil that seemed to possess so many dark corners and odd inhabitants from all corners of the multiverse.  There was something vastly different about this game, something that set it apart from the wonderful BGII and other games of the day.  There is even something that sets it apart from the games of today, such as Dragon Age and Oblivion.  Granted, the graphics are aged, but still catch the eye.  They possess an art style that still makes them intriguing.  The depth of ideas, philosophy and wonderful fictional history floating within the text conversations that frequent the game is what sets it above most of the RPGs of years gone and even the ones of today.  Upon playing it again, I am enjoying it immensely, but find myself in a way rather sad.  This game was a pinnacle from back in the day, back when you spent hours delving into conversations and puzzles trying to find the next step to solve the riddle of a man, your immortal protagonist that ever struggles to find his scattered memories.  However most of what is produced today doesn't seem to come close.  I found I greatly enjoyed Fallout 3, a wonderful example of depth with improved graphics.  But discouraged with the linear fare typical with many console/PC games, such as Dragon Age, Mass Effect, and the latest FF offerings.  It would be absolutely killer if someone revisited Planescape with something akin to Fallout 3.  Alas, it will probably never happen.  If you like RPGs however, I highly recommend you snag a copy of this gem while it is still available.  One of the finest examples of the genre out there.	1
Over a decade old, still one of the best games I've ever played, *and* one of the top 3 stories I've ever read. That's right: read. The game's vivid, engrossing writing draws you in the way games with full voice acting often fail to do, and leaves an enduring impression on you.  I really can't add much more to what's already been said, but like a former reviewer stated, one might ask oneself how an old and admittedly graphically dated game is still getting 5-star reviews. I take it it's the formula of a superbly fleshed-out world, memorable characters, engaging voice acting, a twisting and turning plot, and rich visuals.  With a wardrobe full of style and more substance than you can shake an Entropic Blade at, Planescape: Torment is a classic that transcends the borders of gameplay and becomes a masterclass in storytelling.	1
If poetry found its way into videogames, the result would be Planescape: Torment, the game with as much text as an encyclopedia... er, maybe that's not the best turn-on to this game.  There are a lot of reviews that would give away a few of the best moments to convey just how spectacular this game is, but I don't think even those spoilers could fill you in on how amazing this game is.  If I had to put it succinctly, other forms of media such as movies and books and music have had the capacity to change lives for years; this is, in my opinion, the first game that has that power.  It's interesting that this isn't a game about combat; talking through situations will usually net you more experience than killing people left and right.  As an experience it is perfect from beginning to end, and even a decade later, and with Black Isle Studios closed, it is the only game of its type that I have ever experienced.  Yes, it's old and the graphics are showing their wrinkles; the pathfinding will make you sigh in annoyance; there will be some crashes; it will need some patching; but this game is worth it and more.  I don't know if this sort of appeal works with gamers who are more interested in wiping out Nazis than experiencing a game that contains one of the greatest stories ever told, but it has great appeal to those who are ready to discover something astounding.  This is poetry.	1
For some reason, back when this came out I had no warning.  All of a sudden it appeared at the Video Game store.  I must say that I typically enjoy the products Black Isle puts out and I got quite excited when I saw they had released something in the Planescape setting.  I'm probably one of the few die-hard Planescape fans out there.  I own all the AD&D books and supplements, as well as the Collectible Card Game. Also, my friends and I are slowly working through playing them all!  Anyway, as for games, my favorite genres are First Person Shooters and Role Playing Games.  Once and I while I'll find a good game outside of those genres, but those typically stay my favorite, though there are naturally some flops as well.  I am pleased to say that Planescape: Torment is not the latter.  In fact this, even after these near ten years since it's release, remains as one of the top RPG's I've ever played, but that could just be my Planescape bias speaking.  For those of us out there who have gotten into playing D&D 3.5 probably won't recognize what Thaco is for, but you have to remember this is based on the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons rules.  Regardless, it still doesn't really take away from the game play, if you're a fan of the new rules.  As far as this compares against other RPG's, I was shocked that it comes with a pre-made character.  Now you do have to choose the class, so you have options in that right.  At first I was a little skeptical, but as you go into the story-line you get really into it.  The story-line is what really makes the game.  Basically you don't know who you are and you interact with a world that you have to essentially rediscover because you have some sort of strange amnesia.  You awaken in the mortuary of Sigil, because the Dustmen thought you were dead.  In Planescape Sigil is basically the fulcrum city for access to everywhere else.  You get to visit many other planes in this multiverse setting and graphically it's all very impressive.  I thought this game really captured the essence and majesty that is the Planescape setting and they really put it together down to the very last detail.  I imagine this was immensly difficult considering how large this setting actually is.  Naturally it doesn't have EVERYTHING, but it captures the major points at the very least.  You come across other characters through your adventures that decide to join you in your path as well and you eventually grow a pretty strong party to face the higher levels.  So the game is partially a mystery, but there is a lot of action sequences where your character can choose to fight his way through.  In this the script is also very well written, which was something else that really impressed me about this game.  This is one of the closest games I've come across that's very similar to a true D&D campaign.  The negatives that some users might walk away with is that it really is only a single player game, so you can't join forces over the net like you can in games like Diablo.  Also you're limited to being the Nameless One and once his story line is over, it's pretty much done.  However, the ability to play in different classes throughout the game sort of makes up for this factor.  It was honestly a small negative for me because I tend to play through games only once then start a new and totally different game.  There are only a few games that I will play multiple times over and over.  In the end this is an absolutely enthralling story.  I logged a lot of hours playing this game and it easily kept me occupied for a few months.  I don't play games all day for long periods of time, rather I tend to play for a few hours each day, so it takes me a long time to complete epic games of this magnitude.  If you are a die-hard Planescape fan, like me, then this is absolutely a must buy and if you're also quite the connoisseur of RPG's, then this is definitely a game to look into.	1
How to write review without spoiling a game, having so great plot? Let's just say this game has better plot than most of novels in genre. It will make you laugh, cry, and even feel scared sometimes.  Game begins in thrash horror-hellraiserish environment but I wouldn't call it a horror RPG. Sure, there are scary elements but there are also extremely humorous parts, although game is more serious than Arcanum,which is prank-based. Story has both phylosophical and absurd humour aspect, since in all games you have limited life points and here, you are immortal trying to fid out about himself.  Characters are incredible: an anarchist who has to be loyal to main character, succubus who has bordel for INTELECTUAL lust, a floating skull who always gives ladies overgenerous comments and so on. Each of them is so impressive that communicating resembles talking to people you know from somewhere.  Unlike many games, dialogue solves most of quests and Intelligence and Wisdom are much more appreciated here than in other RPGs. Fighting is intensive only at the end of game, so story is everything.  Graphics look nice even today, after 12 years. The architecture and artwork are stylish and will never be outdated.  Pick this up, it is maybe even better that Fallout (original sequels, not Betheseda's Fallout 3) and deeper than Arcanuum.  EDIT After slowly metabolising impressions about this game, I found out it is a story with a moral, or let's say short phylosophycal tale. If you want to play one RPG on PC, I am sure this is the one you need to play.	1
I still am mad at my dad for selling my N64 back in 2002 to a guy in germany, but they're the cheapest game console I can think of today that is still graphically holds up.  game selection 7/10, 386 games is nowhere near colse as the PS1, but alot of 3D games that you loved on the SNES come on here! mario, zelda, FZero, Metroid, DOOM 64 are all on here!  Controller 6/10 IDK wat nintendo was thinking with this, alot of game controls need alot of getting used to, like 2 D-pads & a analog stick? do ya think thats enough?! and its not the most conftorable thing to hold, and the rumble paks do make it significantly heavier then say saturn or PS1 controllers, but it does make 3D games more natural to control  i really don't get Y they went with cartridges, I mean I love them, but audio & video is almost completely non existant on here, music loops kinda short, the cutscenes are used with polygons instead of CG, but load times are only 2 seconds!  now getting one today is easy, since alot of games were made for it, and they won't break, but it kinda feels olde then it looks, always get one with a memory expansion pak! the jumper pak gives the framerate slower then it should	1
I would have liked the inclusion of an Audio-video cable and a controller, but those add-ons typically run extra, so I wasn't surprised they weren't included.	1
OH MY OH ME The Nintendo 64 Game Full Pack I used have one a long time ago but I have a new Nintendo 64 Game System Along with the other games.	1
I loved this game!  I played it about 4 years ago. Black Isle strikes again  with a fantastic game ...  You can only play one character (the nameless one) but he is  super cool. He NEVER dies! lol ... well he can but then he gets back up again and ready to fight again. So, you can't actually get killed for good in this game.  You can join up with several NPC's, one being a floating skull  named, Morte. He is very cool to have around and is very powerful in high levels. There is even a somewhat romance for  the main character ... she's got a tail (laughs) and she is very neat to have around.  The graphics are superb, the storyline is one of the best I've seen and the combat system I just loved. Very easy to use controls and has dungeon crawl galore.  It's been awhile since I actually played it, but if I remember right, you can play 3 different classes. A fighter, a thief or a mage. The fighter class is by far the best one to go with.  You basically start out in a dungeon, lying on a hospital table, and then are greeted by Morte who will help you get started with how the game works, your fighting, journal, etc. He will then join up with you and help you escape the place. There is much to do right from the beginning, trying to escape. I don't wanna give away too much, because it is a very awesome storyline.  I will add however, as the story unfolds your character finds out more about himself. Why is is there and what lies ahead for him. It's hard to explain, but I am sure you will love it.  Give it a try, you will not regret it.  Also has a nice modding community on sorcerers.net.  BUY AND PLAY THIS GAME!  Ciao.	1
Planescape: Torment is one of the best Role-Playing games ever written. The writing talent and imagination that went into the game are impressive, equalled by no other game I've played with the possible exception of the classic masterpiece Star Control 2. The Planescape universe is one of the most compelling and interesting I've seen, and the game's playable characters are all distinct, well-developed, sympathetic, and memorable. The game begins with the protagonist, the Nameless One, waking up on a cold stone slab in a mortuary, his memory gone and his body covered in scars and tattoos, his senses assaulted by the smell of formaldehyde and rotting flesh coming from the nearby corpses and the zombies that are working on them. This is a dark beginning, and the game remains dark throughout, which is unappealing to some and is probably responsible for this game's relatively poor sales compared to inferior but lighter games such as Baldur's Gate. (While Torment is a dark game, it does not require you to be evil or immoral--the darkness comes from the game's exploration of tragedy. One of its central questions is "what can change the nature of a man?" Its mood is similar, but not the same as, that of the Fallout games.) The equation is simple--if you're a lover of fiction who is not turned off by darkness, you will almost certainly love Planescape: Torment.	1
The console arrived in great condition. The packaging was done carefully and I haven't noticed any defects with the product. It works great and feels like new.	1
The people at Black Isle made this for people that want a lot of character developement and story in their RPG's.  Well, they succeeded with flying colors.  You wake up on a mortuary table with no memories.  As the game progresses, you explore Sigil (the city that joins the planes together)and recover your memories and realize that you have some sort of curse of immortality.  On your journey to stop the cycle of dying and coming back, you meet a large assortment of very interesting NPC's that will aid you on your quest.  All of which have pretty deep, well fleshed out personalities and sometimes keep the player entertained with amusing banter with one another.  The game also has a lot of replay value since your choices during conversation and actions you take when interacting with people you meet impact the future choices you'll have.  If you're mean, you'll get a reputation and it will precede you.  The way you assign your scores also makes a big impact.  The higher your wisdom, intelegence and charisma, the more dialogue you will have to choose from.  A higher wisdome and intelegence also grants you speedier recovery of your memories.  So, playing through as a strong fighter will be very different than playing through as a highly intelegent wizard or a smooth-talking rogue.  Ultimately, probably the best RPG I've ever played.	1
Planescape:  Torment is a great RPG, in the truest sense of the genre.  You play the Nameless One, a confused but apparently immortal (in the sense of if you die, you don't die for good) wanderer of the planes, whose very flesh tells the tale of his endless struggles.  You are turned loose into a world that bears only a passing and vague resemblance to any other D&D or RPG realm you may have encountered, and that is filled with endless mysteries and characters.  I've never played another game where you can spend an hour talking to the other NPCs in your party (let alone in the rest of the world), earning experience and knowledge for what you uncover about their lives, and never feel like you're bored.  There are plenty of fights but no sense of tedious hack-and-slash, and it's difficult to emphasize just how convoluted and intricate both the plot and the game systems really are.  As an example, at one point my Nameless character was festooned with power-granting tattoos, dual classed as a thief-mage, and clubbing his enemies with a severed limb from one of his own previous incarnations.  I mean, come on!  This is not really an RPG you can 'power game' your way through, more to its credit.  One of the most important statistics is Wisdom, tactics are more important than brute force, and the puzzles and side quests are to be savored, not accomplished as rapidly as possible.  Lastly, in response to some of the other reviews, I have to note a few things.  First, there are plenty of ranged weapons, particularly crossbows for a character you can obtain about halfway through in an impressive "side" quest.  Moreover, there are life indicators under the portrait for each NPC so it's easy to see when people are hurt.  And finally, having played Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II, Icewind Dale etc, the spell names, types, and effects in Planescape are totally awesome and in keeping with the surreal and twisted landscape.  This is not a game to be missed.	1
After years of coveting my friends Super Nintendo, I finally got my first gaming console. In the Christmas of 1996, the Nintendo 64 arrived.  The Nintendo 64, or N64 as it is sometimes referred, followed in the wake of success of the first Sony console, the PlayStation, and started producing their games with 3D graphics. Instead of limiting the player to only being able to move forward and backward, or left and right, you could now move in all directions. This opened a portal for Nintendo to take some of their classic characters and put them in truly immersive worlds. For example, Mario was no longer a 16-bit side scrolling red and blue pixel, but a small Italian man with a healthy knack for adventure. Being able to see these characters up close and all around was something like we had never seen before. The result ended up being games like Super Mario 64, Star Fox 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and the countless hours and vivid gameplay that they would offer.  With a very simple design and set up like the previous 2 Nintendo consoles (SNES & NES) the 64 was another cartridge based Nintendo console with no load times and generally easy maintenance (remember blowing into the cartridges and consoles?). The controller however, was something that was dramatically different from both previous Nintendo consoles. This controller offered an analog stick and more than the standard 2 or 4 buttons. The analog stick was great for the 3D games and made it very easy to navigate, however, after enough hours of play it stop working in one way or another.  It's interesting to see how Nintendo has come full circle, evolving to something like the Nintendo 64 and in some ways digressing back to it's origins with games like New Super Mario Bros U, which is much like Super Mario Bros for SNES but with updated graphics and a few more tweaks.	1

This product does what it was made for great . Keep me pleased and happy to have it. If some one plan to get this product it great and works , your hard earn money will not go down the drain.	1
It came in pretty good condition,only thing that sucks is it didn't come with a expansion bay but they didn't origionally come with it so im not taking away stars.overall its perfect i will be getting the expansion soon	1
Wow. Those were my first words after playing Planescape: Torment for the PC. I have to tell you I am an avid fan of the Dungeon and Dragons Planescape Universe. I own almost every product made by TSR and was quite shocked to see that they were making a PC Game of Planescape. At first I thought it might be like Baldur's Gate. Sorry guys I wasn't really impressed by Baldur's Gate. But like I said after playing it for 30 minutes I was convinced that this was going to be the best game ever. It was really a well done game and faithful adaption of the Dungeon and Dragons Planescape Universe. There are so many good things to say about this game I don't know where to start. Well let me just tell you my favorite things about the game. First and foremost the story. Amnesia works well in a story if used properly, like Memento. That in itself is a great hook which will keep the player playing for hours just to find out who he is. And then I loved the different methods you could use for situations in the game. If you had hight Charisma or Intelligence you were given different dialogue choices that could change the the game. The first time I played I tried maxing out the Charisma, Intelligence and Wisdom stats so that I could regain more memories and have more things to say to the NPC's. That has to be a first in Dungeons and Dragons where I didn't try to get high Strength, Dexterity or Constitution scores. Unfortunately I never finished the game as it was very tough. So I missed out on a lot but what I did play was awesome. I went out and bought the novel, which was good by the way, and read the whole story. There was no way I was missing out on that story. And what a great story it was all the way up to the ending. So if you haven't played this game yet go out and buy it. Don't be deterred by the 2D graphics, once your in the game you won't even notice. In fact I just might load the game up and try to finish it this time.	1
Planescape: Torment has to be one of the BEST computer RPG games of all time!  It has everything one looks for in such a game; from an incredible setting, to a highly original plot, to excellent multiple roleplaying options, to outstanding graphics, to extraordinary accuracy in relation to Dungeons & Dragons, and much, much more!  There is something here for everyone as the variety of challenges is large indeed, including battles, puzzle solving, and dialogue among others.  The game is set in Sigil-the City of Doors- primarily, as well as various other locations within the Planescape multiverse, as it deals with the nameless hero and his efforts to find out more about himself after realizing that he has lost both his memory and his mortality.  The story as a whole is excellent!  The plot is so incredibly well written and presented that the gamer feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense.  Moreover, the game does a great job of presenting the distinct cultures and civilizations of the inhabitants of Planescape; Sigil, the Outlands, Baator etc.  This has, without a doubt, been achieved as a result of a great deal of research that has gone into learning and understanding the numerous and often complex characteristics of the Planescape multiverse.  Let me tell you, NOTHING, I say NOTHING, compares to the endless hours of gaming enjoyment that I have experienced playing Torment!  Strongly recommended to both Fantasy as well as Planescape enthusiasts along with the Baldur's Gate series.  Trust me, you will not regret it!  In conclusion, together with Planescape: Torment, Torment: the novel, is also recommended!  It is BASED on the computer game, therefore it only touches on a limited amount of material presented in the game, but it too is lots of fun!	1
Whoever doubts that computer gaming is an art-form should play PLANESCAPE-TORMENT.  Words fail to describe the perfect symphony of brilliant ideas, emerging story-line, beautiful environments, mesmerizing music, fun gameplay and detailed coding that makes this game an unsurpassed classic! I have yet to meet anyone who has played it and not raved about it!  NamelessOne and his companions are characters that will stay with you forever. The graphics may seem a bit outdated nowadays (they are the same as the first BALDUR's GATE, they share the same engine, Infinity); however, true RPG gamers know that graphics are not a self-sustained aim.  THIS IS NOT A NEW GAME. So do not expect an exploding eye-candy or a fast-paced game (try YouTube to check out whether this may not be your cup of tea). One has to let himself immerse into the world of the Planes and the doomed city of Sigil. But their magic shall always stay with you.  This used to be sold out game and could only be found in old stock houses and eBay. Count yourself lucky and treat yourself to this gem. Trust me, you have to have this one!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	1
best game since sliced bread.  Better than Ultima 7 or even 5.  Great grafix to boot.  The character developement is similar to 2nd ed except for wheapon prof and wisdom attribute's big debute for main PC.  The game deals with your lost memories and finding your way through dimensional gateways(aka Ultima, Dr. Who: Warrior's Gate, SG1 ect.)  If you don't know everything thier is to know about the "rules" then it's a lot more fun. the compainions are -holes I would've preferred the "Kirk, Spock, Bones" comradery in SOME of the characters as was present in Ultima 7(Shamino, Iolo, Dupre, & Mr. A), but the skull guy is fun and your Undead so SoB compainions is appropriate I guess.  Don't let sum D&D nerd tell you how to play, discover it yourself.  It also runs flawlessly on XP which is a huge + for a game of this age(1999 I think) patch to 1.1.	1
What kind of game can you write a paper about for English class, and still get a perfect grade on the paper?  This kind. What kind of game will have you thinking about it and replaying it for years at a time?  This kind. What kind of game will leave you literally praying for another game that rivals it?  This kind. Most of Black Isle's games were really good, but Planescape: Torment is nothing short of a masterpiece.  The lush gameworld, the extraordinarily intricate character interaction, and the terrific plot are all things that we have seen before and are likely to see again.  But, Planescape leaves you with something even more than a pleasant gaming experience; it leaves you with an entirely new perspective on life.  Without being brazen about it, Planescape demonstrates that tiny actions, miniscule decisions can change the nature of the universe; it also shows the affects of what I believe to be the most painful emotion within the human experience, regret.  At the same time as all this, Planescape is successful at being a remarkably good game, and it isn't preachy at all (in case you're worried that philosophy will override entertainment). This game is close to godliness; definitely my favorite game of all time.  Highly recommended.	1
You play the Nameless One as he begins his journey of self discovery.  You awaken on a slab in a mortuary with a floating skull who goes by Morte.  Morte reads you a crypic note tatooed to your back and thus begins your journey.  Oh by the way, you're an amnesiac and an immortal. A lot of the game takes place in Sigil (aka: The City of Doors, and the Cage) a circular city on the top of an infinetly tall spire at the direct center of the multiverse.  Sigil contains portals to everywhere in the multiverse...so its a pretty imortant place.  It is run by a mysterious woman known as the Lady of Pain.  She is very tall, floats above the ground, and is enshrouded by blades.  You do not want to meat her.  If you make her mad or even worship her, she'll either maze or kill you. Your journey to find out who you are will take you from the slums of the hive, to the depths of hell on Baator.  Along the way you will meet some very interesting people to help you along.  Among them are: Fall-From-Grace (a succubuss), Dakkon (a Githzeri), Vhailor (A dead Mercykiller whose spirit still inahbits his armor), Morte (a funny fl;oating skull), and many others.  The voice overs are all top notch.  Some of the best are voiced by Dan Castellenta (the simpsons) the voice of Dakkon is done by the man who plays A.D SKinner on the Xfiles. The story line is top notch.  Mixing in philosophy with life, death, and belief was just plain genious.  Once you get into this game you will not want to leave.  AS you go along your journey you will unravel more of your character's past lives and what kind of people he once was. This game really earns the M rating.  Not for being inappropriate.  It just deals with MAture subjects such as life: Life, Death, Torment, Belief, and relationships with others.  Torment is a recurring theme. Once I reached the end I was sad my journey was over.  I wished it were longer so I could have kept playing.  I wasn't impressed with the ending when I first saw it, but as I thought about it, it made perfect sense and was a perfect ending.  And the dialogue with Ravel and during and After the dialogue with the Transcendent One was marvelous.  These guys are talented! Pick up a copy of this best game ever and join the many who have undertaken the jounrey of self discover, belief, and their own torment.	1
The is one of the best AD&D games ever made. This game is different from all the other AD&D games out there. The setting and ideas in this game are the most interesting and involving of any AD&D game I've ever played. This game just rocks! 1) The graphics are a little dated and sometimes are hard to make out but don't let that distract you! 2) The sound, especially the voice acting is AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! 3) This is the only PlanceScape AD&D game available for the computer. 4) You can play this game as a hack and slash or with more panash as a wizard or Thief. Or you can play the game as all three, although your character would be too weak to be much good in endgame. 5) I love the character generation process. Really great! 6) Deep and engaging story! A real mystery that you can't stop playing, you are drawn to find out what's happening. In short, this is a great game!	1
Definately a great Black Isle game which deserves to sit in such high tiers as Fallout 1, Fallout 2, and Arcanum.  The story makes playing an Immortal fun for once (so read up, Soul Reaver makers).  The characters are imaginative and deep(and you can talk with the other characters in your party to enhance the story).  Find your journal, learn of your past, and for god's sake, use the sphere. You start out as a fighter, but you can quickly become a Thief or Wizard (just look around).  The story does hit home, but it could have used a better ending (no offense, this game earns 5 stars just playing it from one end to the other).  The payoff is getting there, not the end. This game puts you on a bumpy and fun ride.  Buy and enjoy.  BTW, Soul Bringer (the game this one is hooked to on a Duel Jewel) really bites in comparison.	1
Years after its release, Planescape: Torment is still the model for computer role playing games.  While the Infinity Engine is now dated and the resolution in this game is poor by today's standards, the presentation - setting, mood, colors, effects - is outstanding and should serve as a model for game design. Torment is based on AD&D rules and an overlooked AD&D campaign setting, Planescape.  Torment is true to its pen-and-paper roots, automating the cumbersome rules and allowing enjoyable, structured gameplay and character development.  The game is designed in the spirit of the Fallout series, Black Isle Studios' first smash-hit CRPG line, which means lots of reading and lots of interactive dialogue choices which monopolize a lot of game time.  The game uses a modified version of the Infinity Engine used in Bioware's "Baldur's Gate" series, also part of the family of AD&D-based CRPGs. The game puts you in the role of the Nameless One, a perfect character for customization and self-discovery, which are what make this game so attractive.  The story has several elements of the standard myth, but your character is strangely post-modern and existential.  You will encounter a wide variety of settings, styles, and characters as you travel around Sigil, the city at the center of the universe, and the worlds to which it is connected.  You will have an enormouse amount of freedom to act and explore, which may sometimes have you exploring for hours off the main track of the storyline.  Because of this, Planescape: Torment may take over 100 hours to complete just for the first time.  However, with sufficient focus I am certain it could be done in half that time. Replay value is high, because you can play the game with a different personality, play style, and different companions.  The game may seem to have dated graphics, but the sound is still top-notch, and the game programming is robust.  Load times may be hard to stomach, but it should be easier if you follow online instructions to move the entire game from CD to hard drive or virtual CD. Be careful, though, this game will cause you to want to talk about its philosophical ramifications to friends who will be absolutely lost after you get absorbed into the world of Planescape.  The game is best played in really big blocks of time (8+ hours) followed by reflection about how great the game is.  I'm serious about that. By all means, purchase a copy of this game and play it.  Play it like you mean it, and absorb everything the game has to offer in sound, mood, setting, and storyline.  Game designers take note: this game is what we should be making now, with today's audio and video capabilities.  Planescape: Torment has the best story of any game made to date, and it totally dominates the gameplay experience.  Thinking about this game gives me hope for the future of RPGs as interactive novels and world-as-playground games that tease the mind and excite the imagination.  This is the game that sets the bar for an entire genre.	1
I have missed this console. I cannot wait to regain my collection and play the games I used to play. Definitely worth it. Of course some of the nostalgia is lost because I am so much older now... But I still love it. I cannot wait for my children (when I eventually have them) to be able to play this. It is something that must never die.	1
It works above my expectations. I wish they Didn't demand a certain number of words since i don't have that much to say.	1
My current RPG is Planescape Torment. Black Isle studios release from a couple of years back. Developed primarly using Direct X functions, this game is similar to their other games that they have released, which take advantage of different aspects of TSR's universe. I like it so far, but my one complaint with it is that there is alot of talking to people and very little focus on advancing your characeter through battle. It would be nice to make the next title something more like the old Final Fantasy games. I was thinking of Neverwinter Nights or Dungeon Seige. I prolly go with the Nights.	1
After reading a description of the game I thought:"Hmmm well, sounds strange, but since it is the only RPG game around right now I might as well buy it". I started out with low expectations, boy was I wrong! In the game you play a scarred and unnamed immortal. Yes you read it right, I said Immortal. You can not die in this game(with a few exeptions). So you say, doesn't that take all the fun out of the game? No, it doesn't. After all, in all other games you just re-load a previous save untill you win the battle. The whole game is very plot-driven, and what a plot it is! There is alot of interaction with other characters around you, and the NPC's you can get to travel with you are very original indeed, this is definately not your standard, dwarf warrior or elf archer. There is a good amount of interaction between the NPC's in the group as well, and not just smalltalk, but also plotrelated conversations. As you travel on the plot continues to thicken and you find out a good deal about yourself, and your past lives. Another interesting feature is the way that you can "switch" between classes(eg. mage, warrior, cleric), this make your character very versatile, and enjoyable. The game is set in the city of Sigil, in the Planescape world. The planescape is not your average "Tolkienish" world, it is very strange and has alot of odd and different features compared to i.e. Forgotten Realms. This is not a game for everyone, I have met many people that found the setting and the story "too weird" or "too strange", although if found it very enjoyable, getting away from the average fantasy universe for a time. The dialogue is also some of the best I have seen in computer RPG's so far, long and detailed descriptions. Almost like having a Gamemaster in front of you instead of a computer. The graphics are somewhat gritty, but that only makes the mood stronger as the it fits the style of the game just perfect. I don't really like to compare Torment to other RPG's. It is difficult since it uses and entire different world and a very different gallery of persons. My personal opinion is, as you propably know, that this is one of the best Computer roleplaying games out there, underline ROLEPLAY.	1
I am in love with this N64, I had lost mine a long time ago, and to be able to buy one and play it again made me so very happy!	1
When me and my sisters all moved out one of my sisters took the N64 so I bought a new one to replace it and still be able to play some of the games that were mine that she didn't tale.	1
I originally bought this game as something to distract me while I waited for Throne of Bhaal to come out; never have I made a more wise purchase. Planescape: Torment is a remarkable game, with a wast array of sidequests, and where everything and everyone is somehow connected. The plot is somewhat mature, but the 3rd person perspective makes is much less graphic than games like Quake or Doom. The NPCs are very entertaining, and offer a vast array of skills and dialogue (I like the fact that the PC can initiate dialogue themselves). I like that the character's actions defined his alignment, not vice verse. I didn't like the limitations put on the main character's appearance and sex(as a female, I like to play w/ female PCs), but I didn't mind that much. I also liked that the area-affect spells didn't damage party members (as they do in the BG series). However, the first part of the game was quite confusing, and I had a tough time navigating through all the sections of the slums, and remembering where everything was (the programmers did include a handy map-marking feature which helps though). I also wish that there had been some expansion of some aspects in the game (such as the mysterious "Lady of Pain"), but far be it from me to complain. Since it doesn't appear that Amazon has this game in stock at the moment, I suggest that you drive to the nearest software storm and buy this game!!	1
Planescape Torment is the ultimate role-playing game that uses the D&D system -- a great balance of combat, quest-fulfilling, and most of all, storytelling.  I played the old Pool of Radiance game, Baldurs Gate, and Icewind Dale.  Planescape: Torment is better than them all.  But the game is not just a great D&D game.  It is a great role-playing and adventure game.  Every character trait matters.  Higher intelligence gives you access to more dialog options.  Higher wisdom allows you to accumulate memories and experience faster.  It is very rare to find a game that puts this kind of value on intellectual traits. As I mentioned, the biggest strength of this game is the story. It is eerie, dark, humorous, creative, compelling, exciting, and unpredictable, all at the same time.  It gets interesting in the first scene and stays that way until the excellent ending.  It is supported with brilliantly written dialogue and elaborately painted characters.  Unlike most games, the dialog is one of the highlights of the game.  Each character that joins the main character is deep and contributes value to the story.  The story in most games is hit-or-miss.  This one was a home run.  It's too bad that there aren't more like it out there. The graphics, more than two years after the game came out, still look good (although they are not cutting edge anymore).  The cinematic scenes are great, and the music is excellent too. If there is a shortcoming to the game, then it is the combat system itself.  The feedback during combat isn't very good, which sometimes leaves you wondering why one of the characters is taking damage, or why your spell didn't work.  The variety of weapons and especially spells is decent, but nowhere close to the variety offered by other D&D games.  For instance, there are only two fifth level priest spells in the game.  The combat is still fun though, and there isn't an excessive amount of it. If you are looking for a great story-driven, role-playing game, and not just a hack-and-slash game, then this is the game for you.	1
I decided to buy an old N64 recently even though the majority of official Nintendo Games can be bought for the Wii and Wii U's virtual consoles. I have gotten back into the Mario Party series and used to own Mario Party 1 for my old N64 which I sadly sold, so I decided, being the collector that I am, to purchase an old N64, games, and paraphernalia.  The N64 Console I got came with the Expansion Pak (which allows you to play later games released for the N64) and the cables but no controller but you can easily purchase a retro knock-off version for only 15 extra bucks on amazon, also. I was really dreading the possibility that my new N64 would not be compatible with my Emerson HDTV, but the cables it came with included the usual AV cables that most Nintendo systems use (i.e. Gamecube and Wii). I hooked it up to my HDTV, flipped the switch, and she works like a charm.  Now for some light pros and cons for the younger gamers who didn't grow up with the N64 but are used to the era of Wii/PS3/X-360: Cons: - No 3D glasses come in the package, but that's okay since this predates 3D in the general population of Video Games - The Games come in Cartridge format, not Disc, because that was Playstation and Sega's turf at the time - You can't hook it up to a TV with an HDMI Cable - Most of the games may be pretty familiar to even casual gamers of Nintendo family games, but they also don't feature motion controllers - The Graphics are 64-bit, in other words, they look incredibly dated on a HDTV. - No Wi-Fi since it wasn't invented back in the 90s - You can't play NES or SNES games on it, to my knowledge - Remember, if you buy later games for the N64 such as Kirby 64, Paper Mario, or Mario Party 3, you will probably need the Expansion Pak because it can handle the slightly improved graphics.  Pros: - For those of you who are serious collectors of rare and old video games like me, this is a must since it was the first major Nintendo Gaming Console to feature 3D Graphics in almost all games. - Also, if I am correct, the games that require the N64-Memory Card are not available on the Virtual Console, and you can play games like Quest 64 or Lego Racers for the Nintendo 64 without having to worry about losing data every time you turn the console off if you have one of those.  So, to sum things up, buying an N64 if you are a casual gamer who is not too interested in gaming history is not the smartest move, but for diehard Nintendo Fans like me who want a little retro action? This is a must buy.	1
If you like killing many monsters, killing and killing and killing, just like in diablo and diablo 2; or if you usually play RPGs with only one character for more experience, then it is not a game for your taste. What makes torment a great game is the interactions between your group members,  quests (that many of them don't even involve killing), and wonderful reflection of the planescape universe.  If action is more important for you than non-killing quest experience, if you easily get bored of long text dialogues (some of them don't have anything to do with the storyline, but very helpfull to understand the planescape universe if you had no experience with it before), then buy ice wind dale or diablo2 expansion.  Ice Wind dale involves linear story line, much less interaction with npc s, more monsters and more experience. What may be a con-pro for this game? 1- It shows its age.  Its been about two years since the release of the game, and although it uses the same graphic engine with icewind dale and baldurs gate2, it is not advanced as they are in the graphics.  Resolution is limited to 640x480, but because it had very well designed backgrounds and character models, you don't even notice the negatives.  What makes it better than icewind dale and baldurs gate2 in graphics, in my opinion, is the way the npc s are designed.  In baldurs gate and icewind dale, if you have a thief character for example, unless you buy a different armor it looks like the rest of the thiefs in the town.  While in torment each npc that can be added to your group, has its own design and sound.  Believe me ,in baldurs, it really gets boring to hear the same voice from all mages while they are casting, while in torment your npc mages has their own voices. 2- slowing down bug: The game has a bug that, whatever your processor speed is, under some circumstances the game really slows down. 1.1 patch reduces much of it, but still happens sometimes. 3- POSSIBLE SPOILER! Map: Unless you reach the lower ward, you cant click on some place in the world map and go there.  You have to run through the whole sigil to reach somewhere far away, until you complete about 1/3 of the game.  It really gets boring sometimes. 4- Loading scenes: In baldurs 2 and icewind dale, loading times are reduced.  Also in baldurs2, most of the time, entering a house does not need a load.  Torment uses the unmodified version of the bioware engine and every time the environment changes, it loads from the cd.  You may reduce the loading time by doing a full install, but there isn't an option for it in the installation screen.  You have to manually copy some files from the cd s and do some editing in ini files.  Go and check the black isle web site for that. 5- while playing, you feel that there is a living city around you.  Npcs walk around, talk with each other, react when a fight occurs near them. Also for npc s in your group, you really feel that they have their own ideals, their own stories which are incredibly connected to your characters past. 6- Nameless One (you): It is the only reason enough to play this game.  An amnesiac immortal, in search of his past and his mortality. As you learn more about him and how he caused the things that others called fate, it becomes harder to quit playing. Suggestion to hardcore gamers: If you want to get much more pleasure from the game, before playing it read something about planescape universe, bloodwar, sigil and lady of pain. You will catch some small details about nameless one's past and understand much better what happens to him at the end of the game (many people don't understand the purpose of the ending demo) and will have increadibly more enjoyable playing time than an average gamer has. Play it as a fighter than as a mage, they are much different in playing. Whatever class you choose to play, always create a character of wis:18 and int:18, even if you are a fighter.  Torment is mostly a non-combat rpg and these attributes determine your exp level, amounts of memories you recall(and you learn much more abaout his past)and the number of dialogues that appear during the speech.  You gain attribute points as nameless one remembers his past, so a low str or con is not a problem for a fighter, also don't forget that you are already an immortal. :) Buy it, it is an incredible game.	1
I wasn't really excited about the game at first. But I found that the escape from the mortuary was just a tutorial: the real stuff was ahead. I got really emersed in the story and found myself talking to characters for hours on end, not because I wanted to earn some XP, but really because I was interested, I wanted to learn more of this strange world, I wanted to know about Sigil, the Planes, my lost memories, my destiny. I didn't play the game for the combat. I had choosen to be a warrior, but I found myself assigning more and more points to wisdom and intelligence, to improve my dialog choices and regain more memories. I played it for weeks on end, exploring every dialog option, trying everyting, just to find out more about the strange places I found myself. After such a great game, I found the final showdown a little disappointing, but, as I sayd - its not all about combat. It didn't stop me from playing it again a year afterwards. This game isn't my second all-time favorite for nothing! Get this game....	1
Planescape: Torment is one of the deepest and thought-provoking games I have ever played. In that respect it resembles great literature -- it tackles the human condition and asks as its central question: "What can change the nature of a man?" As a game, PS:T straddles the boundary between Role-Playing and Adventure; unlike most RPG's, you do not create your own character but rather assume the role of The Nameless One. However, you have complete control over how "TNO" evolves, from his skills to his morality. This restriction allows the game to be so focused, but it can also be a turn-off for more free-wheeling gamers. Similarly, your choice of companions and the plotline are also bounded, which for me is also a strength but for others may be restrictive. The game displays incredibly deep writing and thought: all of the major characters, including yourself and your companions, are complex, deep /people/ with personalities, motives, and quirks. The way your companions interact with each other -- and with others -- can be delightfully entertaining. (In exchange for less control over your party, you gain this incredibly rich set of personalities). Your own character evolves with every decision you make; tell a lie and you become less Lawful; act selflessly and you become more Good. I would recommend this game not simply as one of the most entertaining titles you'll ever pick up, but also as a work of art, a glimpse at the intersection between gaming and literature.	1
.... For anyone who hasn't played this game and is looking for a good role-playing or adventure game, I can highly recommend this game. There is little I can say that previous reviewers have not already covered, but Planescape is an excellent example of what a role-playing game should be. Even though the graphics are no longer on the cutting edge, the game itself easily stands the test of time. Planescape: Torment represents a fantastic creative achievement, with a strange and twisted land that has been painstakingly fleshed-out for gamers to explore. The game world features an astonishing number of areas to explore. It is also very flexible -- there are many ways to accomplish tasks, from using force to smooth talking to magic means. You can choose to be evil, cruel, or callous. Perhaps you'd rather be benevolent, helpful, even generous. Unlike most role-playing games, you don't have a fixed class and you do not choose your own alignment. Your actions determine your alignment over time, and you can change your class at will. The result is a very rare game that gives gamers a real opportunity to role play, one where characters react to you based on what you've done in the past. And the story itself is absolutely compelling and fascinating, a story so complicated that one playing will not be enough to reveal all its subtleties. This game is not as well-known as Black Isle's more popular Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series, but it may actually be the best of the bunch. It should easily run on all but the very slowest computers. I can go on and on about how good this game is... how good the voice acting is, making the characters seem even more life-like... how original the game world is... but you should find out for yourself. If you're a fan of role-playing games, you should not miss Planescape: Torment.	1
Great product works fine, smells a little different but this might just be the age. Company had it protected in a box and it works 100 percent. Not a 5 star because of smell	1
I have to admit, I was a bit concerned at the outset; aside from Lords of Magic, I've never been too big on games where you control only one character in your party, and the lack of ability to select an original class had me a bit worried. Wrong I was. This is definitely a keeper.  The premise is a bit like that of the film Mirage; your character wakes up, with no memory, and has to figure out where he is and what he's doing there. The "where" part comes along pretty quickly; he's in Sigil, the home of plane-hopping extraterrestrials and weird beings from other planes. The "why" is the true meat of the game, and it's quite nice that while the developers were working so hard at tweaking the game's responses to be tailor-made to your character, they didn't forget to include a plot compelling enough to bring players back to the game day after day.  If you haven't picked it up yet, especially if you've played the other games using the Inifinty engine, give it a shot. It's different enough from them to hold your interest but similar enough that your learning curve should be next to zero.	1
You've probably read about how much story and text Planescape throws at you.  Some might consider this a bad thing, but I can vouch that all of verbiage they give you is GOOD.  I knew this was a different, better kind of game when I started out in a mausoleum filled with zombies.  Not just repetitive undead attackers, though -- each zombie had its own description and characteristics, and for the first time in a game I got the feeling that these undead were actual former people -- very creepy.  Farther on you are exposed to the troubled pasts of the main character and his cohorts, but not all at once; your companions react to each other and the things that happen to you.  Talk to them periodically and different options open up.  Not to mention all of the existential issues that are explored with the main character, who is immortal but can't remember his past incarnations.  Some people have noted that maybe P:T presents you with too much storyline, and doesn't let you role-play enough, but there is still ample opportunity to affect your character's standing both with your stats (wisdom is important even though your character can only be a fighter, mage, and thief) and with your actions within the game. Then again, if all the text bores you, you can probably just ignore it and play through a worthy successor to Baldur's Gate.  It's obviously very similar in gameplay to BG (same company, same engine), which includes the good (strong combat engine, good graphics, great sound and music) with the bad (iffy pathfinding, and sort-of non-linearity, except you are obligated to do most of the unrelated side quests just to build up enough experience to get through the main quest).  BG is a good game, and is definitely longer than P:T, but I liked Planescape better anyway because of the atmosphere the story added, and because there was always something compelling for your character to do (unlike BG where sometimes you were just clearing out area after area).	1
Doesn't work, I was told it was in working order and just needed cables now I am being told I need to purcdhase more for it to make it actually work, which I don't believe I had 1 of these systems for 15 yrs and had no problems.	-1
A wonderful story and really intresting charecters. Here is my pros and cons Pros: *Magnificent 3D graphics from Black Isle studios, creators of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale *Not-your-everyday charecters, such as a floating skull, a walking-and-talking suit of armor, and a woman with a tail(a.k.a. tiefling) *Game play based on D%D 3rd Edition Rules *Powerful enemies such as Wererats,Wyverns,Zombies,Ghouls,and Street Slugs Cons: A small game, only 900 MB and 4 cds Bird-eye view means medium sized land Only can have 5 other charecters in your party Still, not that bad. A good game for D&D fans!	1
This is an RPG with style. In fact, it has more style than all the other Infinity Engine games combined. The story is creative, enthralling, and very astounding. The characters are original and highly interactive. You can see that a writer designed this game. What is not happening in this game is combat and action. The player is going along for the ride instead of taking a direct hand. There is also not much customization. Character creation is simplistic with only a meaningless choice between three different classes that don't make any difference over all. Still, it's a good game for those who are cerebral and don't have an itchy trigger finger.	1
What a game!  I've just seen the end-game sequences today, and that means  my personal Torment has just started.  Since I've already played Fallout 2,  how will I ever find another game this good? Heavily scarred and  tattooed, your character, the Nameless One, awakes on a mortuary slab and  the first sound you hear is the smart mouthed floating skull, Morte, the  first of your companions on of your journey.  Morte is a floating  repository of knowledge, which is just as well since it turns out you've  died, come back to life and lost your memory ... again.  When Morte  translates the tattoos on your back, you get the first clues about the  cycle of life and death you've become trapped in.  In your search as an  amnesiac immortal to find out what's been happening to you and who is  behind it all, you get to explore and meet many of the strange denizens of  the Planes, performing quests in return for knowledge.  Some of those who  know the most about your past consent to join you - it would be great if  the party size could accommodate all of them. Almost as quickly as you  realise this ain't Kansas, it becomes obvious Planescape: Torment is not  your average hack'n'slash RPG.  In fact, too much bloodshed will find you  "mazed" (I had to restart!) by the Lady of Pain who watches over Sigil, the  "City of Doors", the Plane which houses the Mortuary, and which contains  portals to many other Planes if you have the right keys.  Most  confrontations are best sorted out by words, and this may be a problem with  some players, as you have to wade through a HUUUUGE amount of text and  dialogue to resolve these encounters in a peaceful fashion.  In fact, I've  recently read that Feargus Urquhart of Black Isle Studios said the  incredible amount of dialogue that needed to be written almost killed the  guys working on it, and sometimes I thought the bizarre and esoteric nature  of some of it was going to cause my brain to self combust, but it all added  to the rich texture and complexity of the game.  It's a good idea to save  often, because it's easy to accidentally offend someone while tip-toeing  through the diplomatic minefield and suddenly find yourself in a fight to  the death with someone who shouldn't be killed. You start the game either  as a Fighter, Mage or Thief, but can change professions during the game, as  you need.  However, it's important to specialise sooner or later, as there  are only so many experience points to go around.  Unlike other AD&D  games, you don't get to decide your character's alignment during character  generation - this changes according to your actions throughout your  travels.  And when you level, you get points with which you can increase  attributes, such as Strength and Wisdom, so you can start out as a pretty  mediocre Mage, and end up a mental giant, if that is your path.  Like all  AD&D games, Planescape: Torment is full of items and artefacts, often  only usable by certain professions, which can temporarily change  statistics.  As usual, you need these things most in the beginning, when  you can least afford them. Set in the bizarre, surrealistic world of the  Planes, designing Planescape: Torment must have been an experience.  How  many times have we played games supposedly set in an alternate reality, but  where the buildings look eerily similar to ours?  The external architecture  of Planescape: Torment's buildings, many of which served no apparent  purpose, looks like something Gaudi could have designed had he been on  crack!  The interiors, however, are usually disappointingly familiar.  Some  of the spells, and there are many, are worth learning and casting just to  see the effects!  Members of your party have their own little  idiosyncrasies (Annah's tail-flicking, Morte's eye-rolling, and Dak'kon  constantly sipping from his flask) and like to chat or argue among  themselves - which can be disconcerting just when you're about to wade into  battle! Although Planescape: Torment uses the same engine as Baldur's  Gate, the "camera" is closer to the ground, thus making the characters and  their immediate environment quite detailed.  However, this makes everything  very close, so ranged weapons are useless and by the time some spells are  cast, the foes are beating the @$#%^ out of you (some can't be negotiated  with!), or with some of the area spells, you get hurt as much as the enemy.  You have to learn very quickly what works.  The music score, although  sometimes tedious after many hours, contains some great themes -  Deionarra's theme in particular is so hauntingly beautiful it was worth  visiting her just to hear it.  The voice cast, containing some reasonably  well known actors, is largely wasted since, except for a few introductory  phrases, most dialogue is text.  However, among others, you will hear  Michael T. Weiss (The Pretender), Mitch Pileggi (X Files), Dan  Castellanetta (Simpsons), John DeLance ("Q" in Star Trek: TNG) and who knew  this is what Sheena Easton has been getting up to lately. I must admit  that when I first read about Planescape: Torment and read the box, I  thought it would be too "dark" and bizarre for me.  Then I thought these  other people awarding 5 stars can't all be wrong, so thank goodness I  changed my mind.  Even so, it was several hours before I "got  it".  Apparently, due to the reason stated above, while not ruling out  the possibility, the guys at Black Isle are in no particular hurry to get  started on a sequel.  I hope they recover soon and get started, because I'm  already waiting. In its latest issue, my favourite gaming magazine here  in Australia listed Planescape: Torment as the second best game ever,  beaten only by Deus Ex.  For me, even though it's like comparing apples and  oranges, it's a dead heat for first place - Fallout 2 and Planescape:  Torment (but then, I haven't played Deus Ex!)	1
If you've ever played Baldur's Gate this game should be fairly familiar to  you.  It uses the TSR D&D rules (although instead of having your stats  rolled out for you it assigned a certain number of points you have to  spend) and many of the creatures that inhabit the D&D world. You play  the Nameless One, a man who dies and comes back to life over and over  again.  You have bo idea who you are or what you're doing, and have nothing  to guide you except a note tattooed on your back telling you to go visit a  man named Pharod.  From there you're plunged into a great long adventure  all about finding out who you are and how you came to be what you  are. The perspective is akin to Baldur's gate and Diablo, although unlike  those games there are no multiplayer capabilities.  You still are able to  pick up companions in the game such as Morte the floating talking skull,  Annah the red haired half-demon woman with a rat's tail, Ignus the fire  elemental, and many others.  All of them have their own skills and their  own personalities.  (Quite often they'll bicker at each other!) I really  loved the myriad of sub-quests in this game that you can run through or  avoid at your leisure, and also the fact that most of the experience points  earned in the game come from TALKING to people and discovering new things  instead of just bashing lots of monsters -- although there are plenty of  monsters to bash as well. As you progress your actions determine what  alignment your characters is, and you have the option of being a fighter, a  mage, or a thief as you progress.  It's a really great game with plenty to  do and tons of entertainment time. And remember to ask yourself,  "What can change the nature of a man?"	1
I really like this Console. Nintendo 64 is the best Nintendo Console they have made! I like it and everyone should have one because it's fun!	1
The nintendo 64 is a classic system. From super smash bros to mariokart 64 you can't go wrong. I love my new nintendo 64 but the gamecube is better.	1
Great working console. I love using it to play my favorite old games. Glad I ordered one, nothing beats the good ol' N64.	1
Decent graphics, but a little slow in areas, especially with multiple spells going off at once.  Besides that, pretty good plot, decent leveling ability, and VERY nice fighting.  I think you'll enjoy.  Just be sure to  have a 3D graphics card enabled, and some decent RAM.	1
I was interested in "Planescape: Torment" because for years I've missed the thrills of playing AD&D in my friend's basement.  15 years in fact, but I still remember the rules and the spells, the races and  classes, etc.  I've played other computer RPGs (going back to Pool  of Radiance), but none really could bring back any of the real excitement  of AD&D.  Happily, "Planescape: Torment"  does.  Granted, it's not quite the real thing, but it's close enough  that I've spent many happy hours playing the game, working my way through  the remarkably interesting story, and enjoying the combat.  If you  can't find the time or companions for some good old gaming,  "Planescape: Torment" is a good substitute.	1
I've role-played since the 70s, and have probably played every RP game that's come out since that date, including recent reviews for BellaOnline.com. My first assumption was that Planescape would be a  knock-off of Baldur's Gate, and be fun but not unique. It is, amazingly,  far more than that. Sure, it's built on the same great engine that  Baldur's Gate was. Same third person view, with the great graphics and  sounds that BG is famous for. However, the developers of Planescape  definitely knew what they were doing when they enhanced the system. They  addressed many complaints gamers had with BG, and took it to another level. Take death. Yes, that pesky death stuff that seems to happen to gamers  when they encounter a group of basilisks or perhaps a bandit or three. No  problem for Planescape - you're immortal! Not only that, but deaths  actually help you sometimes, jarring loose memories that were until that  point hidden. Like who you are. What you're about. Why you're immortal when  apparently nobody else is. Which brings me to another point - the  storyline is great! They take an idea that has definitely been done before  - you wake up with amnesia, uncertain of your past or present. Nine Princes  of Amber is a famous story that does this very well. So you learn as you  go, with the help of your amusing sidekick, the skull named Morte. Yes,  your pal is a floating skull who follows you along :) The game is  understandably "dark". You are, after all, someone who keeps  rising from the grave, wandering around a miserable little town full of  unhappy people. It's probably not a game for 6 year olds, but most  teenagers will easily relate to the misery of the town's occupants. You  find things like clot charms to help heal your wounds, bandages to tape  yourself back up. It's the same quests and challenges, but it's so much  more ... Your alignment actually alters as you interact with NPCs. Keep  doing good things - your alignment is naturally good. Keep slaughtering  innocents while they plead for mercy, and yup, you're bad. Your alignment  then affects how people react to you. Even better - your intelligence  determines what you can say or do in some cases!  No more of this idiotic  barbarian easily figuring out how to deal with a noble negotiator. I was  impressed! There are all sorts of twisted plot items that are clear  indicators of the amount of work the designers put into thinking this  through. You wake up with a note to yourself carved in your own back. You  wander outside and find a note-zombie, with notes stuck to his body. Every  doorway can be a portal to another world, if you find the key. But keys can  be anything - a piece of paper, a certain person, even a song sung in a  certain way. The game is definitely a thinking game - one created for  true strategists and role players, who want a challenge out of a game and  not just a hack-fest. For gamers who have complained that RP could never be  fun on a computer, try Planescape Torment. You just might have your hands  full!	1
The console has worked perfectly so far.  It shipped pretty quickly, and the price was reasonable.  I really appreciated the controller and game that were thrown in.	1
For me the Nintendo 64 Video Game Console has taken me back to my college days where I spent hours checking out mentally after a hard day of studying.  My system came in tact with one controller but all of the other essential parts needed. It connected easily to my modern HDTV and looks great. No problems after about of month of using it at least three times per week and still going strong.  If you want to experience some of that throw back nostalgia, take the plunge and buy it! You deserve it. :)	1
I'm a big fan of Baldur's Gate and the Fallouts, so naturally I went and bought the next series, Planescape Torment.  What I was confronted with was a game rich in storyline and graphic detail, but on the playability end as  compared to the other RPG's released by Interplay, I knew issues were at  hand.  The game runs slow sometimes even if you have a super PC and the  patch is virtually a must if you want fully enjoy the game. First and  foremost, I am a huge fan of Bioware.  I think they have done wonders for  both PC RPG's and  also bringing AD&D to the computer.  But, After I  was a few hours into the game, I was hit with the cold similarity that  Planescape Torment was very easily compared to the Fallout series.  It  seemed to me strongly that the Planescape Torment setting was awfully close  to the Fallout games.  I'm not too much into conspiracies, but I'll put my  money on it that this game was a result of a dropped project to make  Fallout 3 using the Baldur's Gate Engine.  The graphics, the screen font,  the dark settings, they all fit Fallout.  This was a bummer to me, and I  almost felt like I was playing a thrown together project saved by a team of  fans from the Planescape setting. But, I can't let that ruin the game.  It is a very intelligent game, and certainly not one for kids in terms of  understanding and content.  The dialogue and intrigue are very intense and  do make you part of the game and your character, much more than almost any  game I've played before.  That is not an easy feat for a PC game. My  final analysis is that this may not be a game for fans of Baldur's Gate or  Fallout, and with the later fans you will absolutely see what I'm saying  when comparing Planescape to the post-apocalyse setting.  That is where my  fifth star dissapeared to.  All in all, this is an excellent roleplaying  game, but not for all RPG fans.  This is a thinking game, not a combat  game.  A job well done once again at Bioware.	1
Let me put it straight for everyone. The Nentendo 64, (or N64 as I call it) was the greatest system of its time and then some. Not only was it's technology super advanced for its time, the game selection was outstanding. My mom and step dad bought me the system Christmas of 1996 with my first game being WCW vs NWO. I have had it ever since and still play it often and it has never had any problems with me. Thats almost 20 years of playing! Try doing that with a PS3 or 360.  I have had many games, and wish I still had the original copies bought for me when I was young. But then the PS2 came out and I traded a lot of those games for Sony garbage. Some of the classic games I've owned or currently own were/are  Super Mario 64 (my original copy from 96, still works and by far on of the best games in history) StarFox 64 (second favorite, play it all the time still) WWF No Mercy (groundbreaking wrestling game of its time) Conkers Bad Fur Day (Most controversial game of all time until GTA: San Andreas) WCW vs. NWO (My first game and it still works great!) Star Wars: Podracer (this game is responsible for riding my motorcycle too fast) Star Wars: Naboo Star Wars: Rouge Squadron ExciteBike Tony Hawks Pro Skater  The list goes on and on...  Case in point, N64 = best and most reliable system of all time. There will never be another like it.	1
NES is the best ever, SNES was great but N64 for me had no games that were nearly as memorible.  I enjoyed Doom 64, WCW/NWO games, MK Trilogy, Goldeneye, Banjo Kazooie and thats about it but again nothing really memorible.  The grapics were new at the time but look like total garbage now and I have no desire to play the N64 but I still play NES to this day.	-1
In addition to being a superb CRPG, this game is very different than other games - simply because the story is such a good story. If this was a book,  I would say it is awesome - how many computer games do you know you could  say that for?	1
I admit to stumbling across this game by accident at the local Computer swap market. I'd already played Baldur's Gate, and I'd felt that the AD&D Universe wasn't really for me. So I was pleasantly surprised by  Planetscape:Torment. Planetscape has improved markedly over its  predecessor. The most obvious difference is in its User Interface. You can  access items, inventory and spells using the main interface. In battle, you  can access each character's spells or items by right-clicking each  character. In Baldur's Gate, a characters spells and items were displayed  on the bottom window, which restricted your view. There's no such problem  here. Another difference is in the graphics. Planetscape still uses the  Infinity Engine (ala' Baldur's Gate), but the graphics are much smoother  than its predecessor. Characters are much larger, and some even perform  actions when they are idle. For instance, Morte (the first person to join  your group) juggles his eyeballs when he's bored. The main attractions in  Planetscape are, I feel, the most important elements of any game -  characterisation and storyline. The characters are NOT your ordinary  AD&D fighters and mages. For example, we have Morte, a floating skull  that uses his teeth as an attack weapon. Then there is Dakkon, who carries  what appears to be a lightsaber as his weapon. He is also a mage, which  means he can cast some impressive spells. Then there is Nordom (who you can  find if you embark on an extremely difficult quest) who is a robot carrying  crossbows. And Ignus, a chaotic mage made entirely of flame. The  storyline is also intriguing. Imagine playing a character who CANNOT be  killed, who is extremely powerful but has lost all memory of his abilities.  The Nameless One is probably the most mysterious character to ever be  created in a computer game - and his story ranks as one of the best ever  told. There are only two minor, niggling, flaws in this game. The first  is the failure to display graphics any higher than a 640x480 resolution.  Having the ability to display a much higher resolution would allow more of  the buildings to be seen. This would make the map easier to navigate. The  other flaw is the failure to implement Aureal 2.0 support (Baldur's Gate  had the same problem). Anyone with a Sound Blaster Live! should be able to  enjoy EAX support however, so all is not lost. In summary, if anyone is  interested in exploring the AD&D universe, I strongly recommend you  start with Planetscape: Torment. The game is much easier for first-timers  (like myself) to play, and less frustrating as well. Planetscape is not a  violent game, instead, its emphasis is on problem solving, not dungeon  hacking. Many situations can be solved through talking with characters, not  bludgeoning them to death. I sincerely hope that more games like this are  produced.	1
The system works incredibly well and i needed to beat mario 64 or i was sure to collapse hehe .	1
The Nintendo 64 systems works excellent without any complaints. Brings back memories playing this when I was younger. I would do business again with the seller.	1
You may not know this but the N64 was 64 Bit And it looks way better than the jaguar The games that made me play the N64 were Mario 64, Mariokart 64, OOT, and MM	1
The N64 is one of the top 3 systems ever released by Nintendo along with SNES and Wii. The game library is pretty large and boasts a variety of racers, shooters, and rpgs/platform rpgs. The N64 gave us that first glimpse of extremely open world game play and 3D characteristics. This was the last system to feature cartridge based games with quick load times. In an era when Playstation was marketing their franchises like Crash Bandicoot and Tomb Raider, Nintendo took a more "fun" approach to the N64. One of the greatest things about the N64 is that it's built very sturdy and strong. The console and games can take a pretty good beating and still keep on working. There are a good variety of games that are fun for the whole family. I think this is a great console to own for anyone who was a gamer in the 90s or anyone looking for a starter console for their kids.  If you're new to the N64 and looking for some suggestions, here's a few MUST OWN:  Zelda Ocarina of Time Mario 64 Mario Kart 64 Donkey Kong 64 Goldeneye 007 Banjo and Kazooie Harvest Moon 64 Mortal Kombat Trilogy Starfox 64 Zelda Majoras Mask	1
Ever played N64? If you haven't your in for a treat. There are SO many awesome, classic games for this amazing system. You'll be blown away by the fact that the grahpics are so good for a system as old as N64. If you do purchase this system, also purchase the following games: Super Smash Brothers, Diddy Kong Racing & Pokemon Stadium. Those are my favorites! Enjoy the N64, because I know I do/am.	1
Back in the day--and by that I mean the late 90's--my family and I owned our own Sony Playstation console. It was an amazing console with games such as Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon. Without any real competition from Sega during the mid 90's, Playstation and the Nintendo 64 struggled to show everybody who was the best.  Released in 1996--about 2 years after the debut of the Playstation console--the Nintendo 64 picked up steam fast. Games such as Super Mario 64, Zelda's Ocarina of Time, and Mario Kart 64, it's no wonder Nintendo's new system did so well.  So now let's see just how the Nintendo 64 compares to the Playstation. For starters, the picture clearly indicates one thing the Playstation didn't have: four controller ports. The only way to play with four players on the Playstation was to attach a multi-tap to its front. In terms of the controllers themselves, the Playstation wins; with its sleek, ergonomic design and simple button layout, it's no competition. The Nintendo 64, on the other hand, has an awkward-to-handle controller with three handles--almost as if Nintendo expected there to be gamers with three hands looking for a new Nintendo console. The only thing better about the Nintendo 64's controller is how it was the first to have a built-in thumbstick--which Sony later took to but into their Dualshock controller.  Another thing you may notice about the Nintendo 64 is how it has a cartridge slot--as opposed to the Sega Saturn and Playstation having disc drives. Because of the Nintendo 64's lack of a disc drive, its games cannot hold the space or audio quality of disc-based games. But--because the discs are on cartridges--the long loading times we experience with the Playstation are virtually nonexistent here.  As Nintendo's last home console to use cartridges and their first console to use 3D 64-bit graphics, it became a major success. Its games set the status quo for many 3D platformers, 3D racers, and adventure games to come.	1
this is a very fun console,although the system is outdated the games are still really fun.the really good games are nintendo made like super mario 64 or paper mario.	1
this is really the last system that Nintendo made great after that the systems went down hill.  the wii is terrible not the best graphics and the games are just so stupid.  the game cube also the same thing as the wii.  the 64 is the last true Nintendo system.	1
just bought this system to go back to the 4 player classics such as Mario cart, Mario party, and super smash bros. I am a huge Xbox 360 fan and still love this system, but it is amazing how far video games have advanced in 10 years.	1
The N64 was Nintendo's 3rd console (not counting the Game Boy, and Virtaul Boy).It came out shortly after the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation. If you don't have this system anymore or never have. And collect systems and and games, then I recommend this system. The controller has always at first glace seemed like a gimmick. And like myself, probably made you think how are people supposed to use that controller. But it actually isn't too bad! The system it's self is pretty simple, yet cool looking. And is for the most part really reliable. And having 4 controller ports is a plus too! Though it would have been nice if Nintendo released more mature games for the console, there are some classic games. I recommend the games below.  007 Golden Eye Mortal Kombat Trilogy Mario Kart 64 WCW NWO Revenge Resident Evil 2 Super Mario 64 F-Zero Ready 2 Rumble Legend Of Zelda Ocarina Of Time Star Wars Shadows Of The Empire NBA Hangtime DOOM 64 NFL Blitz Killer Instinct Gold Bio Freaks and WAYNE Gretzky's 3D Hockey to name a few to start with.	1
The Nintendo 64 is a lot of fun, and it is well-made, too.  Mine works like new and is about 10 or 11 years old right now.  There are a lot of fun games and it has all right graphics and good sound.  Even though it's kind of old, I still have a lot of fun with this console. One thing to keep in mind is you may need to add some things to it.  Some games require a memory card, which plugs into the controller, and some need an expansion pack, which plugs into the console.  You can add a rumble pack if you want, but that's not required.  It should come with 2 controllers, but you can have up to 4.	1
I shouldn't have to tell you this, but go buy this game system. If you had to decide between a Playstation and an N64 there is no doubt I'd buy an N64. With at least 30-40 revolutionary titles and also being one of the first "3D" consoles I'd say if you don't have this system or didn't in the past you simply did not have a childhood. In my opinion the 90s was the best decade of ALL TIME. And it's because of this right here, thank you Japan, thank you Nintendo. You can get this for about $20 used. Seriously?! That's insanely cheap for something this great. BUY IT. NOW.	1
nintendo 64 is the best video game console in the world a true classic the best of the best all the n64 games rock games like super mario 64,goldeneye,the turok trilogy,castlevania 64,star wars shadows of the empire,kirby 64,donkey kong 64,jet force gemini,both zelda games,paper mario,mega man 64,resident evil 2,quest 64,earthworm jim 3-d and so much more buy this system if your a old-school video game fan you won't be sorry	1
So I got a N64 (on Amazon) about a year ago.  I've been wanting one since I was young. I love this old video game console!  I think it's a great system and there are fun games for it.  It's too bad that the old systems and games are forgotten as the new ones come.  I know the Wii is a great system (and the WiiU is going to be the best!!!), but the old systems are still fun. :)	1
In a time where the Internet is being seen by several people, and consoles try to take advantage of it, and those consoles would run on CDs, the Nintendo 64 had arrived into the scene. It didn't run on CDs, but cartridges. It had no online support whatsoever. But you know what? It sold well.  Nintendo had, once again, revolutionized the gaming industry with their move of making the Nintendo 64. How? Because of Super Mario 64, one of the first games for the system.  Having 4 players instead of 2 add up to the fun that you would probably have when playing games like Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Mario Party, and Goldeneye 007.	1
After the startling success of Nintendo's NES and Super SNES video game systems, they had a tentative agreement with Sony to introduce a disc-based console to the public.  When the deal fell through, however, Sony decided to create the Playstation while Nintendo stuck with cartridges for one more go-round.  The "battle" proved to be roughly a draw if you can remember back to the actual period and not just remember the Playstation hype.  Back then, the console wars were all about two things: graphics and games.  Unlike today, where the graphics are so good that gameplay is brought into greater scrutiny, it seemed as if every game provided some new advance (or backpedal) in those two crucial categories.  Here is how the N64 rates:  Graphics: Clearly, the Playstation seems to have had the advantage in this category due to the larger memory space of a CD-Rom than a cartridge.  However, I would also challenge you to go back and play that original PS and tell me it doesn't look a little, well, goofy.  It was almost as if Sony had this great new technology but weren't really sure how to utilize yet, packing their games full of crazy motion, wild colors, and fast-paced action sequences.  The N64 took a different approach.  The graphics were a bit blocky, but not nearly as "over-the-top" as Sony's.  Games like Mario, Zelda, Goldeneye, and Perfect Dark didn't have the sharp clarity of characters, but they looked much more "grounded", or realistic.  It just comes down to what looked better to you.  Games: This is where the N64 had a huge advantage over the Playstation.  Mario '64, Mario Kart, both Zelda games, Goldeneye, and a few other "also mentions" (DK, Perfect Dark, etc.) all had huge fan bases that Sony just could not satiate.  The console wars hadn't quite devolved into "who has the best first-person shooter" yet, so gamers were still interested in adventure and racing contests.  Whereas Nintendo had all those classics, Sony's "hero" was Crash Bandicoot.  Yep.  Thus, although the N64 might take a lot of flak these days, I just wanted to set the record straight that, in its day, it was still a quality system that competed tooth-and-nail with the original Playstation due to its grounded graphics and franchise games.	1
Ok the graphics are outdated but who cares when it is home to one of the best games ever made...Zelda 64! That's right and many other hits as well. I have to admit I mainly bought this system because of the Zelda games but behold there are other great hits as well! I don't know what they are, but who cares! Who cares when you have a master peice to keep you entertained for a fairly cheap price!	1
The N64 for me represents the golden age of gaming. Back when this console came out nearly every title released for it was a genuinely unique and fun game experience. The video games that were released on this console have very probably the single greatest range of different game systems you will ever encounter. There are dozens of distinct and unique platformers ranging from Super Mario 64 to Rayman 64, some of the most beloved action and adventure games including The Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, and most people's first foray into first person shooters with Golden Eye and Perfect Dark.  There are hundred of games available for this console and most of them can be found on Amazon.com for under $10! It's a great buy for any retro/classic gamers.	1
I love it.  I get to play all my old games.  I even have my granddaughter playing Donkey Kong, which she loves and she's only 4 years old.  I am so glad I kept my games and got this system.  The only problem I had was that the controller that came with it didn't work very well, so I brought anothher one, and we've been playing ever since.	1
When I ordered my N64 it was listed as newly refurbished in excellent condition with 1 Controller and 1 Game.  When I finally got home I opened the box to find a faded scratched up N64 with the original out dated jumper pack and a dirty completely worn out Controller with the Analog Stick nearly fallen off.  I also got the game without the manual in Excellent condition otherwise, but it was a title nobody has ever heard of.  I installed the unit to my TV and it turned on with visable shaking screen, but I was put off by the poor condition of the product and have decided not to use it in my living room.  I got what I paid for, but the item was NOT in excellent condition.	-1
Best Console of its time.  Great games.  Great times.  I will never get rid of this console again.	1
If you like to play "old games", then you need this system.  Has some of the best games ever created on it.  If you think that you won't have fun with such an old consol, think again.  I have one right next to my Xbox 360 and I play it just as much.	1
This was my first system and I had great fun with it. Some of the games are amazing like Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. This system holds some of the most classic and most well made games. The system itself is alright. I have run into minor problems with it like games freezing or not even loading. The controls are alright, you rarely use the d-pad.	1
this is my system of all time. It has great games like 007,turok,star wars, and more! So buy it.	1
This is the best console you can get becides gamecube of course but if you do not use it all of the time like me get because the racing game are great for games I like San Francisco Rush, San Francisco Rush 2049 and California Speed.	1
I picked this system up a couple of days ago, expansion pack included, for 20 dollars. I also bought Turok Seeds of Evil and Perfect dark for under $10. I also recently bought a couple of other vintage systems, so you can say I enjoy the old games. While I have stated in other reviews that I will get a "next gen" sytem soon, I'm still enjoying the "oldies" While this system may be "outdated" by today's standards, don't be so quick to rule the N64 out. The graphics and sound for it's time are not bad, and the controller fits well in my hand. Not a bad deal at all.	1
Nintendo has to be one of the best systems ever and its all because of the games and the controller. There are quite a few classic games for it(platformers like Super Mario 64,racers like F Zero X,flight simulators like Star Fox 64,puzzle games like Tetris and Dr. Mario 64,shooters like Doom 64 and role playing games like Ocarina Of Time. Call me crazy but I still think that this system has great graphics even by todays standards. They may not be as stylish and pretty as X Box's or Game Cube's but they just look cool. And the controller rocks. Its the perfect length and doesnt even get tangled up and it feels great in the hands. And its worth it to buy it if you're a die hard Mario fan,a die hard Zelda fan or even a die hard F Zero fan like me.	1
I love 64, I thought it was the best console when it came out in 1995. I still play it, even though I've got PS2. Has anyone ever played Conker's Bad Fur Day? It rocks on this console.	1
This system had such a great variety of game...hell it almost beat PSX...N64 put simply...is A CLASSIC!!!! It came out with some of the most well respected games ever...Classics....Lets take a look at them... EXCLUSIVE N64 GAMES... Mario64 Legend of Zelda:Ocarina of Time Conker's Bad Fur Day Paper Mario Mario Party Doom 64 F Zero Perfect Dark Turok Turok 2 Turok 3 Turok Wage wars A few Mortal Combat games.... Duke Nukem:Zero Hour Legend of Zelda: Majoras Mask Other Mario Pary games... Super Smash Bros. Duke Nukem 64.. And more I think.... N64 lasted very well....It had a great long journey of games....Never will this system be forgoten...But this system ain't No Dreamcast I can tell ya that but then again this system came out a few years before Dreamcast.. Now If you're looking for the main N64 titles then I recommend.. Conker's Bad fur day Perfect Dark Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time Paper Mario... F zero Super Smash Bros. If anyone is thinking of getting an N64 GET IT!  It has a great variety of games which got great Reviews....Conkers BFD got a 9.9 from IGN....Which is one of the most well Respected game site....Perfect Dark got a 9.9 from Gamespot which is hard to earn a good rank and Ocarina of time Scored a 10 out of 10 from numerous Game magazines and game sites...so Don't hold back on this system if you're thinking about getting one. But truly if you want the Greatest System ever then look for Dreamcast...which came out with some of the most unique games I've ever played.... N64 is a classic that will never be forgoten and if you love Nintendo then GET THIS SYSTEM!!!! Long live N64......... Later...	1
Nintendo64 may now be considered an outdated gaming system, but in my mind it will always be the best. Nintendo64 was the first system to introduce the joystick to the controller and has one of (if not the) best controllers ever made. This is the system that started the legacy of the James Bond games with Goldeneye, continued and enhanced some of it's Super Nintendo games such as Starfox and Mario Kart. This also brought such great strategy games as Starcraft and Command and Conquer to game console. It also made the legendary Legend of Zelda games superior even for modern times. It has made some of the best racing and sports games that never seise to entertain.  -In short- Nintendo64 is worth buying and I would even consider it over PS2 or XBoX	1
It is always a pleasure, especially in current era of 3D shoot'em up games, when a new adventure game in "old style" [2D, point-and-click interface] emerges. It is even better pleasure if it is a good adventure game. And Nightlong by Team 17 definitely belongs to this category. Your hero is named Joshua Reeve, he lives in 2099 and the game starts when he waits for a beautiful car, gets in it and goes through streets with old friend Hugh Martenson who is a governor of the Union city and currently faces some troubles. He became a target of terroristic attacks and asks Joshua for a help because he saved his life in the past and this is an opportunity for Joshua to do the same in return ... Nightlong comes on three CD full of perfect graphics, animations and music, the puzzles are on the right level of difficulty and the story pulls you in the game immediately from the beginning. If you are a fan of good adventure games, you will not regret the money you spend for buying it. I only hope that Nightlong is not the last adventure game from Team 17.	1
If you like point and click adventure games, this is good buy for the price.  Nice graphics and smooth gameplay.	1
I like adventure games, but I like them to follow some sort of logical  puzzle solving, so dyou can kind of get inside the mind of the creators,  figure out how they think and figure the game out that way. These puzzles  are completely illogical, obviously designed to be frustrating, and keep  you trying different senseless things to proceed in the game.  Also,  although the 2D backgrounds were interesting at times, calling this a 3d  game is quite a stretch by any definition. Even the 3d cut-scenes were  crappy, and the graphics during regular gameplay were just terrible.  Supposedly the game made "game of the year" in Europe, they must  be pretty hard up over there, now I know not to take that as a  commendation.	-1
I have had a N64 since early 1997. From that time until late 2001, I had purchased over 30 games. This system has served me well. In late 2001, I bought a Playstation 2, but it's nothing like what the N64 (was) to me. I would spend hours a day playing Banjo-Kazooie, Super Mario 64, Goldeneye, and others. And the games actully lasted long amounts of time. Sure, they didn't have as good cinamatics as the PS1 versions did, but they lasted long! For example, I beat Banjo-Kazooie in a course of a year and a half. Then I beat Spyro the Dragon in 3 weeks. See my point? So, even though I now have a PS2, it'll never, ever be anything like the N64, and even though they now have all these great new systems, N64 will always be the greatest.	1
Nintendo 64 - the name strikes fear in some people who are thinking of buying a good quality system.  Let me begin by saying that N64 is not bad at all... N64 has a much better processor because it has 64-bits of power (PSX only has 32), 3 times faster than PSX, 4MB ram but with Expansion Pack it goes up to 8MB of ram (PSX only has 2MB ram) and features a higher resolution than the PSX.  This is how the N64 is more powerful than the PSX.  This is not to say that PSX is a bad system.  One downfall to N64 is that it runs on cartridges.  The N64 cartridges may store a lot more than all the other cartridge-based systems but it holds less than a CD and DVD.  It can hold a max of 500MB while the PSX can hold up to 700MB.  This is the weakest point of the N64.  However, with more system ram, it can improve the already good graphics and make a game longer.  Another thing is that most PSX owners will say that N64 can't have FMV (Full motion videos) in the games.  This is NOT ture.  If you own Resident Evil 2, then you will know  what I am talking about.  The only problem is that the FMV is a little less clear.  Since N64 runs on cartridges, it takes longer for developers to make.  So there are only around 300 N64 games while there are around 600 PSX games.  But with rare on Nintendo's side, who needs as many games.  All in all, Nintendo 64 is the best system (besides GAMECUBE, PS2 and X-Box)... It beats PSX to the ground on everything except the Game format.  If N64 were on CD's, PSX would have died a long time ago.	1
I will admit it i reserved the nintendo 64 months in advance. Sure when i got it i thought it was great, but after months of defending it against my classmates and their playstations, i decided to get my own. It by far surpasssed the n64's enjoyment. Sure the n64 has better graphics, but playstation was the better games and better sound. In my opinion nintendo aims their games for a much younger audience. Many of their games are not apealing to the 14+ crowd. Playstation provides way more games for this age group, along with games for the younger group, but they can still be injoyable for the older gamers. The playstaion controler is much better in design. The dual shock controller is the best that i have seen, but who wants to put that bulky heavy rumble pack in the back of the n64 controller? I hate the memory pack for n64, one season on qb club fills the whole thing, theres 20 bucks gone for a game that costs 60 in the first place. That brings me to another point, games are alot cheaper pn playstation, you are looking at a 20 dollar diference. If you are deciding between a playstation or a n64 i would go with the playstation. If you are buying a system for a younger gamer then i would consider the n64.	-1
At the time I bought my Nintendo 64, it was for one reason and one reason only, "Goldeneye 007."  The game was revolutionary when it came out, and took EVERYONE'S breath with the graphics and gameplay.  Other N64 games have evolved into my favorites, such as: "Perfect Dark," "Madden 2001," and "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time." The N64 is a lot more graphically capable than the Playstation.  The downfall for the Nintendo 64 however, which eventually let Playstation surpass it, was Nintendo's decision to go with the cartridge format, which scared game developers away due to the cart's limited memory capacity. Overall, the N64 is home to some of the greatest video games ever made, and is worth your money.	1
This bundle was originall ONLY offered in japan (at toys r us of course) but now even as gamecube and gameboy advance are on the way there is still reason to buy this set. Zelda has been put out on gold colored carts and this set features the n64 zelda's  gold color. i'm buying it for this reason and because there WON'T be another gold zelda cart for a home system EVER EVER AGAIN . That's why this set's a must have set for me! zelda forever!!(2 controlers are a real plus systems usually only have 1 in the box leaving u to buy extra pads yourself)	1
Nintendo 64 is one of the coolest toys I have ever gotten. I love it! It's so fun, and you can get controllers with different colors. Another thing I like about Nintendo 64 is the fact that there is very wide variety of games. Some of the best games are Mario Party 2, Top Gear Rally 2, All Star Baseball 2001, and Mario Kart 64. I also like it because it has different types of games, like action, racing, sports, puzzles, adventure and more! I absolutely like Nintendo 64. I would recommend to anyone who wants a cool video game console!	1
Well, I had the choice of buying this or Starlancer. The graphics in Starlancer looked better, the box was better, it looked more impressive, but one thing made me buy Tachyon....the DON.  I will just say this now,  Bruce Campbell is such a dude. Army of Darkness has the funniest lines in  any film ever, and I didn't want to miss out on any other potential  classics, I got a very decent game into the bargain as well.  Less linear,  which I prefer, this game has such a great sense of humour and depth to it  which could so easily almost be overlooked. For example, a little fact that  would be overlooked I'm sure, every single news bulletin has it's own  specific pictures or animation, and considering the amount of news  bulletins throughout the game this just goes to show Novalogic weren't  slacking.  I can see how some people would criticize it, calling it  mediocre, because of it's old look and feel. However, in my opinion, older  games are the best, and I'm so glad that Novalogic have gone back to basics  almost, swapping revolution for a great gaming experience.  Bruce Campbell  doesn't disappoint as Jake Logan, and the whole game is very tight. It also  has one of the best manuals ever. Buy, enjoy, also buy Army of Darkness. I  love that film.	1
Good game, however I do have a problem.  If you have a Vodoo sound card you might get a whole lot of echo in your speakers.	1
I've been playing outer space combat sims since the original X-Wing came out in 1993.  Tachyon is just as fun and I must say the graphics are WAY better! ;)  I'm using a GeForce2 on a PIII 500 with the game's graphics settings maxed out.  It runs perfectly.  It's an older game but I could never run it cause I didn't have a nice enuf system.  It reminds me a lot of Privateer 2 but I think it's better.  Definitely check this one out.  Can't beat the price and you get MORE than what you pay for this game!!	1
First of all, this review is ASSUMING THAT THE GAME WORKS ON YOUR COMPUTER. I read some of the other reviews below and heard about how this game isn't compatible with some graphics cards or whatever. If that were the case, I'd haved to give this game one star. But since this game did run perfectly well on my machine, here's what I have to say about it. The only space sim that I've played other than Tachyon is X-Wing--an old VGA game--but in many ways X-Wing was the turning point in space sims. The graphics in Tachyon are really good, if somewhat redundant. What I mean is that sometimes I see the same patterns and textures on space stations. Speaking of space stations, I was MOST IMPRESSED by their SIZE. The people at Novalogic really did an outstanding job at scaling things correctly. But what really got me to buy this game was the fact that you could buy different ships and decide what armament and upgrades you want to put on it. Certain ships have a certain amount of slots, and the possible combinations are nearly endless. Another nice feature is that you can own multiple ships at once, or sell individual ships or parts for money. You can hire wingmen to assist you on missions. Since there is no in-flight camera, it's hard to tell if your wingmen did anything to help you, but at least they don't die easily--even the poorer pilots. There are several external view, but I didn't find them very helpful. They should have put a gunsight on the external view so that you could fly through the mission, accomplish it, and enjoy the scenery at the same time. The game is sorta nonlinear. You get to choose which level mission you want to undertake, but ultimately you will end up doing the others. The missions are fairly simple and varied, which is nice. I remember that X-Wing was downright frustrating at times. By the way, there are cheats for this game, so if you get stuck, look 'em up. The levels with the fog are interesting, although they can be a strain on the eyes and disorientating at times. But that's not until the end. There are some cut-scenes, but nothing truly original or amazing--they're still the in-game graphics. This game could have been better, but overall I'd say it's worth its price. But I'd check to make sure it can run on your machine, first.	1
Well, I'm not going to go in and restate everything from all the other reviews on here, I'm just interjecting my 2 cents.  The Multiplayer system is great, the base wars battles are wonderful, everything is great, except one little thing that just bugs the heck out of me.  Remember if you will (or just pretend if you never played the game) Wing Commander 3.  One ship, the Arrow, a light interceptor, had an ability called the Slide which enhanced it's dogfighting abilities.  Well, EVERY ship in this game can do that.  There's more though... There is a ship add-on called lateral thrusters in the game, which allow youer ship to strafe side to side.  Basically, with both of these aspects being redilly available to every ship in the multiplayer campaigns you have 'dogfights' turning into odd forays which much resemble 'circle strafing' matches in any number of First Person Shooter style games.  To me it takes alot of fun out of a flight sim to not be able to dogfight, but that's just my opinion...	1
This game is a lot of fun and the graphics ar top notch to me. True, they are not "Freespace 2" level quality (I don't know of any other game that is) but they work just fine. The ability to choose different story paths adds greatly to the games replay value. Campbell's wisecracks are great. By The Way:  I have a Soundblaster live sound card, a Voodoo 3 card and the game ran fine with absolutely no problems. Update your drivers people!.	1
Wing Commander: Prophecy is without a doubt one of my all-time personal favorite games for the PC. Aside from the fact that it gracefully and heroically retires Christopher Blair (Mark Hammil) from the series, the  game is an expertly crafted piece of entertaining with only a few  (stylistic) flaws. It also improves greatly over Wing Commander IV: The  Price of Freedom by making combat missions longer than the video cut  scenes, something that dogged its predecessor greatly. Prophecy has such  eerie underpinnings that work together with the game and live action  cinematics to make for an awesome story. It is also the start of a new  generation.  After the defeat of the Kilrathi by Blair in Wing  Commander III: Heart of the Tiger, the Confederation finally has peace with  regards to their once feline adversaries and the Cult of Sivar. But there  in lies the crux of the matter for an ages old Kilrathi prophecy points to  a time when darkness will descend upon the universe and the Kilrathi will  die, bathed in their own blood and their once mighty claws no match for the  coming evil, a time that they call Kn'Thrak, (A translation that means  either `darkness' or `evil'). And it all begins with the destruction of a  Confederation survey ship analyzing the destroyed Kilrathi homeworld in the  Kilrah System by an unknown race. There Shall Come A time When one who  has the heart of a Kilrathi, but is not Kilrathi born, shall  rain cleansing fire down upon us, and Kn'Thrak, a time of great  darkness, shall embrace us.  We are then taken to the TCS Midway, a  gargantuan super carrier that will be the focus of the game and your home  base for the duration. It is truly a magnificent ship and about the same  size as Darth Vader's Super Star Destroyer-about 8,000 meters in length. It  acts as a mobile base for the Terran Confederation and designed to be the  center piece of a larger armada. It is here that we meet Lance Casey-your  character-who is fresh from the academy and son of a famous TCN pilot. We  also meet up with old Wing Commander alumnus-Maniac (Tom Wilson) who takes  every opportunity to belittle Casey until getting his comeuppance in the  worst way and by numerous members of the Midway's crew.  Basically  it's your job to figure out just who these new aliens are and what they  want. What they apparently want is to slaughter everyone and everything  they come across, which is great because that's why you're here! There are  heaps of missions here and they are all a great deal of fun. Missions range  from standard Combat Air Patrols (CAPs), to seeking out and destroying  capital ships, taking down freighters and search and rescue missions. One  of the most memorable moments of the game is a missile launch, especially  the Swarms, which leave twisting contrails as they streak off towards their  targets. Origin really did a fine job on the new fighter designs-they no  longer have the blocky, slab-like look that Price of Freedom had, but  instead have a more graceful, rounded look. Most of these ships are also a  joy to fly, conveying a great sense of speed and maneuverability, though  less so with bombers like the Devastator.  Sid Mead (of 2010 &  Blade Runner fame) was hired on to design the alien Nephilim/Phylum  fighters and capital ships, and produces true wonders! The fighters have a  beautiful aquatic-insectile look to them while the capital class starships  resemble nothing most people have ever seen. They are both fearsome and  invoke no small amount of curiosity from the player and made me want to  find out more about this dark and enigmatic race.  Mission designs  seems to have been a priority at Origin, because they are expertly crafted  and bear much resemblance to Freespace 2, and lack the time-sensitive  nature that plagued many of the X-Wing & TIE Fighter missions from  LucasArts. I also retract my title comment in my Freespace 2 review-Wing  Commander: Prophecy is as good a game. The missions take priority over the  cut scenes, the post flight ones become annoyingly repetitive, as there are  only 2 or 3 to see and you see them often. Beyond that this is Origin's  swan song as there doesn't seem to be any movement from them to sequel it  beyond Secret Ops which only adds new missions, good as they are. This is a  fantastic game-it both looks and plays great while possessing a solid and  engrossing story. Superb!	1
Yet another in the turgid 'Wing Commander' series, 'Prophecy'thankfully reduces the amount of dull, plotless FMV, whilst notsignificantly improving the gameplay, which doesn't seem to have evolved very much since the original 'Wing Commander'. Your ship still doesn't 'feel' as if it is flying through space, the supposedly-invincible bad guys are more of a nuisance than a threat, and if you fail a mission it will probably be because you failed to protect something that you were not told about. Imagine watching a bad, low-budget science fiction film whilst playing a modern homage to 'Star Raiders' and you have the game in a nutshell. END	-1
I randomly thought of this game, and when I wanted to buy it, I came here. It was well-priced, and I enjoyed playing this game.	1
Years ago, when this first came out I was hooked.  Forming a online clan, we called our selves "sithlords".  We were fully committed to having fun.  Whats great about this game was the balance across the classes.  I loved it.  The story of the game was amazing as well.  Now I have no idea if the servers are still up for online fun but it was truely nice at one point in time.  Great pick.	1
The interface is super well done.  Made enjoying the game easy.  It was for me a real surprise how well it was done.  It did not recieve all the hype many games get yet it is as good as any other I played (i.e. Diablo, ...) and unique in many ways.  As in all RPGs there is a spot or two where the play gets a bit teadious but this game had much less of this than others.  Each of the three character types requires a truely different style of play.  One aggressive (hack and slash with weapons and armor emphasis), one moderate (magic bent with spells and charms emphasis), and one defensive (summoner idiom with "let your friends do the killing while you try and stay out of the way" emphasis).  Each requires different actions and thinking strategy, and each is just as fun as the others, just different; which means there is good replayability even if you don't go online for a fight.  This game is growing harder to get these days so if you have an interest act now. Hail Flavius	1
Nox is a fun little game.  What it lacks in originality, it more than makes up for with excellent gameplay and performance.  Considering how low the price is for this game now, it is definitely worth buying. The storyline for this game is linear, but each of the levels are large and have a lot of areas to explore.  The theme of the game is kind of light-hearted and cartoonish.  You walk around the levels, hacking or shooting or zapping monsters, finding keys, and breaking open stuff for goodies.  In between levels, you can usually visit merchants to buy new stuff and get your equipment repaired. There's nothing really original there.  Where Nox excels is in some other areas in which other games often fail: 1.  The graphics, animation, and sound for this game are excellent.  Each room has a bunch of small objects to interact with, although most of them are things that you don't need.  Still, if you want to, you can smash wine barrels for the heck of it and push rocks around. 2.  The interface is easy to use and fits the fast-paced gameplay very well.  There are hotkeys for three potions, five spells, and two weapons.  3.  The game is short, but it is genuinely replayable.  At the beginning of the game, you choose one of three distinct character classes.  The beginning missions for each class are totally different.  The later missions are the same, but each class has such distinct abilities that you have to play them somewhat differently.  4.  The inventory system was refreshingly un-tedious.  Maybe it's not realistic, but it's a nice break from the routine of constantly rearranging your inventory.  5.  The game actually has good gold balance.  What I mean by this is that you don't end up the game with a ton of gold and nothing good to spend it on.  You get progressively more useful items at each level, but they cost more.  Each time you spend gold, you can usually buy one or two things that you want, but you have to spend your money wisely. NOX is a fun game to play.  Its short length and shallow, linear plot are the reason that it gets four stars instead of five.	1
While sitting in his trailer in a Florida trailer park, Jack Mower (along with his TV!) is suddenly sucked through a vortex into the quasi-medieval world of Nox.  There he finds he's the only person who can rid that world of the evil and malevolent sorceress, Hecubah, and he can't go home until he does.  He can choose to follow the path of the warrior, conjurer or wizard, each with its own attributes, skills and challenges.  Your character is always male, but if you have something against the name Jack, you can change it, along with other physical attributes. I started out as a warrior, because that's usually the easiest character to play in these adventure/RPG hybrid games, since you have plenty of brawn to hack and slash your way through the foes, while toting about practically everything you come across.  It soon became apparent that enough money to enable purchase of the really cool stuff is hard to come by, especially if you want to keep your weapons and armour in good shape.  Even if you tote about all you can carry, it doesn't raise much when you get to a shop.  Also, one of the areas is practically impossible to negotiate without ranged weapons, which are prohibitively expensive, and you don't find many on corpses or in chests.  The warrior has no magic skills at all and is dependent on food and potions for healing and curing.  You can only carry a limited amount at once and you always seem to run out at critical moments. I left my warrior in the castle and started out again as a conjurer, as I'd read in some reviews that this is the most diverse and interesting character to play.  Well, I haven't played as a wizard, and probably won't, but playing the conjurer is great fun.  You visit the same places, but have quite different challenges and meet different people.  A conjurer can use bows, crossbows and staves, can wear leather armour (some you find in the latter stages are pretty cool) and has heaps of offensive, defensive and healing magic at his disposal.  The most interesting spell enables you to charm animals to assist you and later you can even summon them to help.  Your great mid-game foe, the mimic, is a worthy ally when summoned, especially against the vampire lichs.  In one of Nox's great ironies, monsters in the conjurer game drop heaps of ranged weapons that a warrior would kill for, but which are useless to the conjurer and raise hardly any cash.  I'd advise not to buy arrows, as you find more than enough in the latter stages and you can use the cash for better purposes.  And carry a few spare sets of armour into the final chapter, as you'll go through it quickly and any armour is better than none. Nox has often been compared with Diablo, and while I can see why that comparison can be drawn, I would liken it more to Revenant.  Like Revenant, it has a good story line, very impressive graphics, and a very simple control system.  But it leaves both Diablo and Revenant floundering in its wake, since it has a pleasing amount of gameplay, acceptable voice acting, challenging (but not impossible) puzzles, and a satisfactory ending.  I wasn't having much success in the final showdown, so I restored and tried a different approach (always take note of your latest find - it's often a clue to defeating your next foe).  That time Hecubah could not withstand the concerted attack, and after a great little final cut scene, Jack (and the TV) were restored to Earth. I'd read that Nox is very fast, and boy, was that an understatement.  Battles in this game, particularly in the latter stages, needs amazing reflexes, something I'm not overly endowed with.  However, I am blessed with cunning and persistence, and after my character died three or four (or even ten) times, I'd managed to figure out the puzzle, or a good strategy against the monster(s).  Some of the later monsters move with lightning speed, often only needing one hit to splatter Jack and his gear all over the screen, so a well-positioned charmed or summoned ally makes an excellent distraction, allowing Jack the nanosecond needed to get off a good shot or spell (I didn't have much success with bombs). I loved Nox, but since I've revised my personal scoring system, I can only give it 4 stars.  I'm saving 5 for that really unforgettable game, and although Nox was great fun, it really was too similar to Diablo and Revenant to outscore them.	1
I'm a huge fan of RP games, and review a ton of them...  Atfirst glance, this game seems like a rip-off of many other games outthere. Diablo or Baldur's Gate, anyone? What original ideas. You can be a warrior, conjurer or wizard. You come from Earth, you're sent into another dimension where you are the Only Hope. Even worse, you're a male from a Florida trailer park whose idea of fun is crushing beer cans against his forehead while rebuilding truck engines. Let's talk about the anti-good-gaming ideal. However, when you start up the game, the graphics amaze you. The whole sparkling mouse, the smooth graphics on all the select screens, and then the game play graphics. Simply amazing. Barrels are not just background decoration, they are all discreet individual objects.  Rocks, skulls, you name it - all individual objects that can be moved around. The enemies all have personalities. The three factions all have distinct reasons for existing, and are in conflict with each other. The comments are humorous and the individuals have personality. I suppose at times the coders can overcome even the most inane marketers when it comes to game design. The spells are great!  The conjurer, my favorite character type, has a Pixie Swarm to help defend him, and can have various creatures hang out with him as sort of a roving company of friends. I like the wolves and spiders myself, but you can acquire just about any enemy out there to hang out with you and help protect you. The training levels are easy to get the hang of. I dislike the cone-of-vision, because even if you were just in a room, you suddenly forget where everything is in it - even the walls - and have to visit again to make sure you didn't miss anything. If you swing by a room, it draws it as a complete room, so it's difficult to tell from maps where you have been and where you have just passed by. Also, save games are limited and you can't describe them at all. They simply list the character name and actual time - making it quite difficult for a multi-gamer household like mine to keep characters separated! There are other minor bugs - icons don't consistantly draw in, and multi-player bugs are slightly annoying. The game itself is WAY too short when played in single player mode. Multi-player gets old really quickly, as you run around trying to kill each other over and over again. How about cooperative quests, like in BG? In general though, the graphics and gameplay on this game are quite better than I had expected from a game that touted male-only characters. If only they had put a bit of effort into thinking about the people playing this game, and what they would want to play! I would have rated this game extremely highly, instead of only reasonably high. Worth renting to play through, but not a keeper.	1
I would characterize this surprisingly playable game as the first person shooter (yes, meaning the UT, Q3 genre). In juxtaposition against the original Diablo, Nox has a lot fuller content and a more coherent story line consistent with a role-playing type game.  Though I would admitt that the story, while just fine, is not awe-inspiring like Torment. In juxtaposition against Baldur's Gate, Nox is a lot more fast pace, requiring infinitely more mouseclicks and less thought in combat.  Agility of fingers--not strategy--rules the day here.  In that respect the game is similar to Diablo, but with the added dimension of more player movement option like jumping (ie a first person shooter). In multiplayer the game gives you UTisque options like...uhu...capture the flag?  That is a very creative concept for a game like this and it adds to the replayability. The graphics and sound are very good but certainly not revolutionary.  The bottomline, though, is that Nox is extremely fun to play.  In the end, isn't that the ultimate purpose of a game?	1
Delta Force 1 was a great new addition in the first-person-shooter genre.  The experience of fighting outdoors, being able to see hundreds of feet away, ducking behind bushes, hiding out on a hilltop and sniping people far  away from you ... it's one of the best online experiences I've ever had.  Now we have Delta Force 2 ... and nothing much has changed.  Some new  weapons, new maps, and new single player missions.  Unfortunately, the  graphics are more demanding, causing slowdowns on many machines.  If you  have a 32-bit 3D card, you're lucky - those are the only ones the game  accepts as of now. All in all, this is still a great game with the best  online action around - I recommend it!	1
I bought this game at a fairly low price, and when I started playing, I was totally amazed - at the incredibly bad graphics.   The game featured a basic HUD with two annoyingly large bars, placed above and below it. That was the first thing I noticed. Next I saw that the terrain was sort of fuzzy, and my gun wasn't all that impressive either.   "OK...," I said to myself. "Why don't I try walking around and see if this gets any better?" So I did. Guess what? No gun sway! Every stinkin FPS game I've every seen had some sort of movement with the gun (Ok, maybe not Wolfenstein 3d, but still!).   So, anyway, I tried firing the gun - barely any recoil at all. I tried a pistol just to see if the hammer would pull back but it did not.   Anywayz terrible graphics = boring game. Enough said	-1
The first of these games are the single player campaign missions which while fun ranger from easy to really really easy.  The enemy A.I is at its best lackluster and at worse totally moronic.  To tell you truth I never bothered much with the single player missions. The 2nd game which totally kicks butt and gets you your money's worth is the multplayer part.  Anyone who is a fan of Red Faction or Halflife will love this game. On-line it is a total slaughter-fest even though the community has shrank n recent years as people have gone on to either the DF sequals or something else simply to combat the rise in cheating.  The other versions of the game did a much better of keeping the cheaters out. Overall-Still all in all I just love this game	1
Okay. Some people (Like 10 and 12 year olds) think this game is sooo cool. This game so very unrealitic. Infact, everything about this game is stupid. The weapons are okay, but when you fire, there is no recoil that makes you reticule (The cross thingy that helps you aim) go up and down. Also, 1 shot from any gun kills an enemy (Which is pathetic) so why put your M4A1 rifle on burst? Just use single shot to conserve ammo. The games graffics are as [bad] and the screams that the enemies make when you shoot them are corny and cartoony. I suggest that you do not buy this game because of the reasons listed above. Please, save your money and buy a better game like Counter-Strike (The best game ever made) Half-Life (The second best) or Rainbow Six: Raven Shield (The third best) If you are looking for realism, DO NOT look here at this game. Its pathetic.	-1
Get it through your head THIS GAME stinks First of all the graphics suck,boring gameplay(I usually like realistic military games), coudn't acess campaign, takes forever to install. I would give this game 0 stars. I just bought it about 1 hour ago played it for 15 min. and then got bored... Try the Unreal series , half life or rainbow 6	-1
I have gone backwards in my delta force experience having bought DF#-landwarrior first and then buying up the first two just to have more missions to play. It is certainly been worth it! All the delta force games take place out doors which makes them different. It's realistic action were you have to snipe your way around the perimeter to make your way into a camp to complete your mission objective. Of the three delta force games i own i think df2 has the most original and interesting missions. You like missions? Well in this game you get over 40 of them! I wish rainbow six would give you that many. These missions are part of two campaigns that form a certain story line or you can play them as "quick missions" in any order on your own. Many of those missions are also available in multiplayer so you can play coop with a buddy. The missions take place in a variety of weather conditions day and night and the challenge is being able to take out all the terrorists because that one guy you missed will take you out and remember one shot kills! Sure you can respawn but that just means starting the mission all over again from the beginning. That is the challenge in delta force the sheer number of combatants you need to take out and the large area in which they use. For example in one of my favorite missions there is a downed pilot hiding in this snowy wilderness. To fly him out safely you need to take out a camp containing at least 25 of the enemy and destroy three SAMs. Getting most of the terrorist scum is easy as you just take a position up top and start picking them off but it's hard to get them all and some are out where you can't see them easily. So patience is key because as soon as you leave your cover somebody will get you. It took me a while to complete that mission and twice i was 99% finished just having blown up the SAMs only to get sniped. You don't have a huge number of weapons to choose from but what you have is fantastic and you'll find yourself using one of the sniper rifles or the M4 machine gun which has a grenade launcher. You won't use your hand gun much and you have the choice of delayed or frag grenades. Satchels are available for blowing up large things like those SAM sites and you can use extra ammo or a vest as one of your options. Because methodical, longer range warfare is the order you have a really nice alternative to games like rainbow and half life were most of your action is confined to a small space. It's the pace of the game that i really like and it's a blast to pick off some terrorist from 300 meters away. The multiplayer is a whole new ball game because you're going to have quite a few people trying to get you. The last time i played at nova world there were 900 people in there so you never have to wait for some action. You can play deathmatch where every man is for himself or team death match. Capture the flag is a blast. You really can never tire of this game! Drawbacks? Well the graphics are not an improvement over delta force one though they are pretty cool. You do need to update the game all the way because there are a few problems that needed to be fixed and you'll want to maximize your resolution. The game can be just a bit choopy and sluggish at times which brings me to why i only have a 4* rating. In all the delta force games you are placed in an outdoor enviroment that is enormous. Often you will have to run for a minute or two just to engage the enemy or reach their camp. In all these games you feel like you are spending too much time running  around and that is especially a problem in multiplyer were you run for ever only to get killed and have to go back to where you were . DF3-landwarrior remedies this problem a little by making the characters run faster but in this game you seem to plod along at a slow pace. That's especially true when running up and down steep mountains. Over all delta force2 is a fantastic realistic shooter with unique characteristics. It's a great compliment to some of the other great games out there. I own rainbow 6 and rouge spear and this makes a nice alternative. Certainly the price is right. [....]	1
Being an ex soldier, I say that this game is more realistic, than operation flashpoint. #1- in df2 you don't have to shoot like hell in order to kill the enemy,#2 in df2 you are not going to charge in to the enemy like a fool, unless you are ready to commit suicide, you can use air strikes on a tank. I do believe it would be suicide to move in on a tank with satchel charges, if that tank is fully operational. I believe a tank can be laser targeted. So all in all think about it. Operation flashpoint is a good game, but some rough edges need to be smoothen out. Real soldiers would not commit themselves to such danger, and would not be asked to do so.	1
I thought this game was a lot of fun  but very unrealistic in some places, like when I was sniping at an enemy camp and the moment I fired a shot all people in the camp immediately spotted me and start firing at me. And also the red screen when you're getting shot is totally annoying, you can't see anything at all.	1
It seems that most of the people who played this game liked it.  And I must say that when I got it, I was expecting a better experience than I got, something along the lines of Rainbow Six with more running and shooting.  However, as opposed to most of the reviews I saw, Delta Force was a huge dissapointment.  With horrible graphics (Maybe it's my computer, but they didn't even have a strafing animation or realistic grass) and stupid extras as weapons (see the pathetic explosion from a strike) the game was a massive waste of money.  I'm beginning to think that everone likes it because it's so cheap.	-1
Of course, it was a good game, fun, and even addictive.  Some interesting improvements include the more advanced AI of the enemies than was the case in the first "Delta Force".  It's also more realistic than the first one: i.e. hiding inside a canvas tent won't protect you from the cannon fire from a Hind.  Using several parachute sequences made it much more enjoyable and interesting.  A big problem, however, was that when you looked at your GPS map, you could still move you man but you couldn't turn his direction.  This proved to be a major irritation all throughout gameplay.  Furthermore, inclusion of a shotgun was nothing but absurd, unrealistic, and totally unnecessary.  Also, the manual and Help screens are very unclear on how to climb down ladders.  As the heading says, it was good, but by fixing only a few minor details they could have made it a lot better.	1
Finally I found a 3D commando soldier simulation with an interface that can be mastered in 2 minutes without sacrifizing realism. I love it. The graphics, the gameplay, the missions, the controls and different objects,  vehicles, weapons and so on. Four stars seems a little bit cheap for this  great game, but the fifth star is missing because I would have liked to see  a greater variety of campaigns, for example with different  identities/themes. But still it is worth every penny.	1
I've never played a Tomb Raider game until I bought this a month ago and I was really impressed.  The graphics are a bit too blocky and choppy, the controls take a bit of getting used to and Laura doesn't always seem to do what I want her to, but I loved the challenge of it all.  The puzzles have found that right balance of being challenging without making you rip your hair out trying to figure it out.  I've not looked at a cheat book yet and I'm pretty far into the game already.  Granted I don't have all the secrets on each level, but I'll go back and do that later.  The cinemas are done very nicely as well.  The game creates a lot of it's mood by suprising you with baddies popping out when you least expect it.  More than once I've been startled and hit the wrong key just to see Laura die.  But, with a smile on my face, I just start from my last save and have at it again.  And that's another thing you can save at any time you want.  BIG plus. If you're into games at all, you have to give this a try.  I've been pulled into the game completely, but others comments are keeping me away from the sequals.  Buy this, the original, and prepare for an adventure you'll never forget. Tip:  Make sure you know what kind of sound card you have installed on your computer, because you have to tell the game which kind to use.  It took me a few days to figure out which one I had installed.	1
I agree with Michael below.  The original TR is hands down the best in the series.  Each successive TR game, though it may have enjoyed better graphics, sound, cut scenes, etc, also became progressively more difficult  and borderline unplayable.  TRII was fairly strong, although it wasn't as  good as the first.  But III and IV introduced problematic frustrating  levels that sent one running to the internet (or, for the more foolish, to  the nearest store to by the official Eidos hint guide). Gamers need to  realize that glitzy graphics and cool sounds do not add up to a great game.  I recently replayed TR and loved it.  It has atmosphere (who DOESN'T  remember standing way up there on top of the Sphinx's head when the camera  pulls back giving you a perspective on the surroundings?).  It had  originality (who WASN'T surprised when a raptor came out of nowhere in the  Lost Valley?).  Most importantly, however, TR had great puzzles, puzzles  that could be figured out through logic.  You might get stumped, but if you  sat there long enough and stared at the screen, the answer would eventually  occur to you.  And if you were truly at a loss (as I was during the  Cistern), you never got angry when you found out the solution online.  You  never cursed at the game and yelled, "Hey, that's BS!  Who would have  thought of trying that?" Sadly, illogical puzzles plague the  remaining games in the series (especially III and IV).  I'd stick with the  original, the best, Tomb Raider!	1
The original tomb raider, while lacking the visual panache of the third and fourth entries, and the intricate puzzles of all three sequels, is still the best. The reason is simple.  This one is fun!  the puzzles  are not needlessly obtuse, and you don't have to wander endlessly,  backtrack, turn up the brightness, and look in nonsensical places for the  solution to problems you can't even spot right away! the plotline makes  the most sense, and the level layout is far superior with the emphasis on  striking level design rather than puzzles.  Has there been any sequence in  any of the sequels to compare with the waterfall plunge and t-rex entry in  the lost valley?  Or the tower scene in Rome where you battle the rooms of  the gods?  I don't think so.  This is before you needed a hint guide to  find any of the bonuses and you didn't die fifteen hundred times trying to  solve far too many puzzles.	1
"De plane! De plane! It's stuttering! De plane!" First of let me say that you need a computer the size of the Empire state building to run this game. I got a PIII 800 with a GeForce 256 card and a 256 memory and  this game tore it to shreds in a matter of minutes. This made me think  again about upgrading my system. As long as you fly straight it's ok; that  is if you want to fly to the North pole or the South pole everytime you  boot up this game. But once you turn the aircraft, you'll experience  graphics turbulence. You'll feel your computer shudder and shake as it  battles it's way to redraw the scenery. You'll see your frames slow down  really bad. Lower the graphics settings? Try it and you'll just make this  game laugh in your face. Download the patch? Yes, I did and it was still  stuttering. You can make every upgrade you want on your computer but if the  game is the problem then it's a lost cause. If you're thinking about  picking up this game, make sure you have a powerful computer that runs on  nuclear energy. Like most other Microsoft Flight Sims, this one is geared  more towards the gamer side and not so much on the real simulator  enthusiasts. The planes are just too easy to fly. You could ask your kid  brother to do the take-off procedure. Realism is not that all real as the  game boasts itself to be. The game does have its own pluses though like a  huge database of airports, downloadable Jeppesen weather reports, and of  course there's a lot of third party support on this. If you're a gamer who  wants to try flight sims then pick this game up. If you're a simulator ,  then pick up something else like Fly 2K! (very realistic) or Aerowinx  744(very very realistic).	-1
When I bought this game I got cought up in it for a week.  People are complaining that it didn't run good on there system.  Thats because they have a PII processor.  PCGAMER magazine said that if you have anything worse than PIII 450 128mb ram than it won't work good.  That is true it  works grat on a PIII but the game is not optimxed for PII.  I have a PIII  600 128megs of ram and the best graphics board and I installed the 300mb  Compact install and it worked fine. The MSFS2000 Pro edition is worth the  extra buck. The extra aircraft are -Beech King Air- 2 engine turboprop.  -Concorde- Mach 2 SST(Super Sonic Transport). -777 300- 2 engine jet  transport. -Moony Bravo- 1 prop speed craft In this game you can for the  fist time (in 17 years of MSFS) fly from city to city in GPS  mode. Pros-Great game, excellent aircraft. Cons-Need joystick, Bad sys.  requirements Bottom line-Best non military flight sim if you have the  speed.	1
This is the best flight simulator Microsoft has ever produced, there no doubt about that... Excellent graphics, new features such as GPS navigation, more airports worldwide, better weather system, and easier to  use. There is a downside to all this I think the consumer should know. The  speed of the game is NOTICABLY slower compared with MS FlightSim 98 and  below... Very glitchy all-around. I could not seem to speed it up (usually  averages around 20 frames per sec) even with setting the detail settings  lower. To put it in perspective, I have a PII 400mhz computer with 192mb of  ram and a 16mb 3dfx Voodoo 3d accelerator card. I even bought the  accelerator card to see if it would speed it up... it barely does! I am  recommending anyone who wants to buy this program and likes a fast,  non-glitchy game to be aware that if your computer has a processor below  300mhz, you will not like what you see... Microsoft says that you must have  a 166mhz minimum! HA! You wouldn't even be able to fly the graphics would  be so slow. To recap, If you want the game to run smoothly, you should  atleast have a 300mhz PII system with atleast 32mb of ram and I would  recommend getting some kind of video accelerator card (if you don't already  have one, and if your serious about performance).  If you just want to  play and don't really care about the slow speed, go with Microsoft's  recommendation about having a 166mhz processor system or higher. It will be  very slow but will work. Overall, this is a very good game and would  recommend for anyone! Also makes a great gift.	1
I'm a fan of Flight Simulator since Ver. 4.0. Now with these new version flying a plane it`s a reallistic sensation...! You have to try it...! You can do it...! The new planes are excellent and very real in flying  characteristics, weather could be wild with you... I recommend just one  more thing... buy it...!	1
When I was a kid my friends and I played a board game called "Squad Leader." The game focused on individual squads and tactics in WW2. We always wondered what it would be like to be in the game, fighting from  house to house. Hidden and Dangerous has done that and then some! This game  is dangerous from many different perspectives. If you have a significant  other in your life DO NOT BUY THIS GAME because you are headed for a break  up, or divorce court for sure! I hope you drink coffee to stay awake at  work because if you don't you WILL! As one of my fellow reviewers has put  it, time will fly and before you know it the rooster will be singing his  song. If you love the World War 2 era and you have a gaming problem this  one is a God send! The bugs that people mention are the only drawback, but  it has only happened once to me. I believe that the patch should solve it  all. Rainbow Six is an excellent game but H&D is much more interactive.  In H&D you can control each member of your team, and they each have  specific roles. The best is the ability to strip the germans you blast of  their weapons, ammo, and uniforms. Be careful with grenades and explosives  because you will blow your self apart if your not. Bottom line this one  is VERY worth your $$$$$$$! You will thank me for the bags under your eyes!	1
My friend and I have been longing for a game like this for years.  And finally in the Summer of '99, Illusion Softworks, a Czech-based software company, has created such a game.  One of my favorite missions is an  assault on a bunker base defended by a network of trenches and MG34 machine  guns.  Now which movie did that come from?  The final mission is awesome.  Sneak thru an airfield at the end of the war with the Russians attacking on  the other side. Sound effects are great.  Makes you feel like you're  there.  As with the airfield mission, you see anti-aircraft fire snake thru  the sky, just like Baghdad, BABY! Granted the initial release had many,  many bugs.  But with several patches most bugs have been worked out.  Be  sure and get the v1.3 patch which has seemed to fix some problems that v1.2  created. i.e. The M41 Rifle now fires again, but with a 5-round clip which  is historically accurate anyway.  In v1.2 it wanted to reload without ever  shooting.  Soldier AI has been greatly improved on both sides as well.  However, the dead bodies still just hang in mid-air if shot on slanted  terrain.  Mouse sensitivity has been improved also. I'm awaiting the new  Devil's Bridge add-on coming around the end of the month which will take  the campaigns to locales like Greece, Poland and Battle of the Buldge.  This add-on includes 9 new missions across 3 huge campaigns.	1
This is a very smart 'soldier sim' - less anal than 'Rainbow Six' but much stricter than 'Delta Force'. You guide a set of WW2 SAS commandos through a set of superbly-designed, 'Where Eagles Dare'-style missions, whilst being  shot at by extremely accurate Nazi guards. After a short while getting used  to the game controls (your soldiers move around realistically - unlike  other games, they don't glide effortlessly over the ground) you can order  your men around, fight effectively, plant bombs and do all kinds of  commando things. The tension is palpable, the presentation is excellent  (especially the music, performed by a proper orchestra), and the chance to  act out childhood fantasies with a captured MP40 is irresistable. That  said, it could have been a lot better. The initial release was bugged to  blue blazes, and despite a patch, it still feels shaky. The AI makes lots  of odd mistakes, your soldiers are unusually flimsy (particularly on uneven  ground, where they tend to trip and fall and die), and the enemy soldiers  are unfeasibly hyper-accurate from a map-length away. Furthermore, a couple  of the 'end-of-episode' missions are ferociously, unfairly tough, and  you'll probably cheat out of frustration. Still, when it works, it's one  of the best games around - combining lots of tense sneaking with moments of  violent action and excellent, varied mission designs.	1
I'm usually not crazy about real-time strategy games, as they tend to become real "click-fests" where speed is more important than actual strategy.  This one, however, has kept me interested for a few weeks  now. The technology tree is very important, as research will allow you to  create more powerful units and new buildings.  Gather resources (wood,  stone, gold, food) to build, research, expand and conquer.  The  civilizations are just different enough to keep things interesting.  Graphics and sounds are great and the scenarios are challenging.  Online  play, either competitive or cooperative, is fun.  All in all, this is a  great game with enough depth to keep Civilization fans interested.	1
love this game	1
Excellent!	1
Age of Empires is, along with other games, an icon and a mandatory reference of the shining game industry of the 90's. This kind of games are missed a lot. Marketing and graphics have taken over good stories and gameplay.  I hope we can live another generation like that one.	1
Most games are hot when they release and then quickly become old and dated. Age of Empires II - The Age of Kings stands the test of time. This is a game that is fun even years after its release.  You would think a game created in 1999 would seem blocky and old after only a year or two. Quite the contrary. The gameplay, immersion in detail, and strategic fun in Age of Empires II makes it into a game that I envision will be playable and fun for years to come.  The game takes you through a variety of situations. You need to be an efficient hunter-gatherer. You have to know how to manage naval warfare. It's a great test of your ability to think outside the box, as you investigate and manage a new set of challenges with every pass.  I adore history, so it was a treat to be in a scenario with William Wallace and Joan of Arc. You see the real life locations they had to fight through, and you save the day with your own activities. The locations span the globe, keeping things interesting.  I realize that some people aren't interested in multiplayer and certainly there is enough here in the game to keep a solo player happy. However, those who do love multiplayer will be in for a treat. The game does an excellent job of keeping all sides engaged in the battle. I happen to love the multiplayer aspect here.  Yes, the graphics aren't super high def and up to current standards. That is quite all right by me. The gameplay itself is well done, and really after a few minutes I don't even notice what the details of the various structures look like. I am too busy racing around the screen planning my defenses. As long as the on screen icons are easy to identify and work with, that's all that matters to me.  Are there any downsides? I imagine gamers who are most focused on first person shooters, who want to aim rifles at heads and shoot, probably won't be as keen on the strategy based, long term planning involved here. That is quite fine. There are different types of games for different players. For strategy fans, Age of Empires II is quite a treat.  We purchased Age of Empires II with our own funds.	1
Age Of Empires 2 is a masterpiece. Regardless of any complaints anyone has made about this game, there is no arguing. This one of the most fun, addictive, and satisfying games ever made.  You can play it for months. I played it for over a year, then came back and played it for another year. It's probably the most addictive game I've ever played. Not Mario, not Zelda, not the great Doom, not Quake or Half-life or Warcraft or even Grand Theft Auto has ever had me as hooked as this game. Microsoft and Ensemble Studios hit the nail on the head with AOE 2.  The sequel to Age Of Empires keeps everything that made the first one great, throws away almost everything that made it bad, and throws an amazing, revamped user interface that gives the player god-like power if used expertly.  The different civilizations are fantastic. The advantages and disadvantages of each one make the game interesting and balanced, although some civilizations are better (overall) than others. I mean, really, who doesn't love (and equally hate) the Longbowmen? The War Elephants? The Woad Raiders? The Throwing Axeman?  The units are the best part of the game. Except for the paladin and scorpion wipeout trick, the unit balance is superb. The naval battles are amazing, with fireships, ballista ships, and even ships that launch cannonballs.  There are more buildings, tons more upgrades, and a brand-new unit I like to call the x-factor: the trebuchet. This is one of the units that makes AOE 2 a true delight. As built up as a city can become, it can be destroyed in minutes with enough trebuchets.  The multiplayer aspect of this game is what solidifies AOE 2's standing as one of the best games ever made. It is surreal. I've had 12-hour multiplayer sessions many times. You just don't want to stop. It's so fun!!! It's madness!  As far as challenge goes, you'll get all you want. Just try beating the entire game on the hardest difficulty and see the headache you get. And if you get through with that, buy the expansion pack and eat your heart out.  Buy this game! Play it until you're sick of it! That probably won't happen, but even if it does, when you come back from your break you'll be twice as hooked.  Ha!!! The memories I have of this game! Man, this is the best!	1
Similar to the first gam in this series you are here to dominate the territory you are put onto.  Whether or not there is 2 through 8 players(computer or otherwise) is up to the player.  The Computer graphics on this game is far suprior to the previous installment. Well worth the price just for the graphics.  A novel of a game for any age and gamer level.	1
This game is an awesome demonstration of what life was like in the middle ages. The thrill of watching your small village grow into a mighty empire is very cool. The scenerios are historically accurate, fun 2 play, and most importantly, challenging yet possible. a great overall game.	1
You know you're in trouble when the first scenario after the tutorial pits you against three foes. If you've played a RTS before it's not that bad but if you're new to the genre it's the deep end of the pool. True, I'm more of a explore and build player but I was still disappointed with the difficulty of the campaigns. If a game wants to be difficult I'd prefer it be with good AI, not swamping you with an early rush or overwhelming numbers. There is a simple formula to win most scenarios: survive the early rush, create a defense and assault the computer opponents one at a time, and you'll win.  There are good things here, a lot of them. Huge maps and tech tree, updated graphics and well-balanced 'rock-paper-scissors' units. I also think the random scenario generator is great for a couple hours of play.  If you're new to real-time strategy it isn't the place to start. If you want to David vs. Goliath, this game is for you.	1
Age of Empires 2: Age of Kings is interactive game corresponding to the Medevil times when the powerful Roman Empirer Fell, and the world is up for grabs. Microsoft did all out job putting this game together. It has wonderful graphics and it doesn't take much space in your computer. I shouldn't be talking I have an Windows XP but it can prform on even the oldest computers. It has William Wallace, Joan of Arc, Genghis Khan, Saladin, and Barbarossa all historic war leaders of that time, and you can control some of the most powerful civilizations like the Franks the Japanese, Byzantines, Vikings, Mongols, Celts, and more. You can choses your own destiny. You can be a little Napoleon. Will you be a hungry war monster? Remember this the best simulation of the medievil times.	1
There are enough rave reviews here to get the point across, so I won't spend too much time. This game is addictive, historically fascinating (what if William Wallace did do battle with Genghis Khan?), and very easy on the eyes--the graphics are crystal clear. Just beware, you'll start playing, and without realizing it, the hours have flown by. The game never gets boring, and offers dozens of scenarios. Personal fave: attacking with elephants!	1
To keep things brief, if you liked the first you'll like this one.  It keeps the tried and true formula from Age of Empires and transitions it over into a great sequel.  This game is very easy to pick up and play if you take a few minutes to learn the trades of the game.	1
Age of Empires II is a great game and now that it is an older game the price has really dropped. I saw new copies for $13!!! What a deal! Many, many hours of play. You won't get boring of this game for a long, long time. Wyatt Kaldenberg	1
Microsoft generally isn't the first company that you think of when you are looking for a strategy game.  But after playing Age of Empires 2, you will definitely keep them in mind. Age of Empires 2 is a real-time strategy game that puts you in control of a medieval civilization as it advances in technology, military, and economy.  Victory is acheived by crushing your enemies, allying with victorious factions, or by constructing a Wonder of the World.  The selection of cultures is impressive and includes the Goths, Britons, Japanese, Chinese, and Persians in addition to several others.  Each culture has its own technologies and unique units, such as Viking Longboats or Persian Elephants.  The single-player scenarios allow you to become legendary heroes and conquerors such as William Wallace and Joan of Arc. This is one of the best real-time strategy games available and its multiplayer scenarios will keep you coming back again and again.	1
In Age of Empires: the Age of Kings, you can control one of 13 different civilizations including the English, Mongols, Chinese, Japanese, Byzantines, and many more. Age of Empires 2 is not your typical RTS. Unlike WarCraft and StarCraft, AOE2 requires more thinking on your part rather than creating an army of soldiers and storming the enemy base. That doesn't cut it in AOE2. You actually have to think in order to outsmart the computer (oh my gosh, some of you mindless people actually have to use your so called brains). In regards to AOE2 and the major change I had to go through from playing WarCraft and StarCraft, was the fact that I had to learn how to multitask my characters. In WarCraft and StarCraft the only resources you can gather are either two or three resources. In AOE2 you must gather food, wood, gold, and stone in order to keep your civilization alive. Also the many different upgrades and research items in AOE2 was a big change from WarCraft and StarCraft. In an overall rating, AOE2 outperforms WarCraft and StarCraft by a considerable amount and is 10x more fun and challenging. And your also learning a bit about history as you play (it doesn't get any better than that). Bottom Line: Age of Empires: the Age of Kings is loads of fun. Get it! You won't be dissappointed.	1
Unlike the Civilization series Age of Empires is a real-time stragegy game, forcing you to think fast.  It's for gamers who have brains. :)	1
Great game.  Simple to manipulate and it makes you feel like you are God.  Great too if you like this age in history.	1
Age of Empires is better than other simulation games. Age of Empires 2 Age of the Kings has many features. You can play a Random game which allows you to chose how many players, who is your enemy, what color represents your empire, and what kind of land you want. In a Regicide, you do the same except have to [do away with] the king of the enemy empire to win. AOE Age of the Kings has the best campaigns like the William Wallace Campaign. In the History page you can find out the history from the Britons to the Vikings. Age of Empires represents a strong game. Only if a 3rd version would be made. If you have the game or thinking about buying it here are some cheat codes that may help you: Before typing in the code click ENTER on your keyboard and then type it in Cheese Steak Jimmy's- 1000 food Robin Hood- 1,000 gold rock on- 1,000 stone lumberjack- 1,000 wood aegis- Build buildings fast how do you turn this on (must be spaced& not capitalized)- Cobra car that shoots to smitthereens- a sabotuer that explodes Hope you like the game! I like it so much I play it practically every day.	1
I try not to play this game anymore because it's so much fun: I get done; and realize: it's been about a half a day, and I haven't gotten any work done.	1
This is just like Starcraft except it's not nearly as good....if you like Starcraft this is a big dissapointment compared to it.	-1
For any of you history buffs out there this is the game for you.  Not only is the the gameplay easy to follow and understand the visuals and sounds are great.  The campaign modes are actually fun to play!  Whats up with that?  The game is real easy to pick up and the many different difficulty settings alows you to get better slowly not get frustrated and bite you mouse in half.	1
I'm revising my original review where I originally gave this game 3 stars. After reading more about strategy and tactics I discovered that this game is much more fun than I gave it credit for. I realized that my own shortcomings were to blame and not the game. An excellent and fun addictive game that I recommend. This was my original review: I only gave this 3 stars because it turns out I don't like real-time games as much as turn-based games. If you're like me and you don't like real-time games where everything moves super fast and you don't really have too much time to plan things out, then you won't like this that much, because you need to be quick on your feet! But if you like that kind of thing, then you'll love this. Hope this helps. If you prefer turn-based, try Civilization III (have a fast computer!) or my personal favorite Call to Power II (some people don't like this one as much, but I love it!)	1
Age of empires 2: the age of kings is all about building a small town and defending it against the computer or a friend if you play it online.  You create the army that'll protect your village, and you can send the army to go fight the enemy.  All in all a fun and adictting game.	1
Start with villagers, some resources, a town center and build up you little outpost into a great center of trade, diplomacy, and a place where enemies, who want what you have, are going to destroy you!  this is what Age of Empires 2 is all about.  you start from scratch, with just some mere villagers.  you gather up resources to build an army to conqueror and defend.  its really like all real-time strategy games.  however, unlike some of its counter-parts (ahem... cough starcraft  warcraft cough)  it has a lot of the same buildings and lots of the same core units.  in warcraft and starcraft, every race has different resources gatherers whereas in Age of empires2, you always have the same villager.  in AOE2, the only differences between races would be unique units, and unit/tech trees.  each race has their own econonic boosts and disadvantages.  the unit/tech tree that i am talking about is that each race can make a certain unit and research a certain technology that another race cannot.  for example:  the chinese can build bombard towers, but the celts cannot.  the chinese can build Camels, while the celts cannot.  however, celts can research much stronger infantry technology, including weapons and armor advancements, while the chinese cannot.  overall, you will have lots of fun playing this game no matter if you have played both starcraft and warcraft previously.	1
I think of this game as the ultimate toy soldier set that you dreamed of as a kid- only the toys are alive and intelligent. I've literally spent hundreds of hours playing this game , including more all nighters than I care to admit. If you are a military buff this game can become addictive. You can build whole empires here- either from scratch from the stone age, or with fully developed high middle ages technology (which includes gunpowder weapontry.) You have to build up the infrastructure for your empire including farms, fisheries, mines, and timber. Then you have to build workshops and training schools. Only then can you concentrate on the right mix of cavalry, infantry, archers, and artillery. Just the complexity of the castles and walled towns you can build is fascinating. Yet it is never tedious, you really get a feeling that you are actually building up an empire- your empire for your subjects. And every single individual unit is fully and believably animated. A major advantage of Age of Kings over the earlier Age of Empires is that you can order your fighting units into set formations like squares and lines, instead of just sending a mob into battle. The interface here is unbelievable- the "giant" map actually has the feel of a huge extent of territory- enough for a kingdom or an empire. I prefer this as a single player game- the program is smart and relentless enough to keep you constantly on your toes. Just try playing against 7 to 1 odds with no allies if you don't believe me....	1
I stumbled upon this game about a year or two ago and I strongly recommend it even if you have never experienced a strategy type of game. You are the unseen ruler of one of 13 uinque ancient civilizations. Your objective is to either strive to conquer with a strong military, find and bank three religious relics, or build a wonder to increase the prestige of your civilization. Each time you play you can pick which civ. you want to be, what civ. your enemies and allies are, what objective you are to meet, the difficulty level, the location of your game, how many resources you start out with, and what age ( Dark, Feudal, Feudal, Castle, Umperial) your civ will begin in. Oh, and don't forget about your population limit! But don't think accomplishing this is so easy. Everything has a price to pay in this game and without a large team of villagers to boost the economy, your civilization will not last for long. Even so, a strong, loyal miltary is also needed to defend and protect you at all times. And don't forget, each time you play, more suprises await you. Hold your breath there's more! Along with a general "Random Map" mode comes a few very exciting campaigns where you become Jonah of Arc, Barbarossa, Genghis Khan, William Wallace and more. Oh, boy...more! Although I never have gotten into creating and editing my own scenarios and custom campaigns, that doesnt mean you won't. Taht's right, along with everything else comes a unique feature which allows you to edit pre-made scenarios or cr eate your own. And...if this is your first time with a strategy game a strongly advise you to play the tutorial which (gasp) comes along with the game as well. Keep in mind though that each civilization has it's own pros and cons and each civ. comes with its own unique military unit. And if all of this just isn't enough for you....THAN BUY THE EXPANSION PACK!	1
This is a fun, thought provoking game that will have you playing for hours.  This game can be played by almost anyone.  You can either put a lot of effort into planning your next move against the enemy or just barge your way on through.  The only downside is that over time this game becomes a little boring with having the same buildings and people.  But there is a solution.  The expansion pack is also an excellent game and it just adds to your now experienced game stragedies.  Both games are highly recommended	1
Age of Empires: Age of Kings, is definately one of the better realtime stratagy games on the market at this time. The graphics are very good, giving the game a fun edge to it that will keep you hooked as you play. There are many modes that you can play, either start your own war, trading with your allies, and battling your enemies. Or protecting your king and defeating all of the other fiefdoms before they destroy you. But you can also play as Joan of Arc, or Barbarossa, playing missions and liberating France. This game is fun, but it does have a few drawbacks. Alliances with people are hard to keep. The gameplay is a little difficult, making you keep an eye on 15 places at once. Also, as your town progresses, you can make your town better by moving forward in "ages". There aren't nearly enough of these, more would make the game more inviting and fun to play. Also there is not nearly enough different types of weapons (ie. soldiers, calvary..etc) But, this game is definately engaging, and could easily pass a few hours of boredom	1
Age of the Empire: Age of Kings is the better of the three launched versions of Age of the Empires.  With great graphics, more options and greater control of your game, Age of the Empires allows the player to control what kind of game they like.  Unlike the original version of Age of the Empires you can increase your total population to up to 200, which many times is what is needed in order to achieve world domination.  One hint, you must have a very fast proccessor in order to play the game smoothly. The campaigns on this set are incredible and allow you to progress from the simplest and basic rules of the game into a situation where you are incredibly out-numbered and you have to resort to every strategic bone in your body to win. The only downside is there is not as much control as I would like when it comes to making your own campaigns/scenarios.  The fun part of that the heroes from the campaigns can actually be put into your scenario.  William Wallace, Joan of Arc and even King Richard the Lionhearted. I would recommend this to anyone who likes strategy games.  But mind you, patience is a virtue and be careful to whom you make your allies and who says they want to be your ally!	1
It's no wonder that this game was rated "Game of the Year" by USA Today. And although the honor was bestowed upon it a while back, it still holds true today. For those of you who have played or own the first award-winning Age of Empires, I can assure you that the upgrade is well worth the money. And with rebates, you can get the game for what, about $10 now? I will share some of the updated features that make the game more enjoyable and why you should buy it. The gameplay is much better. As you probably know, in the first Age of Empires, you could only build one unit at a time per building, and the "Rise of Rome" expansion only allowed you to build multiple units of the same type. The Age of Kings allows you to que multiple units of different types, up to a maximum of 15 at a time. The units are also able to move much easier. As it was easy in the first version to block and trap your own units with buildings, The Age of Kings makes sure that your units can always find a way through. There are also features that allow you to set the stance and actions of your units. For example, you can set units to guard another unit, to patrol, and to follow an enemy unit at long range. You can also set to aggressive, defensive, stand ground, and no attack stance. The units, and especially the villagers, work and move much faster, which I have found as a huge plus. The graphics are much better, more detailed, and the motions of the units are better. This game is like RollerCoaster Tycoon, SimCity, and Command and Conquer all rolled into one. What a great combination! If I can give you one piece of advice, I would say to buy this now.	1
'Age of Empires II' has been named on many many PC top ten lists, and for good reason too!  Simply put, this is just an amazingly fun and interesting game.  'Age of Empires II' will take your breath away, it's a must own for any PC gamer, or even someone who's never played a computer game!  Anyone will love this. There are many levels of difficulty, which is excellent.  Once you master one level or strategy, you can change the settings (and certain characteristics in the game, such as what type of terrain you get, which makes all the difference).  You must manage any one of thirteen civilizations, ranging from the Turks to the Vikings.  Each civilization has it's own unique benefits and drawbacks and their own style of buildings and armies.  You collect natural resources, advance through ages by meeting requirments in your stockpiles, create workers, explore, conquer, build an army, make allies, engage in trade and battle, and so much more!  The graphics are some of the best I've seen in a strategy game and always keep you involved with the game. You can also choose certain types of games.  A campaign game involves a certain sort of goal (like escorting Joan of Arc to the king).  Their is a death match game, where you duke it out with other empires, and so much more.  There is a delightful training game which involves the famous William Wallace teaching you the basics of the game, I found this to be extremely helpful.	1
I've had this game for a week. I finally picked it up, played it, and explored the game a bit. I'm still learning the game, but here's the story how it is so far.  The game is excellent. Plenty of depth, fun, and many different units and buildings. Each building has specific functions and people it can create, making the game all the more intricate and exciting. You can research "new" technologies and go from the Dark Age through the Imperial Age. The game is a non-stop blast.  But wait...it is much more fun to play on the MSN Gaming Zone. You can actually talk to your ally(allies) and chat and trade resources, make strategies, etc. You can't entirely do this with the computer. I love playing with other people, because it adds that much more excitement. Here's how to play with other people via the internet:  Go to zone.msn.com..... Click Sign In. If needed, get a free MSN passport. Next, in the games list, click Age of Empires II. It will ask to install the MSN Gaming Zone. Click yes. After it's done, click Age of Empires II. Select a game room (I preffer Hunt the Royal) and you'll see big icons for various games. Click Join on one game room. When the host is ready, the game will be launched, and you'll be ready for some fun. *Make sure you have Age Of Empires II in the CD-ROM drive when you go to the Game Zone! Happy conquering!	1
Overall, this game rocks. THe gameplay is superb and the graphics rock thte house. THe one thing of the game that I do not like is that You cannot build a lot of buildings. It can be very annoying if you want to build a big city. This game is a little like the game Startcraft if anyone of you played that. AOE2's excitement isn't as high as other games but in order to win all the campains you need to have a strategy. Wheter getting to a place or other taks, all of them need planning. If you want to defeat another town without any cheasts, You have to creat a certain amount of villagers to work for you. THis game is really good but why don't they have buildings from Age of Empires 1 like the goverment center? Well here is a overview of what I think of this game   Graphics:8 THe games graphics are pretty good. It may not have the best graphics but O.K.   Gameplay:EXCELLENT. This game isn't that exciting if you know what I mean but can last you some time   Value:moderate high. THis game won't last forever but will last a very long time   Concept:10 great campains. I would give it a 10.   This game is fabulous! Get it!	1
When I first got this game, I loved it. I played it over and over. Soon, I wanted to play online- I figured, with some allies, I was good enough. But, Zone.com would somehow not work. I ran into hundreds of problems. It said AoE was not installed, or that the program could not be launched, or a number of other things. I got frustrated and went back to single player. However, eventually, I tired of playing the computer. But, I couldn't get zone.com to work, so I stopped playing. <fast forward a year, little less> I finally picked it up again and tried zone.com. It took me hours, but eventually I overcame each problem until a giant barrier stoof in my way. FIREWALL! After 3 days I got the ports to open. This is a wonderful game in which you control a civilization to victory by conquering another civi's city. It is different every time you play. I HIGHLY reccommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the Command and Conquer series.	1
AOE2 is one of the best on its genre, still is so damn popular on the multizone, no matter if you play the solo missions or the standard games you will get a thrill. As always it's an excellent companion to many of our "lonely nights". Maybe the only thing is on the multiplayer option which is sometimes a little bit complicated. Anyway, this game is a must for your collection.	1
When i first played Age of empires i knew the 2nd one would be a hell of alot better than the first. It was so much better. The resolution was better, the castle age and imperial age are an excellent add on.(The dark age and fudel are just like the ones in age of empires 1.) The new weapons, buildings, castles are my favorite. This game has no end to the limits. Multiplayer is so much fun except when there is lag. This game deserves to be honored with 4 stars because of its authentic gameplay.	1
The mother of all good games has given birth to yet another beautifully done game. AOEII is what one could call the prime example of its genre. Most RTS's force you to ... your oppenent with bigger guns, but in AOEII that is not the case. Military is simply a defense, and in times of need, an army for war. The various paths and civilizations make you all warm and comfy. The first thing you are greeted with is a beautiful cinematic from yours truly, Microsoft Games. Then there's the multitude of campaigns, all of which were done excellently. The engine is a truly refined version of ye old AOEI. Formations for your men (and women) is a great new thing that adds some strategy to your game, and the new game options are just terrific. My true favorite is Regicide, in which each player has a King character and the last one standing wins. Sometimes when others destroy my entire civilization I like to hide my King in the forests, just for time. AOEII is definetely an enjoyable game, instead of wasting $20 on Starcraft, spend it on this better game.	1
Age of Empires II has a particular strength: its "standard game." A number of variables may be set by the user or left to random selection (such as nationality and geography). This provides a nearly limitless combination of foes, allies, and landscapes on which to play. Each of the approximately 15 nationalities has unique abilities - imagine Starcraft with 15 alien races instead of 3. Turtling is limited by the trebuchet - a huge catapult - and cannons. If you get the game you will want the expansion as it allows more automated farming and provides new races such as the Aztec. MS is on the right track with this very impressive game.	1
I must say that this game is the best game I have ever played.  I bought this game a year ago and I have been getting better and better ever since.  For those of you who don't know, Age of Empires 2: Age of kings is a game where you choose from 13 diffrent ancient civilizations( Teutons, Celts, Byzantines, Persians, etc) and build a Powerful Empire, then you destroy other players empires.  The diffrent civilizations have almost completely diffrent technologies so it is impossible to get bored.  The best part of AOK is multiplayer.  I have made so many friends and have had so much fun.  The most popular types of play online are Random Map (RM) and Deathmatch (DM).  Random Map is where you start with a limited supply of resources in a dark time or the Dark Ages and work your way up.  Death Match is where you start in the Post-Imperial Age with a huge supply of resources and basically get straight to the battle.  Of course there are Scenerios, and Regicide but those aren't as popular.  Another fun aspect of online play is the rating system.  With this sytem you can see how you rank up to other players.  In conclusion I would like to say one thing, BUY THIS GAME!  YOU WONT REGRET IT!	1
It ain't easy being king, but it sure is a heck of a fun time in 'Age of Kings II', one of the best PC historical real-time strategy games out there. There's not much I can say to extoll the virtues of this extremely fun game that hasn't already been said. Only thing I can add is that I couldn't stand these games till I picked this one up. It's hard to describe the sheer pleasure of building a massive army, leading them straight to the walls of one of your allies cities, suddenly declaring yourself enemy and have your guys raze the place to the ground. This game is packed with options, including the requisite multiplayer feature (itself loaded with options) several one-player historical campaigns and a special campaign specifically made to teach you the game. My favourite part is the campaign/scenario editor, where you can build your own battle from scratch. All in all, one of the most perfect strategy games on the market...at least till AoE III is released.	1
This is an incredible game. The graphics are stunning. The game play is fast paced. The stories are sweet. The Multiplay is awesome. Graphically, as you roam the land, you see deer running around, birds flying in the sky, and other creatures roaming around in the stunning environment. During scenarios, you don't hve time to mess around on alot of these as the enemy seems to find you rather quickly. Some of the battles are very intense and killing your enemy is no easy task. The stories are wonderful as you have the opportunity to play some of the greatest leaders that ever existed. Ghenghis Khan and Joan of Arc are just 2 of the 4 stories you get to play. It's like a history lesson while your playing as you learn their story and then fight their battles for them. The multiplay is awesome as far as I have seen as I have not had much time doing this. If you like real time games, this is a keeper.	1
Age of Empires II is a fun game, as well as educational. It's a lot like Pharaoh and Caesar III. You take control of different armies and conquerers, such as Ghengis Khan or Barbarossa. Though it may be difficult controlling huge armies at one time, you get use to it. Age of Empires II also has a different control interface that you need to get used to: left-click selects, right-click commands. Taunts are added to this game; they are mostly for fun. Some taunts are: "Raiding party!", "Nice town; I'll take it.", and "It is good to be the king." Overall, Age of Empires II is a great game. I recommend it to strategy game- lovers who are quick with their mouse.	1
Microsoft actually out-did themselves with this sequel to one of the greatest strategy CD Rom games ever.  This is bascially the same game as the original, only it's set in the Dark Ages.  It is also a bit faster paced than the first one.  AE II also offers a multitude of extra features not included in its predecessor, as well as a graphics package which leaves the old version in the dust.  The buildings on AE II are much more life-size and intricate in detail.  They are also more varied than the first & include Cathedrals and Castles. Among the new features is your ability to garrison your townspeople in buildings & towers to get them out of harms way.  Instead of being all men (like the first one), this one also includes female townspeople as well as Joan of Arc.  Also new is the ability to create several types of military units at the same time using the same barracks / stable / archery range, etc.  In the old version, you could make several units of one kind, but not several units of different kinds.  A helpful  aspect, to say the least.  Another nice characteristic of the game is that you can actually upgrade scouts to light calvery.  That means that you can have military units on horseback (that don't cost any gold) which are actually semi-decent in combat (not so with AE I). This is a must-buy game for anyone who even casually enjoyed AE I.  The expanded features and updated graphics give you a whole new realm to explore, command and conquer.  Time to move up to the Age of Kings.  Good luck!	1
There are times in the gaming industry that a certain game will come along and reshape the way we think about how that genre is played. StarCraft did this for RTS. And AOE II expanded on the trusted design of that and made a game that is historically accurate, fun to play, completely balanced, and free of bugs (which is all-too-common in games today). You can choose one of 13 civilizations to play in a skirmish. Or you can play King of the Hill. Or you can play Fortress. Or you can play...I think you get the point. There are tons of options for single player game play. And the historically accurate missions follow the lives, trials and battles of William Wallace, Joan of Arc, Ghengas Khan, Barbarosa, and Saladin. While these campaigns are somewhat static and "rail," they are engrossing and interesting. All 13 civilzations are wonderfully balanced. Unique units for each are an especially nice touch. And the ages that you advance through provide a new element of strategy (for instance, you will never even consider attacking with the Turks in the early stages because of their advantange in the later stages; likewise, the Britons and Persians are ideal for a quick win because of their advantages in earlier ages. Once you advance with them, you'll find that they don't have the "strength" needed to pull ahead, though I have devised numerous strategies for the Britions that will allow victory in the late ages). Overall, one of the best games ever. You are without excuse to not own this game. Even non-RTS fans will enjoy it.	1
This is by far one of the best real-time strategy games available. The game style is superbly unique, and even shames the classic "Warcraft II". The many different types of units, buildings, and technologies makes the game very interesting for a long period of time, and the difficulty of the missions makes this a game that will remain on your hard drive for at least several months are you purchase it. Even the experienced gamer will find "Age of Empires II" difficult, and the newbie will probably be at it for quite some time. I played most of the missions on the "easiest" setting, and they were still quite challenging and addictive. You have several various options within the game. First, you can play tour of duty campaigns in which you play as various civilizations (The Celts and Franks to name a few) against different kind of enemies. These missions are generally the most difficult part of the game, and most have you at them for hours before you finally come out the victor. The other two sections of the game are multiplayer (which you can play over a network or on the internet) and custom campaigns which let you play against the computer in a multiplayer style gaming environment. In this type of game, you get to pick any one of the 14 different civilizations to be, all of which have unique strengths and weaknesses. It's quite fun to go through each civilization researching new weapons and upgrades to see which fits you the best. Even though "Age of Empires II" is beginning to be dated, the game is still excellent and worth the money. This will be one to go down as a "classic", very similar to "Warcraft II". A definite buy.	1
I recently borrowed this game from my freind thinking it was going to be a boring warcraft/starcraft wannabe what I got was even better than I expected! There are 13 races to choose from each with different characters and buildings so they is unlimited gameplay. Sometimes the battles can be difficult and frustrating but you always find yourself coming back for more. The greatest Strategy game of all time. Period. With no doubt!	1
This game is so much better then AoE. First it has super graphics, and great gameplay. It is very replayable, b/c it comes with a random map generator. There are only a couple problems; on my 333mgz, 32ram it gets pretty slow after you get to around 70 units. Also it can get sort of boring if you play it a lot. All in all, this game was worth its money. I suggeset that you buy it.	1
This is the best real time strategy game available and I will explain why. 1) If you are into playing with friends and people on the internet and  having a fun time, you WILL love this. This, in my mind, is by far the most  fun to play game on the market and the single player is just as versatile  and enjoyable as the multiplayer. 2)The various civiliaztions have  their own unique strengths and weaknesses which surpass even the  civilizations of the first game. The combinations of units for attack and  defense is virtually limitless. Each unit has at least two counter units  which slaughter it horribly. (Example: Pikemen and Camels and Mamelukes  defeat all types of cavalry with ease.) 3)Even the A.I. in this game is a  challenge to beat on its hardest level, and the easiet levels let beginner  players get a chance to get the feel of the game and learn the civilization  attributes before taking on other human players.   Peace	1
I have to admit, the original game didn't really impress me all that much. So I wasn't holding out very high hopes for the sequel. So you can imagine my stunned surprise when I found out that Age of Empires 2 (AOE2) was a  surprisingly good game. The biggest improvement in the game was the user  interface. I think AOE2 has the most advanced user interface ever  introduced in a real-time strategy game. It makes it extremely easy to  control the formation and behaviour of your troops, and queing units is a  snap. The second strength is the AI, which (along with Dark Reign) is the  most complex in any game to-date. The AI will respond to attacks on its own  bases, and it will send large strike forces against your armies. However, AOE2's greatest weakness is its lack of a cohesive  single-player campaign. Instead of a series of missions linked with a  cohesive storyline, you have several separate campaigns, each centering  around a different empire. So the missions are more like skirmishes than  really cohesive campaigns. Regrettably, Starcraft is still the king when it  comes to single-player campaigns. For the above stated reason, I must  remove one star. Other than that, AOE2 is a game every discerning computer  strategy gamer should have on their PC.	1
Brilliant game if you start here. If you played AOE 1 I am sure you have already purchased Age of Kings. Lots of hours of thrilling, fascinating and ever changing gameplay in here. I guess it is a must-have for all real  time strategy fans. After playing AOE and AOK I will buy the follow up  without hesitation as soon as it lands.	1
The first Age of Empires was a critical and consumer success, gaining rave reviews and selling over 2 million copies. The first was a success because of the blend of strategy action and historical charcters. The sequel, The Age of Kings, expands on this winning formula, and in doing so, creates the  best real time strategy game avaliable on the market. The game focuses on  13 major empires, such as the Persians, Vikings and Japanese. As head of  one of these 13 kingdoms, you must defeat your enemies to gain rulership  over all the land. This is very fun, being that each race is varried and  has different strengths and weaknesses. It is also fun, because each one  has a different look to them, the Japanese buildings look much different  than the Vikings. The real fun of the game starts when you play the preset  historical scenerios. You take control of such historical figures as Joan  of Arc, Genghis Khan and William Wallace (ie Braveheart). These are all  historically accurate and can help you learn a great deal about the time  period. There also is an excellant multiplayer game, featuring the usual  deathmatch games, as well as a regicide game, which gives each team a king,  and the first one to destory each others king. All of these features add up  to the best RTS game on the market for the money. The guide for the game,  is also a great value, it retails at 20 dollars and gives you all you would  need to know about the game, without spoiling it.  All and all, this  is the best game you can buy, and you will enjoy it for a long, long time.	1
I have always been intrigued by war strategy games but never really enjoyed the ridiculous amount of micro managing involved.  I also used to think that the games were too long and that after pouring 30 hours of your  life into building a civilization you can get wiped out kinda sucked(OK,  nothing compared to 1000s of years but...).  This game is nothing like the  ones I don't like.  AOE2 is FANTASTIC.  Games are generally no more than 3  hours, there is a little micromanagement but it's worth it.  The graphics  are wonderful and the sound and animation are amazing.  If you are a die  hard strategy fan, this may not do it for you, but as a person with a life,  I love this game!	1
This is one of my favorite computer games around. The graphics are great, and the gameplay is terrific. I love all the different empires you can control, everything from British to Chinese. The strategy is much the same  as the first installment of Age of Empires, but if it ain't broke don't fix  it. Lots of fun with this one.	1
AOE2 is simply amazing...I've never played AOE1 so I can't make any comparisons, but look--AOE2 beats out much of the great RTS games (including my favorite game Starcraft) by including 13 civilizations with  infantry, cavalry, archery, naval units, siege weapons... and all kinds of  defense measures, including all-mighty castles and bombard towers.  The  diversity of units might be less than some widely popular games, but you  can understand and feel every single part of this game.  Upgrades from  Cavaliers to Paladins and Archers to Crossbowmen make sense--they aren't  just words from nowhere.  And if you're looking for a great campaign game,  this is it--there are carefully made videos and sounds (just as starcraft)  for the campaigns, and I especially enjoy the diversity of these one player  missions.  The 1st Mongolian mission was very interesting, requiring you to  befriend the different  tribes by bringing them sheep, killing the wolf  pack, founding the sacred relic, etc.  I also liked how this game handled  commerce.  There are a variety of types of resources (gold, stone, food,  and wood to be precise) and you can build trading carts to earn gold by  trading with other players, pay tribute, etc. etc.  This game is simply a  must-buy...it's worth every penny.	1
I had been a die-hard fan of AOE for about a year and a half before AOE2 hit the shelves. I didn't pick it up until about March but I loved this one twice as much as the first and here's why: (1) Unlike the first, AOE2  offers you the ability to garrison units which is great for an ambush. (2)  AOE2 also offers players the ability to place units in formations such as  the box, staggered, etc. (3) New scenarios which actually help players  learn to craft and fine-tune their skills. (4) The ability to save a  multi-player game. How many times have you been in an awesome two hour game  when something comes up; no more. (5) Great new customizable scenario  building tools that make it more fun then ever. (6) Castles, Unique Units,  and all the other new buildings and techs. (7)Trading from the market- a  simple way to trade for that 200 gold for the easy castle from the feudal  age. (8) Recorded games- a great way to fine-tune your skills by learning  from a master. (9)More Random Maps for total playability. (10) Right-Click  farming, ah, that is what get's me on this game. Before you had to click a  villager click the build, etc. No more! Just right-click the farm, saves  you plenty of much-needed playing time. Age of Empires 2 outdoes its  predecessor by far and becomes highly addictive and playable day after day  after day.	1
I'm not exactly unbiased, here; I absolutely loved Age of Empires.  The moment I got word that AoE2 was in the works, I knew I would buy it.  AoE had so many great aspects; real-world history, great graphics, intelligent  interface and build systems and excelent and varied resource gathering.  Everything you want in an RTS.  Their best achievement, though, was the  random map feature... endless replayability. Of course, AoE had it's  faults: bad AI pathfinding, not enough distinction between the different  cultures (every culture had the same vocal cues, BIG no-no), some  others. AoE2: the Age of Kings is a wonderful sequel for many reasons,  the most significant being gameplay. Military units now have the  desperately needed behavior and formation commands, making combat  infinitely more interesting and fun.  Garissoning units allows for better  protection of your peasants (and better defense of your hometown), as well  as allowing for ambushes.  Farming is now more realistic, with farms that  roll over any terrain and that are renewable at a click.  Plus all the  great multiplayer customization is back, with many splendid additions.  Perhaps best of all, the military units are exquisitely balanced against  each other, with each society having a unique unit that allows for varied  and exciting combat. While gameplay should be the number one concern of  any developer, the graphics (while beautiful) are the same as they ever  were.  However, keep in mind that beautiful graphics cannot mask an  uninteresting or unoriginal game (Total Annihilation: Kingdoms, Unreal,  Quake 3 Arena).  Great gameplay will always shine through mediocre or  outdated graphics (Starcraft, Caesar 3, Prince of Persia). AoE2 is one to  get.	1
There has always been a dispute over which is better; real time or turn based strategy.  And for the last couple of years we've seen many of the large names in the computer gaming industry (i.e Fraxis, Activision, Blizzard, and Mircosoft) battle it out on each seperate turf in order to  gain the coveted spot at the top of the strategy gaming world.   This year, the well known little sequal to the foundering Ages of Empire  has been seen by some as one of those few RTS games that will breath new  life into an old genre.  In my opinion, it's a great game, but it's still  got all the same RTS components.   First off, let me just say  that the graphics in this game are beautiful; all the castles for each of  the 12 individual countries are different and highly detailed.  In  addition, each countries forces and militaries are also seperated from  eachother, making the whole experince very real.  Plus it's cool to see  literally hundereds of little army men that are under your control battle a  whole army to the death with a single click of the mouse.   However, I do have a couple of qualms.  First off, It's no starcraft or  even warcraft.  The AI, in my opinion, although completly overhauled from  the first game, is still lacking in some places.  And second, although the  senarios are all based on historical wartime events, (i.e Joan of Ark or  William Wallace vs Longshanks) they really have no replay value otherwise.  However, when all is said and done, compared to the first game, this  stunning sequal has a lot to offer to the RTS gaming world.  However, it's  still far from revolutionary (no pun intended) The Good News:  If you  like RTS games and like to line Bill Gates pockets (no offense Bill) then  go for it. The Bad News:  If you're looking for something you won't shelf  after you're done with it, look someplace else. In the end: To the Victor  goes the spoils, and this time, the victor is Microsoft.	1
This game clearly wipes out any other strategy game out there.  Age 1 was great...Age 2 is better!  Why?  Better everything! Better graphics, sounds, AI (how smart the computer plays), etc.  Also, most popular game on the MSN Gaming Zone!  If your a strategy fan, this is a game you don't want to  miss.  Every online game site, and magazine rated this game at least  9.0/10.  And people complain about RAM? I got 48, and it runs good with 2  players.  One problem, but it can be fixed: Computer surrenders.  Just  download an update from Microsoft, and done!  Well, I'm off to play Aoe2!	1
For my money, this is the finest strategy game on the market.  The balance of the various kingdoms is far better than in the original, with all empires having serious strengths and equally devastating weaknesses.  One  must learn the value of combining force types into effective mixtures of  defense and offensive units to even have a chance at success.  The serious  player will probably take something on the order of a year to master the  game, because the complexity level is so high. The campaigns on this  sequel are of a much hgiher caliber than those on the orignal, so  single-player use is very much improved.  In fact, the campaigns are  actually historically accurate, unlike those in AOE.  Indeed, the  historical section on the CD is fascinating reading in and of itself, and  will please those who love the time period, as well as the tactical  problems involved. AOK's real strength, though, is like that of its  predecessor:  the game's extreme playability over network.  I heard that  AOE was the most popular network game ever, and there's no reason AOK won't  follow in its footsteps.  This is GREAT stuff to play in real time with  others.  Be warned, though:  players in Microsoft's Gaming Room are  ruthless to the novice.  Don't even think about going online until you've  gained a level of proficiency playing by your own.  And take the time to  learn the keyboard shortcuts:  you'll need the time it saves. For most  games, I think that strategy guides are a wimp's way out, but with AOK, I  highly recommend the Ensemble Studios' guide.  It's invaluable to improving  the quality of your game-playing experience.	1
First of all, I loved AOE I, and was looking very mush forward to the second comming. And WHAT a game!  Everything that you've been scream about i all these years that where missing in RTS games is in this one. There  even a button you can click to cyckle through idle villagers, and soldiers.  Emsemble Studios have created (in my oppision) one of best RTS games to  date. And the built-in campaigns are clever, though and lots of fun to  play. Almost everything in this game is a masterstroke, although it takes  cute a machine to play it. But if you have a Pentium 400 or above with a  lot of ram, and a videocard (12 md over more) there's absolutly no problem  in playing this, even in 1280 x 1024. Buy it and be preparad to lose some  time of you life, because this game is addictive.	1
The first Age of Empires was great. The second one just plain sucked. Sure it has good graphics and an easy to use interface, but the game would always crash both of my computers. You can only play in 800x600 or above  which is a downside also. My computers are not old either, one is a 300p-2  160megs ram 17 inch monitor, voodoo3 etc. The other is a 450 amd k6-2 96  megs ram, Ati graphics, 15 inch monitor. I just wanted to put this warning  out to those who will be purchasing it. It may work fine for you, but I had  problems. It sure is not addictive as the first AOE. Buggy software! Blahh!  I am not anti Microsoft by the way.	-1
I played many/most of the MOH games but never this first one until I recently bought it.  The sounds of the guns in this game are awesome and the feeling of the rumble of the PS1 dualshock once again was nostalgic.  The targeting system/zoom of this game was very different than other MOH games, but it didn't take me long to adjust.  Despite looking visually dated, this game was still enjoyable to play.	1
THIS GAME IS A CLASSIC! Love the MOH series and this is the game that started it all! Go deep into enemy territory as An American OSS officer fighting in Nazi Germany During WW2. This game has it all. It's sooooooooooo Sick. You Battle tanks, sabotage U-Boats, take out machine gun turrets and just kick nazi but in general. The game play is pretty straight forward so you can just pick up and go! You owe it to yourself to pick up a gaming classic!!!!	1
great item	1
Fun WW2 game with great sound and nice graphics.  Though the graphics are dated today it's still fun for those who like retro and/or war games.	1
I for one LOVE this game. This game, Syphon Philter and Metal Gear Solid defined my childhood. I love how the disc was here a day before it was expected and there was no scratch on it whatsoever....it was as if it were brand new. I HIGHLY recommend it from these guys.	1
GREAT GAME. FATHER LOVES IT. SOME PARTS THOUGH BROUGHT BACK PTSD. SO BE CAREFUL ON THIS GAME IF YOU ARE A VETERAN.	1
this was a good game it got here in time for christmas thanks to the Goodwill of California. thanks so much for a great product. and in a timely manner.	1
This game was stellar for it's release time, and is still fun with a solid soundtrack and presentation. Graphically it is showing it's age however, and the control scheme is different from most FPS configurations and will take a bit to get used to. There are some interaction issues with objects in the environment (getting hung up on invisible objects, clipping into walls and trying to find the way out) that happened 4-5 times throughout the game.  It's interesting to see things that have become standard fare in FPS games done here much earlier.	1
Electronic Arts has their papers in order. This game was the first FPS I played for the PS1. One of the best FPS games of all time. Epic campaign, fun multiplayer, and cool cheats make this game the best medal of honor game of all time. The funnest part of this game is shooting the officers in the head after they asked you for your papers and they said they were not in order. Must buy if somehow don't already have this classic.	1
okay this game may be for the first playstation but the new medal of honors for playstation2 etc. just suck basically in the newest one (medal of honor vanguard) you just go around killing things (no point)this one has a story mode theres actually a briefing. and the phisycs are broken i killed a german and his body floated up and disapeered. WTF? the first medal of honor the bodys don't do that. the AI is okay. and i have never had a problem with this game i give it a 5 out of 5. Oh i love the funky ways the germans die too.	1
How many Medal of Honor games are on the market these days?  More than enough!  Let's talk about the very first one, on the original Playstation.  This game is a fantastic first-person shooter *and* a great World War II game.  You get the best of both worlds with Medal of Honor.  I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that when it comes to first-person shooters, I am absolutely *horrible* at them.  Enemies seem to find a way to come out of nowhere ALL the time and cheap-shot me, and then, of course, I die very quickly.  With most games like this, you barely have enough time to react to their insane shooting rampage and learn the controls before it's quickly "game over".  With Medal of Honor I can FINALLY put those nightmare problems to rest.  I can actually complete about 50% of this game, which, by my standards, is a BIG pat on the back.  I never would have guessed understanding a game like this was possible (and be able to complete some levels) but it's true!  Here's why:  - The buttons are laid out *perfectly* on the Playstation controller.  The target button is really easy to use.  You can use the directional pad to move it around and locate the enemy.  It never fails. The shoot button works great.  The jump and duck buttons work great.  EVERYTHING works great!  When you aim at something before shooting, it actually works.  It's amazing how many games get this wrong and the whole experience is ruined.  The play control is a major improvement compared to Syphon Filter, for example.  In that game, it felt like I was awkwardly walking or sliding all over the place.  - The challenge in Medal of Honor is perfect for people who are NOT professionals when it comes to first-person shooters.  The challenge in each level builds and builds, very slowly, allowing you to learn and master the controls while you make progress.  Syphon Filter fails to do this.  So does Metal Gear Solid.  Medal of Honor is an easy-to-understand shooting game for people who normally aren't very good at these kind of games.  I really want to thank DreamWorks (the company responsible for this game) for making the challenge just right.  Also, you encounter just a few cutscenes here and there, and each one is very interesting to watch because they show you what it was like during World War II, and you may even learn some stuff about the war that you've never known before.  Good cutscenes.  The objectives you have to complete are always pretty fun, and not too difficult (until later in the game).  When I say "not too difficult" I mean, not too difficult to understand *and* not too difficult to complete.  Whenever you want to find out what you have to do, just press the Start button and your short and simple objectives will be given to you right there.  As a shooting game, Medal of Honor shines and easily surpasses most first-person shooters once again.  Enemies are everywhere, and many of them want you dead immediately.  Luckily, they give you enough time to react.  When you arrive to a harder level later on... well, keep in mind that you will have to keep playing certain levels over and over, and learn where each and every enemy is located, and take them out as quickly and effectively as you can.  Trust me, this is really fun.  It's *so* much fun to find out which gun you're carrying is most effective on the enemy you encounter.  You will probably lose a bunch of times while you learn, but this is all part of the fun.  Making it to the end of a level *doesn't* require luck like in Syphon Filter, and you will feel satisfied once you've completed a stage.  You can even play the completed stages over and over again, if you want.  Medal of Honor is so good, why not play the same stages over a hundred times?  I don't know what else to say.  I love this game.  Oh yeah, the music and sound effects!  The music is like listening to a suspenseful, realistic war movie.  It's really good.  The sound effects are awesome as well because each soldier you encounter has something interesting and different to say.  You will be amazed at how many new lines these soliders can come up with!  You will hear the sound of silence while walking around in the dark, along with the sound of distant gunshots and other creepy sounds.  All this adds up to a disturbingly, realistic wartime experience.  Oh, and the animations you will see from enemies falling over after they've been shot is *clearly* a notch above the rest.  Even after killing these guys a million times, they seem to find new ways to amaze me with their ability to squirm around and struggle to survive.  Simply put, you will *always* see soldiers do different things before they die. Sometimes they shoot wildly all over the place while falling over and dying.  Other times they will fall to their knees before falling over for good.  Wherever you shoot on their body, they will react very realistically.  Shoot them in the foot they hop around.  These are probably normal and understandable things that a human being would do if they were dying.  The weapons are what you'd expect in a wartime game.  Very good weapons, and very easy to aim and use them on an enemy.  No problems here.  I haven't encountered any blood in the game yet, but, as far as I'm concerned, blood is overrated because the color red is just that- a color.  It means nothing to the actual gameplay.  Some very minor problems I had is that sometimes your main character moves around too quickly, which means sometimes you may accidentally walk right into danger, and the graphics are slightly dark and dated.  Just slightly.  Don't forget the occasional Playstation glitches.  Also, there are actually loading times in the game.  It takes 10-15 seconds to load a stage.  I thought by 1999, loading times were a thing of the past.  Despite these problems, Medal of Honor is still a near-perfect game.  Overall, please buy this awesome first-person shooter.  Today, in 2007, first-person shooters and war games (specifically World War II games) are all OVER the place to the point where it's almost boring to play one anymore.  This is because war time games are a genre that has lost its appeal over the years, thanks to overexposure and repeating more or less the same required-strategies with each new game that gets released.  In other words, all war games are basically the same thing these days.  It's boring.  But guess what?  Back in 1999, when Medal of Honor was brand new, the Playstation didn't have a whole lot of games like this, and war games were treated with more respect, which make Medal of Honor all the more special. Pick it up.	1
I love this game. BRAVO well done. The only negative things I have to say is that I wish they allowed you to do more hand to hand combat or knife fighting and that I wish the game had more gadgets like binoculars and a map.	1
EA has finally made a action/adventure game worth playing for the PS.In this game you will come across many different types of enemy soldiers through its 7 missions and 24 levals. There will be Wehrmacht light infantry, Gestopo police, snipers, and much more. The missions are well done and provide a felling that your watching a old WW2 film. The missions range from sobotageing a deadly U-boat to destroying a rail gun. The missions never get boreing and always are challengeing. The graphics are the best your going to get on the PS and the replay valu is much greater than that of the 007 games and most other shoot 'em up games. This game is great and is worth buying for the PS.	1
The original "Medal of Honor" game is fun to play. Despite graphics that are cheezy by PS2 standards, gamers will find a thrilling experience! Grade: B+	1
All around GREAT game! One of the finest playstation has to offer. Everything from the menu interface, the fluid 1st person gameplay, to the difficulty of missions... Simply amazing. It would be perfect, if only their were more levels... Don't get me wrong, 20+ missions kept me busy for over a month, but once you complete the final objective, you feel an emptiness. A fantastic void that alters your perception on how video games should leave you after the final level. Oh yeah.. it's that good. One of the best features this title has is fully orchestrated background music. It draws you completly into the main character and his surroundings. I haven't had a chance to play much multiplayer, but the little Ive experienced, it definitly gets my vote. So stop wasting your time reading reviews and just get it! Besides the Medal of Honor: Underground sequal, I have yet to find any other action games that match up to Medal of Honor. Good good times.	1
Medal of Honor is an absolutely outstanding game. True, it has alot in common with Wolfenstein 3D(which is also an excellent game)with the germans and it being a first-person shooter. But, this game is reality-based with real wartime objectives and that is what sets it apart from Wolfenstein 3D. To be honest, when I first played it, I wasn't expecting much. Boy, was I surprised afterwards. I mean, this game totally engulfs you and makes you feel as though you're actually there. Graphically, the game may be a bit grainy but it doesn't take from the game. You hardly notice that once you get into it. The sound is what truly shines in this game. Everything from germans yelling to one another to shotgun fire to explosions. Control is deadon, no complaints there. The gameplay is engaging and intense and, at times, difficult but extremely fun nonetheless. I give the highest honor to this game. It's one that I highly recommend to all FPS fans and/or action fans alike. It's definitely a classic that will stand for all-time.	1
On a visual standard Medal of Honor looks great. MOH features excellent looking explosions, beautifully designed levels, and great detail on the bodies. The overall look of MOH is breathtaking, you'd think with that much action on one screen you would experience slowdown, but that isn't the case in Medal of Honor. I've been playing the game non-stop and haven't noticed a touch of slowdown. Overall crisp visuals, great looking explosions and flawless frame rate, make MOH of the most enjoyable game too look at.   The game's main stand is it's unbelievable gameplay. Playing this game almost makes you feel like you are literally in the war. It's main idea is to re-live WWII all over again, you are a US Soldier who is the best in his class who was hired by an agency and is out to carry missions. On your missions you will encounter German Nazis that need a little lesson, teach them one and keep going. Every stage has at least 3 or more missions to be completed and on some you will need to use your noodle a little. Since this title's main focus is the realism, EA has decided to include an array of weapons. Everything from a regular handgun to a shotgun and even to a rocket launcher. Besides having tons of weapons to choose from you also can take control over an enemy's machine gun. You may notice these powerful machine guns in almost every stage implanted into the ground. You can take over them by pressing Square and shot the enemies.   Now that we have got the weapons out of our hands, I can now talk about tactics. First of I want to mention that the Artificial Intelience is incredibly smart, so you won't be dealing with idiots that don't even run away from grenades. No way, if you throw a grenade at the enemy he will either pick it up and throw it back at you or he will kick it away. In terms of gameplay this game can truly be compared to GoldenEye. It's AI is far more intelligent than that found in GoldenEye, MOH features a more extensive line of weapons than GoldenEye and the game (MOH) has a better balance. Medal of Honor actually features a good story line, and the cameras aren't bouncy. There is more to be said, but in the end Medal of Honor leaves Nintendo's GoldenEye in the dust.   Here comes the greatest aspect, it's revolutionary sound. Playing Medal of Honor will definitely make you feel like you are in a movie theater watching some action flick, say something like Star Wars EP1. The game's sound effects are truly mesmerizing, every shatter, every footstep, every gun shot can be heard, and the clarity is to die for. If you have a big screen TV, and a powerful stereo system make sure to hook both up and play Medal of Honor, because I swear to you if you pump up the volume you WILL be experiencing World War 2. And last but not least the game also features dialogue during in and out of the mission.   On the control side the game, it isn't really disappointing but control takes time to get used to. This is a 1st person shooter and their are controls to be learned. The top shoulder buttons (L1, R1) are for moving sideways, L2 is to crawl, R2 is to aim, L3 is to center view, X is to shoot, Square is to open up doors or take over machine guns, Triangle is to Jump, and O is to switch weapons. The lay out may sound easy but it takes some time to get used to.   In conclusion Medal of Honor is one of Playstation's best titles out there to date, and it is very well the best 1st person on the market. Mixing, the story of Saving Private Ryan, and the action of GoldenEye, Medal of Honor is truly one of the years best games ever. Even if you are not a fan of 1st person shooters, I still highly suggest buying Medal of Honor. 9.2 / 10	1
But...I have to say nothing is greater than a game that loads you up with good graphics, good gameplay, good everything and let's you go up against the Nazis as an agent in the OSS of world war II. If your a history buff or are too young to have seen world war two this gets you pretty close to the action. you go through missions fighting through and completing objectives. (duh). So buy this game and enjoy	1
This game is excellent!  If you are in need of a game to keep you busy and excited get Medal of Honor.  This game has decent graphics but the sound is awesome.  Music goes on while you nervously walk down pathways and German soldiers pop out from another pathway and blow you up with a bazooka.  The game is quite challenging.  It takes awhile to finish because as the game progresses the soldiers become very difficult to defeat because they think strategically.  Very good game!  Buy it as soon as possible.	1
This is by far the greatest video game I've ever played.  This is the first person shooter I've been waiting for.  You're not killing monsters and space aliens, you're actually particpating in historical events, killing real enemies.  The graphics are solid, and the sound is just awesome.  And with shock controllers, the "feel" of this game is just oustanding. I'm a big kid at heart, but no means am I a kid, so I can't keep up with many of today's games as they are too fast paced.  This game is challenging, but not impossible for an old timer like me.  The levels get increasingly difficult and offer enough of a varied experience to keep you addicted to the end.  A must have for anyone who enjoys video games and is a WWII buff.	1
Ok everybody this is the first serious WW2 game to come along, and it captivated America. From the scenes straight from saving private ryan to the sound that was almost erie this is an all around game. I personally own this game and can truly testify to the graphics, and personna that make up Medal of Honor. This game takes you beyond what you would expect from an aversge game, it takes you to the inner workings of the German war machine. You personally try to dismantle the nazis and try for the right of the Medal of Honor.	1
I bought this game when it first came out, and I had not heard one thing about it.  It was one of those impulse buys.  I didn't expect too much out of it, just something to do, but I was suprised.  This game is great.  I wouldn't say it's on the same level and Nintendo 007 series or Perfect Dark, but Medal of Honor was very fun.  A couple of the things that I think could have been different are features like shooting the German's helmet off.  It's kind of cool at first, but gets frustrating later.  Perhaps the biggest fault of the game was that it was a little too easy.  I like a challenge.  Althought I finished all of the levels fairly quick, I find myself going back and trying them again, especially after I watch war movies.	1
I think anyone who sees or plays this game even once will be hooked. Historical details are not usually high on the list of priorities when it comes to video game, in this one it obviously was. There are one and two  player modes. I enjoy both equally. High resolution Nazis try to blast you  back to the stone age, you are able to fight back with a large variety of  pistols, rifles, machine guns and explosives. The opponents have a  fantastic artificial intelligence and will do things like make soldiers  look over their shoulders when you walk by and attempt to throw or kick  back your grenades. You get a history lesson as your player (OSS agent  Jimmy Paterson) travels behind the lines in occupied Europe to destroy  German weapons of destruction. The sounds in the game are life like,  crickets and dogs at night, footsteps that get louder as people get closer,  spent bullet cases hitting the cobblestones, death screams. I can't say  enough for this game, I cross my fingers for a sequel and so will you if  you play it. Easily worth the price.	1
I don't like either of these as much as the newer Final Fantasy games (7 and 8), but they are still great games, if you missed Final Fantasy 3(6)  back on the SNES, you should pick it up now, plus you get Final Fantasy 5,  which was never released in the US before now.	1
The second to last WCW game proved that it had what it took to compete with the WWF (if only the TV show did as well).  Teh controls are very fluent, the matches (although needed variety) are fun.  This also holds a huge amount of wrestlers, and an ok create a wrestler.  The best part is that you can actually for the first time (in the WCW games) listen to the theme music before you made your guy (given up in WWF Smackdown) and they last longer than 5 seconds. The only real problem here is the create a wrestler, it's preety shallow and the move list is that of where you must pick another guys moves (I generally used either Sting, Goldberg, Nash, or Chris Benoit) and stick with that. I guess the real reason I love this game so much is the fact that it holds the best Theme Music to date.  My favorite theme Music (even though I am not a WCW fan) is the four horsemen.  That music is awsome. Overall this gasme is worth checking into, just avoid Thunder and Backstage assault.	1
Great series	1
Great Price And Game Thank You	1

Awesome game, arrived quickly!	1
Great game to play.	1
There's a reason these games are celebrating 30 years!  I've only got into the 1st game but had played the second before. Love the characters the gameplay is easy to follow and the storyline grabs you. A must for any ff fan!	1
Came at a perfect time and is brand new. Both games are fantastic and come in one great convenient package. This is a deal you cannot miss, especially for such a fantastic price. If you're a Final Fantasy or RPG fan, this is a must have.	1
Great buy	1
I needed this after my old copy broke on me, a solid 2 disc game with both Final Fantasy 5 and Final Fantasy 6 on it, two of the most biggest Final Fantasy games ever. I love Final Fantasy and this is a solid package worth buying!	1
Got here on time, case looks fine and game works great!	1

great	1
These are 2 great games! They arrived quickly and the condition was new as advertised. The front of the jewel case has a crack and the plastic pins that hold the second disc in place are almost entirely broken off but the discs play perfectly and are they aren't scratched. I'm very happy to add these games to my collection and excited to play them for the first time.	1
Final Fantasy 6 ( aka Final Fantasy 3 when it was first released in America back in the day ) Is one of my two favorite games of all time, Final Fantasy 4 ( aka Final Fantasy 2, when it was first released in the US ) being the other. Great purchase, worth it to play a game that's not all about crazy next gen graphics and over the top quick time events, just a fun game with great characters, story and atmosphere.	1
Two great Final Fantasy games for you to play on your PS1 or PS2. Came in great condition with manuals. Two of the best Square-Enix games ever made.. must play games for any RPG fan.	1
Made my oldest very very happy to receive this!	1
nice	1
Awesome! Thank you!!!!	1
Arrived fast and safe.	1
This was purchased for my grandsons and they love it.	1
great series	1
Remember my friends, final fantasy V is great, but you really need help on final fantasy VI because that is the hardest one to play.	1
Nostalgic.	1
THIS IS FOR FINAL FANTASY VI ONLY!!!!  Final Fantasy VI is perhaps one of my all time favorite final fantasy games in the franchise. If your a fan of FF, you MUST play this game, even if your not, its a great starting point. The game's visuals deliver a very original steampunk look, with an absolutely unprecedented degree of detail in the scenery, surpassed only by the same company's Chrono Trigger the following year. As a classic RPG, it really felt above and beyond the early titles before it regarding visual appeal. Musically, the game is also a delight. In what can be considered composer Nobuo Uematsu's best work of all time, each and every track of the game is a classic, delivering the best of what the system is capable of producing, everyone will tell you this games music sound tracks just ROCK!! Every single character has their own theme, some of which are used elsewhere in the game to signify a connection between the two. For example, Celes theme has major significance to the role she plays in the game. They are such full of nostalgia for many fans who have played it. Just listening to the tracks on youtube, personally for me memories just start flooding my mind of certain events in the game. The same of course can be said for Chrono trigger or Final Fantasy VII, both of these games have sound tracks that no other rpg can even come close to rivaling. My opinion.  The most positive aspect of Final Fantasy VI however is the story. Final Fantasy VI tackles a surprisingly large number of real world issues, the vast majority of which have not been addressed by any RPG before or since, ranging from suicide, political warfare, technology advances, pregnancy, economic downfall, romantic scenarios that are very deep. The degree of sophistication required to even mention these types of deep themes represented in a rpg is exceedingly rare for a game in the mid 90s.  Rather than focusing on a single character and a few side actors, Final Fantasy VI features a playable cast of over a dozen characters, nearly all of whom receive a great deal of development, and none of whom truly receive the lion's share of the focus. Something that I have always found bothersome in a lot of rpgs or anime for that matter, where most of the focus is on one particular character and the story is centered around that character, whereas final fantasy VI kind of has much attention and greater focus on each individual character, although there are some characters that play very little rolls, but they are mostly optional characters and not really considered part of the main cast like Mimic for example.  Not only does "Final Fantasy VI" have the biggest cast of playable characters in any Final Fantasy, also one of the best. Almost each character gets a good deal of background story and development, to an extent that one could say that there is no real main character, Locke and Terra could fit the bill as well as others like Celes, Edgar, or Cyan. Its no surprise that they have an almost legendary status among fans by now, and its highly likely that each of them will grow close to you over the time youll actually worry about their well being and their story. Especially the second half of the game gives you an amount of freedom in terms of character development that is rarely seen in any RPG, but I won't spoil it for you, just as I won't spoil any other details about the story for those who haven't played it yet.  Nevertheless, its still one of the greatest stories ever told in any RPG, and the villain of this game, Kefka deserves a special mention for being the most lunatic villain in any RPG, surpassing even Albedo from Xenosaga at least in that regard.  The gameplay is pretty traditional fanfare as most of the classical rpgs from this era, you get the typical Active time based combat system, but if you played this game before I really don't have to go into it that much. The game has not lost any of its appeal at all, and its still one of the best games ever made, an all-time classic and one of the most memorable video game experiences ever. In fact I might just go play this one now :p It has been to long.	1
Super grate!!!!!!! Never played this game b4 can't wate to get further into it.	1
Amazing package! Final Fantasy is awesome and FF6 is one of the best games ever made. Ever	1

Fast Shipping, Product as described	1
It's wonderful being able to revisit some of my favorite JRPGs from the 16-bit generation!	1
One star off for load times	1
I love it ^_^	1
yea...i love it and thanks.	1
As with the Final Fantasy Origins disc for sale through Amazon, this is a bootleg disc. It contains silver backed discs versus trademark original black PlayStation discs. I should have known better for the price and condition. These are considered some of the greatest Final Fantasy titles for crying out loud!  Everything still works. The case is complete with (bootlegged) manual, and the games play fine in my OG PSX console, but I didn't want no dirty, illegal software when I paid for this so it gets one star.  Do yourself a favor and get a good used copy, but be careful, these pirated copies have proliferated Amazon's used store and eBay.  Look for the Squaresoft logo and black discs!!  Amazon, you need to pull these from your storefront!!!!	-1
Exactly what you think	1
I am a purist.  I like the original theatrical release of Star Wars. I keep my cars stock. I turn off "audio enhancements" and "video enhancements" on my TV/audio setup.  I really wish these games didn't have the added features, but I also didn't want to track down a working used copy of FF6.  I removed a star for that.  Loading times are a little slower.  I noticed that these PS1 discs don't have the typical black coating.	1
Sweet Combination	1
Great condition , haven't played 5 yet , started 6 and it reminds me of my old super NES . Can't wait to expand my collection more.	1
Good	1
I WAS A BIG FAN OF THE SERIES - UNTIL THEY GOT REALLY CHEESY EPISODES. BUT MAY GO BACK TO IT NOW THAT IT'S ON IT'S LAST SEASON. BUT I LOVE THIS GAME !! SURE THE GRAPHICS AREN'T THE BEST , BUT THE GAMEPLAY IS AWESOME !! IF YOU USE ONE MOVE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIMES - YOU HEAL YOURSELF. PLUS KILLING ENEMIES WITH HER CHAKRAM IS SHEER PLEASURE !! NOT TO MENTION ALL THE COOL MONSTERS TO DO BATTLE WITH ! THERE ARE MANY MYTHICAL GREEK MONSTERS SCATTERED THRU THIS GAME AS WELL... LIKE THE''CYCLOPS'' '' MEDUSA'' AND THE ''MINOTAUR''.. AS WELL AS SOME ''SKELETONS ''  ''HARPIES''  ''STONE GOLEMS'' AND OF COURSE PLENTY OF SOLDIERS , RUFFIANS, AND AMAZONS. AND DON'T FORGET THE EVIL WIZARDS AS WELL... THERE ARE MANY CHALLENGES TO KEEP YOU COMING BACK FOR MORE !!! SO PICK UP THE ULTIMATE FIGHTING ADVENTURE GAME OF ALL TIME , AND BATTLE ON !!	1
Great Game, one of the best Final Fantasy re-releases on the system. You owe it to yourself to grab this and play through Final Fantasy 6, having FF5 is really just a bonus.	1
Thanks	1
Before I bought AC I was interested in Ultima 9 which was a complete flop. Then, my brother had me play AC and one of the biggest things you notice are the graphics. Just clicking on the Life stone which saves where you will be teleport to is beautiful. All the magic is fun and most of the people are great. I recommend a video card that can support the modest graphic requirement. I think the ten dollar fee is accurate since the great people at turbin always update the game each month with new world events and climate to new armour, weapons, quests, and new lands. All of which you would have to pay for a new game completely anyways. But, with AC you never have to buy a new game because AC is always a new game each month =) I recommend this game if you want to be addicted I have been playing for 1 1/2 years and I don't plan on buying anything else until AC2 Thanks Turbin for a game you spent making for around  6 years I believe.	1
Classic Final Fantasy Games remastered and getting hard to find.	1
Good	1
Another great set	1
These are some of my favorite games. I'm happy to add it to the collection and look foreward to playing it again.	1
My son loved that he can still get game for his playstation one in good shape at a good price.	1
Great games looking forever for these out in the open but i guess most people are holding on to them glad to get them brand new tho i know its taboo i opened them it felt great having brand new disc to play again its been awhile since i had a truly new ps1 game	1
This item arrived in good shape and in good time. I haven't had a chance to play it yet, but am looking forward to it!	1
Love the game thanks! This game is great from the look and the level of detail and the combat. Thanks	1
Asheron's Call is a basic RPG played online. You create your character from three different races of humans (basically English, Arabian or Japanese) and then assign skills and stats to customize your character. And then you're launched into the world of Asheron's Call. The first thing that strikes you is the scale of the game. It's huge. The second thing is the unavoidable question: What do I do know? Now here's what I did: After entering the game I wandered around for an hour or two trying to make scense of it all. I was then asked by another player if I wanted to swear allegiance to him (which meant that he would be my patron and help me get started with my char.). So I then followed my patron around for a few hours and did what he told me to do. I killed a lot of monsters and was given a lot of equipment. This quickly became boring and I quit playing and traded the game in at my local games store for a copy of "Sacrifice" (which was much more exciting). The main problem with an online RPG is, in my opinion, the lack of meaning or a goal. At least in the beginning. You just wander around and kill things. There's no quests. There's no nothing. Just wandering around in this huge (note: to get an idea of how huge it really is, read Douglas Adam's description of infinity in "The Hitchiker's Guide To The Galaxy") world. Another things that really bothers me, is the fact that you have to pay a monthly fee ($... in this case) to play a game you initially paid a fair sum of money for (in my case, $...). Why is this? I'm sure there are some expences in keeping the servers going, but not $... a month for each player. On Microsoft's webpages, it said that there were over 200k people playing the game. Multiply that number by $... and you get the staggering amount of $... a month (no way it costs that much to maintain the servers). Capitalism rules, I guess.	-1
I've played the top 3 online multiplayer games (top 3 in popularity based on online subscriptions): Ultima Online, Everquest and Asheron's Call. Let me tell you that I have enjoyed this title (AC) more than the other two combined. For one thing, I never quite agreed with Ultima Online's system of player killing.  For those of you not familiar with this term, that means that any "Joe Bob" on the internet can kill your character as soon as he/she leaves a town.  It doesn't make the game any fun especially when you consider how many kids out there play this game and have nothing better to do than player kill all day long. Although I didn't play Everquest as much as the other two titles, I found the entire system to be lacking.  The controls and console didn't seem to flow as much as Asheron's Call and Ultima Online.  Furthermore, while the game has better graphics than the other two titles, it didn't feel "3-D."  It had a still feel to it and didn't provide much 3-D stimulation. Of the three, I have spent more time on Asheron's Call and found it's monthly subscription worth it.  Every two months, new scenarios, items and quests are added to the game.  They have done fun scenarios such as adding a creature with "god" statistics and having an AC programmer control it and wreak havoc in the world. Creative stuff such as snow during the winter (real time) and "killer snowmen".  The 3-D view that one witnesses while playing the game is impressive.  You can stand on a cliff in the middle of nowhere and view the horizon. Asheron's Call does a great job in meeting the demands of the game.  For instance, if a gliche is found that allows players to take advantage of certain rules, it is fixed in the next patch.  If the world is becoming too simple for players, more powerful creatures are added.  There are so many good things I have to say about AC (Asheron's Call), I would waste your time typing them. :) This is the best online multiplayer game out there, make no mistake about it.	1
Even though this game has a HUGE map, great graphics, and everything you need to make the perfect RPG, it still stinks. I know this may sound crazy but it really isint. The main problem is combat. You select where you want to attack (high, medium, or low) and the computer does the rest. Also you have to pay 10.00 a month to play it. There are many other reasons why this game is absolutely no fun to play but trust me it is no fun at all. Remember, great graphics does not make a game, gameplay does.	-1
It came on time, in Perfect condition. Huge Xena fan and I have been wanting this game for years. The best Christmas gift i got myself this year.  *side note to people looking to buy this game the characters are boxy and pointy....that's all old play station games. It is still an Awesome game	1
Ok, yes the graphics are dated (old school PS1), but so far the story and voice acting are great. And YES it does work on the PS3. Enjoy!	1
These release was the first time the US had a localized version of Final Fantasy V. Final Fantasy VI was and still is a masterpiece.	1
I am not too picky on the best versions for these 2 titles. Purists alike will say to avoid this one but I did not mind. There are, however, some precautions regarding these games. 1.) translation, 2.) loading times, 3.) bugs.	1
Final Fantasy V & VI is a great re-visit for fans of the series or anyone playing it for the first time. Hard to believe how far this series has come in the past 20 years! Then again, when you can go back, play the older ones, & still enjoy it... It's not so hard to believe after all.	1
Great game, the graphics are good, the music too, and the gameplay is awesome, i recommend to everybody, buy this game !!!	1
Well I love Final Fantasy V and the job system.  Final Fantasy VI was not my cup of tea, but still good.	1
This game contains two classic Final Fantasy games. Easy to play and a lot of fun also. See the games that led up to the current Final Fantasy series.	1
Seeing as I had FFI-III on handhelds and FFVII-FFX on playstation 1 and 2. I was looking to flesh out the rest of them.	1
This is a great buy for fans of the Final Fantasy Series. It contains two games in one release.  Although the graphics for these games have been improved upon a little bit do not expect modern graphics by any means.  Final Fantasy V:  This was the first time Final Fantasy V was released in the US.  For the time it was released (1992), Final Fantasy has amazing graphics.  The story is fun and involving.  The game was also very innovative when it came to the class change system and overall game mechanics.  I would recommend this game to anyone that is into into Sci-Fi, Fantasy and RPGs.  Final Fantasy VI: This was first released in the US as Final Fantasy III for the SNES.  This was probably one of the most advances RPGs for its time.  The graphics were absolutely amazing compared to anything that was released on the SNES at the time. Final Fantasy VI has an extremely involving and well thought out story with many plot twists and a lot of likeable and well defined characters.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone that is into Sci-Fi, Fantasy and RPGs.	1
Okay, here it is in a nutshell.  The graphics bite, and bite HARD.  The spell component system is so difficult that playing hack and slash by default is much more preferable.  And there is little if any help by the  GMs.  My two cents.  Buy at your own risk.	-1
I bought it for a friend and watched him play it and it looked like something I would have fun playing.  I would like to thank the seller.  I'd recommend this game to anybody who watched Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and/or Xena: Warrior Princess.	1
im going to rebuy it when i have the chance i didn't beat it yet good action... u get to use a good different amount of weapons i remember .. the cutscenes are pretty good .. and u can actually play two player on it when u get to the board with gabriella and she is helping u fight just plug in another controller and ur friend can play with u during the part u are fighting the minostuars only though	1
Before I begin, I am big fan of the franchise.  Game play and graphics The game play is old fashioned, graphics are SNES style. RPG style game One of the most difficult Final Fantasy games I have ever played.	1
I rate this product five stars because it works properly and it's just what I wanted. I like this product because I'm a huge fan of Final Fantasy video game series, and I would recommend this to any rpg gamer.	1
FFV features a lone traveller, a princess in search of her father, an amnesiac old man, and a pirate captain, all of whom are called forth to defend the world from the destruction of the crystals of water, wind, fire and earth.  The biggest feature in this game is the job system-you can customize your character's job through gaining experience in each field.  For instance, I have a monk trained with the Knight's "Cover" technique, and a mage trained equally high in both white and black magic.  While complaints that the story is transparent and childish do not go unfounded, the gameplay itself is entertaining enough to make up for that.  Pros: +Monster battles, while common, are not so frequent that playing this becomes a chore in itself. +The job system is fun to play with +The characters are interesting and entertaining +Boss fights are challenging, but not impossible.  Cons: -The story, as previously stated, is very basic at times.  It is deeper than FFX-2, yet not as deep as FFX. -You are restricted to 1 alternate ability; this becomes very confining at times. -As with most earlier FF games, instruction tends to be rare, if present at all.  (I have not played FFVI enough to make a judgement on it.)	1
Great game, now I have Final Fantasy I, II, V-X. i just need III and IV. But this game itself with V and VI on separate discs is quite the adventure, I haven't gotten too deep into it, but it seems any avid FF fan will love to add this to their collection.	1
Well if it is anything like FF2, I might not play them, I liked FF1 and FF2 but they are too simple for me to finsih	-1
After countless hours of frustration and disappointment with Ultima Online and EverQuest (although UO still retains a great deal of potential), Asheron's Call was a great relief. One of the best features is that the  monsters aren't "typical" sword 'n sorcery fare. In other words,  don't come looking for orcs, goblins, giants, etc. While the bestiary of AC  obviously derives from these fantasy fiction archetypes, it develops them  differently, adding to the strong sense that one is truly in an  "unknown world." AC is a bit quiet as far as ambient sound  goes. Honestly, I like that. I usually listen to music while playing and  this arrangement suits me just fine (and for any veterans of EverQuest,  it's certainly nice to not dream about that incessant and irritating gnoll  barking). The graphics are a bit basic, but again, I find that a likeable  feature. And if nothing else, it shows that the game developers and  programmers are more concerned about the FUNCTIONALITY of the game than the  appearance. However, the environment (and most especially the night sky)  are detailed and quite stunning in their own right. This MMORPG is also  excellent for the casual player (such as myself). Other games requiring  endless hours of sitting, practicing skills, fighting, etc in order to make  the smallest headway. AC's rewards are more commensurate with one's  efforts, and those rewards are satisfying. AC is admittedly not for the  power gaming types, although they are there. Since I'm not a power gamer, I  feel more comfortable with the people online there and have a much better  online role-playing experience.	1
...And when they say massively multiplayer, they aren't kidding! (On a busy night, there are about 7,600 people on Dereth... and this is before Christmas!) The Character Generation is fabulous.  Not only do you get to give your character specific skills and abilities to surivive on this  foreign planet, but you get to customize their appearence.  From skin color  and eye shape, to haircut and clothing. Once you are in Dereth, you can  bash monsters or just hang around towns. There are some players who have  never left their hometown and still gain expereince and money. You can  chat with other players and team up to dispatch baddies, or go solo  adventuring.  The game works equally well for teams and solos. Some  dungeons are geared specifically for solos, some for teams... but it's up  to you to discover which is which. The game interface is very intuitive  and easy-to-learn. With a simple click of the mouse, you go from pleasant  chat to battle mode. Choose hand-to-hand combat, ranged weapons, or cast  magic. Unlike so many other online RPGs, Asheron's Call has a PLOT.  YES,  there are goals, events, quests... PLUS, the team at Turbine pops in and  throws "spur of the moment" events at the players. (Ask any of us  old-timers about the Tremendous Monogua!) If you do get this game, be warned:  You will spend many  hours in front of your PC playing!  It is the "enemy of  responsibility"! Signed:  Quinn Crowfire of Thistledown	1
I don't play video games much but I have some of the clasics. For any RPG fan this is a must have especially if you like the old school  1 and 2D types of layouts. Colorful and simple but not as simple as say Mystic Quest the baby RPG of yesterday decade. Great gift as well.	1
Thanks of final fantasy product give a series of game that kid enjoy for hours in a different kind of word	1
not bad for the price. i'm not a huge fan of the lag during the loading screens but as far as the price goes this is a great way to spend some hours.	1
This game should have NEVER been released in its current state. Its load times are unacceptable. Both games feel like chores playing because of how long everything takes due to very poor emulation. Squaresoft wanted to make as much money as they could with the game without having to spend any money to hire someone who could make the game work properly with the PS1. This is an extremely bad port of FF5 and FF6. FF5 freezes very often when you try to save. Also its load times are long. Not to mention this is the original translation of the game, so be prepared to have a certain character talk like a drunken brain damaged pirate the entire game. FF5 just butchers the English language. FF6 is the same as it was on SNES except for extremely long load times. It becomes a chore trying to open the menu to heal your character or whatever. The long load times really take away from the games and just makes the whole thing a bad experience. Stick to the SNES or get these games on gameboy advance. Also FF5 is exactly the same on PSN as it was in anthology. LONG LONG load times as well as being incompatible with your PS3 half the time. Shame on you square soft, shame.	-1
When EA sports got the rights to WCW I guess they thought about how to do it, do they go with the way THQ did it, or the way ACCLIAM would? They seemed to be able to make a graphic that is in between both designs! It's kind of the THQ game play with WWF Attitudes graphics in a way. The graphics of the wrestlers and motion in this game look like Attitudes style only they look stupid, each character looks like a big head on a small body with skinnier legs, they look like they are going to start hopping around the ring like a rabbit or a kangaroo or something.  The game has so many flaw...  - No costume change for any wrestler. - Cant edit wrestlers - Created wrestlers cannot have there moves chosen individually. You have to select a pre programmed set of moves from one of the existing wrestlers in the game. And you cant even select a different finishing move which is stupid because it shows an option to change it but if you change it to say the Jacknife Powerbomb then it will change the previous move list to that of Kevin Nash. - Too many moves are wrong, not done right, given to the wrong wrestler ect and high flyers like Rey Mysterio don't have off the rope moves or anything, there basically grounded. or moves are missing, hogans leg drop is not a finisher, Nash doesnt do that size up thing in the corner, scott hall has no choke slam, lex luger has no torture rack, sting does headscissors, but its the wrong headscissors, he does a cruiserweight one instead of the regular one, randy savage doesnt raise his arms on the top rope elbow, god knows what else is missing. - Moves just become repeated and it gets boring. Every charactor feels about the same to control. - It sucks to only be able to hit your opponent with a weapon 2 or 3 times before they block it (every time, no joke) the weapons don't consist much more then chairs and bats. - Going backstage is nothing special. 4 weapons and nowhere to go but back to ring side. - The codes are annoying to have to put in up to 15 digit codes every time you wanna access it - meaning you have to put them in each match, then once you finish you have to put them in again. - There has been little attention payed by the creators to the background. - Everything is too programmed. You figure out right away that eventually you can hit your opponent twice on the ground before they get up and finishing moves don't mean your opponent will stay down like they should. I did a 3-way match and dropped about a million diamond cutters on them and they get up right away. - Only one special move for each wrestler. And all are done the same way in a grapple, which means wrestlers like Bret Hart and Stings Sharpshooter are not there finishers! - You can only select about 5 tunes for a CAW's ring music. - The entrances are very dodgy. - The commentary becomes VERY annoying after you've heard it repeated 1000 times in the one match. - CAW can't choose attires from the other wrestlers, or a moustache like Hogan to make a CAW version of the yellow and red Hogan. - A lot of moves are missing; Booker T's axe kick finisher thing, Bret Harts 'hart attack', double team moves, ways to turn your opponent around to grabble them from behind, Hogan's big boot, there is only one pin unless it's a move - not one of them hooks the leg or anything unless it's a move given to them, taunts are missing, entrance taunts are wrong or missing. - It's another game that has completely ignored Hulk Hogan's Leg Drop as being a devastating finisher, it's simply just a running leg drop that doesn't even look like the height Hogan would do it from and I don't know if I've ever seen Hogan pull off a standing drop kick before. It's just an average leg drop with little damage. - all the backstage rooms are the same, there just a diffrent picture on the walls which is boring. - Goldberg's not only in the game, but also on the damn cover. And finally, it's WCW.  My recommendation is WWF NO MERCY. However the WCW fan may prefer WCW/NWO Revenge. THQ made the better wrasslin' games on the 64. Stick with them.  ==================================================== Codes to try and make this game a bit better (although you have to enter them each time    CODE  RESULT   CBCKRMS  - ALL BACKROOMS   PLYHDNGYS  - ALL HIDDEN WRESTLERS   CHT4DBST  - Q.

I hated WCW Mayhem for a lot of reasons. One, way too much production level was spent on making the characters look good and they still looked awful. The Create A Wrestler was a total pain. Why? Because if you picked certain items of clothing for a wrestler, it didn't match and he looked stupid. Honestly, if you picked Nash's pants, you either had to be skins on top or wear his tank top as well because nothing else matched or looked right. That and you didn't get to pick any of their moves. Again, another F- for effort. Basically all you did was create a new non-matching-outfit-having wrestler with someone else's moves. Bad. Very bad. So bad that's why WWF Warzone never did that type of Create a Wrestler ever again. And not saying that WWF Attitude was the heart stopping game that it was supposed to be, but at least they learned their lesson and never did that type of Create a Wrestler option. The grappling totally ate. I was basically kicking, punching and occassionally jumping off the top rope in an attempt to win. I could not get the grapping. It was seriously that bad. Every now and then, I'd pull off a little something, but after that one time, I could never replicate the move. Again another G- for effort (the grading was so low that I couldn't even give it an F because it was that bad). I wouldn't waste time or money on this title. I still think the better N64 wrestling game was WCW/NWO or WCW Revenge. If you really want to play this bad attempt, then go ahead but I won't be responsible when after you play it, realize that it WAS THAT BAD and throw it out the window.	-1
Not even owning a Game Shark can make this game fun. Without it, you have to drop an elbow on your opponent 967 times to get the pin. With a Game Shark, a mere 960 times. All jokes aside, gameplay is extremely slow and irritating. In the time it takes to execute one complicated move, I could have made a hero sandwich, grabbed another drink, and went to the mens room. Controller response is so slow, it feels as if someone spilled a soda on your controller last week. I like what one reviewer said about the punches taking 3 hours to deliver. I couldn't stop laughing when I read that. By the way, I sold my WCW Mayhem game at my last yard sale, for $2. And that, people, IS TRUE.	-1
WCW STINKS. At least that's what most WWF, ECW, and other wrestling fans believe, and from the looks of this game, they're right. The only fun thing about this game is the 4-man battle royal. Everything else, the character designs, the entrances, the bizarre physics of contact (I punch while you're a mile away; you feel it) just smell worse than... Santa after a rowdy elf party. Stay away from this game... it gets one star for the battle royal, and the other for just booting up when you turn it on. Go buy Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.	-1
I think that the review at the top of this game has it right -- not enough questions.  Also, the $100 through $1000 questions are too hard (compared to the TV show). Another annoying feature is the inability to skip past stuff that you have seen a million times, that is redundant to you. I bought this game out of boredom, and I think that I paid about $... for it.  If you like the TV show, then don't pay any more than that.  But, if you see it on the rack real cheap, then hey, pick it up.	-1
Believe me, I would give this game zero stars if Amazon.com allowed me. I received this for Christmas as a gift and let me tell you.  This is possibly the worst piece of garbage put on the market.  I mean, the questions run out fast leaving the game to replay old questions which are easy once you get to know them which means the replay value isn't very high.  If you want a fun game try the Sims or Delta Force: Landwarrior.  Your time would be better spent with those games .	-1
Would have a good review if the developers spent more than five minutes slapping this together.  By the second or third time through the questions were already repeating themselves - awful!  Plus multiplayer is just a "fastest-finger" question to determine who plays solo.  Big deal! The worst part is the game only runs about two or three times before it crashes on startup.  This is on an Intel PC with name-brand components, no cheap swap-meet stuff.  The only solution has been to uninstall and reinstall the game.  A visit to the Disney Interactive site for tech support... umm where is it?  Because of this I can't recommend anyone purchase this game. They've come out with a second edition of this game (wow, so quick?)  Perhaps this version works?	-1
Man, I never knew Phil Regis could be this ANNOYING!  Since some of the first few questions are ludicrously hard (which is totally unlike the show), and it gives you 30 seconds to answer the question (which is ALSO  totally unlike the show), I have to restart the game A LOT, which means I  hear Phil Regis A LOT.  A "skip" button should've been put into  the game!  I haven't recieved any repeat questions after about 3 months of  owning the game.  How?  I uninstalled it after 30 minutes and never played  it again!  Trust me, you'd get more fun out of an electronic whoopee  cushion than this game...and it's $5 cheaper!	-1
As others have mentioned, this product has serious flaws--especially with regard to the pitiful number of questions available.  For me, however, a larger complaint is the surprising unfaithfulness to the show. The  so-called "Fastest Finger" questions are nothing really like  those on the show.  You don't compete to put the answers in the right  order; you just buzz in when the computer flashes up the proper  arrangement.  It's related to the set of skills necessary on the real  show--but it's not the same. Likewise, when answering questions in the  "hot seat", you don't really get the "Is that your final  answer?" prompting in a consistent way.  Only some of the questions  allow for it. Also, the questions in the pre-$1000 range are unusually  difficult, compared with the show. There, they're ridiculously easy,  complete with flatly idiotic possible answers.  Here, by contrast, the  early questions are much more serious.  They're still comparatively easy,  but they're not the gimmes they are on the real show. Hopefully, the  producers will have found a way to be more faithful to the show--and give  us more questions--for the second edition of this game.	-1
This is the most meager cash-in attempt I've ever seen. There may well be hundreds of questions, but it'll take you a thousand games to see them all. I was receiving a couple or three repeat questions by the fifth game, and a  majority of repeats by game 10. There seems to be little or no gradual  increase in difficulty, which was proven when I saw a $500 question later  repeated as a $125,000 question later in the game. An example of the  game's inadequacy runs thusly: I am cruising through the game easily until  the $32,000. Fine, by now I'm expecting them to be tough. I use the 50-50,  then the call a friend, who says she is 75% certain the answer is (A). Just  to be sure, I use the audience poll as well. Guess what, 92% say that (A)  is their choice. Well, now I'm convinced and go with (A) as well. I'm  WRONG, it's (B). That is just stupid beyond measure. If they wanted to  throw me off, make the audience rating more like 60-40% or  something. Nice graphics, nice sounds, atrocious game mechanics. Wait for  the improved version, or play it on the net.	-1
Holy fat mama! This game was the most hideous thing I have ever played.  Not only is it easier than the TV show, its twice as dumb!  The first and second questions I was asked the first time I played were the same stinkin'  question.  From the third game on, I never went without a repeat question.  You should stay away from this.  It will probably eventually drive you  insane by the low-fi sound clip of Regis saying "Final Answer?"  anyways.  Try some of the not-as-pathetic games by eXpert software.  Such  as extreme paintball, deer hunter, and other quickly thrown together  titles.  It gets a second star for being functional (barely)	-1
As a big fan of the TV show, I was really looking forward to the home version, and undoubtedly so were thousands of other fans.  Unfortunately, the folks at Disney and Jellyvision were clearly aware of that, and the  rush was obviously on to get this game to market as soon as possible,  before the craze could die down.  The result is a game that doesn't come  close to matching either the TV show or Jellyvision's previous  efforts. The most obvious problem is the limited number of questions.  This problem is greatly compounded by the fact that the game doesn't seem  to make note of which questions have already been asked--a simply  inexcusable error, which results in repeated questions after only a few  games. The box proudly touts the fact that a "virtual Regis"  hosts the game; and sure enough, he's there.  But his involvement in the  project was clearly limited; he doesn't read any of the questions, only  providing the pre- and post-question patter.  That's understandable, given  the amount of money that Regis would have probably demanded for such a  large recording job; but it does greatly diminish the illusion of being on  the show. The game's incorrect pacing destroys the rest of that illusion.  Instead of encouraging the player to take his/her time as the show does, a  30-second clock is inexplicably added.  And while the game rushes you  through the questions themselves, it needlessly slows down between them.  Since the designers couldn't have Regis read the questions, they clearly  wanted to maximize his involvement between questions; so the game stops  after every question while Regis delivers one of a set of long canned  remarks.  This is tolerable later in the game, but it comes across as  simply silly during the first few easy questions that the TV show would  blast through in short order. As others have pointed out, even the  keyboard commands have problems.  Assigning a lifeline to the same key as  an answer choice is begging for mistakes; and the lack of an "Is that  your final answer?" question in most cases further increases the  possibility of errors, as well as erasing the remainder of the feel of  being on the show. The game does have its moments; if multiple people are  playing, a clever implementation of the fastest-finger round decides who  gets to sit in the hot seat.  But frankly, I can't imagine playing this as  a multi-player game anyway; the show's format simply isn't suited to be a  party game, and this home version simply isn't exciting enough to  watch. In summary, the Millionaire computer game has its (brief) moments,  but simply isn't worth even the low price Disney is asking for it.  It's  unfortunate that Disney and Jellyvision chose to put their names--and the  show's reputation--on such a disappointing effort.	-1
I have to admit that I never was a victim of the "Tomb Raider Hype Machine". I liked the idea of a 3rd person perspective game where your character can do alot of tricks but the whole idea of the big-boobed Lara Croft just turned me off.  I bought this for 4 bucks at the used software house and played it for about 2 hours. I liked the save game feature somewhat, it should be more specific. I felt like banging my head against a wall after be killed for the 50th time because I didn't hit the "jump" button in the right sequence with the "run" button at the correct prescribed time.  The interface is just too rigid for a game like this, it reminded me alot of that old "Dragon's Lair" game. And I got real tired of the stupid puzzles.  I think the real reason for TR being so popular is that its the first non-adult game with a overly-endowed female protagonist. It can't be because of the gameplay.	-1
I could not play it as it did not want to be downloaded on either a 98 windows or an ME windows so beware as you could be out of pocket money and not be able to use it.  the saving grace I didn't pay much for it.	-1
Wow, I expected something decent when I bought this at my local Half-Price Books store, (I was on a Mortal Kombat Craze, hell I even bought MK:Annihilation at the same place on dvd) BUT THIS IS GOD AWFUL!!!  The Presentation is terrible! You only have a Choice of 6 characters. Scorpion, Kano, Liu Kang, Raiden, Sub-Zero, Sonya. No Johnny Cage. The Game itself is just a 10 fighter tournament. About 6 fights of the same thing. then last 3 is Endurance rounds (aka tag team fighters) Then Goro fight where Goro just gropes you, then Shang Tsung fight. THE END. Enter your name, turn off game, Rethink the past hour of your life, turn back on, name is not saved on leaderboard, OUT OF THIS HOUSE, OUT OF THIS HOUSE!  The Controls make me wish I was playing Shaq Fu! Im dead serious. Its incredibly sluggish! Every single button command has to be inputed slowly. To execute special moves, like scorpions's spear, heres how you input it:  Back, (1 sec pause), Back, (1 sec pause), B.  Don't try and speed-run this game.  The music is just an abomination, take a listen: [...] [...]  Overall, don't waste any money on this. If you decide to buy this, pick up some pepto-bismo on your way back to the grocery store. Or just get an SNES or Arcade emulator if you want to play the real MK1.	-1
The game boy port of Mortal Kombat was just awful! The music and graphics were decent,but the gameplay was super slow,there was absolutley NO blood OR sweat like in the SNES version,and the fatalities were just dumb. Another bad thing,for ME anyway,was there is no Johnny Cage in this version,who was one of my favorite characters from the first game. The only good MK game for game boy was MK II.Just pass this one up. It sucks.	-1
Mortal Kombat dominated arcades and home consoles worldwide, but did it dominate handhelds? No. No it did not. The Game Gear version was fairly good, but the Game Boy port suffered from really slow gameplay, dull music, and no sound effects. The graphics were okay, but it didn't help keep the Game Boy version from getting a fatality.  This is possibly the worst Mortal Kombat game.	-1
As we all know the point of this game is to get the frog from point A to point B without getting killed by cars or water. The game has good graphics but there are some things I did not like. For example I didn't like the fact that on level three on the game it was impossible to avoid the super fast cars and throughout the whole game you are times. Anyway only if you love frogger get this game.	-1
I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop, and I had played Mario Land 2 in the past, which was excellent, but this game is bad. I'm sure it's not the worst Mario game out there, but it's the worst one I've played. It's not a horrible game, but it's just not as good as its predecessors or its successors. The biggest complaint I have are the controls and the physics. It doesn't even feel like a Mario game. The controls are klunky and often unresponsive, the physics are weird, like the Fire Flower's Fireball. It ricochets everywhere before eventually going out. The enemies are unlike anything I've ever seen in Mario. In one world, you have to Easter Island Heads with arms and legs, kinda like Nosepass from Pokemon. The Koopas explode when you jump on them. I don't mean they explode and die, i mean, when you jump on them, they go into their shell, and explode like a Bob-Omb, hurting you if you're too close. The graphics, I can't give TOO much flack to because it IS gameboy, but it doesn't look much better than the Mario Calculator games I played back in highschool. I'd say skip this one, go straight to Mario 2. It's much MUCH better.	-1
Eternal Champions is an awesome game....for Sega CD.This version of it for Genesis is total crap. First of all,the game is almost IMPOSSIBLE to beat. You'll have one hell of a time just getting past the first fight. What makes it even worse is there is no way to adjust the difficulty level on this game neither. Another bad thing about this stinker is when you lose a match,you gotta keep hitting reset over and over again if you wanna change your fighter. This game sucks. There IS some history behind this game though. This was the very first exclusive fighting game that went straight to Genesis,and that wasn't in the arcade first. But that little history lesson doesn't save this terrible game. Oh and did I mention that you need a six button controller to play this game too?...You can play it with a three button pad,if you like to keep hitting the start button over and over again to change your punches into kicks. My best advice to you is to stay as far away from this game as you can,and pick up the Sega CD version of it.	-1
This game is the worst fighting game ever. You have to press start to change from punch to kick, the players are original, but just damn dumb, and the game is hard. You will be lucky enough to even pass the first person. The graphics are ok, but it's horrendous mechanics destroys any hope for this game, and you can't even change your character if you loose, so that forces you to hit the reset button every time you want to change characters.	-1
This game falls short with so many other console fighting games. It has cool characters and stages,moves but not enough of these aspects to make the game shine. Thats exactly why I highly recommend the Sega CD game Eternal Champions:Challenge From The Darkside it has all the characters,moves,overkills that this 16 bit cart does and a whole lot more. In the Sega CD sequel the player has 4 brillant ways to end a match not just the one you get with the genesis game. The Sega CD version has overkills which is in this game ,but in addition has cinekills(a cinema scene where you brutally dispose of the opponent)Vendettas(where each character has a unique way to let out his/her revenge),and Sudden Deaths(another background finisher like overkills except they are harder to pull off and ends the round quicker)and tons of characters I believe 38-40 with not palette swaps like the ... Mortal Kombat series. BOTTOM LINE I GIVE ETERNAL CHAMPIONS CREDIT FOR BEING MADE TO SPAWN THE WONDERFUL SEGA CD GAME,WHICH I WOULD RECOMEND OVER THIS ANY DAY!	-1
This game seems like it was thrown together to keep as much speed as possible. Back in the early 90s Genesis was the blistering fast system. As per the SEGA gargon. Truth is it was slghtly faster then SNES but couldn't handle the colors. So now was know why they left over half the colors of the orginial. Now we are stock with this thing. They kept most of the moves and all the colors, but doesn't have any intro or ending animation which means it looks half done. Before you defend this game, think of this. Super Street Fighter looked great, but they they just didn't take the time porting this game. And much like Mortal Kombat it looks drab, choppy, and well peiced together.   On the other hand if you are a collector and you want a PR port check out 32X. It is one of the best ports out there. This is one of the most ported games of all time, and the Genesis is one of the ones to try to see how much they took out and how bad it was.	-1
Looks and plays nothing like PC or arcade version and the moves are too complicated.  Get MK instead. Terrible.	-1
THIS IS THE VERSION OF MORTAL KOMBAT 3 THAT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY AVOID. THIS GAME WAS HORRIBLE AND IT MAKES THE SUPER NINTENDO VERSION LOOK LIKE A GOOD GAME IN COMPARISON. THE GRAPHICS ARE AWFUL, THE MUSIC IS ANNOYING HERE, THE CONTROLS ARE BAD, AND UNLESS YOU HAVE A 6 BUTTON CONTROLLER FOR THE SEGA GENESIS, YOU CAN'T DO MUCH OF ANYTHING!!! THIS IS A MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT TO THOSE THAT HAVE THIS GAME ON GENESIS. AVOID THIS VERSION AT ALL COSTS. THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. THIS VERSION JUST RUINS THIS SOMEWHAT DECENT SEQUEL.	-1
I like the original Batman game for this system as oppose to this joke. The graphics are very good I will say that, but terrible gameplay. The fighting system in this game was different and it was more than just a rock'em sock'em still side scroller. I liked how each of the characters had a huge list of moves; and how you can use them in the dual mode. Despite this being a bad game overrall I remember myself and my brother loved playing this game back in the day. It was cool when I was a pre-teen but now its just one of those stale games.	-1
batman forever is Mortal kombat rebuilt for batman. they put MK's controls and suk random bat gizmo controls in it. i personally never beaten the game, but maby i just suck at it. that or i lost patiance with it because i can't get pat the first hole in the floor. do youself a favor and stay away from this pile of bat crap.	-1
This is just too bad. For such a cool character, Batman has had some bad luck with video games. This is probably the worst and that's saying a lot.  This game is no fun (did you see the one star?) and is not worth anyone's time.	-1
when i was a kid, i thought this was fun, but i played it lately, this is so boring and dull	-1
If you think that this is a good game then you seriously need your head examined  I can honestly say I've yet to play a good Spider-Man game. For all the hype, good reviews and people willing to pay the big bucks over this one, I thought it was sure to be the best. How disappointed I was to discover it's one of the blandest and boring beat-em-ups ever.  You begin playing as Spidey (but can later change to Venom if you wish) and you go about tiresome duties beating up generic thugs on the streets of Manhattan. Every thug looks the same and you'll end up punching to death the same guy a billion times (more so for those infuriating end of level bosses). The crap music is the same on every level. Apparently the game has 'additional music' by some band called Green Jelly, who I have never heard of. I assume they must be some none-hit wonder grunge band from Seattle back when all that was new. And quite what exactly they contributed to the game is a mystery as there are only 2 tracks in total (level music and boss music).  There is some plot going on but I couldn't follow it. The comic-book cut -scenes look terrible and the writing is too small to read. Plus the are very slow and add too much time between the boring levels.  The controls and gameplay are dire. There's no fluent movement or grace in the fighting. It's all just an annoying mess and terribly programmed. If you can bear to stay with the game until level 2 you'll know what I mean. It was so rage-inducing I almost gritted my teeth into dust and chucked the controls into the TV.  Stay well away from this horrible game. As a beat-em-up it stinks. As a Spidey game it stinks. It just plain reeks overall.  Graphics C  Sound D  Gameplay D  Lasting Appeal F	-1
Another lousey boring basketball game. where do they come up with these games. this game was stupid.	-1
mischief makers?what does make you think of?teenagers who get bored and break stuff?firecrackers?practical jokes?pranks?how about............none of the above.how about some crap that looks like it belongs on the original atari?no mischief,just a very poorly animated and quite bright super mario bros rip off.save your money a buy a box a paper clips.youll have more fun.	-1
If you're a true Bubsy fan, you would know immediately that the title of my review is actually a quote from the very first thing Bubsy says in his first game.  How prophetic.  Now, let me say that I loathe hyperbole.  Bubsy 3D is not the worst game ever made, and believe me, I have played most of them.  Despite what the fifteen-year-old reviewers on Amazon would have you believe, Bubsy 3D actually won some acclaim when it was released, and retained what was, for the time, the 3D platforming status quo.  The problem with the status quo back then was that there wasn't one, and any given game might have any old control scheme, many of which didn't make any sense.  Bubsy 3D suffered from exactly that, among other things; namely, the overly simplistic environments and the sketchy depth perception.  And oh yeah, it suffered from one more thing: Super Mario 64 had completely blown the lid off of everyone's expectations.  Suddenly, simply average platformers made only months before suddenly looked like clunky, outdated dinosaurs.  And there was left poor old Bubsy.  The controls for the game are clunky at best, that much is certain, and it takes a while to learn his ropes.  His jumping mechanics are very different; the developers solved the depth-perception problem (partially, anyway) by having the camera switch to an overhead view whenever he jumps, giving the player overly precise control over where he lands, a la Jumping Flash.  Unfortunately, he takes so long to get a running start, he will probably slide right off of that platform you just landed on so precisely.  In fact, you will get to know the jumping controls extremely well, because you are going to fall off of that platform quite a bit.  One thing that still surprises me to this day, though, is the sharpness of the game's resolution.  No, there aren't hardly any textures to be found, as Bubsy's 3D world consists of purely colored geometric shapes, but I'll be darned if there isn't hardly a jaggy edge to them.  The characters and their expressions, as well as their animations, are actually really well defined, and the 2D sprites fail to pixelate.  Its just too bad that they all live in a world created by the God of Playskool.  Bubsy 3D is not one of the worst games ever made.  It is simply one of the most unfortunate, a rushed product shoved to the front lines to catch as much residual success off of its competitors as it could.  To understand that, you had to have been there in 1996, when platformers were anybody's game.  When Mario grew up he changed all that, and invited us along for his joyous adventure, from which we never looked back.  Poor Bubsy.	-1
This is exactly what everybody has said already about this game. It's bad... REALLY BAD. The intro movie alone is enough to let you know what you're in for which is a whole lot of crap.  The game only features geometrical shapes and solid colors for graphics. Seriously, it really does look like if you tried to make a 3D world out of construction paper. The controls are waaaaaay off as in if you start running, it's near impossible to turn/stop/maneuver your character and jumping on enemies consists of landing *directly* under your shadow or you will get hit and die. Gliding is a smaller jump that makes you "float" a little.... it's completely USELESS unless you need to use it on those floor-fan-enemies to float up. And the sounds.... ugggghhhh... oh my... atrocious.  But here's the thing about this torture devise... it's entertaining to a certain degree. Now I may be crazy but I bought this just to say "I own one of the worst games in history" but I'm actually compelled to beat it to 100%. A challenge that may result in brain damage but I'm no quitter. If you plan on getting this for the "lolz", get some beer and call a couple of friends over. This is the videogame equivalent of an Asylum movie.	-1
My older brother and I enjoyed the Bubsy series for Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo growing up.  Now that those systems were no longer creating any new titles in favor of the Nintendo 64 and Playstation, it was time to move on to the 64 bit world.  When Bubsy 3D was launched in 1997, we were so excited to try it out, but little do we know that we were being  tricked.  It was a pixelated 3D mess.  My brother got it for his 15th birthday and it was probaly the worst gift he receieved in time.  After trying to figure out this crappy game by enduring the confusing camera rotations, boring music, crappy navigation, and Bubsy's annoying random comments (throughout the game); we just went back to playing the original Bubsy on Sega Genesis.  I may have been the worst friend in the world because I gave Bubsy 3D to my best friend in exchange for Marvel Super Heroes game for Playstation.  This game tarnished the reputation of the lovable, sarcastic Bobcat.  Just stay away from this piece of s*** and go back to your Super NES and Sega titles because they were untouched timeless classics and a whole lot more fun than this 3D garbage.	-1
Well, here it is guys: the WORST Mortal Kombat game of all-time.  Yup, the honor goes to the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat II.  I bought this game when it first came out because I was stupidly riding on the success of the Mortal Kombat series at the time.  I was very naive (all my friends were right!)  Time hasn't been kind to this game, but who am I kidding?  Time wasn't kind to this game the day it came out because it was an absolute piece of plastic trash then, and it's trash now.  It will forever remain trash.  It's so trashy, the trashman won't even take it.  He says it stinks too much, and it's not worth the risk of potentially sniffing the horrible odor *just* to put the game in the back of his truck.  Even if he were to wear the thickest pair of gloves in the world, he doesn't want to risk the smell remaining on his skin permanently.  So why am I bashing the game so hard?  Because you get fewer fighters, fewer levels, HORRIBLE black and white graphics, and the worst part- an extremely slow framerate.  The blood doesn't even exist.  Okay there's blood, but watching it on a hard-to-see black and white screen, would you even call that blood?  No, you wouldn't (and shouldn't).  I would rather have a job being a janitor in an elementary school and having to clean up barf on the cafeteria floors every day, than play the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat II ever again.  It's really that bad.  At least then, you can swirl the puke around with a mop and have some fun.  For the love of God and all his wonderful adorable Earthly creatures- DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  Just when I thought the Mortal Kombat series couldn't get any crappier, it happened.	-1
I heard this game is crap. I have it for NES and its cool. But this is weird. Why would they make a stupid 'easy' game for GBA? Why won't they let you play as the cool people like Baraka? You stubborn retards can make a better choice of system and game then this!!!!!!!	-1
This game is horrid! The graphics and the framerate are too choppy! The sound's okay (sound effect wise), but MKII was never known for it's music. The control is absolutely horrid; there aren't enough buttons on the Game Boy and special moves are nearly impossible to pull off (much less FATALITIES, as there's only one per character).  But the worst of it all happens to be the gameplay. Seriously, I beat this game in half an hour! And when did blood ever become an ink error?    Not worth the price. I suggest that you should dust off your Super NES and buy that version. Avoid Mortal Kombat II on the Game Boy at all costs.  The only thing worse than this is the Game Boy port of Mortal Kombat 3.	-1
In my opinion, the only thing this game has going for it is that it didn't have any competition in the field of RPGs until the Zelda action RPGs.  The developers of this game should be ashamed of themselves for creating this.  I bought the game a couple of years ago and it still sits there and collects dust.  I probably played it for four hours or so and put it away.  I want those four hours back that I wasted.  Nevermind, I would just waste them anyways.	-1
I bought this game way back when the N64 was in its heyday. I thought it wasn't very good and traded it in. Now I see somebody is trying to sell it for $89.95! If anybody is considering buying Quest 64 at this ridiculous price, I urge them to think twice. There are plenty of far, far better games for your money. I know there weren't that many RPGs for the N64 but that doesn't make this game a classic IMHO. You'd be better off looking for some of the excellent SNES RPGs like FF II and III or Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past.	-1
First off my rating is high because I really enjoyed this game. 2ndly it was a N64 RPG, which I don't remember there being many.  You end up using the elements as magic and you mix and match to kind of make your own play style. The battle mechanics were odd, but I always enjoyed games that were challenging so you had to think out what you were going to do, sometimes you would lose a battle due to making a bad move, and you can learn from it and do better.  Unless your someone who likes to play old games, avoid this one, there are games which are all around upgrades. Try Fate or Fable.	-1
Wargods is a much better game made by the same people for the N64. This game is somewhat glitchy and straining. Save your money. Buy a better Mortal Kombat game for a newer system. Not worth having.	-1
Quest 64 is a Role Playing game that stresses 3d eye-candy, with little depth of story, plot, and no long lasting appeal (all three are essential, along with others, for a good rpg). The main character only has one weapon and a few items which most of which repeat themselves in a pattern throughout the entire game. There are no side quests or red herrings to keep you intrigued, no easter eggs. The battle system first of all is the most boring turn based combat system ive ever seen.  Oh and youll spend 80 percent of the game running around the countryside fighting monsters to build your levels (thats all the game's empahsis is on, building levels) and thatll bore you after about a couple of hours, off and on.  The game's story seems to get loss in the building of levels after the first few hours or so. The amazing 3d graphics are the only thing really good about this game, as its the only thing that really keeps it from getting one star.  But still graphics don't make up for a game with such a linear monotonous flow. I recently re-read some of the previous Nintendo Powers reviews of this game hyping it up as being as good as Final Fantasy series....that was a selling/promotional point more than anything else, since as the first editorial writer above said, "Quest 64 sinks in too many areas: (to paraphrase him). If you can find this game used at a exchange store for 5 dollars nowdays then I would buy it, thankfully I only rented it and the guide, rather than pay 50 bucks for this game when it first came out, you should do the same.	-1
blends 3 mortal kombats in one, not the first three games that i expected. game play was lame. Not for beginners very hard.	-1
This version of the trilogy absolutly stunk to high heaven. What the hell happend??? I first brought the MK Trilogy on PC. But after I upgraded to Windows 98 the game would not install anymore, it only worked on Win 95. So I saw the playstaion version, but I never liked the PS and I saw that it was exactly the same as the PC version.. so I figured the N64 version would be just the same.... wrong!!!! There is about 20 charactors missing from the 64 version for some unknown reason. They could well have included them but for some reason this game is more like Mortal Kombat 3 with a few extra charactors.  I hope the PC version gets re-released some day. Or maybe i'll just get a PS version Rom, because MK trilogy is the best MK game ever... just not on the 64.	-1
It didn't not work i had to send it back  I've ordered another one I hope this one works	-1
what a joke, this game is worthless. I wouldn't have taken this game if it had been for free, let alone 4 dollars!	-1
Didn't work	-1
This is not what you'd expect from Rare or from the Donkey Kong series. The game has a really basic plot: The bad croc is going to blow up Donkey  Kong's island. Everyone, including me, was expecting super graphics from  the expansion pack (which you need to play this game). Not true. The  graphics are a bit better then the average game, but not as good as they  could be. The game is remarkably similar to Banjo-Kazoie (another 1 star  game) in that you learn moves as you progress through the game, something I  HATE! The characters also speak in mumbles that get annoying. However,  probably the worst part is that the game play is boring and it is hardly  challenging. I beat the first level fully and almost beat the 2nd through  5th levels in the first week I had it and I haven't touched it since. The  only good part is the multi-player mode. So, if you're going to buy an N64  game, look elsewhere.	-1
Well this game features some of the best graphics Ive ever seen and its easier to learn how to play than Rogue Leader but what were they thinking when they decided not to have a save option?N64 is a superior machine so its not like it doesnt have enough memory to support a save option and even old games like Metroid and The Legend Of Zelda let you save your progress with a password. This game is just like one of those arcade games at movie theatres because its fun to play for a while but pointless to try and beat it because it just doesnt let you save. The new Star Fox game for Game Cube sure as hell better have a save option.	-1
After I saw the movie I was in a real "X-Men" mood so I went out and bought this game. When I started playing it I became very frustrated. It doesn't show you how to do any of the moves in the instruction book (not that I ever need an instruction book to learn moves). To do moves in this game it takes a lot of practice. So to find out how to do anything with a character you have to go into this boring and frustrating training mode. Once you master a character it is then easy to complete the game. But then, if you want to play another character, you have to go back into the training mode all over again. The endings in this game are very short and unsatisfying. The good thing is that after you have beaten the game with everybody you can view each ending linked up together and then it makes a lot more sense and you get more satisfaction. There's lot of things to unlock in this game but no codes. No secret characters. The worse part about this game is the gameplay. I recently went back to play this game after not playing it for about a year. I found out that I had forgotten to do all of the moves. So rather than go back into training mode I just turned it off and put it anyway. I'll probably never play it again.	-1
THE BOSSES THE LEVELS BOTH ARE VERY HARD	-1
I could never get into this game so traded it in for something else.	-1
the graphics is pretty good on this game, but the game play sucks. it's not worth your money.	-1
This game is so stupid, i don't understand why people like it. There is no real fun in it. For one thing you can't jump/ wich is dumb. and the attack moves are really duel. it sucks! do not buy this game.  If by any chance you liked this game then check out all of the other Bomberman games.	-1
I could only get to the first boss. Don't get me wrong I had fun with this game, but many factors killed it for me.   Most noticebly is the controls. The controls in this game are aweful! You have no idea how many cheep deaths the controls caused me. Its the main reason why I could never get pass the first boss. This is an extreme problem when you're facing more than one enemy because the controls won't respond when you need them to. The camera doesn't make things any easier. When platforming the jumping controls and camera will often cause cheep deaths because you can't see where your going or jump at an angle that causes you to fall off.   Another issue I had is that when you get a game over you start all the way to the beginning of the game. Extra lives are also hard to find. This wouldn't be so bad if the controls weren't so bad.   The plus side though is that the music is wonderful and there are moments that are creepy AND SCARY. I would love it if they remade this for the Wii, Xbox, or PS3 with better controls and handling, but due to how long its been I don't see that happening.	-1
Not as advertised. My wife was scammed the same way when she bought me 2 controllers as a gift. THEY ARE NOT NINTENDO CONTROLLERS. It doesn't match up to the yellow & green N64 official controllers I have. They have a grey connector not the blue as in the picture (meaning it's a knock-off). I am not bothered about buying knock-offs but do not assume this is a nintendo controller. Will work fine sometimes and not others. Simply, not good enough.	-1
If I could give no stars I would. Controller shipped quickly but was not as it was described in the listing. Quality was rated as acceptable with a loose joystick. When we opened the box the controller had two cuts (with somewhat exposed wires) in the main cord, dirt in the joystick and memory card areas and other spots that could have easily been cleaned in less then 1 minute. When we plugged the controller in the loose joystick greatly effected game play. We sent the controller back within a few days.	-1
PROs: Encourages exploration Intense final battle against boss Graphics state-of-the-art for its time  CONs: Frustrating angles Tedious and repetitive gameplay Beaver Bother (you know what I'm talking about if you've played this game)  I had always heard how DK64 was such a classic, and so naturally I wanted to finally buy and beat it.  Instead of a classic, I found a game that was, well, kind of lazy. You essentially have 7 levels before the boss level, and you have to beat each of these levels with 5 different characters. So, you have to spend your time getting all of DK's bananas and missing the other 4 characters' bananas, because only Diddy can get Diddy bananas, only Tiny can get Tiny coins, etc. This means you have to basically go back and re-do the whole level with another character all over again.  Couple this with the fact that camera angles are constantly changing on you, it makes for a very ho-hum experience.  At one point during the 30 hours it took me to beat this game, I turned on the game and found all my data was erased. At first I was angry, but then kind of relieved that I didn't have to feel like I needed to finish this game anymore. That's saying a lot, because I always finish games I start. (I turned the game on-and-off again, and the data was there again, so I did finish playing it. But the point still stands: I WANTED my data to be erased.)	-1
When I think of the N64, I think about great games and memories. Games like Golden-Eye 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, and Banjo- Kazooie. Memories like getting my fore-head shot by my brother, grabbing my 120th power star, and meeting Princess Zelda for the first time.  Donkey Kong 64 doesn't come up in any of these if you haven't noticed by now, and for good reason. It's slow, pokey, and not really all that fun. Which is really a problem after the success of the Donkey Kong Country trilogy.  THE GRAPHICS: Donkey Kong 64 seems to take the graphics roll from Super Mario 64, in that the characters are a little on the blocky side, but their really not all bad. I've only come across a few complaints which is demonstrated in the following description: In one area, the room has a large wooden treasure chest with a switch of the character's face on it. Sounds fine right? Wrong, the switch attached to the chest is made from a vent in one of the previous areas. A metal switch attached to a wooden chest. Sheer laziness. VERDICT:*** 3/5  THE STORY: Quite simple really, Donkey's horde of bananas have been stolen once again by King K. Rool, ruler of the Kremling reptiles. He's also done the liberty of imprisoning all of the other Kongs in cells mapped around the game. The game introduces many new character like Lanky Kong and the banana fairies, along with some pretty whacked up levels. It's not really all that original, but it works. THE VERDICT: *** 3/5  THE GAME-PLAY: This is where Donkey Kong 64 kills, and not in the good way. The game rips from the popular "grab the golden item to proceed to more levels" style originated by Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. Now, that would be fine since the genre has pretty much held water for years, but DK64 has you "power-walking" your way through each task, some of which are dragged on already.   It takes me about 7 minutes just trying to go to the level I choose (except the first level). The game is loaded with long hallways, ledges you need to slowly climb, and slow frame-rate issues at times. If Rare had upped the speed to about 2.33 times faster, I probably wouldn't have constantly been yelled at to leave my younger brother's room so he could sleep. Oh yeah, and I got a serious sore thumb from holding the joystick in the same direction. This game ruins hands, and sleepy little brothers. THE VERDICT: * 1/5  THE MUSIC: The game ranges from toy factories, jungles, pyramids and the like, so you can imagine a wide arrange of tunes to come across. Some of the music is pretty catchy, but I didn't find myself dazzled by any means. I found myself humming 2 or 3 songs, but that was it, none of which you'll be hearing very often. The sound-effects are fitting and pretty original. Thanks to this game every time I see an orange, I immediately think of the sound the orange grenades make in this game. Pretty funny right? VERDICT: *** 3/5  OVERALL: DK64 had a lot of hype, and it's a shame it didn't turn out since it was made by the same guys behind the Donkey Kong County, Battletoads, and Jet Force Gemini series, which were excellent gems. I played this game as a kid years ago and completed everything in the game, I really must have exaggerated greatly how fun it was back then, because I can't seem to have any courage to attempt getting everything in just level 4. While the music is descent, the graphics okay and the story shallowly good, none of those elements are what make you play a game. You play to have fun, to enjoy the universe of the characters, and to enhance you skills. I'd be able to accomplish all those things twice as much just eating a banana and watching my dad trim his nails than playing Donkey Kong 64.   OOOOH BANANA.  OVERALL VERDICT: ** 2/5	-1
What a weird game.  I got this expecting the same type of thing that was going on in those great super nintendo games.  But hey, if you like confusing and weird puzzles than you might enjoy this game.  I suggest that you get it anyway but only to see how different it is than the dk country games.  This is a puzzle level game, not a dk country game.  I got bored and annoyed with it and stopped playing after having it for a few weeks.  These are my updated comments.  Recently, I challenged my review above and my view of this game.  I decided to learn how to get good at it, thus, leading to enjoyment of the game.  I actually got hooked, playing it for over 80 hours so far.  Point being, this game is not awful, it is, however, tricky.  If you enjoy Glover or even if you somehow found a way to enjoy Mario 64, you will like this game.  I would say that my new rating of fun would be 4 of 5 and my new overall would be 3 of 5.  The overall is still low because of how frustrating this game is.	-1
I borrowed this game from a friend. I played for half an hour then got bored. I'm glad I didn't pay money for it. It's pretty much just Banjo-Kazooie(which I also didn't like). I was upset, especially when I got to the first door requiring gold bananas. Why couldn't they have just put out another Banjo-Kazooie game and make an ORIGINAL Donkey Kong game for the N64.  Banjo-Kazooie was fun, until the difficulty spiked out of nowhere. Also, the idea of making a cartoonish adventure somewhat nonlinear is poorly executed in it.  I didn't play far enough to see if Donkey Kong corrected any of this, but it looks like it didn't. It just changed the setting from running around inside of a mountain to running around inside of islands. Great.  If you liked Banjo-Kazooie, I'm sure you'll love this. If not, definitely skip Donkey Kong.	-1
donkey kong is a stupid game the charaters are monkeys for the love of God monkeys.this game does not have a story line do not try this game.	-1
As a fan of the X-Com games and Shadow Watch, I was really looking forward to this game.  Based on the Editorial Reviews on this site, I was expecting somethiing in a similar vein. Unfortunately, there are some subtle  problems with this game that make it vastly inferior to the previously  mentioned titles, and cause the game play to be rather slow and  frustrating. Problems with the tactical level: #1.  Extremely long  fights:  Most of the weapons in this game are frustratingly innacurate and  don't do much damage.  As a result, fights go on and on and on and on and  on and . . well, you get the idea.  In X-Com and Shadow Watch, fire fights  tend to be relatively quick and decisive.  If a bad guy steps out in front  of you without cover, he goes down.  In this game though, he can stand  right in front of you at a range of three or four spaces and it will still  take a few turns to kill him.  You shoot and miss, and shoot and miss and  so on.  And then when you finally do hit the guy, it takes five or six  shots to take him down. Your mouse hand will get sore from all the point  and clicking. Both the accuracy and the lethality of all the weapons in the  game should be about doubled or trippled, which would lead to shorter, more  decisive engagements. 2.  Computer controlled characters have a huge  advantage in accuracy:  This is a weird glitch that becomes really obvious  from about the second fight onwards.  All computer controlled units are  roughly two to three times as accurate as your (supposedly elite) mercenary  units.  What does this mean? A couple of examples: a.)  One of your  mercenaries (with a high accuracy rating) is lying on the ground, firing at  an opponent lying on the ground, with no intervening cover.  The computer  controlled character will hit you about four times for every time you hit  him. b. You have a unit which has carfully positioned itself crouching  behind a tree for cover, shooting at a computer unit standing in the open.  You will hit each other with about the same frequency. While over all  game balance is preserved by the fact that your mercs can just take so damn  much damage, it still makes game play awefully frustrating.  Here you are,  knocking yourself out to find good covered positions to protect your guys,  and the computer still hits them easily, while you're missing its guys that  are out in the open. The problem becomes even more annoying once you start  training local militia to protect your villages.  Being computer  controlled, the local militia also benefit from this huge increase in  accuracy, which means that they completely outclass the mercenaries who  trained them.  Which makes you wonder why they needed your mercenaries to  come liberate them in the first place. Problems with the Strategic  Level: Unbalance Economy:  Simply put, the amount of money running around  in the game doesn't balance out against the cost of most items.  Local  Militia, for example, can be trained for $750, a sum so small by comparison  to what your mines are turning out that it doesn't even enter into your  strategic thinking.  Similarly, the rewards for completing quests in the  game are ludicrously small wnen compared to your income.  What do you say  to a major NPC who is trying to get you to do some major quest by offering  you 20K dollars.  "Hello, I make more than that in a single day of  mining.  Why should I bother?".  The numbers on a lot of this stuff  need to be adjusted. 2.  A preponderence of innefectual hand guns:  For  some reason, most of the mercs that you can afford at the start of the game  come equipped with hand guns rahter than assault rifles.  Excuse me?  A  professional merc who's going to airdrop into the middle of a civil war  with only a pistol?  This is particularly ludicrous when you realize how  innefectual handguns are in this game.  Even at close range, an NPC is  likely to die of old age long before you ever manage to finish him off with  a .38 revolver. Adding to this problem is the fact that you can't buy  rifles.  Oh sure, the nice mail order company that you do business with  will send you ammo, but not big guns, grenades, night vision goggles, or  any of the really cool stuff that you want to play with.  To get that  stuff, you have to ever so slowly find it off the bodies of dead enemies.  In the course of 15 hours of play, I managed to find only two rifles.  Unfortunately, they were of a calliber that I couldn't buy ammo for.  Arrg.  Why can't you just buy decent armaments in this game? Overall, I would  have to encourage people to buy all the X-Com games and Shadow Watch before  buying this one.  And even then, I would replay the former titles again  before sending buying this one.  Firefights in Jagged Alliance are  needlessly long and indecisive, there is little variation between combat  locations and opponents, and there is a lot of built in frustration in the  fact that your units are so vastly inferior to those controlled by the  computer.  This is a game with a lot of subtle problems that should have  been caught in the beta testing.	-1
I wish they would make a Gamecube side-scrolling Donkey Kong effort like the SNES games, just make the graphics better, retain the music quality and make more levels and longer. They included some lovely old games like the original DONKEY KONG arcade game, and a spaceman game for computer. There are big worlds, but that seems just about it. There's a lot of collecting, but the problem-solving is no fun. This series became really removed from it's huge SNES appeal.	-1
I bought DK64 when it first came out in 1999, and from the moment I started to play it I did not like it at all. It is way too complicated and difficult to play, and I would not recommend this game. Every time I tried to play it I just kept getting frustrated, and I had to stop playing it. Instead I would recommend Banjo-Kazooie or Mario 64.	-1
...the actual game is okay but certainkly isn't on par with goldeneye. with the exception of the man dan carrington the characters are wooden and the story is very poor, you never feel into the game's story at all. the level design in general is bad, like the supposed 'stealth' mission in chicago where every enemy knows where you are anyway so there is no stealth involved whatsoever. some of the levels though are fun with inspired design like the sniping levcel in the snow but it doesnt make the game good. what does make the game worth playing is the multi player modes, although the graphics take another turn for the worse they are acceptable in 2 player but with 4 you cant see anything at all without a massive tv. the multi modes make pd, beating the hell out of simulants in slow motion can be fun and sure beats the game. this is what you should be buying the game for, not for the story mode. the trouble with this is that the pd arenas are poor and its only the graphically altered goldeneye levels that are worth playing. a bit lazy on the developers part. overall: except for the inclusion of mr. carrington the story mode is a bust so unless you have enough mates to make the multi worthwhile don't buy it.	-1
Nintendo has taken one of the greatest racing games for SNES and revamped it into a whole different futuristic racing game. For starters, there are 30 racers rather than 4, and this game is very fast! But to be so fast and have 30 racers, the game is very cheaply detailed. Lets just say the car your driving is very small and looks like a box with rocket boosters. Also with 30 cars 6 cars to start and 24 to earn, it gets a bit confusing as to who you should chose to race as, so there are detailed photos of each driver so that people can pick their favorite to drive as. The originality of the game is the fact that the track forms itself into any sort of shape. It goes into huge anti-gravity loops, half pipes where you can drive on the ceiling, and pipes where you can race on the outside of it... all around it... without falling off! There are three levels of difficulty, customizable colors, cars, speeds, acceleration and three circuits with seven or so unique tracks. Finally there is an original battle mode, where you must destroy other racers by knocking them off the track. This is a game you should rent before you buy.	-1
Simply confusing and I don't see how any non-6 year old kid in the 90s could like this.	-1
If you think a super hero game can never be too fast-pased, this could change your mind. Enemies come at you from every corner throughout the entire game, constantly trying to take you under. You'd swear you were in Detroit. If you want a slower-paced game based on the animated series, try the SNES version. It doesn't let you play as Robin, but it has more depth and . . . wait a minute!! I'm not reviewing the SNES version!!! As either Batman or Robin, you throw various weapons at your enemies as you keep scrolling to the right and trying not to get killed.	-1
I remember burrowing this from a friend because I ran out of N64 games to play so I burrowed this and some other games for a few days. I have to say it was fun at first, than it became frustrating, and than I felt like I was going to throw up because of the weird controls and this and that moving around in weird places which I didn't intended in doing. It was also because I was really young then and I really didn't know what the game was really about, which is puzzle solving sometimes.  I advise not buying the game, instead tell your friend to buy it because its the best game ever and take it from him when he wants to throw it out. Of course you'll lose a friend, but well worth it! Game > Friendship. I'm just playing kids.	-1
To say the least, Donkey Kong took everything this genre stood for, and made a muck-up of it. Endless item collecting, muddy details and slow action leave this one for the chimps, uh, chumps. You have bananas, golden and coloured, coins, coconuts, ammo, musical notes etc. and for five characters. The collecting seems endless, and when i was forty % done the game, i just stopped. I looked at this forest level and i said, this looks just like the desert and water ones, only with a different backdrop. And what's with the story? Some giant floating island or something? Why does K Rool have such a loathing for the Kongs? WHy doesn't he just butcher them instead of placing them in unguarded, easily escapable places???? Rare really messed up on this one. The sound isn't all that awesome (the DK rap, what the heck was that?), and the graphics were bleh; this thing required the 4mb expansion? Banjo Kazooie looked twice as good. Even the characters are lame. I thought the release of Kiddy Kong in DKC3 was dumb, but now we have three new characters that couldve easily been replaced by 2 old ones. Tiny is the spitting image of Dixie, and Lanky is the babyish side of Kiddy while Chunky is, well the chunky side. I think Rare thought their game was weak themselves, that must be why they added this mediocre 3rd person shooter multiplayer, isn't it? They didn't think they did a good job on the shooter part did they? I have so many peeves about this game, it's nuts. What difference is tehre between the gun and the instrument??? They both unlock things. Why did Rare feel it necessary to have two things that can work switches?? Honestly, the only entertaining and redeeming part of this game are the Jetpac and Donkey Kong hidden arcade games. Certainly a long game, but length is not always a good thing. Look at Conker's BFD, it was short, and still owned this game wicked bad. 15 hours of this, and you'll wish Rare had stopped there.	-1
I was extremely disappointed with this title.  You will like it if you like Goldeneye, but definitely go with Goldeneye over this game.  The multiplayer is 50 times better than Goldeneye, but the cheats and single player levels leave EVERYTHING to be desired.  For one thing, it requires more sneaking around because one missed shot hits the wall letting the guards know of your presence who will then hit you with perfect accuracy and kill you in a matter of seconds because of your quickly draining life meter.  You also run out of bullets faster and reload much slower.  The difficulty is just about near impossible.  If you can't beat Goldeneye with EVERYTHING as in cheats, bonus levels, record times, etc, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  You can't beat this game on Perfect Agent unless you're a game tester, and I'm sure even they had problems.  The game is so hard it just totally degrades from the fun factor.  The plot is also absurd.  Aliens and such.  Ha Ha.  Amusing.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  I strongly reccomend going for Goldeneye rather than Perfect Dark.	-1

Here comes the (one-time) end of an era.  And sadly, it ends not with a bang, but with a whimper.  Like MM7 before it, Mega Man 8 suffered quite a bit of backlash, and this time around it was a result of the rather unbecoming 16-bit-ish graphical structures on the 32-bit wonders of the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation, and, if you ask me, it was not the title to follow the monstrous Mega Man X4 that came out around the same time.  Still, for all the weeping against statues, MM8 still serves up some classic Mega Man fun with that new-school Mega Man X feel.  The searching for hidden items becomes more important and challenging this time around, the action is still consistently hectic, and the level designs are pretty nicely done with some rich and vivid color work.  However, there's a very cheesy, sugar-coated appeal to this, even more so than MM7 (which, I think, was trying to emulate the American animated series); that and the bosses and weapons don't seem as good as they could have been, Rush's abilities aren't as important as they used to be, and the voice acting is atrocious for certain characters (Dr. Light, Bass, and some of the bosses are the prime sinners in this regard...and Rush Shiraishi did a better job voicing X in X4 than she did Mega Man in this.  It fits better, if you ask me).  Still, there's enjoyment to be had.  Just remember to take it at face value...and consider it a stepping stone to Mega Man 9.	-1
This could be considered the companion to Alien Trilogy as it takes place in the Fourth Movie following the first three presented in Alien Trilogy.  This game featured controls that people are more familiar with in these days, but didn't understand at the time.  The controls may be above average, and the graphics are excellent for the time, but seriously, the level design is a piece of crap!  What kind of space ship is this?  Very illogical design leads to BORING gameplay that is only fun for 5 minutes with invincibility turned on, otherwise you'll die in 2 minutes without it because you move soo slow.  An interesting thing is that if you get impregnated by a facehugger you won't be allowed to go through airlocks or elevators, which is interesting that they followed through on this principal with the chestbursters, and you'll have to find a device to take out the creature before the time runs out.  The thing that doesn't make sense with this is that even with a chestburster inside you, aliens will attack you, and that makes no sense.  Facehuggers can also attack you by hitting you with their tails.  Don't play this game, I'd rather watch the movie.	-1
Alien Ressurection the game, makes the movie of the same title look like an Oscar winning masterpiece (well, ok maybe not).  The only reason it got two stars was for the awesome atmosphere and graphics that this game has to offer plus the level of geniune fear and suspense that it conjurs up. Now for the bad...nothing ever really happens in this game.  At times, it is downright BORING.  You wander around in the pitch black half the time waiting for something really bad to happen...but it never does.  When I say this game is dark, I mean dark as in no light.  You can't see half the time and the worthless flashlight that you have runs out of batteries every five minutes.  The controls are sloppy and unnecessarily difficult.  The weapons/ammo are limited and you really have to search for them in some of the later levels which makes the game seem contrived, like they added that feature only to make the game longer.  Alien Trilogy was a much better game.  Like the Alien movies, too many sequels makes for a predictable and downright boring ride.	-1

There are evil forces in America that will try to sell you anything, and these evil forces understand the public's fascination with sports heroes and celebrities, and so take a sports hero and a video game and shouldn't that be a winning combination? Listen: this game is simply retarded. A basketball player does not a martial artist make. At first glance you might think this game is pretty cool; after all, the graphics are very well done and the animation is very fluid. But when you realize that you have a total of three moves--punch, kick, jump--and that you can defeat any evil kung fu master just by endlessly jump kicking across the screen and bouncing like a pogo stick, you realize this is not going to be a very deep fighting game. But, yeah, the graphics are pretty good so this game doesn't suck as bad as it possibly could. And then you remember that it's about a basketball hero who just happens to be a world-class martial artist, and that that martial artist is none other than Shaquille O'Neil. And you realize that you have too much free time on your hands, and that maybe you're playing this cart because you're really desperate to be entertained, and then you realize you were having more fun with Bimini Run, which you go back to. OK, to be fair, this game isn't nearly as bad as Bimini Run but it's still pretty ridiculous. Recommended only for those who enjoy a nice steaming pile of crap.	-1

When Yoshi's Story came out, I was stoked thinking it was a 64-bit sequel to Yoshi's Island. I was SO WRONG. This game is aimed at 5-10 year old gamers. You go around "Chapters" collecting fruit in the levels to advance, thus levels have no actual exit. There's 4 areas in each chapter. 6 chapters calls for 24 total levels in the game. To make this game even more disappointing, when you finish one level (say 1-1), you'd think you go to 1-2, but no. Instead you go to Chapter 2. What the heck?! It turns out you have to find red hearts hidden in each level to unlock a level in the next chapter. To unlock all of Chapter 1's level you have to complete one level, die, then go back. It's a stupid setup. I was really hoping for a Yoshi's Island 2 type game here but this is Nintendo cashing in on their child fanbase. Basically, if you're older than 10, this game will be too childish for your liking.	-1
This is a superb shooting game with lots of realism and strategy incoprorated. Graphics are great as is choice of team-mates and weaponary. I guess that it pretty realstic in a lot of ways as your team mates get in your way, and the terrorists are not as stupid as they are on some other games - they will shoot at you as soon as they see you. But there are times when you shoot at a terrorist and he doesn't die but shoots you instead. It seems to be a problem with the game. There are lots or really weird glitches too. You see dead terrorists levitating and half of them stuck through walls and their legs hanging down through the roof etc. I find it irritating that the designers take so much care to make tyres go down when you shoot them, and different sounds when you shoot a bed or a window, but then so little detail is given to other aspects such as the lights which don't go out if you shoot them. I have never seen lights like that. "Goldeneye" has lights that pop so why doesn't this? A lot of this game is just too difficult to win at. In addition, you get a mission such as the one at the datcha where you must avoid detection -  this is really difficult. The idea is to plant a bug and a camera and leave as though you've never even been there. You can go round and shoot al the windows out and still complete the level...and no one will notice that there are windows missing, glass everywhere and bullet holes in the walls? My point is, if you are going to go for realism then go all the way, or not at all. My low rating for this game is due to the problems I have had playing it on the PC. I think it's a game with really great potential, but you end up waiting all the time while the computer makes grinding sounds which freeze your action, but while you are frozen it really impedes playability and you end up getting shot because you can't react. Unplayable due to this, and I have a powerful computer, so that's not the problem. This is overambitious for the PC market, and there are things that need rethinking to make it a better game.	-1
This game is insainly hard The first stage has snow monsters and a dark lil room 2nd or 3rd stage is a train. Where you must hop from cart to cart and reach the end Then you got a boss who is very fast & strong Sewer levels Canyon levels Racing level Big & multible bosses wow x.x	-1
I remember renting for the weekend at our local video store ages ago. It took about an hour to figure out how to make the grappler hit the sweet spot so I could get to the second floor. That was only the first level! In case you're wondering, I had no problem getting past the first stage in other video games. So it wasn't my lack of experience, it was the abysmal game design. The music, or at least the music I heard (as I stopped playing after the first level) was mediocre. If you really want to play a Batman Game for SNES, I recommend "Batman Returns" and "The Adventures of Batman and Robin". Some "bad" games can still be fun but this one isn't.	-1
I remember playing this game a few times with my friend. And then I asked him why did he get it....over and over. Batman Forever is based on the so so movie of the same name and as licensed games go, developers rush it out the door as soon as possible to make money. So that's one of the many reasons why this game wasn't so great.  As some of the other reviewers have stated, this game used digitized graphics and controls made popular by Mortal Kombat at the time. So, it looks great for a SNES game and uses the Batman license. Unfortunately, everything else about the game sucked. Batman and Robin both move around like either tanks or robots. Basic things like walking and jumping are a chore to do. They each have special moves, which are set up like moves you perform in fighting games, except they rarely work. The enemies were super hard to beat and it seems every couple of minutes you see a loading screen (you should NEVER wait for a game to load if it's on a cartridge!) Add in the lack of save features or continues and you got a hard game that wasn't meant to be played or beaten.  Stay away from this crap even if you are tempted to buy it. It isn't worth it and it turned out to be WORSE than the bad movie it was based on.	-1
The digitized actors give the game an interesting visual style, and the levels/backgrounds bear a decent resemblance to certain sections of the movie. As someone who's played a lot of Mortal Kombat I thought the controls were decent, but I can understand how frustrating gadget usage must be if you aren't used to inputting 'special move' commands all the time.  Really, the game just gets boring and repetitive after awhile. There's not a lot to do except beat up thugs, and the 'loading' that takes place between each room kills the momentum and gameplay flow. A lack of continues or save feature keeps you from wanting to jump back in when you die. And beyond the graphics in the levels, presentation is downright bad with bland elevator music and a weird batcomputer display that tries to move the narrative along. Plus what kind of game do you have when the manual doesn't even list how to jump down between floors in a room??  2-player co-op does make the game a bit better, until you either get stuck or get bored. Overall, another dud Batman licensed game.	-1
As the other reviews have stated, this is a very boring game. You are Batman or Robin set out to save Gotham from the Riddler and Twoface. An interesting thing to this game is that the buttons are set up like Mortal Kombat, high punch, low punch, up to jump and select to use your grappling hook. When you start each level you make a choice of two extra weapons like smoke bombs, gas guns and baterangs. There's not much to the game, you move straight through on a set side scrolling platform path beating up bad guys. The graphics are pretty amazing, being that the game is so much like Mortal Kombat, so are the graphics!	-1
Batman Forever is a perplexing experience all on its own.  The original film, released in 1995 is one of the more divisive films in the entire franchise (it's neither universally loved nor universally hated).  Being a bit more kid friendly, light hearted and trying to be fun.  It's surprising then, that the video game doesn't even try to be fun or entertaining.  Batman Forever is a boring and monotonous game that came out in a time when creating video games based off movies were not always good... but they weren't exactly bad.  As a film Batman Forever is probably an okay outing.  As a video game it's a great cure for insomnia and a good lesson on how not to create a game.  I should note that Batman Forever was available on several different platforms.  The Super Nintendo version might've been slightly better than the Sega Genesis one, but merely because of the controls not necessarily because one console was better than the other.  Let's start with the basics though.  The game is based off the movie and divided into eight levels.  Before each level you get to choose two gadgets to take into each stage.  Batman has a good arsenal of tools.  You have the Bat Bola which can render enemies temporarily immobile, smoke grenades or even a device that makes you invincible so long as you're using it correctly.  Players don't just have to play as Batman either.  One can also play as Robin.  While Batman uses exclusively his fisticuffs, Robin actually has a staff he can use as well.  The two also sometimes get different gadgets they can choose from.  While Batman as pellets and grenades, for instance, Robin has a blinding light, tranquilizer darts and wrist rivets to stop enemies in their tracks.  There are also default gadgets the two have on them all the time such as the Batarang.  It may seem like Batman and Robin would play radically different, but they actually don't.  Each one of them has a set of universal tools.  Not just the batarang, but also a grappling hook to reach other layers of stages, tiny bombs to find hidden passages in the floors (and to deal damage to enemies etc.) and the same basic attacks.  Despite Robin having a staff it doesn't operate any different than Batman's fist.  The game won't be significantly easier if you use one character over another.  You might think their gadgets where they differ make a huge difference but the gadgets the game is made to favor are shared by both of them.  It might seem great to try to decide whether you should use Batman's slippery goo or Robin's Sticky goo but both tools are so horrible you'd never actually use them to begin with.  Both have the preferred Bat Bola and respective gadgets that will make them invincible when the gadget is active.  You won't find any significant difference in the characters.  Each level has lots of things to find.  There are items to pick up, enemies to vanquish and secret passages to find.  Some levels also have hidden blue prints and if you find them all you'll unlock hidden gadgets the two can use.  As with many of the gadgets, though, they're not really anything special.  The game has you traverse each of these stages, room-by-room, beating up the enemies, uncovering secrets and finding a goal.  The goal of each level isn't always specified.  While there is a small briefing before hand, most levels end once you finally get to the end and have dispatched all enemies.  Some stages have actual bosses to defeat such as Two-Face or The Riddler, but they're usually just glorified henchmen.  Most rooms just have you fight through thugs, each with a life gauge of their own.  Once it's depleted they're dead.  It's a typical beat-em up but without the usual elements that create a good beat' em up.  This isn't like Final Fight or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time.  The levels aren't short and snappy, there is nothing pressing you forward and you're on a single plain in a side scroller.  At first this is perfectly fine, but then the game begins to get really boring really fast.  Once you've played the first ten minutes or so of Batman Forever, you pretty much know everything you need to know about the game.  You walk into a room, beat up some bad guys and walk to the next room.  There aren't a lot of variations to it or specific goals you need find.  It's just you as Batman or Robin walking through a room and beating up people.  There are occasionally platforming moments, but they're frustrating thanks to the strange jumping mechanic that's made for combat and not platforming.  All of this brings together a game that's surprisingly boring to play.  The levels are lengthy but they aren't engaging.  Were it actually a traditional side scrolling beat 'em up it might've actually been okay, but instead it's a game where you go room by room.  But doing this isn't even all that great in and of itself as each time you enter a room you have to wait for the game to load each area.  For large stages with several rooms such as the first level of the game where enemies can knock you back into a previous room... this is going to get annoying.  The game even flashes the words "Hold on," each time you go to another area.  The music also isn't adding anything to this either.  It's kind of boring and repetitive... but it also doesn't really pump you up or make you feel like Batman.  Take, for example, how the SNES version of "The Adventures of Batman and Robin."  Everything about that game reminds you of the animated television show it's based on.  Here you've got nothing that reminds you you're playing a Batman game.  The game also doesn't play well.  There are far too many things to do and not enough buttons, even on the Super Nintendo, to compensate.  Your grappling hook, for instance is mapped to the "Select" button and if you want to shoot it straight up you need to press "Select+Up."  The end result is that if you don't press them both exactly at the right time you end up just shooting your grappling hook to swing normally (a moment that is only actually needed ONCE in the entire game).  This sounds pretty bad as it is, but it's a nightmare when using gadgets.  The game itself makes you use gadgets the way you use moves in Street Fighter II.  This works for Street Fighter because it's a fighting game.  Here's it's awful.  When beset upon by several enemies at once it can be annoying to enter the specific commands for your gadget.  It also doesn't help that sometimes the controls aren't responsive to the inputs.  It doesn't matter anyway, you don't need you gadgets to take down enemies anyway.  The only time it's useful to have even one (the Bat-Bola) is when taking on Two-Face who is surprisingly the only enemy that's difficult to defeat otherwise.  Aside from that, the game isn't challenging at all, it's just repetitive.  From stage 2 and further along you'll mostly run into the same enemies over and over all capable of doing very similar things.  Sure you'll come across a Riddler Thug eventually or you'll fight clowns in the circus stage but none of these enemies have much of anything that separates them from the enemies you're already facing.  There's nothing unique, nothing that's visually striking.  Two Face is likely the only enemy that seems to actually be different from the onsalught of other thugs you'll face.  Even the Riddler (who is the game's final boss, by the way) fights almost exactly like the basic enemies you'll face getting to him.  Are there good points to Batman Forever?  Sure, but even they come with an asterisk.  For instance, the game has some decent animations and is actually quite visually appealing.  But the levels themselves are repetitive, utilizing the same backgrounds and designs constantly.  The game looks good I just wish there were more of it to look at.  The level design also isn't enough to actually distract you from the same constant backgrounds appearing constantly.  It also takes just a little too long to explore every nook and cranny of the game.  Each level grades you on whether you could find all the secrets in a stage or defeated all the enemies and the like.  Completing these tasks rewards you with extra lives but the game is so simple you won't need them... and these tasks needlessly pad out the game to a length it simply doesn't need to be.  There are no greater rewards for doing so.  All it does is prolong what will already feel like a long experience.  The game also doesn't have a bad soundtrack either.  It's surprisingly good.  The opening title theme and the music that plays in the stages is actually good.  It just sounds slightly (not always but slightly) out of place for a Batman game.  But for the most part it's good.  I even found myself humming some tunes.  Batman Forever is a game that's close to being good.  But the repetitive nature of its combat and the fact that you've seen and experienced everything there is experience with the first level alone makes it less fun to play than other games.  It's a pretty boring game that, for those who have time, can use it to kill two hours, but it's going to feel like it's far longer than two hours to complete.  Visuals and music aside, there's nothing that special about Batman Forever that's going to keep you coming back to it time and time again.	-1
Diddy Kong Racing, simply put, is a game I have tried to love, and simply cannot do it.  I have even tried to play it, but I cannot simply stand playing this insipid game.  I do now know why, but this simply is not a good game.  Perhaps it is particular tastes.  But I simply cannot stand this game.  The tracts are fairly imaginative.  One grating thing about it is say you hit a tree.  Well, instead of bouncing off like on many other racing games, you stay bashing into the tree.  It does have some interesting features, however.  The sheer volume of tracts (had it been any other game would have been a plus) shows ingenuity, the story line is interesting, but in execution the game just flails horribly. Why do I give it 2 stars?  The concept.  I love the concept.  Making an adventure out of a racing game, and the format they gave it is an excellent idea.  The sheer number of tracks is exhilarating.  And on some courses there are THREE (plane, hovercraft, kart) types of vehicles to use.  It is just a tragedy that in practice it doesn't come off at all.  It is nowhere near Super Mario Kart 64.  That game is fast-paced and loads of fun, the best racer to hit the N64.  Size wise, this dwarves Mario Kart 64.  If they could have had the execution on Mario Kart 64 and the concept of Diddy Kong Racing, we would have had one hell of a game.  Sadly, such a game does not exist (yet).  We have to settle with a badly executed game (Diddy Kong Racing) with another racing game that is superb in all manner of ways.  But, with a little engineering, we could have the best of both worlds.  Super Mario Kart 64 is the way to go, folks.  The multiplayer battle is really fun too, especially Block Fort.  Superiour in concept, inferiour in execution.  That's the bottom line.	-1
So after the success of Batman Returns, there would be a movie adaption of Batman Forever.  The graphics looked interesting.  Almost a next gen feel for the SNES.  And it would be a brawler.  So how could it go wrong?  Well first off, it feels like they are trying to rip off Mortal Kombat. But the worst sin is that the controls are horrendous.  They are so frustrating.  I remember spending most of my time mashing buttons just trying to get my grappling hook to work.  Still brings up bad memories all these years later! The story is fine.  And it is a good challenge in game play.  But its never a good game where the main challenge is the broken controls.  Game better left lost to the sands of time.	-1
I reviewed this game a while back on the Genesis, and yeah its not one of the better Batman games that's 4 sure! With a few minor differences in sound and landscape design of the levels this game is almost identical to the Genesis version, and that being said your in for a lot of headaches.  The set up of this game is very unique. The gameplay mechanics resemble something from Mortal Kombat or other fighting games, but its actually a walkthrough/beat-em up style action game though. You can choose as Batman or Robin, and of course with the option of having a 2 player mode as well. Like the Genesis version they use real live digitized footage of actors for the sprites in the game so it looks pretty good overall. That is also where a lot of the pros end on this game, the rest are cons!  First off its extremely hard not just because of the constant barrage of enemies you face but the controls I think may have been designed by a programmer with a really bad sense of humor! The characters do not respond and sometimes feel glitchy and too perform the easiest of moves it takes a very odd button combination. So fighting the constant flow of enemies is super annoying and frustrating! And also the SNES is known for having great soundtracks and sound quality in its games, not here, there are literally 2 tracks through out the game! 0_o  The Adventures of Batman and Robin on The Sega Genesis is a great Batman game, and its port on the SNES isn't too shabby either, check out one of them but avoid this one!	-1
When it first came out, the graphics for this game were state-of-the-art. Now they are not good. The gameplay is very forgetable as well, it plays like a futuristic Tomb Raider with lousy puzzles. The only possible reason to buy this game is that the voice of Blasto is done by the great Phil Hartman.	-1
Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire was released near the end of 1996 and was one of the first generation games for the N64. It's a decent Star Wars game overall with nagging issues that keep it from being one of the better games for the system.  Set after the events in the movie Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back but before the events in the movie Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi (and also based on the book of the same name), you set out to help Luke Skywalker and rescue Princess Leia from the hands of Prince Xizor. Choose from 3 difficulty levels and battle through 9 levels set in planets that are part of the Star Wars universe; battling enemies and making your way around as you would in a platform game.  The PROS: Well, the overall presentation is good enough to make you feel you're in the Star Wars universe as the sound effects and music are what you expect to hear in Star Wars games. Even though the game has 9 levels, they are long levels so you won't be cruising through so easily.  The CONS: Unfortunately, this is not one of the better SW games available for the N64 for several reasons. This game was part of the first generation of games for the N64 and it shows. The graphics did not age so well and back in 1996 , they were horrible. Super Mario 64 was a launch title and it had way better graphics. Here, the game gets choppy when there's a lot of action, the frame rate dips every so often and there is lots of "pop up" scenery and dense fog (to cover up areas that don't have any animation.) The controls are no better than the ones in the PS title "Tomb Raider". Your character controls like a robot, aiming is a chore to do and the game has horrible collision detection. Add in the platform elements where you have to jump in certain areas and either you end up dying or trying to jump again because the jump button doesn't respond until a full second AFTER you press it. On top of all that, the game's difficulty is pretty unforgiving. Even if you set in on "easy", the enemies are still pretty tough and sometimes you have no idea if your weapons have an effect on whoever you are shooting at.  Considering that the first level is easily the best of the game altogether, you're pretty much hyped and can't wait to see the rest of the game. Unfortunately, when you do, you realize that the game falls flat on its face. Star Wars: SotE had a lot of potential. It's a Star Wars game and gives you the feeling that you're part of the awesome story it conveys. But that feeling goes away fast as the crappy graphics, robot like controls, bad platform elements and near impossible difficulty that this game presents keeps it from being the kind of game it could have been. Only the die hard Star Wars fans would pick this up. For everyone else, be warned as other Star Wars games released for the N64 are much, much better than this somewhat playable effort.	-1
Stay FAR AWAY!  Read comment section below....	-1
Another blast from my past.  No matter how far I got, I could never beat the game completely.  So i figured i'd change that by pairing it up many years later with the game genie and play the game.  Unfortunately, my copy of the game is so distorted from use and abuse, it can't be played.  What little visual I have on screen is just a pixelated blob.  Had the store I bought it from quality checked the item before they sold it online, then this would be a better review.  But, since it cost less than a box of chicken nuggets, I didn't bother and threw it away.	-1
For the past few months I'd been picking up old N64 games that I didn't get a chance to purchase during their initial release, and when I saw Shadows of the Empire I immediately grabbed it, being the big Star Wars fan that I am. Shadows was one of the launch games for the N64, and while it might have been a decent game in its day, maybe even a good game (I can't, however, believe it was ever considered a great game), it hasn't aged well at all. To compare, I also recently grabbed Super Mario 64, the original launch game, and still found plenty of charm left in that old cartridge. The graphics are a mixed bag. Our hero, Dash, is rendered rather nicely, with more polygons than one might expect. The levels, however, have ugly textures that will remind the player of early pseudo 3-D games like DOOM and Dark Forces. Hardly the graphical quality the N64 is capable of. Enemies such as the Stormtroopers and mercenaries are fuzzy with blurred details. However, the graphics on the flying missions and the speeder bike level are exceptional. With regards to sound, John Williams score has never failed before, and fortunately, the music combined with classic Star Wars sound effects is just what Star Wars fans want. Where the game really fails is the gameplay. Shadows tries to include many different modes of play, and not all of them work. The snow speeder level is a classic, as it inspired the game Rogue Squadron; the speeder bike chase is rather cool, as is the fight with Boba Fett. However, in other areas of the game, your craft is stationary and all you are required to do is shoot. It's not much different from the Super Nintendo Star Wars games, and the simplistic gameplay can only entertain for so long. Then there is the first-person levels, which unfortunately make up the bulk of the game. Though the game has multiple view modes, Dash is easiest to control in the first-person mode, but the player won't even see the tip of Dash's gun, as is customary with all shooters. There is no target reticle, making aiming irratic. The levels are too big and empty, and are too straightforward. It's a simple matter to walk from point A to point B, with few surprises. You'll find yourself rushing through most of the game to get to the better levels, but unfortunately they're few and far in between. If you're a Star Wars fan, there's still enough here to warrant a purchase, but mostly it'll be for a piece of N64 Star Wars history. While I might have had different feelings about this game had I bought it at launch, I can't imagine feelings much more impressed by it. Shadows of the Empire is the most disappointing of all the N64 Star Wars games.	-1
And that's being generous. I've never played a more lifeless, dull RPG.  The dialogue comes off as if it was written by an autistic elementary schooler. I understand the sequel is supposed to be much better, but... I'm  afraid I've been scared off for good.	-1
600 bucks? You are out of your damned mind	-1
I don't know if i need to give this game more time but so far it sucks	-1
Its never reissued it doesn't seem !..or else there would be cheaper used copies for common people out there? why only the machines reissued but not the games..then everyone fights over few available copies?? urr disappointing..only ones out there are like 200.00 of some games that are classics..like was so hard to find a copy of  just Mario kart even I finally found a Japanese super famicon which I found out luckily worked on my retro duo super nes/nes console..but geez.. please reissue the classics to make them easier to find to buy??	-1
Spider-Man has been in a lot of games in his career, from his first adventure on the Atari to the recent game for the Playstation. Between the two, this Genesis game came out and it didn't exactly set the gaming world on fire. What you're looking at here is a very average game that doesn't do our friend Spidey justice. The gameplay is just too bland and repetitive for it to be fun. While it does have plenty of his best villians, it doesn't make it any more enjoyable. Graphics are good, sound is okay, but there are better games out there. Sadly, the Playstation Spider-Man game has been the only game to truly capture what Spidey's all about. If you have a Playstation, pick that one up. But for you Genesis owners, you're out of luck.	-1
Mario Kart 64 will always be the best. I don't consider myself fully biased, though. This game really is that bad.	-1
this game was really boring, and was not what I was expecting for a Nintendo game, I would not buy this game for my kids again..	-1
This game has great graphics, an excellent 16-bit redo of the original soundtrack, and an overall awesome game. But after the famous title sequence ended and the game started, I was left in frustration. Level one put me against thousands of dinosaurs, scorpions, and worms. After 30 unsuccessful minutes, I used the flawed Game Genie ram editor to give myself invincibility, and level 1 became a snap. Level two started. I was put in mode 7 with a land speeder, not good considering the age of the game. The clunky land speeder vehicle could hardly aim at the Jawas, and once I shot all 10 of them I zoomed towards the sand crawler. Level 3 begins. It was an awful platformer with enemies that knock you back to the ground. Luke can't even jump high enough to reach half the platforms. Even with the Genie granting my wishes, it was still an impossible mess!!!	-1
IT WORKS , BUT IS VERY VERY DAMAGE .SO I GIVE 1 STAR. I WILL PREFER GETTING A CLEAN ONE SO THE COVER WILL LAST . IT WOULD BE BETTER IDEA JUST TO PAY FOR A NEW GAME. I DONT KNOW IF THE SELLER WILL READ THIS. HOPE HE DOES.	-1
When Mortal Kombat 1 was released on the arcades nearly a decade ago, it immediately became a HUGE hit. It was so realistic, and the hand-to-hand combat style was so extreme. The game also centered around controversy due to the incredibly unique violent content. Fans anxiously awaited for the game's arrival on home video game consoles. When it was released to the Super Nintendo, fans wasted no time purchasing it. However, the happy fans were quickly disappointed when they discovered Mortal Kombat to be edited. Thanks to Acclaim and Nintendo, this game has NO blood & guts! The fatalities are edited and toned down. The blood has been changed to sweat. MK fans were ripped off and very angry about the censorship in the game. At least the Sega Genesis version of MK had a blood code. The Super Nintendo version plays a lot like the arcade hit. The graphics, sound, music, and animation play equivelant to the arcade. But without the bloody violence and original fatalities, it's just not the same. This is still an okay fighting game though, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. Too bad it's so old. I could do without it. MK II and MK III are a heck of a lot better. Don't waste your money on this. Rent it if you can.	-1
Mortal Kombat was really weak on the SNES because it was so censored. No blood, some people had different fatalities (ex: Johnny Cage's foot in your stomach). Blood was traded for sweat (?!?!) and because of those 2 reasons, the game was truly brought down a notch. Yes it's still a classic but it's not worth it on SNES. You're better off getting it on the SEGA system because that way you could overcome the censorship and at least put in a "blood code". Personally, I'd skip this one anyday and go straight to MK II because that was just all out better than MK and it was a lot more enjoyable, had better replay and a lot more characters. Trust me, skip MK on SNES and go straight for MK II on SNES.	-1
Nothing at all like the SNES version. Bad graphics,limited character roster,limited moves and danger moves,unresponsive controls,dreadful sound....just all around bad. I wouldn't wish this port of KI on my worst enemy. What a terrible disgrace to such a great game.	-1
What can I say, this game was dumb!  It's just a copycat of Mario Kart 64 and Mario Kart 64 has freakin' fun!  Diddy Kong Racing is a joke!  I would have rated it as "0 stars," but unfortunately I don't have that option.  If you want to give someone a hate gift, I recommend this.  But don't blame me if they surprisingly love it.	-1
Don't get me wrong, its an ok game, its kinda fun, at the same time I don't see why this game is so amazing. The music is suppose to be good, I thought it didn't do the SNES sound chip any justice. Gameplay is quite repetitive, I know a lot of games can be repetitive but its a repition that bores me. Your constantly locating stuff, that got boring. But I will say, if I was bored or just killing time before I go out it would be good for a few rounds to play. The story line is pretty impressive, so I guess the game deserves props in that area. The game is good in its own little ways, but I just don't rank it up there with some of the other classics. I have some friends that love this game, so I guess I respect it for what it is.	-1
Please don't get extremist on me, but I don't really like this game. It's overrated and I will stick to the first Legend of Zelda that's way better than this! Newer Zelda games are NOT my thing.	-1
This game plays ok, but Nintendo caved to media pressure and edited most of the best content out of the game.  This game feels neutered.  It is like buying a music album you really like from a great artist only to find out you bought the radio edit version instead of the explicit version.  Granted a lot of games that were ported from an arcade console to the SNES system had to be altered to fit the parameters of the system, but this game could have left in the gore and everything else.  This is one of those rare times where Sega got it right and Nintendo goofed it up.  One of my favorite parts of the game was playing against other people and ripping off their heads at the end of a battle.  None of that in this version.  I feel like it should have a Care Bears sticker on it or something to let  buyers know this is the G rated version.  There is still some slow lag issues in the game and some bugs here and there.  The play control has some issues it does not seem fluid.  I would stick to only playing this game in the arcade for the true overall experience, that way you can see why everyone enjoyed it so much.  The endurance rounds provide a nice challenge that would be the only thing this game does better than MK2.  Other than that the sequel was superior in every way.  Seeing the classic characters is nostalgic and brings back a lot of memories.	-1
It was ok.	-1
AS I ASKED, WHO IN HIS/HER RIGHT MIND WOULD BUY THIS FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS?!!!  I'll admit that I'm a fan of Transformers & would buy any of them without a second thought.  But Power Rangers?!!  It's not worth a thousand dollars; 5 dollars at the most and that's pushing it.	-1
I never got into the hype of Mortal Kombat when it came out in arcades; it was good on arcade while the game lasted and then shipped to SEGA and SNES. Playing it on SNES was pretty boring for me for three reasons. One was the lack of blood. It was probably the most interesting feature of the arcade game. Two was the controller problem. I could never get a lot of moves done the way I asked for. Three was the sheer boredom of it. The game is very one dimensional for me. There is not much to do except memorize the combo moves for each player and then the fatality move. After them, there is nothing else anymore. The tournament is interesting, but once the ladder is climbed to the top, that's it. There isn't much to be said. All in all, Mortal Kombat doesn't cut it for me.	-1
Because you need something like that to make this game interesting and enjoyable; because its that bad!!!!!!!!!!  Seriously this game sucks, the graphics were great for the 16-BIT, the sound isn't all that bad, and that's were it stops. The gameplay is full of glitches and other issues. There is no blood, though you'll see a lot of sweat, maybe some tears, but no blood. You can't leave that out of the deal, also the game was just censored to death. The combination of the bad gameplay, and lack of originality that should have come from the arcades killed this version! I remember you could trip someone half way across the screen!? ;( Its just a dumb game.  If you wanna make it good like I said in the begining get some beer and other things, possibly get drunk, and then maybe you might find it entertaining. Other than that avoid this one, but check out the sequel.	-1
I missed the original Mortal Kombat in arcades, and was introduced to the series through word-of-mouth about how violent the title was. Really if this was the only version I'd played, I would've never gussed what all the hype was about.  Graphics and audio are pretty good, far surpassing what the Genesis version was offering and staying pretty true to the arcade version. Gameplay however, is a failure. Nevermind that the fatalities have been changed and the blood turned to sweat - the actual fighting is stiff and unresponsive, and it feels like the fighters have their feet glued to the floor. The only move that works well here is Scorpion's spear, and it's so smooth in its execution that it becomes the best way of landing cheap hits.  Look at MK objectively: bad controls, less characters than Street Fighter, less moves, a limited number of environments with no background animation (though the Pit idea was rather cool). The first installment was truly one that sold based on the strength of its gore, and on the SNES we're deprived of that as well.  MK fans might or might not want this version for completion purposes (since it looks graphically like the arcade but removes all the violent content). Everyone else should jump to MKII, which really got the series started.	-1
Initially "Saga Frontier" is quite interesting, but unfortunately it quickly bogs down from there.  The game offers seven different characters in seven different stories (some of which are actually quite interesting); this is a very neat idea, but the action gets repetitive after exploring the same area in different stories.  The fight action is interesting at first, but this too gets repetitive in a rather short time.  One thing I did like was the backgrounds; some of them were just beautifully rendered.  Unfortunately the character/monster graphics just did not fit in with the background; they were two different styles that just did not mesh well with each other.  If the game had offered a better combat engine and more unique areas for each character, "Saga Frontier" would have been a pretty good game.	-1
This game has no sense of linearity to it at all... You spend most of the game trying to figure out where to go next, and mostly being wrong. I can't even really say this game was remotely fun to play. In fact, the only reason I kept playing was because I was hoping to find some kind of story hidden in this madness... but I didn't. The game boasts seven different main characters, all with their own backgrounds and skills. You can play the game as any one of them, while meeting the rest along the way. The problem is that all the intertwining story-lines get so crosswired that after a while you don't remember who's character you are really playing, and what your original goal was. In the same respect, the game is huge. Once you get past a certain stage, the entire world is left before you, and you can go where you want, and do what you want, without having to stay within the confines of your particular storyline. Some people may like this freedom, but I found it annoying! I love the idea of being able to explore the world on my own, but I never had a sense of purpose throughout the game. I never really knew where to go next, and every time I went to a new city I just felt like I was going around in circles and not making any progress. Needless to say, I haven't completed this game, and I don't plan on it anytime soon. This game is just bad! If you want to wander aimlessly around a series of cartoony cities, each with hidden dungeons and shops and no sense of purpose whatsoever, then by all means get this game. I for one would rather spend my money on a nice root canal, or perhaps a spinal tap.	-1
This was the most boring game I've ever bought.  Don't let the description of multiple games with multiple characters fool you.  It's one game that you go through with various times with different characters.  The valiant  effort of a very non-linear storyline was marred by the fact that it was so  non-linear that the stories were often left being incoherent.  It's tedious  going through the same mini-quests over and over.  Most of the characters  could have been a good choice to have their own full game. This was a  good idea, playing through multiple games where you meet up with past  characters that you played, but the games needs a huge overhaul in order to  give it more variety. If you have a LOT of time to kill and are very  easily amused and find this game for very cheap, give it a whirl.  Otherwise, find a decent game or play Final Fantasy VII for the 10th time.  It will be much more interesting.	-1
Doesn't match the pic and I don't remember any mention of this by the seller, Again European version. I'm sure it would work on a European SNES.	-1
They should've made this game like the 2 before it. They just made it too complex and un donkey kong ya know what i mean? Its ok at first, but it gets boring too fast. ( at least it's not nearly as bad as DK64 )	-1
definitely came in rough shape the sticker practically peeling off the game and when you put the game it doesn't even work! sold me a broken game!	-1
This is one of the most overrated games of the Mario series. First of all, it's extremely difficult and frustrating. There's always been a problem with Mario games concerning the controls, they're slippery and not responsive enough for the difficulty of the game. Also the fact that the only attack Mario can do is jump on his enemies, at least in this game which isn't enough arsenal for the amount of enemies that are set against you at one time (armies of them). I know people who have been stuck on the same level for years and it makes me wonder why people bother with this game.  Another dire problem is the process of saving your game. The game only lets you save at designated points instead of saving at the completion of each level which again makes this game seem frustrating when you complete a substantial amount of the game and suddenly die and get sent back five to eight levels for losing all your lives.  I would've given the game 2 stars for the graphics alone which look somewhat advanced for 1991 but there are so many games from the 16 bit era that surpassed it that I'm going to ignore the graphics in this review because they simply don't make up for its lack of detail and intuitiveness in everything else. In comparison to Donkey Kong Country and Sonic The Hedgehog 3 this game is dwarfed for its graphics. Another reason to overlook the graphics is the blending of levels in which the same type of level looks nearly identical to every level of its kind.  And let's not forget the overrated soundtrack. The music is dull, repetitive, and juvenile and not in good way. It's not uncommon to hear the same music being played for three or more consecutive levels which is  ridiculous because they didn't even do this on the NES.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm a casual Nintendo fan who immensely enjoyed other games on the Super Nintendo and Nintendo games on newer consoles, Super Mario World isn't one of them because it's frustrating and it sucks.	-1
People say this game is great. To what extent? its great horrendousness? if that is the case, then yes. this game is so hard and cant be beat unless cheated after world 6, the game is impossible. just stick with sonic on sega genesis. the graphics look like the NES, even genesis is better. just don't waste time with a snes console or games.	-1
The fact that those two wrestlers aren't in this version of WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game is reason enough to avoid it.  Yoko Zuna is a big guy with very powerful moves, and Bam Bam is yet another big guy.  It's odd how they didn't include either of the two BIG guys on the Super NES.  It's not like this game has a lot of options and wrestlers anyway, so to take away two wrestlers and leave you with only six is just ridiculous.  Get the Playstation version.	-1
So i bought this game, and when i recieved it, it was tucked away in a paper envelope, just the disk and nothing else.....and lo and behold, when i take it out, it has a huge crack in it making it unplayable, so not only did i have to pay for an unplayable copy of it, i had to pay for a brand new copy of it at $25. I might review the game when i actually play it, but don't buy it without a case, make sure when you order it, it comes in some kind of protective casing, not just a disk in a sleeve  Actual Game Review: Duke is still the man, even today Score: 5 out of 5  Ok, the only DN game i ever played fully was Duke Nukem Zero Hour, so i decided to try antoher one, and TTK seemed like a great choice since it resembled Zero Hour.....and it's just as awesome, the weapons are amazing with my personal favorite being the shotgun and the level design is fun and not to repetitive. Graphics wise it's not that bad, but it's a PS1 game from 1996, but graphics don't make the game, look at Metal Gear or Resident Evil, and Duke Nukem is just as fun as those two. If you're an action game fan, a Duke Nukem fan, or just want pure action, big explosions, bigger guns and Duke with an even bigger ego, check this game out.	-1
This game was a real let-down for me. I really dislike the 3rd person camera. And it takes me forever to aim. I own all duke nukem games and this is the worst. Look for something else.	-1
I sadly remember the day when this game was released.  I had waited long enough, and finally I had the game in my hands.  I remember being so excited until about 1 hour into the game.  It was then that I realized that  this game was terrible. The graphics were nice, and the cut scenes were  above average.  The voices sounded good, and the combat was a little fast,  but adequate. But I wasn't having fun.  I realized that the game was  pretty deep, and dwelling deeper into the game's cool storyline would  require more of the bad AI, terrible - I mean HORRIBLE combat system, and  scrappy mouse driven interface.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I wished I  could just watch the game instead of play it, then I would of been  happy. I did what I had to do, and finally uninstalled it.  I thought of  all the money I spent, and went to find another game.  What a tradgedy that  a game with that much potential had to be ruined by an obvious rushed  product.  If your a gamer who likes fast action and addicting gameplay,  then go buy Icewind Dale or Diablo 2, not this game.	-1
How many times do we have to tell game designers that game saves are an integral part of any game. Game designers, this is a PC game you're designing and not a console game.  Let's start with the bad points as Im  sure all the readers would like to read first. The game committed the most  sinful act of not providing a save game feature accessible anytime and  anywhere in the game. You could only save the game when it loads a new  scene or level. I was in a dungeon for 2 hours (real-time), dying, and I  couldn't save the game because you have to walk out of the dungeon to make  the game reload the level and save your points. This is crazy! This is an  RPG we're playing here. I mean, Final Fantasy III (console game) had built  in save points in the dungeons. Why cant a PC game like this have one? This  is a real turn-off. Next is the interface. I still have to figure out how  to properly move the character. It's so hard to control the camera as you  move the character in the game. The view pans out then suddenly pans in.  The game tried to make its interface unique and it ended up making the game  more complex. Graphics are good. Nice colors, voice acting was ok. You need  a good sized system though to run this game like a PIII 600 and 32mb video  card. Story: well, this game completely ignored the pen and paper version  with too many battles in it. I beat the game in 30 hours. So there really  isn't much there to expect. Will you buy this game? I say, don't buy it until  they patch the game with a save feature. If you're after a RPG, then look  somewhere else.	-1
I am a huge fan of vampire fiction in any form and also enjoy a good RPG.  So I was ecstatic when I heard about Vampire being translated from the pen-and-paper sources to the computer.  And Vampire is an amazing looking  game that I really wanted to like.  Unfortunately some bad design choices  and poor features prevented it from happening. I'll start with the good  points.  The graphics are stunningly amazing.  The animation of the  characters is fluid and weapons are superbly done.  The lighting greatly  enhances the dark and sinister atmosphere.  I kept going in many places  because I wanted to see what area I would visit next.  The camera control  is also very smooth and easy to manipulate with the mouse.  The gameplay is  actually fun for the first bit of the game while you are adventuring by  yourself and with one other party member.  The source material and the  manual add a lot to this game.  Wandering around towns and seeing people  milling about made it feel alive.  And it was always oh so fun to feed upon  someone to refill your blood level. The RPG system is also great.  There  are several positive and detrimenatl traits for the characters.  A certain  level of blood must be maintained to use the disciplines (spells/skills)  and to keep your character from succombing to frenzy.  Experience points  can be distributed among such traits as strength, dexterity, intelligence,  willpower and several others.  Very nicely done indeed. Here is where I  have to get in to the demerits of this game.  First off, the voice acting  is not very good; but it's not the worst I've heard either.  And the  sequences of dialogue are long and boring.  The characters simply stand in  place and wave their hands about.  NPC interaction is left to a few  choices which really have little baring on the outcome of the game.  Nothing as rich and detailed as Planescape: Torment. The combat, while  fun and reminiscent of Diablo, only keeps its spark for the first part of  the game.  Most of it consists of clicking on an enemy and waiting until  you've hit them enough times for them to die.  A big flaw that becomes  noticable during the first few levels is that the enemies wait until you  are in range before they attack.  They will simply stand idle as you  slaughter others in the same room!  As the game progresses you will gain  party members, and will bemoan similarly incompetant AI.  I equipped one  with a bow and laughed in disbelief as he continuously fired in to a wall  when he should have moved a couple steps to the side before doing so.  Also, you can control the other members of your party in combat, but the  main character will stop fighting while you are doing so!  Aaahhhh!  Add to  this that you can go through entire areas and clean up with little to no  problem, but then come across certain areas that will be nigh impossible to  pass.  Both enemies and your fellow party members will get hung up on  walls, doors and other obstacles in the room. And here we come to the  worst sin of the game, the save system.  Saving is automatically handled  when you transition between levels are areas.  The only other way to save  is to be in your haven or safe area.  One can get there by using the Walk  the Abyss discipline (aka spell/skill).  But it takes a while before you  have one of these in a given area.  So we are left hacking our way back  through areas and levels already completed.  I found myself abusing the  autosave feature by running back and forth between levels to save.  But  what if more than one person is playing the game as is the case on my  computer?  It's pretty much tough luck.  This is a computer game, not a  console.  The game should have been balanced so that players could save  anywhere at anytime. The multiplayer sounds enticing with the ability for  one person to take control of the NPCs and monsters.  But if the gameplay  is similar to the single-player then I can't see it being much  better. With great graphics, a rich source material and so much  potential.  It makes me sad to not be able to like this game.  This takes  me back to Revenant, another game with a lot of potential but came up  flacid.  Maybe the patches will fix the problems, I certainly hope so.  But  much has to be done for the AI to make this game worthy.	-1
Given the pre-release hype from game sites, I was really anticipating this game as the contender for the best RTS this year. I'm pretty disappointed. The good first: The game looks very nice. It has that same  techno-organic look as Battlezone 2, not surprising since the same guys did  it. It runs fairly nice, aside from the crashes. The framerate and overall  running is probably the smoothest I've ever seen on a 3D RTS, even  Homeworld. The interface is also quite well thought out, and a step forward  over other 3D RTS's, particularly the ease of camera movement. Other than  that, the game is a dog. Sorry, fanboys, but I have to call it like I see  it. Gameplay is a real snoozer: Tons of dicking around and not much combat.  Everything is just deliberately slow--aircraft move as slowly as infantry  on foot, et cetera. If you are looking for fast, furious, exciting  gameplay, this is not the place to find it. The unit pathfinding is set  up in such a way that they all move one at a time so that they don't  obstruct each other. Thus, you'll move one unit, and if any others are in  its way they will all, agonizingly, move one at a time to new positions so  the mover can get through. In any movement of groups this problem is ten  times as bad. You'll watch in frustration as your units get ripped to  shreds while they stupidly maneuver into position before they start  returning fire. No real story is going on here; there are no characters  and nothing happens inside of a mission to alter the plot. There are some  vague cutscenes between the missions, but they're so irrelevant that you  could have just played the missions and made up your own story to string  them together. Overall, I regret having bought the game. I can't  recommend it unless you're compelled to get an RTS fix.	-1
Why do I rate this game 1 star? There are several reasons. First and foremost, there is NO SAVEPOINT. In short, you'll have to beat this game in ONE SITTING. Talk about patience. The second major problem that I have with this game is that it is trying to do too much. It is a top-down shooter AND a first-person shooter. The graphics in the top-down mode are fine, but the graphics and textures in FP mode are DREADFUL. Doom has FAR better variety, texture-wise. Personally, I got headaches after playing in FP mode after 30 minutes--and remember, you can't save. So the bottom line is this, if you want to kill dinosaurs, I'd recommend Jurassic Park for the old NES and the Carnivores series for PC. N64 has a Turok the Dinosaur Hunter series out. Pass this game, you'll be glad you did.	-1
It's not X. I don't know what they were thinking when they released this piece of garbage. X is a monster in this game and he sounds like an ass.	-1
(This review was updated on July 10th, 2006)  I've changed my mind about Super Mario World and actually think it deserves 4 stars.  I was just in a bad mood when I originally gave the game a 2-star rating.  It turns out Super Mario World is not just a game you can enjoy growing up in the early 90's.  It actually has a lot of replay value and years later our children can enjoy Super Mario World the same way WE did.  I still stand by what I say in the original review: "The Donkey Kong Country series, for example, came along with a similar idea and made it more exciting IMO, so, if I were you I'd go with one of those games instead of Super Mario World.  For the most part the levels in the DKC series feel different from each other (plus, they feel more creative and memorable).  Unfortunately, many of the levels in Super Mario World are all basically the same and, as a result, I feel exhausted after playing the game for two hours.  To put it another way- in Super Mario World it feels like you're going through the levels simply to collect coins and extra lives.  In the Donkey Kong Country series, you pretty much do the same thing (except bananas instead of coins) but it seems like the DKC series offers more creativity in the level design, which allows you to look forward to each stage and think to yourself "I wonder what cool thing I get to do in THIS stage".  It's not like that in Super Mario World."  I still believe that, but I've recently come to change my mind a little and think that, even though most of the levels in Super Mario World feel the same, that's not necessarily a BAD thing.  I also don't think the graphics in SMW are as nice as many reviewers think.  They sort of look blocky but, to their credit, Nintendo games have always had plenty of pretty colors, which is a plus.  So go ahead and buy Super Mario World if you want to experience the joy of old-school Mario (the games MY generation grew up with).  After all, it's Mario and Mario games always have something decent going for them (except Mario Is Missing, but with time we've come to realize that game never even existed!)  Super Mario World is basically Super Mario Bros. 3 (but without all the cool Mario suits and less creative worlds).  I like in Super Mario Bros. 3 how you have water, desert, air, plant and ice worlds (in addition to more).  In Super Mario World you just have UNUSUAL worlds such as Chocolate Island and Forest of Illusion.  Those aren't as neat as the worlds in Super Mario Bros. 3.  Super Mario World should have been the best Mario game yet but Nintendo took a few steps back (but with a MONSTER like Super Mario Bros. 3 I guess it would have been difficult to make a better Mario game right after it).  Another problem in Super Mario World is that if you want to get a perfect score (96) you not only have to reach the goal in every single level, but you also have to find and grab a key in certain levels (but not all levels have keys).  This means you have to go through many levels a SECOND time.  It's sort of boring.  Once is enough.  The concept of collecting keys wasn't a good one.  I guess the good part is that if you are wearing a cape, you can quickly fly through the levels (except for water levels, and any level where the screen pushes you to the right) but that's not fun either because all you do is continue flying and pushing the back button to stay up high in the air until you reach the goal (or the key).  However, at the end of the day none of this is really enough to make the game bad in any way.  I just get tired of it.  Go ahead and get it.  Yes, it's a classic.	-1
This review is hard to write because I am so mad that I wasted my money on this game. Oh whoopie, you can play as Zero the fighter, butt zero is how much I should've payed for this game. There isn't one thing about this game that I like. The story [is bad] and the fight and graphics are absolutely awful. If you want a real game, don't waste your money on this. Don't even rent this game. This game is so bad it make Pong look good.	-1
this game is two hard for younger kid to navigate , and it is a little hard for them to understand how to play it. But the graphic are good.	-1
the game came in and had another persons name in white out on it and didn't even work. waist of my cash.	-1
This X game was just tedious.  I remember the original X game on the SNES was fun, as were X2 and X3, but this one was just bad.  Playing as X or Zero was fun, but Zero was hard to control and both storylines were, well, boring.  I was almost to the point of yawning.  Plus, it was easy to figure out who the final boss was for anyone who has ever played an X game.  Additionally, some of the upgrades to Xs armor made him harder to operate, and, well, I guess what I really want to say is this was boring.  I was bored stiff.  I couldn't wait to beat it so I could move on to something else.  Unlike X, X2 and X3, there is almost no replay value in this game.  I mean, beyond the cheat codes for the special X armor and Dark Zero, nothing.  I only hope that X5 and X6 are better, but I'm not sure if they will be.	-1
I think the game play is great the music was good but the main thing that made me give this a low rating are none other than the lacking of the graphics they are absolutely horrible and it makes it really hard to see where you going sometimes.  Well thats all I got to say, This game would have been great if it weren't for the attrocious graphics and I think the PC version was alot better.	-1
Next to Sega CD the worst version of DOOM.  The graphics suck and you can barely tell what anything is, the sound is decent (the one star), the controls are horrid, the gameplay is horrid and the shores of hell freezes up on start, so all you really have is a butchered port of Knee Deep & Inferno with horrid controls.  Terrible.	-1
First of all, Here are the PROS and CONS  PROS:  Good for the people who own a SNES, not PC.  CONS:  really bad graphics.  slower animation than PC.  you can't save the game.  It is shorter than the PC version of doom.  Overall: 0.9  This is a pretty good game, but not for SNES!  Get it on PC. That version is alot better.	-1
What a disgrace to Marvel. Neither Spidey nor the X-Men come out of this with integrity left. It's seriously one of the worst games I have ever played on the Genesis. Terrible graphics, worse gameplay and awful music. Don't be like me and assume that it must be good because Spidey is involved. I guess I should have researched it first coz it seriously is a bad, bad game.  It is sort of a cross between a side-scrolling beat-em-up and a run-and-gun game, but succeeds at neither.  It really just feels like any other generic platformer that was reskinned as a Marvel game halfway through development as very little of the gameplay feels unique to the characters. Why is Spidey jumping up ledges to climb buildings? Why is he not wall-crawling? There is some crawling, but it feels like an afterthought. The character sprites are small and puny with little weight to the animation or impact to the action, and the level design is haphazard, repetitive and generic. Sometimes you'll even have difficulty identifying exactly what the environment is supposed to be. As for the music, well...it's not memorable. It's just noise, honestly.  Stay away!	-1
I bought this game a long time ago when it first came out.  I wish I would have rented it first but I bought it anyway because it had Spiderman and the X-Men in it.  I have to say this game is just weak in all aspects of the game.  The levels are boring and unimaginative and the characters and bosses are dull.  I DON'T recommend this game at all.	-1
While this is a terrific game concept with some nice features, it is far more work than play. The core of the game is a standard 4X space empire builder, with colony management, a complex tech tree, tactical space and  ground combat, espionage, and diplomacy. But there is no centralized  display of colony status. A building must be supplied with both power and  workers in order to operate, and if it doesn't have enough of either, it  will simply shut down and the game gives you no warning or announcements.  You are forced to pause the game every few months and personally inspect  every single colony to discover these problems. But the tech system is even  worse, and has not been improved from IG1. There are three types of tech,  and so you have to have three types of labs. But you can only research one  invention at a time, so while you're developing a new hyperdrive in your  ship labs, your ground unit and colony facility labs are sitting idle,  sucking up your colony's power and workers. If you can't afford that waste,  and most of the time you can't, you have to once again personally remember  where you placed each one of up to 30 labs, go to the colony display for  each planet on which you have a lab, and turn the idle ones off, one at a  time. If you decide to develop a new building next, you have to go around  and turn off all the ship labs and turn all the building labs on again. And  I don't have room here to go into the game's futile diplomacy system, or  the sluggish screen redraw, or the constant nagging interruptions by  messages regarding random events and spies demanding orders. No offense to  the other reviewers here, but only a hardcore strategy addict with a fetish  for micromanagement could enjoy this game. I returned it four days after I  bought it.	-1
Froze every 2 seconds and that's If I was lucky enough to get it started. Good condition was hardly the correct description for this game.	-1
I play a great many strategy games and I consider myself to be a fairly decent player, though not great by any means. On the one hand, I truly enjoy playing IG2.  The mechanisms of planet building and support, the ship design, the research tree, and the general interface are all excellent and make the game a pleasure to play.  Or would if the difficulties (easy, normal, hard) were actually indicative of anything. When I play a game on easy, I expect to learn how to play and very likely win on my first try.  In IG2, the easy was so easy, I won before I really felt I had a handle on the game. Normal level should be a challenge.  I should need to play well, and in the end, I should still only win about half the time.  I've lost count of how many times on "normal" (as the Solarians) I have not even come close to winning.  I get wiped out every time by a Kra'Hen fleet so large I can't even conceive of what I would need to do to make one half its size.  Sometimes I die even sooner. Goodness forbid that I even try to play on "hard" difficulty. For any normal game, I have come to expect that the "hard" difficulty to really be "nearly impossible".  In IG2, normal mode does this, and I feel the game is hardly worth the trouble as a result. I have tried as the Shinarians as well, with similar results. In conclusion, while I truly liked the game architecture, I cannot recommend this to anyone.  I found this to be one of the most frustrating games I have played in quite some time.	-1
What the people who praise this POS software bundle don't tell you is that there hasn't been an update to download for over a year, and there probably won't ever be another one! The TRUTH is that it only runs a few games... None of which anywhere on par with a real PSX! It's a complete waste of money unless your some techhead who wants to marvel at it's shortcomings! Get Conectix VGS if your looking for a Playstation emulator on PC! ...What good is 3d card capabilities if it doesn't run any games to begin with?	-1
The game idea was good, but the running and loading lock up the computer or slows it to a crawl.	-1
Although this game has different playability than Risk 1 and good graphics, it is the cheatenist game I've ever played, it is nigh impossible to win these games, except only occasionally, and by then you are too worn out from trying to win to enjoy it. I would not bother with it, stick with Risk 1, the original. I'm an old risk player from way back, I used to play the board game with my brother in law many years ago, and I have the pc version of original Risk,and even though that game cheats as do all computer games, it's not near half as bad as risk 2.	-1
This version of Risk I thought was an overall bad idea because it just played of the original.  furthermore,  the original RISK 1 disk was more than good enough in every department.  The company who released this video game was just trying to "update" the game in which didn't needed to be updated.  bad job over all	-1
this game is too old to work on todays OS's. After many attempts with dos-box and other emulation software I gave up.  I did however get it to start...once....but it locked up and pixelated, then crashed with a fatal error.	-1
so I looked online and it says that those of you hearing little rattles inside, yes that's also a battery thing. guess that's why it was glitching out and wouldn't save. I don't have the ability to replace it. or work on this game at all. this looks like a shipping problem to me.	-1
I thought originally the size of the files for the game just wouldn't load onto my laptop with a lot of space was taken. Now I have a brand new desk top and the disk will not even begin to upload on to the desktop.  Second game I have got from online that didn't work.	-1
This game was not easy to see and very boring	-1
Works well	-1
It really is a shame...  This game was so close to being awesome, but, like just about every other Lucasfilm game (except Super Empire Strikes Back on SNES), it fails in its execution. I'll start with the positives though.  The graphics are excellent, though the characters may appear just SLIGHTLY dated.  They animate very well, having been motion-captured.  The backgrounds are awesome, and so is the music.  Of course, you can't go wrong with Star Wars when it comes to graphics and music anyway.  The character voices are even cool as they sound just like their actor counterparts. However, the gameplay... this, unfortunately, is what ruins it.  Now, there are some cool features here such as a free running mode which makes the game truly 3D like Bushido Blade (and unlike the pseudo 3D of Tekken, for instance).  There is also a limited guard meter (like Street Fighter Alpha 3), which prevents turtling.  Unfortunately though, these nice features are overshadowed by very serious flaws.  First of all, the are the motion-captured moves.  While they look great, they're also extremely jerky when translated to the game.  They are also plagued with horrible lag and recovery times.  Even a simple jab leaves you open for all sorts of counterattacks.  The other problem is the control: it flows like 3-year-old Heinz ketchup.  There is no hope of stringing any moves together because the game cancels out all additional button presses from the moment you start a move all the way until your character completely recovers at the end of the move.  This wouldn't be so bad, except for the previously mentioned problem: extremely slow recovery times.  In fact, the lag time for throwing a swing is longer than the recovery time from getting hit by one!  This means that you hit the opponent with your strongest move, and they recover from it before you do. The most annoying problem though, by far, is the sidestepping.  Though this may be a cool feature, it is also horribly abused.  The computer AI seems to have an obsession with it, sidestepping constantly (I've timed it--they never go more than 2 seconds without sidestepping, even when they aren't being attacked).  Now, this doesn't sound like much, but it really is a huge problem.  The constant sidestepping also rotates the game's camera.  This makes the computer impossible to hit with any straightforward attack because you are never properly aligned with them.  Combine this with the slow recovery times, and you'll run into situations like this:  You smack the enemy with the first hit in a combo which, logically, should set him up for the next hit, right?  Wrong.  Because of the unbalanced recovery times, he'll recover before your second swing ever comes out, and he'll sidestep, then stand there watching as you go off swinging at the air in some odd direction.  Then he'll automatically turn to face you and hit you in the back of the head (since your character takes forever to re-align himself properly when he isn't facing the opponent--another design flaw).  The constant camera rotation (or, swirling, to be more precise) makes you lose all orientation on the playing field.  Add to this archaic features such as "Ring Out" (which should have gone out in the Jurassic period of fighting games), and you have an unplayable, nerve-wracking mess.  Basically, you will lose many matches from being smacked in the back of the head as the computer rotated the camera on you, or by cheap Ring Outs because you couldn't see where you were on the battlefield (again, because the computer rotated the camera on you). I'm not particularly a fan of 3D fighters, and this game reminds me of why.  Stay away from this one.  If you're not a Star Wars fan, it's just a bad fighting game.  If you are a Star Wars fan, that will make you even more disappointed in this title.	-1
This is a terrible game but good for the star wars collector now that everything in it is non canon.	-1
I was unimpressed with this game. The races are too similar to each other. The ships within each race do not differ much except in size. Mouse control is painfully sluggish. Space is two-dimensional - ...Resource collection is uncreative. Several ship classes are missing, such as the Intrepids. Only 8 ships can be selected at a time. Whether I played the Borg or the Federation, I got the feeling that I was just building the same things with different graphics in a [copy] of Starcraft. Generally, a rather half-hearted effort at a real-time strategy game. It's not bad, really, it's just that there are much better games out there. Like Armada II.	-1
The graphics are smooth and intense.  The controls, even though initially confusing, are pretty good.  I've gotten pretty far in this game as well (8 out of 10 levels completed) after playing many, many hours on this  game. Sound good, right?  Wrong!  The difficulty of the Dreamcast version  is terrible.  I had been in the console/computer game business a while  back, and one of the main flaws I noticed is that computer game developers  are hardcore gamers, developing games for hardcore gamers.  This is a  classic example. ... Given enough time, many  people could pass this game.  However, there are limits.  After all, it's  just a game, and should only take a maximum 100 hours to complete. This is  well beyond the 100 hours. Unless you live and breathe video games and  you find ninety-nine percent of all games too easy, stick to another game.  I cannot stress this enough!  It is nearly impossible to complete for any  normal person!	-1
This game is the typical "grab headlines and not deliver" that I'm coming to expect from Lucasarts. This is an RTS 2 years behind in Technology. I've never understood how the Empire couldn't have a  battlefield mapped, yet the "ZERO FIELD OF VISION" persists in  this game. The controls are twitchy, and the graphics are can't even  compete with lower class RTS games like Metal Fatigue. I bought the game  b/c I'm a fan, but I'd rather spend my time reading the novels than play  this poorly done amateurish shrink wrapped goop.	-1
Every time I have bought an activision game I have loved it. But Armada is not a game like that. Its major faluts are:bugs(it crashes every few minitues) AI (the computer has yet to beat me) patches (Activision stopped makeing patches!) and that it requres a fast computer to run well. However the graphics are good and it is fun when it isn't crashing. Buy this only if you are a trekke and rich.	-1
Hey I'm a bit of a Trekkie, but this games is something of a (terrible) dissapointment.  Is it just me, or are a lot of people trying to make money utilizing the magnificent star trek universe? Don't waste your money on this :(	-1
I am a true Star Wars fan and I collect everything and love all the movies but this was definatley not an enjoyable game.  Sadley the gameplay did not come natural, so there was a learning curve.  The graphics were behind the times and character movement was horribloe.  I even often found AT-ST getting stuck up against a wall and unmoveable - a total frustrating moment.  Yes this is Star Wars and yes it is great on that respect.  However compare it to any RTS that came out a few years prior to it and you would be still dissapointed.  I'm sure Lucasarts will try again soon, hopefully...	-1
The Good: For the first time, command Star Wars Imperial and Rebellion units in real time.  The sound is truly the most excellent part of the game; the unit sounds are fantastic, and the metal-ized version of the  Imperial Theme is a nice touch.  Graphics are a bit dated, but I feel  they've done a good job with what they had, using a dated 3D engine. The  Bad: The main menu and the user interface for controlling your force  looks extremely tacked-on in a last-minute fashion, and should have been  done much better.  The interface makes controlling units a chore.  This is  a common deficiency in recent LucasArts games, though.  The 3D perspective  takes time to master, and until you do master it, you'll lose alot.  This  combined with the interface reduces you to alot of micromanagement, which  can get problematic. The worst aspect of the game is how resources are  derived.  The game works on a system of "command points", whereby  you are rewared with the capability to purchase more resources when you are  succesful in combat.  This sounds like it might have been innovative, but  in this implementation what happens both in the single player and  multiplayer game is that the player (or computer) who wins early skirmishes  gets access to greater numbers of units and advancements, thus quickly  overwhelming their opponent.  This condition, where the outcome is decided  from the start and you've virtually no way to recover from an early falter,  causes frustration and represents to me poor design. If you are an  absolute freak about Star Wars, you might enjoy this game because you'll be  able to re-enact the battle of Hoth and other scenarios.  If however you  want an excellent real-time strategy game, try Starcraft or Age of Empires  II.  If you want strategy in 3D, Homeworld is also an excellent bet.	-1
This game, while a decent port from the PS version as far as a port goes, is very frustrating.  First it's difficult to learn and play, and the graphics sometimes makes gameplay even more difficult.  (BTW, it's not really scary.)  The most annoying thing for PC gamers is you can't save the game at any point.  Instead there are only a limited number of occasions where you can save your progress.  The novelty factor is no longer than as there was with the original RE (which was not as novel as the truly original Alone in the Dark).	-1
I know what you'e thinkin'!!  I love Street Fighter 2, especially the Champion Edition because it super cool, fun, and has the outstanding graphics for its time, great selectable characters, and fluent controls.  Thats good and all for Super NES releases, but what was Sega thinking when releasing this game on the Genesis?  Read carefully because there are two major things I find wrong with the release on this console.  1. The buttons are limited.  I know that the Genesis has three main buttons other than start, but a standard fighting game has six buttons (HK, MK, LK, HP, MP, LP), not three!!  I don't know if this game is programmed for Genesis' new six button controller, but in order to use punch and kick buttons, you have to switch it up by pressing start, but that sucks the fun out of the game when you are trying to use a combination of moves to make it possible to defeat your opponent. 2. THERE'S NO PAUSE BUTTON!!!  In order to make a button to switch up from punches to kicks and vice versa, they made it for the start button!! Theres absolutely no excuse for a 16-bit game to not have a pause button! If you dare to play this game on the Genesis, make sure you have no interruptions: go to the bathroom before playing, make sure your parents don't need anything for two hours, and leave a message on your answering machine that says "I'm playing Street Fighter 2 on the Genesis that has no pause button, leave a message after the beep.  BEEP!"  What a rip off!  If you want to play the same classic game with the same graphics, but with more working control buttons and a pause button, get it for Super NES.	-1
Best game ever, but I wanted to long to test it and couldn't return it. My game didn't work.	-1
This game is horrible.  At the release of the movie I thought it would be fun to play the game series, then go see the flick.  I heard friends rave about this game, so I purchased it and couldn't get myself through the first ten minutes.  The camera angle is annoying, the controls clumsy, the gameplay corny.  The graphics left this veteran gamer with a sour taste.  However, if you like zombies and don't mind its serious flaws, give this one a try.  Maybe you'll feel better about it than I did.	-1
Do not even assume for a moment that Star Trek: Armada has any resemblance to Relic's Homeworld, the two are about as closely related as Woody Allen is to Arnold Schwarzengger. First off, it has the longest install process  of any game I have ever played, and I have a 48x CD-ROM drive. Second, the  interface is monstrous, even though it looks elegant and simple. While  positioning ships is easy, (and it should be since they only move in 2  dimensions), there is no real sense of scale, plus they have a tendency to  `bump' into objects like space stations and other ships. Secondly, the  instant they see an enemy ship, any vessel you control within weapons'  range automatically opens fire, taking interaction down a notch. Also  unlike Homeworld the user cannot assign formations to his ships, making  dispersement messy.  When the game starts the user is treated to a  rather nicely rendered opening scene with lots of fleet action between  Federation, Klingon, Romulan and Borg vessels that culminates on an all-out  run on Borg Cubes. (Though one wonders how Picard can face down Locutus  since they are the same guy. Did the Borg clone Picard?) Unfortunately, the  game doesn't deliver anywhere near the excitement generated by a 3 minute  opening segue. At the title screen you have a choice to play a series of  missions as either the Federation, Klingon, Romulan and Borg and they all  must be played before arriving at the finale mission. Overall, the game  seems to have been slapped together to capitalize on the franchise, lacking  both the quality and substance that LucasArts has put into their Star Wars  line of games. Armada lacks the epic scope of similar games like Homeworld  or even Starcraft. If you changed the space scapes to ground and the  starships to Zerg or Protoss units, Armada would be Starcraft, except not  as much fun.  Armada prolongs the Star Trek game curse when it should  have shattered it. The prospect of moving a fleet of Defiant and Sovereign  class starships around the screen should have been an easy game to create.  Perhaps if Activision had optioned the Homeworld engine for Armada, things  would have been different. However, on the upside, the rendered starships  do look nice, as does the 3D lighting for all of the effects shots. Getting  Patrick Stewart, Michael Dorn, and Denise Crosby to do voices will probably  get die-hard Trek fans to purchase the game to feed their pirana-like  frenzy for franchise merchandise, but style should never win out over  substance in a game like this. There is very little meat to this game.   Do yourself a favor, power up your warp engines and get away from this  title, as fast as you can.	-1
I have never heard of this game but am a big mario fan so i bougt it. unfortunately it did not work but the seller was glad to refund me the full price and i didn't have to return the game.	-1
Like i said i do not like RPGs and especially this one. I have it because of course its mario and im willing to try any mario. It takes so long to beat it because the RPG and it gets on ur nerves when u cant beat a boss or enemy and u have to restart and beat them. At the begining it has some cheesey video of what happend to peach. It took me forever to beat it and as soon as i did i felt much better and it did not seem as much as a dumb game. The graphics r ur ordinary snes graphics and the sound is not as good as most snes games. I don't like it because its an RPG but the only reason i keep it is because it adds to the collection and my little cousin loves to play it.	-1
This is one of the worst RPG's ever in existance. Besides being easy, it also has an unoriginal plot and crap graphics. I think the Atari 2600's system is more advanced than this game. I mean, what's an RPG without scantly clad women? This RPG has none, except for a princess who is as clothed as a fememist is. And Mallow and Geno are loaded with fail, and I don't see why people want them in Smash Brothers, which is a crap game as well. The plot tries to be all original by not centering on Bowser kidnapping and raping Peach, who is called Toadstool for whatever reason, but on some character named Smithy who is trying to take over the world by getting stars. Whatever. And the battle system is awful as well. I mean, timed hits?  For a good Mario game, play Mario is Missing!, Mario's Time Machine, or the CDI classic, Hotel Mario. If you want a good RPG, for the SNES, play Dungeon Master of Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.	-1
I really never understood the craze of this game. If you can get past ryu's ki blasts thdn he uppercuts you and starts shooting at you again. If you manage to make it to bison he stands on your head over and over until you die. Same with chun li. If you can get past sagats flying discs then he uppercuts you. If you try to attack guile he does his knee saber thing. Balrog gets you in a corner and stuns you with each hit and blocking still lowers your health, but attacking makes you get hit and die. The game at medium difficulty abuses the meta knowledge it has where if you punch and it punches, the favor is in the games timing and details so much that you are the one that gets hit. Plainly, the game is not fun due to a a computer tgat absurdly measures everything to its advantage to where every time you attack the game has measured and counter attacks flawlessly like a kid playing a master at chess. I hold my own in fighting games and am well versed in them, but the meta knowledge kills this game for me. # star because i honestly don't enjoy this game anymore. As a kid with nosalgia maybe, buy now as an adult, no.	-1
This and every other Street Fighter game ever made is overrated garbage. I can't believe how much people used to like this game. I've always hated Street Fighter. I think it was because I have always been a diehard Mortal Kombat fan,and since Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter have always been,and always will be rivals,I have,and will always,side with Mortal Kombat. MK had everything that this game did not. SF had dull cartoon-looking characters,while MK's characters were digitized and looked very realistic. SF was also more for kids,while MK blew everybody away with it's over-the-top violence and buckets of blood n gore. The gameplay was also so much better in MK as well,compared to SF II.Overall,If you want a REAL fighting game for your Genesis,get the Mortal Kombat games,and don't bother wasting your time and money on this or any other Street Fighter game for that matter.	-1
This game DOES NOT WORK!	-1
Do not buy from WE SELL NOW i bought this product from them that doesn't work i am highly upset.	-1
It's really sad on how they can combine two of Marvel's greatest super heroes and make a horrible game out of it and its no surprise that its been created by LJN.  I really wished that Nintendo could've licensed someone else to make this crossover because LJN is known for screwing up so many games for the NES, especially from famous movies and comic book heroes.  The cover of the game cartridge, title screen, and the fact that its Spider-Man and the X-Men (Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm, and Gambit) working together on one game misleaded every child into thinking how exciting the game would be, until they start the first level of the game.  The graphics weren't the worst, but the game looks like it belong to the NES or Sega Master System so there was no excuse on that department.  The gameplay totally sucks you know what.  Attacks are not very responsive and the game itself is unfairly difficult (remember that there are no continues in this game).  I love fun challenges, but this game went beyond impossible (this game is for kids so why is it so hard?).  I rented this game a few times back in 1993 and I was annoyed each time (I never finished the first level for each hero in Murder World level) so that is one of the video game memories I wish not to relive.  Like Spider-Man and The Sinister Six and NES version of The Uncanny X-Men, this is one Marvel Comic licensed game not worth playing and I can't believe that someone on Amazon is selling it for such a high price (no self respecting gamer would even buy this crap for a penny).  Please stay away from this horrible game.	-1
Early levels are easy but watch out when you do the hard ones - the AI is BRUTAL  If you want to play the original that started it all, this might be for you, but if you just wanted one of the Mario Kart series, look for the DS version or the one on Wii.	-1
I heard terrific things about Giants: Citizen Kabuto and was sadly disappointed when I finally purchased and played it for myself.  The most obvious annoyance was the lack of an in game save option.  I just don't have patience to play the same mission over and over.  And over.  If you believe patience is a virtue, you can develop it playing this game.  As for me, I couldn't even stand to finish it.	-1
I loved this game as a child but i now understand why the swag didn't last the shakiness of the screen an the blinking dark to light is just waiting for u to have a seisure. I like the game still but I have to take it easy.	-1
The status of this game is way over blown. I think i got this game maybe 7 years ago at a yard sale for 25 cents. And what a waste is was. I could have got a spent that quarter on a 25 cent burger on Mcdonalds has the 25 cent burger day. But no i bought Sonic the Boring Hedgehog. The levels are dull, The boss's repeat them selfs, Crummy music, And you die alot for no reason.........	-1
This game sure was great back in 1994, but for today time and age it's pretty outdated. The gameplay has a lot of frustrating jumps and don't satisfied me so much. Simply aged game.	-1
No matter how good you are at this game, nothing can prepare you for the lame cheap fest your in for.  I beat this game countless times but it never stops pissing me off that the enemies are so cheap, the game is so unfair and how they use the screen layout to their advantage.  Half the time no matter what you do you can't move because your getting gang raped and your sword magically goes through enemies running past you preparing for the gang rape, then your screwed.  I love games that are challenging, but not insanely hard just because of crippled controls and cheapness.  Fun for a little while, but the cheapness is too much.	-1
I had a friend who used to come over and make fun of me for owning Killer Instinct.  He'd constantly ask me "when are you going to get rid of this crappy game?" and I'd tell him "oh, eventually".  But it took until 2001 when the game didn't sell at a yard sale that I ended up throwing it in the trashbin . THAT is when I got rid of it for good.  The fighting in Killer Instinct is even worse than in Mortal Kombat, and I didn't think it was possible to defeat Mortal Kombat in sheer crappiness.  The one thing Killer Instinct does better than MK is the combo system.  It's easier and more enjoyable to unleash combos to your opponent in this game.  Unfortunately, just like Mortal Kombat, the fighting system is severely dated and useless by todays standards.  Unless you like your fighting games to be in slow-motion along with neverending choppy graphics (with bad-looking fatalities included for additional pain- pain that YOU feel) you should never ever think about buying this game.  Just another Super NES fighting game I hope people can't remember.	-1
ok first off NO dot-matrix gameboy title is ever worth $400.00 This outdated game was bad then, and worse now. Get your Metroid fix with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Metroid-Prime-Hunters/dp/B0009Z3MQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Metroid Prime Hunters</a>&nbsp;the instead... for about $20 bucks!	-1
This is my least favorite game in the franchise. (Pinball does not count.) The lack of a map and annoying Chozo Ruins music severely limit the enjoyment. HOWEVER, I do reccommend playing the 1st area of this game and then playing the AM2R demo. You will not believe the difference. I can't wait for AM2R. GOD BLESS MILTON GUASTI!!!!!!!!!!	-1
I have all three systems that this switch is suppose to run off of. My plan was to use this to free up the other three tv inputs from my television. The cover of the box looks like there are two input jacks but there's only one. What you see is the input into the television and the other goes into the NES/SNES/SEGA. I was hoping I could have two systems hooked up at once but I have to use the same jack for all 3 systems.  That's not even the problem with this RF switch. The connection to my TV is real grainy with wavy lines that run through the screen. It looks horrible. From the very start of gameplay it looked like I was playing on one of those old rabbit ear TVs from the 70s but this was on a flat screen. If you tested a Sega or SNES on this you would probably think there was something wrong with the system because of how bad the connection is.  First I tried the Sega Genesis. The wavy connection was instant so then I tried it with my NES to see if it was just the Sega. It wasn't. The connection was just as bad. I played for a while on my Genesis and just when I thought it couldn't get any worse the color went out in the middle of gameplay! Now not only was it a wavy connection with interference waves running across the screen, it was also in black & white. We played for a few more minutes and it looked like the color might have been coming back in but by then I was so frustrated I put in the regular Genesis hookup. The picture then looked clear and great on the newer TV.  I can honestly say that I probably won't use this product in the future. I wouldn't even recommend this as a back up because of it's poor quality and especially not as your main TV hookup. I have another 3 in 1 but it's an AC adapter and it's the same thing. These unlicensed after market remakes never seem work the way they should.	-1
This cable fit into my sega however it wouldn't connect to my TV. I have a newer HD-Flat screen TV and i wanted a coax connector to hook it up like the picture shows.....IT LIES! it uses an RF connector which didn't work with my TV. Also it came in a different box than the one shown. Shipped back and got a different one.	-1
this is promo game by 7 UP from back when they had a mascot called the cool spot this is a terrible game never play this in fact don't every buy this unless your collector and you just want it in your collection lots of enemies and its hard to hit a lot of them and its difficult like most games back in the day when had only 3 lives to be a game and sometimes continues if you were lucky this is very terrible game it has good graphics for its time though and was a interesting mascot character game more interesting then that it has no ESRB rating because it got released before the ESRB existed	-1
computer version alot better	-1
A JUMPS AND B ATTACKS? THAT MIGHT WORK ON THE NES, BUT NOT ON THE SNES. ON THE SNES IN MOST PLATFORMERS, B JUMPS AND Y ATTACKS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS STANDARD PRETTY MUCH DESTROYED THIS GAME. THERE'S NOT EVEN A CONFIGURATION MODE TO FIX THE CONTROL PROBLEM. ALSO, GRAPHICS ARE UNIMPROVED OVER THE NES! WHY!? The game's not all bad though. Passwords allow you to continue from the level you left off on, which is a major convenience. Because of that alone getting this is better than getting the NES titles separately.	-1
Remember the moment in the movie Jurassic park when Dr. Grant raced across the plains of the jungle on the back of a galimums while shooting his machine gun at attacking helicopters? How about when he trecked through ancient aztec ruins while shooting flame thrower equiped janitors? And don't forget the time he ran around on a cargo ship while blowing up floors and engines with his arsenal of grenades.  What? You don't recall those action packed moments? Neither do I, but that's what's presented in the sega genesis game "Jurassic park: Rampage edition."  Jurassic park rampage edition (JPRE) takes an alternate, more action paced look at the classic story of dinosaurs gone amok on a jungle island. Where in the books and the movies Grant was a quiet paleontologist who just wanted to dig up ancient bones in the desert, here he's become a super military commando who makes Rambo look like Ronald McDonald. Where in the movie and books Grant was focused on getting off the island without becoming dinosaur food, here he's shooting everyone and everything in sight...which isn't necessarily a bad thing, due to the fact that everyone and everything on the island is out to kill him.  It should be said up front right now. JPRE is the most unintentionally silliest games i've ever played. All the little factors add up to create an experience that is so silly and so dorky in all it's aspects that one can't help but chuckle when you look back on the experience.  Where to begin? Well, let's start with the other humans. For some reason, Jurassic park is populated with thousands of soliders and janitors, both who are equipped with military weapons and are, for some reason, out to kill you. No matter where you go, you'll find dozens of soldiers and janitors shooting at you and chucking grenades in your direction (Luckily, Grant can survive multiple grenade hits, so it's not too much of a problem). It's a mystery why these guys are out to kill you when there's no logical reason to it. Furthermore, they seemed to have made an alliance with the local dinosaurs because they never attack them, and the dinosaurs never attack them as well. It seems that poor Grant is under the crosshairs of every single living thing on the island.  Every stage you go through in the game (with the exception of Grant's final level) is packed to the brim with a riddiculous number of soldiers, janitors, raptors, compys, spitters, and even a triceratops or two. How do you deal with these threats? Here's a hint. You run. You run your stubbly little legs as fast as you can. While the whole point of JPRE is to be an action packed game where you shoot every living thing in sight, it's simply much more efficent to just run and jump your way to the exit (with this method, you can finish the game in about twenty minutes).  If you want, you can go through the game and try to kill everything with your enormous arsenal of weapons (more on those later), it's simply not really worth the effort. For one thing, you'll probably get hit a lot trying to inflict damage on your enemies. Trying to kill raptors is a pain in the butt due to faulty hit detection. A raptor (or two) will jump next to you and start bitting and whacking away with thier tails as you frantically fire your shotgun over and over again trying to hit them, yet they take no damage. So you leap away and start firing, and finally kill them after several shots. As a result of not being able to hit them at point blank range, you've lost 3/4th of your health and a lot of ammo has been wasted. When attacking kamikazie soldiers and janitors, it's very common to have several grenades chucked in your direction before you even get a shot off. Result? Loose health before you even take out one guy.  And let's not even talk about the wackiest enemy in the game. Attack helicopters! Yes, that's right. When going through the savanna level, Grant is constantly being assaulted by attack helicopters that fire rockets at him! When I saw one coming onto the scren for the first time, I had to pause the game because I was laughing too much to keep going. Here I was, just trying to get across that blasted savanna, being attacked by grenade chucking soldiers and machine gun equipped janitors, and here i'm being attacked by an attack helicopter?! What kind of psycho island is this?! Thankfully, these helicopters can be driven away by shooting...of all things...tranquilizer darts into them. Whee!  Fortunitly, to counter the threat of attack helicopters and flame-thrower equipped janitors, you have an enormous arsenal of military grade weapons at your disposal.  No longer satisfied with gas grenades and puny tranquilizer pistols (from the original Jurassic park game on the Sega genesis), Grant has an arsenal of death dealing weaponry, ranging from shotguns to machine guns, to rockets and death dealing grenades.  All of these get the job done, but the greatest satisfaction comes from using the greatest weapon in the history of video games:  The electric gun (or as I call it, the zappy gun).  This amazingly fun weapon doesn't just kill bad guys, it disintigrates them!  Simply fire the gun, watch the bolt of electricity go out, and when it hits the janitor, he'll go "Ogh!", briefly turn into a skeleton, and vanish into thin air.  It sounds brutal, but it's absoloutly hilarious to watch! (and let's face it, disintigrating an incredibly annoying enemey is tremendously satisfying!).  As an added bonus, it also does the disentigration effect on dinosaurs as well!  If one wants to have lots of gunning and running action while shooting dinosaurs, then you'll certianlly get it while playing this game.  Going through each level pits you against literally hundreds of soliders and dinosaurs, so much so that at times it's easy to get overwhelmed.  Fortunitly, the game does include a desperatly needed checkpoint system (which was missing in the first genesis game).  This is the kind of game that you can play two ways.  You can run and try to survive to get to the end, or you can take your time and kill everything you come across, so you do get a bit of freedom when it comes to how you play.  But even with all the guns, the sillyness of the game, and even the checkpoints...JPRE just isn't much fun to play.  As I said earlier, it's fairly easy to be overwhelmed by enemies in some levels, but the game eventually just boils down to "run and shoot" or just "run".  There are items you collect for points, but those points don't do anything.  At it's core, JPRE is a simple, run around and shoot em up shooter.  It has good graphics, some nice music (I do like the jazz/rock theme), but whether you like it or not is really up to personal taste.  If you like mindless action games with guns...lots of guns...then you might like this.  With many emulators on the internet, why not try downloading it and giving it a try?  You just might find yourself getting a laugh or two messing around with those crazy janitors.	-1
Back in 1993 Sega released a dull, lackluster video game of one of the biggest films of all time. Quickly realizing their mistake they hashed out a different version of the game, claiming it would be bigger, tougher and better. It isn't. It's a slow, boring game. You can choose to be either Dr. Alan Grant or...a Raptor. Both have their problems. Why would Dr. Grant go around killing all those army guys (just what are they doing in the game)? And why a Raptor be killing other Raptors? Weird. Obviously not learning from their first mistake Sega really dropped the ball on this so-called Rampage Edition. One of the slowest, sluggish and dullest platformers I have ever played.	-1
Wow. There isn't much to say about this game other than simply "Wow". Sarcastically mind you.  Let me take you back to video game arcades in the 1980's. Namco developed a little game called "Pac-Man" that featured a 6/8 yellow circle that had an insatiable appetite for dots that may or may not have a specific flavor. Unfortunately there were four ghosts who weren't too happy about this Pac-Man eating all these dots so they would try their hardest to stop Pac-Man at all costs. However some of those dots, seemingly grown using some type of growth enhancer, endowed Pac-Man with an unusual power to totally eat the ghosts! Every now and then, someone would throw some fruit or a random food onto the play field for Pac-Man to devour, providing him with the ability to expand his palette a little.  This is the game that became a world-wide phenomenon. This is the game that created a character that is universally recognized as an icon representing all that is great about the hey-day of classic gaming! This great sprite known as Pac-Man leads the pack in the annals of classic gaming, showing one and all where our Xbox 360 and PS3 came from.  Knowing that, Namco still had the audacity to lower Pac-Man to this sorry state? To portray Pac-Man not as an iconic leader of the classic gaming era, but rather as some overly emotional twit at the mercy of your slingshot?  The entire object of the game is to eventually beat down some creature made entirely out of gum. That's fine and all, but the game engine doesn't support the appropriate controls for combat of this nature let alone the simple and obvious fact that the missions really don't relate enough to put two and two together to get to a climatic battle with the gum monster. The missions just seem totally random in purpose; and this doesn't account for the fact that simply completing the main game missions only adds up to just under 50% of the entire completion rating for the game. Seeing as how annoying this game is, I can't see any reason to try to complete 100% of the game.  The gameplay is somewhat autonomous in the sense that the game basically does whatever it wants until you sling a rock anywhere on the screen. Pac-Man moves in a direction continually until either something attacks him or you hit him with either a rock or a Super Pac-Ball or he just decides he doesn't like you anymore. The engine is based on Pac-Man's emotions. If you keep Pac-Man happy, he'll do whatever it is you want him to do and this is usually the only way to ensure that you complete any of the game's missions because if you make Pac-Man angry, he'll ignore your commands and ignore objects in the environment that you'll need to have to complete missions.  The only real way to interact with Pac-Man to make sure he does what you want him to do is to shoot at stuff in the environment. You can make him eat foods like apples and hot dogs, you'll have to shoot at things to get them to drop from trees or to keep things from hitting Pac-Man, you'll need to shoot doors of stores (surprisingly the glass on the doors doesn't break) to make Pac-Man go in, and what's more, you'll have to shoot Super Pac-Balls at him to make him turn into Super Pac-Man so that he'll attack the ghosts when they appear.  Speaking of that, another annoying aspect of the game is the ghost encounters. Essentially you'll need to fight the ghosts off so that Pac-Man will stop sniveling like a little wimp. You can't shoot at them with your normal rocks, you'll have to shoot a Super Pac-Ball at Pac-Man to turn him into Super Pac-Man. Once this happens, again, you have absolutely no control over Pac-Man. The game just makes him fly back and forth across the current screen until the time runs out and he attacks anything that resembles a ghost. This lack of control just becomes down-right annoying. It's basically a "Day in the Life of Pac-Man Simulator".  Sometimes I get bored with trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do and just shoot at Pac-Man until he gets really mad and gets attacked by a cat near the hot dog stand. That's more fun then actually trying to finish the game, which if you did you wasted your time like I did.  Then there are these stages where you have to guide Pac-Man while he's flying a hang glider or riding in a mine cart. Now these aren't that bad because there aren't too many of them but there's one mine cart ride in particular that really just blew me away with its difficulty. The game goes from being totally cryptic to virtually unbeatable in under twenty seconds and the worst part is you have no choice but to continue through the mine shaft. It took me, quite literally, two hours to get though this shaft and the reward at the end wasn't even hardly the beginning of anything satisfying because it lead to the backyard of Pac-Man's house.  I really don't know what Namco was thinking with this game and honestly I don't want to know. While they did present some very original ideas to gameplay, what they got was something far from satisfying, not to mention they defamed Pac-Man's reputation. This game is no where even close to a start of becoming anything like the game that made Pac-Man famous. The game is definitely not worth the buy and should be avoided at all costs unless you're missing a piece in your SNES collection.	-1
it came in the mail all beat up and didn't work ! a waste of money !	-1
I was given this game by a friend who didn't want it anymore.  Now I see why he was so quick to just give it away.  This game is the worst of all RPG's.  Weak story, repetitive gameplay, bad music, and graphics that make me wonder whether this is a Playstation game or a GameBoy Color game.  Stay away from this at all costs.  You'll see it selling for about $2.99 at some ebgames stores.  The price is that low for a reason.	-1
Lots and LOTS of random battles, dumb characters, dumb gameplay, graphics that would look bad on the SNES (except for the constant battles). I played this when there were no other RPGs on the Playstation and I had the flu. With so many great RPGs out now, there is no reason for this game. Actually, there was no reason for it in the first place. I'm an RPG nut, but this one is just plain bad.	-1
Well, I guess the title for this review should essentially sum up the game. This game featured some of the greatest names in pro wrestling in the late 80's and early 90's. Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Hawk and Animal The Legion of Doom, Earthquake and Typhoon the Natural Disasters, The Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase and Sid Justice make up quite an impressive roster for a wrestling game made during that era. I will concede that Bret "The Hitaman" Hart not being in the game is kind of a snub, but it does not matter since the game is lousy.  There is the typical one-on-one match-up as well as Tag Team match-up, and even a Survivor Series elimination match. But the biggest flaw is the fact that there are no finishers. You won't see Hogan's leg drop, Savage's flying elbow, Earthquake's butt-splash or the Doomsday Device. It is just a simple finger-blistering grapple war, and no tournament or campaign mode means that there is no real reason to play more than a single match of the game, nor is there any point to selecting a character.  The sound is the typical recycled grunts and slams on the mat. While the music is halfway decent, that's about the only redeeming factor. These flaws would be fixed in the sophomoric attempt Royal Rumble. This title, however, was best avoided then back in the day, and now as well.	-1
LJN was a subsidiary of Acclaim Entertainment created to make more games for the NES and it continued into the SNES/Genesis era. One of their first games they released for the SNES was WWF Super Wrestlemania in 1992. While it was great to see a game with the WWF license, it only turned out to be a forgettable wrestling game that sorely lacked content and variety.  WWF Super Wrestlemania lets you take control of one out of eight wrestlers. From there, you can choose to play a one player game to go against the computer, a 2 player vs. game to go against another player or a tag team mode where you and another player take on a computer controlled tag team. Whoever pins the other person first is the winner of the match. That's pretty much the entire game. There is nothing else to do but to tweak the options before or after the match.  The PROS: For its time, the graphics and sounds were top notch. The controls were simple enough so it doesn't take long before you pull off punches, kicks, body slams and jumping off from the top rope. The wrestlers look good enough that you recognize them. Finally, 2 player support means you can take on a friend anytime you wanted when you get tired of playing against the computer.  The CONS: The problems here are few but bothersome. First off, you only have 8 wrestlers and that is a small selection to choose from. Second, the game modes are scarce: there aren't any main story or tournament modes to play through. One player, 2 player vs. and tag team modes are no different from each other. Even though they look like the real wrestlers, the in-game wrestlers don't have any of their trademark moves. They all move the same and have the same basic moves so it didn't matter which wrestler you play with. Then there is the ring you fight in. There's only one ring you fight in. The crowd cheers for you in the background but it loops constantly so it will eventually get on your nerves. At this point, the game starts to get very repetitive with no real purpose other than to fight over and over again. Clearly, LJN just wanted this game out there since there were new gaming consoles that people were buying at the time.  It was fun playing this game for a while but afterwards, it got boring. The lack of game modes, variety in the rings and the absence of trademark moves for the wrestlers just makes WWF Super Wrestlemania feel like a generic wrestling game without any of the things that mirrored the World Wrestling Federation at the time. If you're looking for a good SNES wrestling game, get Royal Rumble instead.	-1
This game is terrible!!! I wish I could rate it with negative stars. This is a disgrace to wrestling, sports entertainment, and anything associated with it. As big of a joke as wrestling is, this is still bad.  There are very few moves, very robotic movement. No finishing moves, lack of modes as well. Single player, YAY! Punch and kick 1 guy until one of you has had enough then get pinned. Tag team mode, the exact same, but with 2 guys on each side and Survivor Series mode, the exact same with 4 guys. That's it, that's all there is. No career mode for a belt, no battle royal, nothing. RAW was much better for the snes. Get that instead	-1
Trust me, the Super NES version of Super Wrestlemania is awful in every sense of the word.  The way the wrestlers *very* slowly walk across the screen JUST to deliver a simple generic wrestling move to your opponent (because the game company didn't give any of the wrestlers many moves to work with) is worse than any kind of pain you can imagine.  I can't believe anyone would consider buying this game, unless they had personal childhood memories attached to it and they were buying it BACK after giving it away or something.  The one thing it has going for it is the selection of legendary wrestlers.  Once you select one of those wrestlers and actually play the game, you're in for a nasty snail-pace surprise.  So bad, so boring, so forgettable.	-1
THE GAME IS SLOW AND THERE IS NO WRESTLING MOVES.BUT YOU GET OUTSIDE THE RING ACTION WITH ANY WRESTLER.PS IF YOU WANT WRESTLING GET WWF RAW OR THE ROYAL RUMBLE FOR SNES.	-1
The original Wrestlemania was in no way at all a good game. It was boring, slow and every wrestler had the same exact moves and more or less looked the same. Wrestlemania wasn't meant to be a stand out game. I think it was meant to be the beginning of something else because after this came WWF Royal Rumble and WWF Raw which some of us plated to death. I would surpass this one and go straight to either WWF Royal Rumble or WWF RAW.	-1
Super Wrestlemania was pretty good back in 1991, but later SNES WWF games were much better and made this one look second-rate. The graphics were decent, the sound was okay (future WWF SNES games improved on both graphics and sound...Royal Rumble and Raw had very good music for a SNES game, and Raw actually had a decent intro [similar to the WWF Monday Night Raw's 1993-1994 opening for the TV show]), but where it really lacks is it features just a few modes of play : singles match (player vs computer or player vs player) and tag team match (one player vs computer, one player vs another player, and two players together vs computer)...you won't find any tournament modes in this one, so you won't be able to go for the World Wrestling Federation Championship (the REAL world heavyweight title, slappy!). Future SNES WWF games allow you to go for the gold (WWF World title in Royal Rumble, and both WWF World title and WWF Tag title in WWF Raw). You'd be better off with either Royal Rumble or Raw.	-1
Okay, the game isn't horribly bad.  It ran fine on my computer.  No problems with instal or starting or anything like that.  Default controls are weird but changeable.  My major drawback to this game was what was the point?  The graphic novel would have been interesteting if it was something you get at the comic shop.  I feel cheated by lack of movies.  The novel could have been made into movies and lasted a little longer.  It was short.  The weapons were cool but the bullet-time, should just have stayed in the Matrix.  The graphics were great but for a first-person shooter the game was not all that good.  When its in the [price] bin, get it.  But other than that save your money.	-1
This has to be the worst version if Tecmo Bowl.  Get one of the others.	-1
This is a Mortal Kombat clone, with huge amounts of blood, and two fatalities for each competitor. The only difference with this game is that all of the fighters are pre-historic! Two apes, a big dinosaur, a fire breathing legendary dinosaur, a raptor and much more. The gameplay is much like Street Fighter 2, and the gameplay is very slow, because you are fighting as dinosaurs! Another interesting feature is that for those who like to use the same move over and over again, the game laughs at you. Pretty cheap game, rent it before you buy it.	-1
(...) Primal rage is a game about seven dino-gods who are set free from their prisons when a disaster strikes "Urth" in the near future. The player's goal is to defeat the other dino-gods, conquer their lands, gain the most number of worshippers and end up ruling the new urth. The concept sounds okay, but the game which follows the story is not really. When you turn on the game and arrive at the title screen, you may think the background bird sounds are cool. But go to the player select screen and from there it's all downhill. The sound and music quality is more like that of a Sega Genesis game. Then there are weird scratching noises at times, and a horrible "continue screen" music that will make you drop the controller and run for an asprin! The graphics are slightly easier to handle. The seven monsters are reasonable, especially the t-rex duo Sauron and Diablo. Sometimes however you may find yourself trying to identify which is the head and tail in the middle of the action. The backgroung visuals are also decent. But the fatalities...are terrible. They are nowhere near the quality of Mortal Kombat. It's hard to actually figure out what they are doing in some. Then there are the special moves. Some of them are okay (like Diablo's "hot foot"), and some of them are not (like Chaos's "farts" and "puke"). Talk about weirdness. The character Vertigo is ridiculous. A dinosaur with the head of a cobra and the tail of a scorpion? Some special moves are hard to identify as what they're supposed to be. The controls aren't quite what you'd want. The characters are poor at jumping, and even slow and clumsy on ground. It's sometimes hard to identify if the move they are performing is a special move or just a normal one. Oh, I said something of the sort above, didn't I? So if you want a Genesis quality game for your SNES (you're nuts), then you can buy this. But what's the point? The SNES has much more eye-candy and easier to control fighting games out there. This is one of the least appealing SNES fighting games I've played. If you want some mindless button-mashing with no real depth and unrealistic amounts of gore, this game is for you. Incase you don't realise the difference in quality right away, play this first and then play Street Fighter II Turbo, Mortal Kombat or even TMNT: Tournament Fighters. You soon will.	-1
Max Payne has been in development for approximately 4 years, and it took all that time to publish a [...] game that doesn't include a multiplayer mode, very, very few cut scenes, and one boring character who has the constant look of constipation or a reaction to "stinky feet" on his face 100% of the time, it's really very annoying. The whole game revolves around "Bullet time," a nifty idea that is great when it's simply another feature in a game, but to have the entire game built around it is simply boring. Max Payne consists of running into a dark room, shooting everybody, then moving on to the next room, wash, rinse and repeat, over and over and over. On top of that you get to read incredibly corny, "John Woo" style (whatever that is) dialogue (read: bad cliches) and cinematic flair. The story revolves around you finding your wife and child shot by someone and you go out for revenge as a renegade cop of sorts and uncover a large conspiracy.  The characters are completely uninteresting, look much too similar, and the comic book style text which breaks things up are as boring and dull as an episode of NYPD Blue. Max Payne should've (been cheaper) for the game itself is only about 10 or so hours long, has little to-no extras, and limited replayability. Shooting people in slow motion simply isn't enough to knock my socks off I guess.	-1
There should be a very easy setting. The game is much too difficult for me which makes it unplayable.	-1
I really did not think i would like this game. But, it is both challenging and fun. This is unlike any other game i have ever played. Worth buying most definetly.	-1
Dead save battery	-1
This might be a great game, but I may never know.  In spite of having a P3 with 640MB of RAM and a 64MB Graphics card, this game has crashed (frozen) my Windows ME system three times in a row, as I've tried to "play" the tutorial.  I've been trying to download a patch all day, and the miserable connection speed eventually degrades to nothing, and then restarts (thankfully where it left off).  If it ever downloads and installs, perhaps it will resolve my freezes, but not so far.	-1
I just finished MP, and it only took me a day and a half. Judging from other comments on Amazon I'm not the only person to have finished the game in such a short time. The graphics are a real mix. The cool particle engine shines as a stunning example of what we can look forward to in the next generation of game engines, but the scenery and background art looks brown and dull throughout the entire game - think Quake2 without the aliens and you're not far off. The game's one "gimmick" of a slo-motion play mode is fun for the first couple of hours, then just gets boring. I wish they had spent more time on producing a story (it has every cheesy cliche in the book, and is presented by a dull expressionless monotone narration). The game was so gripping that I just had to go and fill in my yearly tax return instead. Don't buy the hype.. buy a decent game instead.	-1
Really lame and should be avoided. I do not know why Sega is intent to release all this [junk] for the Saturn, but it is not getting them anywhere.	-1
One main gimmick (the bullet-time feature) and some decent graphics. That's all this overrated game really offers. And not only is it a 1.5 trick pony, but it's a very short one, too...you can finish it the same day you receive it. Suffice it to say Max Payne is just poor value all round. It's obvious most of the reviewers here either don't have the game or reviewed it while still in their 10-hour honeymoon with it. It's incredible how much a couple of days can sober one's opinion of this lackluster game. My two cents? Save your money and don't bother till it hits the bargain bin.	-1
if you pay over 200.00 for the first dragoon game you need to understand its only 6 levels so don't spend that much when you can get it for 25.00 everywhere else	-1
Oh! come on this game isn't that easy. It is so hard. This game has too many confusing puzzels. If you looking for something Really fun try something a little easier.	-1
PATHETIC HEALTH NO IDEA WHAT TO DO IF ONE DIES. BOTH DIE STUPID PASSWORDS NO SAVES ENEMY AI IS OP WATCH AVGN	-1
If you don't have an instructions manual for this game, good luck finding out what your objective is.  The difficulty of this game is surreal, I constantly see myself getting bombarded by projectiles, random skateboards, and other enemies in the game. Though I do like how I can travel through actual B&BH areas, actually finding out what you're suppose to do is a task.  I will say I was extremely impressed with the games graphics scheme, its probably the only reason this game is getting a two from me.	-1
Crappy a total waste of my money	-1
doesn't work with the game system that i bought	-1
The game didn't work unfortunately. Shame too, It was one of my favorite games on the SNES.	-1
My sister got this game when she was a kid, she never made it past the second level. I gave a crack at it and made it a little further. This game has a Very high difficulty after the first level. The Music and graphics however are quite good. I only suggest this game to hardened gamers that are lion king fans.	-1
I don't get the appeal of the Wipeout games. They're terrible. Wipeout 3 and XL are no different. The music is good enough (for a bunch of techno beats... yeah, I'm not a techno fan) and the graphics are slick and futuristic-looking, but the actual racing part has one BIG problem: you keep hitting the side of the track as you go around a turn and for some reason that means you have to make a complete stop. It wouldn't be so bad if you just slowed down, but the fact that your vehicle stops *immediately* is the worst thing ever.  How are you supposed to enjoy a racing game if you keep hitting the side of the track and STOPPING every couple seconds? There's so many turns in any one of the races, that the problem is unavoidable. I don't understand when people say you need skill to enjoy these racing games. If I can't increase speed, then what ELSE is there to enjoy? If the appeal lies in playing each race over and over so you can memorize the track to avoid hitting the side, then count me out. Doing that would be WAY too tedious of a task. You need a lot of space to freely drive around or else a racing game won't work.  Sure, I can go around shooting other vehicles, but who cares about that when I can't ever catch up to them. Too many sharp turns in the Wipeout series make it difficult to build up speed. Right when I think I've got a good race going, I hit the side and my car stops and there goes the momentum. What a way to kill the fun.  Buy if you want a slap of crap.	-1
This game is to dark to see anything and hard to play with the controls provided.  I'd recommend upgrading to a different system for this game.	-1
Not as described. Was supposed to be complete in box but came as lose cart. Amazon helped me out tho.	-1
WOW this game was hard.  I hate to see the kids back in 1995 '96 try to beat this game. it took me 2 hrs to beat a world.  I almost smashed the game pak, theres that little room for error in this game	-1
I am just as aware as anyone that people do not base their opinions of popular videogames on intelligent scripting, intelligent plot, intelligent substance, and intelligent thinking, so no one has to remind me.  If they did, this "Colony Wars" never would've left a single draft.  First of all, I too respect the abilities of developers of Psygnosis as much as anybody, and I would like to describe that respect, but I feel I have to say my piece about this game and come to my point.  There isn't a single idea in this game that isn't founded on generic thinking, the thievery of other games, and on movie cliche's.  There isn't one single idea based in science fiction, unlike its other competitor, "Darklight Conflict," the true hero here, a little-known and original game released by Electronic Arts (EA) before "Colony Wars" was conceived.  "Darklight Conflict" was a space-shooter, and the gameplay idea for "Colony Wars" merely replicated that game.  Here's the story of "Colony Wars": "You are a militant fighter pilot in space on the side of the rebel alliance who is trying to force the evil Emporer to his senses by shooting up his armies," or so says the narrational voice of an actor that sounds exactly just like James Earl Jones (the voice of Darth Vader) during the full-motion videos (FMVs) which were made by the same company who did special effects for "Independence Day."  Sounds like a direct, word-for-word copy of the plot of "Star Wars."  Here're the ideas of "Colony Wars": Large firey explosions even if they don't really exist in space because fire needs oxygen to exist and space has no atmosphere.  Black holes even if they don't exist as large red whirlpools in the middle of space backgrounds because their gravity is so intense, light cannot escape.  Spaceships even though they don't have wings like planes because there is no atmospheric friction to enable control using aero parts.  Also, they don't make loud rumbling noises when they pass by the camera lense because sound needs atmosphere.  Here, you get a future of imperialistic humans warring over the colonization and liquidation of the rest of the planetary systems in the universe for purposes of natural resources.  The mission and battle drill instruction voice is male, but it is okay for a female to narrate if limited to talking about other subjects like the options menus.  "Space cowboys" does not make science fiction, only unoriginal action games captivating non-thinkers.  Here's the story of EA's "Darklight Conflict":  You are a Top Gun pilot in the middle of a dogfight when suddenly a beam of light surrounds you.  When you awake, you are in a completely foreign environment.  You realize your arms and legs have been replaced with some kind of tentacles that are biologically grafted to what appears as the console of a space vehicle.  A voice speaks in English to you, but it is not the voice of any human.  You have been inducted into the army of an alien race in the midst of interplanetary war to help defend their losing side, which is why they recruited you with your expert fighter pilot experience.  Their vessels are signified by a symbol, a four-fingered hand.  At first, you will begin with training.  The small fighterships are oval, with fins protruding from what could be their sides.  The weaponry is a variety involving weird plasma cannons.  Your ship uses an electromagnetic field to shield itself, but it consumes a great deal of energy.  You venture through the wormhole warps, and should carefully avoid the radiation waves that usurp your vessel energy during the travel.  Even the name "Darklight Conflict" is science fiction.  I could connect some of the premise of the game with the old sci-fi film "This Island Earth", but not much of its premise.  In that movie, a group of scientists are helping an alien race that appear about human, so the scientists don't find out they're aliens immediately.  When they do, the aliens take them to their planet and the alien commander tells them their planet is being overrun by another planet's race, and they recruited Earth's best scientists to come up with new and advanced technology to help them survive the invasion.  Their enemies soon destroy the planet, but the ship has enough energy to return the scientists to Earth.  After their safe return, the aliens drive their ship into the sea, never to be heard from again.  But, who remembers stuff like that?	-1
I keep trying to force myself to play this thing because all  I read are rave reviews for it...but I'm not feeling it.  First off half of the sound effects are downright ANNOYING (that crying baby Mario makes me reach for the power button every time...couldn't they have thought of something else???).  Then there are the controls, which I find much less intuitive than other Mario games--even the way Yoshi jumps is off...it's way too slow.  Even if I look past those issues, I still don't find myself having fun while playing this game.  Where's the fun??	-1
game not worth the money i beat the game within 40 minutes!!!! as a 6 year old i loved playing this game but it was literaly a piece of cake now being older wouldnt of bought it for 5 bucks	-1
Many magazines have been giving this item rave reviews, but I can't understand why.  Sure the design is elegant and innovative, but it makes  games almost impossible to play unless you are in absolute darkness.  The  glare from this light is just plain ridiculous, and the only way to  decrease it is to bend the light to one side, which decreases the amount of  light on the screen.  There has GOT to be a better way to light up your  gameboy, and let me tell you, this is NOT it.	-1
I bought my kids each one of these at Christmas, so that they could play with their Gameboys in the car when the light was low. Waste of time and money. The light isn't very powerful, doesn't illuminate much of the  screen, and seems to suck the batteries dry much sooner. The glare makes my  eyes  hurt, and I can't imagine it's good for my kids either. We don't use  them any more. Don't bother.	-1
Yes,it may look neat and attractive,but trust me,it is not worth it! The glare from the light covers the entire screen ofmy GBC and makes game play impossible. And,if you try to cooperate with it,it just gives you a big headache. I guess playing in the dark is just not a good idea for now,	-1
You first selects as one of three pit fighters to compete against a slew of amazing brutal pit fighters (a whole 7). This is your normal fighting game, no blood, no fatalities, the only difference is that there is more of a playing field, you can move around the total pit, rather than just moving left and right on a platform like other fighting games. There are pretty simple moves, punches, kicks, sweeps, yada yada, which make the game get old really quick. The only good thing about the game is its huge challenge and special rounds, such as when you must fight tigers! Rent it, don't buy it.	-1
I applaud the creators for their effort, which we all know was immense. I'm sure they put an insane amount of time and effort into this game, and they did manage to create some immersion. However, I did not care for the puzzles, and didn't feel inspired to go on. Video games work on a simple "reward" system. The level of difficulty should yield an equal reward. Otherwise, what's the point? Well I found with Myst that I was forced to accomplish and re-accomplish extremely large and time consuming tasks with little to no reward.   In one "age", if u choose a wrong switch you have to go somewhere else and re-charge a battery, and to re-charge the battery you have to pump water and this whole time you're running back and fourth and back and fourth. I LOVE complex puzzles, but what I HATE is when they are spaced far apart and you have to keep running from A to B over and over, performing trial and error. I wasn't really motivated by the story, if there was one, and the bit of acting in the game was silly. The ages were completely devoid of humanity, making the "journey" depressing. Oh did I mention "secret hotspots"? Yeah if you can't figure out what to do next it's because you haven't found the secret hotspot. Also the navigation is so confusing that you completely miss pathways. This is because when the curser says right or left, it sometimes actually means it's going to turn you 180 degrees. That's fine but when all the scenery looks similar, you don't know you you just turned to the right, or 180 degrees. It's a nightmare. One reviewer said their 10yr old son liked the game. Yeah right. He just thought it was fun to play on the computer. Trust me, he wasn't actually playing the game. Most intelligent adults that i've asked about this game felt that it nearly drove them mad and they got pretty angry at the game. Not because they were not smart enough, but because the game really tests your patience and most of all- doesn't give you adequate rewards for your efforts. Sometimes when you step in an elevator the door automatically closes. Then, another time, you learn that you have to close the door yourself. I don't feel like I'm playing a game, I feel like I'm just learning how the game creators try to stump us. I will not be playing Riven, or anything else by these people. Which is truly sad because the graphics in Riven look amazing. If they spent less time on complexity and size, and put more work in the story, and the drive, it could have been worth my while. I had more fun playing Aura, even with the nausea-inducing 3D nagivation. Syberia remains the champion.	-1
Take everything wrong with Mega Man 1 and 2 on the NES and you get this. Your fired shots travel WAY TOO SLOW on the Game Boy, and these stages, especially the Fortress and Space Station at the end of the game, are NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE! Plus if you lose in either you have to start over, and that means if you die at the end of the Fortress, at the hands of a Robot Leader, you have to fight the whole way back to them, and any you beat must be beaten again. ROBOT LEADERS WAVE ONE: Elec Man, Cut Man, Fire Man, Ice Man FORTRESS ROBOT LEADERS: Bubble Man, Flash Man, Heat Man, Quick Man, and ? This ain't no masterpiece and is for Mega Man die-hards only.	-1
I sometimes wonder how people would react to this game if it did not have the Final Fantasy franchise name attached to it.  I can recommend two better tactical srpg games before you make this purchase:  Vandal Hearts for psx and Shining Force 2 for the Genesis or Wii Virtual Console(I would go the latter since genesis and snes games have issues with the save battery due to age) or if endless grinding is your thing then Disgea series is another good recommendation.  Not that this game is bad but I wanted the one star rating to get everyone's attention and let them know they have better options when its comes to srpgs.	-1
After the disappointment of FF XII, was curious what makes that producer so well known and could mess up a frachise like this. So went back to the roots and try Final Fantasy Tactics. I think there are really some people who enjoy frustrations in games and think that this is the only way to consider a game fun. Final Fantasy Tactics is annoying, frustrating and unrewarding. I don't know what's wrong with people who think that this is a great game. You think you can spend time to level up the characters to make the story battles easier? You are completely wrong. I'm stuck in a boss battle that after a 100 hours of level up you thought you have characters 30 levels higher than the enemies, you should be ok? You are wrong. The boss is so strong that despite you are 30 levels higher than them, it can wipe out your whole party in one go - despite all of them are 30 levels higher and have the best equipment on them at that point of the game. What's the point? I think I'll give up the Final Fantasy frachise for good now if the next game is by the same producer. It's not worth it at all. For people who think this kind of game challenging and fun, I think I'd rather not be a gamer anymore. If I can, I want to give -5 stars to this game.	-1
I never did get to far playing this game. I just don't get the hang of it. So I quit this game soon after I started. I like a game I can get somewhere with. I guess I didn't understand what it was all about when I bought it. Somebody else might do alright with it, but not me.	-1
To get the bad out of the way, this game is slow, tedious, and "tactics" simply is not a good way to describe it. There is very little tactical combat involved. Moves happen immediately as soon as you choose an action. There are no attacks that change the position of enemies, so a very large amount of the game is luck regarding the position of your enemies to allow you to cast wide-range spells that will annihilate everything. Adding to the bad is the downright broken leveling system. Essentially it works like this: Perform an action, get experience and job points. Regardless of what action you perform. This ends up making you enter a random battle, killing all except one enemy, and throwing rocks at each other for an hour until you all have leveled up obscenely, and can essentially learn any skill now. Not very fun. The story is also pretty pathetic, the translation makes the game very difficult to understand, and the story itself doesn't stand out among other RPGs. Personally, I don't care for the whole medieval politics setup, but it might please some. The good? There are a whole lot of skills and classes to learn and be, and the idea of being able to equip TWO job skills at once makes for some pre-battle strategy. For instance, you can choose to have a hybrid black and white mage, or a knight and a monk, or a summoner and a gunman. It's a nice little touch. The soundtrack is also pretty decent orchestral stuff that can be catchy at times. Nonetheless, the whole experience gets very old after a while. The battles are not very diverse, you just unload your skills on everyone time and time again, the graphics are annoying and the camera can be frustrating, and overall, it just isn't very fun. Get Disgaea: Hour of Darkness for the PS2 instead, which does EVERYTHING much better, is deeper and more stylish, and much more strategy-oriented.	-1
The gameplay of this game is pretty good.  Original, combining the commands and jobs and weapons of Final Fantasy with the turn-based grid-pattern gameplay of Dungeons and Dragons.  It was way too slow, though, and in an age where a gamer will rap out half an hour of play and then save before heading to school/ college/job, hour-long tactical battles just suck.  Especially when you lose most time and have to do them over and over again.  But overall, it'd be a good game. If I could stand to look at it. In this modern era of bump-mapping and CG animations that look real, as in REAL, a game where 'my green dot is beating the heck out of your purple square' just doesn't do the trick for me.  Especially when their purple square always strangles the living snot out of my green dot.  No way.  I'd be willing to bet that the graphics on the GBA are gonna look better than for the PS. So, I played it for three hours and then gave up.  I had an entire row of PS2 generation RPSs to suck up my attention, such as FFX and its sequel.  Which might not have the same old grueling fight system, but I can actually tell that Yuna is a girl, not a green dot with brown lines on her head.	-1
He's a basketball player, yet Shaquille O'Neal made it so big with his basketball career that he thought that he could expose his name in the mid 90's.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Shaq-Diesel/dp/B000007UVD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Shaq Diesel</a>&nbsp;anyone? That was hilarious. Now look what Shaq came up with: a fighting game. Just by having the biggest name on the front of the cover tells enough what the quality of this game really comes out to.  The video game consists of bad punchline dialog before the fights, a plot that's just predictable and stupid, lame graphics, and controls that are so agonizing to handle that it's just completely pointless.  This game was voted one of the worst fighting games for a reason. No need to waste your time on this when there are far superior games released on the SNES with much better plots and controls.	-1
It all happens as soon as you read the title, the acid in your stomache just churns up.  Shaq Fu was one of those gaming horrors of the 90's that should have never been, just like his awful, awful movie career.  I feel like my intelligence decreased after playing it, but back then I was but a mere child and I loved fighting games (as well as RPG's). As such I was easily sucked into playing any fighter that rolled out of a factory, thank god I had only rented this mediocre title.  The graphics were pretty good I'll admit, but then there was Shaq to remind me that I was playing an absolute piece of crap. The characters clobber each other with puns before a battle ensues, oh dear god!! After your brain is crushed from the weight of sheer bad humor the fight starts. At this point you take a deep breath and think "Well at least that's over...". That is if you haven't gotten to the point where your thinking "!$@@&%*@!!^$$#...." and believe me I'll understand if you have.  If you've lasted this long then....I PITY YOUR SOUL!! Anyways, the fight starts and it's incredibly easy...to the point that enjoyment is null and the fact that your playing Shaq Fu doesn't help cure that sudden acid reflux problem either. I beat it in about 20 minutes *yawn* (or was it *urk* I forgot...).  I beg of anyone that's even considering buying this or god forbid, even playing this PLEASE!!! Your not missing a thing, in fact you'll thank me and anyone else that has a similar opinion on the matter. Playing a great 2-D fighter like Samurai Showdown or Street Fighter II is far better than having prematurely gray hair and vomit all over your favorite shirt (and being mentally scarred).  If you own this game, there's an easy cure. Either melt it in a fire or throw it in the sea or anything that makes it dissapear from existance, please don't sell this game to anyone. It's an insult that this game was even made.	-1
This was the worst fighting game on the SNES system. Even worse than the home version of SNK's ART OF FIGHTING and FIGHTER'S HISTORY. The game is not only stupid, it's easy and the characters are really lame. Granted yes, this game was released when Shaquille was really, really big in the mainstream, but after this game, notice how things started to go bad for him. After all, he did KA-ZAAM. But anyway, the controls are bad, the graphics are bad, fights are really predictable (ex: you know what the computer is going to do) and all in all not a fun game. Seriously, SNES had all of the better fighting games so I'm sure you could find one that you like because there are several to choose from. For instance, STREET FIGHTER II series (New Challengers, Hyper, etc), MORTAL KOMBAT II and ULTIMATE MORTAL KOMBAT, FATAL FURY 2 SPECIAL and even BALLZ. Skip SHAQ FU, it's a waste of your time.	-1
This game by any standards is violent. But that's about all that I can say. Sure you can hit a guy in any of the 29 anatomical hit areas programmed into the game. Sure, it's fun to watch a  guy holding a stub of  his foot after you blew it away with a shotgun. But how many of these  images would you really like to see for the next 4 hours until you finally  realize this is just what this game was all about. Nothing else. Graphics:  Nice OpenGL. Might cause some problems with GeForce 256 cards. Interface:  in game save. easy to use multiplayer options. Gameplay: regular shoot-em  up. very formulaic: shoot, blood, run. Do this for 4 hours and you'll  finish the game. Weapons ballistics are not that real. Believe me... I  know. AI: can be intimidating sometimes. Look before you walk into any  area. Story: weak, bad guy wants to blow up world. Overall: You'll get  tired of this game. If you want a good multiplayer experience though, get  this game.	-1

I throughly did not like this game at all. Unless you enjoy being on a set track and taking pictures of pokemon with a limited amount of film and giving them food or bombing them or playing music for them and taking more pictures. Then this game is not for you.	-1
Don't get this game. It is not worth the money. Ok.. you can print the picture out but then you have to buy the pokemon snap card and it costs about $5 and it is just not worth the money. And it is to short. No plot, no challange, might as well go through your photo album, it would be more entertaining	-1
If I could pick the most boring, esiest game in the world,I would pick this one. All you do is z+a=a picture. Throughout the levels you get things like bait and stuff, but unless your a serous camera fan, this game should be reccomended to no one.	-1
This game really sucks! I rented it once for five days and I played it for one day and then I beat it! It was so stupid. It is worse than mario party 3! If you are a first time game player, don't get this game. If you have been playing Games for 50 years,  don't get this game. This is the worst game ever.	-1
Pokemon were cool, yes, there was a time when the great empire of little cuddly creature took America by storm. All 150 (as the new one's don't matter a bit) were great and were a lot of fun to see in the game. Then the franchise went down hill shelling out nothing that could be considered nothing more than drivel. I know this may be a lot for a person of any age who loves pokemon to swallow. But, the franchise is old and is nothing anymore but a waste of money. When, I first got this game I will not lie a bit, I was impressed it was a very fun game and I enjoyed owning it and being able to take pictures of various pokemon. When I finished the game though I was horribly disappointed. There were nowhere near the amount of Pokemon in the game I expected and the game really left little to the imagination (can you believe that, a pokemon game, that leaves little to the imagination?) I wish I could rate this game higher and maybe if there were no alternative it may have rated higher, but there are better games out there and I'm sorry but, I wasted my money on this game.	-1
This game was an extremely easy game that you can beat in 15 minutes. All you do is take pictures of dumb Pokemon. Then when you beat the game you have to try to beat the computers impossible scores. THAT'S IT, DO NOT BUY	-1
This may have been a good game 5 years ago, but compared to recently released games, it is pitiful!!  The graphics are terrible!	-1
I bought this game for my daughter and she get's very frustrated with this game!  It is difficult for a child to figure out what to do next.  I wish we had a guide book/hint book for this game as it would make it a lot easier during those very (and I do mean very) frustating times! If you have patience to try and figure this one out then go for it, but in all honesty I would not recommend purchasing this item, not even at a fantastic deal.  Unless, of course, someone gives it to you for free.	-1
Twisted Metal 1: good Twisted Metal 2: great Twisted Metal 3: good Twisted Metal 4: bad  As a fan of the series I couldn't stand this game for more than 10 minutes.	-1
Some good levels, some good cars. Mostly nothing special, though. If you want a good Twisted Metal game, look elsewhere in teh series. If you want a good vehicular destruction game, look to Vigilante 8 or, better still Interstate 76 or Interstate 82.	-1
I usualy like Castlevania games so when I heard of their was one on Gameboy I bought right away.  That was ... stupid.  But I'll start with it's good qualities.  It doesn't smell.  That's something, right?  Now the bad.  You walk REALLY REALLY slow.  You attack REALLY REALLY slow.  Everything else goes either as fast or faster than you.  When you jump accross platforms unless you jump at the very edge of you won't make it.  The music is just 6 seconds of sound repeated over and over and over and over...  Oh ya, and the graphics look like ....	-1
No it isn't. This is a standard platformer with extremely sluggish control, no secondary weapons, and slow movement. Plus, your whip loses power each time an enemy hits you. This is a pain. The saving grace is that you can obtain a whip that shoots fireballs and the first stage has GREAT music. But that can't save the game. Even CastleVania fans should steer clear of this one.	-1
Early Castlevania games tended to be hit or miss affairs, and unfortunately this is . When I originally posted this review in 2003, I had made a concerted effort to create an honest review for the average player; I was (and still am) quite fond of the game. If I were to redo my rating scale, perhaps I'd score it slightly higher at three stars. All the same, I still feel that this game provides a low amount of fun given the intense challenge, and the rating is deserved given that overriding criteria.  Doesn't the classic GB logo give it away? This is not the fantastic GameBoy Advance title Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, nor is it Circle of the Moon or even Harmony of Dissonance.  What this is might well be described as one of the slowest sidescrollers ever made (and that's without slowdown affecting the game). Made in 1989, this is one of the first titles in Konami's Game Boy lineup and it shows. The level one music (Battle of the Holy) is excellent and a personal favorite, but the aural experience is unfortunately quite limited afterward. I personally like many of the background details (whenever they show up, that is) such as the trees and graves seen at the game's beginning. Much later on the ability to use exploding eyeballs as dynamite to open up a hidden area (no joke!) is a great concept well executed.  The whip Christopher uses in this game may be upgraded once for a chain whip, and once more for flinging fireballs...it's not quite an adequate replacement for the traditional Castlevania subweapons, but it does give you unlimited attacks at range.  Christopher's slowness in this title (and its sequel) makes Simon Belmont's hunched back and slow gait appear like a semi barrelling down the road, whereas Christopher is perhaps the man trying to push a tractor trailer down the road. Suffice to say that he's very slow - hyperbole aside, he seems to move at roughly half the speed of Simon.  The worst part of it would be the intensely difficult jumps found in large quantities. This is the textbook example of frustrating level design: Nearly every single jump must be done within an accuracy of a few pixels. While the most difficult jump in the game requires you time perfectly across two falling platforms-essentially three jumps-is thankfully optional (used to snag a 1-up extra life), since I can only manage it about once in twenty tries (an optimistic guess), the normal jumps are too close to this required accuracy for comfort. One long series of jumps has you going over about a dozen blocks in such a fashion; while there's solid ground below to fall down onto and the process of jumping may always be restarted it's easy to mess up here. A later and quite ugly level where you are chased by spikes for nearly the entire level (and one part consists of climbing upwards and jumping from rope to rope) has the same feel to it, as mistakes tend to get you killed quite often.  There's more. One level starts you off by bats which of course you can't hit right away because while a Castlevania Axe could take them all out, you have no axe, only your whip. Getting through this section unscathed is more a matter of luck than skill.  The end of the game, oddly enough, consists of the easiest Dracula fight since Castlevania 2 (where you could simply lay on the laurels for invincibility for the fight's duration). I won't give it away, but Dracula's second form is even more pathetic, in terms of an attack pattern, than the first (in either case, Dracula looks silly in this one). Given how hard this game is, though, it's probably not a bad thing to have some reprieve.  Are there any more problems? Oh yes, the killer: Getting hit downgrades your weapon one notch, so you essentially play the whole game with the basic short leather whip.  All that said, I do love this game, but it's not easily playable. It brings solid graphics to the GameBoy, but the gameplay...if it is solid, perhaps we would better say that you'll need a jackhammer to scratch the surface of this particular rock.  It gets the second star only because some people consider all terribly difficult games to be a challenge and they might enjoy it somewhat. As I noted, there are some nice points later in the game...unfortunately, just as with the previous year's (1988) Castlevania arcade game (Haunted Castle), most mortals will never see many of its neat details.  My recommendation is to pick up Castlevania 2: Belmont's Revenge instead. You have subweapons, less difficult jumps, a better soundtrack overall, and weapon downgrades have been checked significantly. Pick that one up if you're looking for classic GameBoy action!	-1
There are 5 levels in this game. On my first try I beat 4 levels. It is easy and short! You also can't save the game. If your, let's say, on level 4 and you lose all your lives. Then you have to start at the begining again. ( Kind of like Mario. ) This is the really bad thing. If you turn off your gameboy and turn it on again, you start at level 1 again. It is not fun to keep playing the same levels over and over. I would say this is for little kids that do not get frustiated easly. ( If there is any little kids like that. ) I say pass this up, Kirby fans, and try another game.	-1
I don't know about the other incarnations of Batman Returns, but the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version is downright atrocious. The controls are stiff and slow, Batman himself moves at a snails pace and is frequently unable to move out of the way of oncoming enemies. The sound effects are awful and the combat system is very, very poor. Such a shame considering&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Batman/dp/B000KLMPIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Batman</a>&nbsp;was so good. Even the music in this one disappoints in comparison to the brilliant tunes in the first game. The only positive thing I can mention about this waste of time and effort are the nice looking graphics which really evoke the gloomy, wintry feel of a frozen Gotham City. Otherwise, avoid!  Graphics B- Sound D Gameplay F Lasting Appeal D-	-1
this is a good batman game..its  just a tad too difficult  LOL  the graphics are dark and gloomy  perfect for batman  but they lack the visual detail  of the movie  but a good job by sega :)  now the super nintendo's batman returns is a excellent game  which i still play to this day..the graphics are well done.. the music is from the movie..and had digitized scenes from the film.. the other batman game that is really done right is by sunsoft  ..:Batman the video game" from the 89 movie again for the genesis.. all in all if your a batman fan get all of these games..	-1
I'm rather baffled by all the positive reviews for this game.  I bought it a couple months ago after reading all the good reviews and thinking this game must be a shining gem that has withstood the test of time.  Well, now I'm rethinking that assumption... No doubt many people will disagree with me, but on with the review!  Graphics (6/10): Sigh. Everything is pixelated. I'm not sure whether the graphics for this game were considered good when the game was released or not. On the bright side, the character designs are good as well as the towns.  The dungeons are another matter, but more on that later.  Music (6/10): I still can't figure out why people claim this game has a great soundtrack.  I've even heard people claim that Grandia's music is some of their most favorite of all time.  I wonder if Grandia is the only RPG they've ever played?  Anyway, the majority of the tracks weren't too bad. Unfortuneately, I remember some pretty bad ones.  There's one jungle where the "music" seems to only be ambient jungle wildlife sounds, which got annoying after the 50th bird call.  Unlike others, I found the Gumbo song to be one of the most annoying village themes ever.  It's okay right at first, but then starts to grate on your nerves the longer you stay in the village.  One more thing-the voice acting deserves mention.  It's bad.  I rank it as the worst voiceing I've ever heard in a game.  It sounds like they literally pulled people off the street and offered them $10 to read off some lines. Terrible.  Characters (7/10): The characters are interesting at first, until you realize that everyone's the same.  All possess the same plucky, happy-go-lucky adventurer personality.  I have nothing against light-hearted games, but everyone really did seem to have the exact same personality; there was just no balance to the party.  Speaking of party, there was a high rate of people joining and then permanently leaving, this (or something else?) really meant that no one really got any siginificant character development.  Most everyone had no back story of interest (or at all) and were not well developed.  Story (5/10): Here's where Grandia really starts to "sag in the saddle", so to speak.  The first 1/4 of the game and the last 1/4 are interesting and engaging.  I really enjoyed the start in Parm; rummaging through people's houses, reading Justin's diary for some amusing stories, and laughing at the way any alcoholic references were changed to "coffee".  Man, those were good times.  Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there.  The middle of the game becomes a neverending series of filler events.  The first couple "villages in need" or "musty old ruins to explore" didn't bother me at all, but after that, I started to feel like I was stuck on the wheel of karma or something.  It just got really repetitive, until I just knew the next village I came to would have to be saved by me from some disaster.  Well, what I refer to as the "main" story picked about the last quarter of the game, but it wasn't nearly original or interesting enough to make up for the huge amount of filler crap in the middle.  By then, only my sheer will power kept me playing to the end.  Battle System (8/10): Nothing really wrong with the battle system.  It's a variant of turn-based, with a small bar in the corner indicating who will go next.  While the bar does let you see when you're characters will go, I didn't really find it all that useful.  What keeps this section from a perfect score is the abilities-and how you level them up.  Using them over and over again strengthens your magic, but not how you'd expect. SPEED increases, not strength.  I found this very frustrating and pointless. The speed doesn't really increase enough to make much difference- and leveling spells takes forever.  Gameplay (4/10): Was the rotating camera really necessary? I've played games with rotating camera angles (like Xenogears) that worked just fine, but in this game it doesn't.  The problem lies in dungeon navigation. If the graphics had been better, or if there had been better dungeon design, perhaps navigation wouldn't be so confusing.  It's really hard to tell where you are because the dungeon design is so bland and repetitive; there are usually no landmarks with which to navigate, with the result that I actually wound up back at the entrance thinking it was the exit. On another note, something else that bothered me was the fact that even by the end of the game, you couldn't really return to much of anywhere you had been previously.  I kept expecting be able to return to Parm eventually, but no such luck.  *NOTE: This part's an extremely important part--the game is glitchy.  It would freeze randomly, forcing me to reset and start over.  The cds themselves were in good condition with almost no scratches of any kind, and I've heard this same complaint before, which leads me to believe the glitches are a flaw of the game design.  This is a huge turnoff--this added in extra frustration to an already boring game. This flaw knocks points off the score.  Overall (4/10): Note this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score.  I must say, given the flaws of this game, I'd never play it again. It's too bad really, it could've been a decent game if the makers had cut out the middle of the "plot" and fixed the glitches.  I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless they absolutely have played every other good RPG out there and are just dying for something else to play.  Even then, it may be better to just replay an old favorite instead.	-1
Strange how some people regard Grandia as the best Saturn RPG and one of the best on the PlayStation. While Grandia possesses some interesting qualities, it is completely dismantled by a series of devastating flaws that cripple the game. This review will be formulaic, but it will get the point across.  The graphical engine was very good. 2D characters and 3D environments that can be rotated at will. I like nuances, and Grandia possesses many. I like knocking over teapots and making clotheslines as I walk into them. The spell effects were boring, however, and the FMV, while technically good at the time, just wasn't exciting.  The music is overwrought and almost silly. The main themes seem bombastic and pretentious, as if the game is saying, "Come look at me, I'm important!" The compositions are impressive musically, but they feel emotionally hollow. There is one song, a piano & violin duet, which I loved. It was completely gorgeous. I also liked how the combat music changed as the game continued. RPGs often frustrate me by giving me the same combat music through the entire 40 hour game.  In Grandia, using specific kinds of magic or weapons makes you more skilled in that capacity. Naive gamers have said that Grandia's character growth system is innovative and interesting. It is not innovative, in my mind, and not interesting. Such systems have been done in 8-bit Final Fantasy games and reams of Japanese RPG with lower profiles (the SaGa games come to mind). Also, because the game is so long, you'll probably learn every spell and weapon technique about 50% though the game. Since this removes any real incentive to engage in combat, all future battles are suffocating in how boring they are. The combat is boring. This is mainly because it is incredibly easy. I didn't spend extra time advancing my characters (I tried to finish the game ASAP, actually), so I definitely wasn't too strong. Still, not a single boss offered any form of challenge. Even the final boss felt like nothing more than a ponderous standard encounter. It seems evident to me that a game cannot be exciting when there is no threat...no sense of danger or challenge. This wouldn't be _that_ bad if the battles didn't take so long. So, you get thousands of long, boring, simple fights over the course of the game. The dungeons are amateur in design, and made about 10 times more dreadful because of the combat. There's also a gauge in combat that shows when when each character will take an action. However, this does not create any real strategy because all the characters move at different speeds, so it's just a funky gimmick.  The story is not bad, but it is badly told. It uses about every hackneyed Japanese RPG element imaginable, but it doesn't remedy this problem with interesting characters or compelling twists. The translation is just dumb. Sony broke it down to simple diction and pure, fatuous juvenalia. The "romantic" relationship between Justin and Feena is basically insulting -- it has the maturity of an elementary school infatuation. Sue is an utterly pointless character, who's involvement in the story is simple arbitrary and ridiculous. What is the creature "Puffy"? The game never explains. I expected some kind of enigmatic quality to the creature, with a revelation disclosing all at some point (like Nall in Lunar). This never happens. It's stupid. The voice acting is hideous. Attemps at humor fall flat. Attempts at emotional expression are cringe-inducing.  The game took me about 50 hours to beat (though I tend to be slower than some). In my mind, the game is about 35 hours too long. So, expect the "meat" of the story to be padded with superfluous side-quests packed with obnoxious combat and torturous dialogue. I like side-quests...when they are optional or purposeful. In this game, the side-quests are neither. Adventures in a ghost ship or on a mysterious prehistoric valley might sound fun on paper, but without important story revelations or fun gameplay, it's boring. Granted about 10 hours of the game is pretty interesting. But that's a mere 20% of the game. In school, that would be an 'F'...a FAILING grade.  The game is just tedious. It's boring and insipid and hackneyed to death. I'm sure there will be many who say, "Grandia rulez! you lie!" and give me a "not helpful" vote. I didn't write this to please anybody...I wrote it because I think Grandia does not deserve the praise it receives. Heed my word, and perhaps you will save 50 hours of you life. That's a long time! 50 Law & Order episodes! A genuinely good RPG! Think about it.	-1
I would say that video games don't come much simpler than this bore but the likes of Pong and Pac-Man, while less technically sophisticated are still better. Golden Axe 2 is such a chore to play with no fun or enjoyment injected into the proceedings whatsoever.  Again, you can choose from barbarian Ax Battler, amazonian Tyris Flare or dwarf Gillius Thunderhead as you slowly plod your way through a generic as hell fantasy kingdom, hacking and slashing at conveyor belt enemies (who sometimes kill themselves out of sheer stupidity) before you get to the big guy in a suit of armour who has taken over the land because of his evilness or whatever nonsense.  I often associate Golden Axe with Streets of Rage since the gameplay in the first games was very similar (I also bought them on the same day back in March 1993). But while the SOR series only got better and more sophisticated I am afraid that Golden Axe just got crapper. It tries to be the gaming equivalent of a big budget Conan movie but comes off as no more than a Roger Corman mini-series. You've never played a game so stripped down and bland as this.  Graphics D+ Sound D- Gameplay D- Lasting Appeal F  Pros:  It's a lot like Golden Axe  Cons:  It's a LOT like Golden Axe  Sound effects are no more than white noise.  Baddies all look the same.  No point system.  Very, very little in the way of power ups.  No combo moves.  Collision detection is poor.  Music is just ghastly.	-1
When this game was released in 1993, the Ninja Turtles' popularity was declining so Konami took advantage of the fighting game market (that was booming thanks to the popularity of Street Fighter 2) I would have to thank that lame third movie for the declining popularity plus copycats like Biker Mice from Mars and Battletoads that were taking its place.  The Genesis version on the game proved to be the worst on many occassions.  Although it had the best storyline and graphics, it was too dark and difficult for kids plus the controls were sloppy, the game play was slow, the music score was awful, and the taunt button was a waste. Shredder was no where to be found in this game and the only connections to the 1987 cartoon series was Krang and the Technodrome.  The image was drawn closer to Mirage comics, especially when this game was suppose to be marketed for kids, but even teens and young adults can get fustrated and bored as well.  I wouldn't recommend this product if you are looking for a good fighting game.  This is not the worst fighting game, but it could have done better.	-1
I used to love this game before he was caught brown handed in the 4 year old chocolate cookie jar. Typical of Michael to make sure he has a fun game for little boys! Looking at this game now it's so dirty. You have to run around saving little boys oh yeah girls to. Hmm. Michael didn't like girls but i bet he just didn't wanna look suspicious! Good by and good riddance!	-1
A 'fun' arcade game it may well have been in it's day, but one cannot play Moonwalker today without feeling dirty or somewhat guilty. Based on the 'movie' of the same name, Moonwalker is just as weird, bizarre and outrageously self-glorifying as Wacko Jacko himself.  You take on the role of a suspected pedo, dressed in a white gangster suit, who must rescue children (hidden in closets, drawers, garbage cans) from the evil Mr. Big. Upon being rescued these kids respond joyously with 'MICHAEL', knowing that they are now safe with the King of Pop. You need to rescue all the little sprogs in every level before you meet the end-level boss. But some children are too well hidden.  And who IS this Mr. Big exactly. The Jacko of 1989 fighting against a child-napper, who's motives for stealing kids is unknown in the game, seems prophetic in a split-personality kind of way. Just like in Thriller where he played a ghoulish, inhuman beast, eerily foreshadowing the future.  The gameplay itself is ludicrous. As you (moon)walk across the various levels (some generic, some inspired by his 'classic' music videos) you'll encounter baddies like gangsters and zombies and your amazing way of killing them is...dancing them do death. Seriously! It's not Jesus Juice, it's Jacko Jamming! You hit the special attack button and Jacko will suddenly yell 'OW!' before strutting his lethal stuff. After which, the baddies will be vanquished somehow. After playing this game you'll be exhilarated and mentally exhausted at Jacko's killer moves. You'll be reduced to a dribbling wreck. He's so good, that even passing-by animals will join in and shake their asses. If you ever wanted to play a game in which even an innocent dog is hypnotised by Jacko into dancing Thriller then this is for you. But I don't want to know you.  The music is no more than low-quality samples of Smooth Criminal and Thriller, as you should know this music follows Jacko everywhere he goes in real life and will change depending on where he is.  In the later levels, if you catch a falling star Jacko will turn into a huge robot. Of course. Like in the film, I just can't get over the feeling that Jacko only included this because he wants to see himself 100 feet high. It's ridiculous and has nothing to do with anything! But in a moronic, hopelessly out-dated video game I suppose it's okay. It was kind of easy to finish too and I never really played it again afterwards. But these days, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and I can understand why no one would want to play it again.  Graphics C  Sound C  Gameplay D  Lasting Appeal F	-1
I've played a lot of games that to this day can be considered old. Some of them have aged well thanks to their long lasting charms and innovations, but from this I've earned an experience: I have learned that if the opening music to the game is astronomically good, it's a bad game. Few games apply to this rule, but it is still present particularly in long forgotten manure fests like Deep Blue for the Turbo Grafix 16... and this game.  Right out, the game starts with an incredible opening song, one that sounds catchy, jazzy and dire all at the same time. Then you actually play the game and see the graphics and the hook has dislodged itself from your interest.  I'm not going to say that the graphics are bad, especially not at a first glance, but SA uses a very dull color palette consisting of almost limelight tints where the shirts of thugs will appear too green for their own good and the palette loves to over-use the color gray... a lot. You'll encounter a lot of gray backgrounds in this game save for maybe the park levels which actually resemble forests.  The game play on the other hand is criminal. I don't want to sound like the average game whiner that whines about older games and how hard they were, but I know when a game is being unfair and when I just suck at a game and SA takes the former in astronomic measurements. I never thought Venom or Spidey could take so much damage from wimpy looking thugs, athletic gymnast women who use their hair as whips and headband wearing drunks armed with flintlocks (yes, I'm serious).  The enemies in this game are a pain. Some of them are really cheap particularly the wimpy, saggy-shorts jerks in the first level that leap at you from across the screen and the aforementioned gymnasts, but they only get more cheap from there, especially when they throw in guys with Cable-like guns and Iron Man wannabes.  I think my favorite boss in the whole game was the first level boss; he's one of the cheapest bosses you'll encounter, but the animation for him (or it, it's a robot, really) is SO funny that it's actually cute. It's like watching a cat walk over the dried surface of a previously rain-proof coated deck as they shake their paws of the sticky feeling before taking another step, it's that funny.  You can climb on walls in some levels, but your movement is restricted to the level. Of course, speak of the devil and he shall appear... let's talk about the real nightmare in this unconscious dream state of a game (that analogy sucks):  The levels are long, samey brawler levels consisting of streets, a forest-like park, a bridge and a factory and you're going to run through each one for what feels like five minutes straight encountering the exact same enemies and occasionally having the choice of taking different paths which wastes time more than the average game should.  None of this is helped by the looped music of each level with only three level songs total; imagine playing through eight levels with only three different songs over and over again, all of which are dwarfed by the opening song that first played.  You do get additional help in the game such as Marvel cameos who come out of nowhere once you pick up their icon, but sometimes they don't really help you; some of them have very specific reasons to help you like clearing the screen of enemies or blocking projectiles and in most cases they'll just run on screen, do something for a few seconds, disappear and leave you to continually get your posterior slammed into chewed gum.  And if you're hoping the ending and final boss is worth encountering, they really aren't. I'd say buy it for the opening music or a goofy gold robot, but are any of those really valid reasons? I think I'd rather re-coat the deck, wait for it to dry, find any spots that still have those dried, but sticky patches on them and have the cat walk over it again... and to add, I'll join in the fun by walking with her barefoot.  If you want game with your nihilism however, then come get some.	-1
Did not like it. It did not play at all. I put it in the Sega Genesis and the only thing that came up when I turned it on was a red screen. Tried it many other times, outcome still the same.	-1
X-Men is a fun game... on ameatur difficulty level.  When I cranked it up to Hero (since you can't get any farther than the third level on ameatur), I found it almost impossible to do anything.  I got tired of playing the levels all over again, fighting the same, almost randomly apearing enemies coming from doors at any moment and surrounding me.  Although the game may have captured the feel of the X-Men, I didn't think they did a good job with the actual game aspect, which is probably the most important thing.  If you want to play a good Marvel game, try Marvel Super-heroes: war of the Gems.  It is much more balanced and fun than Sega's attempt at making an X-men game.	-1
The supposed included poster was missing bummer to a fan.	-1
I have been playing video games my entire life and this game is the worst game I have ever played. You can't walk two steps without fighting an enemy and it takes hours to go through one very small castle because of this. The gameplay is horrid,and boring, the music is painfully redunant. Everything about this game sucks! I threw it in the trash!	-1
I know there's some of you who'd like to see this game get 1 star, but come on, it's not THAT bad. For example,the music, although not excellent throughout, is pretty good. My favorites are the Volcano, Boss, and Gale Mountain themes. The Boss theme is ESPECIALLY good,though, one of the best I've heard. I know that many of you complain, "Oh, I don't like the random battles." Well let me ask you this: Would you prefer 10 (TEN) MANDATORY battles on the world map before you can go on to the next area? I didn't think so. The dungeons and caves are a different story, though, as you can avoid most enemies (they appear onscreen)--unless you're going down a one-way tunnel. So the battles are a mixed bag, as you can see. Next, being a very early SNES title, the graphics and story are very bland--compared to later Squaresoft titles. Amazingly enough, I'm GLAD that Squaresoft made this game. Yes, GLAD. Why? Because when a system first comes out, companies aren't too sure what the full potential of that system is. Wouldn't it be dreadful if Squaresoft tried to put their BEST storyline, characters, music, gameplay, you name it, into this first game--only to realized that the SNES can't handle it, or that they could have done better later on? So I guess you could call this an EXPERIMENTAL Squaresoft game, just a way of sticking one's toe in the water. And before you start slapping your green numbers down in front of the cashier or reaching for the DOWNLOAD button, I suggest that you read other reviews--do a Google search or something--beforehand.	-1
It takes two hits to kill every enemy, except bosses.  The undead bosses take one hit -- one cureall spell.  If your age is in the double digits in years, this game will probably be too simple for you.  NOT RECOMMENDED.	-1
This was, without a doubt the worst Final Fantasy game that I've ever played. Even Final Fantasy II had it's moments, but this game just annoyed me... The same great music you remember is here, but everything else was left at the curb. Fuzzy-looking graphics, characters lacking any sort of personality or conviction, overly simplistic storyline, these are just afew words I would use to describe this game. And it's not just that this game is lame in comparison to other Final Fantasy games! On the contrary, this was the first Final Fantasy game that I ever played, and if it weren't for the fact that I had already ordered Final Fantasy IV online, then this game would've stopped me from ever buying another one ever again.  The only thing that I actually liked about this game is that monsters showed visible damage once their health was decreased past it's half way point, wish they would've put that into other Final Fantasy games... Other than that, this game should be avoided... You're better off spending your money on another Final Fantasy game. Whichever one you choose, it's sure to be better than this.	-1
I am a huge final fantasy fan. But this is just dumb.  Basiclly its a final fantasy ripping of legend of zelda. What were they smokeing when they came out with this!!!!!!!!!	-1
This really isn't a part of the Final Fantasy series.  It's just labeled as such so it would sell better here in the US.  And yes... you can really jump in this game...	-1
This game is the worst final fantasy game I've ever had the misfortune to play. The bad graphics are only masked by the horrific gameplay & loss of convincing Heros, not to mention the absence of convincing story-lines that made the Final Fantasy series such a huge hit! The only fantasy that comes to mind when playing this game is the fantasy of killing yourself or throwing it out the window and praying to God for the souls of the people who put this game on the market. I warn all new-comers to the final fantasy world: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME! If your looking for a good final fantasy game to start up with I recomend Final Fantasy I & II Dawn of Souls for the GameBoy Advance, or Final Fantasy Origins for the PSone.

Some might say that to compare Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest to the rest of the series is unfair, since it was clearly aimed at a younger audience.  However, when you use a brand name to sell a product, the product had better live up to that name.  This game is not a Final Fantasy game, and only a complete FF completist should own it.  It takes under 10 hours to beat, and even a six year-old could probably beat it.  That's pretty much the point of it.  Final Fantasy II and III for the SNES are far, far better than this monstrosity, and they still remain my two favorite games of all time. Save your money and buy those instead.	-1
This is the black sheep of the Final Fantasy family.  It is barely mentioned in any discussion about Final Fantasy and there is a very good reason.  This is the worst game that I have played that actually bears the Final Fantasy name.  Simply put: this game is not good.  By the time this game was released, Squaresoft had give us a simplified version of Final Fantasy IV and called it Final Fantasy II.  FFII was more complex and had a deeper story than Mystic Quest.  The American audience had proven that we could handle more complex RPGs, but the next Final Fantasy we got was the children's game Mystic Quest. I finished Mystic Quest the first time in about 8-9 hours (at most), and after that I could beat the game in less than 6 hours.  Had there been an actual story to the game, this would have been just a warm-up, but instead the game was complete.  Mystic Quest would have worked better as a side scrolling adventure RPG rather than a straight RPG.  As it stands, the game is closer in feel to Final Fantasy Adventure for the Gameboy than any Final Fantasy in the numbered series.  The story is simple: gather crystals and save the world (okay, FF I and IV had this story, too).  The gameplay was far too easy.  Most enemies would go down in one or two hits, and you can just fly through the game learning some spells and whacking enemies. My description isn't quite doing justice to how dull the game is and how little fun it is to play.  Because of the weakness of this game, the only positive is that the game is so short.  If you must play it, go into it with no expectations.  If you want to play a good SNES RPG, try Final Fantasy II or III, or Chrono Trigger.  If you do play this game, remember to use the Cure spell on the final boss.  It makes life easier.	-1
Though any SNES game bearing the title "Final Fantasy" can now be called a collector's item, this is definitely the least sought after of the bunch. This is a hard game to appreciate having experienced parts 4 and 6, but for younger gamers, this is the perfect game. The story is strictly storybook-standard fodder, non-violent and pleasing to simple minds. The graphics and music are not even worth mentioning, as they cannot rightfully be called Final Fantasy material. But considering the target market, it would be unfair to totally trash this game. If I had a son, I would get this game for him as an into into RPGs. The better installments could wait. I wouldn't  call this game the "Worst RPG Of All Time", since I have played much, much worse.	-1
I know this is going to sound like sacrilege but I was never a fan of the Mortal Kombat games. Having played&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Street-Fighter-II-Special-Champion-Edition/dp/B00002SUD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Street Fighter II' Special Champion Edition</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fatal-Fury/dp/B000035XLK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fatal Fury</a>&nbsp;before it I just didn't see much point in another fighting franchise.  Plus, the digitised graphics, which were supposed to be 'groundbreaking' and make us all go 'ooohhh, ahhh' were just really rubbish. They were so blocky and resembled just a few big, chunky pixels vaguely in the shape of a human. I tired of it pretty quickly I'm afraid to say but a few months after I stopped playing it I went back after finding cheat codes in a magazine to restore the censored gore. But even that was dumb!  A gallon of blood splattered into the air every time you punched someone and it just looked so stupid that it had no edge. And then later on I got the cheats for the finishing moves and 'babalities' and 'animalities' or whatever such nonsense. But by that point they just took it too far and I never went back to it again. The sequels never took my interest either.  Not the best fighting game by far.  Graphics C Sound C Gameplay C Lasting Appeal C+	-1
THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST VERSIONS OF THE ORIGINAL GAME YOU CAN BUY. THE GRAPHICS ARE HORRIBLE, THE FIGHTS ARE BORING, AND THIS VERSION JUST LACKS THE DEPTH OF THE SUPER NINTENDO VERSION. ONLY REASON I DON'T GIVE THIS THING 1 STAR IS BECAUSE OF THE CODE THAT YOU CAN USE TO UNLOCK THE GORE AND THE FATALITIES THAT AREN'T FOUND ON THE OTHER VERSION. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, STICK WITH THE FAR SUPERIOR SUPER NINTENDO VERSION. THIS VERSION AIN'T WORTH LOOKING FOR.	-1
you create things. That's about it. You also fight these little flying lizard-things that pour our of a hole in the ground until you build a building over it. This game will keep you entertained for about an hour,then it gets boring quickly. My advice is to rent the game before buying it.	-1
Ever since SOR 3 came out in 1994 I wanted it. I never actually managed to get my hands on it until last year as it went for insane prices on auction sites and was very, VERY hard to come by in video game stores. Luckily for me I was given it as a present from someone clearing out their attic. I couldn't wait to get home and play it. All I could think about was loads of hours of solid beat-em-up action and a return of those ultra-cool tunes by Yuzo Koshiro that made the first two games so memorable.  As soon as I started to play I was shocked that Streets of Rage 3 is actually a really, really bad game that may be impressive in terms of graphics but in regards to music and gameplay is far, far behind even the first.  First of all the game is just too damn hard. And you need to play  it in hard mode otherwise you won't be able to get past level 5. And this time we're given a little bit more story and cut-scenes between the game levels. If you're playing the American or European release of this game I'd just skip these as they do not make sense and there are holes everywhere. The Japanese version (Bare Knuckle 3) has a different plot entirely and looks and feels like the REAL Streets of Rage 3.  In SOR 3 the story has Mr. X, in what limited capacity he now exists in, kidnap the Chief of Police and plant bombs all over city. He wants to replace high-ranking officials with evil robots. Or something! So, typically, the gang set about smashing the Syndicate AGAIN as their way of stopping him.  However, in Bare Knuckle 3 the opening cut-scenes with the nuclear explosion show the destruction of a city called 'Wood Oak' that was the first victim of a radioactive bomb powered by the newly discovered element 122, Laxine. The victims are given as an estimated 30,000 dead and 80,000 injured.  In a letter from Blaze to Axel she says that the Syndicate's laboratories seem to be involved in the research of Laxine and that a group in favor of a war with the country of Lima have captured the army general Petrov.  Mr. X tries to start a nuclear war by replacing the anti-war U.S. General with Shiva before a speech at the White House. In SOR 3 'City Hall' looks suspiciously like the White House so I'm led to believe that the level was just recycled and renamed.  In Bare Knuckle 3 you have to successfully prevent a devastating war by rescuing the general and the destruction in the city is just a slap in the face, while in SOR3 you basically have failed your task if you let the time run out (the General, now 'Chief of Police' is killed with poisonous gas). If you rescue the Chief in time you go straight to Mr. X's island lab, but if he dies you go to City Hall/White House.  Second, Yuzo Koshiro's music is HORRIBLE. What happened? The first 2 games had awesome music that showed what the meager Sega Genesis was capable of. The man was truly a pioneer when it came to composing stunning music for simple machines. In SOR 3 there are no cool tunes at all. It's all pathetic, tepid Industrial junk that would sound rancid coming from an Atari. A MAJOR let-down considering how amazing&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Streets-of-Rage-Two/dp/B00005ATJL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Streets of Rage Two</a>&nbsp;was.  SOR 3 also has deleted characters that feature only in the Japanese version. Namely the character of 'Ash' who looks very, very homosexual and resembles Bennett from Commando or one of The Village People. I guess the PC Powers That Be thought the Western World couldn't handle such obvious gayness. The dialogue is also censored and 'naughty' words are replaced with 'clean' words. Character names are also radically and inexplicably different.  If you want this badly then the Japanese version is the ONLY way to go. Seriously, it's a complete disappointment otherwise. I'm not saying that the Japanese version is great, it's only slightly better.	-1
This game has not aged well.  This is a bad game and unplayable for all but the most nostalgic.	-1
Very, very, very obsolete, ffiv(ii) aged very poorly, remakes improves over original 10-100-1000 times My gripes for this version are: 1)graphics are awful, more then a snes game, this looks as a nes game. 2)easy version for the us audience, is too damn easy 3)no dush button, the game is terrible slow 4)very bad and censored script 5) Where's the ATB gauge? without gauge, the ATB is pointless 6) conversion is terrible! Cut everything! Cut magics, cut skills, censored text, cut out difficulty, this is tolerable?  My gripes for this game itself 1) music is annoying, 20 seconds MIDI endlessly repeated 2)short game, less then 20 hours 3)The plot has absolutely zero depth or detail 4)primitive gameplay, no job system, no esper system, no materia system, nothing of nothing 5)don' t even choose party members, the story choose your party ( most strategic game ever eh?) 6)the game world is too generic, no information at all. The game has 8 countries, but, you do not know anything about them. 7) no description of items 8) in the equipment shops, you don't see the changes of statistics 9)too large party so little time, characters don't receive a true development besides kain or cecil 10)Rosa is the worst feminine character ever, zero depht, zero background, I don't know any information about her, besides she's the white mage of the castle and love Cecil 11)Cecil start evil? Don't make me laugh!!!! In the very first scene it's already a good guy! 12)dungeons are boring! Cave, cave, cave, cave, mountain , cave, cave, cave....  Graphics 1/10 sound 5/10 story 3/10 characters development 5/10 gameplay 4/10 fun factor 3/10  Whit this UNBIASED review of ff2(4)I'm trying to help the new rpg gamers often deceived from nostalgic o fanboy reviewers. My advertise? If you want so badly play final fantasy 4 try the psp version( the best version) is 100% improvement over this, or try the ds version if you like cartonish and blocking graphics.  Stay away from the terrible gba version, loaded with bugs, bad control, bad sound and low difficult.  Psx version is basically uncensored japanese hard-type snes version with a couple of fmv and the dash button, decent version but really no any real improvement.	-1
Now I remember renting this game as a kid, boy is it terrible!!  This game isn't worth the $4 I paid for it... the fact that I played it for 5 mins is why I gave it 2 stars rather than one!	-1
MORE LIKE MARIO LAME..	-1
This game is dum. All you do is go around looking for Mario. There's no action, no fun, no nothing. I can't beleive people bought this boring, pointless, and funless waste of money.	-1
Mario is Missing is the worst Mario game on the face of Earth. Nintendo shouldn't have given Software Toolworks the Mario license. Mario is Missing is a horrible crummy educational game that isn't really educational.	-1
It was ok.	-1
This has got to be one of the most boring mario games I ever played as a child. First of all theres no action no challenges which the bad guys can't kill you, All your doing is just playing as luigi pointlessly running all around the world searching for pointless clues of history to find mario and that's absolutely no fun at all, Your better off going back to school studying world history than to play this game no less.  If you want an epic mario game for your SNES look no further than SUPER MARIO RPG LEGEND OF THE SEVEN STARS instead, But yeah avoid this sorry excuse for entertainment.  Overall 0/5 stars from me!	-1
This game is about as exciting as going to the library to read UA history books.  Literally that is all you do, find items, find their place in history, fill in your history book and that's it.  Plus hours of walking around looking for turtles which can't hurt you.  The bosses or enemies in this "game" cannot hurt you....where the hell is the fun in that?!?!?!?  This is easily the worst game ever, even worse than the NES version.	-1
fun game, doesn't work well on PS3.	-1
You are god... literally in this game. The point of this game is that your blue tribe must survive and destroy the rival red tribe. You play as god, with a birds eye view of their world, and you flatten land for them to build houses and castles, and you create hazards for the rival tribes, such as floods, swamps, knights to destroy and burn their villages, and even create huge mountains from nothing. This is a good game, for the first level! But then there are around 400 levels, each with different lands, featurings deserts, snow, grass and dirt. Each level takes about an hour to three hours to complete, so it gets very boring! Also, pretty poor graphics.	-1
This game is one of those titles that you either love or hate, and while its more loved than hated, I'm going to say that I don't like this very much. Now, I know that multiple people have wrote the same type of review here, but this game frustrated me so much that I felt that I needed to chime in as well, along with the two others who wrote a similar review to mine.  On one note, I actually loved the color and diverse environments in this game, but there are two major flaws. The menu is extremely excruciatingly difficult to navigate through, you have to keep pressing X and Y all over again to find what you need, and the battle system is simply unforgiving. You have to wait for your attack to charge and sometimes you don't have time to wait for your attack to charge, and you end up getting gang beaten by all the monsters around you because your sword does not even hit the monster half the time, (yes you heard me right!!) half the time!!! That is unacceptable especially for an action RPG.  For a turn-based RPG I may understand, but even on turn-based RPGs enemy evades rarely happen, and only happen when the character has an agility lowering spell cast on, but no in Secret of Mana, you have to miss the enemy more than 50% of the time trying to hit it and it really aggravates me!! There is one more thing about this game that is an absolute deal-breaker. When you try to exit a room, you have to forcefully gather your characters by either hitting select, or going back towards them, but what if an enemy is still in the way, well you character meets the reaper!! This is the epitome of poor game design, I absolutely cannot fathom that this game has even passed testing, let alone getting the Nintendo Seal of Quality back in its release in 1993, and being re-released on Virtual Console without the AI problems addressed! Thank goodness I only wasted $8 on this game, and not $60 on a SNES cart. Please play Breath of Fire II, or Chrono Trigger instead, or if you really want an action RPG, you can play Illusion of Gaia or Zelda: Link to the Past; you will thank me later!!	-1
Sunset Riders is just like any of the TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtls) games except this one has cowboys and it's set in the old wild wild west. You play as 4 different sherriffs (Bob, Billy, Steve? and Cormano) and your objective is to take down the most evil and dangerous men in the wild wild west. O.k. this is what makes this game stupid, the enemy to hero ratio is completely off. There are always a lot more enemies than heroes on the screen for the most part and that makes this easy game a little confusing and a little too challenging seeing as how if you get hit like once or twice, you die and when a screen full of bad guys shoots 8 bullets in all different directions, it's kind of hard to didge. Turtles in Time is a much better 2 player game but if you're looking for a slight change of pace, here's your chance with this cowboy shoot em up.	-1
Krusty's Fun House is a reverse Lemmings. Instead of saving the rats, you kill them to rid your Fun House of all these nasty rats. Honestly, I didn't like this one because it wasn't as gradual as Lemmings or even progressive at that. What I noticed when I played this game is that the first few boards are real easy and then suddenly, it shifts to brutally hard! Not cool. That and after you get past maybe one or two real hard boards, it goes back to being way too easy. Krusty's Fun House is a sleeper. It got real boring real quick. Plus when it all came down to it, it was the same board over or and over again with just a few shifts of obstacles and a background change, but still it was the same level. I think Lemmings would be a better buy because it's more challenging and a lot funnier.	-1
The product asked for did not work with either the Playstation 1 or the Playstation 3. I did like the fact that a game was included that was not part of the product I had ordered. Though it to did not have the complete game that I had wanted.	-1
why is this game so expensive???!!!  It was by far the worst megaman game ( along with x5 and x6).  And i beat them all might i add.  But x3 had nothing new.  The only two things new is u can play as zero. BUT if u die with him, he is gone for the rest of the game.  And there are 8 capsules.  But 4 are the normal armor and the other 4 are extras.  But u can only get one extra.  Megaman x1 is alot better and so is x4.  Get those two and u are set.	-1
I consider myself a very good gamer in the sense that I have good eye hand coordination and exellent timing. When I got this game for a buck, I figured it would be as good as the other tiny toons titles (bab's big break, Tiny toons for the nes). What I got was a game that was good for the first level and then pathetic afterwards. It really proves too much of a challenge too early. The only way that I beat the game was playing it through "children" mode. This took a lot of the fun out of it however because there are no boss battles. All in all, not a good game, try the other ones though.	-1
Complicated Storyline - there is often a limited sense of direction. Although your objectives/directions are usually handed from an NPC in a town, a castle or a cave, you may still find yourself having to keep a pen and paper handy so you won't forget where to go.  Item Confusion - the magical properties of certain items aren't always clear, such as the: Charm Top, the Amulet and the Magic Seal.  Repetitive Nature  - the battles with enemies seem extemely repetitive at times; enemies always re-spawn when you walk off the screen. If you come back into a room, you'll be fighting them again. In case you think there was something you missed at a castle, all your enemies are back to greet you.  Untimely Deaths - if there's enough powerful enemies on the screen, there's also the risk that your party will get killed off before you cast a single spell. Even though Chrono Trigger utilizes the beautiful Secret of Mana graphics engine - 'Mana' was not only an easier plot to follow but it also didn't have a turn-based battle dynamic like Chrono Trigger. With Chrono, you can't even evade enemies if they're directly in your path. You'll be rolling through every single enemy in the game unless you run away during the battles.  Poor Shopping Dynamic - Nearly all the shops in game sell the same stuff. The shop in Medina has cool stuff but the goods are hideously expensive. By the time you have enough coins, the items in your inventory are likely already better. Enemies in the game never drop anything but gold, experience points and replenishment to your HP/MP. All your gear is coming out of a treasure chest in some dungeon.  Poor Characterization - all your playable characters are one-dimensional and have very feeble personalities; by this I mean there's very little feeling, emotion or even romantic involvement between characters save for something shallow between Marle and Crono. Compare this to Final Fantasy 3 which despite also having turn-based battles, FF3 had a better soundtrack, storyline, items and graphics. FF3 is also a year older and was made by the same folks at Square. Only in graphics is Chrono Trigger more relevant to Secret of Evermore; however, the boy and his dog still had more depth and character than any single character within Chrono Trigger.  BOTTOM LINE - Chrono Trigger's replay value doesn't come from the multiple endings the game has to offer or the handful of choices you can make to encounter those endings. Replay value is associated with forgetting how bad this game is and in trying to overlook all its many drawbacks. The terrible cover art on the box should've been the first warning.	-1
If this was a launch title for the Playstaion 1 than one could guarentee that the system would be in the garbage bin along with Atari Jaguar and Virtual Boy.  This game is so horrible and unplayable that it is an embarassment to fighting games.  I will go out on a limb and say that this is the single worst fighting game I have ever played. The idea behind this game is that there are a cast of Dragon BAll GT characters all fighting it out.  There is no plot to speak of in this game and for most (outside of super obsessed fans who know extreme details of every character)they would out this game shortly after the first fight or two. This comes down to my biggest complaint about this game, the controls.  With any video game you need to have responsive controls.  You don't get that here.  There is no combo system to speak of which even early fighting games held (although did not go acknowledge).  Here is the idea of a typical fight on easy.  1:Fight Begins 2: You move forward to attack in which you move painfully slow 3: You hit kick, ten seconds pass and your character does the move 4: Your opponent is hit and fights back 5: Using the dash button you slowly move out of the way 6: You go to use a special (which seems to be insta kill), only to have it countered and you lose 7: Controller then shatters on TV screen in utter frustration.  This is an example of a fight that lasts possible a minute. Like I said the controls are the worst I have ever seen. I feel sorry for those who shell out X amount of dollars on this garbage and I challenge any one out there to give some reason at why this game is supposivly good.  Grand THeft Auto 2 has passed it's mantle as worst game of all time to this game, this is no buried treasure, this is no lost artifact or holy grail, this game is plain and simple garbage.	-1
Bart's Nightmare is a REAL nightmare.  The game stinks, plain and simple.  It shouldn't come as a surprise because back when the Simpsons were a brand new show NOTHING but crappy Simpson games were being released for the Genesis, Super NES, and regular NES.  Skipping this game means you are skipping a big nightmare.	-1
Controllers left trigger was broken had to replace it.	-1
Did not work for my son's game cube!!! He was so sad	-1
Broke after one week and was very dirty and stained wince it came in the mail with teirs on the wire causing the breaking of the controller	-1
I got a fake one sent to me and had to return it. The controller itself is 5 stars if you get an actual original one, but I didn't unfortunately and had to purchase one elsewhere.	-1
decent attempt at a knock off, but its bootleg as hell. they should be selling these with crack so you can get something worth the money being spent.	-1
This star raiding has nothing to do with the game being bad.  The disc I ordered had a cracked center so it doesn't play properly.	-1
came broken don't order	-1
I bought this so I can play some retro SNES games...the controller stopped working completely after a month.  Not sure what to make of that...It was a used controller, so I imagine something was wrong with it to begin with so this is really on the seller	-1
I got this when i dug my snes out and started playing it. But when i wanted to play super mario world on multiplayer i could not find the second controller. I looked everywhere. Anyway when i bought this one it looked great. But it was not. When u start to use it u notice that the cord is way shorter than the original controller, it is not even the same as the other because it does not say snes on it it just says nintindo but that does not really matter, and the worst of all the buttons stick and they r really stiff and hard to use. So now when u play multiplayer u r not even close to as good as u r with the original. Save ur money and buy the original one.	-1
Street Fighter II was a crappy fighting game that was completley unplayable. The gameplay is awful and the cartoon graphics just made it even worse. Mortal Kombat had it ALL OVER Street Fighter II in ALL of these areas. Mortal Kombat really shines in the graphics compared to this heap of crap. Playing as realistic digitized characters was just so much better than playing with animated cartoonie looking dorks like Ryu or Ken. Pass this up and get Mortal Kombat instead. I know Mortal Kombat 1 for SNES did not have the blood and gore,but it was and STILL is better than this. Bottom line is...ALL Street Fighter games suck and Mortal Kombat is better in EVERY WAY...MK ALL THE WAY!	-1
I had doubts buying a game pad from sellers stating this and i was right.  Be aware of sellers using something like this for a description. "BRAND NEW IN BOX!  *****NOTICE**** CONTROLLERS HAVE THE OFFICAL NINTENDO SEAL OF QUALITY BUT OUR NOT MADE BY NINTENDO ANY MORE. (IT IS THE ONE PICTURED ABOVE)"  I ordered one of these and........ 1. Cable was torn. 2. Packaged was not sealed and looks like the box was just reused to repackage extremely cheap knockoffs. 3. Cord is only around 4 feet. 4. The button labeling is a soft rubber sticker.  I honestly cant believe nintendo seriously licensed the game pad rights to  a company that would create such a cheap thing. Your better off buying a used pad,other than risk getting ripped off.	-1
I ordered 2 of these cables for a new retro game setup and only 1 of them worked. From a quality standpoint these cords are absolute crap. I have my old original n 64 video cable and it has normal gold pin connectors in it these new cords if you shine a flashlight into the connection end you might see 1 pin. Just a horrible design , I don't recommend these to anyone try to get original nes cords for your nintendo console. Amazon thanks for the professionalism getting these delivered to my house. To bad company's benefit on selling junk.	-1
First set did not work at all, seller sent out another set right away and it worked for 5 days..after waiting about 5 years to play my super Nintendo again I was highly disappointed. .	-1
This game is based on a futuristic game show, where rather than answering questions, contestants must enter an arena armed with a gun and face off against millions of club swinging minions, tanks, mutants and snakes, collecting cash, prizes (toasters, cars, VCRs), power-ups (orbs that shoot, force fields, razorblades that rotate), better weapons (grenades, spread lasers, rockets) and extra lives. You start in a television studio and must work your way through several rooms until you find the boss of the level. You can't just run from room to room either, you must defeat every single enemy that comes pouring into the room to shoot you, stab you, bite you, kill you, club you and run you over. There are literally 1000s of enemies per room making this game is probably one of the most impossible games ever! Before you get excited about this game, you view an overhead perspective of the room you are in, rather than a 1st person perspective. A nice feature of this game is with the SNES is that you use the buttons to shoot north (X), west (Y), south (B) and east (A) while your player runs in a different direction than you are shooting. This is also a very nice two player simultaneous game, for either competing against friends or teaming up with them. If you love intensity, impossible odds, shooting through never ending waves of enemies this is a great game! Thankfully the game came to SNES, people could have put $100 of quarters into the arcade game!	-1
The console description read "USED - GOOD" and also "Works Perfectly" well this was a total disappointment. The console arrived in terrible shape it was broken at the bottom piece, totally warped. It was missing the power plug at the console itself so there is absolutely no way to even test it. Not only that but the power brick was also damaged and it appeared to have gone through some sort of short circuit. The plastic was all warped as if it had been in some fire. Total waste of time and money.	-1
Once I open the packing box I found that the product was broken the case busted and it does not work.	-1
Yeah its not nintendo.	-1
I bought this game for my son and its not very fun, even for super nintendo. Too hard to get anywhere without cheating	-1
This is not a kirby game. It is another puzzle game like tetris but not as fun. It is exactly like a game i have on my computer called "candy crisis".... But kirby charecters unstead of candy falling down. What u do is match the objects up and try not to over flow the placement. It gives u two different objects at once and u make sure u match the things falling up to what is on the ground which u can move them over or turn them in different directions to match them. I like the original kirby on the nes so i tried this one and its just a puzzle game. I like all of the other kirby games better because they have a story.	-1
this game is so boring, don't get confused this is nothing like the other kirby games. It's in the style of tetris. and it gives tetris a bad name. This was a disapointment.  If you liked this game check out all of the other kirby games	-1
The Super nes  was rough looking  but that was expected  considering it age but worked as described it was missing the dustcover on the game slot and I could never get it to come in clear on my TV it always has lines in it but I don't blame the seller because you never know what you're going to get with these old  systems they we're all played so much back in the day The controller was a  knock off controller it would work for a minute and then short out  so I had to search for a official Nintendo controller on Amazon and it worked fine. But something was up with the system because I bought three sets of hook up wires and still couldn't get it come in clear on my plasma screen	-1
Lufia 2 rise the sinistral is the epitome of the mediocrity, no matter what's the legion of fanboy snes rpg tell you. It's avarage. The puzzle-oriented dungeon design is the strong point of the game.  The positive  - great use of puzzles in the dungeons - capsule - always escape - no casual encounters ( only world map) - dungeons are fun! - good extra - love story  The negative  - terrible storyline, simple and cliched plot, really a disappointment - stereotyped characters - the game don't aged very well - the gameplay is a bit monotonous - ugly and repetitive graphics (it's a 1996 game and secret of mana, release in 1993 has much better graphics!!) - mediocre soundtrack - poor presentation - easy near the end  graphics 5/10 soundtrack 7/10 story 4/10 characters 4/10 gameplay 9/10 fun factor 9/10  Miscellaneous lenght : a 40 hours game difficulty : easy near the end, but despite this is good replay value : avarage, good amount of extra	-1
It was all yellow I did not want that one	-1
Product doesn't work, Do not waste your money here.  The cables are thin and none of my 3 super nintendos work with this cable.	-1
I needed the cord with the little single cable outlet to put in the back of my TV. Not red yellow and white cables.	-1
the cable rattled when i first recieved it and didn't work so i cant really give a good review m	-1
I remember this game being fun. I recently bought it and its very confusing and a hard game to beat. Its fun at first, but then they add a stupid hang gliding test that just sucks. The game is tough and if you're into a challenge where you have to go though rings for points and land successfully this is it for you. You have to use differentiate speeds and elevations for certain levels. I would have to say this game is similar to Star Fox but I don't remember Star Fox being hard to play.	-1
i am a very critical person but when it comes to disney games i do my best to avoid them but this disney game was really creepy my friend brought it over one time and let me tell you its really bad i recommend goof troop to a disney fan	-1
I was reading through some of the glowing reviews for this and I still can't believe that no one has called this game for what it is, a Turkey! The fighting system is garbage. The graphics where ugly. The play controls are so awful it makes me wispful for Pit Fighter. There are cameos from Final Fantasy 7 that you can unlock, if thats your thing. If you are like most people who enjoy a good fighting game for what it is, I promise you will not be too moved by this novelty. You may care even less if you hated Final Fantasy 7, like myself. I would compare this fighting game license title to LucasArts Star Wars: Masters of Ter&auml;s K&auml;si. If you are a fan boy who gobbles up everything Square pooped out in the last 20 years and called it candy, then this is for you. You probably didn't read my review and already purchased this game along with a Tifa body Pillow. I would like to close with the inescapable truth that Capcom can make good RPG's but Square cannot make good fighting games, deal with it!	-1
I got this game expecting a lot.  I was very disappointed.  But first the good.  The game is innovative, being a departure from the standard RPG by Squaresoft.  The battle system was a good attempt, but didn't work too  well.  The cinematic features of the game were not disappointing.  The cut  scenes were wonderful and the overall graphics were pretty good.  The  storyline was interesting as well. Unfortunately, that did not make up  for the confusing nature of the game.  The weapon modification system did  not work well, and as I said before, the battle system did not end up being  as good as it could have been.  The gameplay was not immensely fun  either. Call it my opinion, but I did not enjoy this game at all and  couldn't wait to trade it in.	-1
all the Disc's wasn't there	-1
This is basically a chicks game, with toned down action, and horror themes designed to appeal to girls fears, most guys won't like it. More basically it's a failed experiment in game design. They had an interesting problem here with figuring out how to blend two contradictory game models: rpg vs survival horror, or leveling vs running away... But it doesn't work. The only thing interesting to me, in concept not execution, are the battle and weapon upgrade systems. The battle system mixes real time evasion with rpg atb, the problems are: enemies too fast, mostly undodgeable area attacks, slow character and enemies cast a slow spell to make you slower,and there's no room to move in the field. The weapon system has it's own problem with annoying penalties, and inconveniences. There are serious problems with pacing and story development, cutscenes vs playtime, and level design. The writers think that techno babble is story when it's just a plot device. The are parts in the game when you'll watch/read 15 minutes of cutscene, go do something boring that takes 5 minutes(like pressing against a box tapping x trying to get it to open) and then watch/read 20 minutes of cutscenes. The difficulty of the game is annoying, it's mostly designed to move you along like a movie but then will drop in cheap insta kill attacks. A lot of the rooms are empty except for graphic decoration, there is no dramatic action, plot element, or puzzle to solve, and exist only to hold a key to the room next door. Monsters infinitely respawn at doorways, and there's no way to pass but to fight them again. The monster design ranges from silly and lame like random placement of arms and legs, down to embarrassing like the final boss, who has a giant peepee for a tail, and a n-t sack hanging off his -ss. For most of the game you'll hear the same two song: overworld arpeggio, and battle theme. Camera angles suck. I could go on critisizing but it's tedious. This game is obsolete and only of interest for game design students.	-1
To anyone who is trying to play this game today, I just want to say that I played this under optimal conditions (Christmas break, 1998) at the height of my PS1 gaming power...and this game was extremely, extraordinarly mediocre. I know that a lot of people are falling over themselves to play the sequel, but you have to ask yourself, if a sausage factory like Square has waited over 10 years to make a sequel to one of their most (at the time) expensive franchises...was it really all that great? The game had a few good perks to it (customizable weapons, beautiful CG cutscenes, a pretty unique storyline for an RPG at the time), but if you play it without the rose colored glasses of nostalgia and collectibility, you will find an utterly mediocre gaming experience. I beat the game from start to finish, and at the end of it I could only say "I spent 30 hours of my life on this?!?" I gave it 2 stars mostly because it was a risk on Square's part to break away from the successful Final Fantasy/sci-fi settings, which is commendable in itself, and I had approximately 2-3 hours of enjoyment out of it, but if you're seriously looking to spend $180 on this game, it's not worth it!	-1
I own Saga Frontier one and it isn't as bad this is.  Why can't these SaGa Frontier games be good?  I thought that this game would be different.  No longer competely non-linear gameplay.  There is a story that is very evident how who are supposed to follow it.  Not like Saga Frontier where you could wander around for three hours and still not know what you wher doing.  The battle system reminded me of old Game Boy games.  You can only use this weapon 50 times and the attacks are incredibly weak quick whack the enemy again.  I'm sorry but I am a firm believer that weapons shouldn't have a fixed usage to them.  I believe that they should break on a rare occasion but they shouldn't have fixed number of times to use.  The story goes between two characters that you choose which one to follow.  At least they took a better stab at making a better story for the characters than they did last time.  The battle system is also very complex.  There are three types and sometimes it really confuses the player as to the differences between the three (and there are differences).  The game's music has never been a strong point.  I didn't care for it at all.  Some of it was really good the rest sounded really bad.  The graphics are beautiful though.  They look very similar to those in Legend of Mana (same artists I think) and they will bowl you over.  If you like graphics and don't care about anything else with a game enjoy.  Otherwise don't waste your money.	-1
Basically a Beta for StarFox 64	-1
I heard SO many good things and how legendary this game was, I bought it, and Wanted a refund.  The framerate is SO BAD that its like watching a slideshow. Virtua racer on the genesis is SO much better then this.  and the controls..... HOHOHOHO  You go way too fast, and the controls are SO SLUGGISH. I played at least 45 minutes and trained, but I couldn't do good enough, I keep crashing. IDK Y nintendo thought there console was so cutting edge that they tried to make it do 3D polygons, but it fails. leave that up to the PS1 and Sega Saturn.	-1
Now when I first played this game, I loved it!  But after awhile of playing I came to this one boss that I have spent a month on and havn't been able to beat!  And it's not cause I'm not good at fighting, it's because whenever he hurt's you, his life bar refuals to whatever amount he hurt you for TIMES TWO!!!  So if he takes away 22 health points from you, then he will gain 44 health points from you!!!  What!?!  And because I can't get any more health than 96 it makes it so I'm at a MAJOR dissadvantage!  And for the record 7/10 that I attack him I miss, even with the special attacks (Every one knows that special attacks shouldn't miss.  Other wise that makes it a regular move that just costs something more than a special attack!)!?!  Now that's unfair.  Now I'm not saying the game is bad because I was really enjoying this game up to this point!  But now I feel forced to buy a hint book or I may never beat this guy.  Shame on the creators for making such an unfair boss!  I feel like I was robbed of my money for this game.	-1
How anyone can give this title a solid 5stars is beyond me.  This title is by far the worst RPG game ever created!!!  "Time Stalkers" is everything gone wrong with an RPG, which had the potential of being a great title, if just a little more time and effort were put into the project.  Dungeons are randomly picked, (which can be an either good or bad thing dependings on one's preference) can only carry 5 items when entering a dungeon (only level 1 weapons can be carried inside a dungeon since your character is started at level even time they enter a new) , and worst of all if you're defeated in a battle guess what, not only do have to start the entire dungeon from scratch, but you're also started back at level 1 and lose all of strong weapons which you had gathered during your voyage!!  What were the creaters thinking?!!  Not only that, but the list goes on and on!!  Do not buy this title!!  I'll make you want to play NES rpg titles!!!  Which are better may I add, than this title!!	-1
good idea bad try.nobody well come to ur town.none simciy games r playable	-1
this game is boring and all you do is build very boring buildings with no detail...you take 3 hours to build a city that is not even detail enough to see people or cars or anything going on!...	-1
This must be better as a PC game. Now I see why it was so cheap. The controls and maneuvering are so ridiculously difficult to learn and master. And the game has no tutorial or any way to learn what all the little squares and whatnot mean. I spent over an hour trying to figure it out on my own and couldn't so I put it down and never picked it back up. I hear the one for the PC is a real classic and very enjoyable though!	-1
RPGs are my favorite genre.  Especially action ones, which are few and far between.  I was hoping this would be another "Zelda" or "Alundra" with better graphics.  But it was simply annoying.  I cringed the first time I heard Musashi's HORRID voice, and every other time I heard it.  Big disappointment.  The game was promoted as an RPG, but it doesn't remind me of an RPG.  It's an annoying adventure game with annoying voice acting.  The "hero" looks and sounds like a bratty ten year old. Definitely not for everyone, especially someone expecting a typical RPG.  Don't disappoint yourself like I did.  This is the first time I ever returned a game, in the same night to boot! Rent it first!	-1
I am a professional gamer and this is the hardest game  i have ever played, not only that, but there is rarely any action to it, so don't let the beginning fool you, this game is worth it if you are professional, i beat it, but not very many people have, ... the worst buy i have ever bought, so don't get it unless it's cheap	-1
horrible graphics, bad controls, annoying guy in your ear saying "no tangos in site"  It took me about 30 minutes to beat on the hard difficulty level.  I bought it back when it cost 70 bucks, plus i thought i had to buy a control pack to save a game.  You don't need to save a game, because if you cant beat it in one sitting  you shouldnt be play video games.  Go out and buy a ps2 and play some real games (n64 is dead)	-1
Now I'm not saying that the Rainbow 6 for PC is bad. The PC game is the best. The Playstation version is the sooooo bad. You go around in first person view. But unlike the PC game you you get a DOOM of Goldeneye type view with the gun on you screen. Some of the levels were changed. It is almost impossible to aim you gun. And there is no planning screen all you do is choose who gos and where they go in. If you played or own the PC or N64 Verson (the N64 wasn't good eather, but it was better) you will be disapointed. It is really a totally different game. I give it one thumb up and one thumb down.	-1
this controller is really a bad idea on segas part, the six button is much more user friendly especially to anyone who enjoys fighting games (such as myself) given i do own a pair of these, i never use them, use my six buttons even on three button compatable games because the only difference is you don't use the x y z buttons lol, plus on any six button genre games that incorporated the using start button to swap the threes functions you loose the pause feature, defanatly not the best controller for the genesis	-1
I recieved the controller on time, how ever it is not fully functional, only the directional key works, and the start button works from time to time, the other three buttons are not working at all. probaly should have gone with a replica, however i'll give it another shot and order another form another Amazon supplier.. Good luck to us all who put our money and faith into second hand material.	-1
This game has seen its life. It lacks the motivation and breath-taking function of others of its genre here on 2009. I find Clocktower for the SNES to be more entertaining.  -The graphics-  Fuzzy character sprites, blood that is so cheap that it looks like red paint? Resident Evil took a whipping in the visual department. The zombies look like Re-Deads. And a brownish/black fuzzy blob is not scary, it's funny. There's been games like Tomb Raider and Croc that visually look better yet they are both PS1 games.  Like a Sweet Home spinoff, Resident Evil starts out with very little weapons, but with scarce ammo. The one major difference between these two however, are the controls.  That's right, i'm talking about button-busting control schemes. All the earlier RE games have an annoying tendency of allowing the character to die, a lot. When other games came out (and before) the controls were smoother, RE insisted that the characters turn painfully slow away from an approaching zombie, just giving the zombie enough ample-time to latch on to have lunch, breakfast, and dinner.  Now what's so scary about this game?  Is it given that M-ratings were considered 'rare' back on the PS1? The script? Or 'knowing' some zombie is gonna come out of that hallway sooner or later? The game starts with the player arriving on the grounds of the mansion (in a grainy video) then inside. Immediately there is conversation. The voice-acting is dull, un-lively and boring. Do I care that there's blood on the floor? No, why? because it looks like paint, that's why! Don't mind the plain-in-sight dead-body laying in the corner there, it's decor! Or not. Again, the voice-acting is as bland and convincing as a monologue broken-record. Ahh. Something's there. Ahhhhh. Bad acting produces bad results.  Given that it was the first RE game may be the reason for its praising, considering both it's puzzle-like feature of finding items/unlocking rooms and of course, the zombies in a squashed polygon-rendered environment. But by today's standards (Fallout 3 anyone?) this game simply doesn't cut it. Silent Hill has a remake of it's first game, it may be worth a try. But as for RE 1 original, it's a rent. Try the other games before considering this.	-1
Unimaginative, and not even good in comparison to other "kart" games. The game is highly focused on picking up magic crystals on the track and using them against opponents -- for example, getting three  "fire" crystals hits *all* opponents with an unavoidable fire  attack. And, frankly, what fun is that?  You race well enough to take the  lead, only to get hit with a cheap shot?  There's certainly no place for  such anti-rewards in a game aimed at anyone over the age of five, and those  younger won't be able to handle the twisty tracks anyways. Breeding and  raising Chocobos in "Final Fantasy VII" was fun.  Racing them  around in mario-karts most certainly is not.	-1
I chose this rating because it was an audio CD and I was ripped off. I dislike this. I would not recommend to anyone.	-1
Game came in and was scratched beyond belief. You can dowload of psn for cheaper.	-1
From what people make this game out to be, it was supposed to be the "best game of all time" perhaps, but I saw it completely different. I dunno if it is just me, but I found this games storyline incredibly boring, the battle system was OK in some areas, and the music was absolutely dreadful. Let me break it down for you.... Music: 1/5... Why? Because it repeats the same tunes over...and over...and OVER AGAIN. The reason I gave it one star, is because when you first hear the music it sounds good, but after hearing it in so many areas throughout the game, its tedious and very annoying. And when it comes down to it I wasn't very satisfied with the music to begin with. Like for example, most of the areas in the game will play the same exact music, so it gets very repetitive. Storyline: 2/5 I found the storyline pretty horrific as far as being interesting and captivating. Not once in the game did I really care about the characters or what was really going on. And there is so much talking in this game I could probably fall asleep after drinking 10 glasses of cafe mocha...To be blunt...there is way too much talking...and the story isn't explained till the end. So throughout the whole game you are confused about what the heck is going on. Entertainment- 3/5 Why am i giving it a decent score for entertainment? Well there are a lot of interesting mini games here and playing in the xenogears mixed with humans is also interesting. Playability- 4/5 This is probably the only good part about this game. You can actually jump around here (unlike most RPGs) and there is plenty to explore in your environment. This sometimes makes traveling through long boring dungeons...not so dull. Graphics- 3.5/5 The graphics are alright, not good enough to give four stars, but pretty good for when it came out. I am a sucker for 3d playstation one style graphics...kinda the old-school style that playstation RPGs used to have. If you are looking for final fantasy 8 graphics....you won't find them here. Overall- 2.5/5 If you have a lot of time on your hands...or like playing games for extended periods of time...this is for you. I however, do not enjoy playing games for 80 hours just to see the ending. Yes thats right...80 + hours just to finish it off, not including finishing everything such as side quests...just the storyline. How someone can sit through 80 hours of jabbering and a boring storyline...and let's not forget annoying music...I have no idea. I hope some day I will understand why this game is considered to be so great...but I don't think it will happen. Do i recommend this? Nope.	-1
This game sucks. The game play is bad, the graphics are bad, the game is all around bad. You don't want to play this game. Find another one.	-1
I loved the Sim Theme Park game on PC, and when my brother got a PS1 for his birthday I went right out and bought the Sim Theme Park for Playstation1. Well, I was dissapointed. The graphics have been reduced greatly. It is also difficult to create a park (in my opinion), and the it takes a while for our version to load. However, there may be a scratch or so on it, since I did get it used (I am cheap lol). However, most Playstation 1 games have lower graphics so, it isn't that bad. But honestly, I like the PC version much better than the PS1 version. Pros: 1) Fun creating your own theme park 2) The great PC game comes to PS1! Cons: 1) PC version better 2) Low graphics 3) Controls are difficult	-1
High Stakes is definately a better game... If you enjoy being a cop against the computer, then go for this one.. if your thinking of becoming a speed demon then go for this. I also recomend renting it first.. graphics / sound suck.	-1
A game where you play as a trainer and command Pokmon to fight other trainers, sounds awesome right? Pokmon Stadium is possibly one of the worst Nintendo games I have ever played. Now, when I was a kid it was really fun to do the free for all mode and chose the best Pokmon the game had to offer, but after you played that a few times it was time to shut off the Nintendo and plug in another game. There is no main story to keep you involved, its only tournaments after tournaments. In retrospect, the idea of a Pokmon battle game sounds amazing, but if you thought it was going to be anything like the hit Pokmon games on the Gameboy your surely mistaken. The one thing this game had going for itself was its stunning graphics. Pokmon Stadium used the Nintendo 64 to its full use on detail in this game, but the soundboard on the game can get slightly tedious and annoying. With an announcer restating every move you just made over the loudspeaker, it makes you want to play the game with the sounds off, and if your going to play it with the sound off you might as well not play it at all.  Overall I give this game a 2 out of 5. It has great graphics, but the game couldn't seem to pinpoint the certain aspects of a Pokmon game that its players love; the story and the adventure side.	-1
I may not be a Pokemon fan anymore, but I LOVED the series when I was a lot younger (Fun Fact: A Jirachi card was what motivated me to ride my bike). Actually, I'd probably go play Pokemon Sapphire again if I were to come back to Pokemon fandom. Now, let me tell you: I'm not one to troll Nintendo. I'm a HUGE Nintendo fanboy, just so you know (See lots of my other reviews for proof).  But then when you look at Pokemon Stadium, you'd probably think: "OMG POKEMON ON NINTENDO 64!!!" It would be one of the best Nintendo games ever, considering how awesome the series was on Game Boy, right? WRONG.  Pokemon Stadium isn't what you'd expect to be the next big entry in the franchise. Rather than it being an RPG, the series's turn-based battles replace it all! It's all about fighting your Pokemon. Nothing else. In turned-based battles. How the heck is that supposed to work? It's not. If it's an RPG with that stuff, then we'd be all over it. You CAN'T have the turn-based battles make up a whole game by itself.  Okay, maybe it actually isn't ALL about the turn-based battles. There are minigames, and some of them can be rather interesting. But they only remind you that this should have been an RPG. We had to wait for Pokemon Colosseum to give us the experience that we really needed. This should be left alone, as one of Nintendo's few pieces of crap. At least the graphics were amazing for the N64.	-1
The only reason this got two stars were the mini games which aren't near the quality of Mario Party games or pretty much anything else. What this game is is the annoying random battles from RPGs without the fun magic systems, plotlines, or general gameplay. Transfer pak adds nothing to the replay value and will be worthless on the n64, avoid.	-1
Is it me or is this game really boring, repetitive commentary, pointless competitions, no advancement for beginners to masters, and even the "fun" little party games are quick and boring. There are several parts to the game, the challenge road where you go through six Pokemon categories each getting more difficult. There is the freestyle where you battle against other Pokemasters or your friends. There are even nine party games which get old very fast. You are supposed to use your own Pokemon from your Gameboy pack, but there is a way to cheat by using the rental Pokemon which comes with all 150 Pokemon (instead of having to earn them). Even children get bored quickly of the game. There is a good part to the Pokemon Stadium package, it comes with a piece of hardware that lets you play your Gameboy on the N64. This also is not a RPG like the Pokemon Gameboy games are.	-1
This game is boring because it's all the same. If you get a different pokemon, it doesnt matter. you do the same thing over and over. You attack and beat and attack and beat. It's too easy too. I thought Pokemon Snap was MUCH better! That game was one of my favorites. This game just has no point. Fighting is the only thing you do. I mean the gameboy pokemon was better than this one! You get to go on an adventure and find things and get items! That was fun. This is fighting ONLY. Boring! If you want a good pokemon game get any of them for gameboy including Yellow, Blue, Red, Gold, Silver. Or even better, get pokemon snap!	-1
This one doesn't work	-1
the transfer pak only works on a limited number of games and u won't use it a lot unless u have pokemon stadium or perfect dark.  if u have those games and hvae game boy versions of them, buy this. If u don't theres not a real reason to buy this if u don't own those games.	-1
This pak is basically only for the Pokemon Stadium game, which is quite fun for me, since I love the strategy of Pokemon. Anyway, I got this and did not know that Pokemon Gold did not work with Pokemon Stadium (1) and I also discovered that you cannot mix and match Pokemon. For example, load one pokemon into the game and then rent pokemon of that type. Maybe I am not very experienced with this, or did not read up on the product more. However, if you can get it for a low price it is interesting. But, it hasn't worked for me since I lost my Pokemon Red game... Pros: 1) You can add more pokemon that you cannot rent 2) You can play the gameboy version 3) It is a low price (especially when you get it used) Cons: 1) Not enough games that work for it 2) Simply, not really much point	-1
At first Mario Party 2 seems like one of the best games. Don't get tricked. After a while, Mario Party 2, will be the most boring thing ever. The minigames will get old and it just won't be fun. The multiplayer mode is good for partys but even then will get lame. This is a rental only.	-1
Not good.	-1
The controls in this game are confusing, because you can't tell what the messages or options mean.  However, if you want to play this kind of game, I recommend reading the instruction manual daily.  Why?  Because the rules are completely forgettable.  Otherwise, this game may not be worth playing, unless you have a partner to help you play it.	-1
Pick people up and drive them through an impressively rendered city to a limited number of destinations. Along the way you can chase people off the sidewalk, bang into cars, dodge traffic and even drive across the bottom of the ocean, but so what? You can't shift except to put it in forward and reverse. The car acts as though the wheels were under the center. There's no power sliding around corners. People always get out of the way on time. Some of the roll overs look realistic, but there's no real damage. You almost never get up to speed as there are so many obstacles and sharp turns. The cars all handle about the same. This is the kind of feel good game. It all takes place on a bright summer day. The convertible taxi's go bombing around with their tops down, but I get a little stressed with all the rush rush and the traffic. I just don't feel like this is that much fun. It's stressful and tedious. People say this is a racing game, but it really isn't. It's a driving game, sort of a fake driving game and I think it's best suited for an arcade where the glitzy graphics can pull people in for a couple of rides and then let them get on with their lives. Playing it for more than a few minutes just shows you how little it has to offer. I don't think they even have different views and I'm sick of this town, San Francisco. If you want a decent racing game, get Need for Speed for PSX or even Ridge Racer. At least RR had powerslides. Oh yeah. The music sucks and the chatter gets old even faster than the game.	-1
Once you play the first scene, all others are the same. You have the same type of customers and the same moves within the cities. I got bored after 30 minutes of play. The only highlight of the game were the soundtrack from hit bands, The Offsprings and Bad Religion. One of the bad games Sega had made.	-1
In my book, [this] is a major investment for any "game", so when you plunk down that much green, you'd better end up green with envy that you weren't the one responsible for designing such  an amazing product.  In the case of Gunship! you'll see plenty of green but  only in the form of the aircraft, the ground, the trees (did I mention the  ground?) and loads of lifeless buildings stacked together like some  survivalist compound.  The excitement in Gunship! hardly went further than  the slick graphics and screen shots on the box.  As for performance, the  play of this title is just plain... plain, sort of like Cream of Wheat if  you don't cook it with a pinch of salt, all the sugar in the world won't  help, and it doesn't help Gunship! So to avoid that familiar dull sinking  feeling you get in your gut and your wallet because you've been lured once  again into the cold murky depths by the Sirens Song (i.e. slick packaging),  wait until it goes on sale or you can get it in your local second-time  around software store for [less]...	-1
I was really desprite to get this game because I wanted ahelicopter Gunship game.  I had Commanche Gold but that was good for beginers. I wanted something more advanced.  I bought this. Here is my two cents.  This game was terrible. DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYONE SAYING IT IS GOOD.  If you really want a good Attack helicopter game get "Eenemy Engaged: RAH-66 Commanche vs. Ka-52 Hokum B: Aligator" Long name but good game.  Now back to Gunship.  As everyone said the waypoont system just plain doesn't work, you have to go through a whole menu system and it only worked for me during the demo.  The CP/G is a usless jerk who never does anything you say.  And if you play as the CP/G the pilot always gets you killed.  Firing a missile at the target YOU want is nearly impossible and for [the price] this is just a real rip off. So in a summary all I can say is don't buy this buy somethiung else...	-1
This is not a game it is a completely computer rendered movie with good Dialogue decent story and wonderful music.  The problem is I play video games to play and this title lacks gameplay in a woeful manner.  You switch modes so there is some upclose gun battles alot of em in fact thats all the gameplay really consists of besides wandering around.  The hunting mode is fun for about ten minutes until you master it.  I would buy this game for under  twenty bucks and be happy with the entertainment value I got from the FMV's and the soundtrack both of which are incredible.  If you are looking for a scary little movie that you push along you might just like it but rent first.	-1
D2 has it's moments but for the most part this game is just plain boring.  The graphics are stellar, the cinematics were well done and the controls  are pretty easy to learn, but when it comes to actual gameplay, there is a  lack there of.  The game consists of four discs of little more then  repetive cgi movies.  You control a women who never speeks on camera but  supposidly does off.  You are forced to trek back and forth to the same  spots over and over again killing the same monsters in the same spots the  same way each time.  90% of the time you will have no control of what is  going on and just sit back and watch.  And for every little thing your  character does, open doors, pick up an item and so on, you are forced to  watch a quick cut scene, Everytime.  It gets very old very fast.  For those  who actualy like to play games rather then look over your friends shoulder  and watch, look elsewhere.  Don't even bother with this coaster.	-1
This is the so called "Better version" of pokemon blue and Red. The only thing that's better is that you can get Charmander , Squitle , and bulbasaur. the graphics chanmged a little bit and Pikachu is the only pokemon that cries it's name!!! Why is that? But Pikachu learns new atyttacks like: Dulble team at Lv. 15. It raises your Envade. Slam at Lv 20 . A normal phsical attack . and Thunderbolt at Lv. 26. Pikachu is your starting pokemon. But It can't evovle. Raichu like kicks ass. Raichu has one attack Pikachu doesn't, Mega Punch. for people that don't know this but sometimes you nmeed to make some of your pokemon to elvove to mlearn new moves.	-1
If you have a Gameshark, get this game. I thought it would be easy, but now I need a Gameshark. I named my Pikachu Rocky and it only says "Pika" on Stadium. If you're good at Stadium, you could get this game too. Get if you can beat Red and Blue without cheating. That is what Yellow is like without a GameShark. I can't even pass Celadon City because Pikachu is so scared.	-1
I hate simulation racing games, so when one day I decided to rent Ridge Racer 64, I wasn't expecting anything good. Wow, what a surprise. It got  boring after about ten or fifteen minutes, there are only three tracks in  all, which is horrible for a racing game. Save your money, buy F-Zero X,  Mario Kart 64, or Diddy Kong. Don't even bother thiking or even renting  this turkey.	-1
I loved Fallout 3 and mostly enjoyed Fallout: New Vegas, so I decided to give one of the older games a try and was pretty let down. The main problem with the game is that it's very unresponsive. Things occur so slowly that you cant be sure whether or not the game has even registered that you did an action or not. If you're dying to play this game and are willing to put in the time it takes to deal with the finicky controls then you may enjoy yourself, but those looking for a quick fallout fix should just check out fallout's great wiki.	-1
It is difficult to stand against the onslaught of love and respect for this game. And I'm not saying don't try this game. Too many people loved it for me to expect you to go by my experience, but I do want to share with you my different perspective.  First off, looking back, I don't hate Baldur's gate. It has it's virtues. Its just that after 20 or so hours it began to weigh on me, leaving me with a feeling heavy, bleak, and insistent.  In taking up computer games as a hobby a year ago it was one of the first games I played or really got into.  Fascination rolled into addiction and addiction rolled into a kind of dread and tedium.  Finally I realized I didn't actually have to play this game anymore.  So I didn't.  This may seem like an obvious solution to you, but then you don't actually know me so well.  Enough preamble. I like to rate games based on categories that I find important to me and so I will do that below on a scale of say 1 to 10. How's that?  Story:  4,  I'll admit my predispositions here, and also that not actually getting more than a third of the way through this game limits me a little, but I do feel I got the main idea.  My predisposition is that I long for a computer game that is story driven effectively and actually works as a good story. Story is always such a distant second to gameplay that you end up with these half hour stories built into 15 to 60 hour games.  Generally they either make little sense, or fade into a weird sequel nothingness in the end (hello half life 2, beyond good and evil (good games both nevertheless)). I have tried so many, do actually like many games, but have been underwhelmed repeatedly as far as story.  Baldur's had the advantage that I was new to gaming and so hadn't seen all it's conventions before, even if they were familiar.  In this game you wake up in a prison cell and have a secret destiny.  Yeah yeah yeah.  It's actually not too bad though and the quality of some of the characters helps, but, and I think this might be the key problem, in order to create an open ended world, provide a variety of quests, and give the good/evil option as it were, the whole thing comes completely apart at the seams.  The story falls apart into ridiculousness except the game pretends it hasn't and you're supposed to too. Just to start you spend hours struggling to break out of a dungeon you have no knowledge of even though a member of your party broke in to get you.  Wouldn't she have some helpful information?  How did she manage it in the first place? So much of this game is full of stuff like this. Its been awhile so I'm fuzzy, but could come up with quite a few more examples, like places where the sense of what is good and effective to do in the game defies the reality of your characters as actual people.  In my opinion you can have a very linear game (problem is too few options as a player unless it's done perfectly), or a completely wide open, basically questless game (problem is it feels kind of pointless unless it's done perfectly and beautifully) or you can have a reality defying muddle in the middle of the two. Baldur's takes this last path I am afraid.  Still, I would have sort of liked to see how it all turned out if I didn't have to slog through so very much stuff and time to get to it.  Characters: 7 or 8,  very good.  Love the pictures. Voices excellent. Really nicely done, though after awhile hearing them say the same phrases hundreds of times was hard to take.  Also the story caused them to do things completely out of character at times.  Gameplay:  5,  I prefer less difficulty in games and would have appreciated a difficulty level system very much.  There is a lot of fighting, managing your stuff and fighting some more and its that d and d dice rolling fighting that can look very strange (big guy with huge sword swings at weakened creature just standing there and misses wildly). It often left me feeling faintly like it wasn't working and that the game didn't do what was in the queues for my characters even though I suppose it really was.  Graphics: 6,  nice general visual design and though its dated now its pretty powerful in the sense of mood it imparts (though see below). I mean it really did affect me in an almost dreamlike way for awhile.  It was a bit of a letdown in terms of giving me a sense of wonder though.  Dreariness factor:  1,  cold, chill and frequently joyless.  That's how I found it.  Some of the character humor helped a little, especially the nicer characters, but so much killing and grim characters and so little relief or oasis or real rewards or lightness in comparison. Plus I felt burdened by the way the quests could just sort of pile up on you and all be emergencies.  Technical issues:  I always feel this is so subjective as you never know what will be a problem with your computer, but a few small or weird glitches were really awful for me.  I couldn't get downstairs in one place, something crucial disappeared in another.  Learning factor:  4,  had a tutorial level which maybe I wouldn't find too confusing with the experience I have now in games, but I really wish it had been more clear and specific.  Product materials:  5,  a nice start, decent book, but really quite incomplete.  Chore factor:  2,  well, you know, so many rooms of so many monster things to really get anywhere.  I really did feel burdened.  Difficulty:  3,  kind of already discussed but I'll add that everything seemed either kind of hard to kill or quite hard to kill, it would have been nice and even appropriate if some things had been very easy too. I will repeat I might have lasted longer with an easy or moderately easy setting, but it still would've gotten to me in the end.  Game saves:  7,  a pretty good save anytime system only flawed by an inability to save in combat, which, if I recall, could sometimes sneak up on you and then it was too late.  Conclusion:  I find when I write negative reviews of really popular and respected games (gta vice city is a good example) people tend to say its not helpful, and if I like them its very helpful,  but sometimes I think they maybe already played the game and think it's some kind of contest these reviews (then of course, maybe they just think its not a very informative review).  I'm just telling you my reaction here and my thoughts. A lot of people gave this classic game 5 stars. I really think this game could've been alot better.  Baldur's gate made me think maybe I don't like rpgs too much, but I am currently pretty far along in star wars knights of the old republic and very much like it.	-1
Like many of the other previous reviewers, I bought the game because the demo was outstanding. I'm finding in practice that the game really doesn't measure up, however. To Ground Control's credit, this is probably the  best 3D land-based RTS game to come out yet. However, it still doesn't  manage to escape from a lot of the shortcomings of its fellow 3D  RTS's. The nature of 3D RTS, at least so far, seems to be that units are  more 'realistically' proportional to the terrain. While that may be nice on  paper, in gameplay what it translates to is that you spend hours moving  your units from one place on the map to the other, because they're so small  in proportion to the terrain. In fighting battles, you're obligated to zoom  out to such an extent that each unit is only a blip of a few pixels on your  screen--not much fun to watch or look at while directing the troops. I  don't find the elimination of resource management to be a plus for Ground  Control. What that ends up meaning is that there is no reinforcement  available for you to build or buy; you can't simply play and have fun if  you want to try different things in a mission. You have to carefully and  tediously position your units so as to incur as few losses as possible. Add  to this the fact that there is NO in-game saving in Ground Control, and you  find yourself playing very carefully and tediously indeed. Topping this  off, there just isn't a good story happening here to keep you interested.  It's mostly told through the thoughts of the two side commanders rather  than through good character and dialog. The cutscenes are hands-down the  worst I've ever seen--they are videos of the game engine, it looks like,  and they're so badly compressed that they look like they're being streamed  over the web--blocky, blurry, and awful to watch. On the positive side,  the game does look great, especially when you zoom in close to the units  fighting. It plays better on lower-end systems than other games of its  type, but you'll still need a blistering machine if you want to see it in  its full glory. Be warned also that it's not entirely stable. A patch was  released the day after it hit retail, but not all of the bugs are out of  it. One of the worst is that it will crash on completion of a mission, and  you don't get credited with the mission. I've spent more hours replaying  because of this than I'd care to admit. As a former Army officer, I think  there are some cool tactical things happening in Ground Control that  haven't been modeled well in other games--friendly fire, fire support,  formations--but in the end, when all is said and done, I have to say that  the game just isn't that much fun to play. You're getting 90% of the  experience in the demo. If it really floats your boat after seeing it, then  maybe you should try it. Other than that, buyer beware.	-1
Here is the deal people,  the game plot is good, very good, but it all rolls down hill from there.  First of all if you buy this game, save and save a lot (thank god for the quick save option), because you will, I repeat will experience crashes, any where from everyonce in a while to quite frequently.  You will also experience several glitches and bugs, some that will keep you from being able to kill the bad guy John Irenicus.  Don't rely on Interplay or Black Isle for help...... their idea of customer service is and always has been... release the game and leave the customer behind because once they buy it, we have our money.  The game got boring after a couple days of playing because it was basically the same stuff all the time, run into an NPC he/she has a problem, you go hack and slash your way through hordes of bad guys to solve it, no real problem solving involved.  They did very little to fix the AI from Baldurs Gate 1, but they did come up with "way points", that is if you feel like taking the time to lay them out AND know what is ahead of you through the Fog of War.  They boasted that the game was going to be more acceptable of 'Evil' characters, but it really isn't, all of your NPC's in your party will be mostly "lawful good or chaotic good" except for one Mage that you can get and the two druids who are nuetral (but they act more good than true nuetral)and Viconia, and they will leave you at the first sign of you "evil ways", that's right, you can't go clear whole city blocks of citizens and expect to have a party left with you.  Bottom line, the game is terrible, it seems like interplay rushed the game out about four of five months too soon.  Oh and if you have a problem at the final battle and can't seem to kill John Irenicus, find out wich party member isn't talking remove them from your party, and then ask them to rejoin, interplay made me find that out on my own, quality service I tell ya.	-1
Just when you thought it was safe to put off Baldurs Gate, here comes Icewind Dale.  A magnificent combination of BG and the older games in the gold box series.  Dungeon hacking and roleplaying at their best. In  Icewind Dale, you form an entire party of your Player Characters, compared  other BG engine games in which you were allowed one main player.  This  makes it more fun, allowing you to watch your adventurers progress one at a  time as they grow so much more powerful than they were when the game  began. Another added bonus is the addition of new spells and monsters.  The enemy AI is stronger, and the new monsters such as mind flayers will  provide enough fun and frustration to make this game a challenge for any  level player. Look out Diablo 2, Icewind Dale is a major contender to  knock you off the number one spot!  One error for Diable 2 and its gone,  because Icewind Dale is perfect.	-1
Fails. I've never played baldurs gate. I remember my sister asking to so I asked my dad to play Icewind Dale. He set this up for me and I remember playing to the Vale of Shadows. I stopped about half way through. The most ignorant part about the games is the battles. As you go they get increasingly frequent. I hate haveing to fight a skeleton with 2 hp every other second. As for fighting, the game lacks as it is more of a point and click. I started playing again from the middle of the Vale, and finally got out of there. I then went to a temple which was alright. After that I realized that I was going to another dungeon type cave. This time, I read a strategy guide to find out that it was about 5 levels of fighting. That's not fun. That is not fun at all. I could respect a short game with few battles, but when I fight battles every other minute just to drag out something... It almost seems meaningless after a while. Anyways, I stopped playing there and decided to remake my party earlier today. I am enjoying it more, mostly because I know to make really powerful fighters and forget about druids. My druid last game killed about 15 units. My main character killed about 300. This can only tell you that my druid was bad. Fortunately I was able to change him later in the game. Although when I did, I got stuck with a level 1 character who was easily killed off. So yea, don't think because you can change your party means you will be changing later in the game. The feature is useless because by the time you discover just how bad your fighter is, the game will be too hard for you to change. The game does a great job in voice actors though. The fact that I create my entire party is fine. The graphics could use some work. I get tired and bored of the same old dark environments every other minute. Even the snow seems depressing. Other than that, the game offers repetitive battles and little more. Online play isn't fun at all considering on gamespy there are usually one or 2 games going. Once you do get in the game you will learn that everyone exported characters who fought enemies on easy and had the option "max hp on level up" set. Here's some advice, go play baldurs gate. My sis, sister is playing it again. She is enjoying it. This game is bland, depressing, and repetitive. Sorry but don't get it unless you wanna blow 5 bucks.	-1
After reading all the excellent reviews for this game I thought I would give it a try. After many hours of trying to get myself to enjoy it I just gave up. Now, I know that this is an RPG game, but personally I find the pace of the game to be much to slow compared to some of the other RPG's that I've played in the past. Also, I highly recommend reading the manual before you play or you will be completely lost. I'm sure many of you out there like these challenging games, but I just thought I would give a different perspective about what to expect. Some aspects of the game I DID like are the graphics. Beautiful scenery and settings throughout the game, and some cool effects with certain characters as well. I also liked the opening cutscene. My advise is only buy this game if you are really into RPG's otherwise I would stay away.	-1
....  It's ... frustrating, too the point that it isn't fun.  I'm an avid gamer.  It's fun to "role-play" low level characters.  An orc or two can be a very scary thing.  This doesn't translate well to a computer game that wipes out an entire party in ten seconds even with the "AI" scripts on.  The visuals are cool, but I wish I would have plunked my money down for something else.  This game does not deliver.  Boring linear plot and hack-n-die.  Buy some dice, a figure and paper for a real roleplaying game.	-1
After playing DOA Ultimate for Xbox, people may be tempted to buy this version for Dreamcast. Don't bother, this version for Dreamcast is extremely boring. It has zero replay value. This game is garbage compared to the better Xbox versions.  Other Dreamcast games that are 100 times better: Virtua Fighter 3, Soul Calibur, and Project Justice. These 3 games are excellent and are only available on Dreamcast.	-1
DOA2 is a fun game to play with friends that can play it also.  First off the game has NO extras. That in itself is disappointing!  Secondly, the single player game [...] BIG time. As a result the team battles and versus battles with friends are all you will have to hang on to.  These 2 flaws really killed the game for me. I love extras and a good single player mode since I can't have friends over everyday.  On the plus side, the graphics are great and the gameplay is fun, espically with friends. I'll recommend this game as a good game to play with friends. If you don't have that option then you couls let it slip by.	-1
THIS WAS THE FIRST OF THE SMACKDOWN GAMES. WHILE IT WAS VERY FUN TO PLAY WHEN IT WAS FIRST RELEASED, THIS GAME IS ALMOST UNPLAYABLE TODAY! BEING THAT WE GOT MUCH FASTER GAMES LIKE SMACKDOWN; SHUT YOUR MOUTH AND SMACKDOWN; HERE COMES THE PAIN. THE GAMEPLAY IS ACTUALLY VERY SLOW [WHICH IS SOMETHING I'VE BEGAN NOTICING RECENTLY] THE CONTROLS AREN'T AS ADVANCED AS THE LATER GAMES ARE, AND YOU'LL JUST BE WASTING MONEY BUYING THIS GAME WHEN YOU CAN GET ONE OF THE MORE RECENT SMACKDOWN GAMES. DON'T PICK THIS ONE UP NOW. IT ALREADY SEEMS DATED AND POINTLESS NOW.	-1
This will also be my review for every subsequent SmackDown! game. After WCW started to lose popularity, THQ started to do WWF-themed wrestling games. When it did, even beginning on the N64, there were hints that they were turning what was a good system into complete crap. They finally succeded (so to speak, if that was their actual intent) when they started the SmackDown! series. I have no problems with the graphics, the entrances, or the sound in this game. I have the biggest problem however with the gameplay and how the game controls. First off, they gave the game arcade style feel and controls. Big mistake. They also made it more like the actual show: you have to continually punch the guy before you can start doing grappling moves. I may be in the minority, but constantly punching a guy gets old fast. I want to be able to start throwing suplexes and hitting piledrivers right off the bat. Secondly, the game's A.I. has gotten extremely intelligent. Too intelligent. The game can kick your ass unless you're a great gamer, and I'm just average, maybe a little below. Mainly because of the counter system. The game goes like this: punch, punch, punch, punch, grapple, move-counter move-counter move, etc. You'll get countered excessively, and your counters won't work most of the time. Yes, it is a lot like the actual wrestling you watch on TV, but for a wrestling game to be fun in my opinion, it can't be realistic in terms of following how an actual wrestling match would go. I don't want to spend over an hour or more in a match, 15-30 minutes is plenty, unless it's a Royal Rumble-type match. THQ threw out the window the great grappling engine they had with the N64 games and has replaced it with this tripe. I honestly don't understand what the fans see in this series of game. I guess if you like your matches in the game to follow how the matches on the show work, and you enjoy the actual wrestling to a be a chore and full of non-stop punching and countering, than this is the game for you. If you want an actual FUN wrestling game, then I suggest you stick with THQ's WCW games on the N64. At least then, they had the right idea.	-1
this game is the worst. it has bad gameplay and bad graphics, so what ever you dodont buy this game.	-1
This game really isn't as good as WWF Smackdown!2, but I think that it has 2 things in it that should of been carried over to the sequel. One, You can Re-name your finishing move so it sounds cooler, like if your name is Jack, You can do the Jackcold Stunner instead of Stonecold, the other, in this version you can see the move names as you do them, it was really helpful when I had a Backyard Wrestling Federation, it made choreographing the matches easier.	-1
Well, where do I start?  We all know about the basics.......the lack of tech support, the missing roleplaying element, and the incredible lag. But it isn't these things that make this game so horrid to play.  One can wing  it without tech support........and I have on MANY occasions, out of  necessity........I can also wait out lag or just reconnect.  I missed the  "Quest" part of Everquest.....but still managed to get some  enjoyment out of the graphics.  Now.....here's the REAL reason why you  shouldn't get EverQuest.  After around level 15 or so (if you are a  talented soloist), you are FORCED to group to gain levels. That's right  folks.  You have NO choice in the matter.  Guess what this means?  This  means you have to group with 5 other vicious, backstabbing whining,  complaining 13 year olds that have absolutely no respect and little if any  regard for you.  I'd much rather put my trust in a rabid pit bull than  trust the life of my character to a cleric who plays like a  wizard. Enough said.  You will probably buy this game.....and probably  think back on this review and say "Well, he was right after all".  And I have only one thing to say to that.........I TOLD YOU SO.	-1
I qualify as a Might & Magic Junky, having played all of the series since #1.  The best aspect of these games is the development of the team.  In my family, each person becomes a "named" character with a personality to suit the mood of the game. You always had your choice to be a good or bad.  MM8 has lost all this. You now can only create/name one character on your team, and it's tough to be a good character. Only two of the eight allowed classes have possitive sounding attributes. The entire game has a dark and gloomy presentation, such as if you want a top knotch wizard, you need to be a Lich.  Ugh! A Lich is to be killed, not personified. No longer can my family enjoy being their own chacters. You now "higher" your remaining (computer named) team characters.  But, just when you spend all those spell points/money to become a master/grandmaster, you have to drop this body from the team to make room for a someone else in order to complete a specific quest.  Too much comming and going. Too depressing. Not fun at all.	-1
Might and Magic VIII was really a dissapointment when I first played it.  It has the same game engine as its most recent prequil, but with some downsides. First you only get to create one character, your main character,  and the rest of your party is filled up with characters you meet. Second,  and lastly, the characters are ugly expecially the male knights. If your a  diehard Might and Magic fan (like me) you should definitely buy it (to add  to your collection) if not stay away from it.  I don't like to dis Might  and Magic, but when a product stinks, it stinks.	-1
Having played M&M6 and M&M7, I was really looking forward to this game.  Unfortunately, once I started I lost interest pretty quickly.  It is so similar to the earlier games that I felt I was just replaying one of the  other titles. My biggest problem is that there have been few if any  upgrades to the basic game engine since #6.  Don't get me wrong, I like the  basic game engine.  The world looks interesting and is easy to navigate.  However, some of the problems that first bothered me in 6 have become even  more annoying in the later titles.  Namely: HOARDS OF UNINTELLIGENT  MONSTERS: All monsters in the M&M universe behave in exactly the same  way.  Once they see you, they charge to attack.  (OK.  A few will shoot at  you from range, but the principle is still the same.) No opponents use even  rudimentary tactics. As a result, every fight feels the same.  And there  are A LOT of fights.  There are so many damn monsters in this game that  your finger will get sore from pressing the attack key, and the repetition  gets pretty mind numbing.  In particular, I got sick of the pirates on the  first island.  There's a trigger zone that creates new ones every time you  enter it.  How many times do we really want to kill the same monster  off? MONSTERS DON'T REACT TO EVENTS AROUND THEM: The game uses the tired  D&D cliche of the dungeon crawl.  That is, you go into the first room,  kill everything there. Rest.  Move on to next room.  Repeat.  Guards in  other rooms don't react to your presence until you attack them, even if  that is months later.  Frankly, I would be happier if the next game in the  series used a system like the one in Fallout 2, where all the guards in a  complex react in a coordinated way to your presence once they realize that  you are there.  This forces you to use stealth, dialog skills, and to  really think about who you attack and when. THE STORY IS STILL VERY  LINEAR: Basically, you have a bunch of quests you have to do.  You have no  real choices in who you ally yourself with and who you attack.  The world  consists of people you talk to and people you kill, with no overlap between  the two. THE NPC SYSTEM COULD BE VASTLY IMPROVED:  You have no choice in  how you handle NPC's.  You hear what they have to say, then do their quests  for them.  I would much rather see the game move towards an NPC systme like  the one in Fallout 2, which is really quite good. Your lead character's INT  determines how many things he can think of to say, and his oratory skill  determines how well he can lie and manipulate people.  And you always seem  to have at least two or three different ways to approach any  NPC. Overall, my big problem with this game is that there just isn't a  lot of thinking involved, or much freedom of action for the player.  You  slog your way through endless fights against repetitive and brainless  monsters, only to collect a reward and then do more of the same.	-1
Alien Vs Predator is a first person shooter. AVP has a very poor AI and does not have much of a storyline, It is just a get from point A to point B by killing everything that comes in your way. You could play as three different charecters Alien, Predator and a Colonial Marine. ALIEN : The Alien levels compared to the others are very easy. It does not have any weapons besides it's claws and tail, So to kill someone it needs to get very near the enemy, But a couple of attacks could kill the enemy. It moves really fast and can walk on walls or any surfaces. It can see clearly even in darkness. The alien gameplay is orginal and a initially a lot of fun but gets boring fast because the same thing happens in every level, No new weapons or new enemies. MARINE : The marine levels are very difficult and quite unplayable. He has a lot of weapons but is given only a few for the levels and sometimes after the level completion the weapons collected are taken away and is given only a few. Each level have a lot of monstors but you can't see them comming because the levels are very dark and you need to use the image intesifier to look ahead, It makes the dark areas green and the bright areas white, If you fire a weapon with the image intense on the screen becomes white and you cant see where the enemey is. One minuite you could be walking with full health and aurmor but before you know it zero health, zero aurmor and game over. The marine levels are very difficult even on the easy difficulty. PREDATOR : Compared to the marine the predator levels are very easy but not as easy as the alien. The predator moves very slowly and can become almost invisible, It has many weapons and can take a lot of damage. The predator has four types of visions to see in total darkness and it can also heal itself. Each of the three charecters have six levels each, If you complete a charecter you could unlock a few bonus missions, And the number of bonus missions that is unlocked depends on the difficulty you play. AVP Gold has a limited number of saves depending on the difficulty. I would recommend you to play on the hardest difficulty (Director's Cut), Though it would be very difficult it would unlock many bonus mission, I don't think there is any difference between the difficulties besides the number of saves you are limited. AVP's graphics are sound are ok, The special effects are very good. Compared to the other games it ran very smooth and it did not crash much either. Alien Vs Predator is a good game but only for very good gamers, It is the most hardest and the most frustrating game i have ever played.	-1
Challenging? No, Impossible is more like it! Just remember to download the cheat codes first before playing this game, you'll need them.   The graphics, sound and user interface are exceptional but those features are over-shadowed by the short amount of time players stay alive in the game. This is not really a serious gaming experience, its more of an exercise in futility. The only time you'll last longer than an alka-seltzer tablet in a glass of water is when you play as the Predator and even then your life span is not that long.  The alien can't heal and the marine is the ultimate victim. The game settings should not be "Easy", "Medium" and "Hard"; they should be changed to "Slow Suicide", "Quick Death" and "Don't Bother Fighting Back".	-1
This game could have been so much more.  The hack and slash action is not even fun, it just get's tedious and boring.  I have to admit the graphic's are spectacular, but that does not make this a great game.  Rune contains lot's of jumping from object to object, which will get boring after they first introduce it into the game.  The game also had no depth whatsoever.  I never just want to play it for fun, because I felt there almost is no fun in this game.  In my opinion, if you are going to get a hack and slash action game GET BLADE OF DARKNESS.	-1
Tenchu2 itself isn't an utterly terrible game--I know I've put in a good  10 hours or more on it, but what's frustrating is how there is so much  promise and so much failure both in the same package.  The feel of the game  is that Activision rushed this one out the door, and throughout the game  you'll find bugs, glitches and all sorts of annoying problems that would  lead one to believe that the game wasn't even beta tested.  Here's my list  of gripes: -The controls are worse than Tenchu 1:  Of course, Tenchu 1 is  clunky but they are even worse here.  A lot of would-be perfect kills will  get ruined because what should have landed you right on top of your enemy  has you rolling out in front of them or some other stupid  stunt. -Ridiculous AI:  Tenchu 1 did not have the best AI but it was far  superior to this.  I've walked in front of guards and had them not see me.  On the other hand, some guards are capable of seeing me through the back of  their head.  Also, guards quickly forget your presence and seem completely  uninterested in pursuing you once you are out of sight.  Yup, you can be  one foot away from them but under water, and neither can they see through  the water nor are they patient enough to wait even a minute to see if  you'll resurface (nor wonder why a bamboo air-pipe is suddenly sticking out  of the water.)  This is really a let down given that there were reports  that the AI would be vastly improved, guards noting blood running along a  stream or looking for fallen bodies (blood doesn't run down stream in the  game anyway.)  Other guards can see you without even being present.  This  is a neat trick when your KI meter is in the teens or lower and you can't  see anyone but they can see you. -Graphic interface or whatever you want  to call it:  Graphics are just plain sloppy--my ninja is often teleported  up four feet instead of actually having to climb or jump over fences  anymore .  In the same manner, when dragging bodies I've been able to leave  them hanging in mid air, as though supported by an invisible floor of  glass. -Graphics in general:  Sometimes the backgrounds go through  objects (IE you can see the sun and clouds THROUGH a wall of mountains.  Also, sometimes you can see guards out of your perriphrial vision but not  straight ahead. -Inconsistancy with stealth kills:  Again, not only can  guards see you out of the back of their head, but some -cannot- be stealth  killed. PERIOD.  This wasn't evident until playing Tatsumaru's 'labor  shortage' level where certain guards could not be knocked unconscious even  with 20 tries or so.  Incidentally, this level seems nearly unbeatable and  I think gives even more evidence that this was a rushed job.  With 20 tries  on this level, I could not beat it, and I can't say I really want to  anymore. -Difficulty level:  A good friend of mine nearly sold this  within the first week until we dug up the cheat code.  The game is nearly  unplayable without the armor, but it is almost impossible to get a grand  master, so you can't get the armor. This would be different if I could  start looting guards for blow darts on level 1, but even then, those are  useless against bosses, and between the combination of worsened controls,  bad camera angles and 'two hits and your dead' boss damage, Activision has  managed to take all the fun out of Tenchu and turned it into a tedious and  frustrating derision of the first game. -Voice assignment:  This is  thefunniest glitch.  Sometimes the voices of the guards are the wrong  gender, and probably the glitch that had me laughing the hardest was when  the shark started talking.  C'mon folks!  The shark should not talk.  Please test your game before releasing it. -Mission editor is a joke:  Ok, this isn't really a glitch, but really, I can't even make roofs in this  thing.  The saving grace would have been being able to make an island full  of cats or something, but all you get are boring people (maybe you can make  a bunch of godha's samurai and evil samurai line up like some insane  football game?) My overall take on this game is that while Activision  certainly added a lot of new things to make Tenchu the 5/5 it should have  been, they lost it where it really counted--the outstanding game play that  made Tenchu 1.  Sure, Tenchu 2 has a lot of improvements, but none of this  makes up for the lack of AI, a soundtrack, good controls, and an  environment that reacts in a realistic way instead of one that has so many  bugs in it I never know how it will react. I sincerely hope Tenchu 3  will be the game this should have been.  There are a lot of great ideas  here, but they just seem so poorly executed that it makes one long for the  game this should have been. It's still somewhat enjoyable (especially with  the cheat codes), and its glitchyness is sometimes amusing, but all and all  it isn't worth the $40 price tag--maybe you should look around your local  vendors...my used copy will be showing up soon :)	-1
this game kinda stinks.you go talk to this old dude who gives you these long drawn out battle plans.then you watch these long drawn out cut scenes.then you go into these map/worlds.when you get near an enemy,you fight.well,sort of.the computer does everything.theres a lot of complicated planning involved.theres no clear cut way to figure out anything.its a real pain in the hiney.whats more is i don't belive i even saw any ogres.of course im only on like level 2 since the game is totaly screwed.i bought it used and the guy before me only got that far too.no wonder i got this so cheap.this game will use up all of your extra brain space.if you thought out how to beat it.you wouldnt have the brain sense left to eat cheerios.someone would have to run you an iv.youd almost have to be like freakin fixated on its ended.its totaly freakin ridiculous.and then ,as you're being slain by little people with sticks,even though you're sporting a dragon,you are helpless to defend yourself.it sucks.	-1
I've played several sonic games(14 to be exact), and this one is probably the worst. It's probably the best one on genesis, but I don't have a clue what they were thinking when they made this one. there's nowhere to run or speed up in this game. in the console version, I used to dash through the loops and run down the spirals until time ran out. in the fist zone, the only place where you can even come close to having fun with the sonic speed that made the series famous is going down some hills on a rickety set of tracks in a mine cart. Infact, I didn't see a single loop, or any spirals, or anything relative to one. there is hope though, sonic chaos is so much fun that it's probably worth 12 copies of this game. the most important thing to remember if you want to buy sonic 2 for game gear is not to expect anything nearly as good as the console version, so get sonic chaos.	-1
This game was too easy, too stupide, not enough challange, shall I go on?  After so many good games for this creampuff he finally got into a bad game.  Let's hope this is only a fluke like for Sonic (Who made a number of bad  games after "Sonic & Knuckles") before we got "Sonic  Adventure."	-1
Instead of getting a new, eye popping, extremely hardcore, extremely dope and a totally revolutionary game, we got a game that was released months before. Like many of you, I was very disappointed. I'm a big fan of ECDub. I even flew out to Philly once for it. But when I bought ECW Hardcore Revolution, I got totally ripped off. All it is was WWF Attitude with different wrestlers and a Barbed Wire match. Nothing was really changed about it either. Same gameplay, same graphics, same everything, and total dissatisfaction. Granted yes when Acclaim lost the title to release WWF games and nearly killed the WWF franchise with it's awful new games (not including any of the older Acclaim WWF releases on SNES), why didn't they learn anything from that and not do that to EC F'n W??? Like I said it was the same game as WWF Attitude, which wasn't all that good either but it was entertaining for a while. Now granted yes that in theory, this should have been fun too but by the time this was released, we'd seen all of that and then some in WWF Attitude and there was truly no need for this game unless you loved the ECW brand. Don't get this one. Even if it was the last thing that had anything to do with ECW you could still do without this game. If you really had your heart set on collecting anything from ECW, I would suggest getting some old ECW DVD's and VHS (if you still have VHS). That way at least you'll be able to hang onto the last threads of the TRUE EC F'n W.	-1
I have been enjoying the ace combat series for sometime now. But this one leaves alot to be desired. The mission briefs were dull and very uninspired. The missions themselves were very similar. It didn't take long before one mission seemed the same as the next.  The aircraft designs were very cool and that was the best part of the game. Some of them were nigh brilliant. Although most of them were enemy aircraft.   I finished the game in around 3 hours which makes its lasting appeal minimal. I am waiting to see what they are going to do on the PS2.   If you played the others then give it a play. It's still an okay way to spend a couple of hours.	-1
If you have played this game in the arcade or on a Dreamcast unit you know how fast and colorful a fighting game this one is.  Truth is it is one of  the best 2D figthers you can play. Here is the bad news though,  if you  own a Playstation and want this translation you will be disapointed when  you play.  First of all the lack of the tag feature really does kill this  game.  Without being able to tag in another teamate mid battle it takes  away some of the games statagy.  I think it also seems to move and load  much slower on the playstation than in the Dreamcast.  We just have to face  it, this game is a next generation game on a five year old piece of  hardware, and it just does not live up to its true potential.  I love my  plastation, but I have to advise all to pass on Marvel vs. Capcom for it.  Play Street Fighter Alpha 3 instead if you insist on getting the best 2D  fighting action you can out of your old Playstation box.	-1
The dreamcast is the WAY better version to get as this one is too slow and too easy. The playstation port of this game is sadly inept, i am a PSX fan but this game does stand short to the over versions.	-1
I'm a big time 2D fighting veteran and I can tell which fighter is worth playing all over and which is worth ditching. Marvel VS Capcom for the PlayStation is an example of one of those 2D fighters that needs to be ditched. But don't get me wrong ! I actually liked the game...on the Dreamcast and arcade. The PlayStation version of Marvel VS Capcom is just swarming with a whole lot of flaws. Trust me ! This is not arcade perfect ! Most of the times, arcade translations that go to the PlayStation come out imperfect like this one. The graphics are just horrible ! Sure the characters and stages look colorful, but if you pay attention to the framerates of the animations, you'll notice that the characters don't move smoothly or move faster. The audio, sounds great. Music tracks and sound effects are brilliant, but nothing special at all. And as for the gameplay, just horrible. And the lack of a tag feature ? Now this is really going overboard ! Just like in Marvel Super Heroes VS Street Fighter for the PlayStation, you have to call up your character to do a one-hit special move. If you want the tag feature, you'll have use the cross over mode, but this feature doesn't emulate the tag features on the superior arcade and Dreamcast versions. The controls could've been slicker, but instead, it ended up choppy. It seems that the PlayStation controller was not meant for great games like this. All in all, the PSX version of Marvel VS Capcom is a big letdown. Choppy animation, choppy controls, lack of a tag feature, and long loading times during the beginning of each fight really makes this game look like a zero. If you want the real Marvel VS Capcom experience, I'd say buy the Dreamcast version of Marvel VS Capcom or spare a few quarters or tokens to play the arcade version. The DC version of Marvel VS Capcom featured flawless animations, awesome graphics, hyper fast controls, no loading times, and a tag feature. Now that's an arcade perfect translation of one of the best 2D arcade fighters of all time ! The DC version is definently worth the money and worth your time ! Please ! Whatever you do, avoid the PSX version ! This version of Marvel VS Capcom is a disgrace to Capcom's ever expanding lineup of 2D fighters ! Not really something to use your money on !	-1
#1 - VISIBILITY. I had to screw with the brightness on my television just so I could see the opening screen right. Everything is in a million shades of green, and you'll be constantly running into obstacles, trying to turn yourself around while an enemy slowly chips away at your health. #2 - DIFFICULTY. On the easist setting, I still can only get three levels into the game. It's not that I'm a lousy gamer, it's just that certain spots where there may be a concentration of plastic helicoptors, infantry, etc., are next to impossible to get around. I let a friend who is an excellent gamer borrow it for a week, and he couldn't get any farther than I did. #3 - TWO-PLAYER MODE. Two-player modes are supposed to be fun. This one, well... isn't. The levels are too big, and you'll spend ten minutes hunting down your friend's flag, and once one of you gets the other's flag, it's too easy to cross back over into your territory without getting caught. Please, I beg of you, don't make this an impulse buy like I did! Rent first, and even then you'll probably feel like you've wasted your money. (1.5 stars)	-1
Not anywhere as good or fun as the original Armymen 3D. This game has one and two player modes. The graphics and fighting environments have been "improved". There are times when your soldier cannot walk under a  leaf or around a small rock, the zoom feature which worked so well in the  original has been replaced with an inferior much slower zoom/aim feature.  Ammo crates so easy to see and obtain in the original have been replaced by  icons that are hard to see against the background of plants and rocks. In  two player mode you are not able to assign your allies to attack or  defense, the computer does it for you. While playing the computer I noticed  the artificial intelligence seemed to get confused, for example while  attacking a villiage a bunch of tan soldiers ran to attack me, they then  stopped and stood there while I blasted away at them. You are often able to  stand in sight of the enemy and get no reaction, even in the hard setting.  Many actions are slower than in Armymen 3D. On the bright side it is better  than Sarge's Heros, there are no bathtub battle senarios, this is more  realistic. It is cool the way you have to "finish off" the  wounded enemy. I was real excited about this game, I bought the day it went  on sale, it was a real let down to me. We will just have to keep playing  the original to have fun game play. You will find nothing like Snake  Canyon, Cabin Fever or Tanks Alot in this new game, sorry back to the  drawing board.	-1
There is nothing to do in this game its very redundant. Its only fun for 30 or so minutes...It is way too short also...But it is very detailed,like when you swipe your sword on the wall the sword will bounce back and make a spark and most games just have the sword go through the wall...The graphics are very good. The gameplay is ok,the guy swipes the sword fast as hell,the bosses are easy,or most of them are. I reccomend buying this game if you won't get tired of stuff and like a lot of bloodlust.	-1
Another game tip from me: to win at any difficulty level, go towards you opponent, duck, then hit A or B (your choice) to make the enemy's energy bar shorter and shorter until, you guessed right, he's dead. Repeat that nine times and... you beated the game! don't bother with the few special moves of the character, they make the game harder.	-1
Not so much a game as a mild thumb workout, 'Mutant Academy' looks nice  (it's by the same people who did the excellent GBC version of 'Street  Fighter Alpha') but is much too easy. You can quite literally win every  fight by holding down 'right' and pressing the 'A' button extremely  quickly, and it's surprising that the creators didn't spot this before they  released the game. There are plenty of X-people to play as, and there's a  handy 'VS' mode so that you can bore a friend, but unless you deliberately  handicap yourself this isn't much of a game, which is a shame as there  aren't many decent beat-em-ups on the GBC.	-1
I'm a pretty good gamer, but sometimes there's a few little hidden "extras" in a game worth checking out.  GameShark lets you do it.  If you're patient.  And have a lot of time.  And don't mind HOPING that your codes work after you swith the GS disc with the game.  And don't care that it doesn't fit in port 1, so many games it works for can't even use it. ....	-1
The concept is great, but the game stumbles on several points.  A couple points have been well-covered (third-person view is clumsy; too much of the game depends on figuring out what the game designers wanted you to do); in addition, there's: 1) often the puzzles are logically inconsistent.  At one point you have to kill a limo driver, but later on the limo is driven off -- by WHO???  In another level, you have to pretend to be a guy working at a club, so you can get to a point to also pretend to be a patron of the club. 2) The game consists of a series of assassinations.  Each one requires planning to get the job done, which is reasonable; but often the planning requires information that can only be found by playing the level then losing, then playing the level again.  This is kind of missing the point of the planning parts of the game.  It's not really "planning" when all your doing is playing then finding out what doesn't work. 3) You can't save in the middle of a level.  This is annoying enough, but it's really annoying when you're in the middle of a level then the game crashes.	-1
..Until I read Rob Matthews' review of this game. I am also stuck on the training mission. I never got past it since I would go up the elevator, shoot a guard and then wind up at the beginning. This is a bug to end all bugs. It felt like I was in that Star Trek episode where they kept repeating the same day over and over again.  I had high hopes for this game...	-1
Looking at the box of this game i expected it to be really cool, and from reading all the reviews that say it was good, but when i bought it, it was a very large dissapointment.  After the first few missions the game becomes so frustrating, that you will want to break your computer.  The controls are very messed up, and the camera fews always get stuck on walls so you can not see anything.  This game is frustrating because 90% of the game is trial and error.  If you go the wrong way you become ..., because most of the missions are timed ... so you lose the mission.  I got to admit the visuals in this game are very eye pleasing, but it doesn't not make this game worth the ... that it is.  HC47 also had tons of glitches and bugs in its system which eventually ... the ... out of you.  Well my opinion is not to buy this game, but u can try it for yourself, and see what you think	-1
The initial thought of the game seems good enough: trying to break down the all-too-linear approach to first person shooters, and give the player alternative ways to finish off your objectivies. But this is exactly where the game fails. The missions are clearly designed for two specific approaches: (1) Blast your way through (which is remarkably easy) or follow a very fixed stealth route. The first level could be an example. Here you are supposed to assassin an important trial member. You can then either choose to shoot everything that moves, or get on top of a building an snipe the target. Those are basically your two options. And quite frankly, I had expected a much more open gameplay. The computer A.I. is also horribly bad. On one level, you can easily stand against a corner, shoot two guards that are in the room, and then wait for other guards to come running in and shoot them too (all the time you hardly take a hit). Here's another example: At one point you're supposed to kill a trial leader. After having disguised yourself as a waiter, you attempt to give him a poisened bowl of soup. Unfortunately for the trial leader's bodyguard, he has to taste the soup and ends up dying. There's a cinematic gunfight where the leader escapes. Now here's the thing: after the gunfight, everything returns to normal and all the trial guards in the resturaunt doesn't seem to have noticed anything. The positive thing about the game are the graphics. The movement of the characters are fairly realistic. I especially like dragging corpses behind me and watch how their bodies bump into furniture and such. If you try dumping a body over a toilet, you'll see how it slumps down the side and falls to rest on the floor. Very nice. The jungle levels are also impressive, with the trees and the plants. But as they say: gameplay above graphics, and here "Hitman" fails miserably.	-1
I got this game cause my cousin gave it to me.  The concept sounded awesome - like you're this hitman going around doing missions and killing people.  To be honest, I have not finished the game.  The action is very slow paced.  You have to plan things out.  There's no way you can finish a map the first try cause you have to know the pattern.  For example, when the limo driver makes his routine routes, or when the bad guys go inside the shops, or when the bystanders are not looking, etc.... At first it starts out really fun - like everyone has mentioned.  But as I progressed in the game, the missions got a lot bigger, harder, and more complex.  Even the maps get more bigger and it's so big that it takes forever to get around.  sometimes you have to do 6 sub-missions on one map, which can suck because if you screw up on the 4th sub-mission, for example, then you gotta start all over again.  basically it's a lot of trial and error.  I'm more into fast paced games like Half life and counter-strike and Unreal tournament and Delta Force so this wasn't my type of game.  I basically got bored of this game and it does get frustrating.  Maybe it'll be better with a cheat or whatever.  But I'm going back to playing counter-strike and Unreal Tournament.  It's time to pass this game to my other cousin.	-1
After purchasing Deux Ex and falling in love with that game, I looked within the Eidos family to find another FPS with the same kind of action and functionality as Deus Ex, after reading many good reviews on Hitman I decided to give it a day in court.  I just want to say that Hitman is a satisfying game in its own right, but when compared to Soldier of Fortune and Deus Ex it simply can't hold its water.  So I urge you to give Deus Ex a try, and give Hitman a go only if you have a day to spare to fly through it.	-1
Yes, this game is amazingly difficult, as the "Cons" say up above. The enemies do the same thing every time you play the level, so basically you just play the same level over and over to find out the scripting of that level so you can make an attempt to beat it. And quick, your hit might leave, so it's timed. Also, it took me an hour to beat the tutorial, which is required. And, even worse, you can't save during levels which makes it frustrating. Barely over 10 small maps. Maybe a few more. Bad Game.	-1
i'm going to guess these people make console games or wish they did This game is 3rd person, a *really* bad choice for this game. The camera is often stuck behind things This game is hard. That's OK, but you can't save a game, and you *will* die thanks to some surprises, so expect to get bored playing the same thing over and over There are only 11 maps i think, and most are _very_ small. The game is short, although they stretch out the game play by preventing you from saving the game It's a minor complaint, but why don't any of these Asian gangsters recognize a tall, white, albino, bald guy with a UPC code on his head? Is his disguise of a shirt and pants really that good? There are numerous bugs. Or maybe they aren't bugs, just bad design choices. For example, you can't walk through a guarded gate unless you first touch someone who has walked through it - bizare This could have been a really good game, but it isn't.	-1
I had looked forward to this game for months.  It installed without incident.  The problem I had was the tutorial, beginning with the elevator (lesson #4).  The booklet says to "call elevator".  I didn't have to because the elevator was already there with its door open.  Then the instructions are to click on the control panel and select "basement level 3".  Clicking on the control panel did not work.  What did work was to spin wildly inside the elevator clicking on the walls and everything else until it moved.  Then I go to the very last Lesson (9) with the sniper rifle.  I could not put it down and was unable to finish the tutorial, and as a result could not play the game.  This game is loaded with bugs.  Don't take my word for it--go to eidosinteractive.com and look at the forums for Hitman.  I wasn't the only one to have trouble in the elevator.	-1
Don't get me wrong, this game isn't that bad, but there are quite a few things that I don't like about it. For one, you can only do so much stunts, that they get boring very quickly, and in no time you would get bored of the current event you are doing. There are several game types that you can choose from, like Stunts, Baja, and some others that let you go through courses. These aren't that fun, for me. I don't have much to say for this game, except I would not want anyone to get it, maybe if its in the bargain bin for 1.99..	-1
After suffering through the first "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" game, I felt hopeless. I was dazed and confused. I didn't have a whisper of hope for the future of humanity. And then I saw the second game in the series on the shelves. I said, "I'd heard the questions aren't repeated as much", and I decided to buy it just to see if it was true. It's true, the questions aren't repeated as much as before. The problem is, now they're MUCH harder! It's impossible to get anything higher than $16,000 now! And since the questions don't repeat, you'll never get to the top! But what's the worst part? That's the ONLY CHANGE that was made to this game. NOTHING ELSE!!!!! It's as if the first game had no problems whatsoever! Regis is STILL appallingly rude and impatient, the "Fastest Finger" mode STILL doesn't let you put the four answers in order, the game STILL quits if you take too long to do things, you STILL can't skip the introduction sequence, the Phone-a-friend lifeline is STILL worthless, there's STILL no option to make the games easier or harder, you STILL only get instructions once, and there's STILL no option to use the mouse! Regis even says EXACTLY the same stuff as before! I bought the game out of total curiosity, just to see if this game was really any better than the first. As it turns out, it is virtually the EXACT SAME GAME. It has all the problems of the first, except for one which was replaced by another one! This game has not been improved one bit over the first.  The makers didn't even try to improve it.  This game displays total laziness and lack of creativity.  It's not worth one second of your time.	-1
Now, those of you who entered the playstation2 product description and buying info in Amazon.com probably are interested in buying the system, or  comparing it to the DreamCast.  Hopefully, you will stumble upon this  review.  I am going to give a non-biased review (for the fist part)that  will give viewers something to think about when investigating which new  system they will buy:  DC (Dreamcast) or the playstation2, or wait awhile  for new technology.......  My own thoughts and opinions are at the end. So, here's part 1:  Amazon.com doesn't give the complete specs and  information for either of these competitors.  When choosing a system,it all  comes down to pure horsepower, and of course, the games.  The Sega  Dreamcast is looking good, with a 200MHz, 128bit central processor,  compared to PlayStation2's precise 294.912MHz, 128bit CPU. Sony is  promising 32Mb of memory, plus 4Mb of video memory for the picture and 2Mb  dedicated to sound effects and music. Sega on the other hand has already  bundled 16Mb of main memory, 8Mb of video RAM and, likewise, 2Mb of sound  memory (with a Yamaha sound card, which is a big plus). Due to the  Dreamcast's 16mb of main memory, it is hard to convert PC games to  Dreamcast.  But, PlayStation2's video memory isn't that great, which could  limit high-resolution textures and image complexity. In plain old  english, they both are almost equal in how the games will run (they'll run  great), but the way the memory is divied up is different.  But what  about the games?  Dreamcast has a lead over the playstation2 system with  many more games because of it's earlier release date.  On the other hand,  the playstation2 can play old playstation games (which won't use the full  playstation2 capacity).  I would have to say that in time the playstation2  will have more games, just look at the HUGE slew of games the playstation  has now.  On the other hand, many of sega's games have gotten fabulous  reviews, meaning that although sega probably won't release as many titles  compared to playstation2, the games that they will release will be great,  just look at Soul Calibur for example, or Crazy Taxi. The "extras  and freebies" on a system also influence many buyers.  The dreamcast  homes a 56k internal modem which will allow users to play games such as the  upcoming titles NBA and NFL 2K1 (not to be confused with NBA and NFL 2k)  and Quake3 over the internet.  The Playstation2 though, will allow buyers  to watch DVDs on the system. Playstation will release a modem for the  system in the future.  Well, there you have it, good old complete  specs.   Part 2:  now for my personal opinions.  I myself, investigated  both systems VERY carefully.......and decided to go with the Dreamcast  system over the playstation2.  Yes, you read correctly, the Dreamcast over  the Playstation2.  By now you're thinking, "why would anyone do such a  thing? "  There are several reasons.  One:  The dreamcast utilizes the  modem right from the get-go, while the playstation2 won't be giving users  the opportunity to use it for awhile, and Sony has not yet given detail to  when it will be able to be used.  Thus, one of the Playstation2's  "freebies" is going to be useless for some time.  Two:  DVD?  Didn't Sony realize that a measely 4mb of video memory just won't do it for  DVD's?  You need much more memory and a higher processor speed to run DVD's  smoothly on a system like such.  For example, to run DVD's very smoothly on  a computer would require 500 mghz plus 16 mb of video memory, or even more.  True, you can run it on 300 mghz and it will run well, but with that  amount of video memory the picture would be terrible, which defeats the  purpose of DVD's.  Thus, both of the Playstation2's freebies are worthless  (or for some period of time when dealing with the modem).  Three:  The  sound processor is mediocre to sub-par on the Playstion2, where as the  Yamaha processor on the dreamcast is a fine piece of hardware.  And lastly,  Four:  a small but VERY annoing querk, the Playstaion2 has only 2  controller slots!  The DreamCast has 4, supporting small parties and get  togethers with friends. All in all, I personally think the Dreamcast,  with its great hardware specs and head start with it's amount of game  titles is a better buy.  And it's 100 bucks cheaper.  Now, I'm sure MANY  people will disagree with me in the second part of the review, but no one  can disagree with me on the plain old specs in the first part.  So, please  readers, keep this in mind when making your decision.  Thank you.	-1
Okay people it's time for me to really point out reasons to NOT buy a PS2  now that I actually got several hours of gaming with this system (And five  different games) to come up with my answer!  To start out I visited my  friends house one day and saw his new Playstation 2 he had gotten.  When I  asked if we could play it, he didn't really want to (This from a guy who  has three and a half shelf's with nothing but Playstation games!!!  That's  practically every game Sony made!!!), but finally agreed.  I can now see  why.  Not only were the games NOTHING Sony promised us (They said the games  were going to be a revolution.  I fail to see how.).  For one thing the  graphics are nothing that the Dreamcast hasn't offered us.  For onther  things were still getting the sames games over, and over!  Just with better  graphics!  No internet play (SEGA already has an advantage with that in  mind!), and didn't Sony promise us it would be compatable with Playstation  games?  I thought so too.  But only 3 of the 27 games we tried to do this  with worked!  And it didn't enhance the graphics!!!  The DVD player is  nothing but trash also.  It won't play many movies, and those it does play  don't have very good quality!  Plus DVD players are on cell phones  practically, why would we want them on a game counsel (Especally if you've  already got a DVD player)!?!  Plus almost all games (Playstation or  Playstation 2 games) freeze up countless times!  In Tekken because I was  fighting too fast the system froze up on me, but yet in Sonic Adventure (On  Dreamcast) I'm running on walls, jumping off buldings, and zooming around  the place at 70 miles per hour and the game doesn't glich once!!!  Now  thats sad (For Sony anyway).  And when it comes down to the worst games  I've played yet, don't expect this system to last long.  With that in mind  please be careful when buying this system, it might be worse thanyou  thought it would be.	-1
I love video games but this is a big WASTE OF MONEY.  I usually stick to  Nintendo but thought I'd go play it.  It's just like Playstation.  I'm sure  you should wait for the X-Box or especially the Dolphin.	-1
All digimon fans out there rejoiced when this game came out, and so, so many were disappointed.  Why?  Lets see Holy Highlighter's standard breakdown: GRAPHICS:  2/10 - This game SORELY lacks, by any standards.  While I wasn't expecting it to rival high-end RPGs by high-end companies like Sony, Konami, and Square, this game's graphics are remniscent of the earliest playstation games, and I thought developers had moved far beyond this.  Blah!  Blah!  At least the FMV is decent. SOUND:  1/10 - Ok, the sound quality is just God awful.  That, and the digimon sounds are really damn annoying, like the fact that a blaringly ugly sound is made every time a legless digimon "hops".  You would think that since this game would only become popular due to the TV show that they might have included the theme song...but no, of course not! CHARACTERS:  5/10 - The characters are decently developed, I suppose, and reflect the typical air-headed attitude of the TV show.  The biggest gripe of most gamers is that none of the TV characters make an appearance!  What's the point of having a Digimon game without any of the characters from the show?  Another fatal misstep on the part of the designers - most of the awesomely cool, powerful digimon from the show never show up.  There is also very little control over which digimon your basic digimon evolves into, which annoys me greatly.  The other annoying aspect is that every 2 hours of gameplay or so, your digimon dies and you have to start the process all...over...again. PLOT/STORYLINE: 2/10 - There isn't one.  That's all there is to say - the whole "lets bring digimon back to file city" crap is not plot, it's a pathetic excuse.  99% of the actions of the digimon do not revolve around the plot. SYSTEM/INTERFACE:  3/10 - The battle system is unique, which is the only plus this game has.  In order to make your digimon even close to usable, you have to play an assortment of "minigames", where you walk up to a sign, press a button, and lo-and-behold, your digimon gains stats.  At first, I thought that letting the digimon participate longer in this game would make them gain more stat points - but it doesn't matter, so basically more mindless button mashing is all that this thing does for you.  Battling is 99% of the game, and it gets boring relatively fast, especially since every 10 seconds or so you have to feed/clean up/immunize/rest your digimon.  Even tamagotchi aren't this needy! But there must be a positive thing somewhere, right?  Well, yes, the game is amusing for about an hour, before you realize that it's just repetetive and doesn't pass off as an RPG, or an action game, or anything else for that matter.	-1
This was greatly disapointing, at the time it was released i was highly anticipating this game. Took some years later to get around to getting a copy, and it definitely wasn't worth the wait.  This is not worth even calling a game in my opinion. The fact you have to take your Digimon partner to the bathroom every 5minutes made me giveup my first game after a while of torturing myself and hoping it got better but kept getting more disapointed. If you don't take your partner to the bathroom it poops on the ground, and if you walk too close after he eats it. And the only way to clean it is for him to eat it(and it gets harder to avoid the more ''accidents'' your partner makes. Instead of a flash or something it makes you wait for your Digimon to use the potty. The character who is human don't ever eat or use the toilet(as far as i have seen), which is odd since your character is supposed to be a boy from the physical world, and your partner Digimon is supposed to be a digital monster(so you would think the reverse would be more likely).  So you are left with 2 options run to the bathroom to keep your partner from having an ''accident''  or let him have accidents and once he eats so many he'll digivolve into Numemon Who is supposed to happen to digimon who are poorly trained and don't have personal cleanliness(but if you train and still make a few accidents but always feed your partner when he's hungry he will still end up Numemon). And if your traveling to follow the story, it's hard to time it so you find your way to the next bathroom before the next ''accident'' occurs.  i will not buy or rent any of the next games, because this was such a failure. i mean do you train your dog to use the toilet, then watch him everytime he goes..?  AGVN should review this, i mean the game is not fun at all what i have played. The sims i'll admit the characters have to use the toilet occasionally, but it's a longer time in-between bathroom breaks and you can switch between characters when one is in the bathroom you don't have to watch and wait when you just want to play the darn game.	-1
Too many feedings and too many bathroom trips gets annoying fast. What did they put in the food-prunes?When on the training field,i often had to stop training just so my digimon could use the bathroom. Most of the time,my digimon didn't make it to the bathroom on time,resulting in a rather unsightly little pile. Another gripe is that my digimon evolved into the practically useless Numemon 98%of the time. I often let him get killed off until I got a digimon I liked. My advice is to rent this game.	-1
Unlike the other reviews, i was very disappointed with the game. I was very excited the the game game out.  Love the cartoon series.  I made the mistake of purchasing it before testing it on a rental.  I thought it moved too slowly and the battles with other digimon was unstimulating.  The only good thing i can say about the game are the graphics are excellent and the sound FX are okay.  Rent this game if you can before you purchase it - just in case you don't like it.	-1
seller refunded the money  shenmue is a great game wish i can replay it again	-1
I have a love-hate relationship with this game.  I've played it for hours and hours and gotten a lot of fun out of it.  But there are three things that I have done my best to overlook but cannot:  1.  That the thing is full of bugs!  Presumably this is because it was rushed to "press" to coincide with the release of the 4th STAR WARS film -- who knows?  But there are many times when your guy will suddenly die for no reason because you fell down some invisible hole, that kind of thing.  2.  Your lightsaber is absurdly weak.  In the movie, the Jedis lightsabers cut through those droids on Naboo like butter.  In this game, you'll be giving them three or four whacks.  That doesn't look right, and that's not all:  the droids can give you a vicious uppercut that will fling you back about 20 feet or so.  It makes for some absurd viewing.  3.  Back in the day I remember a couple of gamers who nicknamed this "Jumping Jedis."  Jumping challenges are par for the course with such video games, I guess, but the problem was the program's lighting, shadow-rendering, resolution -- or whatever -- was not good enough for such contests to be fair.  There's one fairly hellish sequence on Tatooine where you can't tell where your guy is, how far he has to jump, which way exactly he is facing, etc.  I think the game should have toned down all the jumping challenges until they were able to render the graphics with enough precision that you can tell where your effin' guy is on the screen.	-1
This game is Very boring, all you do is kill the andorids in your way (which is Easy to accomplish) and then your faced with a big robot(and you think that is the end of level 1 it NOT) then you kill more andriod then your faced with a bit space ship. This game reminds me of the old Mario bros games, where you walk foward and get to the end. I was excpeting this game to be more like Spyro with hiden rooms, challanging villians and clues to figure out this game is so NOT like that!!  Also my biggest Pet peeve about this game is you can not Save it at any time. You have to complete the Whole level before it will let you save your game. After playing for 3 hours and not finishing level 1, I unfortunatly died and was NOT allowed to save my progress. I had to start ALL over from the begaining. It took me another 4 hours to finish level 1 (after starting over from the begaining 50 times) When I finally finished level 1 I was FINALLY allowed to Save my game which SUCKS. If you get tired and want to save the game and come back later you CAN'T you'll have to finish the level before you can save it.	-1
The one word to best describe Shenmue is not "groundbreaking" its repetative. Talk to 50 persons to find the one with the clue to carry the game forward and when you get that, repeat! Action is sparse and senseless wandering is essential to the game. I HATE talking to EVERYBODY to discover that I have to go to meet someone the next night! To make things worse youu can't skip time so you really have to wait and wait and wait. The "Quick time events" are cool but too far apart to save this snooze fest. Shenmue got old after Disc 1 and went downhill from there. The graphics are awesome and the idea behind the game is cool but not well done. This game can put you to sleep faster than sleeping pills. The worst part of this game is working in the harbour for 5 days and having to do that stupid forklift race each day, yawn and tedious to the MAX. I have no desire to finish the game as you never face the bad guy, not even in part 2 you just keep walking and talking, walking and talkin, walking and talking (get the point of this game). If you like wasting precious life that could be used to live then this is for you...otherwise get a more fulfilling gaming experience elsewhere. Two stars for graphics and innovative concept.	-1
This game is one of the most time-consuming and frivolous games out there for the Dreamcast.  The missions are dull with hardly any decent action.  The one quest that stands out in my mind the most is one where you have to find Mr. Yakamoto.  You are given no idea as to where he lives and go door to door trying to find him.  It always happens that his house is the last you look at.  Another problem is the fact that many of the quests are given to you at one time and you have to wait 24 hours before you can actually do them.  There is no way to make time go forward so about 35 of the 40 hours needed to complete this game will be on waiting around for the place you need to go to open. This game is very disappointing and if you are somewhat interested in it, borrow it from a friend.  If you don't have any friends, then only dish out the $6 to rent only if you think you might like it.	-1
how can this game be good if you can not even control your fielders. So what i am trying to get to you is what kind of a baseball fan likes a game where the computer controls your fielders and not you. There are also other glitches in the game like sometimes in the infield your infielder runs in place before catching the groundball whitch results to the computer being safe on first. There is one good thing world series baseball 2K1 has good updated rosters for the 2000 season not the 2001 season. Also pitching to the batters can be fun but with all the glitches and not being able to control all your fielders drags the game down to a two. I really had high hopes for 2K1 to bad the game is not good.	-1
This game has some cool features--the batter/pitcher matchup is reasonably good; players are (except when they're sitting on the bench) very realistic-looking.  It also doesn't eat an entire memory card like NFL 2K--just a little over half of one. The bad news, though, is that there are some INCREDIBLY big problems with gameplay.  Number one: FIELDING FIELDING FIELDING.  The worst are grounders through the "gap" between first and second.  The first baseman is apparently unable to move even three feet to his right in order to snag the ball.  Ugly. Number two: baserunning. How many major-leaguers have *you* seen running on an infield popup with less than two out?  Play this game at all, and you'll see guys who get paid more than the GNP of some small countries making that very same bonehead move.  The player has to physically remind his baserunners to return to base on a pop-fly. These two very large problems are enough to really take a lot of the enjoyment out of what would otherwise be a very good game. There are some other problems, too: the little graphic that shows where the ball (tiny white pixel), defensive players (tiny blue pixels) and runners (tiny yellow pixel that is nearly indistinguishable from the ball) is almost completely useless. The fans in the stands look like something out of a Nintendo 64 game. There's no way to skip past the incredibly awful renditions of the national anthem at the beginning of each game. The replays aren't very interesting. The commentary is wooden and nowhere near as well-done as in, say, one of the excellent NFL games. The controls are not always very intuitive or responsive (especially irritating when you're frantically pressing B to get your idiot baserunners to return to base while they blithely jog along, finally realizing that Oh! You want them to DO something!).  These are all pretty petty little quibbles, really, and none of them would be enough to really make this a bad game by themselves, but when combined with the fielding and baserunning problems, the annoyances just mount and mount until you want to chuck your controller at the TV. (Barely) worth the $15 I spent on it used--for the graphics and to tide me over until WSB2K2 comes out in a couple of weeks.	-1
A total waste of time!!  Never has a game with such potential and mouth dropping graphics been soo horrible.  I got the game thinkin I could get atleast a little enjoyment out of what seemed to be a great game.  But as I began to play a little and realized how bad the game really was I started to wonder if it was the same game as shown on the case?  But after minutes trying to convince myself that the store had made a mistake packaging, I realized I made the mistake of buying the awful game.  No lie here, the worst baseball game to date, hands down. Just take my advice, stay away!	-1
I expected a lot from Sega as they have delivered on almost every account of the "World Series Baseball" series (no pun intended). Also with the Dreamcast finally deciding to show its true ability, I saw stills of this game and was in awe. This very quickly ended as I first played the game. Oh my god, yes the graphics are amazing. That is where it ends. Players are detailed and stadiums are replicated down to the upperdeck chairs. But this cant save the game. The control is quirky at best, batting is a real hastle. Hmm, perhaps defense will  be better. No, quite the contrary. There is absolutely no fielding whatsoever. The ball flys in the air and the computer moves a player to the spot then u decide which base to throw too. Sound like fun? Didnt think so. Lets go try another mode. HA! No extra mode for you! We are presented with exhibition and season. Oh well, lets try playing a season with some of our friends. Nope, cant play on the same team as a friend. With lack of extras, poor control and lack of it as well, and no team playing, this game avois a 1 star with its amazing graphics. This game is horrid to play and I strongly suggest playing Tommy Lasorda Baseball for Sega Genesis over this game. At least you can field....	-1
