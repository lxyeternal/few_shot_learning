works just like it's supposed to.	1
Great product but arrived with cleaner leakage. I figured I received 75% of that product. K&N makes a great product though. They may consider packaging it so it doesn't leak.	1
good	1
Perfect for your K&N filter or any cotton type reusable filter.	1
AS REVIEWED	1
A must for K&N filters...good deal...	1
There isn't quite as much "Oooga" as I was hoping for, but still fun. We have a old golf cart we use the putts around the neighborhood - this is a fun ad-on.	1
I do agree with Kkrome's very interesting review that the sound you most often get from this horn jumps up to pitch too fast. I found, with a little practice, that a relatively quick push worked better, didn't seem to get underway quite as easily. Of course the antique horns did the proper "ah-OOOO-gah" every time. I've had these put on two cars. (I'm no mechanic! I have Ziebart's guys do it.) The last time, it was put dead center behind the grill (in front of the radiator. My LAND is it loud when it is prominently placed like that. If you're wanting to use is as more of a "friendly greeting," I'd have it put off to the side or farther back. These aren't the most durable horns in the world. I had one on my 2005 (Toyota Avalon - people are VERY surprised to hear that sound coming from that car!), and after a year or two, the relay failed and needed to be replaced. Later, I had to replace the entire horn. I traded to a newer Avalon (left the horns on the other car) and got another in 2010. That one lasted all of 14 months before it rusted up and failed. I suspect its prominent location may have contributed to that, and would suggest placeing it where it's less exposed to moisture. In search of a more authentic sound, I replaced the failed one with a FIAMM ooga horn. That's been in only a couple of weeks, but for the record, the Wolo one sounds better. (Time will tell if it lasts any longer.) If the FIAMM lasts, great. If it conks out, I'll either check out another brand, or go back to Wolo.	1
Easy to Use.	1
Great price fast shipping	1
work very well	1
Easy to use, came out clean as new! Just be sure to follow the directions and don't over oil it!	1
This stuff is great. I use it every 3 months or so and my filter comes out clean oiled and ready to go.  So far I have gotten 4 cleanings. Probable have enough for a a couple more. Definitely recommend if you have any reusable air filter.	1
WooHoo! No more filter purchases! Just pull out the K&N filter, follow the cleaning directions, and you've got a new filter!	1
Cleaned up my filter good. Lots of cleaner left for another time or another filter.	1
Just as described. Love K&N products!	1
I love it...	1
Makes cleaning and maintaining K&N filters easy.  The right tool for the job.	1
The cleaner works super well & the oil coats the filter completely. It is suggested the process be completed every 25K-50K miles driven depending on driving conditions but I do mine about every 10K. It should take less than 20% each filter cleaning.	1
Easy to use, keeping filter clean for the power.	1
Heck of a lot better than paying my local oil change shop $20 to clean and re oil my filter.  For under $15 I can do it for propbably as long as I have the vehicle.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a K&N filter.	1
Makes your K & N like new, make sure you follow instructions.  Try not to get it on your skin, wear gloves.	1
Kit works well, be careful not to over oil as it is easily done.	1
Works great on K&N car air filter and K&N lawn mower filter	1
Love k & n	1
a must if you have the K&N air filters	1
Excellent Product.	1
it works....go easy on the oil	1
this product works very well and it saves time and money.	1
Very cool looking after its on,but before you begin,beware,you will waste the first 3 inches because of the way it comes taped together. I tried to save that part by using lighter fluid to get the excess tape residue off but didn't work. Pretty expensive for what your getiing,but I only wanted enough for the bottom of my rv doors,so the 1 roll did me fine.	1
Ordered the product, and was very disappointed.  It is "so" thin it is like using toilet paper and very cheap looking. Tossed it out and went to a automotive supply place to get some "Quality" stuff.	-1
I use k&n products for my automotive needs.  Looks professional and does the work needed to keep you going.  I recommend this product for cleaning your air filter or intake from K&N	1
great product.	1
Did a great job cleaning my K&N AF.  It was very dirty and now, at close inspection, looks brand new.  It may be psychological but truck seem to be running better/smooth.	1
loved it	1
works good	1
Same as described, good product..I love it	1
I mounted this according to the directions and it made a loud horn sound upon button pressing. If you buy this, you better like a horn.	1
It works, but quality is terrible. Mounting isn't exactly easy either. The air hose connection is on the bottom of the horns.	-1
Great product,work great	1
perfectly matches bumper	1
It's a bit brighter than the chrome I hoped to match, but it's easy to apply, and has a good finish.	1
Good job	1
Well, I'm rating this only on the known quality of K&N. I purchased this along with a drop in filter almost a year ago and have only put about 5k miles on my truck since. I wasn't sure if the filter would be pre-oiled or not. Turned out it was, so I really didn't need this and won't need it for at least a good 5 plus years. The price was cheap though and everyone knows that K&N is a top notch product, so it still gets the 5 stars it will ultimately deserve.  I Hope this review helps in your decision making process and please be sure to rate it if it did! Thanks for reading!	1
Considering that the short length, I would say it is a little pricey for the amount of material you get.  But, for my application, it is what the doctor ordered.  I needed something that was highly reflective and able to withstand high temperature, and this product is recommended for automotive application under the hood where it gets really warm.  I needed to create a light reflector that would increase the efficiency of a lamp set up that I have.  I used the self adhesive chrome strips to augment the pitiful output of the lamp. Since the sockets only accommodate mini-base bulbs (like candelabra bulbs) I could not find higher wattage than 60w.  The only alternative I had was to augment what I already have--thus creating additional reflectors.  This tape is very bright chrome and has literally double the reflected light!  Since it is high temperature tolerant, I don't have to worry about the ambient temperature around the bulbs themselves.  I am very happy with the tape's performance and it suits what I purchased it for.  I can highly recommend it.	1
This works great on the rear of my PT, lower rear back door. Need more for the sides to complete.	1
works great although the filter cleaner is just brake cleaner and degreaser. but the red stuff works great.	1
Works great and is cheaper than the local auto stores.	1
not sure if I really need this stuff	1
Just used this kit this weekend to clean the K&N filter in my 2012 F-150. Just follow the instructions that come with it and all will be well. Easy to use but just a bit time consuming while you wait for it to dry but I had other chores to do so it was no big deal to have to come back to this a couple times while it dried after the cleaning and then a 20 minute wait for the oil to wick on the last stage of preparing this.	1
Good price	1
Excellent.	1
Great product - easy to use.  I love this for keeping my filters serviced.....K&N is the best on the market.	1
I have K & N air filters on both vehicles I own and son's two vehicles. One set of bottles is lasting us a long time already to clean and re-oil the filter after say 25,000 miles. We don't go the 50,000 K & N says you can do. We keep our vehicles clean and maintained to well over 200K miles or more. K & N is an investment in clean air for the engine, better milage, and a saving in the long run over disposable air filters. Darn stuff just works!	1
As shown.  recharge for K/N filter.	1
This mirror works exactly as advertised and is relatively easy to install.  It fit right onto the exisiting window mount of my Toyota Tundra.  The only minor diffuculties I had installing the mirror was figuring out how to dismantle the dash, roof liner, and column trim so that I could run the power supply wire down under the dash and temperature sensor wire down under the dash and into the engine compartment.  Once all of that was figured out and the interior pieces snapped and screwed back into place, the installation looked clean and professional.  I was able to run the temperature sensor through the giant rubber o-ring with main cable harness that goes through the firewall.  Be sure to mount the sensor close to the front grill where it will get some air flow as I found out.  I didn't have the sensor mounted forward enough on my first attempt which resulted in high temperature readings when the engine got hot (>110 deg).  I relocated the sensor right behind the front grill, next to the headlight, and the temperature readings are always right on now.  The mirror itself took about 2 minutes to mount, running the wires took me about 2 hours.  In addition to the fine temperature and directional readouts, the auto-dimming works great - I am never blinded by headlights at night.  Overall it is a Great Product!	1
Same functions as the OEM Toyota mirror for almost $100 less. Easy installation too. Mine is in a 2008 Tacoma which uses the wedge mount as this is.	1
I have had the CIPA 36400 auto dimming mirror installed in my car for over a month and have had no problems.  The installation was as described in the manual and took about 1 1/2hrs.  The dimming feature works great.  The temperature and compass is easy to read in the daytime, and dims nicely at night.  I would recommend this mirror.	1
Worked as instructed.  I'll be ordering more.	1
Worked great! Looks like new, just be careful with your hands and/or high water pressure, you will bend the little metal grill on the filter.	1
great product will buy again	1
Industrial strength degreaser	1
I've been using K&N filters for years, in both my audi and motorcycle. This recharge kit is perfect for getting your filter clean and back to new condition. Wouldn't use anything else and for the price you can't beat it!	1
I would not recommend KN filters. I have had them in the past but never kept a vehicle long enough to have to oil. I have had my truck a few years not and tried oiling the filter. It was slightly due to the design of the filter but I ended up oiling it to much and had to trash a $90 filter and wasted the money I spend on the kit.  I was not willing to risk getting oil on my mass air flow sensor and costing me lots of $$$ to fix.	-1
Great Stuff	1
Installed this on our 2001 Subaru Forester as the original stock mirror was "bleeding". Works as described and no complaints.	1
Ive installed several aftermarket stereos in all vehicle types. The metra kits have never failed me. Great quality product at a fair price!	1
looks great and easy to install	1
Perfect fit to replace the OEM stereo in our 99 Silverado with a new Pioneer...  kiddo just has to have the aux jack and bluetooth!!  Worked well with no hassles...	1
It's a dash kit. It works. There's literally not much else to say. I was replacing a kinda jerry rigged flipout screen single din that I hated with a cheap pioneer single din. This made it look nice and clean installed.	1
1998 Chevrolet Express 3500 - Worked PERFECTLY!  Very pleased with how easy it was to use and how perfectly it fit.	1
I am enjoin this mirror, and it was easy to install too	1
Best $100 I've spent on my '04 Escape! Works magnificently and precisely as the factory dimming rearview mirror in my wifes Freestyle Limited! Compass is fairly accurate out of the box, supposed to self learn after a bit of driving. We'll see if it improves. Still looking for the best place for the temp probe as it's current location allows it to get warm from the engine bay, and reads 10 degrees warmer. Recommended product!  12-14 *EDIT* -  Temp now works GREAT! Just had to get the lead wires away from anything warm/hot as the wire can conduct the heat. The compass is spot on when checked against my navigation system compass. But the self dimming...Oh my! EVERYTIME a car comes up at night and rides on my rear, this thing pays for itself! HIGHLY recommended!  12-16-2017 *EDIT* - 2 years later, still working flawlessly! I adore this thing!	1
One of the best purchases that I made since truck was old enough not to have dimming, temperature, and direction. It installed cleanly on my 96 f250 and has worked great since day one. Love the temperature and direction on the mirror. Instructions where clear and concise. Calibrated easily by driving in big circle at the park.	1
This is the second mirror of this type that I have purchased - loved them both. Easy install.	1
Works as expected, cleaning the K&N Air filter is easy. Every 6 months is doable. Thanks Amazon	1
Good price	1
Service kit is quick and easy to use. Directions are clear. Will be able to get multiple cleanings out of the kit depending on filter size and how dirty it is. K&N filters and service kits will pay for themselves in no time!  Tip: If your cleaner sprayer top stops working or won't compress fully to spray, take the complete sprayer top off and soak it in a cup of warm water for a little bit and it will loosen the dried cleaner.	1
Awesome cleaning kit for k&n air filters. Good instructions	1
Works as expected. The cleaner is pretty stinky, but not an issue. Applying the oil with the aerosol can was pretty quick. Overall, you'll need this kit one day.  Recommended? Yes	1
perfect for the air filter. Will last a while.	1
Fit perfect and was easy to install. Seems pretty sturdy too.	1
Made the task of installing an aftermarket radio 100% easier.  I would buy this every time.	1
Good fit.	1
Worked great for install in my 1996 C3500.	1
A really nice add-on to your vehicle if it didn't come with a compass/thermometer. Works well and fairly easy to install.	1
Husband said it worked great. He's very happy	1
perfect fit. easy to install.	1
yes	1
Just as good as the factory units. The dimming feature works perfectly ... temperature and compass are great. Very happy ... would do it again. Install was not difficult	1
worked perfect for my install	1
wish the face cover was designed a little different. Made it hard to install with the stereo i have	1
Good value.  Easy to install.	1
Great product!	1
It sure make it easier to clean my filters.	1
sure...	1
Works good and pretty simple.	1
Good 100%	1
works perfect. good instructions	1
This unit was everything I expected in a rearview mirror.  The compass and temperature readouts are easy to read and the auto dimming works great.  An excellent unit.	1
great price, very easy installation.  works great.	1
Works like a charm. We now have 2 of these. My husband liked mine so much I got him one. Love the auto dimming at night. The temp works well. Not sure on install as we had it done by a friend who works on cars. He said it was ok.	1
This is the third mirror of this model I have installed.  Love it.  I installed one in my wife's car, one in a truck that I just traded in, and one in the one I just bought.  Love the auto dimming feature as it only darkens when you need it. The compass and thermometer is great addition if your vehicle doesn't come with such.	1
MAde installation of my new Alpine in my truck a snap	1
Great replacement mirror for failed OEM device. I wish it was available without the wiring harness and thermometer, as I reused my existing harness. For the price they should have included the adhesive with the mount. My OEM mirror used a twist off mount, so I had to use the included window mount.	1
I have a 2010 Hyundai Elantra that just had a standard rear view mirror and I don't have the outside temperature in my car.  The main reason I bought this was for the outside temperature display and not much else but after I had this put on I love the auto dimming feature at night, it's much better than having to flip up the mirror.  This dims very nicely when you have bright headlights shining behind you.  This also has a compass which is spot on and comes in handy.  The temperature is spot on because the temperature sensor was installed in the right place, by the front bumper away from heat generating components.  I finally have the outside temperature in the my car and it's awesome.  The compass and temp due automatically dim at night so they are just the right brightness, it's so seamless you don't even notice, basically it's the brightness it should be at all times, no issues.  This came with all the wiring needed and the button for mounting to the windshield if your car doesn't have the standard mount like mine didn't.  Overall I'm glad I bought this mirror, it gives my car a more high end feel and it serves multiple purposes so it's a winner.	1
Item arrived early as it normally does from Amazon. Installation was quite easy and simple. Pulled up a You Tube video of a similar truck where a guy used the exact same kit. Make sure that you bend the radio bracket tabs into the kit anywhere you can so when you slide your head unit in it will lock into place.	1
Just bought a used 2000 silverado.  Boy does this make installing a single din radio a breeze.  It fits perfectly and even used the OEM "rails" to mound the radio adapter to the car.  Nice product.	1
Custom install!!!	1
Worked well for my Astro Van..Had to use the sleeve that came with the radio as opposed to the side bracket method that was listed in the instructions. Radio I used was single din unit with no cd so it was alot shorter in depth yet that wasn't an issue with the install kit... only reason for 4 stars is you have to determine which method to install cause it gives no options in instructions. ..	1
Fast shipping and works great	1
Nice Cover but a little smaller than I thought	1
Perfect fit	1
AS ADVERTISED AND FAST SHIPPING	1
It could of have fit better. Although it will keep rain,dirt and dust off of the winch when its in storage.	1
Bought my wife a 2011 Kia Sorento and it didn't have a display showing the outside temp like her Altima had. After buying a 10 dollar generic temp display at Auto Zone only to have it break while installing it I hit up the internet to find something worth my time. This mirror looks like a factory installed item. Wiring was simple with the included instructions. Getting the temp probe mounted behind the front bumper was tricky and took some time and thinking. After drilling the firewall to get the probe through and taking the headlight and grill loose to get it to the bumper all worked perfectly and temp display is accurate with the thermometer I have in my house and also showed exactly the same temp as all the banks I drive past!	1
This mirror has been in my truck for a month now and its awesome. I've had vehicles with loaded mirrors before and this is just as good as OEM. UPDATE 3/21/14 LASTED ONE YEAR 2 MONTHS. MIRROR WILL NOT STAY LIT. BLINKS ON AND OFF AND FADES AWAY AS IT PLEASES. CONNECTIONS ARE TIGHT AND ALL WIRING IS CLEAR. MIRROR IS DONE. ITS NOW A 160.00 MIRROR THAT DOES NOTHING. worst part is I tossed my old mirror 2 weeks ago. DONT PURCHASE THIS MIRROR	-1
Once I figured out how each piece went, it was a snap. It snaps right into place in my 2000 tahoe NBS dash. Didn't need all the pieces that came with it which is why I initially had trouble trying to find a home for each thing.	1
The easiest install i have ever had with this. 2000 gmc serria.	1
perfect fit	1
My wife's new Honda Fit did not come with an outside temperature indicator like in her former Subaru and wanted it. Honda does not include it in the Honda Fit series. This product fit the bill. Compass and auto dimming feature a bonus. Installation should be done by a pro - tapping into the wiring harness is not easy.	1
Love it!!!!  I recently purchased a new 2011 Ford Ranger.  My previous vehicle had a self-dimming mirror, thermometer, and compass.  Ford wanted over $400 to install a similar mirror.  The CIPA 36400 is a more affordable solution at $159 through Amazon.  It is a high quality product.  It came with all the hardware to make a professional installation.  Instructions are very well written.  You need to know what you are doing before attempting to install this yourself.  Took about 2 hours to install. The most time consuming was feeding the thermometer sensor cable through the firewall.  Had to remove some items to get at the rubber access boot. Otherwise it was pretty straight forward.  Excellent functionality and looks great.	1
We have had this product since December 2009 and overall we are pleased with the purchase.  Build quality is superb and all features work as advertised.  The instructions that came with the mirror were spot on and were easy to follow and understand.  They should have included some adhesive for the mount though.  One problem we have encountered that others seemingly haven't is related to the weight of the unit.  We live in San Francisco and our roads are pretty beat up.  Potholes, ruts... you name it and we drive on it daily.  When you combine the weight of this mirror with the rough road conditions locally, the "wedge" mount on the windshield takes one heck of a beating.  Last month one side of the wedge broke off causing the mirror to break free and dangle helplessly.  Fortuitously we were driving by an auto-glass repair shop and got it fixed pretty quickly so there was no real harm done.  Anyway, this might be something to possibly consider when purchasing this unit.  Overall we like this product and have no qualms recommending it to anyone.  Pros:  Price, ease of install, features, clear and accurate display. Cons:  Weight, no mount adhesive included.	1
mirror is the same as others on the net that are charging a hundred dollars more for....easy install if you were born with common sense and works perfectly...	1
This mirror exceeded my expectations. It came with quality installation accouterments. Installation instructions were well written, easy to follow and complete.  Installation was straightforward and relatively easy.  The mirror just plain works.  It is very dark and darkens instantly.  The outside temperature and compass are accurate and easy to read without being instrusively large or overly bright at night.	1
great	1
excellent fit and has a factory look for 2005 gmc safari van,thank you	1
screws were not long enough, plan on possibly buying new hardware. you needed screws for two different applications to mount and both sizes on both applications came up short.	-1
Works well for the price.  I sanded down the edges a little bit, on the inner rectangle bezel to make it fit much better and look nicer.  I have this in a 2002 Chevrolet Silverado extended cab.	1
Worked well. IDK if the one i received was a bit off from the norm but it was REALLY tight trying to slide over my head unit. Ended up working though so i cant complain.	1
Fits 2000 Chevrolet Silverado Perfect.	1
Unquestionably the easiest and fastest 100% quality installation ever. I'll always look for Metra from now on!	1
Easy to install. .perfect fit..great quality.	1
Yep, it's K&N	1
good	1
I have a K & N performance intake kit on my truck, and my wife's car has a K & N performance air filter... K & N makes amazing filters that increase the horsepower and fuel mileage in your car, and they offer a lifetime warranty on their filters that will last 1,000,000 miles. I cannot recommend K & N enough. That being said, you do have to clean your filters every 50,000 miles, and the best way to do it is with this cleaning kit from K & N. Great price, it cleans the filters like a champ, and it keeps your filters and engine running smooth. Save money and save the environment by getting K & N filters, and keep them clean by buying this cleaning kit!	1
Saving money every time I use.	1
Great Product, perfect. Mahalo :)	1
Came in within a couple days works very well didn't know it would make such a big impact on the performance when you actually have it cleaned with this kit anybody should definitely invest in this it was recommended by a mechanic and I'm glad I went with this	1
Bought this at my local Auto Zone Great product easy to use.. Used this to cleane my K&N intake filter and man did this work wonders. I was originally looking for the oil that came out of a squeeze bottle but I think this worked better. The oil in this can sprays evenly across 2-3 pleats.. Keep Your K&N cleane !!	1
Keeps your filter working well	1
Awesome and cheap	1
Good	1
The oil did not spray.	-1
great quality plastic looks good and fights right on	1
Does what it is supposed to do at a decent price. Would recommend to anyone	1
Another great Metra product. The kit at the local Walmart would have stuck out from the dash and looked tacky. This kit on the other hand fit flush with the factory dash and compliments my new Kenwood headunit. Installed in a 1999 Chevy Tahoe LT	1
great.	1
Excellent price and quality!	1
ok	1
Good stuff	1
Shipped fast, great price	1
A must have for k and n high flow filters	1
GREAT....	1
excellent	1
It's K&N for a K&N - can't beat that.  Worked as expected.	1
Worked well to clean my cold air intake.  Was relatively easy to do.	1
Excellent kit for cleaning up and recharging the K&N cone filters! Must have for routine maintenance.	1
highly recommend when purchasing k&n products	1
Very hi quality.	1
Great product, fast delivery	1
Installed great and looks great. Good price and better quality then more expensive kits.	1
sent wrong product	-1
Simple install. Works.	1
I purchased this to put in a radio in my 01 Silverado 2500HD.  The instructions were a bit vague,the texture was a little off and there was some plastic flashing that needed to be trimmed but it worked well and simplified the installation.	1
This kit fit my Silverado perfectly. Snapped right in and no wiggle. I was a little disappointed by the texture as it doesn't match the smoothness of the existing dash so it is obviously after market. Other than that I am happy with the price and how it worked.	1
Worked very well. Cleaned my filter nicely.	1
What I expected	1
excellent...	1
good	1
Best I can tell it works. When I clean a filter it's collected a lot of junk but the cleaning solution gets it good and clean.	1
not much to review here.  It works for K&N filters.  I mostly got it for the oil.  For cleaning, Simple Green works just as well.	1
Speeds up installation, secures the stereo, makes for nice appearance in the dash.  I used it to install an Alpine head unit into a 2000 Chevrolet Silverado 2500.  Once the old unit is removed this slides in the same tracks and shapes into place.  There are two slide plates have their own track.  They screw to each side of the stereo and once they snap in place and slide into the dash, listen for two snaps and you're set.	1
We used this install kit to put a new radio in a 98 GMC Yukon.  All you have to do is mount the radio in this dash insert and it will snap into the dash the same way the factory radio did.  About as easy as it could be.  There are plenty of videos out there to show you how to get the dash apart to get to the radio.  Also, don't forget the wiring harness and antenna adapter.	1
Works fine.  Quality and price seem good.	1
love it	1
Best filter on market.	1
Factory sealed box with no signs of crushing.  No problems.	1
Always a good product, I use it on all my cars.	1
I needed to be able to clean and recharge my cone style air filter. It was very easy to be able to clean and reapply the oil on the filter.	1
it's okay	1
all good	1
Works wonders.	1
Great!	1
K&N products are always pretty good and this one is no different!	1
good stuff	1
i could not say enough about this kit and how awesome it is, they were perfect for the flush mount kit style to make both of my Full size GM trucks look awesome, my wife had a slightly different raized one. and as soon as she saw mine told me i had to get a 2nd kit for her truck and trade it out right away. they looked so good and matched the GM dash style. i won't ever buy scosche stuff again only metra brand.	1
I have a 1996 GMC That i installed an after market radio in, this worked well and fit like a charm,	1
This in-dash mounting kit worked very well.  It was a comparable price.  easy assembly.  I would recommend this product.  Shipping was on time	1
I have never used a cleaner for K&N filters so I am looking forward to using it. so it will take a few miles before I can give an honest opinion on it. have used the oil before and I love the Idea. It has worked well in the past. don't see why it should not still be great product now.	1
completely restored my  filter and will do so for the life of my car	1
works great with the K&N air filters.	1
I bought this kit to replace a 10 year old K&N recharger kit. The only thing that seemed to change is the packaging! Still cleans and works great!	1
Buy this if you have any K&N filters. The only thing you have to be careful is that you don't spray TOO MUCH recharge fluid on the filter after you've cleaned it.  Apparently I put too much and it made my MAF sensor to malfunction causing a CEL and dangerous engine stalls on the highway. I had to replace my MAF sensor (not cheap!) and went back to a plain paper filter for now until I learn to recharge the K&N with the correct amount of fluid.	1
purchased for 2000 silverado  The kit fits great and is easy to instal the confusing part is that there are 3 depth options for the headunit and the instructions are for several different kits (match the number to the one you order) and you have to play with it for a bit to figure out which depth option fits the stereo you have best; I went with the 'mid' myself. The most important thing: it matches the factory dash very well and is very sturdy (better then the other kit I had) - there are rails that suppport the back -- I just addded a bit of double stick tape to fill the gap a bit... and this kit fits flush with the dash --- it does not stick out like some do. worth the price.	1
There's not much to say about it, except that it works for my 99 silverado.  However I did not care for the printed instructions that came with it.  If I had not already watched a video on youtube about it I would not have gotten the part about bending the metal tabs back on the bracket that came with the stereo (maybe a duh moment, but hey, I had never done this before!).  In any case it fit, it works, it covers up the hole and it looks pretty good for what I paid for it.  I recommend going to Crutchfield or somewhere like that and looking up the part numbers for whatever adapter is needed for your vehicle, then come back here and purchase it because it's cheaper that way.	1
This cleaner and oil works great.  I recently purchased a motorcycle which already had a K&N filter in it, however it was extremely dirty from debris and soot.  This stuff cleaned it to look like new and I'm glad I only had to buy cleaner rather than a whole new filter.  I put K&N filters on all of my vehicles, so this is a worthwhile purchase to be able to clean all of them without worries.	1
If you have a K&N filter, you need this set of products to clean and re-oil your filter.  This is essential to continued efficacy of the filter.  This is the best price I have seen for the set, and saved me a trip to Autozone.	1
Not sure whether you really need it to maintain the K&N filters but they do recommend it and why take a chance with a good filter, cheap insurance.	1
I chose to buy this squeeze gel like air filter oil over the air aerosol can spray because it really absorbs into the whole filter itself and very thorough.  It isn't as convenient as spraying and takes more time to perform the work, but at least it sticks longer in the filter and that I don't have to recharge it for a longer duration of time.  Easy kit to use and I also use the filter cleaner on vacuum filters also.  It's very useful to me.  This oil type recharger is for the patient people only haha.  Because you have to apply it to every single wedge in the filter back and front.	1
If you have the rechargable air filter, this is a must to clean and re-oil the filter.  IMHO you can't go wrong with K&N products.	1
This kit really works to clean my air filter for my Harley and glad I got it!  Everything you need to keep my filter like new.	1
Used to clean and re-oil a K&N type reusable air filter. I was paying over $20 for the same kit at the auto parts store. No longer.  Amazon has the best price.  To clean, knock off any heavy dirt first. Then liberally spray the filter with the cleaning solution. Let it sit for 20~30 minutes, then flush with water from the clean side to the dirty side.  You want to flush dirt off the filter instead of deeper into the filter.  After you flush it thoroughly, let the filter dry.  After the filter is dry, re-oil it. Don't use too much oil, just make sure you don't see any white spots.	1
I purchased K&N filters for my cars and this cleaner cleans filter very well. Make sure you lay filter on top of paper towels to absorb excess oil. This will keep your MAF sensor from getting dirty with K&N Oil	1
This kit is exactly as advertised.  I washed my filter thoroughly with the soap, let it dry and then re oiled it.  Be prepared to spend a good amount of time and water washing it.  But the results are worth it.  Good for another 100,000+ miles.	1
This air filter recharger kit works well. It will be able to clean and re-oil your K&N air filters for a while, depending on how many filters you have.	1
for the past year I've been cleaning my K&N air filter with a water hose. I had no idea this recharge kit existed so I decided to grab one. It's insane how much dirt comes off of the air filter with this thing. This kit cleans way more than a water hose ever would. I put my air filter through 2 cycles since it had never been properly cleaned. Looked good as new afterwards.	1
The cleaner & oil is so easy to use. The cleanup & re oil is easy. The squeeze oil bottle helps with no over spray.	1
Kit comes with cleaning spray and recharger oil.  Easy instructions.  It just takes time and patience for the filter to dry after washing.  You also need to plan ahead or drop a temporary air filter in your car in the time being when you are re-oiling your filter.	1
I have used this twice now to clean and refill my K&N filter. Be sure to follow other's comments to avoid over oiling (I have not had that problem). A little oil goes a long way, and it's easy to see that the oil's in the mesh, once it's been cleaned.	1
works great thanks!	1
This recharge kit works perfectly with my K & N Filter.  I thought I was buying the spray oil, though.  And, this is a squeeze oil bottle.  It works fine though. Next time I will be sure to buy the spray oil.  It's just easier to use.  The cleaner works well and you will always use less cleaner than oil.  I'm a big fan of K & N air filters and I've had them with the last six cars I've owned.  The first thing I do with a new car is remove the existing air filter and replace it with a K & N.  And, when I dispose of the car I put in the original filter and then sell the K & N on Craig's List.  Unless it fits the next car I buy but that usually doesn't happen...	1
This is a great recharge kit for K & N filter. The only problem I have is it poision  and enviromently unsafe chemical contents. You must wear rubber gloves and use in well ventlated area. Alway dispose as toxic waste.	1
This is the second recharger kit that I have ordered and I can't complain. Works Great and I have no complaints,,,	1
K&N makes excellent high performance air filters and this is what they recommend you clean them with. I use this product on the K&N filter in my Mustang Cobra and also my Harley Street Glide. The cleaner does a great job of breaking down dirt and oil and the oil reapply is excellent on the gauze elements. I usually get about 4 cleanings and re-oiling from each kit. Keep your filters clean and your engines will love it.	1
good	1
The day after I used the pen, the paint cracked and turned brown.  Don't use this is you care how your tires look.	-1
does not work , smears and does not come out evenly.  way too much work to try to get it to work.	-1
I own two cars with K&N air filters.  I recently cleaned both filters using this kit and still have lots left over for future cleanings.  The directions are very clear and easy to follow.  Cleaning the filters didn't take long.  I highly recommend this product to anyone with K&N air filters.	1
Did what I expected.  Cleaned and recharged my K&N filter.  Instructions were tedious to read so I just took a few minutes to watch Youtube videos on how to do it.  Worked perfectly and was easy to do.  Next time I think I'll get the aerosol version.  It was too easy to over oil using the squeeze bottle (if you follow the instructions) which means you have to let it dry longer possibly overnight.	1
I bought my K&N not for the performance benefits but for cost saving since I won't need to by another air filter again.  This recharger kit is good for 8-10 uses (depending on your filter size) which translates to 4-5 yrs/bottle.	1
Very simple to follow directions instead of using an areosol can you use the squeeze bottle.  Simple and easy to do ..	1
I have an Injen cold air intake and an accompanying filter. I used the K&N cleaner to clean it and recharge and it's working great.	1
What to say about this stuff? The cleaner works very well and the oil is a must if you have a K&N filter...	1
it work very well,easy to apply,good product.i will recommend to anyone.good price too,it was delivery promptly and efficiently i liked very much.	1
I bought this cleaner kit to maintain the K&N air filter on my 03 Chevy Tahoe. The directions were easy to follow and very straight forward. After performing the full clean and oil my air filter looks brand new! Based on my first cleaning I suspect I can get at least five more uses out of this kit. Assuming I clean my filter every 20,000 miles this kit will get me through 100,000 miles of air filter maintenance.	1
It's what the company recommends and most people don't want to experiment with other products to see IF they work or not and take a chance on ruining  their expensive filter.	1
This is an K and N recharge kit with the Aerosol not the pour out style that works easier for the user. Great buy for less than what you would pay any where else for the same stuff. Well worth the price and shipping and receiving were simple and super fast. Thanks again Amazon.	1
Products work fine for cleaning and re-oiling the filter, but you will run out of oil long before you run out of cleaner.	1
I do not have K&N filters on my carbs, anyone that knows after market Volkswagen parts knows what EMPI is what is what I have. I used this product to oil my new air filters just because K&N is known for value and quality. Well it turned my cheap EMPI air filters RED! Which is just outstanding! Now when anyone sees my engine I get asked where did I find K&N filters that fit on a VW. Only shared with a select few so maybe they will be buying this product now as well.	1
I actually don't have any K&N filters, but other brand "re-useable" filters for my Harley and my Dodge Ram 1500.  This is priced right when compared to the other companies recharge kits comparable at $20+.  Works exactly like it's supposed to, simple steps anyone can do.  I won't hesitate to purchase this kit in the future.	1
This was 10 bucks cheaper at Amazon vs a local auto parts store.  If you use it properly and service your air filter as you should, you will not go wrong with this product.	1
Having K&N in all my cars, you gotta have it. It's not used much, but I clean the filters every six months. Works well!	1
I have owned K&N cleaning kits before but none of them had a aerosol can and this one just makes it so much easier.	1
Not much to say other than the price is cheaper than at a local auto parts store.  Product comes in K&N box with instructions.  Would definitely buy again for same price.	1
Need this kit with your K&N filter, so there isn't to rate about it. Buying was on amazon was cheaper than buying it at a automotive store	1
Good stuff!  I was never into after market stuff until, my two son got older and started buying all this after market for their 4 wheelers.  They never had any issues with the K&N filters, and service kits after they serviced them.  So I went along with the program buying the K&N filters as well.  I like them, and I would recommend them as well.  They protect more after the first few hours after being serviced.  The special oils catch a lot of unwanted particles yet, the engine has more breathing room.  :-)	1
nice filter, K&N is great in that you can order practically any size if you look long enough in their catalog.	1
This drastically reduces the resistance to air intake, and give a turbo that nice "whoosh" sound. K&N are easy to clean and are a trusted name. I have had Spectre's that were probably the same performance wise but for some reason don't clean as well, so I don't get the same life out of them.	1
Its great product plus iv received it on time and all the description do match the product. I will recommend it to everyone. Its a high quality and well made	1
Works as advertised, no issues, mounts up to 4" pipe no problem and looks great under the hood. Using on my modded 87 Buick GN with a S cover 60 series turbo	1
I have used K&N air filters exclusively for the past 15 years and they work great. The diesel engines use a lot of air and the air filters see a lot of bugs, dust , etc, so the air filters tend to clog quicker and really don't clean ups o well, so instead of reusing them, I typically replace them every 30 or 40,000 miles, depending on how dirty they become. No matter how dirty they become though, they are a big improvement over paper filters.. In my cars, they last about 100,000 miles before I replace and I clean them every 30,000. Mileage and power seem to be better than stock, but not as much an improvement as claimed by K&N..  Ken	1
Saved a few bucks while replacing an airaid filter.  Have used these filters in the past and have no bad input for them.	1
Simply the best product you can buy in air filters, I've been racing cars and motorcycles for 35 yrs and they all had the K&M filter on them. Amozon's price is hard to beat, if you think you can, good luck to you.	1
I drive a Mitsubishi Evo X, my open filter gets pretty dirty after only 13,000 miles and this product works as described  ! I believe I can get at least 3-4 times total since I use alot of the cleaner. Would buy again!	1
Good K&N Product. It is exactly what you can find in a parts store, but at a more reasonable price.	1
The kit cleans and treats the filter to keel it working as it should. Not much else to say about it.	1
all came to my entire satisfaction, I can recommend widely to make their purchases hereby, all my products came to my entire satisfaction	1
Bottles were bigger than expected (like pledge bottle size but a little fatter). The box was strong and in good shape. Products came on time (surprised with UPS lol). Wally World wanted same price for smaller ones. I would buy again. What you see in picture is what you get (aside from the K and N box).	1
this K&N kit works great for cleaning the filter and reapplying the oil. Ordered this one because the aerosol version can't be shipped to Hawaii....	1
got it within 2 days and couldn't be happier....cleaned my k&n filter right up and it was soooo cheap to buy	1
The recharge kit is pretty easy to use and seems to work as designed. I've never cleaned and oiled my K&N filters with anything else so I can't compare it to another product but based on the warranty from K&N, I think that's the idea.	1
Cleaned my filter out very easily.  Can be a little messy but that's the nature of the beast.  Just plan to put some newspaper down or lean it against a fence after you spray it while its working.  Brought back that new purple filter color fast.  Must have for an K&N owner.	1
I would recommend that everyone utilize this upgrade with the K&N CM-8012 air filter to their 2014 Can Am Outlander 650 X MR. It gives you a quicker throttle responce by allowing more air into the chamber for combustion.	1
Washed the filter on a Friday evening and the filter was dry Saturday evening.  Sprayed on the oil on Sunday afternoon.  Very easy to do on a 2008 GMC Sierra 3500 HD Diesel.  My main concern with the dealer doing it was that they might not have let the filter dry completely before re-oiling it.  How would I have ever known if it were done correctly?  They said it would take about an hour.  I don't know how the filter could have ever dried "naturally" as is required by K&N, in only one hour.  I'm glad I did it myself and I bet you will be too.  This kit will probably last for at least three recharges.	1
I like this product and would buy it again and again, very well made and saved me a lot of money.	1
The best you can get  The products speak for themselves.  I haven't owned a vehicle yet that I have not replaced the air filter system in.	1
Shipped in two days, great product, cleans and treats your K&N Air Filter. I use K&N filters on both my diesels and being able to clean and service them keeps my engines running great!	1
This is amazing stuff.  This is great stuff.  Pull the filter out of my 2013 Jeep and within min it was clean.  Love it.	1
I used this on my wifes 06 corolla I also have K&N filters in our motorcycles and my truck.  I've used this product for years to clean all sorts of reusable filters from foam to fabric.  Works great and I like that the cleaning solution is relatively un-offensive meaning that you can use it in the kitchen before rinsing the filter.  Good stuff, can't go wrong with K&N products.	1
This is a Great kit to have for any K&N filter . Makes taking care of your filter a snap.  Great for increased performance and saving a few bucks is always nice.	1
This Cleaner & Red Oil are needed for the K&N Filters.  Works extremely well.  The purchase will do two applications covering three years for me.	1
Have been using K&N air filters in all my vehicles for over 20 years. I feel there is an improvement in performance using the filter and it is so easy to clean, re-oil and use for thousands of miles. Actually do the service every 25,000 miles	1
Saved a fortune by buying the filter(on Amazon). Wash the unit with the spray cleaner & water and let it dry. Spray oil on till red color is solid. Pretty clean to do, and easy to save money.	1
If you've got a K&N, you need it and it's cheaper here than anywhere else. It takes about eight hours for it to dry, so plan on not going anywhere that day, unless you've got another filter to install. You should get two applications out of the kit.	1
This is a must for anyone who has a K&N filter. Use cleaner to clean out filter,dry and then oil and ready to go.	1
I have a 2000 Chevrolet Silverado that I installed the K & N system on when I first bought it.  I still have the orginial K & N filter after 184,000 miles and all I have done is clean it once a year with this kit.	1
yes, I can take it out clean it, re-oil it and put it right back in.  K&N makes some wonderful products and this is just one.  Shipment arrived in very good shape and on time.  Will definitely order more when needed.	1
WOW ! What a loud set of horns! I wanted something better than the whimpy horns my car came with. I saw these in a speciality auto parts store where they had them wired up, and knew they were the horns for me. The store wanted $180.00 for the set, and I almost got them because I was glad to be able to hear what they sounded like before buying, but I got on here, and of course they are a lot less. They were very easy to install, and get noticed on the road.	1
Been using K&N filters and this service kit for years.  Best way to save money on air filters.  Buy this as soon as you get your car and you will never need another filter again.	1
This kit makes reconditioning your K&N air filter a breeze when it's time to do so, and it keeps used air filters out of landfills!.  Steps to cleaning: 1.  - Spray on the cleaner. 2.  - Wait 10 minutes, then flush with water. 2A.  - Repeat if required. (may be required if you live in a dusty area or you have prolonged the cleaning time reccomended) 3.  - Oil the filter per instructions. 4.  - Let it dry. 5.  - Reinstall your air filter. It will now perform effectively like a brand new one again! 6.  - Keep the $25.00-$50.00 for a replacement air filter in your pocket.  I like saving money and having my cars get better gas mileage and perform well.  you will too!	1
Cleans filter element without harsh chemicals. Oil was easy to apply . For the $10 I paid buying this recharge kit, it should yield me 5 to 7 filter cleanings & oiling. That's roughly $150 in OEM air filter replacements. Money well spent!	1
Good stuff, easy to use , But will order the air  can next time . I think it covers the filter better	1
Good stuff if you are using a K&N air filter on any automotive or motorcycle engine. Works very good and is easy to apply. Just follow the instructions.  DS	1
Great style and loud! Able to alert other drivers to wake up and especially to get off their phones while driving! haha!	1
When you wire it with a relay directly from the battery the dang things are loud. A distinct sound. Definitely NOT a high pitched clown car sound. Not a deep Train horn. It has a raspy baritone sound. It will startle other drivers that are trying to merge into your lane right on top of you. These will give you an immediate horn with no delay. I mounted them in the front grill on my Ford F150.  I replaced the plastic wolo trumpet horns with these because the the air pump has a delay and the lousy plastic tubes are cheap.	1
Large 6" dia each,& heavy, requires 20amp relay, fuse or better and probably mounts. In modern cars they can be very difficult to mount but are better than air horns.	1
I purchased this horn set for two reasons.  First, as a motorcycle rider I am always looking for ways to be seen and heard.  Obviously the first reason is to be heard as these are LOUD!  VERY LOUD.  They are electric automobile horns and easily fit on the motorcycle.  Make sure you wire it correctly with a 30 apm relay or you will burn up your horn switch.  Secondly, I wanted something chrome and shiny to add to the look of the bike.  These look great.  I did not want horns that look like every other set you see on a bike... I wanted a clean, classy look that was functional.  There are other horns out there that would sound great but just look weird on a bike.  Buy It!	1
The kit makes cleaning the K&N filters so much easier and cuts through the grease and grime better then average soaps without leaving a residue behind.	1
Must have kit for cleaning my K&N filters. I usually check the filter every 3 or 4 oil changes and if it looks dirty, I use this kit to clean and re-oil regardless. The cleaner it is, the more efficient the engine is running.	1
Great cleaning kit for your K&N filter I purchased this one since my other kit ran out that I had for several years now. If you have K&N products this is a must to keep your machines filters clean and keep your machines running good with out engine problems.	1
It is not the neatest process to clean using this.  There is work involved in terms of proper use and clean up.  However, it does the job and my air cleaner was cleaner after use.	1
This is the best filter to have installed in cars, trucks or bikes. Since they last so long, this kit is a must	1
This is a great kit so you can keep reusing your premium air filter. Don't forget to read the directions or watch the video on the K&N website so you clean and oil your air filter properly!	1
When I use this to clean and re-oil my filters, I'll let you know, BUT K&N has never let me down and I've used their products for many years now and they make top notch slop!	1
Does what it exactly is suppose to do. One of the bottles cleans the air filter and once the air filter has dried, the other bottle lubricates the filter for the next use. Would recommend	1
I am concerned by some reports that oil could come loose and infiltrate the mass air sensor. There are millions of these around so if there was a major problem it would have come to light by now.	1
Needed this product since I bought a filter for the car...will keep the filter operational...am happy with the product..The filter will last a long time thus reducing the amount going into a landfill	1
So far so good, I've had the K&N filter for a couple years, taking care of the filter is a breeze!.	1
Great price for the recharger kit.  We really enjoy our new air filters. They clean up really easy and dry fairly quick, I tilt mine.  Add the service kit recharger and you are back in business.  I personally do one car at a time so that if I need to go somewhere I am able to.	1
Made by K&N for K&N.  What can I say? It does what it is supposed to do and it does it well.	1
handy little kit to keep the filters running good. simple directions and easy to clean. this is a must for anyone using these cold air filters	1
It fits perfectly. It works brilliantly. Years after I installed it, still no need cleaning, most big debris fall right off and it's clean like new on the other side.	1
For my ATV I purchased the K & N air filter. My old foam type needed to be replaced. After using the K & N filter (which works better - both performance and cleaner) I needed to wash and re oil the filter. Since it's a K & N I wanted to use the K & N "recharge kit" which is designed for this filter. It was fast to clean and re oil unlike my foam type which took 2 days to dry out completely. I do live in the desert, but it only took about 3 hours to completely dry then I could re oil the K & N air filter. Note that if you do use the K & N air filters, be careful not to over oil them. I know some of my friends have had problems with the fuel injected systems that the mass air flow sensor fails if oil get on them. I don't have this problem because my ATV's engine is carbureted. I have carefully checked to make sure this air filter does keep the air clean, and found that it does. It's easy to see when you need to clean them. Just look to see if the red oil is changing to brown. I clean mine every 2 trips which I put almost 50 miles per trip in the dirt (which does get very dusty). Should you get a K & N Air Filter, buy this kit too.	1
If you own a bike this is exactly what you need for your K & N filter. It works,and let me add very well.	1
I opted for the environmentally friendly version of the service kit, and like it quite a bit.  I feel like I can get a more precise application onto my filter and waste less product.  I hardly use any, and get a very good application each time I use it.	1
The cleaner/oil combination works really well.  The cleaner did a great job in cleaning out the filter and after putting on the oil, the filter looks brand new....I also notice a slight difference in my car when I hit the gas....	1
Works good on K&N products but also any "cloth" airfilter could be "recharged" with this stuff.  I have used it several times on my pickups intake, and it makes the filter good as new.  Give it a good cleaning with an air hose thou... makes the oil work better if its not competing with big clobs of dirt and grime.	1
I haven't had the filters long enough to use these products.  If they work like the filter, they should work fine.	1
if you ever owned a K&N filter it is great ,and it will be the last air filter you will buy and you can feel the difference in the engine ,it worth the extra you have to pay all my jeeps and motorcycles have them and they are easy to service with the filter care kit	1
This product does exactly what it says. The pump solvent makes cleaning a snap. The squeeze bottle oiler is easy to use; I can't imagine using the spray.  A mechanic pointed out that my filter was getting dirty and asked me if I wanted to buy a paper filter to use as a temporary replacement while cleaning it. I told him how I do the servicing quickly: After washing the filter and draining as much water as possible, I set up a small household fan, point it vertically, set the filter on top and turn it on. The gentle breeze has the filter dried within an hour.	1
Works great, just as described.  Fast, easy & saves a ton of money on replacement filters.  I recently purchased the intake system since the K&N products work so well.	1
I just used it since I bought it and my K&N cold air intake looks just like new. Remember to follow the instructions and it will save you time and product	1
I decided to clean my air filter after 50k miles of heavy use. It was easy, and the cleaning chemical didn't smell bad or anything (maybe a faint ammonia smell).  I made the, in hindsight, poor choice of doing the cleaning inside my bathroom shower, since it was the middle of the night. It turned out that my filter had dozens of huge bees and other insects trapped in it, and they got stuck in the drain. Next time, I'll definitely do the cleaning outside. Also, there was a pretty significant river of mud coming out of the filter, for quite some time. I ended up doing 2 full cleaning solution+rinse cycles, and called it good enough after that, though it probably could have used at least one more cleaning cycle.	1
I should get about 3-4 cleanings out of this set and the product does a good job cleaning out the filter from bugs and dirt. The instructions were pretty clear except for the fact you only use the oil on one side. After oiling the first side and just one ridge on the other side it was clearly over lubricated and I stopped at that point. I would purchase these again.	1
I bought this product because they won't ship the aresol to Korea, Im think its a good alternative but its hard to sqeeze the product on the filter evenly.  Even with that I would recommend this product to those who cant get the spray can.	1
Makes the life so much easier when servicing the air filter, just wash and spray. I would recommend this cleaner and oil for anyone that has a K&N filter.	1
I have a 2010 GTI with Stage 1+ tuning from APR. I have a APR Carbonio intake and with 20k on it since the intake installation I figured it was time to clean and re-oil the filter.  I removed the filter, sprayed it down with the cleaner as instructed and waited 1-2 minutes. I then sprayed it off (from the inside out) and watched all the grime and nastiness run all over my driveway. I made sure all the cleaner had been rinsed off and that the filter looked as clean as possible. I shook off as much remaining water as I could and then just left it sitting in the sun so it would dry out naturally. I checked it now and then to shake off excess water that had run down the filter and also turned it a few times so the sunlight hit all sides evenly.  After it was totally dry I sprayed a nice coat of oil onto the outside of the filter as evenly as possible without over saturating it. I bought the aerosol oil delivery kit because I thought getting even distribution would be easier this way. I've used the other delivery method...this was much easier.  Next you just need to let the oil sit and "wick" for 10-15 minutes and you are safe to reinstall and put it all back together! During waiting periods with the filter I took that time to clean out other hoses and fittings and fully wipe down the carbonio "box" to keep that clean as well. Everything worked perfectly and this is better than buying a $40 replacement filter.	1
I've cleaned my K&N filter numerous times over the past few years (typically as recommended (every 6mos)).  The cleaner does a good job cleaning... and the oil does a good job recoloring the filter back to that K&N red.	1
I bought this kit to try on an intake filter on my Yukon XL before buying a new filter, The red filter I have on my truck was black from all the dirt and debris, now after using this kit, it is red and looks nearly new again. also much cheaper than buying a new filter.	1
This recharger kit is necessary for the K&N Filter. This probably the best price I was able to find for this product. I will buy it again when I need it!	1
You buy these filters to avoid having to replace them, so you need to take care of it from time to time. Cleaner was very easy to use, impossible to get that wrong. The oil takes a little more skill and can get everywhere if you're not careful. Definitely put down cardboard or something to do this over, it may end up looking like a crime-scene afterwards from all the red oil.  Overall I was pleased with the outcome.	1
This is necessary to have if you have the K&N filters and I have three of them and live in a rural area so they tend to get very dirty fast. So I use this regularly.	1
Easy to use. Spray it on, rinse from the inside out, let dry, spray on oil. Its that easy! Woo!	1
The only product to use if you have a K&N filter.  I've used this kit for years and it helps a lot.  Shipped on time and at a great price.	1
Works good came in on time and no complaints got what I wanted  for the price its a good product better then the squeeze bottle	1
Easy to use and works well, filter looks new was surprised how clean it came. Good price through Amazon cheaper than anywhere else I looked.	1
I was skeptical of how effective the squeeze cleaner would be, but it really does its job! It even has a notch on tip of the squeeze bottle to ride along the crimps of the filter. Another top-notch K&N product.	1
I have changed over most of our vehicle to the K & N Filter Kits and this cleaner and filter oil work great.  It is evident how much it collects each time I clean it.  I clean it about every three months in my truck and twice per year in my ATV & motorcycle.  Have the cold air set-up on the truck and there is a noticeable difference in sound and performance.  If you have an average MPG reading on your car or truck, you will notice a decrease when it is time for a cleaning.  The K&N Oil does a great job catching the dust and smaller stuff while the Cleaner spray devolves everything and the filter is ready for afresh spray of oil!  Love it as it has to prolong the life of my engine with the grit it collects.	1
So a paper filter is roughly $15, that you have to change every 3-7000 miles depending on your vehicle and if you like to keep up on maintenance. Add it up over 100,000 miles and you've spent a few hundred dollars. Or you spend about $50 (less if you find one on eBay) for a reusable K&N filter that you can use for the life of your vehicle, then you spend $10 for this cleaning kit that will last you 2-3 cleanings/oilings. So now you've only spent $60 (or less) for every 100,000 miles. Plus you get that little bit of added throttle response from the better performing K&N filter. Well, I don't know about you but I know what I'm currently using, and will continue to use, on all of our households cars.	1
fits my motorcycle perfectly	1
Louder and more reliable than my stock horn was. Fairly small so fits in easily.	1
my husband really likes the service kit  he loves the filter and will buy more if needed from the same place	1
If you put in money to get a K&N air filter, it only makes sense that you should shell up a few extra dollars to get this kit as well.  The key to having and using a non-disposable air filter is the ability to clean it, and re-oil it.	1
Works exactly as it is listed, we have had no problems with it. We would recommend it to others and would buy it again if we needed to!	1
cleaned my filter just like it should. really wish they would put the oil in a spray bottle, it would make life sooooo much easier.........	1
required if you use a Kand N filter. Great product, cleans well, lasts for a long time. Good price, will buy from here agian.	1
I've be using K&N for many years and all there products work well and perform very well. You well never have to buy another filter.	1
Used this before & it cleans good. You don't need to over do it with the oil. Make sure the filter is completely dried before applying.	1
You'll save money over time with K&N filters and they breathe better than stock filters. Buy this product when you get your filter.	1
I purchased a used Yamaha motorcycle with a K & N air filter on it. I wasn't familiar with how these worked, but I have to say that I'm impressed. I watched the you tube video on how to use this kit. I am a real fan of K & N filters now.	1
K&N makes great air filters, and this kit is extremely easy to use to keep the filters working in top condition. The process of washing/degreasing then recharging with oil is simple. You just need to leave yourself some time to let the filter air dry (don't use air compressor to dry - you might damage the filter).  My only wish was that these kits were a little less expensive for what they are.	1
I installed this on an antique motorcycle.  Originally the bike didn't have any horn, you had to buy a handlebar mounted squeeze-bulb type horn.  This is small, loud, and seems to be well made.  It attached very easily and works without needing a relay.	1
The first one I put on my bike worked 3 times, then died. Fortunately I discovered the problem in the garage while testing it before taking my bike in for inspection. The second one I put on my bike worked about 5 or 6 times then died. Unfortunately, I NEEDED my horn while on the road to alert a confused, inattentive driver. Not the best time to find out. Don't waste your money on this cheap piece of junk.	-1
My company ordered a couple of these for use in our prototype motorcycle.  It was easy to install and is sufficiently loud for a motorcycle.  The horn uses simple 1/4" FASTON style connections for easy installation, and comes with a mounting bracket.	1
Very nice horn. Well made and is very loud.	1
worked great	1
works great on my motorcycle. very compact and decently loud.	1
Works well as long as you follow the instructions. I purchased two K&N filters so I can have one to use while the other one is being "recharged". This way, I can take my time to make sure the filter dries properly after cleaning and also have enough time for the filter oil to evenly soak in. Of course you can do this with a spare disposable filter as well. This is a must have item for K&N filter users.	1
All my vehicles have K&N filters.  You really need this kit to maintain your filters.  Highly recommenced for servicing the filters.	1
This makes cleaning my filter easy and quick. I would recommend it to anyone using a K&N filter. I ride a lot in the sand and it really helps keep the sand from getting through the filter.	1
What can I say except that it is of K&N quality.  It renews my filter at about a quarter the cost of a new paper filter and is superior in performance.	1
Even if put on sparingly and allowed to sit,  some of it still leaks onto my bikes engine.  Works good though.	1
Works well , no issues does what it says and worth the investment. I will be purchasing another kit in another 90,000 miles. Also works well on lawn tractor and other cleanable filters.	1
This kit does a superb job of cleaning and restoring your K&N Filter to like-new appearance and functionality. Well worth the price and effort.	1
Works as intended, the cleaner cleans most of the junks out of the filter, however it WILL require more than 1 try (took me 3).  Make sure you let the filter to dry completely, you don't want to mix the filter oil with water! One thing I find the instruction unclear is how much is enough. Too little oil will make the filter ineffective, too much might shorten the lifespan of the spark plugs.  Overall, it's a great refill system, I can tell the car can breath much freely after the 10000 mile interval.	1
Beep beep,works great.	1
nice load horn but found same horn for 1/2 the price. took a week to get though that was long. compared to the other one i got for less 2 day shipping	1
Great product, great price	1
Quite loud horn, there is also a screw for tuning the loudness. Really easy to mount.	1
Love this little horn. Easy to install and loud	1
Yeah it's small, but not really that loud.	-1
my filters is nice and clean simple to use got it at a good price cant go wrong with this kit	1
It cleans all the K&N filter products nicely and restores them to a like new luster.  Have yet to clean my 6 month old filter in my Civic Si, have used it regularly on the YZ250F	1
I put about 55k miles on my K&N panel filter before cleaning it out.  If you follow the instructions on the box, you'll be fine.  I did the rinse with the garden hose twice, and sprayed the cleaner on it twice, but other than that, works just like it should.  Brought my filter back to basically looking new.	1
I have used this product for about 4 years now and it is a good value for the price and easy to use	1
This what you should do instead buying new filters. The cleaning steps are very easy and also when applying the oil on the filter	1
This stuff hasn't changed.  The forumla and process has been around for ages, and works the same each time.  My motorcyles air filter is very exposed due to the hypercharger, and it needed cleaned stat.  Ordered this kit and washed, cleaned, oiled, and dried to perfection.  Order yours today!	1
This is a greatcar product for all cars to keep all running better, get your K&N filter to go with it	1
Have not yet used this, but good to know when I need to clean my filter the stuff is there n ready.	1
Loud	1
A mouse fart in the middle of a hurricane would be louder than these.	-1
Horn is loud as indicated in description.	1
Didn't work right out of the box, so I returned it for refund. UPDATE:  After I had returned this horn I found that there was a problem with the wiring harness I was testing it on. The horn PROBABLY was OK, so I changed my rating from 1 star to 4 stars. Sorry for the misinformation.	1
Nice little horn. Easy to install.	1
decent.	1
Great quality	1
Super loud. Exactly what I needed on my old Honda.	1
I have K&N filters on all my cars and I needed this recharge kit to clean and keep my cars running smooth.  This kit worked great and looking forward in keeping my air filters clean with this kit.	1
I ordered this for a friend. I don't have the faintest idea if its any good. It seems expensive to me though.	1
Good enough to get attention on my motorcycle.	1
As Advertised works Good	1
It is loud but "tinney" sounding.	-1
perfect fit, makes trail riding so much more enjoyable being able to honk to get people to move out of the way	1
Loud	1
Was an excellent replacement horn for my motorcycle. Works well honk, honk.	1
My new filter isn't dirty yet, so it may be a while before I do :-)  I have used K&N products for over 40 years and have always been happy with them.	1
Got this kit to service the K&N Filter I bought last year for my Sporty. Now I Have a Dyna with a K&N filter, so this kit will do double duty. Can't Beat K&N !!	1
Cleaned filter with cleaners around the house...then sprayed with this cleaner and WOW. All the dirt that was missed came out with a simple rinse!!! Never use stuff 'round the house again!!! Great stuff!	1
I tried to do this recharge on my 2006 honda accord 2.4L every 3 oil changes, and so far it works like a boss. can't ask for more.	1
I have reusable air filters on all my vehicles.  This system makes it so easy to clean them: 1) Remove the air filter from the vehicle 2) Thoroughly treat the filter with the cleaning solution and set for 10 mins 3) Hose the dirt out from inside the filter (repeat steps 2 & 3 for really dirty filters) 4) Spray on the filter oil and set for 20 mins 5) Re-install the filter  One thing I found difficult is that it's hard to tell how much oil to use.  Too much causes the filter to remain soaked and not allow proper airflow, too little allows dirt and contamination to get into the intake.  There's also plenty of solution and oil to provide for several cleanings.	1
its loud and cheap. works fine	1
Honk Honk	1
It works and its loud	1
havent used the dripper can yet but the aerasol works well, little overspray but is easily wiped up. i actually use this on a SLP air filter on a pontiac G8, works just fine.	1
This is the fist time I've used this product.  I think I will get about five or six rechages out of it. You do need to give yourself plenty of time for the filter to dry.	1
its good for the kn filter, but the direction is not say very detail, so the first time i use it, waste a lot but still not make it red enough. a little bottle.	1
I'm running a K&N filter on my GL1800 and a couple ATVs. For those of you who have changed the air filter on a GL1800 you know how much of a pain it is so the extra mileage you can get from a K&N filter over the stock OEM filter is a nice upgrade. This filter care kit is a convenient way to clean and recharge a K&N filter when the need arises.  I would recommend this product.	1
Good products	1
These work just like they are suposed to work, a great product that is well worth the money, I love it.	1
Just what is needed to take care of the K&N air filter. Easy to use (a little messy, though) and does what needs to be done. Do yourself a favor and go to the $1 store, buy the largest aluminum throw-away roasting pan you can and clean the filter in it. Saves a mess to clean up.	1
This kit comes with Power Kleen cleaner in a pump spray and filter oil in an aerosol can. The filter has a 1 million mile warranty, and recommends clean & oil every 50,000 miles under normal conditions, so the kit should last a long time.	1
K & N filters are worth the time and effort to clean and re-oil them.  My filter is thinner than the paper version so air gets into the engine with less obstruction, even when its dirty.  I can get up to a mile per gallon better mileage over a paper filter.  They clean easily with the solvent in the kit, and re-oiling is quick.  Big caution - don't over-oil the filter.  A light coat is perfect.  As long as enough has been applied to see pink on the opposite side after 5 - 10 minutes, that's all you need.  Overdoing it may impair your engine (could foul the plugs) and cuts down air flow.	1
Works as advertised. I followed the instructions exactly and it seemed to do a good job cleaning my filter. It's cheaper here than in the store.	1
This is a must have kit to keep your K&N filter. Very easy to use. Well packed, on time, great purchase	1
You need this set to maintain your K&N filter.  It's available at my local auto-part store but I rather ordered it with my new K&N filter.  It will restore your filter to factory new condition.	1
This works just as it should, works great! Anyone that buys a K&N filter will need this might as well get it at the same time.	1
Came in nice containers and will be easy to use when I need them! Do you want more? What can I say?	1
If you have a K&N, eventually you're going to have to clean it.  This kit works well, and I prefer the squeeze kit to the aerosol as I find it more precise with less waste.  Not a glamorous bit of kit, but a needed one for your filter.	1
Works just like my stock horn on my DRZ400SM. Tiny bit smaller and maybe tiny bit lighter. Not any louder.	1
This is a really neat little horn with a big sound. I bought two, one for my Kubota B8200DT and one for my Cub Cadet 1650. The kids love blowing the horn on the little tractors.	1
Not any louder than a stock horn. Not worth the time it took to wire.	-1
Works great	1
great sounding little horn	1
A must if you get the filter. Only the best way to clean and re oil the filter. Would recommend highly	1
After 30,000 miles on my Kn filter i felt like it was time to wash and clean for better performance. I see now why this kit is so important. it first washes away all the old dirt and oil. Then the spray oil relubes it back to new condition. The kit comes with easy instructions and arrives within 6 days. Solid easy buy!!	1
Great filter for K&N as usual. I have used them for years in all my vehicles. Recommend K&N products to all.	1
It works well to clean and recondition my K & N automotive air filters on all three of my vehicles. Don't hesitate to buy a K & N air filter for you vehicle!! They may seem a bit expensive up front, but they easily pay for themselves!!!	1
Awesome! works great! the only thing to make sure it the filter must be 100 % dry before you put on the pink oil solution. do not put too much, it will come through to the other side of the filter. make sure you got some paper towel under it!	1
Read data on the bottles and sounds like I bought the right cleaner for my K&N filter.  Not needed to use yet but know it was the right type of cleaner and oil to buy.	1
Affordable, small, and loud. Replaced the broken stock horn off my Yamaha TW200. Plugged right in. It looks and it would also work on my Suzuki SV650.	1
Works well for me.  Installed easily in my application (on a quad).  Comes with a ground jumper and terminals for crimping/soldering.  It doesn't have a gigantic current draw, so it can be wired directly to most horn buttons without using a relay.  Sounds pretty much like a horn on a scooter or smaller motorcycle.  This horn is not internally grounded so you can wire it to either sound with the horn button supplying B+, or by grounding it.  There are two spade terminals and the mating open barrel crimp connectors are supplied.  A already assembled grounding jumper is also supplied.  Great value.	1
A fine replacement for my original 81 Honda CM400T horn...	1
GREAT LITTLE HORN. It tells people your there and it has a tomne that kinda tells people your not very olarge	1
Horn is low profile and fits the bill for getting quads street legal!	1
Replaced the horn on my SV650 with this after the stock unit died.  Seems to work well - decently loud, attention getting tone.  Time will tell how durable it is.	1
Perfect for ORV's,  works great.	1
If you have a K & N filter, you need this cleaner.  Otherwise, the garage will order it and charge you a whole lot more (and unless you ask for the leftovers, you'll get charged for only one use of a kit that contains 4 or 5 applications).  Be smart...take this to the mechanic when you need your filter cleaned if you don't do it yourself.	1
Personally I love the spray can vs other bottle. Have used this set for years and i love it. Sometimes i worry about it being too wet ..	1
Worked perfect	1
Beat the snot out of it the first day I used it. Held up great and feels solid. Used on warn xd9000	1
Great product and description, definitely coming back to buy again	1
perfect replacement.	1
just right	1
Fixed my old winch	1
The product works just as described.  Because my filter was very dirty, I did have to spray twice and flush with water several times. I like the squeeze bottle of oil instead of a spray because of ease of application and no over-spray.	1
The filter is re-cleanable with this kit. No point buying the filter if you plan to not buy the cleaning kit.	1
K & N always puts out a quality product. The recharge kit works great to clean and re-oil the filters !	1
Works great with my K & N filter. I really like the squeeze bottle for the oil. Works great but you can over do it, if you're not careful.	1
Works well.	1
Works perfect. Great OEM replacement for lost controller.	1
Replaced my original remote that was damaged when I loaned it out. Works perfectly. Used on my Warn M8000	1
exactly what I needed.  Good quality and arrived just before I needed it.	1
EXCELLENT PRICE AND PRODUCT/WILL USE SELLER AGAIN	1
works great	1
It goes BEEP!	1
Great	1
Horn is mounted and wired and sounds like a metric motorcycle. Put it in my Commander XT to be street legal.	1
Loud horn.  A bit heavier than the cheaper Wolo horn, but much higher quality in my opinion.	1
works great its small size makes great to add to 4 wheeler thank you	1
have not try this cleaner... as my filter and car is pretty new. will try it when i hit 20k km	1
My car and truck were both really running like crap... figured it was time to wash and recharge the filter. I sprayed it with their, basically soapy water, and waited a while as the bugs and gravel dust was loosened, and then rinsed it in the sink until clear. I let it dry in the sun for a few hours while I found something else to do, then sprayed the oil as if I were spray painting something... follow the instructions, don't want too much oil, don't want too little either. My Neon doesn't care if I over oil it, but my truck has a mass airflow sensor, it does care... it cares a lot! Under-oiling it causes the fine mist of gravel dust through the filter, too much clogs it quickly and I guess that's better than it going into the engine but the MAF Sensor gets coated with the oil and that will cause performance issues that the filter may have given you. It's a fine balance!	1
Use this for my K&N Air Filter for my Nissan Titan.  Got a few more horse out because of the K&N.  Oil filters good too.	1
this stuff works great.  I just used it last week to clean the filter on my bike.  much better than buying new filters!	1
The product matches the description.	1
I bought the easy to use aerosol recharger kit. Cleaner works well too. Easy, simple, save time and hassle. Great product.	1
The power cleaner cleans well and sprays well, and the oil sprays nice and evenly. I just washed my filter in the sink...probably shouldn't have, but I did.	1
I only wish that the oil was sold separately. I don't like the cleaner soap provided. The K&N filter system is a great idea for saving money if you plan to keep a vehicle long term. I have never seen a performance improvement verses a "clean" factory paper filter but this one is cleanable and if properly oiled will protect your engine the same as a paper one.	1
Works as advertised.  Made of a durable plastic with a nice coating.	1
I have a 1983 model so I had to change the plugin to . The old style was not available but everything works like new .	1
perfect fit	1
Perfect.  Exactly as described.	1
Bought a jeep with a winch and no controller.  This works perfectly and is long enough to get you out of the way of harm.  Stores small enough.	1
This kit made my 5-year-old K&N filter look like new. And it took only a few minutes with very little effort.	1
Use this product to recharge your K&N air filter.  I don't know of any other product I could use to recharge my filter.	1
this stuff cleaned my intake filter like a charm! next time i will buy an aerosol version though as this one is kind of dirty to use :)	1
Exactly as advertised.  Simple and easy to use. A MUST HAVE for all K&N filter owners.  What more needs to be said?	1
this is the cleaner and oil for kn, what more do you want? finger will hurt after using the spray bottle, so pony up more for the regular hand sprayer or aerosol type or even put the cleaner in a hand sprayer yourself. Be innovative people..	1
I've used this product on all my vehicles since they all have K&N filters.  It was cheaper buying the item on line than at my local auto parts store.	1
Throw away the nylon washer. Install a copper crush washer on both sides of the pan and use Loctite 592.  24 ft/lbs of torque on the nut and no leaks at all.  Working great on my MB GL350 722.9 transmission.  The plug part does stick down a lot.  Will find a replacement on next fluid change.	1
Fitting didn't leak but plug did.  Cannot tighten any more, starting to strip!	-1
great	1
Great quality. I bought this to put in my 2013 ram 1500 transmission but sold it before I got to install it  It is high quality and I will use it in one of the vehicles when the time comes.	1
Perfect fit!!	1
B&M products never let me down yet. You pay for quality and that's what you get.	1
Used as a rear end fill plug. Works great.	1
No. Thanks.	-1
Ouch my ears hurt.	1
Horn is solid and heavy feeling, appears to be good quality. I installed it on my 2006 Suzuki GS500F, bolted right on and works great. The horn is sufficiently loud I am very satisfied with this product. For less than ten bucks this horn is a great replacement part.	1
Works fine	1
This Is Not A Horn For A Motor Vehicle, Don't Know If I Would Use It On A Bicycle. It Is Not Loud At All.	-1
Okay I'll give a couple stars for easy to install, and it is loud.  It is one of the wimpiest horns I have ever heard in my life, its really high pitched, not sure who's attention it would get.	-1
It leaks. Had to remove it	-1
I put it on my h2 so I would not have to drop all the skid plates and the protective steel cage to drain the trans pan. if you have a good step drill bit it works grate to threaded it directly into the pan. I still used the provided nut inside the pan but i think its less likely to leak with tight fit.	1
I'm using two of these on my vehicles right now and I love them. I do have to say that the first one I bought broke. It didn't come with instructions and the washer wasn't working at all. It leaked, and I had to pull the pan and start over. When I tightened it up more, it snapped in half. That's the bad news. The good news is that when I asked for a return/replacement, the seller sent me a new one with no questions asked. The new one had different packaging, and seemed to be a newer version (with instructions printed on the packaging). This time, I skipped the plastic washer and went a different route. I used chemical resistant silicon on the bolt and nut, inside and outside the pan. I tightened it up good with a lock washer on the outside of the pan and then let it cure overnight. I put in the drain bolt with a little bit of plumber's tape wrapped around the threads. This part requires two wrenches, one for the drain plug and the other to hold the assembly in place. After that, no more leaks and no more problems.  No product is ever perfect, but what puts a good product over the top is the commitment of the seller and manufacturer. They want to please customers by improving their product and standing behind it if it fails, and you can't ask more than that. 5+ stars!	1
Excellent quality, works better than the factory original.	1
Like I said in the title of this review what more can I say these product are far superior to anything else out there in the market as far as filters go they are number 1 in my book.  The kit comes with enough product for at least 2 cleanings even if you have the large filter just use the product according to the instructions and you are good to go.  Also let the filter dry COMPLETELY before putting the ol back on the filter.	1
Havent used it yet but assure its great product, i will do some research so that its used properly too much or too little has the same negative affect	1
I got this kit never having used a lifetime air filter before and not sure what to think of it.  Man, does it give you peace of mind to know you don't have to find a new one every few months.  Just pull it out, clean it, re-oil it and good to go.	1
Nice!	1
The transmission oil pan on my Ram is aluminium and thin. When i drilled the hole it did not bore thru in a perfect circle(oblong) but the plug sealed okay. When i went to drain the fluid a second time i turned the brass plug slightly before i had a wrench on the large nut causing it to leak. I removed the pan, tightened the large nuts which caused the nylon bushing too distort in the oblong hole. I fixed it with two large washers.	1
The drain plug turns in about 2 turns. Try to re-tap, did not make any difference Hope it does not leak. My suggestion, Install on side of pan. Otherwise drain plug stick out to far, does not look good.	-1
So far so good. No leaks after 2 weeks of install. Seems cheap but it works.	1
The instructions don't say where the included gasket is supposed to go. You've got a 50/50 shot. I'm not going to make a recommendation on the gasket, because mine is leaking. It's not a bad leak, but every time you look at the drain plug there will be a single drop of transmission fluid about to fall off it. Maybe I should have used Teflon tape or pipe dope on the actual drain plug?? Again, instructions don't say anything.	-1
The nut it latches onto inside the pan is a standard nut with 1/4 in or so sticking up. Thus you have 1/4 of fluid sitting in the bottom of your pan still. I over tightened and it completely ruined the plastic ring, then leaked until I spent $30 to replace the pan. Waste of money, but a good concept. They need a flush mount nut and then to screw it on the bottom, if that is possible.	-1
thanks	1
I put it on my GM car following the instructions on the package, and it went like clockwork...flawless.  Although, I did deviate from the instructions concerning one step...I replaced the nylon washer with a copper one.  It sealed tight and leak free with the recommended torque.  The copper washer will not exude under torque, deteriorate (metal v. nylon, when exposed to hot, cold, vibration, hydrocarbons, pressure, etc.) or leak.  I liked it so much, I bought one for my other car.	1
Like another reviewer, the plug for the one I got would only go in 2 turns. Decided to return it and get a new pan with a built-in plug from Rock Auto. It's not worth drilling a hole in the pan If this thing doesn't even go together right. The plug has fine thread and the hole is coarse. Plus I don't need the worry that this thing will leak on me.	-1
Have read up on this item's installation and will fit to the transmission pan when it gets a bit warmer.	1
Good deal. Good product. I have used almost all of these; they do a good job. I would buy again. Best price	1
The results speak for themselves.  Used K&N on my last truck and got 496,000 miles on it without ever touching the engine.  Have 179,000 miles on my "new" truck and never had it to a mechanic for other than normal maintenance, changing transmission fluid, etc.	1
Clears the sheep	1
I added this horn to my riding lawn mower.  After a few weeks, it stopped working.  I checked all the connections and they were all good and power was still being delivered to the horn. Upon further inspection of the horn, I noticed there was a center nut/bolt that holds the two halves of the horn body together.  The nut had vibrated loose.  I tightened it back up and the horn worked once again. I added some locktight to the nut to prevent it from falling apart.  The horn sound is your typical motorcycle "beep" but it is certainly loud enough for the streets. Installation was easy with a power wire and a ground.  I rated it 4 out of 5 because of the nut and bolt issue.  If yours stops working, check and tighten the center bolt.	1
This little sucker is loud for as small as it is... Works great on my custom go cart...	1
Awesome product. i put it on my 00Sv650 looks great and sounds great. Highly recommend	1
so far great no leaks wish the plug itself went farther up into the bolt according to the question i asked after a couple of changes it will go up in their a little farther each time	1
Does the job; just be careful about installing the washer.	1
Great Product Thank you!!	1
Purchased because jeep didn't think I'd want to drain the trans pan before I did the service. So far it's holding up well. No leaks and it was easy to install, although I did use a little rtv gasket maker as I wasn't 100% confident in the provided gasket.	1
Amazon provides a hard to find cleaning kit for the K&N auto air filters. Directions that come with the kit are a helpful reminder. There is enough Cleaner solvent and Oil for more than one cleaning. so it is an effective way to have clean filter for better fuel mileage w/o having to go out and find an OEM replacement	1
This filter care kit is just what you are looking for if you own a k&n filter. I clean my air filter every 5,000 miles or so. Make sure to follow the instructions so you don't hurt your filter. I have had ZERO issues with this product. The squeeze bottle works wonders if you are trying to get a line of oil into every pleat. The kit pays for itself. Recommend this to anyone looking to maintain their K&N filters.	1
The cleaner needs to sit a while to fully clean and you will need a double cleaning to get back to optimal performance. The re-oiling procedure takes a while as well. I would plan at least 3 hours for for cleaning and re oiling.	1
Great upgrade,  all transmissions should have one	1
excellent	1
Easy to install. Was a little worried I didn't tighten it enough, but so far no leaks.	1
I haven't used the kit yet because i have just put the filterrs in my car, the kit is perfectly packed and the presentation is excellent. it arrived pretty quick as well.	1
why use non recommended stuff for your k&n filters when this is available and so nicely priced! buy it use it and be happy!	1
works real easy and lasts forever would recommend to any with K&N filters just spray off dirt and drip on oil and ur good to go	1
The air sole can is definitely the way to go.  The liquid oil is much messier and doesn't apply as evenly.	1
nice and loud,works great	1
a shadow is louder  A complete waste of money and installation time	-1
can barely hear it.  Is ok if on a bicycle.  Not loud enough to hear over the ATV	-1
inside height scould be a little slimmer (1/4' height and leaves good abount of fluid in pan) but overall works as inteded	1
Awesome	1
Perfect for my 48re Ram 3500 trans pan. No leaking and easy to install. Just don't over torque the nut or you'll warp the silicon washer.	1
Good stuff	1
Just installed today; not knowing about leaks is the only thing stopping a fifth star.	1
Worked but needs welding in	1
D2Moto = junky junk dealer.  Been burned twice.  Biggest shipper to landfills I've ever encountered.  Not great about handling return requests, and prone to dealing with garbage or issue-laden products.	1
Installed in minutes!  Installed on my 2004 Trailblazer a few days ago, no leaks so far.  Just make sure you don't over tighten the jam nuts, the torque spec on the package seemed a little high.  I think it was 24ft pounds, which is more than plenty.  Make sure you anti seize the drain plug!	1
great Idea, but product quality is lacking, I put 8 lbs of torque on this bolt and the washer cracked, not so good in my eye's..maybe if you get some extra washer's then you will be in business.	-1
I have no idea why some car manufactures don't put drain plugs on tranny pans.  I guess they don't want you to change the fluid yourself so you have to take it to a dealer and get it done.  So here is the $10 solution, drop the pan once, install this plug, and you are all set for the life of the car to change the tranny fluid anytime.	1
Easy to install, and no leaks.  Put this in the trans pan during the last servicing, and now I know if I ever have to service the trans again, I won't have to deal with a full pan.	1
If you have an older transmission that your playing around with and need to remove the pan multiple times this will save you so much mess . Easy to install i would reconmend putting thread lock on the main part of it the piece that  bolt to the pan just so it doesn't rattle loose .	1
Cleaned the filter nicely. I was going to replace it but now I don't have to yet. Packaged nice, and everything was good. Recommend this to anyone with a Ram Intake.	1
OEM from K&N... I have not used it yet but it is just the same as you can purchase anywhere else for the premium price. I am new to K&N air filters so I will provide additional feedback if I find it does not work as advertised later on...	1
Says it is loud....nope Installed on a quad - first try to alert a rider required several attempts without acknowledgement of horn sounding. Spend more....unless your ride is electric and makes no noise	-1
inaccurate measurements could be more specific !	-1
Thrash!  Simply thrash.  Comes off within a very short time. Waste!	-1
The addesive is bad	-1
The filter itself is excellent but the filter oil caused all the intake sensors in my Mercedes and Jaguar to report errors.  My older cars are fine since they don't have sensors in the intake lines.  Mist a VERY THIN oil layer over the surface of the filter on the side that facing away from the intake then you will be fine.  Also, misting the filter with too much oil will defeat the high flow feature of the filter.	-1
One brand new horn did not work.  So I read the warranty to see how to get a replacement, no big deal right?  Wrong, now I have to pay to return it to them for inspection and pay $10 to get either the repaired horn sent back to me or a new one shipped to me.  Do not buy these products.	-1
Well you get what you pay for and paying only [...] bucks for an air horn was not a lot. This horn is not what I expected. Lately it appears there a lot of drivers on the road that must have gotten their licenses on line somewhere or via mail order. People are driving 20 mph "below" the posted speed limits.  I want a horn that when I hit the switch the reason I hit the switch gets out of my way ... with no hesitation! This thing sounds weak. My wife said it sounds like a sissy horn? I'm putting together the details of an air train horn hook up. I'm looking at spending 200+ so it better be 10 times louder. I did have a small problem with the way I was hooking it up and telephoned Wolo. After only a couple of minutes I actually "spoke" to a gut that really helped me.	-1
Barely sucked 1/2 a quart of oil. Thats after 4 attempts of 40-50 pumps each time. The pump handle fell off with a loud pop twice. If you value your time and sanity, I wouldnt use this clunker even if you get it for free.	-1
junk	-1
Bought this to change oil in my new Mercedes E350. Aero splash guards (common on new cars) cover the oil sump and drain plug. Because the oil filter is up top, I thought "great, easy DIY oil change with no mess." Wrong. After a couple of hours of effort I succeeded in sucking out about 1/3 of the oil. On top of that, it's very messy. After the first time I drained this unit, It had oil in the pump intake area which spit out on my hands during the next pumping session. Not avoidable as you have to turn it in that direction in order to pour the oil out.  So, I went back to the old fashioned approach under the car. Took me less than 10 minutes to remove the splash guards, and will be much quicker next time since I'm through the learning curve.  Bad purchase. I did not buy from Amazon -- shame on me for trying to save a buck on eBay -- so I'm stuck with it.  If you are determined to pump, take a look at the Mityvac as an alternative. I have not tried it, but have good experience with their brake system units.  As for the good, pulling a vacuum with this device is quite a vigorous upper body workout.	-1
I bought this several months ago and have just now got around to trying to use it. I pumped the handle 10 times and the handle came off in my hand. absolutely useless cheap plastic .  Don't wast your money...<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Air-Power-America-2000-LiquiVac-Oil-Changing-System-for-Large-Engine/dp/B0002AJR8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Air Power America 2000 LiquiVac Oil Changing System for Large Engine</a>	-1
Failed in about a year after used 4  - 5 times.  The pump failed internally.  Can no longer generate suction.  So much for that $50.  If it worked it would be stars.  I love the heavy wall material, the valve and the design.	-1
the best I ve used,,,last summer,, now, it won't pump out oil,, worked one time,	-1
work fine first time.  did not work again.	-1
Piece of junk broke after third use!	-1
Collapsed after 1 use, Pump became useless after two and unit failed completely after 3 uses.  sorry folks, it's junk - the good news is that it's mostly recyclable.	-1
Not really a fan of this unit.  I used it one time on a hot day, and the amount of suction caused the tank to implode and then leak oil everywhere.  I was using it on a boat to change the oil on an I/O motor.	-1
Look good, sounds good but doesn't work. Pumped it up and it will not suck fluid (oil to be exact). There is no vacuum leaks it just won't move the fluid, even after warming it up. Pumped fifty times as the instructions stated with the valve closed once tube was in the fluid and valve opened it started sucking and stopped not even 1/2 in the line. Closed valve and pumped more, same thing.	-1
Didn't work....ran the engine and warmed up the oil as noted. Pumped MAX 45 times and sucked out 1/2 quart....pump 45 again and again until blue ....gave up	-1
This product probably won't work with engines on a lot of newer cars, or any engine that has a dipstick with kinks in it. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with a modern car.  My husband tried using this to suction out the oil on a 2007 Honda Element. Followed all the instructions to the letter, pushed the tube in until it hit one of the places where the dipstick kinks. Gave the tube an extra push to get it past that point, and still couldn't get the tube in to the same length as the dipstick. Tried opening the valve anyway and it couldn't get anything out because the hose going past the dipstick kinks had pinched the tube shut.  We went over the instructions many times to make sure that we were't missing anything and concluded that this just won't work with our car. Unfortunately it is too late to return this and the tube is kinked and covered with oil.  Extremely disappointed. This seems like it would be a common problem and this product should have a list of cars that it won't work with.  I would absolutely NOT recommend this to anyone.	-1
If your using this for oil, good luck! Your better off sucking it with a soft drink straw	-1
Not a very good pump. Very slow flow. It does get the job done but it took about 2 hours to get 3 1/2 quarts removed.	-1
this unit takes forever to pull 5 qts of oil out of a car even with the oil heated up it took 2 hours to remove 5 quarts pretty poor systen	-1
I bought this to suck the oil out of my inboard boat engine. At first it worked fine, there was plenty of hose to reach the engine and the pump developed a good vacuum. However, when it came time to pump it up again the damn ball handle came off of the shaft and sliced my finger open in the process. I ended up using vice-grips to clamp the shaft and finish my oil change. Rather than try to get a refund I think I will drill the hole out bigger in the ball and use some JB Weld to hold it on.	-1
Amazon refunded this order. Thank you Amazon. The idea of the unit is simple. Create a vacuum in the container and the oil will be sucked into the container. However, the unit does not allow for smooth suction. The tube is too soft and collapsed under the suction. So did the container. The container would only fill 45%. I thought there must be something obstructing the oil. So, I got out my 10 year old MityVac (that started to leak on me, which prompted this purchase), and it evacuated the remaining oil. Save yourself the headache of trying this out, watching it not suck, cleaning all the oil out, and then having to return it.	-1
Was working great draining my front diff till the pull knob snapped off within 10min under standard use with no jerking or snatching. Don't think I'd care to try another	-1
No fuss, no mess when changing oil on the garden tractor or on the edger.  Downgraded from 4 to 1 star when plunger gasket failed after maybe a dozen uses - rendering the device useless.	-1
Opened and read instructions. got set up. on first pump the whole pump assembly fell apart.  Put it back together and had to hold the back piece in. pumped 40 out of the recomended 50 max.  It started sucking oil from engine, when vacuum got low i closed valve and began pumping again, at about 30 strokes the handle came of in my hand.  not worth the 40.00. piece of junk.	-1
this does not work.  Will not hold hold a vacuum when pumped.  Not worth the price. There must be better  ones out there.	-1
I didn't care for this product because it takes a lot of strength to pump the handle. I bought it to extract the transmission oil from my car but I could not get it to work. It was very tiring to pump it.	-1
WOW!! What an astounding piece of CRAP!! I thought magnetic fuel savers were a joke, they've got nothing on this thing. Used a grand total of 2 times, worked once. Went to change my oil today. Started pumping the thing down and the whole back of the pump handle just popped off. Then the fun began, yeah, my oil was a bit warm, the day was hot. I finally thought I had it ready to go and the whole thing imploded. Get out the wrench, crawl under the car and change it the old fashion way. I'm shocked that this even gets decent reviews, let alone raving reviews. Usless junk to me.	-1
This system requires a vacuum and the seals on mine failed after the 2nd use and it would no longer hold a vacuum.  They should have just made a pump system instead.	-1
When I ordered this, it was on a compatibility chart as working for my car, a Mercedes.  When it arrive, I checked the pinning and it IS NOT.  So BUYER BE WARE!!!!  I purchased the CORRECT one from ANOTHER vendor.	-1
I bought this to install a Boss Stereo from Amazon Prime into my 2004 Ford Focus. It is labeled for VW but my garage said it fits my 2004 Ford Focus. I thought it odd but assumed that it was correct. It isnt! Spent the morning in the shop connecting the adapter to my Boss Radio. I removed the stock Radio and found the adapter had no compatibility with my Focus at all! I found a Focus Radio schematic on YouTube and will proceed to do a wire by wire connection. Pictures show the adapter and stock Radio .	-1
Does not even come close to matching the car's wiring harness at all.  The unit is plainly the wrong one even though it was marked for the correct Beetle model year.  The connector doesn't even fit the car's wiring harness...pins are too big spaced wrong as well as there is a third section on the car side that this adapter doesn't even have.  Recommend you spend the money have a shop do it.	-1
This item does not fit the harness from a 2004 VW Monsoon radio Even though it was "verified".  It is for an older model.	-1
Does not fit my 02 VW Jetta	-1
The description claims "...Audi 88-99/Volkswagen 80-Up", but this adapter does NOT work on my 1990 Audi 80 quattro.  It has two jacks to accommodate the plugs in the car's harness that connect to the radio.  That would be wonderful, except my car has *3* plugs for the radio (in addition to the antenna): one for front speakers, one for rear speakers, one for power and control.  I don't think there's anything weird about my car... it has the stock radio that came on most of these models (I think some had a special Bose system, but my car does not).  Also the package was open and just held shut with a small piece of tape - some loose wires had fallen out and luckily I found them loose in the Amazon packaging.  Maybe some other unlucky Audi owner had received this and it didn't fit and returned it?	-1
This did not fit my 2005 civic LX special edition, very disappointed	-1
THIS DOES NOT FIT 2005 HONDA CIVIC!! The clips do not match up and the faceplate cover does not even cover my pioneer head unit. If you have a 2005 civic ex stay away!	-1
Did not fit my 2005 Scion, it is a "universal" application and not suitable for my car.	-1
Purchased for 05 Honda Civic EX Special Edition Coupe. Which came stock with the double din 6 disc changer. This does not fit what so ever. Had the dash all pulled out before I was made aware of this. Very, very frustrating.	-1
Using this with Pioneer DEH-X8500BH  1). The direction manual is EXTREMELY vague and unclear.  2). It pops in, then in a few seconds the bottom of the kit just pops out. So I called Metra's customer service to figure out what was going on and they tell me it should be working but I'll have to figure out a way to secure my stereo with a "strap" that comes with head units to support the weight? Well I looked it up, and have not found any information about any said "straps" for any head units.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  In conclusion these guys need to re-write their manuals in a clear understandable fashion. Get new customer service reps, and more of them. I waited for more then a half hour starting at 10am on a weekday to get a live person, and last but not least they need to actually make a product that fits and does what they say it will do.	-1
got this for my car after my oem stereo locked up because i disconnected the battery. the owner before me lost the security code.  i had to go to best buy to get a new one that fitted my car.	-1
I didn't realized it was a single DIN,  description was misleading	-1
I've bought 3 of these by now, and with this third one I learned that I should have gotten the original pocket from the start.  These don't fit in and look as nice as the original pocket does, it kind of stands out, and after pushing it in the first time, forget about taking it out in one piece.  No matter how carefully you are with it, the tabs or the trim piece that covers the face will snap off, and a few teeth will break off, making it impossible to put together in one piece again, so you either super glue it, tape it or come up with something special to put it in.  I just got an OEM pocket from a fellow Passat owner over the internet. It fits in MUCH MUCH better, it snaps into place perfectly, and doesn't rattle or break away.  In my opinion, spend the extra bucks getting the original pocket, you will not regret it.  Metra makes some good items, I got their harness and antenna, but this is not one of them.	-1
Went through a couple and the pins that held the front trim were broken upon arrival.	-1
Installed in a 2004 Volkswagen Jetta Gl. So I slide the factory stereo out, and pop this thing in. I have to admit that it looks good.... that is until you put a CD player under it. As you know or will find out putting a CD player in this jetta is a very tight squeeze, as there isn't much room for wiring harnesses and wires. So inevitably there is going to be some pushing and stuffing. With the smallest amount of outward pressure from the CD player, it will push on the bottom part of the pocket face and it WILL break the tabs. This leaves you with a decent looking pocket until you hit a bump. I have used a lot of dash kits in my 16 years of installing stereos, and this is the cheapest one I have ever encountered. If you buy this, all I can say is good luck and take your time.	-1
This thing is kind of stupid. It does fit the dash panel well, but requires that one insert the radio into the dash prior to putting the main panel back on. This makes removing the radio to screw with wiring or whatever extremely difficult. It would be a far superior product if they made it compatible with the standard DIN sleeves that come with every aftermarket stereo.	-1
It did not fit the single din radio.  This product is not compatible with single din, it's too small.	-1
Can't get radio in because top molding is tapered. Have to modify... What a pain	-1
Looks nice, but doesn't work.  Hole is too small for the radio to fit.  I tried 4 different radios and none would fit, hole was too narrow and not tall enough. I tried shoving it in there anyway and it broke, so I returned it.	-1
would not fit the radio I bought	-1
The instructions were not helpful for my 2000 Prelude.  I had to buy another kit from another manufacturer and figure out how to make those parts work for my vehicle.  It appears neither manufacturer provided sufficient instructions on this product for the Prelude.  The fit of this product (and the other one I bought) in the console opening could be tighter.	-1
this shouldn't have so many plastic parts.  take you time when using this kit.	-1
This dose not fit 1999 chevy silverado 1500, also the hole for radio mounting is way to small for after market radios	-1
Did not work for 1989 Honda Accord DX	-1
The opening for the radio is too small had to use my dremel tool to make the opening bigger just to get the radio to fit.	-1
A normal stero doesn't fit inside it.	-1
Does not fit my 2005 Chevy truck	-1
It works but it's nothing of quality. I installed my head unit using this for my 1999 Honda Civic LX. I had to cut off all the tabs because it was putting too much pressure on the frame where it rests. It actually started to split the dash trim from all the pressure. SO if you have a 1999 Civic throw out everything but the main filler piece. The rest of it is unneeded to get a nice, sturdy install.	-1
I ordered this piece for my 2001 mustang gt and when I got it, I found the installation to be very confusing, time consuming, and frustrating. Ultimately, once I ordered another Metra 70-5519 harness from someone else I discovered that this harness was missing some of the wires... The lesson learned is: Never order a used wiring harness, ever. Quite frankly I'm surprised that it was not inspected and tested before shipped. Rating: F-	-1
Don't even bother with this. I bought this for my 2003 Silverado and tossed it. Plastic is flimsy and when the deck is mounted to it it doesn't hold well at all and flops up and down. The Scoshe kit is much, much better.	-1
This item was recommended for the BOSS BV9976B, according to Amazon, but the radio does NOT fit nto the opening of the Dash Kit. Had to purchase another Dash Kit (SOSCH ID#: GM1583B)  (the BOSS slid in great)  I would like to get a refund on the item.  Good Luck	-1
Junk as advertised	-1
shipped with other items in a plastic bag and was broken when it arrived.  needs to be packed better top where radio fits was broken at the bottom right just above the storage slot.	-1
It says 01-03 but it should really say 00-02 because in 2003 they changed the plug setup to three instead of two. So this will not fit 2003 mustangs with the mach sound system. BUYER BEWARE. It was good quality but just the wrong part for my application and the misrepresentation in the title.	-1
Did not fit aftermarket JVC head unit.  Even after removing the carriage from the unit and the trim plate the opening was still over 1/4" too small both width and height.  There were no adapters or instructions to modify the kit to allow fitment.	-1
Cheap plastic did not fit  boss head unit	-1
I bought this for my 2000 chevy silverado, which amazon advised it fit. It does not. This product is for a Double Din application, a 2000 Chevrolet silverado/ck1500/tahoe/suburban requires a 1.5 DIN application. Make sure to double check your sizes!	-1
Usually when looking at an item with such a good rating you only need to scan the top worst rating to get a feel for any potential problems.  Unfortunately, at the time of this review, all the reviews mentioning the single DIN issue have no ratings!  I just gave them helpful clicks, but it's annoying.  The hole in this is absolutely WAY too small for most single DIN radios.  A number of people liking this thing even admit having to modify it to get their radios to fit.  Sorry, that unacceptable for a radio face-plate.  ISO is supposed to be "International Standards" not "we'll make it kinda sorta close enough that you can ghetto rig it to fit"  Hopefully I can post a video shortly to show how it doesn't fit at all, maybe that will help prevent others getting suckered like I did.	-1
This fit my car and looked good but it was to narrow for the stereo and it broke when I tried to install it. I bought a scosche and it fit both the radio and the car.	-1
Does not fit my chevy 2002 tahoe... Not happy now I need to find one that will fit my tahoe...	-1
First the positives. It seems well made and it fit perfect in my 2004 Sierra. Unfortunately, it didn't fit my single din flip touch screen. After a lot of trimming, sanding and spray paint it worked. If you're not good modifying things then don't buy this kit.	-1
I don't know if I accidently orderd the wrong one, or the description was wrong, or they sent the wrong one but it didn't work for my 2001 Ford Focus.	-1
This adapter DOES NOT fit on a 2004 Ford Focus ZX5. It was advertised as a fit but it doesn't fit by a long shot. Good thing that the factory plugs fitted the new radio without having to splice wires.	-1
This does not fit a 2003 Ford Focus. Amazon's filter to check if this fits your car is incorrect.	-1
You need to cut and splice the wires into your radio, the plugs connect to the vehicle harness. This doesn't save you much of anything until you're ready to replace the radio again.	-1
Didnt fit my car.	-1
This is listed to work for my 2001 E350 but it did not work, the plug in my van is different so be careful you check your vehicle before ordering this plug.	-1
This does not work with a 1997 F150 truck with 10 disc CD changer.  I end up reinstalled original back in. Too much time wasted	-1
All I know this does NOT work with a 2003 FORD FOCUS with Blaupunkt MP3/cd Dual din Stereo.. still looking for the right one!!!	-1
Did not match my radio. They show a generic or (might not be exact) in the ad. I don't know why they cant show exact product. Waste of time and money. Better off buying from a radio shop so you get the right one. delivery as expected ...... on time	-1
Even amazon listed this as being compatible in a 2000 mercury cougar. I removed to stock stereo only to find that this adapter is not the right size/number of pins. Amazon won't let me return it, only replace it. I should have paid extra and bough one from a local store, then I could have actually returned it. You're letting me down amazon	-1
Did not fit. Not worth returning.	-1
It said it fits my 04 satun vue but it didnt	-1
Colors didn't really match up at all	-1
Not for use if you have an infinity sound system.	-1
absolutely not useful on a 2005 Durango too cheap to hack back out of my truck to send back.  Wasted a day out of this cable.	-1
Installed radio, checked wires many times but, this would happen and my gauges would die. Sometimes even stall my truck out. Has anyone heard of no bus? Had to remove radio and now no issues.  2005 Dodge Ram 2500	-1
I am sure the product works great, but mine arrived missing a solid purple wire.  I had to go to a local store and pay $20 for a new one, as I could not wait 2 days for a new one to get to me.  Returning item.  (Notice the solid purple missing wire)	-1
Does not fit a standard radio in the opening. Does not fit the mounting on a 2000 Dodge Neon	-1
Did not fit. Had to get a refund	-1
not working	-1

this product did work but it was hard to get the harness to connect to the factory harness. Buy metra	-1
Radio did not fit in the opening	-1
Had to return because it didn't fit my truck as described.	-1
Kit looks nice after finally getting it installed.  Cons, doesn't come with mounting screws..  Doesn't come with Antenna connector.. Now I had to order the antenna connector now knowing it's needed so I'm going to have to undo everything all over again just to hook up the antenna.. Would have preferred a complete kit..	-1
Doesn't fit Wrangler TJ	-1
Garbage product, no radio i have fits in it i had to chop and cut a lot off of it for it to fit however it did fit my chrysler sebring	-1
This thing sucks	-1
Junk. Very loose fit in a Jeep TJ	-1
Ordered this to make my stereo install easier and it very much did, however tho after being installed my speakers would hevily distort at less than half power, after much struggle and tuning I could not get it to go away. After cutting this plug out and hand splicing the wires together with electric tape ( I ordered the plug to avoid doing this) the distortion went away completely and my speakers sound great at full power. I hate to give a bad review but in this case the product had negitive affects and I wouldn't recommend it.	-1
Do not buy this piece of crap. I bought it to install a new stereo in my sons jeep and although it does fit the dash the stereo would not fit in the unit. I had to use a dremel to make the opening bigger so I could do a temporary install until I can order a different one that will actually fir properly. Had it not been Christmas morning and the new stereo was his present I would have shipped it back. I was absolutely disgusted with the product and installation experience. What should have been a 15 minute job turned into an hour and a half. Thanks METRA for such a crappy product.	-1
Did not fit the radio... the opening was too small.... not worth sending back so I'm out the money..	-1
GARBAGE KIT, nowhere on the product description does anything say about being a ISO kit, therefore is misleading to the general consumer, I purchased a new Pioneer DEH-X9600BHS with the intention of using this kit for its cubby hole for papers and such, after removing my trim ring on my brand new stereo, and still isn't even close to fitting, total WASTE OF MONEY, HORRIBLE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION.	-1
I thought it was a good price but Crutchfield sells the stereo, wiring harness, antenna adapter and mounting kit for a total of 119.00. You buy the stereo and get everything else free.  Buy your system through Crutchfield and its free 2 day shipping.	-1
The slot for the radio was to small and radio didn't sit right. I tried to exchange it but no one will listen.	-1
I purchased this for installing a Clarion NZ-503 in my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  The Clarion is one of the few, if not the only, single DIN receiver with  GPS navigation, via a pop-out screen.  I attached the Metra bezel using the thick ISO mount side plates, but because of their thickness (vs. thin metal DIN enclosures) the screws included with the Clarion were too short to attach the thick side plates, so I had to get some metric M5 screws that were 10 mm in length at the hardware store.  I think Metra should have included these screws, since it is their thick plated product that resulted in the existing screws not working.  Minus one star.  (Update:  in comparison, the competitor Scosche kit did include the screws, but had other problems detailed below).  Also, because of the tight fit of the Metra bezel, the has problems sliding in and out.  I have to help it slide in and out, which will no  doubt damage the motor. In the long term.  Minus two stars for that.  I have ordered the other Metra kit 99-6505 and also the Scosche Jeep kit and I hope one of these works better than this kit.  Perhaps I should not have expected to use a kit that did not permit allow for pop-out stereos, but Metra's website did not explain this, so I blame them.  Update:  The Scosche Jeep kit had a poor fit, where its rounded rectangular bezel didn't quite fit within the rounded rectangular opening of the Jeep bezel.  Not recommended.  The Metra Kit 99-6505 fit very well and didn't interfere with the pop-up function of my Clarion.  That kit allows both DIN and ISO installation, but its downside is that you will need to add the secondary bezel, which some may consider a cluttered look.  If your stereo does not have any pop-out/flip-out/removable face function (and doesn't require its own secondary bezel), and can be installed as an ISO unit, I would recommend the Metra 99-6504 over the Metra 99-6505.	-1
Fit the jeep. But was too thin for the deck. (Got the correct one, and fit great). It was just a regular single din.deck.	-1
I bought this after they said it would fit a 2002 Chrysler pt cruiser didn't even fit the car don't recomand this product	-1
I bought this for a 2004 Chrysler Sebring, the way it looked in the dash was great but when installing the stereo head it the stereo would not fit it was about 1/2 in. too short on top! No matter what we tried it wouldn't fit so I had to run to Walmart to buy something else. However Amazon did a great job in my returning the product!!	-1
I bought this item as it was described as working on a 98 Jeep.  However, it should have specified a Grand Cherokee vs a normal Cherokee.	-1
Does not work on a Hyundai Accent. Tried for an hour, all I ended up doing was scratching the door panel. What did work was a towel trick I found on Youtube, and it was free.	-1

This product was NOT compatible with my 2004 Ford F150 4x4 super crew cab as specified.	-1
Several pins were severely bend out of shape inside of the harness, so I could not even use it. I did not even plug it into the original connector in order not to damage it.	-1
When Amazon tells you that an item will not fit your car, listen, even if the product description says that it will fit your car. I bought this for my 2005 Kia Sorento EX and it does not fit.	-1
Junk Did not fit	-1
Did not for specified vehicals	-1
Does not fit 04 Kia sorebto	-1
Power electrode of the connector is too thin and short to properly engage OEM connector.  Power was not stable due to intermittent connection	-1
Hate it a real POS. I knew it was a universal fit and cutting and filing was required. It didn't fit at all in my 1994 Miata. The DIN mount was too tight and didn't fit in the car.	-1
Wow. Did not fit well at all in my 90 Miata. I made it work with a lot of dremel work. Plan on buying a dremel if you don't have one. A lot of modification is required.	-1
This is the worst installation kit I have every gotten! This is no way easy installation. You will have to cut, trim, and melt numerous corners of the kit to make it fit into a 93 Miata. The plastic is extremely fragile and the instruction is horrendous. It took me almost 3 hours to make it just fit in my car, but it is still protruding out of the dashboard. I no way recommend this for a NA Miata, I understand this is a cheap fix but if you care to save your $15 bucks - don't but it. The kit is essentially made for multiple cars.	-1
Item came damaged	-1
Did not fit my 2004 ford escape... I'm returning it	-1
wont fit a 98 expedition	-1
The connector fits the Ford Excursion OEM wiring, but it was missing some of the pins (wires) needed. If you buy a 16 pin harness, it should have 16 wires, whether you use them or not! Re-bought from a different vendor.(Absolute USA H598/1771 Radio Wiring Harness), that harness was only missing 1.	-1
Very poor fit in a 96 Miata.  Lots of trimming.  Lot of force required.  Plastic is very brittle.  3/16in gap around the radio.  If you have another option try that instead. On the plus side it did finally fit.	-1
Fit in the car but the radio won't fix in the opening	-1
Was missing one pin and another was recessed when I received it. Very poor quality!	-1
According to the manufactures website, this is supposed to fit a 1997 miata. However, it didn't seamlessly fit mine. The design of this is to fit several other Mazda models, which I felt was a bad thing. Typically, when you make a "universal part" that means it won't fit exactly. I took a chance with this and wished I hadn't.  Read on.  The unit requires tabs to be removed depending on which model vehicle you're installing it in. While removing these tabs, the flimsy frame of the unit broke. Since I needed to install the unit, I super glued the breaking point back together. That didn't hold it for the install, as the area was just subject to to much stress throughout the install.  Since I was going from the factory double din to a single din, I put the included "pocket" in for the bottom, which didn't work out for me (the pocket rocks).  The unit didn't fit in the opening of the miata. I had to do some trimming of various parts of the unit to get it to fit into my dash. Overall, this was not a pain free installation. If I had to do all over again, I'd pick another brand. I had previously used this brand to install a stereo in my jeep, which was painless and easy. This model, however, was nothing but problematic.  Long story short:  buy at your own risk.	-1
Harness has the wires in correct spots but no labeling and it is a bi_tch to get it out once plugged into factory harness. Once apart it was eveident that it had damaged the factory orange pin separator. Still works it just another example of CHINA JUNK.	-1
Did not fit	-1
They need to post a list of radios that they know will work with it. The Pyle model PLM34M will not marry up to this trim.  Does Metra think Radio faceplates will be engineered as if the radio manufacturer knew their radio were going to be used with a Metra adapter?  I don't see that happening very often.  SHOW PEOPLE THE LIST!  WHAT MODEL RADIOS WILL WORK WITH THIS?	-1
Nicely built, but didn't fit my truck.	-1
Did not fit my 04 Sport Trac Explorer like Amazon said.	-1
doesn't work on escape	-1
Ford Focus 2003 2.3L. Had to cut away a lot of the plastic to make it fit correctly with my XO Vision XD103 FM and MP3 with MP3 aftermarket radio. Will be ordering Metra 99-5806 Dash Kit shortly	-1
didn't fit well, and brittle. One clip broke	-1
Not appropriate for my radio and car.	-1
didn't need this ....	-1
I got this for a '93 Econoline van.  Looking at the directions, I don't think I actually use any of the pieces if I'm mounting a DIN radio.  Also, it seems to be missing one or two of the parts listed in the instructions.	-1
Didn't fit can't send back	-1
Product was not for the car they says it would fit. Returned for refund.	-1
wrong one no refunds available	-1
Guess you get what you pay for. Pins were loose popped out back. Once got them reinstalled in proper holes couple of drops of super glue solved problem.	-1
This is way too this for most stereos.  Unfortunately I had to go with another brand as this is way too small!	-1
DOES NOT FIT MY 2004 HYUNDAI SANTA FE!! I have the monsoon sound edition but was unaware that meant that i needed an alternative harness, the description of this product should note that it does NOT fit any Hyundai with monsoon edition stereos.	-1
While the kit does fit in my car - 2002 Ford Focus - the opening where the radio should go does not fit the stereo I bought - XO Vision XD103. So BEWARE! Buy the Metra 99-5806 kit instead!!! The 99-5200's opening is too small!	-1
doesnt fit car it says it does	-1
Did not fit my 98' F-150.  Waste of money- went into the trash	-1
Yeah the harness didn't match at all for my 07 KIA OPtima.  I use amazon for everything possible but 2 out of three harnesses haven't matched according to the fitment selector.  Sending this one back and I have to make a dreaded trip to best buy if I want to get it installed this week sometime.	-1
sent back, not the right one	-1
If you know what each wire is connected to then this is OK. If you don't then you are out of luck because this harness's wires are not labeled in any way. You don't know which ones are for power and which ones are for the speakers. very lazy on the manufacturers part. I mean if you know which connector and wires to use then stick a label on the wire just like the harnesses on the new radios you can buy nowadays does. It's not rocket science people.	-1
tool box filler	-1
Incorrect discription. DOES NOT FIT 2003 FORD TAURUS!!!	-1
does not fit 1997 dodge Dakota as stated would.	-1
Doesnt have a ground wire....	-1
did not work for my husbands truck but it said it would fit so it wasn't worth sending back	-1
listed as the wrong harness for my truck	-1
This harness was not the right one for this car.  Had to send back and reorder the right one.  The product description was vague on this model of car.	-1
Like with the dash kit i will not be buying there cheap lack of info Harness again and warn anyone not to purchase unless it says it fit your cars make,model & serie. Did it plug in...Yes but the colors of the wiring harness and what the instructions said. I made it work but wasn't happy with it!	-1
this item was recommended because of a radio i bought, turns out i wasted money on this cause i didn't need it.  it is a shame that Amazon more often than not recommends items that aren't even needed	-1
Did not fit my Jeep Wrangler 2004 TJ.	-1
Does not fit my 94 Jeep yj factory radio harness.	-1
Wrong connectors. These are male and should be female. For some reason they aren't returnable.	-1
I bought this for a 2005 Jeep Wrangler, although it is listed as the correct plug it is not. I ended up getting a Scosche adapter and it had the ends pictured here as well as the right connections for my Jeep.	-1
Same as stock harness. Thought it was a adpater for after market radio	-1
Not what I expected	-1
Did not fit for the vehicle	-1
Cheapest connectors I ever used that metra made. I used these to wire an amp to factory head unit so I wouldn't have to cut orginal wiring. A few days after install my car wouldn't unlock or start like it had a security problem. I unplugged my radio and everything worked like nornal. I found the class 2 communication wire in this connector to be very very loose when fitting over pin. I had to repin the terminal to make it work but it still makes me worry.	-1
I read the reviews and other people said it fit fine. I got the plug spliced together with the radio harness, ripped my dash out, removed the radio, and low and behold the plug is wrong. Aggravating to say the least. If you have the wide plug on your wiring harness this will not work. I'd like to add a picture of my plug for comparison but I don't see the option.	-1
I purchased this for my 2001 Mercury Sable, thinking that it would connect directly to the wiring somehow with the factory wiring.  It does not in any way, shape or form connect to anything related to my make and model car.  For whatever reason, this was recommended by Amazon as something that other people bought along with the kit I needed to replace the factory stereo, with an aftermarket one.  I don't know why, since the two really aren't related.  Other than that, I suppose it's a sturdy wire harness if were to be used properly...	-1
Does not fit a 2004 Chrysler sebring touring 4door sedan	-1
didn't work and Amazon refused to refund	-1
Ordered the wrong part which was my fault but upset no free returns.	-1
i need the male metra turbo wires	-1
the plug that is attached to the 2000 pontiac montana is a male plug......this is a male plug.....i need a female....so this does not fit a pontiac montana as described	-1
Does not fit a 2007 sierra pickup as it says it does.	-1
Thought this is what I needed to wire my after market radio as it popped up with the din kit so I bought both! Found out when it arrived it was the same female connection as went to the old radio! My only complaint is why would it pop up! They knew I was hooking up an after market radio! Totally worthless!	-1
Neither one fit my radio harness wiring,.....	-1
This part was not the correct part needed to instal the aftermarket radio.  Ended up sending back and going to Best Buy.	-1
I bought this to put an aftermarket radio in my 04 Colorado.  Wrong part!  This is a replacement stock harness for stick radio	-1
The wire connection was the correct "factory" connection, but before you can start with that, you must completely rewire it. Pull ALL the wires out and start from scratch. That's what I did. Also, DO NOT follow their wire "codes". Make sure and follow the color codes with your vehicle. In my case (2003 GMC Sierra 1500 HD) it didn't have some of the color wires that I needed, so I had to compromise and use some of the other wires after shrink wrapping them the correct color. This should REALLY be a separate package of wires and connector. But it did work fine with some work on my end.	-1
Yes,it does work on infinity sound with amp. The 1818 harness is not needed,thanks phone guy! Just go blue to blue and white and it works, I don't know if the amp is working but the new stereo is. PS.hey phone guy my name is not BUD! Jack ass. Thanks for the help,1 800 no help.	-1
sorry did not work for me i specific ask for 03 jeep liberty and i have to go buy some local so i end up waist more money and to returned i got pay ,screw once again.	-1
this is not a plug and play and must still do some splicing and cutting to get it to work. it should be a little more clear in the listing since most people would not understand that.	-1
I can't get the prop to collapse...3 people tried and failed.	-1
I've got 04 Chrysler Sebring convertible and this harness doesn't fit the factory plug in any form , shape or fashion. I will never again buy harness' through the internet.  I will go to best buy as I've now learned my lesson for things you can't see don't buy unless your absolutely certain something will fit.	-1
didnt need it could not send it back	-1
I expected the love this product, we have another at our shop which has held up for years. I wanted my own that wasn't soaked in oil so I could easily test the brake lights without using a mirror. Occationally it's used as a hood prop when the shop one is in use but I'm really not happy with the build quality of my new one. The catching mechanisms leave gouges and scratches while extending the prop and it doesn't lock in place well. Occationally it will jam and require excessive amounts of force to unlock it again. Other times just a little bit of pressure and it just collapses. Nothing like very same one that's used at my shop.	-1
it would be a 5 star review because the wires are pretty good sized not chincey fragile wires and the plastic is good, but unless you want to take the time and test every combination of wires its useless there are three power wires for different models which is fine but none of the rest of the wires matched the original car harness colors and there was really no labeling on the oem side for it to be useful with that being said its hefty but kind of useless	-1
This harness is the pigtail from the main harness. Do not buy this one if you are putting in a head unit. You need the female side harness, this is the male.	-1
I installed this in a 2004 volkswagen jetta gl. Honestly, this harness is a waste of time, and to be quite honest it's a waste of plastic. It took me the better part of an hour just to get the plug to seat into the factory harness due to some pretty crappy construction. I don't like to write reviews, let alone bad reviews, but do yourself a favor and spend a little extra money on a better harness. I've been installing stereos since before they started making these (apparently sometimes) handy harnesses and this is the most useless one yet. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I did eventually (even though I didn't think it was going to be possible) get it to work. If you decide to buy this, be prepared to cuss.... a lot!	-1
PURCHASED THIS ITEM BECAUSE IT STATED IT WAS A FACTORY FIT TO MY 2006 BMW X5 RADIO. NOT EVEN CLOSE. NOT SURE WHICH ONE IT FITS, BUT NOT MINE.	-1
Ive installed many double din units in vw's .. I ordered this one as because my local store closed.  Because this is a universal unit designed for several models there is extra steps needed to complete the install.  Take a moment to look at others.	-1
nice product but does not fit my car. Although it is listed for my make and model it is incorrect.	-1
Becarefull, after receive mines I notice the grill is black and the box have have a note inside from KC saying that they are not producing the chrome grills anymore, I'm considering return the to amazon because are not what they show in the pics	-1
I gave these things a 2 star rating because we have 8 sets of them installed on our county patrol cars.  Not sure what the issue is but the bulbs are burning out at a pretty often rate.  I just had one officer tell me both his lights burnt out last night, 01/23.2014.  Maybe the 130 watt bulb is just getting too hot but we have lost about 8 to 10 bulbs within a years time.  Hope KC reads this and can do something about that issue.  Other than that, they are a great, powerful light that reaches out so you can see those darn deer ahead of you.  Be safe and maybe look for another type of light that will give you longer service life before you spend the money on these.	-1
This is esentially dollar store quality.  The connectors are garbage - and the assembly of the wiring harnesses is done with no apparent pride in workmanship.  If you don't notice and fix these problems yourself, you may short your battery, and if you are really unlucky you'll ruin your car's electronics - like the engine control module.  You can do much better with other brands, who aren't playing off their has been brand name from the 1970's.	-1
These do not come with any sort of diagram as to how they are supposed to fit upon the KC Lights. These did not fit my 6" KC's. They snap over and then loosely rattle around. I will be returning these as they do not fit. Like others have stated I could try electrical tape or zip-ties, but I want them to simply fit, not modify them. Especially at this price.	-1
the elastic wore out quickly	-1
Lost one in the Wind  Not Good	-1
Stich is crooked  looks terrible	-1
Way to expensive for what you get. 3 months on the vehicle and the elastic lost it's strength on the covers and they began to blow off. Had to stop and go back and pick them up. Should have left them there if not for the potential littering ticket. Garbage. Too late to return them. Buy the hard plastic version or generics. Very disappointed.	-1
The Elastic Bands inside the stitching broke loose after a month in the sun, even without any exposure to the sun.  Funny how the smiley face is wearing sun glasses, didn't seem to help though.  I'm going back to the plastic covers with sturdier clips.  Don't buy these, I think they were hand made by a 12 year old in Pakistan.	-1
Cheap junk broke already... in laws are truckers and depended on this and it stopped working ...	-1
I want my money back	-1
Does not look like the one pictured. It has NO holes for the rear view mirror like the one on the pic.	-1
Terrible fit, extremely loose. Vinyl bead that forms the diameter of the tire was choppy and creating flat lines rather than a smooth round continuous diameter around the tire.	-1
Looks cheap.	-1
fit as designed, seemed well built when I put it on but its only been 2 months and where it contacts the tire its all brown bleeding through to the front and looks dated now.  Not sure why they don't line the inside with something heavier to prevent the bleed through...wish I knew and I would have bought a black one	-1
very cheap	-1
The Arizona sun roasted this into shreds in one season. I think I should look for a metal spare tire cover.	-1
Does not fit as advertised	-1
Do not use on motorcycles, it eventually breaks the rubber valve, bad experience.... (Fatigue)	-1
I bought these to allow me to get to my rear motorcycle tire with a little more ease. I was disappointed in the look after screwing it on to my valve stem. It was too gaudy. It stuck out like a sore thumb. Prolly okay on a truck tire, but not a motorcycle.	-1
bought this and a valve extension to find out that you can not use it on rubber installed valve, must be steel valve.....none of the info was forwarded by Amazon!!!!!	-1
They leaked on all 4 wheels, thought it was my stems so I removed them and tried them on my other wheels and they leaked there as well. That was on rubber stems. Tried them on my steel stems I have on another truck and they leaked there too.	-1
Show the dang tire size chart on your add! Lordy how many wrong size complaints do you need before you give a size chart?	-1
Came off on the first trip (40 miles) never to be seen again, waste of money. Yes it was the correct size, just not strong enough elastic to hold it on I suspect.	-1
After 6 months of exposure, it's already cracking and flaking all over. Poor quality imo	-1
Just opened the box and it was torn around the seam. Made of  Cheap material. Can't return because of Amazon return policy.	-1
Couple months ago I bought one black and one white cover, for two of my trailers.  The black one was stitched crooked at the bottom and doesn't fit well.  Yesterday I opened the box for the white one and found instead of "polar white" as advertised, it's white with LAVENDER piping around the edge. Come on folks, be honest about what you're selling. Too late to return so this one goes in the trash.	-1
Bought two of these, one white, one black.  Black was OK quality but the stitching at the lower part is crooked causing the cover to not fit well .  Update: Bought in August, and just opened the second cover, the "polar white" one.  It is white vinyl with LAVENDER piping around the edge.  useless to me, and too late to return.  Waste of money, and it's going in the trash due to the bad description.  I guess this seller is just getting rid of "seconds" by selling online. Zero stars.	-1
First of all, a real A/C Cover will withstand a drive around the block.  Not this one, it tore the first go around and I had to basically duct tape it to keep it on at all.  Don't waste your money.	-1
Oh China, you cut corners in this one too. The 3/4" hose adapter is attached to the sewer fitting with a 3/8" or less metal tube that clogs. I get so annoyed with products like this that only required a little thought and some better part sourcing. That's China for you 80% of the time with products like this....	-1
I bought this tire cover because of the name. It ripped at the seams when I went to install it for the first time. It is made cheaply with weak seams. My advise don't buy this tire cover.	-1
Everyone beware description of this item is complete wrong from what I got . The item I got was black not white, the description says it is 27 3/4 from mount to mount and the one in the box is 18 inches. And to top it off the pictures shows a full size Lend a hand and what I got was a mini grab handle. The item itself is a good product I have installed many of them in my line of work. So I knew what I was looking for so when I found this one the picture first caught my eye as being a full size the headline said it was white. I then read the entire description and when I saw the measurements I figured I was good to go. Wrong !!!!!!! I bought this one as a gift for a friend for Christmas. Now I'm screwed trying to do something else at this late date. Who ever wrote this ad needs to get there s____ together	-1
Not worth the money.  After wrenching these snugly onto the valve stems and following the instructions for setting the depth of the valve depressor, both of these came loose on a cross country trip and gave me two flat tires on my motor home.  The tire mechanic said that he runs into problems with these all of the time.  Knowing that it is impossible to put air into the reversed tires on an RV dualie, the tire mech said it is better to get braided long extenders and weave them through the cover holes and use the spring clip to retain them.	-1
AVOID THIS PRODUCT! They look great but the O-ring that seals to the valve stem are too thick and block air flow into or out of the tire. I checked this on a spare valve stem and if tightened these extenders will totally block 150psi air pressure.	-1
leak - don't recommend.	-1
These extensions have a hard plastic seal instead of a rubber or semi rubber seal, if your valve stem has threads that are slightly damaged or the top of you valve stem is not completely flat, then adding these will not work ...they will leak...these are a waste of money ...do not buy	-1
These came apart while the tire specialist was installing them.  I am so very lucky that they didn't come apart while we were driving the RV!	-1
These tire valve extenders suck. They are absolutely useless with the dually wheels. I wish I had not bought them. The 180 degree valve makes it impossible to attach the valve extender and then be able to put air in the tire. I would not recommend these for anyone with an RV. I would give it zero stars if possible.	-1
First day 3 snaps came out of the skirt m,aterial is ghreat but snaps amnd installistation of same is poor cheap snaps would be a great product if they put in QUALITY snaps!!! Now strake torn out after a  15 mph wind Don't buy	-1
Atwood makes greats products... This one being GAS ONLY sucks for recovery compared to a gas/electric product.	-1
I just received this yesterday. Try on my beige leather seat. Blue spot Still There. This Is worthless.	-1
I previously rated as excellent but I have since downgraded to two stars. I have tried to clean my light colored seats in my 2012 Infiniti and found that the cleaner did not get the seats cleaned. I did not have this problem when I used it on my 2007 Miata seats.	-1
This arrived with the top sprayer broken. The box was soggy and there was some fluid left in the container. I have not used the product yet but the packing has left a bad taste (not literally) in my mouth. I'll update the product properties when I get around to cleaning my leather chairs.	-1
Did not get the gray dirt off my leather in my car.  Disappointed in this product.  I followed instructions but black dirt stains still there.	-1
For the money, it did very little to clean our sofa.  Even though our sofa is not that badly stained, we had expected to see more results than we did and we both worked on the sofa in tandem and notices no difference and absolutely no condition of the leather at all.	-1
I got this Lexol Leather pH Cleaner Spray offline at a local auto parts store...and I am glad I did.  I start cleaning my car and the first thing I notice is the citrus smell.  Suddenly half through cleaning the passenger front seat the sprayer broke.  At this point the white cleaning rag I was using was still white and given I had not cleaned the seats in months I just returned it.  So I went online and after much research ordered&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Griot-s-Garage-11259-Leather-Care-Spray-Kit/dp/B003V3TQEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Griot's Garage 11259 Leather Care Spray Kit</a>.  Well, the Griot cleaner cleaned old grime of the leather seats I had cleaned with the Lexol cleaner a week earlier.  I have used a variety of leather cleaners over the years and in my experience this one does absolutely nothing.	-1
I used both the cleaner and the conditioner as described but they did not make a difference on decent looking leather seats in my 2003 Sienna. If they made a difference I have not realized it. I do not regret buying these, I hope they will add to the life of the leather seats even though I have not observed a change in appearance.	-1
The conditioner is an amazing product but it was shipped poorly and 1/5 of the bottle had leaked out into the bag... I just ended up using a rag to sop it up and applying it to my seats with the rag.	-1
Tried it on a spa cover to protect it from the elements thinking it would work as a water repellent.  It does - for about a week then it wears off.  Not necessarily the products fault, but I expected it to last a lot longer...	-1
Expected More from Lexol Brand	-1
Never will buy it again !!! useless & after few hours like I did not put anything on the seat !!	-1
Didn't clean my Caddy well at all.  It took ONE WHOLE bottle to get my car done. I will not be buying this again.	-1
leaked all over	-1
Not the best product to choose.	-1
As a hobby, I've been detailing cars for years.  This is by far, hands down, the worst leather conditioner I have ever had the displeasure of using.  It left a gooey, sticky film on all surfaces.  I literally had to go back and reclean all the seats to get rid of the film  I even waited a half hour thinking it had to cure or something, no such luck.  Maybe I got a bad batch of it, but save your money and use something else.  I recommend Blackfire leather conditioner that's what I'm using now, it's great!	-1
it is ok for making black parts more black. I purchased this to give a little matte finish to the interior, so says the description, but the interior became shiny and looked like polished. it does not help in CA at all	-1
I did my research and understand other brands that use silicon are bad etc. etc.....Lexol is suppose to be all natural, but I won't use this stuff again.  I used it on a pair of cowboy boots and despite the label saying that it's a 'Non-Darkening Formula' it did darken them substantially...I also tried it on my Dainese motorcycle jacket and it left it feeling tacky and sticky...glad I stopped there, I'm sure I would have been more annoyed if I used it on my car seats....I won't be using this product again.  ...going to try Mother's Reflections one-step leather cleaner/conditioner....I'll update later....	-1
This stuff is terrible. Luckly I only used it on part of the drivers seat first. It smells horrible and makes the seats sticky and hard to slide on and has an odd smell. I have a 2013 fx4 and I hope this stuff goes away quick. I did everything like it said, very light coat waited 3 minutes then buffed. Sorry Lexol but you won't be selling to me again.	-1
The top was loose and half the liquid leaked out in the box; what a mess. I will report on its use at a later date.  I would not buy this again due to losing half in transit. (9/12/13) Update:  Even though Half was lost in the box, the product works great. I have a lot of black vinyl on the outside of the car which gets whitish looking.  I put this stuff on, rubbed it in, and the white cast disappeared and has not returned yet(about 2 months).	-1
IMO, because of packaging style, the package arrived with the top of the sprayer broken off - leaking inside of plastic package inside cardboard mailer... I will get another bottle, instead of a replacement, because I don't want to package and return a leaking bottle, I will report later on how the product works on car dash.	-1
I used this for years on my car dash and other vinyl areas of the interior. I always thought it worked and protected pretty well although it does evaporate on to the inside of the windshield, which is annoying. It also doesn't seem to last very long and as it starts wearing off, the dash looks very dry.  I've since found&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/303-Aerospace-Protectant-32oz/dp/B004YJQE0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">303 Aerospace Protectant 32oz</a>, and that works much better. It doesn't seem to exhibit any of the aforementioned issues, ie., it doesn't seem to go on to the inside of the windshield, and the shine lasts longer.  It also protects from UV just as well, if not better.  Note that Vinylex contains silicone, which actually damages the vinyl/plastic over time.   I'm definitely sold on 303 Protectant over Vinylex now although I really like the Lexol pH leather cleaner and Lexol leather conditioner for my leather.	-1
Used Vinylex for my Jeep top to try it. Product does a nice job of restoring shine to plastic and vinyl and it holds up well. Gave it two stars though, because when it rains, the run off from the vinyl roof coated with vinylex leaves streaks and a film on the windows. Too bad it does not run off the vehicle in a rain storm.	-1
Vinylex is a great product for use on my classic cars that have vinyl seats. The problem was from the company that sold it to me. First they shipped a bottle of Plastic X,which is not for vinyl but clear plastic,it cost half the price and really is useless to me. So I shipped it back to them at more than six dollars expence to me. They have yet to pay me back. Later I found out that you can order it from Walmart on line and pick it up at your local Walmart.	-1
Works good for turning vinyl looking new but supposed to clean as well?  I could have rubbed with plain water and got same results as far as cleaning goes.  Not worth the money if you are looking for protection and cleaning both.  DH-60 is misleading cause it's not uv60 but maybe closer to UV-10 rating?  I gave it below average cause it's supposed to do both clean and protect and jury still out on protect. Good luck	-1
I used it on decent-looking leather seats of a 2003 Toyota Sienna.  I bought both the cleaner and the conditioner and used them as described. Even if they did what they are supposed to do, I did not realize that. It has not made a difference appearance-wise. Hopefully the treatment will help keep them alive longer. Do I regret buying them? No. I do not.	-1
I've used Lexol cleaner before on my Rx7 seats (from the open bottle).  This time i decided to get some conditioner on the BMW.  Well first of all this product does not need a spray bottle. It would have been easier in just an open container.  When you spray it goes everywhere, the back parcel shelf, the windows, the carpet.  Its hard to be precise with it. After reading the reviews, lots of people said it felt non-sticky, i disagree.  It was very tacky and disgusting.  I will get something else to replace this with.	-1
Stains and change color of leather	-1
Overpriced old clumpy stock. This stuff couldn't be sold in retail store since its no good, so lets sell it online here where your guaranteed to get B grade items for a good price	-1
Applied this to my leather dining set. Goes on nicely...kind of a white creamy stuff...looks like....well, anyway.  Made the leather look really nice. B U T- This stuff does not dry!  The chairs are all sticky now. I tried re-wiping them off after about 1 hour with a nice dry towel- no dice!  They simply stay waxy and sticky feeling.  And this was true on several different chairs from different manufacturers. Yes, I imagine it IS a good moisturizer...BUT! I had to put a towel down to even sit on the chairs afterwards.  I'm used to a product that goes on like this one did- but then DRIES -and can then easily be buffed to a shine, almost like car wax. This goo is more like buffing HONEY.  Back it goes....	-1
I'd like to review this product for its efficacy on cleaning my brakes, but unfortunately my can came without a nozzle extension. Given that I'd rather not spray this all over the side of my wheel and tire (there's a reason they include a nozzle, as I'm sure this is pretty bad for rubber and paint) I have no idea if this works as well as they say it does. But I can say their quality control needs to be improved...	-1
bought a second one waited super long this time and it didn't even come with the straw	-1
Highly recommend you wear a respirator and protective eye glasses when using this because this stuff stinks and I doubt is good for you if you breathe it in.  Besides that, disappointed in this product, what do you need 20 cans to clean brake calipers?  I used a full can pretty quickly, it did clean the calipers, ever so slightly, but I was expecting more cleaning, especially since this stuff is suppose to be potent and in some states required to be shipped by ground.  Oh well...	-1
Ran out quit	-1
For a company that has touted it's rep for many years, they should be ashamed that they sell a product as poorly made as these lights.  Oh yes, they worked fine as backup lights, and the install kit is nice.  BUT......they leak water and the reflector, which seems to be some kind of cheapo foil rusts and disintergrates. I would recommend staying away from these unless you want to replace them every few years. One star for the short period of use I got out of them. SMH at KC......	-1
These lights die not perform like the manufacturer said. They thru out a narrow beam instead of the wide flood that they should have.	-1
*** See update at the end of this review  I purchased these for my 2012 F150 pickup.  Anyone who has a recent model F150 knows what I am talking about - the back-up lamps on that vehicle are decorative at best - they throw no light behind the vehicle.  I also tow a 30' travel trailer, so having bright floodlights that throw backup light off to the side is nice since backing into a campsite at night is always tricky.  So the lights are mounted at an angle.  The package comes with everything you need - wiring, relay, etc.  I have my own wiring harness and control module, so I didn't use the included relay or wiring.  I was really only interested in the lights.  Installation on the F150 is very easy, because the vehicle already has mounting holes in the trailer hitch frame.  I am guessing the engineers at Ford anticipated this requirements.  It took me about 30 minutes to install the lights and connect them to my pre-wired harness.  I was immediately disappointed with the light they threw.  These are *NOT* flood lights, as  advertised.  They are spot lights.  They throw a tightly focused spot beam, which means they only illuminate a narrow region of the field of view behind me as I back up.  They are *NOT* at all suitable as back-up lights.  They are so limited in their field of illumination that I am taking them off the truck, and I will mount them on the back of the trailer itself.  I will buy better replacement lights for the truck - probably wide field LED lights.  If I hadn't cut the wires to splice into my existing wiring harness, I would have returned these.  I recommend you do *NOT* purchase these as back-up lights.  *** Update - June 2015 ==================  These lights continued to disappoint.  The reflective coating inside the housing rusted, causing the lights to lose their brightness.  When I finally removed the lights to replace them with "SHANREN DSquare 18w 1260lm 6 Cree XBD Flood Led Work Light Bar Off-road SUV Boat 4x4 Jeep Lamp 4wd" (See separate review), the plain steel nuts and bolts on the KC HiLiTES were so rusted it was impossible to unscrew them.  WD-40 and a blow torch could not loosen them.  Why they would not use stainless steel bolts is beyond me.  In the end, I had to cut the bolts off, which was not at all easy, considering how little room there was to work with.  I reduced my rating to one star.  Avoid this product.	-1
What good is quick delivery when you get your items and they are not as described in Amazons advertisement for whats in the kit.  I ordered the KC516 and KC517 kits, The KC516 is a complete kit, exactly as advertised.  The KC517 is not the same as described, The instructions state your have to order the auxiliary wiring harness(KC 6303, add on kit) which has a switch to turn on and off the lights, THIS IS IMPORTANT for anyone that may backup into water, you can't turn off the lights and you could short out your electrical system.  Also absent is the KC light covers and the 2 other sets of lens. All that stuff comes with the KC516 set.  If you don't need the switch, lens,and covers, then you will like these lights, mine are still in the box because I need that switch but I really liked the quality of the lights for the price.  I'm going to demand Amazon honor it ad. I like the kit that much, I don't want to send it back.  It's Amazons mistake and they need to correct their description of the product on their site.  I hope Amazon places this review in the most helpful category because you need to know about the differences in the kits.  For your reference the KC516 is $92 and the KC517 is $66 They are both the same size, but only the 517 is for reverse and has flood light lens.  Otherwise the 516 would be a better deal with all the extras it come with. UP DATE:  Either send them back or they charge you full price and won't send the missing parts.  I'm making a report to our State Attorney General for Consumer Affairs.  Please do the same if it happens to you.  They know of the problem, yet they don't fix it!  False and misleading advertising and its intentional.	-1
Trash.  6000 lb holding capacity but you can easily move the rod around and drop all of the weight.  Before even putting them on my car I put them to full height and accidentally hit the release bar, crushing my finger and cutting it horribly. It has been like 20 minutes but the pain is still here. These are extremely unsafe like the other reviewers say. If you are going to be working under the car, I wouldn't trust my life with a $20 piece of shit product. GO with the double pin locking jack for a safer experience.	-1
I have to admit I never used them, they looked like they were welded by a 3 year old, I was unwilling to trust them.  Not sure if they are authentic or some sort of counterfeit product, but these were really poor quality.	-1
For the price you may be able to find 3 ton jack stands. These are  small and make me concerned when I am under my vehicle. The feet are not cast for a firm base. These stands will mark or cut into the floor as the feet are just cut off metal angle iron that form the jack stand.	-1
Works fine but bought it as brand new and had obvious scuff marks all around. Probably used a bit seeing how it's still pretty fresh for the most part.	-1
Low quality steel results in instant bending of materials. Total safety hazard and not safe for any sized car. Avoid and purchase higher quality jack stands	-1
After I placed the order I accidentally found out Walmart is selling exactly the same item with the same brand for less than $7 apiece.	-1
I can't believe that these are sold ANYWHERE, let alone on Amazon.  These are hideously poorly constructed stands that look like they were welded by someone who just learned how to weld that day.  Seriously!  To compound the insult to my intelligence as a consumer, the weld lines are covered by a label on the outside.  Brilliant way to hide your sins Torin.  I returned these within five minutes of opening the box.  I cannot believe that anyone other than someone on a suicide mission would endeavor to use these to support anything beyond an ATV.  DO NOT buy this garbage, I don't care how good other reviews may be.  If you just can't resist the "value", do yourself a favor and look at the two garbage welds that are between you and 1.5 tons on your chest..... and then consider how safe you feel.	-1
Very poor weld quality, Don't risk your life!	-1
Terrible quality wields. Looked like whoever did it hates his life and did not care if the car collapsed on whoever that uses it.  I'm not saying that they won't be able to hold a car's weight, I'm just saying I'm not gonna trust them for me to stick my head working under the car.	-1
I've had these for two years, and the quality seemed ok at first.  I've put my car on four of these a few times (3200lb car) and have been able to get under the front of the car, or do stuff to the suspension/brakes with the wheel off.  Unfortunately, when I was using these yesterday, I noticed that one of them was bending to one side about 5~10 degrees.  The jackstand was extended "7 notches" but well within it's operating range, so it should not be bending.  The other 3 I have were ok and not bending, but are now suspect for obvious reasons.  This is not acceptable for a jack stand.  The lesson here is... buy something that is good quality so you only have to buy it once.	-1
Bed quality, not safety!	-1
Looks like it's not sturdy under my suv I leave the jack under it just in case	-1
I tried these but they didn't stand flat so I returned them.	-1
It was difficult to use it with my BMW 525.	-1
The jacks are yellow, not red. They don't really go as high as I'd like them to. Also, the cradles that hold the car up have a deep half-circle groove in-between some flat areas that are just a bit too far apart to hold my Jeep's main body frame safely. I ended up buying a 6-ton set at O-Riley's in town that are a much better set for close to the same price as these. Not only are they safer (it's unlikely that the Jeep will slip off a poorly designed stand top), they'll also go up higher and hold more weight. I might look into returning these because I just don't think I'll use them ever again.	-1
For routine maintenance these will get you by but for anything more serious like timing belts and clutches look elsewhere. 2 stars may seem a little harsh but the stand's base is very narrow which will make them tip very easily and also the will dent the concrete you are working on. It isn't the fault of the jacks alone, when the concrete gets dented, but since the bottom of the stands disperse their weigh over a small area it makes it near impossible for them not to dent the ground(they should have made the bottom continuous not 4 individual feet). Also the part that makes contact with the car has the same problem since they aren't flat at the top they tend to leave small dents under the car which isn't a big deal but it makes me uneasy since they can easily fold while the load is settling because of movement on the ground and where it makes contact with the car. I also can't think of a car that matches the profile of the top of the jack stands because the dip is very shallow.	-1
Meh.  They were fine, but looked a little too flimsy to me.  I went to the 'discount hardware' store locally and got 6 ton jacks that were much more significant.	-1
The construction is ok but the locking mechanism on one on the units does not work.	-1
I ordered and paid for next day air because I needed it this weekend.  It arrived, but it wasn't what I ordered.  I ordered a pair of jack stands.  I received an engine hoist leveler.  I understand mistakes happen.. but it was the way the return has been handled that I have issues with.  UPS dropped it off, but I have to take it to the post office to send it back?  And I wasn't told if they'll wait to ship the right order until they receive this back via the slowest mail service.. so I have no idea when the replacement order will arrive.  A week?  Two weeks?  This wasn't my mistake or even a defective product.. this was human error on their part.  They should have told me they'd IMMEDIATELY ship the replacements next day like I ordered.  So far I'm left hanging.  Should I go out locally and get what I need and then end up with an extra set?  Should I hold off a day because they're coming next day?  I don't know.. and that's the point and that's why I gave them one star.	-1
THE JACK STANDS FELL WITH NOTHING ON THEM WHEN I BARELY SHOOK THEM. MADE IN CHINA JUNK. WASTE OF TIME. IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE BUY AMERICAN JACK STANDS.	-1

I got mine for christmas from my Amazon wish list. It replaced another AGM battery I bought from Autozone that showed low voltage during start up so I thought I better replace it. I wish I hadnt recycled it because new the Odyssey battery also showed low voltage on start up and after 5 months died completely. I have a volt meter on the bike and pay attention to it. My bike charges at 14.3 Volts, and I ride it 40 minutes 2-4X a week. There is no drain on the electrical system when parked but after a 2 week vacation I came home to a dead battery. I put it on a battery tender overnight and it showed a surface voltage of 13.4V. The voltage dropped to 7V on attempted startup and only returned to 11V. After the second attempt it only returned to 10V.  This battery is crap.  Because I didn't buy it locally I cant get an immediate replacement.  Because it was a gift, I don't have a receipt and cant get it warrantied.  Update! 7/2016 I replaced the battery with another and this one is now leaking.  It is mounted on its side in a KLR 650. I don't ride it often but i still keep an eye on the voltage and put it on the battery tender for a day or two every couple weeks.  Last month i noticed a small puddle under the bike after sitting on the tender for the night. It was battery acid. Update! 8/2016 I spoke with Odyseey. They say battery tender brand battery chargers will ruin their batteries. Maybe not the best choice for vehicles that won't be used often then. Very dissapointed.	-1
This battery was specified for my bike (Triumph Rocket III). 1st it was too small and needed spacers to fit correctly. I made sure it was charged and keep it on a float charger. It stranded me twice within 2 weeks. If the outside temperature was below 45 degrees, better have jumper cables and a good samaritain to give a filthy biker a jump start. Good luck with that late at night! Glad they don't make smoke detector batteries. Stick with a lead acid AGM made in the USA. Amazon did take care of the refund immediately, made it easy, and provided great customer service.	-1
Wrong size for BMW	-1
I have the version that you can put in powersports vehicles, in this case it was in my Jet Ski.  It was purchased in June of 2014.  I noticed last fall that it wasn't retaining it's charges very well.  So I let it sit for 4  months and it was charged before removing it from my Ski.  I've tried to charge it several times with two different chargers and one of them was an Optimate 6 which is supposed to help save batteries but it wouldn't hold a charge.  I'm really baffled at how a battery that is less than two years old can go bad???? These Odyssey batteries and supposed to be able to be stored and not lose any power or go bad, but this was not case for this particular battery.  I cannot take it back to the dealer I bought it from because I no longer live in that area.  Maybe it's just hype or I just got unlucky.........but odyssey batteries disappointed me greatly.	-1
wrong  size	-1
Battery wouldn't hold a charge and had to be replaced on the road... I expected a longer lasting life (just 1 year) from my Odyssey battery. I had to buy a replacement battery from a BMW dealer while on a road trip.	-1
Very short life.	-1
This battery lasted less than 12 months before it had to be replaced.	-1
Lasted from October 9, 2013 to November 9, 2014.  I got this for my garage door opener backup.  Normally these batteries will last 5 to 7 years, but you are better off replacing them while they are still good because when it comes to alarms and getting the garage door open during a power failure if they don't work.  Each year for the alarm and two years for the garage door.  If you have both a garage door backup and an alarm buy one new batter each year and put the new one in the alarm and the old one in the garage door.	-1
The battery in my little handheld vacum cleaner slowly lost its mojo, It would not accept a charge and was just worn out. A quick Google search turned up this replacement battery in a slightly larger capacity of 1.4Ah as compared to the OEM's 1.3Ah.  The size was identical to the OEM battery. I installed it, charged it and my little vacum cleaner started working again.  Unfortunately the battery soon fizzeld out and now will not even fully charge. My handhelp vacum will operate for about 30 seconds before slowing down and stopping. So for the price, it lasted about 2 months and is now useless.  Lesson learned. No more cheap replacement batteries for me.	-1
This battery lasted 13 months then died. Supposed to be a good battery I have two of them like it in my truck and they work fine this one died. Will not buy again.	-1
Arrived dead. Won't recharge on AGM rated charger.	-1
Does not fit a Kawasaki teryx 4 like it says it does. Terminals are on the wrong sides. Battery is wider and shorter so it does not fit the battery tray and the hold down clamp cannot be used to hold the battery. This is the 2nd battery I have ordered from here and the second that is wrong. I gave up and modified the tray and made a new hold down bracket to keep from having to ship another battery back at my expense.	-1
This battery arrived yesterday and it claims to have 900 CCA. I tested it with 3 different battery testers and the best I can get is is 445 CCA half of what it is rated for. The testing was after I left it on a smart trickle charger all night. This is installed in a boat with a 454 chevy and will start it but has nothing extra to give. There are 2 PC925 installed in the boat. I cranked the engine with the fuel pump relay pulled out and it cranked for about 40 seconds before it dropped off. My problem is it is a aluminum boat and the battery boxes are welded in and will not take a real battery. May be good for a ATV or something small but not advisable to take to sea. The last 2 PC925 batterys only lasted 3 years. The terminals are horrible held on with  6 mm screws. Overpriced.  The manufacturer will not warrantee these unless they are purchase from a brick and mortar store. Buy a optmia that will out work and out preform 2 of these for a lot longer	-1
I BOUGHT ONE OF THESE VECTOR AND IT WOULD NOT WORK WRIGHT.I WOULD NOT WANT ANYONE ELSE TO GET WHAT I GOT FOR NOTHING.JUST LOST MY MONEY.	-1
In short, compared to the Equus 3721 Battery and Charging System Monitor for about $4 more, this thing sucks. It's poorly made; the display varies in the voltage it shows based on how much you swivel the head. The LEDs don't display correctly.  I bought this AND the Equus 3721 Battery and Charging System Monitor and have compared them side by side in the same vehicle and 12 V power outlet. The Equus wins HANDS DOWN. The display on this one is VERY difficult to see, it's faint and fades in and out. I would not recommend this 12v monitor to anybody even if it was the only one on the market.  Bottom line:  Avoid this one. It's bad news. The Equus 3721 Battery and Charging System Monitor is much better. I bought both with the intentions to test and use the one I felt best on my MOTORCYCLE, and I'm happy with the Equus. At $11 it's not worth sending back so I am going to toss it in the trash. But probably not before I make a video of it comparing it to the other unit.	-1
This LCD meter has been driving me crazy. I've been trying to debug my electrical system because it indicates 11.9 volts when at the battery I get 12.6 volts with two different multimeters. The trouble is with this crappy device that indicates eratically, sometimes 12.7 and other times at 11.4. It's taken me several hours to find out the problem is with this device. You'd be better off to get a real 12 volt meter.	-1
piece of crap takes 10 seconds to trigger, stays on for 2 seconds, then turns off. what a damn waste of money	-1
worked for about 5 minutes then stopped working as advertized, always on even with no switch signal. installed a kill switch instead.	-1
So far it does not appear to be working correctly. There is +11V on the output (blue wire) with +13.6 on the yellow wire. The output is there no matter what is on the signal input (green wire). Rats!!!! I would like to get this install finalized... I will contact PAC tech support and more than likely be returning/replacing this unit.	-1
I knew just by looking at this thing that it was cheap but it was the only double-din mount I could find for a '97 Ford Explorer. All other mounts were single-din. When it arrived, it was everything that I expected, cheap, cheap, and cheap. Only buy this unit if you have no other alternative.	-1
Guess this might be of use to someone.  But for me it was un-needed.  But I also didn't use the mounting sleeve that came with the radio either.  The quality of the parts looked OK, but will probably sit on the shelf until I finally toss it in the garbage.	-1
Not too happy with it. Would not fit completely over my pioneer double din. Had to dremmel but didn't do it. Tossed it and got a metra.	-1
Almost Worthless; the wire is very small gauge and a number of the jumpers didn't even have continuity between the clips.  Don't waste your money on these; go to Radio Shack, or make your own.	-1
I had to solder every alligator clip to the lead.  Not well made.	-1
Bad connections between thin copper wire and the alligator clip due to a crimp connection, as opposed to a soldered connection. Not able to buy good quality alligator clips and make my own test leads anymore!  You can't beat a soldered wire to clip test lead!  All of mine wore out....after about 30 years!	-1
ALL the yellows are OPEN - really caused me a problem until I figured out my new test leads were no good	-1
Junk to be avoided.  The wires are not actually soldered to the metal clips, they are just crimped against the wire insulation plastic.  As the plastic creeps, electrical connection is lost.  I started repairing these things, then realized that it's cheaper to throw them in trash and get better quality elsewhere.	-1
Cheap product.  Don't waste your time/money.  Buy something else.  Very cheap quality.  Even to get the alligator clip to open it's a PITA, it will slide off your fingers.  Garbage. Not worth returning it to China either.	-1
no connection on over half of the leads, removed all alligators and soldered to new line.	-1
In my opinion... Mere trinkets at best. Clips not soldered, and wire not marked as depicted in ad photo. Cheap cheap cheap, not even worth the $2.45 by a long shot, plus their slow boat journey from the 'far east' took better than a month. Save your money, time and aggravation, look elsewhere or make your own.	-1
Total junk. Fully one half are not connected, only crimped on insulation. The rest are doomed to fall apart in use. The fix... disassemble the alligator clips and solder to real test lead wire.	-1
DO NOT BUY.  The alligator clips were crimped right over the wire's insulation so there's no continuity between clips on the same wire.  So these are useless.  Obviously, the quality of the alligator clips is garbage, as well.  I should have known better considering how cheap they were, but I wish I had my $3 back.	-1
Ok so I received these leads to complete some testing on solar lights that were not working well in my yard.  When I first attached the leads to see if the solar cell were generating any voltage or enough to recharge the batteries I was surprised to find they were dead.  However I was sure they were producing some activity in full sun, so I proceeded to check the leads for continuity.  To my surprise only three of the leads were actually connected to the alligator clips electrically even though the wires were firmly crimped to the clips.  The fact that there was not one drop of solder on any of the clips was immediately evident.  Obviously none of these leads were subjected at the point of manufacture to a simple continuity test before being sent out. I guess for the price this was not surprising  Unless you are willing to disassemble the wires and solder them on you run the risk of having to throw these leads out.  I did fix them all,  but I think you would be better served buying from a more reliable vendor.  I will say they came direct from China sooner than was forecast.  So unless you enjoy tearing these apart and reworking them I would pass.	-1
Poor quality clips. They slide around when you attempt to compress them open. Super slowboat from China shipping speed too.	-1
Crap. Wires not soldered to clips. Clips Pull off easy	-1
Took 2 months and not worth it!	-1
Wire is stripped, placed under insulation and crimped. About 30 % failures...open connection at clip. Wire is about 4 thin strands. Only way to use them is to take ends apart, re-strip, solder, re-crimp. Don't buy. Spend more, get better ones.	-1
Terrible quality!  Some machine or person simply tried to jam two points of cheap steel through what is a fairly thick insulation on the cord.  Four of them actually conducted "electricity"...the other six not so much...that makes for an unimpressive 60% failure rate.  I soldered the bad ones myself.  The look great in the photos but underneath that alligator clip = FAIL -- even the alligator clips themselves are duds - some riveted correctly, others with missing rivets.	-1
wire gauge is too small and breaks at alligator clip. The worst part is the break is unknown to the user because its under the covering, which makes you think the item our "jumping" or testing has failed when in fact the wire is broken. Pure crap, don't buy. maybe for some small computer type jobs... but as an HVAC tech they sucked Oregon	-1
Short leads and the alligator clips are very slippery.  You have to remove the cover to get a grip on it.	-1
I don't like these because it's almost impossible to squeeze the gators open. It's like someone sprayed WD-40 on the inside of the boot. Every time you squeeze them they spin in the boot.	-1
I have a strong finger grip, but I find it nearly impossible to open the jaws of these clips because the insulation around the alligator clamp is extremely slippery.  So you press your fingers together and the outer plastic slides around and the jaws don't open.  You need two hands to attach a lead.  Sure one can slide back the cover and work with no insulation, and perhaps make a connection if you have the room to do so without shorting out the circuits surrounding what you wish to connect.  I wanted to spread the alligator across the head of a screw in a screw block (head of screw 3/16" - 1/4") and had to struggle to do so.  I had to make 5 lead connections, and it was a real struggle.  I don't trust the connection of the clip.  With a semi- EE background and many engineering projects, I've worked with quality connector leads.  I should have recognized that China was the source, and in my experience, they manufacture untrustworthy junk (in nicely wrapped packages). I will seek professional sources instead.  These have been thrown in the trash!  Complete waste of money.	-1
Pretty much worthless.  The clip shields are so slippery that you have to remove them before you can use the clip itself.  If you try to open the clip the clip shield just slips to the point you can't open the clip.  Also, the length is to short to be of any use.	-1
Junk 30ga. wire that is just stripped, bent over and kinda crimped into the alligator clip. If you want some decent test leads, go ahead and get these but change the wire to 18ga. and solder the clips on.	-1
I recently purchases these to fill out my complement on 2 workbenches and seemed to work OK but then I had to use them in a circuit where there was a few amps and found out that the wire they use is 26ga or smaller and the ends are not soldered in to the clips.  this resulted in a horrible voltage drop and brought their use to a halt.  They will work on very low voltage and current applications but you need to open them all up and solder the wires in to reduce internal resistance.  Given that,  you can buy test lead wire and aligator clips and make some good ones.  beware.	-1
Worked out	-1
Cheap cheap cheap and I will add cheap.	-1
junk	-1
The insulating sleeve over the alligator clip are either just very slippery on the inside or have some kind of lube on the inside.  When you try to pinch the alligator to open the jaws, the alligator clip rotates 90 degrees and, of course, does not open.  It takes two hands to open them, one to stabilize the alligator jaws and the other to squeeze it  open.  Then you try to get the jaws onto something before they rotate 90 degrees inside the insulating sleeve and close.  More than half of them were in this condition and are useless.	-1

When i ordered the bottle the info was about " 4 OUNCE " bottle, the photo here in the ad is edited, down under the 2 lines warning the weight is deleted, compare the real product photo with the ad photo and you will know what i mean ... the photo was edited and the 3 ounce ( 85 g ) Net WT was deleted .	-1
Did not do anything	-1
This is a not R134A charger although that is what I searched for and is labeled as"FJC 9140 Refrigerant - 4 oz."  It is actually 3 oz. This will not recharge AC like other 134A chargers with stop leak. Its mores Stop leak with a breath of freon. Very disapointed	-1
I had a leak that completely emptied my AC in 48hrs. I never detected any of this dye coming out of the system. I replaced the seals on the back of the compressor and all the O-rings. This stopped the leak. These parts cost only about $14, so you're better off just replacing all the seals if you have a leak. If one seal is leaking, all of them are close to failing. If that doesn't work, then the compressor is leaking internally.	-1
Did not seem to help the vibration from my torque converter at highway speeds ........ not even with two tubes added.  Worth a try though and definitely less expensive on Amazon than in a store.	-1
Lasted only a few weeks	-1
Did absolutely nothing. I even flushed and filled with new fluid and filter.	-1
garbage but the only thing they got for it, I'm at their mercy... gotta spend $8 every year or so and a half a day putting them in... made in taiwan crap	-1
Not the quality I expected from Doorman. They used to have nice decent quality aftermarket parts......not anymore. These were installed by a body shop that allowed me to bring in my own parts. These lasted less than a year. Very disappointed. Between their tailgate handles poor quality and being junk and now these not holding up....I will be sticking to  AC Delco or another reputable brand for keeping the  old Chevy running. Junk parts are not worth the hassle of dealing with. I will gladly pay more for a QUALITY part.	-1
did not work	-1
Waist of time and money  I did everything it said. I had a seeping hole around a plug that someone tried to patch with bondo. I cleaned it off and buffed it down with a Scotch Brite pad then sanded it  and wiped it with the wipe provided. SEVERAL hours later it seeped out the edges worse that it did with the bondo I put another layer on a bit wider still no good. Used the last of the tube and it still leaks. NEXT !!!!	-1
buuuhhh	-1
Seems to still leak. Save your money and buy a new tank.	-1
Forget about removing body-oil stains. This is a superficial cleaner. I applied it liberally and several times over, even let it soak an hour before giving up. It's in the recycle bin now.	-1
Kill a rattlesnake; squeeze the oil out of it; add to transmission; same result, get it?	-1
This was a total waste of money. The product was unusable because the "hardener" was solid and brittle - not pliable as it was supposed to be. It was impossible to mix the two parts together.	-1
I would give this 0 stars if possible.  At least the pin is made of metal.  I have yet to figure out what the bushings are made of, they disintegrated while trying to install them.  Extremely poor excuse of a part.  Don't waste your money on these, you will just end up frustrated and have to go buy OEM parts from GM.	-1
I replaced the upper and lower hinge pins on my '99 suburban.  The lower hinge upper bushing (with the larger hole) broke and fell down the shaft.  It was easy to install the pin, and in fact I as able to insert the pin all the way to the knurled portion by hand.  It only broke after pounding it in.  I was able to push the broken piece back to the top of the shaft, but I don't know if it will last.  I will not be happy if I have to do them again.  It seems the bushings are some sort of cast bronze (pot metal) and very low quality.	-1
Did not work, I would honestly say the car shudders more than pre install of dr tranny, Town and country 2002	-1
Didn't work. System has a relative small leak, 3 weeks to empty, this product didn't make a diference	-1
Useless, when you're done using it the threaded yellow pan then goes back into the center.  That green cap is where it threads in to get drain oil into the tank.  When you're done, you cannot move the container up right to empty because residual oil runs down the front of it.  It's a mess now matter how you do it.  I wasted a lot of shop towels cleaning up.  Worthless product.	-1
It holds loads of oil and is very slim to fit under my car which has an annoying ground effects package - but it came with a two hidden holes on the bottom that made for one super messy oil change with 6 quarts of nasty oil draining down the driveway. The holes appear to be where the mold or cast was injected and the plastic was "melted" and deformed. Quality control was obviously lacking.	-1
I don't know what to make of this... I bought this oil drain pan (I used to own the same model and lost it in a move). Not long after I changed the oil on my car, this tub started leaking. I have no idea if it was the product or some gremlin came along and punched a pinhole in it. Doesn't matter. It should leak and I shouldn't have to clean oil off my garage floor.	-1
Did nothing to solve the shudder problem.  So I checked with Lubegard and they said it was compatible with my transmission (i.e...should work).  I drained the fluid and installed AMSOIL high MPG and the shudder problem went away.  So you have to wonder what in this product?	-1
The backing on this cushion is C H E A P!  Mine has begun to disintegrate and blow off in the wind. I will not buy this cushion again.	-1
terrible quality	-1
after all the review, i tried this, gave it awhile and made no change in the transmission on a dodge dakota.	-1
Horrible does not whiten white wall or writing on tire this is like just spraying water and whipping off.	-1
While this product gets dirt off your white walls, it also turns them pale yellow and also damages chrome so my hubcaps are now damaged. I threw out the bottle and I'll go back to SOS pads.	-1
Does NOT clean white walls at all!  No better than soap and water.	-1
Read the reviews and tried this to whiten wide whitewalls on classic cars and it did nothing.  Tried another brand in a black bottle that foamed and you could watch the yellow stains float off of the whitewalls.  We stocked up on the other brand.....	-1
They have  picture of all 3 hoses, the set. Yet its just for the yellow hose.	-1
Just didn't help at all, tranny in the shop right now to be rebuilt. Would not recommend to my friends.	-1

it didn't really leave it white like i wanted it.	-1
This product seemed to make no difference at all in my 1995 Saturn automatic transmission. I used one tube, and after not experiencing any improvement, used another tube several weeks later. No joy.  I didn't expect miracles, mind you. It's only an additive. But I had hoped for at least some improvement. Still, it's cheap enough that I guess it was worth a try.	-1
I gave this item two stars at first..... but now after 4 days, and less than 100 miles - it is starting to come unraveled and bare wire is poking through the seat portion.	-1
The material has torn and the elastic strap has broken. Although comfortable it wore out much too quickly.	-1
Cover came apart after not too much use.  Bummer.	-1
Does not fit a 1999 F550 7.3L .	-1
Was able to make the kit work. I needed 8 of them for my 1996 Ford  250 crew cab. The bushings are of poor quality and very brittle so be careful not to drop them. Once installed they will probably last from a wear standpoint. The kit is advertised as working on upper and lower door hinges for both front and rear doors. This is true for the front doors and upper hinge on the rear doors. The lower rear door hinge is a different matter.  The OD of the bushing holes on the lower hinge is smaller than all the other hinges. It required removal and boring out the lower hinges to make the bushings fit and the kit usable.  Note this problem is for a 1996 crew cab install, I do not know about other models.	-1
Did not come close to fitting properly.  After disassembly of vehicle, measured and found correct units for my vehicle.	-1
I used this for 1 week and it literally came apart at the seams! It's now being held together with Duct-tape!!	-1
cheaply made. Fabric tore, seams split  after about 2 weeks of mild use.	-1
Did not fit my 89 Chevy 1500	-1
PC of JUNK!!! It fell apart in 2 weeks!!!! The material started to unravel itself, and then you start feeling the cheap material underneath it	-1
I'm a mail carrier, and ordered this for my mail truck. Looks good and was comfortable to sit on, and provided excellent airflow.  However, with my constantly getting in and out of my truck, it has accelerated the wear on the fabric and some of the steel springs are starting to show.  If you are not abusive to the product, it will probably last a year	-1
works as it should	-1
UPDATED REVIEW: TAKE AWAY ANOTHER STAR! SUPER Low quality components?  Doesn't work properly! There are fewer capacitors to run the wiper delay, which also saves maybe 30 cents per unit, but they suck really bad compared to the OEM. The last Doorman wiper delay board was made in Korea, and was markedly higher quality. This one is made from inferior quality capacitors, & transistors, then dipped in so much epoxy, so no one can possibly repair it, and it is not likely to last very long. 2 weeks later and this is already not working like the OEM part. I cleaned up the old board replaced some parts and re-used it. Typical Dorman junk parts. Not the same circuit as the OEM board at all. This has 3 transistors. The OEM has 5. This has 3 electrolytic caps. The OEM has 5. The OEM also has two brick type caps .22uF rated at 250 VAC the Dorman lacks. It's a one size kinda sorta might fit your car replacement. TYPICAL DORMAN JUNK! I rebuilt Nissan ECMs after the earthquake in Japan. The same parts failed in every single unit, and repairs cost about $1 for parts and $15 for labor. Return rate: <0.05% . Return rate on replacement ECMs: <24%. If you keep making the parts with the same fatal flaws they will continue to fail. Dorman, not to be outdone, incorporates the same flaws and adds some more flaws. The lack of parts in this makes the delay settings go from 4 settings to the same as 2. The slowest setting is about every 9 1/2 seconds, the next one is about every 8 seconds, then it jumps to every 3  seconds and every 2 seconds. The OEM had a more linear response, between settings. Typical "how cheap can we get it made in Asia?", Dorman garbage. THIS VERSION ONLY WORKS ON ABOUT 35% OF THE DELAY SETTINGS ON A LUXURY EDITION OF A 1999 CHEVY BLAZER WITH POWER COMPUTER EVERYTHING! MY WIPERS WORK< BUT NOT LIKE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO! HALF THE SETTINGS DON'T DO ANYTHING AT ALL! A MORON WHO CAN COUNT PARTS WOULD UNDERSTAND WHY! DORMAN MAKES GARBAGE! THIS IS ONE OF THEIR WORST PRODUCTS EVER!	-1
Definitely not the right part Specs for the application were correct.. Wrong size, doesn't fit the mounting bracket. Too late to return;Trusted the part to be correct - won't happen again. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002JMUZW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1	-1
Comfortable. In a very short time the material has broken and the wire is showing. Not durable. Not worth it.	-1
Threads seized up after 4 uses damaged threads beyond use	-1
The unit I received blasted the flush out like a garden hose rather than producing a fine mist with which to clean my A/C components. Ended up using a friends flush kit to get the project done, Requested a return on this unit and it was honored.	-1
There's metal flakes coming from the threads of the bottle and it contaminated the flush fluid, a condenser and some lines that we were trying to flush.  We noticed the rental kit from Autozone had the same problem though.  Also the rubber tip had to be modified so it had more taper and so it actually fit inside the end of the line.  Other than that it works.  My tech said that there were burrs on the threads which needed to be smoothed out so it would stop making metal flakes.  Not as happy with the purchase as I thought I would be since it ruined some expensive parts.	-1
Not a good product, very uncomfortable. Ended up tossing it. I was hoping it was like the old ones they used to sell back in the 70's that were actually comfortable and cool on those old vinyl seats - not the case with this product.	-1
The Spray nozzle leaked the second time i try to use it, only had it for about 2 weeks. the nozzle suppose to hold pressure until you pull the trigger, instead it sprayer flush solvent everywhere as soon as i open the valve. The unit itself is good quality, if you willing to upgrade the nozzle to better 1, may be pair it with Blue Point nozzle.	-1
Worked great until the cheap center straw fell off the cap. Now it won't shoot any flush. What a pain	-1
Can had fine aluminum flakes inside it. It looked clean but when I rinsed it out and dumped it in a dark pan it looked like silver paint. Be sure you rinse out can before using or you will blow aluminum through out the system. I had to flush system twice because of this.	-1
Followed the instructions to the T and does not stick for anything.	-1
After using the FJC Flush kit once, I went to refill the container and the metal tube inside fell out of the cap. I finally pounded a large nail into the tube to flare it and drove it into into the cap hole. So far it's still working. I don't know for how long.	-1
This does NOT bond metal to glass. I tried to use this product due to the great Amazon reviews to re-attach a latch on the rear sliding glass windows on a truck. Prepared the metal, primed it, waited 2-minutes, applied bead of adhesive, applied metal latch to glass (which spread the adhesive) and held for 60-seconds. Removed hand and it just dropped off (not even sticky). Try to hold for about 3-minutes. Falls right off, no tackiness or grip of any kind. It's almost like it was a lubricant in the tube, not glue! I'm not sure how people are having success with this product, but my advice would be to avoid if you're thinking this will attach something metal to glass.	-1
Waste of money, fell off minutes after holding it on the glass waiting for it to dry	-1
mine fell off . just like last time. the best is the walmart glue for about 2 bucks	-1
Lasted until I parked the car in the sun. In Michigan.... Fell off first day in sun, after being on over a week. I later found a super glue good for something like 280 degrees F.	-1
DIDN'T WORK SO WELL	-1
Applied per directions, left to dry overnight, fell off after mounting mirror next day.	-1
Glue never hardened.  It would not stay in place after the two minute hold period.  I went ahead and taped it in place overnight.  Glue was still soft in the morning.  It wiped right off.  What a waste.	-1
I followed the instructions to the letter,They're not real complicated. I don't know why they tell you to put one drop. When it fell off (5 seconds after I hung the mirror) the one drop covered one drops worth of surface. A waste of 5$.	-1
had windshield replaced. a day later, mirror popped off. bought this and figured i would try to fix myself. but within a day it was off again. had to have professional come and do it properly.	-1
Even if you follow the diections this product likely will not work just not impressed	-1
I was confused because there were two tubes.  One is a primer. and each tube is good for one use. Unlike the last tube i had that can be used several times. I just couldn't find where i put it.  I followed the directions and the glue never stuck.  i must have held it there forever. the last brand stuck so fast i almost didn't get it straight. off to the place where i bought the last tube,  it was red in color.	-1
I own a Jeep Wrangler.  The windshield is small with flat glass.  These wiper blades fit well and the rubber cover does a great job at preventing ice building up within the blade but they do a horrible job keeping the windshield clean and clear of streaks.  I will not buy them again, and would recommend against anyone purchasing these.	-1
I'm saddened with the performance of these products. I have used Trico for years.  TRICO Chill 37-160 Extreme Weather Winter Wiper Blade - 16" (Pack of 1); This went on (right side), when it was still in the 40's for a few weeks and rain tested = not full coverage, streaks on the return swipe. It's been single digits here in Ohio for a few weeks now = completely hit or miss coverage, loads of streaks from incomplete contact with glass.  TRICO Chill 37-260 Extreme Weather Winter Wiper Blade - 26" (Pack of 1) Purchase from an Amazon seller UNABLE TO LEAVE A PRODUCT REVIEW with item so I'll place it here:  This went on (left side), same performance as the 16" variety, bearing in mind it is a 26" blade which is expected to be problematic. These are awful - don't buy.  Both Useless over 60 mph	-1
not what i needed	-1
This wiper blade doesn't have any curvature to it so you only end up getting a tiny bit of contact between the wiper blade and the windshield. Its totally worthless. Its a totally straight wiper blade with no flexibility.  I'm returning it.	-1
Bought this part from autozone because I had an O2 sensor that was too long to fit in the pipe. I drilled it out and it worked just fine.  I used the second one because the 90 degree adapter on my compression tester wouldn't fit properly into the #6 cylinder on my Ford 300.  I screwed it in about one turn past hand tight.  The extra 1/2" or so let the compression tester fit, then the real fun began.  The shape of the cylinder head prevented me from getting any wrench or socket onto the non-fouler to remove it.  I put some red loc-tite on a spark plug and screwed it into the non-fouler and waited two days because I figured that the 24hr on the package was at room temperature and I wasn't working at room temperature.  The spark plug came right out.  I tried again and waited a week.  Sitting on the radiator support and rocking on a 1/2" breaker bar (also from autozone) I managed to break the spark plug and non-fouler free while removing the square drive end of the breaker bar from the area at a velocity that nearly required a change of pants.  lessons learned: cast iron and steel have different expansion rates adhesives and tool steel behave differently at -10F  I would recommend this product for stuff not involving spark plugs.	-1
Good for old cars but not anything newer with a bowed window . only made contact with about 3 inch of window not happy.. Would do good on like a older gbody but a Nissan quest no fit do not try	-1
Clumps with ice, very poor performing. In the middle of a blizzard, we had to replace this with a typical rubber covered Anco winter wiper. Trico only offered to replace the clips that hold it on.	-1
didn't fit vehicle Corolla '03	-1
Bought it to use as o2 sensor spacer and the sensor won't fit this product. It doesn't go all the way in.	-1
1. Does not actually fit to Nissan Altima 2010,but amazon marks as item that fits to the car. So I had to use some parts from old blade in order to put it in the place.  2. it looks like item was exposed to direct sunlight or some chemicals for a very long period of time. Rubber cover is not black, it's more like light gray with some black spots... picture on the site looks MUCH better than real item.  will see how it would work in winter season, but I'd probably order the other set of bosh icon blades.	-1
My Tricos left a mess on the windshield, right in my line of sight, consistently, even using significant amounts of washer fluid. When the retainer that locked the blade to the wiper arm broke, I replaced these with another brand. Much happier with my second choice, Anco.  Admittedly, I have a very flat windshield and different people might have a different experience.	-1
As others hav said it's too long when wipers are shut off it rides up on the fender on passenger side put the old one back on so I have 1 winter and 1 regular blade	-1
This is junk! Looks like old stock that has been laying around for years. does not clean the windshield, misses half of it.	-1
I've been around cars for a lifetime.  I am certainly aware of the process of changing wiper blades; it could not be more simple.  This item was properly installed and I bought it through Amazon because it is particular difficult to acquire 13 inch, winter, replacement wiper blades.  During one of our New England snow storms, the blade, literally, was launched from the wiper arm in the middle of an intersection.  Consequently, recovery was impossible.  Fortunately, I had saved the replaced unit which was not of the winter variety, but served its purpose.  Bottom Line:  I would NOT buy the product again.	-1
When I received these wiper blades they were deformed and would not conform to the fit of the windshield. I think they are selling a batch that did not pass the quality control needed to sell them in a retail brick & mortar store.	-1
I bought this because I wanted a blade that looked just like the OEM one. What's the point of a connector that looks identical if the blade looks different? All compatible blades have a connector that looks correct. My original blade had a slotted vented appearance, while this one did not. That might not be a big deal, except the other Exact Fit blade (different length) I got bought at the same time for the same car did not look like this one. Many vehicles like mine use two different length blades. Getting blades that don't match each other is not what I expected from the description. Blades might even react differently to wind based on the absence or presence of holes.  I ended up getting the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Trico-16-240-NeoForm-Wiper-Blade-with-Teflon/dp/B001BAETH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Trico 16-240 NeoForm Wiper Blade with Teflon</a>&nbsp;instead. It's not touted as an exact fit, but it matched the OEM blade very closely in appearance. The two blades of that model matched each other's appearance too. It installed in seconds, and came with extra fittings just in case it did not have the exact connector by default. The fitting did not look exactly like the OEM one, but functioned exactly like it. I'd rather have a blade that looks identical than a fitting that looks identical (but can't be seen once installed.)  Another minor quibble is that the Exact Fit blade was not the exact length of the OEM. It would not have made a difference, but the name implies that this blade is much closer to what I expected than it was. The only thing that Exact Fit means is that you can be sure that the default (and only) connector will not need to be snapped off and replaced. With other brands, you will get additional connectors that snap on and off in seconds so the blade could be adapted to any arm. If you consider that a challenge, you might consider changing any blade a challenge.  The other blade is better, and close enough in price that I can't see the point of getting this one.	-1
Chattered "skipped" when using after about a month. Tried everything I knew of to clean windshield and still had the issue. Replaced with another brand and the issue went away...	-1
Standard quality	-1
In 3 months of barely being used, it started to streak very badly. Replaced them with Bosch Icon. Will never buy Trico again.	-1
Doesn't Do The Job.. I am replacing these after just a few weeks.... they don't wipe clean....the Rain-X Weatherbeater Wiper I bought on Amazon  for my other car perform flawlessly. I just ordered them for this car too.	-1
had to return because they broke upon install	-1
I had the symptoms that this thing claims to fix, did nothing. Slight jerking when shifting still there.  Added the whole bottle, drove over 300 miles. 10x more than the 30 it required, did an ATF change with filter and yupp no difference.  I had better results with the sea foam spray. It was what first helped the jerking and caused me to try out this product.	-1
waste of money didn't notice a difference	-1
The bucket is reasonably solid but the handle is this buckets weak link. Where the wire handle connects to the bucket, the plastic is too thin. The wire handle itself could be a little thicker, but the connection point needs to most attention. This could be a good product but it has a bad design flaw.	-1
Wow! Really poor quality. Super thin construction.	-1
had wiper for 1 week and it started to rip from bottom. never have i had a wiper blade break in a week before. these blades must be 2nds or fake trico because i never had a problem like this before. save your money and buy at auto parts store	-1
Not a good product at all.  My 1 year old wipers worked better.  These leave marks and don't wipe away the water.	-1
The handle broke off day one and the bottom crack with gentle usage after a week.  Do not buy!	-1
Spend the extra money and buy a bucket that doesn't break the first time you go to use it.  I knew it was cheap but I'd still expect the handle to work.. otherwise why have one on it?	-1
my power steering still make noise i don't know if it is the produce or i waited to long	-1
My transmission was jerking when shifting from 2nd to 3rd time to time. Changing ATF did not help. I don't believe in oil additives, but today I thought I probably try something. Trans Tune had very good reviews. It cannot hurt. Right?  Wrong! I tried Trans Tune from Sea Foam. It was advertised as ATF conditioner and will help with shifting problem. I bought a can and read instruction. It says add 1/2 to 1 pint to transmission. And it also stated if transmission was going to be serviced, use it before servicing and drive at least 5 miles.  No where in instruction it said ATF needs to be replaced after using.  I opened it up, it it was very thin like water. At this point, I got a little worried because that will affect viscosity of ATF. But, I thought manufacturer of Trans Tune would know better. After adding Trans Tune, took my car to test drive. Result was transmission is jerking every time transmission is shifting down. After a while, jerking while shifting down went away (probably additive was not mixed well earlier). However, torque is not being transferred right. Much less power is transmitted to transmission, probably because viscosity of ATF got thinner. Torque converter not working properly.  Now, I have to flush ATF and costing over $100 for just ATF!. Toyota had to use T-IV, which is only sold through dealers. $10.03/qt. (Charging full list price) I had this done less than 1/2 year ago, now have to do it again.  Trans Tune may be good for flushing. Not good for permanent additive. I don't know how other people got good result out of it. They probably never changed ATF and it was already contaminated badly.  Looked up MSDS of Trans Tune and it consists of Pale Oil, Naphtha, and Isopropyl Alcohol. It is same exact chemicals in regular Sea Foam motor treatment, which you run down to vacuum line to clean throttle and valves. So, it is basically flammable solvent. Definitely not something you want inside ATF.	-1
Bucket arrived with a broken attachment point for one side of the handle, so it's pretty much useless. I think it was the result of a combination of poor packaging and cheap plastic. While 3 Gal capacity seems like a lot, in person this thing is kind of small. Maybe it would have been OK, but I'll never know because it isn't worth the hassle to return it.	-1
BROKE THE FIRST TIME IN USE, PLASTIC IS WEEK.	-1
arrived with a hole in it	-1
meh, this made my check engine light turn on the lucas engine cleaner always removed it when i used it	-1
Arrived in a huge box, very little packing materail with a crack all the way up one side of the bucket. In addition,  this bucket has an odd shape.  Not very deep, and it flares out on the top.  Quality of the plastic is not all that either.  You can buy a really nice bucket at the local home improvement store reasonably priced.	-1
It's really thin and easy broken, the handle holder broken after three time use.	-1
Fool me twice. I ordered this bucket before thinking a cheap little bucket would be perfect for a certain application.  First time it came totally cracked and destroyed.  Well it's been quite some time and I had the same thought, I figured maybe the shipping was just rough and A. has seemed to have gotten better with packing.  Well see the picture.  I just don't think this bucket is durable enough to stand up to shipping.  It's like paper thing and sure a light cheap bucket might be handy for certain applications, but you'd be better off picking it up at the $1 store.	-1
I purchased this bucket because it said it accommodates large brush heads and because of the Carrand name. When I received it, I noticed the wide opening only went about half way down into the bucket and then narrowed to the size of a normal bucket. I knew the wide brush I use for winter washes wouldn't fit all the way down into it but I planned to keep it anyway however, when carrying the bucket full of water, the handle kept popping off the bucket. Guess I should have read the reviews first as it seems this is a common complaint.	-1
Two stars because it's a plastic bucket that holds liquids without leaking.  -3 stars for arriving with a broken handle that won't reseat.  It was cheap, so not worth sending back.	-1
Like many others, the bucket arrived with a broken handle.  But, I just need a bucket that I can kick around my driveway.  It still functions as a bucket, but I was a bit upset that they shipped it broken (there is no way that it snapped during shipping...it was actually packed quite nicely).	-1
caused damage to my fuel pump	-1
