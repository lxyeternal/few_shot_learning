I switch between this and the Million Dollar tanning mousse.  I love both.	1
This is now my favorite self tanner. No streaks, nice tan and doesn't get on clothes or have a pungent smell.	1
beautiful color! looks so natural and does not have a strong smell! it dries really well that i have even slept in my white sheets with out a single stain! when used with the glove (a must have) you are left with the most amazing and natural looking tan! i used to pay $80 at the Benefit boutique everytime i wanted a spray tan and used i used this i have never gone back! this lasts longer than any spray tan and looks better	1
This truly is one of the best self tanners I've ever used. I'm super fair, about the color of paper and this gives me the most wonderful color.  It's really easy to use and goes on dark so you can see where you're putting it. I recommend, like everyone else, to moisturize first. Apply lightly on ankles, knees, hands and elbows. I had to get my husband to help me with my back, of course. I do this at night, about an hour or 2 before bed. In the morning, take a shower and the color you are left with is just fantastic. I've only had a few issues with streaking, but that's user error.  Worth the price here and definitely cheaper than stores.	1
This is my 1st experience with Ahava products and I'm very pleased. The cream wash not only smells good but also works well. I tried it for the first time last night in the shower and was surprised that it lathered nicely on the washcloth and afterwards my skin felt smooth and not dried out as soaps do to me. It's nice to know I don't have to spend a fortune anymore on body washes or gels to feel good after a shower or bath. I wish I had known about this brand before now! My skin is both dry and sensitive to some products and I had no reaction from using this plus the hibiscus and fig made the entire shower smell great.	1
I love all Ahava products and this is my favorite body wash. I have bought several bottles and also buy them as gifts which are always appreciated. You simply cannot go wrong with Ahava.	1
Smells amazing and works well	1
This is a luxurious product.  I have the hibiscus and fig scent and it is a really nice, rich, fruity scent -- but not at all artificial (like some of the body washes from chain stores).  I'm definitely interested in trying the other two fragrances now.  I also thought this did a good job of getting me clean.  I was caked in sweat from a long workout session, and it had dried a bit, but I felt refreshed after showering.  This lathered well.  It wasn't the thickest textured body wash I've ever used, but it wasn't the thinnest, either.  It was easy to apply with a mesh pouf and it rinsed off cleanly, without leaving any residue (the scent didn't linger).  You can see the full ingredients list if you zoom in on the product images.  This does not contain any dyes, which is wonderful (it does contain some added fragrance, but that did not irritate my skin).  This contains sodium hyaluronate; this ingredient will be particularly moisturizing but may not be vegan (a lot of the hyaluronate used in industry is a byproduct of poultry processing).  Overall, though, a lovely body wash.  I am sad that I have run out and I will be looking for more soon.	1
No good!	-1
While the eye cream is nice, very smooth, non irritating, and sinks into my eye area without being too oily or heavy. The dispenser leaves a lot to be desired. Such as, consistent usable. Sometimes I press the dispenser and just enough comes out, and application with the applicator wand is easy. Other times it shoots a ton that goes all over. Then there are times that it seems all jammed up. When it works it's alright, though I've stopped using the applicator wand in favor of my fingertip for applying because I can feel it going on more even in less time than trying to maneuver the skinny tip applicator. So good product, interesting design, just needs a little more work or a classic pump to get it off the ground for me.	-1
I received a sample of this and my wife was thrilled.  It won't turn a wrinkled saggy eyelid into what it was when a person was 17, but it definitely will reduce the bags and tighten it up notiveably.  My wife described it as the difference between a tired "bags under your eye day" to a "woke up refreshed day", and after I started paying attention that seemed a great way to describe it.  Doesn't have much aroma and isn't offensive.  Doesn't impact her eye makeup.  Just tightens up the area.  My wife plans on buying more to use when this one runs out, unlike all the other "one and done" products she's tried.	1
I generally have had a pretty positive experience with this eye cream. My main concern with it is the price - it is currently sitting at $42.50. For that price, I would hope it works miracles. As it is, it does a pretty good job. It took me a few tries to figure out how to best work the pump and applicator. It takes a little getting used to, but once it's going, it generally does a good job. If you accidentally pump a little too much of the cream out of the applicator part, though, it is hard to do a good job. Overall, I like this product, but at the price point, I'm not sure I can continue using it.	1
This one is a tough call. I have used prescription retinoids since I was in my late twenties. I've used Renova (back-in-the-day), Refissa (until three years ago), and Atralin (currently). Now, Atralin is recommended by my dermatologist since it is super emollient. She says that the emollient nature makes it great for eyes since their is no drag and no pull (because that area is super sensitive). Now, I am not recommending that anyone run out and get prescription retinoids and use them under one's eyes (you must work up to that). But, I am saying that when I was applying this viscous creme, I was concerned that this approach is the exact opposite my physician's (and every Allure/Vogue article I've ever read). In fact, my dermatologist said that EVEN when I apply moisturizer under my eyes, to use my pinky finger to dab it onto the skin in that area (so as to not aggressively or accidentally pull at it).  Here's the worrisome aspect of this product: the dispenser/massager is a hard piece of plastic. The "treatment" is dispensed through an eyelet (and, often part of the product is lost when one carefully depresses the applicator, but the product still travels around the unusable side. And, you cannot touch the product without contaminating it or the entire tube ... and, for products that are applied around one's eyes, the last problem you want is the results of a contaminated OTC product). AND, applying this is a little goofy. You need to rub it in for about a minute with the hard, awkward plastic piece. So, you are just jamming any contaminants into that eyelet. And, the consistency of the product is SO THICK that it just drags and pulls (exactly what my dermatologist said to avoid at all costs).  But, let's face it, you know you want to know about the results ... well, after multiple applications, it did nothing whatsoever. My skin looked like I used nothing at all. Now, it is essential that this could be the result of using stronger products under my eyes for years (but, if that's the case, maybe you should consider those, instead of this).  Like I advise everyone, if you are willing to invest in higher end products, why not just invest in a trip to your dermatologist (which is covered by insurance in most all cases). Let him/her develop a regime for you. In my case, prescription retinoids (the gold-standard of skin-care) are covered by my insurance. (If you do not have insurance, you are looking at over $200.00 a tube though). Why not use something approved by the FDA with actual clinical evidence behind it. As it stands, the claims here seem fairly specious ... and the application method, somewhat absurd (if not counterproductive).	-1
Do not discard the box in which the Vichy eye cream is packaged, but be sure to open it up to reveal detailed instructions for its use.  I have never seen an applicator like this and even better, like the actual cream.  I do not expect it to take years off of my appearance, but it helps me give my eye area attention it deserves and I have had no reaction to the formula.  I likely will replace this when it is depleted and that says a lot.	1
I've been using "Vichy LiftActive Retinol HA Eyes" for the past several days and though my fine facial lines have not disappeared (yeah, dream on), they do seem to be somewhat fainter.  I have used it on the crow's feet (actually, I don't have much of a problem with them yet), but also on some fine lines in the corners of my mouth.  Those seem to have gotten fainter.  I don't think this is a permanent thing, and would have to continue using this product or one like it to keep them at bay, but for review purposes I think it works at least a little bit.  You don't get much  - only half of one fluid oz for $42.00 (cost as of this review).  The delivery system is different but it seems to work o.k. if you don't press it down too hard.  I did that once and lost my wrinkle cream to the sink.  It goes on smoothly and seems to last for several hours as far as the moisturizing properties are concerned.  And it has little to no smell which is a very good thing.  I hate smelling perfumed lotions all day that I have applied to my face because they make me nauseous after a while.  The Vichy has no detectable scent.	1
This formula features two popular ingredients, Retinol Palmitate and Hyaluronic Acid for anti-wrinkle treatment of the sensitive eye area.  The benefits are wrinkle smoothing and filling of crow's feet.  The product is applied using the built in applicator.  I am sensitive to many eye area products but this one doesn't bother me.  It is fragrance free and allergy tested.  Vichy products feature thermal spa water from the hot springs of the town of Vichy, France, as the only water source used in the formulation.  I wanted to know if this stuff was tested on animals (I am against animal testing) - the packaging does not indicate this but I did learn Vichy is owned by L'Oreal which has not conducted testing on animals for several years.  As for how it works, I do notice a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles.  I have used more expensive products from L'Occitane with similar results so this is a good formulation at its price-point.  Based on results to date, I would order again.	1
I do like this creme Rinse.  Probably not enough to spend the $$ reordering though.	1
Super moisturizing, soaks right in, not greasy, with a delightfully fresh, (but not overwhelming), lemon scent. I've tried Avon's lemon and basil and the basil was so strong it gave me a headache. With the Korres, I don't smell much basil, not at all when first applied, but after 10 to 15 minutes have passed, a very slight whiff of it. Basil belongs in Italian food, not in a body butter! Would be perfect as lemon-scented only! This is the ONLY moisturizer that's ever helped with my cracked, dry heels, so it still rates 5 stars with me; I'd give it 10 stars if it was plain lemon.	1
Leaves my skin silky smooth. Pretty expensive for a body butter, but I feel so special when I use this. The scent is more of a coconut smell more than Guava, but it is still nice. These don't go on sale often, but I scored an amazing deal after the holidays when Sephora was trying to get rid of their "Holiday Packages".	1
love the scent of the body butter very nice	1
I have this in the "fig" scent.  First off, as a body butter, it is very good.  It is thick and very moisturizing.  (I use it at night, after a shower.  Sometimes there is a slight white residue on my legs after use, but by morning, my skin is soft and smooth.)  Here are the ingredients since they are hard to read in the product images:  Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sweet Almond Oil, Glycerin, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Sunflower Seed Oil, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Squalane, Dicaprylyl Ether, Shea Butter, Avocado Oil, Cetearyl Glucoside, Ceteareth-33, Fragrance, Butylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Potassium Sorbate, Lactic Acid, PEG-8, Alcohol, Tocopherol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Fig Fruit Extract, Grape Seed Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Citric Acid.  This is free of parabens, phthalates, and a lot of the other ingredients that are popular to avoid these days.  The only thing I don't love about this is the scent.  I guess the fig scent is not for me.  There is something very green about it (perhaps I was expecting something else since other fig-scented body products I've used in the past have been a bit sugary) that I kind of don't like.  But, I have a couple of the other scents and I will try them next.  The performance is such that I am willing to try other scents.  I'm sure there is one out there I will love.	1
Used before and like the scent however after ordering again recently after not using this product I found I can get the same moisturizing with a much less expensive product.  Probably won't splurge on Korres again.	1
this moisturizer really helps to hydrate and to moisturize skin.  the smell is authentic roses, but not to strong, just the perfect amount for a moisturizer.  the brand is all natural, which i prefer.	1
This product has a pleasant, authentic jasmine scent. It smells medium-strong upon application but after about an hour, I can barely smell it at all. It is moisturizing without being too oily and it instantly absorbed into my skin. I usually avoid butters because they can leave a sticky texture on my skin. Not so with this product. It's not quite heavy enough for use on rough elbows and heels, but that's not really an issue for me since I use BHA products on those body parts. Overall, it's a very nice light balm with an amazing scent. I'm pretty sure it's not worth $29 (I'd be happier if it was in the $15 range), but it is a nice product and would make a great gift for people who love jasmine.	1
I usually don't like Korres lotion, but this one is a keeper! I wondered what yoghurt would actually smell like in a lotion, and was pleased to discover that this scent -while not totally awesome, is certainly not offensive, or even out right terrible. Its impossible to describe, but i actually kind of like it! The scent is actually very light and fades within 10 minutes. The lotion itself has fantastic moisturizing abilities and lasts quite a while. You don't need to reapply every 15 minutes :) Even better, you don't need to use a ton of it. A little goes a long way. The consistency appears thin, but it really packs a punch! When I run out I will repurchase (that's a rarity for me, I'm pretty picky and hard to please when it comes to body and skin products).	1
The is a heavy razor but the finish of the razor is excellent. The stainless handle is finish and quality is perfect. Shave extremely close due to the fact the weight of this razor requires very little effort when shaving. The quality of the razor and design are extremely well made. One of my differently most used razor. Shave's extremely comfortable but mild. But shaves extremely well.	1
Very mild and not very aggressive. Very nice razor quality equal to razors costing much more. Very smooth and forgiving. You can easily you a much sharper blade with this razor than the one supplied with the razor. Ivwould definitely recommend this razor !	1
This is my new favorite razor.  Been using an Edwin Jagger DE89 unlined for a while and while it is an excellent razor, I prefer the 34C.  This is personal preference but here are the reasons I prefer the 34C compared to the DE89: 1) Better shaves as it is *slightly* more aggressive than the EJ 2) Better ergonomics: balance, knurling, weight and overall feel 3) Better design - I just prefer the two piece compared to the 3 piece from EJ 4) Better chrome wear.  While the EJ looks amazing out of the box, I have found the head to get buff marks which makes me think the chrome isn't applied as well as the 34C.  Could be a fluke though  You cannot go wrong with either razor, but my #1 is the 34C	1
I found this to be a very nice razor and gives a nice shave. I had a three day growth and this knocked that down with two passes and just a little touch up. The over all build is nice and is give no appearance of being a cheap razor at all. The handle is shorter then other razors I own, but I knew that going in. It does fit the hand nice and would also fit big hands nicely I believe. I will probably use this as a travel razor given its compactness and efficiency.	1
This is our second Merkur Razor, one for home and the other for the gym locker.  Excellent balance, gives a great close shave, especially when using Feather blades.	1
I have a Merkur long handle, vintage Fatboy, vintage Slim Adjustable and this is my favorite by far. Great balance, smooth, no razor burn or nicks. Just an awesome razor regardless of blade (Astra SP, Personna Blue, Feather). And the blades last longer, or seem to anyways.	1
I keep coming back to this mascara even though I'm sure the tubular technology makes it less than natural, but it is so beautiful, effective, and foolproof.	1
I was pleasantly surprised by this mascara.  I purchased it based on the recommendation of a friend and I'm glad I spent extra for BLINC.  I have had no issues with the liquid splattering out like some users mentioned.  When I asked my friend if she'd ever experienced this she said she had not either.  The way everybody describes "tubes" on your lashes did NOT match what I envisioned.  I thought this hard little tubes would literally slide off your lashes that you could hold and examine.  This is not at all the case.  To remove the mascara, you only use warm water and gently rub your lashes.  This causes the mascara tubes to get wet and soft turning it a bit like slimy feathers that just clump together and come right off in one good rub of the eyelashes.  You just dump them down the drain (I hope it's OK for my drain!), but maybe they should be dumped into the trash bin?  I don't know.  There is ZERO residue after removing the mascara.  ZERO chance of having raccoon eyes later.  It truly is amazing.  I do have to say, however, that some tiny "shreds" can still end up on your upper cheeks after a long day, especially if you're an eye rubber, like me.  It doesn't make raccoon eyes, but some flakes can still end up on your face, which took me by surprise as I didn't see any other reviewers mention that.  Pro Tip: apply one coat of mascara to entire set of lashes (you can even do lower lashes with this mascara!).  Wait 30 seconds and take a dry cotton swab (Q-tip) and rub off any mascara that you accidentally got onto your skin (I usually manage to get mascara onto my lids whenever I apply it).  No need to wet it or reapply eyeshadow after wiping off excess mascara with a Q-tip.  It wipes right off without any smudging.  Second Pro Tip: don't use eye makeup remover.  It's completely unnecessary and you'll still have to use the warm water technique afterwards anyway.  It's so easy to remove, but amazingly stays on when you don't want it to come off!  While you only get one type of lashes - your own, but slightly thicker and longer - this is good enough for me.  If you're expecting feathered lashes or whatever crazy style of eyelashes other mascara brands promise, you won't get that with BLINC.  BLINC simply takes your own lashes and makes them appear longer, thicker, darker.  No other crazy promises.  All mascara should be made this way.  I cannot recommend this mascara highly enough.	1
Best mascara I've ever found, and will never use another again. Bear in mind that this mascara does not build or extend lashes like many others will. It is a downside I am willing to sacrifice, as I have small eyes and small lids that lend to guaranteed eyeliner and mascara smudging. I used to rarely wear liner for this reason, and on the infrequent occasions I did, I would spend much of my time fixing the smudges on my lower lids. This liner is not fussy, is easy to apply and remove if one reads and follows the instructions.	1
Junk mascara in my opinion! I used 2 coats which did not even match a single coat of YSL or Tarte mascara. Took 3 rounds of using my mascara remover (which removes even waterproof in one sweep) to get this stuff off. Very clumpy when removing, leaving my lashes sticking together. In the end it cost me several lashes which did not make me happy. I definitely do not recommend nor will I buy this brand again.	-1
I was so excited to have received this mascara after reading over all the great reviews. However, my experience was anything but exciting. I have used many brands of mascara in my lifetime, but none quite like this. The first day I applied the mascara it looked like I had put nothing on my lashes. The texture of the mascara was like water. Not sure if this is normal for this mascara or not. No thickness and no lengthening to my lashes whatsoever.....I waited a few minutes to apply a second coat. Still no difference. My blonde lashes looked ever so slightly darker. That's it. My lashes were still as short and sparse as ever. That night my eyes were a bit red but it had been a long day. Didn't think much about it. I thought I would use one more day and pick up a new brand the following day. Not like I had a lot of time to be looking for a new brand of mascara. Again. Especially after I thought I had done my research. Day two: my eyes began watering and twitching. I could not wait to remove this mascara! Went to bed. The following morning both eyes were red, while my right eye was red, swollen, and visibly irritated. Absolutely NOT the result I expected :(	-1
Very good	1
My husband really likes this unit, as it works well, doesn't need batteries, and as advertised, it really doesn't ever come in contact with your skin. Highly recommended for the man who need to trim his nose and/or ear hair regularly.	1
Ouch!  Not thrilled with this nose/ear trimmer at all!  Lots of pulling and snagging of hair.  I prefer the electric models that are on the market and the price point is much higher AND you have to do all the work yourself.  Found that the contraception falls apart easily with the spring coming out.  Makes the trimming process much longer and more frustrating.  Would like for it to cut hair that is outside the ear but that's not possible with this trimmer.  I own a set of J.A, Henckels knives and was so hoping that this product would live up to the quality of those knives.  Cool design, nice and compact and love the included cleaning brush though.  That's why I even gave it the two stars!	-1
ZWILLING J.A. HENCKELS NOSE AND EAR TRIMMER  This trimmer is fast and easy to use.  All you do is keep squeezing the little handles to rotate the cutters and it does the job.  There is no exact direction such as electric trimmers.  It works 360 degrees and removes all the hair quickly.  You don't have to worry about cutting or nicking yourself as there is no direct skin contact.  A small thin brush is included to clean the trimmer when you are done.  It does seem a bit pricey for what it is, but it does get the job done.  This is a German product but it is made in Korea.  ?????  Other reviews state that the unit has fallen apart and seems to be a common problem.  Mine has not fallen apart yet; only time will tell.  Thanks.	1
These clippers are very sharp and get the hairs with the first clip  there is no painful catching or pulling.  They seem to be more effective with nose clipping than the ears but this is probably because you can stand in front of a mirror and see what you're doing.  The stainless steel material makes for easy clean up.  You can use the provided brush  or if this doesnt get all of the excised material you can swish the unit in warm soapy water and then dry with a paper towel.  The price point may seem a little high but you're getting a German engineered precision product.  To use you just place the cutting end in the nose/ear and squeeze the end together like you do with a spring clothespin.  This sets the clipper in motion and cuts the hairs.  This is a great gift to give to your favorite man.	1
This is good to have on hand for guests.  It's the kind of thing men might include in a Dopp bag.  It works very well and it's something I've known about for a long time and was glad to get.	1
So this product really looks promising on the surface but once you start using it, you quickly realize why it has so many one star reviews that have been voted most helpful over the five star reviews that now appear very questionable. First off, I have to agree whole heartedly with the reviewers who have stated that this product does more tugging of hairs than trimming. Also, when you are lucky enough to actually trim some hairs, you are barely trimming anything as it does not trim very close to the root. To top it off, the price tag here is well above what standard electric nose trimmers charge that are far more effective. For that reason, I implore you to skip this fancy looking product and opt for a more effective and inexpensive electric model. I rarely give one star reviews, but the disappointment associated with this product makes it hard to give it anything else.	-1
J.A. Heckles makes lots of sharp things, some of the best kitchen knives (although those are under the 'Henckles' name, the J.A. Henckels are the lower line).  This nose and ear hair trimmer looks pretty amazing, and comes in a nice little plastic jewel like case.  It doesn't require any power so it makes it great to throw in a bag or in your car, anyplace you might notice some unsightly hair but you don't have something powered.  It's quiet and small.  Now the not so good.  The design of the tip isn't as good as some of the newer electric trimmers, those with open ended ones instead of circular.  I find it cuts ok, but not great, some slight snagging.  Ears work pretty good, but nose seems to be pretty hit or miss.  I'll probably throw it in my car so I always have something when I need it, but still continue using a battery powered one with a better tip on it.	1
Great trimmer, as I have gotten older the nose hairs have gotten longer.  Use this, a couple of squeezes and no more unsightly hairs.  Comes with a small brush to clean it out and you can rinse it in water if a little something extra gets stuck on there.  I use it once a week now.	1
I gave this nose and ear hair trimmer to my husband and he loves it. He's not so sure it's worth the Amazon price, but overall he was very pleased with how it works. He said it's a lot like "nail trimmers"... you place the hair trimmer accordingly squeeze the ends to trim the hair. He said it gets longer hair easily, but not very short hair. He said it doesn't hurt at all (like I thought it would), and you don't even realize the trimmer is working until you look and see the hair inside as proof it did it's job. He's very pleased with the product.	1
Awesome,  wonderful,  the best mascara.  Will continue to buy AND buy the colored ones,  too.  The "tube style"  mascara is the only kind that does;t smear for me.  Love this!	1
This was a delightful buy on my part, I have absolutely no regrets.	1
Yes, it is expensive, and no, it doesn't give you huge voluminous lashes. But I wasn't looking for a mascara that would give me big lashes, I was looking for a mascara that didn't smear all over and didn't crumble into my eyes/get stuck on my contact lenses. I have tried numerous brands - Clinique, Revlon, loreal, Pacifica, Paula's Choice. All have either melted/smeared or crumbled by the end of the day. I do have really oily lids, which is part of the problem. Once Blinc dries, it stays put. It doesn't crumble. It doesn't smear. It doesn't flake off into my lenses causing me to run out of meetings so I can wash chunks of mascara out of my eyes. Sure, it isn't an amazing mascara in terms of producing volume or length, bit it does help darken and define. I won't use anything else now. The only downside is if you get any water on the mascara before it dries, it bleeds out and creates a massive mess. Make sure your lashes are super dry when you apply.	1
I don't care for this formula.... I will stick with department store brands for now. It just doesn't look that nice. Lashes look kind of 'painted' with this on.  Didn't look natural at all.	-1
The Blinc mascara does not smear like so many other mascara products.	1
Love this mascara; I've been using it for years. Even high-priced mascaras always smudged by the end of the day and were difficult to remove. The silicone "tubes" don't budge and then slide right off with warm water and regular cleanser (no need for makeup remover) The formula & brush don't add a lot of volume; it's better if you just want color and length. You do have to make sure there are no clumps before it dries, but if you get smudges on your skin during application, they peel right off with a dry q-tip.	1
It takes some getting used to in letting dry and also removal, but overall this is the best mascara you can buy.	1
good	1
This product is beautiful and stays on without smudging.  Now, I also use the Blinc Lash Primer first, so I don't know what the performance would be without using the Primer.  I'll save the primer review for that product.  What I like is that: 1.  There is no clumping. 2.  Length of lashes is increased easily by applying additional coats. 3.  Lashes really don't come off unless I use water AND rub the lashes off.  Thus, neither rubbing ONLY nor water ONLY will remove these lashes. 4.  I don't need makeup remover to remove these lashes like with waterproof mascara.  And waterproof mascara smudges when you rub--these lashes don't smudge--they come right off without pulling out my natural eyelashes. 5.  It doesn't irritate my eyes, skin, or hurt my natural eyelashes. 6.  Instructions say don't put on any moisturizer, etc., before using the product because that may make it harder for the product to stay on.  Well, I do use my eye cream first, and I wait a few minutes before applying the Primer.  So I have not had a problem with the product adhering to my lashes.  Again, this may be because I'm also using the Primer first.  Also, I use this Dark Blue color even though I'm African American, my eyes are brown, and my eyelashes "appear to be naturally black."  I read somewhere that the Dark Blue color really makes brown eyes "pop."  I was concerned about the color, but now that I have worn it, I will never purchase black mascara again.  As an African American, it was important to me that my eyelashes add something more than just length.  The Dark Blue color does appear to be Black from far away.  People notice it's Dark Blue when you're up close and especially when your eyes are wet.  Gosh, I look good wearing this color, and whoever said the color would make my eyes "pop" was right.  I have no "dislikes" for this product.  I really cannot find enough great things to say.  It's worth every penny.  And when you start wearing this product, your friends will ask you what you have on your eyes.  The next comment is typically "oh I'm going to have to steal that"--:).  So you know it looks good on!	1
This is an unusual mascara that I enjoy. It adheres to each lash and stays put until washed off. I do recommend using the lash primer to separate the lashes first, otherwise this mascara can cause them to stick together.	1
took a chance a couple of years ago and tried this mascara. it "tubes" your lashes. and i'll tell you, i really put it thru it's paces. and it passed with flying colors. only thing i've found that makes it come off prematurely is my tears. other than that, it won't smudge or flake on the hottest, most humid days. love it!	1
I love false lashes, but found them too expensive for me and felt I was losing lashes because of them. This mascara is a great second. It lasts all day with no under or over eye trace. It removes very easily with wash cloth, but will last through a hot yoga class.	1
I've learned that tastes in different mascaras are very individualized.  Everyone's lashes are different, so different mascaras work better for different people.  Blinc Mascara has a great brush that separates lashes really well.  It has long bristles.  However, the brush doesn't carry a lot of mascara for coverage.  This mascara doesn't claim to give your lashes more volume, and it doesn't.  My lashes were still thin after the application.  They did look better after a second application, but I just need one that volumizes.	1
this product did not work for me. Felt heavy and burned my eyes. I am willing to try new approaches and products but sometimes it just does not work for my sensitive eyes.	-1
Used it for several years now, love it? I will never switch back to conventional mascara that smears and smudges.	1
Maybe I got a bad tube of this stuff or something, because my experience with this product was awful. It did absolutely nothing for my eyes...it barely looked like I had any mascara on at all! Yet, when I washed my face, all the little tube things came off, but you couldn't see them when I was actually wearing the product. I do not recommend this at all.	-1
Worst mascara I've ever tried! Wow, so disappointed!! Bought it on advice from my hairdresser who has nice eye makeup after she told me it was the best ever. Ummm, in my opinion, it's the worst! For me it went on really thin and messy, Very difficult to build up any volumne at all. It feels very heavy and uncomfortable although it is only 2 coats! I also did not care for the brush which does not get the little lashes very well and makes it hard to keep it off the lids. Once it gets on the lids it is very hard to remove smudges. I would say this is a horrible but expensive excuse for mascara.	-1
I bought this mascara because I recently read a beauty book that described Blinc Kiss mascara as groundbreaking.  After giving it a week, I am tossing it out.  My eyelashes look small and thin and actually like I am wearing NO mascara when this product is applied.  Two coats you say?  After the first coat, my lashes feel hard and sticky.  Two coats can't happen.  I, too, was worried that my eyelashes were falling out when I washed my face at night, but it's just the "tubules" falling off.  Tiny tubules at that.  Also, while I have never had any problem with any beauty product in the past, and I am closer to fifty years old than any other milestone, I have irritated eyes since wearing this mascara.  My eyes feel gunky and watery, almost like there's an allergy.  Overall, I completely dislike this product.	-1
I love Blinc mascara and dark brown is my goto shade. (I've tried most of their colors) I use it along with the Blinc primer for full lashes that last all day. I wear my makeup for 14 plus hours a day and this is the only mascara that holds up. (I don't use waterproof mascara because it's too hard on your lashes) I've even put Blinc up again Sephora's deluxe mascara sampler. Which includes 10 of their most popular mascaras (Korres, Urban Decay, Smashbox, Laura Mercier..etc.) Blinc outlasts them all. There's almost no flaking and it only smears if I put my eyecream on too heavy. I solved that problem by using the heavier eyecream before bed and getting a lighter one for morning.	1
I had high hopes for this mascara, based on all the glowing reviews.  On the positive side, it absolutely comes off completely with water and a little pressure.  (However, to quibble a bit, it doesn't slide off in "tubes"--it comes off in stringy clumps, like melted plastic.)  Now on to the negatives.  I have long, thick lashes, and this mascara makes them look very thin.  It adds no volume at all, but rather makes them look spikey.  By the end of the day, my lashes are no longer smooth, but are bent at weird angles.  AND I have flakes under my eyes.  Not only that, but you can't add more mascara once it has dried.  So if you've done your makeup in the am and want to oomph up your mascara before you go out after work, you can't.  I bought a tube of this for my youngest daughter, because she likes waterproof/water resistant mascara, but always struggled with removal.  With Kiss Me she can simply get her mascara off in the shower.  But I don't think it does much as far as adding any lash drama, and she does get some flaking.  All in all, unless ease of removal is your biggest concern, I wouldn't recommend this mascara, especially at the $20+ price.	-1
I love Blinc mascara and I've tried all the colors. I have green eyes and thought this one would bring out the green. It doesn't. It's more like a dark gray so if you want a mascara that's lighter than brown then green would be great. I like the purple better then the green but if you don't want to play with the different colors just stick to dark brown or black. You can't go wrong with Blinc mascara.	1
I like that it is spf 50, I but it on my face and chest, protects my skin	1
Great sun protection that moisturizes, too!	1
Great protection for face, but pretty heavy,  Wish it could be a bit lighter.  If gets in eyes, does sting.  Still good product.	1
1st time using this particular one , it feels a little rough , not smooth as I was expecting but it definitely protect my face!!	1
I use several bio element products . I like this one when I know I'll be outdoors playing tennis but don't get near eyes if your going to sweat , it will burn. I'm 50 and have dry skin and really need the moisture and SPF so I would recommend but not if you have oily skin. I,pat it on from my forehead to my chest.	1
I've used Bioelements for years and highly recommend it for dry skin. Everybody thinks I'm 20 years younger than I am!	1
The Mustela Stelatopia range has been an absolute lifesaver for my son's eczema-prone skin. I used to have eczema myself as a child and I wish this was around back then. We have gone through bottles and bottles of the Lipid Replenishing Balm and the Bath Oil. This product, however, I've only gone through two bottles, total. I used it as a shampoo for a while, but don't really need a separate product for cleansing. It's not an absolute necessity for us but I still used it up and would recommend it if you need a cleanser for your baby. We have had absolutely no reactions to this product or the others of the range--my son's skin has only improved since Stelatopia entered the scene.	1
Really mild but effective.  Weve always liked Mustela products and have used the frequently. This has been around for years and Im glad that it is becoming more easily available in the American market.  All of their products are simply safe for babies sensitive skin and this one included.  My ten year old daughter currently uses it to wash her face, I wanted her to use a product that is not too harsh to her young skin. This is also very effective for adults with sensitive skin.  Highly recommended.	1
I'd have to say it works pretty well on eczema prone skin.. I've been using it for about 4 weeks now, the last 2 weeks I have targeted a specific area on my elbow that has broken out. I've seen a drastic improvement in the skin moisturizer wise. It has reduced the swelling and itching by about 80%. That's quite impressive, I have not had that result with other so called proven cleansers, and I've used many between myself and children. The pump allows a quantity sufficient enough to cleanse the entire adult face, neck and ears. Again I had also used it on my elbow, so I've required two pumps once daily. I have more than half a bottle left after 3 weeks of use. There's no smell, and the texture is similar to a hand soap. A little pump is plenty. Yes, I will purchase this when I run out.	1
My wife been here in US for 4 years and she had no skin problems until about three months after her arrival.  Ive taken her to several dermatologists including a private doctor who refuses insurance. The private doctor is far better than all the others put together, but my wifes skin just starts coming off of her index finger on her right hand (primarily) and nothing seems to prevent it. And we cannot understand what triggers it either.  She was only 24 years old when this started and now she is 28, almost 29.  I will include some photos to show how bad it gets  and in only two days from almost well.  We have tried all kinds of expensive prescription and over the counter eczema lotions. So even though this says it is for babies, Ill try it  anything.  She wears gloves and I do all the dishes myself. She has special hand soap and body soap, but she stopped  the soap and now only sues Mustela Cleaning Cream. Previously it kept cycling between almost well and unbelievably bad. If she grips anything hard, he skin can split open and bleed. She never had any issue whatsoever before her arrival here in the United States, of all places.  I am beginning to believe the word eczema is short for I haven't got a clue whats wrong.  Eczema seems to be a catchall term for dermatologists.  One dermatologist actually diagnosed it from 12 feet away while holding onto the doorknob to rush to the next patient (victim) in two whole minutes at most. His nurse looked at it and that was good enough for him. So disgusted to pay so much money to a thief masquerading as a doctor. Said nothing could be done. It is permanent.  Anyway, I get this Mustela Stelatopia Cleansing Cream to try on my wifes fingers.  She tried it for several days and saw some improvement after about 4 days. My wife says the aroma is not that great, but she has a remarkably sensitive nose. Seems fine to me.  She says it feels smooth in her hands when washing her hands with this Mustela Cleansing Cream. She was amazed because she has tried many Eczema lotions and cleansing products, but with zero success. She wanted to use it a few weeks before I wrote this review.  Weve seen several false starts already  seems to work well for a while or it healed naturally, then eventually just neutral, no better and no worse.  Not so with Mustela Stelatopia Cleansing Cream for Eczema. It actually does something - controlled experiment.  I know this is marketed for babies, but it doesnt matter as long as it improves my wifes skin even a little. She's a baby compared to my age.  After washing her hands with only Mustela Stelatopia Cleansing Cream for Eczema, her hands do not feel dry. It seems Mustelas lotion softens and is absorbed into her skin. Im not going to say she is cured. She isnt. But its quite an improvement, so we will take whatever I can get. It is still improving, so it's not over yet. So with that said, I can recommend this for those people who have eczema problems, not only for babies, but for adults as well. Skin is skin except for normal aging. Looking back on my own long life, I can see how I abused my skin, but I did stay out of sunlight after getting off of the farm. People routinely assume I am 15 to 20 years younger than I am. I've had to show my ID to get a senior discount on a bank account for age 55. I was a lot older. Don't frown, squint, smoke, drink and stay out of sunlight. It truly works and I'm proof. If I had not been born on a farm in Central Texas, I'd look even younger. It is cumulative.  I have uploaded the photos where her hands condition is so terrible and the very worst after using Mustela.  It never gets as bad anymore.  It still happens, as you can see in the last two photos.  We forgot to take photos of when it is average or best.  She is not in that stage right this moment, so I will upload the more typical case later. We still have to visit more dermatologists and so more research ahead to understand what triggers it.  Something clearly appears to start it.  We will take Mustela Stelatopia Cleansing Cream for Eczema with us on her next scheduled dermatologist appointment to show the doctor the ingredients.  Maybe the doctor will know a prescription strength lotion or something to aid in her recovery or maintain a better typical case.  There are many things we continue to try, but Mustela Stelatopia Cleansing Cream for Eczema is the only thing that we can specifically state improves her skin condition.  Photo Order:  First 2 photos before (really bad, but not unusual) and the last two photos after using  Mustela Stelatopia Cleansing Cream for Eczema a few weeks. It is still in an improvement stage - still early.  So I will post more photos as we go. The last two photos are the worst it gets now. It looks almost healed in-between times. We forgot to take those photos because we were imagining it would stay healed. It's a slow road, but at least I believe she is on a road to recovery now.  Before there was no path to follow.	1
Mustela Stelatopia is a thick and creamy cleanser that I find really gentle and soothing for sensitive or aggravated skin. Though formulated for babies and children with eczema, it's done wonders for my own dry, sensitive skin that gets periodic rashes and can be itchy and uncomfortable enough to wake me at night. This cleanser combined with a good moisturizer really calms the itch and irritation. Stelatopia feels like it locks in moisture and makes my skin feel ultra soft and calm all night. I've tried so many eczema products as my son had severe eczema (bright red, blistered, weepy areas on his cheeks and body) that lasted years starting when he was only 3 months old and he still has sensitive skin (but his eczema is gone), and I have my own skin issues. I think Stelatopia feels more comforting than other baby cleansers and bath washes, less drying and more effective holding in moisture.  Also, Mustela Stelatopia seems to have good quality and less irritating ingredients that pose minimal health concerns. I like to check the online EWG health concern ratings on cosmetics. The main ingredients here (coco glucoside, cetearyl alcohol, dissodium laurel, sulfosuccinate, hydroxypropyl guar, and sodium cocoyl isethionate) get favorably low EWG ratings, as do most ingredients in Stelatopia. Also, Stelatopia contains no parabens. While it isn't perfect as it does have the preservative sodium benzoate, that gets a safer rating than most parabens with a moderate EWG rating of 3, and I can't really second guess the need to prevent spoilage. I love that Stelatopia lacks fragrance (and has only a faint smell) as fragrance is an irritant that's especially bad for children. It also lacks other ingredients that may be fine for others but triggered my son's eczema, such as lanolin and colloidal oatmeal. I'm attaching a photo of the ingredients from  the newer version of the product.  I can't claim Stelatopia will get rid of eczema, in part because many factors can trigger eczema. But I definitely recommend Stelatopia as it's a good quality, non irritating formulation that's calming to my skin and seems unlikely to trigger an eczema flare up. Notably, I had to implement a number of changes beyond using a good cleanser or bath wash and moisturizer to get rid of my son's severe eczema. I wasn't using enough cortisone cream for fear of causing thin skin (which never happened), so I increased use to the prescribed amount. I eliminated dairy from my son's diet and from my own diet while nursing. I avoided all products with suspected allergens for my son (such as lanolin and colloidal oats). I also encased my son's mattress, box spring and pillows due to confirmed dust mite allergy. So one may need to do more than find a good cleanser to get rid of severe eczema. But I think using a mild, nonirritating cleanser that isn't drying plays an important role too, and Mustela Stelatopia seems excellent based on how it makes my skin feel and the use of ingredients that pose minimal health concerns. Highly recommended.	1
Really useful for cold wintery days when my newborn needed that extra boost of  moisture in his skin. I find it is also useful for the heatwave we are having now as the AC is on almost 24/7 and hence the air in the house is pretty dry at the moment (he is now 6 months old and we are still using it). The Mustela Stelatopia range has proved to be really useful for my eczema prone little one's skin- especially with the change in weather we want a product we can rely on that will not cause further irritation to his already super dry skin.	1
This is a nice thick moisturizing soap. It takes a bit of rinsing to get off completely, but is very soothing and has no perfumes or wacky smells.  Definitely not something you need to use without a specific medical or skin need, but fantastic when you have a need for it.	1
My son has sensitive,  eczema-prone skin and we have tried a variety of products for him. Some eczema products, especially the treatments have such a bad odor that we don't want to use them. The Mustela is such a nice change from sulfur smelling products. The Mustela Cleansing Cream isn't a treatment but greatly helps skin by not drying and irritating the skin in the first place. It has zero fragrance, parabens, phthalates, and phenoxy ethanols. Its super creamy and is extra gentle for my sons skin.	1
We recently tried the Mustela Stelatopia Cleansing Cream for Eczema-Prone Skin, 6.7 oz. for my toddler who was recently diagnosed with eczema and has very dry skin.  The cream went on very smoothly in the bathunlike others Ive used in the pastand washed off with out any residue. It was super easy to rinse off.  My toddlers skin felt fresh and smooth. It was soft even hours after. I would definitely recommend this product! As someone with chemical fragrance allergies, I was pleased to note that it was fragrance free as promised. Some products like&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Cetaphil-Gentle-Cleansing-Bar-Hypoallergenic-4-5-Ounce-Pack-of-6/dp/B001I45ZFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing Bar, Hypoallergenic, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>&nbsp;promise they're fragrance free but actually have a masking fragrance that can be irritating for some.	1
I got this in hopes of helping my babies face. Her little cheeks get so red and look cracked. Although this is thick and smells weird, it did help over all. There was not a huge difference but enough that I've kept using it.	1
The cleanser has an "unscented" scent.  Meaning it kind of has that medical scent to it.  It fades away very quickly and leaves no odor.  This cream is pretty soft and doesn't foam too much.  We have been using it on one of our kids who tends to get really dry skin.  We have noticed an improvement.  We have not seen any increased skin irritation with it.  We have not had the "tear" test yet, but Mustela products are usually tear free.  I just can't bring myself to "accidentally" get any in the kids' eyes for testing purposes...	1
This body cleanser is smooth rich and moisturizing perfect for my daughters exzema prone skin.  You can feel the quality and difference in Mustela products just on your first use.  As soon as you apply it to your babies skin you will feel the difference if you've used other brands.  Thet have the best scent and most effective products.	1
We've always liked Mustela products and this is no exception.  Scents are always fresh and clean, but light.  Goes on easy, no residue or greasiness.  And never had an issue with skin irritation.	1
I absolutely love Mustela products.  I have very sensitive, eczema prone skin and this stuff is seriously the best ever!  If you know what I'm talking about, you understand how unbearable an outbreak can be.  This not only soothes and cleanses my skin but it heals it.  I'm not sure what it is that makes everything calm and moisturized but I LOVE IT.  I buy other Mustela products for my granddaughter who has extremely sensitive skin and will not buy anything else. It provides the needed moisture and calm that the skin is craving.  I can't explain what it does but what I do know, is the skin calms down, it accepts the moisture and your skin thanks you.  I'm in love with this skin care line!  If you have a baby, teen, adult, it doesn't matter.  Anyone that you know that suffers with eczema or sensitive skin condition, Mustela can set you back on track.  I'm a life long fan and will never go back.  Highly Recommend!	1
Love this stuff. Have a daughter with keratosis and this stuff is wonderful! Clean smell and smooth clean feel. It is pricey but we only bathe every other night and it goes along way.	1
I love Mustela products. Their basic line is amazing, but this line for babies and children with sensitive skin is so great for little ones who need something even more gentle. We are foster parents to drug exposed babies (which means super sensitive skin prone to rashes) and our own children have suffered from eczema, this baby wash is gentle and cleans baby without irritating their skin or drying them out. We follow up with the lotion and their skin is perfect the way a baby's should be!	1
I  love Mustela for my kids and myself. During winter skin is dry and one of my kids develops eczema. Mustela products keep the flare ups under control. Smells good and skin is not stripped from protective barrier.	1
Backstory: We have a 2y10mo old and a 12 month old, both with eczema prone skin. Both have rough, red patches on their backs, arms, and elbows, and my oldest has an eczema patch on his right leg that has come and gone since birth. Since he can reach it, he scratches, and it always gets scabby and bleeds from time to time. This winter has been so hard on their skin. So much, in fact, that I rushed my youngest to the pediatrician one day because I thought he had suffered an allergic reaction to a vaccine and was covered in hives. Turns out, it was just a REALLY bad eczema flare up. Poor kiddo. Anyways, you can see that we were prime candidates to try this Stelatopia cleansing creme in this house.  Specifically designed for babies and children with eczema-prone skin, this plant-based formula is thick and spreads on almost like a lotion. I slather this all over their backs, bellies, and arms when they're in the tub and let them sit with it on their skin for a little while before rinsing clean. Unlike other Mustela products, this is completely fragrance free and hypoallergenic. It's also Paraben, Phthalate and Phenoxyethanol free, which gives me peace of mind.  After bathtime, we pat their skin dry and apply Stelatopia Emollient Balm, which goes hand in hand really nicely with the cleansing cream. I included a photo for reference. Honest to goodness, with the use of these two products, the boys' skin feels so much softer, smoother, and our use of Hydrocortisone has dramatically decreased (which I really do hate using because it bleaches their skin).  This product is so effective that it is recognized by the National Eczema Association, and has been clinically-tested on eczema-prone skin under pediatric and dermatological control. The prices of these products are exactly the same as on the Mustela website (some other Mustela products were more expensive on Amazon for some reason). I couldn't find this Stelatopia line at Walmart or Giant Eagle anywhere, so I also love that there is an Amazon Dash button available to make sure that our supply doesn't run out since I can't run to the local store to pick up more.  This absolutely has made a difference in our household, and I am a true believer in this product.	1
My son has extremely sensitive skin that is on the drier side - he is allergic to most products with any fragrance. It is very hard finding a quality product that doesn't give him any reaction or hives. This Mustela Stelatopia cleansing cream is great. It has worked great for him. It literally has 0 fragrance and it doesn't smell like anything. It is creamy and it foams up and cleanses regardless of having no fragrance. No parabens. No phthalate. No Phenoxethanal. It is hypoallergenic as well. This pump bottle comes with 6.76 ounces of cleansing cream- it even works great for those sensitive little faces- and sensitive enough for babies right out of the NICU. It is recommended to wash up in a lather, rinse and towel dry without rubbing to hard (aka getting product off of skin). INGREDIENTS : AQUA/WATER/EAU, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, DISODIUM LAURYL SULFOSUCCINATE, HYDROXYPROPYL GUAR, SODIUM COCOYL ISETHIONATE, ZEA MAYS (CORN) STARCH, CITRIC ACID, GLYCINE, GLYCERIN, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, SODIUM BENZOATE, POLYQUATERNIUM-10, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL UNSAPONIFIABLES, TITANIUM DIOXIDE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PERSEA GRATISSIMA (AVOCADO) FRUIT EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXIDE.	1
This fragrance free cleaning cream is excellent for sensitive, eczema prone skin of any age. My skin is very easily irritated adn I love this product; not only is it calming for eczema but also soothing for very dry skin. I feel clean but not stripped. Unlike just about anything else, I feel it does not agitate or irritate whatever skin issues I have going into the shower.  If you have dry hyper-sensitive skin, this is worth a try. Definitely give this a chance if you are seeking fragrance free products. I also recommend Mustela's other Stelatopia products as amazing skin savers.	1
This did not work well on my fine shiny hair (not a lot of texture).  I turned the heat setting all the way up, but it didn't seem to get hot enough.  It also caught and pulled hair out during the curling process.  I'm going to try the hot tools 1181 and see if it's any better.	-1
The product is very easy to use.  It is lightweight and heats quickly so that you can use it whenever needed.	1
I did a ton of research before selecting this Hot Tools curling iron. I considered purchasing this same item at Ulta, but after finding it here on Amazon it was a no-brainer.  I have curling wands which I prefer to use and work well, but I wanted a larger barrel curling iron WITH a clamp to quickly and easily do my front bangs with. This works perfectly for that. I even find that I reach for this to do my regular curls, whereas I'd normally switch to a curling wand.  I like this curling iron because my hair doesn't get stuck on the barrel, and the clamp is easy to use and doesn't seem to stick. I did a lot of testing at Ulta and compared how different barrels and clamps worked on my hair-type, and this one was a winner for me!  I haven't (yet!) had any problems with the black enamel flaking off, but I don't use it everyday. I use it maybe 2 or 3 times per week, and it seems to be fine for me.	1
Is a good curling iron, but still can't use at maximum heat without my hair smelling fried (I cannot stand that smell!). I like the non digital temp adjustment, and swivel is nice for operating. Was concerned about the "slickness" of barrel, but it still seems to hold hair without a line in the curls. Not bad for the money.	1
This is a great item. my hair holds curls for the entire day. Curling iron does not seem to damage my hairs	1
This mask is amazingly nourishing and smells so lovely.	1
This is great hair product!	1
This masque makes it possible for me to have healthy platinum blonde hair. Without this once a week my hair would be straw. 10 stars if I could!!	1
This works well under makeup. Its slightly greasy, but once foundation and setting powder are layered, it looks nice. I like that its water resistant up to 80 minutes and it doesnt sting if it gets into my eyes. Its a very thin lotion, and does have a slight grassy smell, which I don't love, but other than that, I am happy with it.	1
First tried it at a hair salon!  DIY is a cheaper version!  It is the best conditioner I have tried.  Really leaves my tangles hair soft and smooth, so much easier to handle once it is dried.  Retains its softness even when you apply heat to your hair is drying or straightening tongs!  Expensive though.	1
After I used the oil I expected this to work wonders but it made my hair crazy frizzy and I felt I wasted my money.	-1
Derm gave me several samples of this and I love it. I hate sunscreen but this one makes it less of a chore to wear since it's very lightweight, does not leave a white cast, is not oily, or greasy.	1
This is my favorite hair mask at the moment. My hair stylist had introduced me to Moroccan Oil (the actual hair oil) and so I decided to also give the mask a try and I really like it.  First of, it smells wonderfully and I could almost use it just for that. But more importantly, it seems to be just right for my hair which is short and  highlighted and dry. It definitely needs moisture but is also easily over-cared for, and then usually has no body and needs to be washed too frequently. The Moroccanoil Intense Hydrating Mask solves these seemingly contradictory problems. It nourishes my hair and gives it much needed moisture, but on the other hand has none of the negative effects other masks and conditioners tend to have which eventually weigh down my hair. I have been using the mask once a week, sometimes even twice a week and am still extremely happy with the results.  I definitely recommend this product although it really is pricey. Thankfully it lasts for quite a while as one doesn't need much per application...	1
I have extremely dry (due to thyroid condition), frizz-prone, super-curly hair. I use intensive conditioners, always. My local beauty shop owner recommended this a few months ago, and I was put off by the price. A couple weeks ago, though, I smelled it, was enraptured by the scent (think of a seductive harem or sacred anointing oil, cause it has that frankincensey-myrrhy sort of smell that reminds me of both, funnily enough). I bought it. I tried it. I'm sold! It's not just hype. This mask really hydrates my superdry hair and leaves it silky, manageable, supersoft, and easier to style.  And, oh, the scent. I'm gonna get the shampoo and regular conditioner. Today I bought the oil, but I haven't used it yet.  Good stuff, and the price in my local area beauty stores for this very large jar (2 cups + worth of mask creme) is fifty bucks. So, online can give one a price break.	1

Great sun protection. I use this on my toddler as an all over spf due to her sensitive skin. Works great with no issues. Will buy more.	1
I tried this twice. Followed directions. Shake. Apply liberally. Etc. So not sure why it didn't work for me.	-1
Excellent I recommend shipping on time, exceeded my expectations !!! very good.	1
This stuff is great.  I use it under my daily face lotion every day.  It's very light and does not make my skin feel greasy.  I have recommended it to friends who also like it.	1
The price here is better than WALGREENS. This sunscreen is amazing !	1
Recommended by my dermatologist.  Like that it is not thick.  You do have to shake to combine ingredients.  Takes very little for my face and neck. Like all sunscreens, keep away from your eyes.	1
Love this sunscreen! I use this on my face and d&eacute;colletage  I have very sensitive skin and all other products have produced an allergic reaction. I can go to the pool now without worrying about a sunburn.	1
I love the way this absorbs so thoroughly yet protects so superbly.	1
Excelente product! It leaves your skin oil free... Love la Roche products! The best!	1
My favorite sunscreen hands down.  It's light, non-greasy, and can be used under foundation. I could also use it for days I don't wear make up and not have streaks.  Love it.	1
It works but not as well as it's predecessor - Fluide Extreme.  Fluide Extreme was so good it actually kept my sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin clear.  This stuff is just sunblock and, at this price point, not really worth it.  And it leaves a rather odd powdery finish on your skin.  Somewhat drying as well.	-1
They were selling this for over thirty dollar and I could not believe the selling price since after reading the ingredients with no ZO in the mix, I checked to see the reviews on Amazon which were more misleading. They sell less chemicals in 16oz for much less money, much much less money.  Active Ingredients: Avobenzone (3%, Sunscreen), Homosalate (15%, Sunscreen), Octisalate (5%, Sunscreen), Octocrylene (5%, Sunscreen), Oxybenzone (6%, Sunscreen)  Inactive Ingredients: Water, Styrene Acrylates Copolymer, Silica, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Alcohol Denatured, Poly C10 30 Alkyl Acrylate, Diethylhexyl Syringylidenemalonate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Caprylyl Methicone, Trisiloxane, Acrylates/Dimethicone Copolymer, PEG 100 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Dimethicone, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Caprylyl Glycol, Methylparaben, Acrylates (C10 30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer), Chlorphenesin, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Triethanolamine, Ethylparaben, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexl Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Cassia Alata (Candle Tree) Leaf Extract, Maltodextrin.  These are pure chemicals that dry out the skin from alcohol to Methylparaben, Triethanolamine to active ingredients of Oxybenzone, which are top contenders on the list of EWG's overall hazard list. I make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix with fewer ingredients. ZO is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection. A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful of 90% plus certified organic ingredients and FREE OF; fragrances, perfumes, additives, softeners, thickening agents, gums, alcohol, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane. BABO has 22% ZO with conventional not organic ingredients which is a higher amount of ZO than an organic brand like BADGER with 18.5% ZO. But ZO is not the only ingredient in BABO so there are few issues with BABO formula. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer the possibility of sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with skin exposure to the sun.	-1
Perfect for my husband who does not like the feel of sunscreen I would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others.	1
I have tried many sunscreens and found them all too heavy and white looking.  This one goes on clear and is very light.  I assume it protects well, too.  My Dermatologist recommended it to me.	1
This product absolutely works. In college I was always sporting a tan. As I wised up, I haven't tanned in about a decade. So I am very fair. I travel quite often to the Caribbean. With this product, absolutely no burning at all.  It's very liquidy so a little goes a very long way. It's great for the face (I use on face, neck, chest and hands - I use a spray for the rest of my body when needed) as it absorbs very quickly and doesn't conflict with cosmetics. No "white" to rub in. The skin will just soak it right up. My esthetician said it's great for oily skin. I have dry skin so I combine with a moisturizer.  Love this product. And right now it's marked down on Amazon, so super great!!	1
I purchased this long before it came out on in longs drugs and I love how thin it is. It ABSORBS QUICK INTO THE SKIN	1
Best lotion. Use sparingly,  but it's an interesting and awesome product.  Easy does it.	1
I love this lotion.  I started using it twice a day for my KP on legs and back of arms.  After just one week, I could feel my skin super soft and bumps gone.  Now I use it once a day.  I will continue to buy.	1
Very thick, but gets rid of the KP on my legs and back of arms.  You have to use it everyday.	1
Helps sun damage.remember pf50 while using this.very effective.use ever other day or u may itch.	1
This is amazing--saw improvement in skin in only a few days.	1
Excellent lotion for resurfacing skin on body. Does feel heavy at first but sinks in quickly and stings a little at first because of the glycolic acid. Has done a good job getting rid of discorlation, age spots and sun damage on my arms. I use it at night and wear a sunscreen during the day to keep skin looking good. Also can be bought with sunscreen in it if you prefer. Will continue to purchase.	1
I love this lotion! Soft skin, it does help to exfoliate and even out skin but that takes time whereas the softness came pretty quickly within a few uses!	1
It is useful as it described.	1
Have ordered 3 of these, love the product for clearing up troubled skin!  Fast ship.	1
If you have KP/Chicken bumps/Rough skin, you better get on the glytone band wagon. There is NO ONE that will or can ever say anything bad to me about Glytone, especially this lotion. This is what introduced me to the power and benefits of glycolic acid. My arms used to be so rough and I used to get so embarrassed when people stroked it. Kiss that all goodbye. This lotion got rid of ALL of the KP. All!!! Not some, but ALL!  The KP on my legs is proving more stubborn but it has definitely come a long way from what it used to be. I would recommend and over recommend. In fact, Glytone should make me a Brand Ambassador! ;)  It may sting after some time. When that happens, what I do is to 1. Either lay off the product for a bit or 2. Mix with a nice oil of my choice (shea butter, coconut). This seems to dilute the product and make it more tolerable.  If you have any questions, I would be glad to answer if I can xx	1
Nice product line if you have redness as I do from a facial gone bad.	1
This is a great product	1
Absolutely love this stuff. Ordered after seeing Lisa Eldridge use it on a client in one of her videos. Travel friendly-packaging, SPF, a slight green tint to help redness and it's just the right texture. Feels creamy without being too heavy (although I do wait a few minutes to let it absorb before doing my makeup).	1
I use Glytone products for my face, and decided to start using this product on my arms and decolletage to help minimize the age spots or moles or whatever, that have developed over the years.  This has a lovely texture and soaks in nicely while keeping me moisturized all day.  I can't say it's really doing anything about the spots, but it feels good and has sunscreen!	1
This is a great product for redness from Rosacea, it hides the red and the SPF is good for the occasional sun here in PA!  Not a lot of smell and the coverage makes the skin look more even.	1
Product works well but is a little sticky and you really have to rub it in. A little goes a long way.	1
I was skeptical of the "tissue off" cleanser. It doesn't leave any residue, however, and it does take off my make up and clean my pores. I'm pretty happy with it.	1
Absolutely works for those little bumps I get on my upper arms. You have to use it daily for about a week before you start to notice. If you use too much or if you get it on tender parts of your arm, it will burn and irritate, so you have to be careful. You only need to use a small amount each time. If you stop using, the bumps will eventually come back.	1
This product is amazing. Love love love it.	1
This is a calming cream.  I always keep some on hand as it really works.  It smells good and is very creamy. The product was well packaged and arrived on time.	1
Love this stuff. Use it with the body wash a couple of times a week. Will sting - especially if broken skin. The burn/tingle subsides in a few minutes.	1
This does not sensitize my rosacea prone skin. It does feel like washing your face with conditioner. I almost wonder if it's cleansing my face at all, but I appreciate that it doesn't irritate!	1
good	1
Not amazing give me rash ,,,,, too strong for my skin . Do not use if you have sensitive skin or on shaved legs !	-1
lone it.thank you	1
This stuff is EFFECTIVE! I just love it. I use it once or twice a week. It makes my skin feel super smooth and silky on a deeper level.  Careful - if you have so much as a tiny cut - it WILL sting. In fact, I can not shave within 24 hours of using the stuff. But it's worth it - believe me!	1
This is a nice cleanser for sensitive skin. It removes make up well and leaves the skin soft.	1
Don't expect any kind of miracle from this stuff - my KP has not gone away, but it has become noticeable less bumpy. I still have little red dots on my upper arms, but they're not bumps, so that's a definite improvement in my book!	1
This stuff is thick, has a good SPF and really keeps the body moisturized for hours. I'll buy it again.	1
I have extremely sensitive and fair skin. I also have rosacea. This is one of the few cleansers that has cleared up my skin and not irritated it at all. Although you are supposed to wipe off with a tissue, I use water. It removes all my make-up and is really gentle.	1
I noticed an immediate difference in my skin after 1 use.  My skin felt reborn, not tight, not oily, no breakouts.  The more I use it the better my skin gets.  I've tried other products for sensitive skin, none of them worked. Not, dove, not cera vue, not cetaphil, nothing is as great as Avene. I will definitely order again.  I just love Avene extremely gentle cleaner lotion, along with the thermal water, skin recovery, and triacneal.. Not he gentle cleanser is also effective at removing all of my makeup including my 3 coats of mascara.  Avenue is the best stuff on earth.  I just love it	1
My keratinosis pilaris was pretty bad when I found this product. While I am still working on getting rid of it it has greatly diminished in severity. I will say that this product, particularly the lotion, does burn sometimes. Also I wear gloves when applying the lotion so that it doesn't eat up my cuticle and nails. I would recommend this product if nothing else seems to be working.	1
great	1
Great product!	1
I have been using this for awhile. It has smoothed out tne backs of my arms, BUT, It is strong and you have to build up to this glycolic strength.	1
Glytone advises that this not be used on the face, and in fact, I wouldn't use it anywhere but my feet, because the acid concentration is so strong.  But it is wonderful.  Daily I sit tailor-fashion on a leather chair with bare feet, so the side of my right foot is constantly dry, flaky, and coarse.  After bathing, I apply the Glytone cream, and by morning, that patch is soft again.  It did take about four days of evening application to get it back to 100% normal, but four days, that's really something.  I love this stuff and have recommended it to friends with chronic foot dryness.	1
This lip balm started my love of all Avene skin products. It is the best lip balm I have used. It is made in France, and we know the French are leaders in skin care. It is made with Avene Spring Water, Avene Cold Cream Formula and Vitamins E and F. The lip balm feels fresh on my lips and provides a creaminess that is not greasy and is lasting. I like the shape of the lip balm, and it does fit right in my purse.  This was a gift from a dear friend, and I am not sure if I would have purchased it for myself. It is double what I usually pay for lip balm, but after using it, I may need to re-think.  I am a fan of lipstick, and I put this lip balm on and wait a few minutes, then apply my lipstick. In the past my lipstick has become a greasy mix on my lips, but with this lip balm the lip stick slides right on. I apply some before bed and my lips are smooth and moist in the morning. This is the best lip balm I have used.  Recommended. prisrob 01-13-15	1
This over price lip balm went on heavy and waxy.  It did not penetrate my lips with moisture.  It just sat on my lips like candle wax.  The only good thing is it does not have a taste to it.  I love all of the avene skin care line it have given me back my youth but this lip balm is terrible.	-1
This is the best eye cream.  It may seem a little pricey for such a tiny tube, but it lasts FOREVER.  I'm notorious for using more product than is strictly necessary, and even I only use a dollop slightly smaller than a pencil lead for each eye.  It keeps the area around my eyes moisturized and smooth, and makeup goes over the cream and stays put quite nicely.  Finally, I have very sensitive skin and eyes, and this is one of the only creams I've ever used that doesn't irritate either!	1
This is a very gentle cleanser. It smells good.  My face feels soft  after using this product.  It is expensive but for irritated skin it is a must have.  This line also have an amazing calming cream that works well with the cleanser. Yes, I would buy again.  The product was well packaged and arrived on time.	1
It still dries your skin out. It says to remove with tissue and not to scrub. If you don't scrub you can't remove it. When you scrub it shreds the tissue and leaves the tissue in balls all over your face. It feels totally gunky.	-1
good	1
Definitely a small tube but you don't need much... It lasted me at least 2 months, used it daily.  Very soft and gentle for sensitive skin around eyes.	1
great	1
I love this amazing cream!  Last peel my face got irritated and I used this calming cream.  It worked right away and felt really good on my skin. I will buy this product again.  I always keep it on hand.  Actually this is a really good line of products and I use several others creams from this line. The price is fair.  The product was well packaged and arrived quickly.	1
Very moisturizing, not irritating, but very greasy. I cannot use this on my face as it just makes me feel oily for hours. I have dry skin, which is usually never greasy (I often have to moisturize twice!), but this made me feel greasy for hours	-1
Great stuff.	1
I bought this at a pharmacy in Paris, when I had miserably chapped lips.  It instantly started making my lips feel better, and they were fully healed up in a couple of days.  I love love love this lip balm and have come back to order more.  It works so well!	1
GOOD PRODUCT	1
Lovely cream.  Great for dry or distressed skin.	1
Nothing works better on rough heals. Put a small amount it on heals, cover with socks, wear overnight. If you do for a few nights in a row, heals will be soft. You have to be careful not to get it on tender parts of foot. It will irritate and burn any area the does not have calluses. I've never used it on elbows so can't speak to that.	1
This is a cream that hydrates and causes no irritation. avene simply doesn't make a bad product! if you a in doubt please try this, IT WORKS!!	1
I have used this wonderful Avene eye cream for the last four or five years at least, and by use I mean I don't buy any other and only use this one which is radical considering that this is the second eye cream that I have ever bought ( and Im 32) that really works for me. My eyes used to be VERY dry and the flesh very picky and needy of moisture, its exhausting putting on five layers of eye cream, with this one I can do with one or two but it doesnt turn my face into a slick mess. My first find that worked was the Burts Bees royal jelly cream which brought relief and started to finally satisfy my skin but its thick, thick lovely goo in comparison to this. Over time my skin has calmed down, now its balanced between mixed dry and oily parts that have normalized after using good products with healing thermal water. Avene and Vichy are two brands that I have also used when I lived back in Europe and Im still amazed and impressed that they really are great, regardless of where I live. Natural rich mineral water from the soul of this planet combined with great cosmetics does one wonders.  Not to sound like a spokes person for Avene but my medicine cabinet is full of it with many fun samples as well, mostly thanks to my mom who always supplies me with it as well ( shes obsessed with it). This is a wonderful brand, you don't even have to have bad, dry, sensitive skin, this will work for anyone making your skin feel smooth, comfortable and supple, it won't take twenty years off but it will make you look and feel your best. Its soothing, healing and since I wear makeup its just perfect for smooth, nice application. I love the moisturizing qualities of this eye cream, it makes my skin feel so good that I don't even have to think about it, now thats relief :)  - Kasia S.	1
This jar of strong glycolic cream is the real deal! I have a totally unscientific and brute force way to test potency of glycolic (or vitamin c) products: put a dab on a fresh shaven inner thigh. If it burns, it definitely has potency. This cream burned, OUCH!  (I washed it off that area immediately).  As for usage, the instructions are on the box, so keep it! (They are so short, they really should be on the jar). You are to leave it on feet or elbows 10-15 minutes, then rinse off. However, I use the instructions on dermatologist Cynthia Bailey's web site: use pumice stone after showering, apply cream, and wear socks for eight hours. Here's a little time and hand saver: wash hands, after applying cream (you must) and pumice stone at the same time. Two washings in one. And the pumice stone is much more easily cleaned sooner than later after use.  The result? Noticeable softening of rough skin on feet! Expect an improvement as early as after the first use and even more after 3-5 uses. I am using it every other day for a week, then a week off, then back to every other day, etc. Not exactly, but something like that.  I usually am skeptical about products such as this from somewhere other than a dermatologists' office or authorized brand dealer, but in this case, I'm pretty sure it's the real thing. Also it has an expiration date (some products don't) and the day was way out, not  anytime soon.  I hate pedicures! (except the massage part, I would pay for that if I could get it "a la carte.") This cream, and Dr Hauschuka's nail neem oil, are two products that can help keep you away from the cuticle cutting chair--and, at the same time, reduce your risk of toenail fungus that you may get from a pedicure.	1
GREAT stuff.	1
Good stuff, though expensive. The directions say to rinse it off in 15 minutes or so. But, I don't see why. It melts into your heels, so no reason to rinse it off. To each his own, though. There's no scent, so that's great. It's pricey, so I use it once a week and other regular lotions in between.	1
This product actually does what it says it would. My heels were actually extremely soft and I found myself going for a pedicure less often! Amazing! The only downer is that it is quite small for the price. Just as soon as you start enjoying it, poof, it's finished. Hence why it did not get 5 stars	1
This is the cream I use every night and every morning. Works well for intolerant skin!	1
I bought this when i had a rash on my face and everything aggravated it. This did not and in fact, calmed it down. I don't know what ingredient did it, but I'll def buy again.	1
This is a great cream to use for dry skin, I use the retrinal .1 and this along with it for quite some time. DEFINATELY recommend to anyone who has super sensitive skin, or any skin type other than oily !!	1
if you have dry sullen skin this is the one you need. no reaction and I have very sensitive skin. this with the .1 retinal from Avene has lifted, erased lines and given brightness as well as knocked a decade off my face!!	1
This stuff really works, I love to use it a day before I go in for a pedicure and it really makes the pedi. Even better. Wash your hands after you apply this stuff would not want any of this to get in your eyes by accident.	1
Love Glytone products. Very effective. This has a nice clean smell and does a great job exfoliating. You do have to use a decent amount to work up enough lather if you're using it in your whole body, so the bottle likely won't last more than 6 weeks with daily, full-body use.	1
This was recommended to me by my dermatologist and has since become my go-to body wash.  Sure there's no fun, fancy scent since it's more of a medical-grade product.  But the results are fantastic.  It helps keep my skin smooth and body acne free, but also is gentle enough that it doesn't exacerbate my dry skin.	1
I have KP and this has helped with getting it reduced. Also helps with body acne.	1
lone it.thank you	1
I love this thermal spring water. This is really the first time that I have used this type of a product. But it really does do everything it says it does. It will help remove your makeup and hydrate your skin. It will help with sun burns and rashes. I use this on my clients who have dry, normal, or combination skin. I will NOT use this on someone who is oily, and I will only use this on combination skin on the areas that are dehydrated. I use this for myself as well, of course. My son also broke out in a rash from something and this really helped hydrate his skin and take some of the itchy pain away (poor guy).  I can't believe it took me this long to try this. Plus the bottle is huge and it will last forever. I don't think I can live without this!	1
This moisturizer is nice for the days my skin needs just a little more moisture. It leaves my skin soft and supple and provides some spf which is an added bonus.	1
Leaves only the soft feel	1
I love this! I am going through a bout of severe bacne and adult acne.  I switched my soaps to Dove Sensitive Skin and use this body wash 3 times a week. It does not dry out my skin or add to the acne I am getting. My shoulders and chest look SUPER glowy and shiny after I use it. It smells nice too.  Now I cannot say if it has actually reduced my body acne but it's certainly gentle enough that it has not added to it.	1
I am new to this line of skincare and am absolutely hooked!  Every product I've purchased is gentle and seemingly effective--with a great price!  I've begun to switch to this line as my other products run out.  I'm a very happy customer.  This product is wonderful for my sometimes-dry skin.	1
Great moisturizer and sunscreen. Feel pleasant on skin, not greasy, will buy it AGAIN !!!	1
I have very sensitive skin, and have recently been suffering from a case of folliculitis.  I found a dermatologist's blog that recommended this scrub and a zinc soap, and they have been working really well so far to help clear up my trouble spots.  This Glytone wash also works great to help smooth out the bumps you get on the back of your arms (keratosis pilaris).   I use it on a Salux towel, and gently scrub my body with it after I've done a regular washing.  After following this protocol for a few weeks, my skin is getting noticeably softer and smoother, and my lumps and bumps are disappearing.  It's great stuff!	1
One of the best moisturizers for my fragile skin; and I really appreciate the SPF! For daily use, it's perfect! The price on Amazon is the best price found.	1
I had hoped based on the reviews it would clear up some body acne from workouts and hormones. It did seen to help initially but no long term solution or cure. For the price I really expecte it to be. Bummer. . It does smell nice though.	-1
works great	1
I use this daily before applying my facial moisturizer - it makes the moisturizer go on smoothly and you can use less.	1
Very nice but the tube is too small	1
I have used 2 bottles and have to say it does help with KP and evening out of one's skin. The only downside is that it's quite small for the price and you need quite a lot to lather up and work into those targeted areas.	1
Such terrific stuff. I have everything they make - and love it all.	1
good	1
I am new to this line of skincare and am absolutely hooked!  Every product I've purchased is gentle and seemingly effective--with a great price!  I've begun to switch to this line as my other products run out.  I'm a very happy customer.  This product is wonderful for my sometimes-dry skin.	1
This bottle is huge! It'll last forever! It's a simple thermal spray, and I love how fine the spray is.	1
This was recommended by my esthetician for my easily-flushed skin (face and neck). I use this larger can as part of my daily facial care, and travel with the smaller can. It works beautifully to cool my skin, and to compliment my skin care applications and makeup application. Love Avene!	1
Soothing~	1
good	1
love this	1
Because our Spring felt like Summer, and now that Summer has arrived, I find that just a spritz of the Avene Thermal Spring Water provides a nice boost of freshness.  I think I'll carry the travel size in my purse for these brutal over-the-top sweltering days and nights when I'm out and about!  Gotta love it!	1
Wouldn't be without it! I use it to set my mineral powder makeup and alone for refreshing moisture.	1
So I purchased this because my other thermal water can wasn't working anymore (it was from a different brand). Anyway it's a huge bottle 10 ounces I believe. The nozzle is perfect, one spray usually covers my entire face, so the bottle will last for a while.	1
Don't let anyone tell you it is just water. This is different. I received a small sample bottle in my monthly Allure Beauty Box and I loved it. The thing that really sold me was that after I used it a few times a day my skin was soothed and so much clearer! It relieved me of clogged pores and my skin is perfect. I had heard that the chemicals and deposits from hard water can irritate skin and I am a believer now...I mean I would never have believed it had I not experienced the difference with my own eyes. For the record, Evian and other sprays are not Avene, this is truly a special product!  ***UPDATE*** *Why anyone feels this review was unhelpful perplexes me. I would think a testament to it's ability to sooth and calm skin to the point of clearing up clogged pores in some individuals would be a useful bit of information. Obviously, if you have no sensitivities it would not be a point of concern, but it is still pertinent to the uses of this product and to be honest I didn't realize I had sensitivities to the hard water where I live until I began using Avene. Personally, I use a daily AHA/BHA product as the last step of my night time skin regimen and rather than use tap water to neutralize it, I spray my face with Avene and pat dry...there has been a big improvement in the clarity and overall appearance of my skin. Another added bonus I've found is that when I use this on areas where I'm prone to Psoriasis before using moisturizers or medicated creams it seems to somehow increase the efficiency of the other products and amount of time in which the affected areas clear up.  Lastly, Avene is very refreshing (as any water spritz probably would be, but this doesn't have calcium or other irritants possibly found in tap water and has additional soothing properties not found in distilled water) and it is great for de-mattifying makeup after setting it with powder if you prefer a more natural finish.	1
good	1
Definitely will buy it again. Necessary for daily and night skincare routine.	1
This is really a nice treat for days when your skin feels really dry.	1
This is a nice spray for misting to wipe your face etc. especially for size and price compared to other brands. If you are extremely sensitive skinned I do not recommend this.	1
Great item	1
Just apply as base coat. Polish nails. When ready to take points l u should off, I just peel it off. Does not damage my nails!!	1
I don't know how it does what it does but; it does it like nobody else can.  The AVENE thermal spring water is the fountain of youth.  My combination oily skin is now soft and supple. I use the thermal spray twice a day and it's amazing!  I've only been using the thermal spring water for two days and I got dramatic results in conjunction with my other Avene products. Such as my skin recovery and triacneal for my t zone.  I most definitely will order more.	1
Love this	1
I used Evian water face spritzer in the past and did not notice any beneficial effects from it. Avene Thermal Spring Water Spray works so much better. I've noticed how my face feels soft only just a few minutes after spraying. This product helps me manage my skin's ultra-sensitivity and allergies. I also spray it on my body after a shower and don't need to use a lot of lotion or moisturizer. Next time, I'll buy the smaller can(s) since this big one is harder to use...it keeps slipping out of my hand.	1
LOVE this product!  It makes it so much easier to get glittery/sparkly nail polish off without destroying your nails. I will always have to keep this in stock!	1
I love this product. It's gentle and soothing after chemical peels and other facial procedures. .I'd recommend it to anyone going through a post procedure process. The delivery service was remarkable.	1
The Avene Thermal Spring water spray has been a livesaver.  Its the first thing I put on my face after the shower and gives my skin a tad bit of moisture.	1
This does what is says it will do for the most part. I applied it and noticed when I started putting polish over it that it wasn't fully dry yet - not sure how long you have to wait but it's longer than most base coats. It almost has a more glue like texture. So just wait a lot longer than you expect. I think since I applied too soon, some bits of the base coat didn't stay put so there were a few spots where peeling it off was harder but I bet if I gave it more time, it would work perfectly. Also, if you are a bit rough on your nails (washing dishes, swimming, anything with your hands really), the polish might start to peel off on its own! That's generally not a big deal since I'm usually over glitter polish after a few days but just a warning on that one. Mine did start to come off of a few of my nails before I was ready to remove it.	1
This light and fresh water spray is so wonderful.  Take it to the beach!  I put it in the refrigerator the night before and it is so cold for the beach the next day!  It feels really good!  This is a really nice big can of water spray!!  The product was well packaged and arrived on time.	1
I think this product marks the first time I have ever purchased something after seeing it in a magazine ad.  But I happened upon the ad a day or two after spending 20 minutes trying to remove glitter polish from my fingers and toes.  (The acetone I'd been scrubbing with stripped all the oils from my fingers, too, and made my hands really dry.)  I love glitter polish, but what a pain!  So I had to try this.  This was very easy to apply.  It goes on fairly smoothly and evenly.  It's white when you put it on but it dries (mostly) clear.  I used two coats to make sure I got even coverage.  Then I put on some glitter polish (I've now used this with two different Zoya glitter polishes).  The polish went on perfectly.  I did notice this shrinks a bit more than other base coats, so you would want to try to get some on the edges of your nails and over to the other side if you can (my nails were too short to do that, unfortunately).  Chipping/length of wear were the same as with other base coats and with no base coat.  I touched up in a few places.  And then it came time to take this off.  And I was amazed.  For most of my nails, the polish came off in a single sheet.  All I had to do was start peeling at a corner (I usually chose the cuticle end).  On a few nails, there were more pieces.  When I was done, I barely had to use one cotton ball with acetone to clean up, and that was mostly on the edges where I'd done touch-ups.  It was so fast and easy!  It didn't do any damage to my nails, either.  So anyway, this stuff is great.  It smells suspiciously like Elmer's glue, and it very well might be something quite similar.  But I love that it comes in a bottle with a brush like any other base coat.  This is one nail product I may finish off completely!  One note, though: don't soak your hands in warm water or your nailpolish will slide right off.  This must be water soluble.  It was fine through regular-length showers but when I tried to take a bath, I lost my manicure!	1
I am thanking the nail polish Gods for this product.  I LOVE IT.  I change my manicure every 2-3 days, so I always hesitated to use glitter polishes, or my Zoya Pixie Dust collection, because it was so difficult to remove.  The Glitter Off allows me to remove my polish easily and without nail damage.  I've tried the DIY Peel-able base coats, but found they didn't hold and the polish would fall off my nail while at work, outside, etc.  I haven't experienced that with this product.  I'm now making good use of my glitter polishes.	1
It actually works somehow!  We tested it by peeling an orange by hand, and even rubbing our hands in the Orange peels before washing. We did a before and after "sniff" test.  To use it, pretend it is a bar of soap, and rub it between your hands and fingers for 30-40 seconds under running water. After 30 seconds, we could still smell some orange, but we ran it for another ten seconds, and the odor was gone!  Only the slightest hint of orange lingered on our hands. The stainless steel "soap bar" smelled the way it did when it was first taken out of the box.  I am not sure how this works, but it does. There was no residue or any indication that the "bar" had been treated with anything, or that it released any liquid, etc.  It appears to just be a blob of stainless steel shaped to look like a bar of soap, but it works at taking away odors from hands!	1
It's crazy how well this works.  I used to have a stainless steel sink, and when I had onion or garlic smell on my hands, I'd just rub my hands under water on the sides of the sink.  That worked, but now I have a ceramic sink.  This actually works really well due to the unique shape -- unlike the soap bar-shaped stainless bars, this one has these ridges that can get into the under part of your nails and other areas of your hands that a large, rounded bar can miss.  I still don't fully understand WHY stainless steel takes away the onion/garlic onion that is otherwise impervious to soap, but I don't really care!  The point is, it works...and it is attractive sitting on your sink, to boot.	1
My first time using stainless steep soap.  Looks great, but isn't quite as foolproof as claimed.  After cutting lemons, I used the soap as directed.  It mitigated, but didn't entirely eliminate the lemony fragrance from my hands.  It might work better after cutting more foul-stenched foods such as garlic/onions though.	1
The first time I heard about stainless steel soap was years ago when it was advertised to outdoorsmen for taking fish odors off of hands after fish cleaning.  Now they are touted for their ability to remove garlic and onion odors off of hands.  So I finally gave it a try.  The soap came with instructions to rub it between your hands like regular soap, under cold running water for 30-40 seconds.  I tried it after cutting up onions, and after smashing garlic. I must say that after my hands warmed up from 30-40 seconds of cold water washing with it, the odor was a little less potent, but by no means eliminated.  Others have had good results, but my experience was less than that. I don't know the premise behind why this should work to remove odors. All I know is it didn't do that much to remove odors from my hands. Perhaps it is a question of body chemistry for efficacy. Two stars for results that were not so good.	-1
I had heard of these types of cleaners but I had never used one. I'm not sure of the science behind this but it actually works! It is simple but well designed with a soap-like shape. Not sure how the cleansing properties behave over time but intuition tells me it should work forever.	1
I have used spoons and faucets in the past to get rid of onion and garlic scents from my hands.  This is a lovely little steel "soap" that does the same things.  It looks pretty on the countertop and is a nice size for my hands.  If the price is around $10 (no price on the product while I am writing this review), then I think it is a great little tool for the kitchen.  It makes a nice gift for an individual who loves to cook and works with a lot of onions and garlic.	1
The Zwilling J.A. Henckels Stainless Steel Soap works as advertised. The bar comes with minimal instructions, and the English instructions were covered with tape. Luckily the tape did not take off the instructions. I have used a different stainless steel bar before, so I had and idea on how they work. They are not like normal soap. When using this bar, here is my suggestions:  1. To get the smell off, the bar must come in contact with all skin that has the offending smell on it. Under the fingernails? No dice. they will smell. Even with missing the fingernails the smell is hugely diminished.  2. You must use the bar for a minimum of 40 seconds. A quick wipe will not do it. All skin must be scrubbed thoroughly, and the longer you scrub the  more effective it will be.  Compared to the soap shaped stainless steel bar I own, this one has curves. I was concerned about its functionality... until I used it. The curves make it easier to touch all the skin and remove the smell compared to my other one.  This product works well and I would recommend it.	1
I was so skeptical.  This actually does work.  Use this under running water and odors are truly reduced or eliminated.  Worked best on onion odor, slightly less on garlic and fish.	1
I was skeptical that this would work, but it did.  I tried it after handling some garlic.  Needless to say, my hands smelled.  I simply washed my hands with this stainless soap and the smell vanished.  The box said to wash your hands one time for 40 seconds.  I had to do it twice.  The first time the smell was significantly diminished, the second time the smell was completely gone.	1
Like other reviewers say, this really does work to reduce smells on your hands with just simple rubbing. Its elegant styling also makes it a great conversation starter, with people looking at it and asking for an explanation. A great addition to your kitchen.	1
I tested this after chopping a pile of garlic cloves and it substantially reduced the smell on my hands! I don't understand how it works but if it keeps me from having that sulfurous stink on my fingers for two days I won't question it! Perfect gift for a cook	1
My family does  a lot of preserving of food in the fall time.  We cook a lot of food and use a lot of smelly onions, garlic, and fish.  There are times when the onion smell is so strong, it lasts for days despite hours of dishwashing, showers, and hand scrubbing with everything you can imagine that is designed for cleaning hands.  The shape of the bar is pointed oval with two recessed areas on each side.  The surface is matte which allows for you to hold the bar and not drop it constantly and the water will run over it nicely too.  I also feel that the surface allows for more agitation of the skin surface (NOT abrasion) so that the odor source is more effectively removed as compared to smooth surface.  WHAT IS THIS "SOAP" GOOD FOR? I had heard of the stainless steel "soaps" being great for a whole host of things from removing kitchen smells from hands (onions, garlic, fish) to other organic smells.  Here is a brief list of what I have been told this would be good for:  -kitchen odors (onions, garlic, fish) -urine odors (cleaning diapers and pet trays) -body odor (under arm odor) -smelly feet odor (organic in origin, not from synthetic shoe smell) -unmentionable odors (I will leave that to your deduction skills)  That sounds like a tall order to fill.  I have tested for a variety of these odors so far and here is what I have found:  KITCHEN ODORS We have tried this with garlic, onions, and fish.  When using soap first on smells that are new on the skin and then using the stainless steel bar on the hands for 40-45 seconds under running water, 90-100% of odors are removed from the hands.  When the odors are older and have been on the skin for a while (such as cutting onions for a giant pot of French Onion Soup, or tons of garlic for garlic laden dishes), with or without soap, about 80% or more of the odors are removed.  That is still quite significant.  I have never had a big problem with fish smells on my hands.  In the autumn when we get local onions, that will be another time to test because they are the most powerful in terms of removing from skin that I have encountered EVER. No other onions the rest of the year compare to the local onions that time of year. I will update if there is more to report there. If this removes most of THAT odor, I will be thrilled.  URINE ODORS We have male rabbits and a cat.  This can make for a huge odor problem with things you have to wash or encounter in cleaning up.  I have found that using this bar as recommended after soap, almost all of the odor is gone consistently.  I would imagine this would also be applicable to mothers who have to contend with diapers and other baby messes involving organic origins.  BODY ODOR When using this in the shower, you can apply it to the under arms using the same principle (a bit tricky to keep water flowing on the area constantly compared to hands) I do find that it really does cut down on body odor more than not using it.  This would be a great idea to keep one in the shower for any family members who have a bit harder time with strong body odor.  SMELLY FEET I have not had the opportunity to use it yet as no one has had the problem recently.  I will update when I do.  UNMENTIONABLE ODOR Used once in a difficult situation during an illness that affected odor, it did help a lot.  This would be another reason to keep one in the shower for someone who has a difficulty in this area.  It is not chemical or harmful to the body and does help remedy the situation greatly.  THE BOTTOM LINE This stainless steel bar is not only great for reducing or eliminating kitchen odors, but also for pet urine, diaper smell, body odors of various kinds, and perhaps even more that I have not discovered as of yet.  The bar is designed to be a bit rougher in texture so that it will help more effectively get the odors off of the skin and keep it from slipping out of the hands when wet.  It is easy to hold and well designed.	1
This really does work and I will be using this for a very long time.  I bought a stainless steel plate about 2" x 2" a few years ago and have been using that until now.  This is so much easier to use as it shaped like a bar of soap and is easier to use than that steel plate.  I made a vegetable soup this weekend and I always put in about 7 cloves of garlic and this took the smell right off my hands.  It was really nice to be able to use this in between cutting onions, garlic, celery, cabbage and turnip.  Those are pretty stinky veggies and I hate having to have my hands smelling like them for hours after I peel and chop them up.  My hands were nice and clean and fresh smelling after getting my soup put together.  I would buy this in a heartbeat.	1
Steel soap really doesn't sound very useful. But apparently due to chemistry and stuff, something about molecules binding, steel removes certain strong scents such as onion and garlic. It feels odd rubbing your hands on a bar of metal, but who can argue with results?  This bar is really useful while cooking - you are constantly washing your hands, but don't want to use soap since then it gets all over the food (especially scent). It works with well with removing food scents, but I was especially happy when it removed the old sponge smell from my hands. I really hate that smell and can generally only cover it up with scented soap.  In addition to working, this bar is actually really cute looking. It is smaller than I expected, fitting comfortably in the palm of my hand. I like the shape as well. It looks very elegant.	1
Very nifty!  This small steel football actually does what it claims to do, which is remove those lingering onion and garlic smells from one's hands.  Simply pretend it is a bar of soap and massage your hands with it for 40 seconds, and voila, your hands are fragrant and fine smelling again. Highly recommend.	1
OK I admit it. I had no idea that stainless steel can be used to remove odors like fish,onions and garlic until I received an offer to use and then review this "soap".  The product is small (1.975 ounces), football shaped and frankly rather an elegant looking object to reside on a kitchen sink that fits comfortably in an adult hand when being used.  I wondered how on earth this works and Wikipedia tells me that "while staininless steel soap is sold by reputable sources, scientific evidence of its efficacy appears lacking.  One hypothesis is that these soaps work by binding the sulfur compounds found in substances such as onions and garlic."  While you are supposed to use the stainless steel soap with water a little experimentation showed that some strong food smells are removed just by using the soap along.  Further experimentation showed rubbing your hands on other stainless steel kitchen objects will also remove the odors.  This product is what I consider a practical novelty.  It is an item that might make a cute gift or souvenir for the cook who already has almost every other cooking related gadget and loves to try new things.	1
To be fair, I only started using this about three weeks ago, on the heels of using OZ Natural serums, including the Vitamin C with hyaluronic acid which I thought made a difference on my skin.  While this Juice Beauty smelled great and did moisturize my skin, I'm not seeing any astonishing results as far as "defying age" goes.  I like that one of the moisturizers has SPF 15. I like that the entire skin support kit is here, from cleansing to serum, to moisturizer to mask.	1
This is a nice set of beauty products.  Here are my impressions of the individual items in this set:  Green Apple Cleansing Gel - This is a great product.  It smells nice and leaves my face feeling clean, soft, and tingly.  My skin feels tighter after using it.  It is the largest bottle included, so you have enough for many uses.  Green Apple Age Defy Serum - This product, used in conjunction with the Peel, seemed to minimize the fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth.  It seemed to brighten and tighten my skin.  This comes in a tiny bottle.  Green Apple SPF 15 and Age Defy Moisturizers - I liked both of these.  They were good moisturizers and did not leave my face feeling greasy, which I can't stand.  Green Apple Peel - This peel had a slight odor which was unpleasant.  It was not overpowering, though.  The peel did make my face burn a tiny bit, during and after removing it.  However, it did improve the appearance of my fine lines and overall complexion.  Overall, I liked this set.  However, several of the bottles are so small, particularly the Age Defy Serum at .5 oz, that you will not get that many uses out of them unless you try to use them really sparingly.  So this is a good set for a gift or to buy just to try out the products.	1
I have been very impressed with this skin care kit. There is enough of each item to test them thoroughly. I also love the fact that this come with a day and night moisturizer. The moisturizers and the serum go on smooth, but do not feel greasy or heavy. The cleanser is perfect for an everyday cleanser and does not seem to clog pores.	1
I've been using this kit for a few weeks and am surprised and pleased that it works for me, an almost 60 fair skinned woman. Not to sound like an ad, I can already see a difference in the fine lines on my face and neck.  My skin looks more plumped out.  On deeper wrinkles I can still see the lines, but they are definately not as deep.  I like the products so much I'm buying the products in the larger size.  This kit will probably last 5-6 weeks.  I've been using it twice daily as directed for two weeks and can easily go another 2 weeks if not more. Face cleanser:  I like the slight scent which fades rapidly. It's a rather loose liquid, I only use about a quarter tsp for face, neck and decolletage.  Slight tingle during use. Serum:  this is a heavier gel, I apply and wait a few minutes before using moisturizer.  I find that it absorbs into my skin.  My face does not feel tight or greasy at all. Moisturizers:  I use the SPF during the day.  I find this takes a few minutes to absorb into my skin.  I use the regular moisturizer in the evening and that seems to absorb more quickly.  However, for me - it takes a few minutes for any sunscreen to absorb so this didn't bother me, I thought it's the nature of sunscreen products. Peel:  thin gel goes on easily, comes off easily.  There is no dried cakey feeling which I can't stand. I'd recommend this kit if you're looking to get a good samples size to try out for a month.  In fact, I have recommended it to a few friends. I previously used products by NuSkin, which are more expensive than these.  I did notice the slightest  red of my face the first few days I used the cleansing gel...but I don't anymore.  I'm trying to switch to all organic products for skin and body care and these certainly fit the bill.	1
I was real excited to order this product. I have always had good looking skin, but as I grow older, I notice dry skin and fine lines developing. I like this travel size and received the kit just in time for my trip to Hawaii. After a week of use, I really like the results. The product has a clean fresh smell and is organic as well. I really like the way my face feels after I use it. It is a great skin product.	1
I am over 50 and find these products to me gentle and helpful.  The full strength peel, which you are only supposed to do once a week, is definitely powerful.  It tingles on the skin and my skin was a bit red afterward.  But it helped with my enlarged pores and evened the color out (after the redness died down - several hours, so do this at night before bed).  The moisturizers are good, but not anything to shout about and the serum may be doing something but I'm not sure yet.  Unfortunately the applicator for the serum doesn't work, so I open the bottle each time and dab some on my finger to apply to my face.  The apple scent is very light and pleasant.	1
What I like best about this Juice Beauty Age Defying Solutions Kit, is that you can test out 5 products, without having to buy each product separately. The Age Defy Serum alone is $52.00 and the Apple Peel is $45.00- that's $97.00 for only 2 of these 5 items, making this a great deal to try out 5 items for $39.00. These are small, but larger than sample sizes that will last you about a month and a half, that are worth buying, so you can find out which products actually works for you before spending the bigger cash for the full sizes- and you will find something you like in this kit, as I and everyone I know has. Some of these products are really spa quality great.  I have a combination skin type- some dry spots, some oily- nothing extreme, but I can testify to how these products affect both oily or dry skin. I think it easiest to give a description of each of these 5 products to attest to how effective they were for me. GREEN APPLE CLEANSING GEL- This cleansing gel both deeply cleans and exfoliates your skin. With lemon, apple and sugar cane hydroxy acids, you'll feel the deep cleaning, yet with no redness or irritations. The best part of this cleansing, is that it is neither dry or greasy, leaving your skin feel simply clean and smooth. The results were excellent rating 4 1/2 Stars.  GREEN APPLE AGE DEFY SERUM- This serum pumps out of a bottle, and states to use it after the cleansing gel to firm and brighten your skin and reduce fine lines. I found that other face serums/products will do the same thing for way less money. The thing I didn't like about this serum, is that it just doesn't blend into my skin well, due to the texture being so thick/shiny- it just sat on my skin. This is just an average serum that reduces fine lines as well as my cheaper overnight face creams/serums, so for that I give it 4 Stars.  GREEN APPLE PEEL FULL STRENGTH- This peel is simple- after cleaning your face well, apply a good layer to your face, leave on for 10 minutes, then rinse really well. This peel will exfoliate your dead skin just as well as any high priced spa treatment. Your face will tingle and turn red, so you will only want to use this before bed. You don't want to use this before going out, as the tingling and redness take a few hours to go away. This product is colorless. You will not believe your skin after this treatment- it smoothed out my dry and oily patches! My entire skin was as smooth as silk! This is the BEST rinse off peel ever and deserves 5 Stars. To get your skin feeling this perfect, you would have to go to an upscale spa/salon.  GREEN APPLE SPF 15 MOISTURIZER- This moisturizer is for daily use, especially protective from the sun's rays with it's Zinc Oxide protection. I can see this being a great product for anyone with really dry skin, because it has a really greasy and heavy texture, but for me with just average skin, it is simply too greasy, so I have to give it an average 4 Stars.  GREEN APPLE AGE DEFY MOISTURIZER- This moisturizer states it both firms and reduces wrinkles, but again, I didn't see it do anything different that any of my much cheaper moisturizers do. Like the Age Defy Serum, it also doesn't blend into my skin very well- another product that seems to sit on top of my skin. I found this to be a very average moisturizer, that I can get cheaper with other products, so for that reason it gets an average 4 Stars.  I wish Juice Beauty had included a small size of their Stem Cellular Repair Eye Treatment with this Kit. This Eye Treatment is another high upscale Spa type treatment that leaves you feeling and looking fresh, smooth and fabulous, like their Peels and Cleansers. I love the fact that Juice Beauty's products are made with organic ingredients and anti-oxidants and especially with Co-Q10. Co-Q10 replaces oxygen in every cell in your body, and that keeps your cells moving and healthy. Overall, this is a great introduction to Juice Beauty's products and you will definitely find something great in this kit like I did, earning this Kit 4 1/2 Stars.	1
When I first received the Age Defy Solutions, I was a bit disappointed when I opened the package and it was what I call "trial size" bottles.  I hate it when products have $69 value for $39 when, in fact, there is only about $25 worth of product in the entire package.  I honestly don't know how you are expected to see if a product works when you only receive about one week's worth of actual product.  For my review, I used all the products twice a day as recommended, the Apple peel being the only product I used once as you use it only once a week. 1. Green Apple Cleansing Gel:  The first thing that happened when I opened the tube to use the cleanser, it was extremely liquid like water, it shot right out all over my hand and counter top.  The cleanser either needs to be thicker or they need a smaller opening.  Secondly, it smelled like Lemon Pledge. I don't know where the Green Apple comes into play as I walked around for two days with that Lemon Pledge smell in my nose.  Also, I noticed it is extremely gentle.  Yes, you want your cleanser to be gentle, but you also want it to clean.  It didn't clean off the red marks left on my lips from a flavored bottled water in black raspberry that I drink frequently.  I scrubbed and scrubbed and still red marks, so I had to use my regular cleanser to get them off.  Also, it barely cleaned off my eye liner and mascara.  To top it off, seven days into using the product, I have a break-out and I haven't had one in months. 2. The Exfoliant Peel I liked quite a bit.  My skin felt really clean and smooth. 3. The Age Defy Serum I also liked but it didn't even last seven days, but it burned my face. 4. Green Apple Moisturizer: This is the product I hated the most.  It was like spreading cement onto your skin and having to use a trowel to smear it around.  It did not absorb into the skin.  It took quite a bit of tugging to even get it to spread onto my face.  Frankly, I don't like having to pull on my skin to get a moisturizer to blend in.  I hated it so much that after four days of twice a day, I said enough and quit using it.  This is a horrible moisturizer.  I have never used something with this tough texture.  I hated it. 5. Green Apple Age Defy Moisturizer:  I liked the moisturizer fairly well, but for a night time moisturizer, for my age, (middle 50's) it wasn't thick enough.  When I smoothed it onto my skin it became even thinner and turned white like a thin lotion.  But I did like how my skin looked after I used it.  However, after the serum and the moisturizer, my neck and cheeks were red and my skin burned for quite some time after use. To sum my review up, I would not buy these products ever again, nor would I recommend these products.  They aren't "user friendly" and definitely are not worth the price tag.	-1
I'm officially a fan of Juice all natural skin oroducts.  I've been using the daily moisturizer, the blemish peel and the sensitive skin peel for several weeks now and my "fair sensitive breaks out over everything" skin looks outstanding.  I've gotten 1-2 comments a day in the last few weeks about how radiant I look.  Really does something for the self-esteem for us women of a certain age to hear that!  This kit includes an "age defy serum" which goes on like a light gel and is worn under your moisturizer.  I have noticed in the last two weeks my skin has felt really dry and tight, this has made a big difference.  I wish they made all over body serum like this!  I think this would make a great gift for someone who would appreciate a higher end skin product, but I took off one star because the sizes you get with this are small sample size, not full size and I think that they are priced too high for it to be a good deal.  I'd pay $20 for this and feel like I was giving a very nice gift without breaking the bank.	1
I am not super impressed with the product. The pump mechanism on the age defying serum was broken making it so I was unable to even try it. The rest of the kit worked fine but I wasn't a fan of the smell. It wasn't very pleasant and almost had a chemical smell to them. The face wash doesn't lather up much which would take some getting used to. After using it my skin felt ok but I didn't notice any spectacular results. I will probably use it as a travel set as it is a nice compact size.	-1
Although I like all but one of these products, I think the packaging is very deceptive.  First, the products. I love all of them except for the cleansing gel. It's foamy, and I much prefer a non-lathering facial cleanser. It was okay, and then I used the peel. Even though my face is very sensitive, it did a good job. (A skin patch test is recommended, but I skipped it. It was pretty mild.) Then I used the Age Defy Moisturizer on most of my face, and applied the serum around my eyes. Again, I was very pleased. I love that the products are made from natural organic ingredients, but I searched the box and labels to see if it wasn't tested on animals, but I couldn't find any such statement. Bummer.  And now the packaging. The lightweight box says it's made from from sustainably sourced paper. That's nice, but recycled paper would be better. The individual products were wrapped in white tissue paper, so plastic is kept to a minimum.  My big problem? The box says "Products Shown At Actual Size".  Which is true. Both the Gel Cleanser and the Serum were full containers. But the other 3 products; the Age Defy Moisturizer, SPF 15 Moisturizer, and Green Apple Peel, are all in identical tubes, and were way less than half full when I first received them. To make sure, I haven't tried the SPF 15 yet (it's been cloudy and rainy and I've been inside most of the day), but I thoroughly shook the tube to let it settle, shown a flashlight behind it, and the product barely came up to the bottom of the text, above the circle, as you can see in the illustration. You have to read the very tiny tiny print on the bottom of the box to see the these 3 tubes each contain .5 oz.. It's also marked on each tube, but you wouldn't know this until you bought the entire box. As a control, I took this photo of a Bert's Bees product next to the Juice Beauty SPF 15. Both contain 0.5 oz..  It was nice to try this product on Vine. As far as the products, 4 1/2 stars. As far as the packaging, 0 stars.	-1
This is nice little starter kit of Juice Beauty skin solutions to keep signs of aging at bay. I especially like the Cleansing Gel. It makes my skin soft and clean. (I've recently tried the Stem Cellular Cleansing Oil-which I like too, but use it less often) The moisturizers are good--nothing special, but one is to use at night and one during the day. The Age Defy Serum needs to be applied sparingly, but it feels nice and cool, not greasy. The only thing I haven't tried is the Full Strength Peel, which I'll try this weekend and update review. Overall, I'm really happy with this product line. At my age, I like all the help I can get. My reason for four stars (not five) is because I don't think the products have a very good scent. Others have mentioned citrus scent, but I don't smell that at all...just kind of medicinal. Overall, great products that I recommend.  Update: I tried the mask. It didn't give any kind of irritation or redness to my skin. My face feels soft.	1
I have used a few Juice Beauty products, but this is my first time using a whole system of products that are designed to work together. Even though I have been using Retin-A, this kit works well with my skin and I haven't experienced any irritation, not even with the peel. In fact, the peel cleared up some dry patches caused by the retinoid (and the dry Fall weather) it gave my skin a soft and glowing even tone. Wrinkles and fine lines are less noticeable and I'm sure they will improve more as time goes on...with using the products regularly. My favorites in this kit are the peel, the serum, and the "age defy" moisturizer. My skin drank up the moisturizer even though it felt a bit heavier than the day cream (with spf). The day cream does have a slight "whitening" effect (due to titanium dioxide) and may be visible on darker complexions, especially if not worn under makeup. Using less, allowing it to "soak in a bit" or rubbing into the skin a bit more may help correct this. I mixed some of the age defy moisturizer to diffuse it, I most likely lost some SPF by doing this but it looked better on my skin. The serum is awesome, particularly around the eyes. The goal of this kit is to help the cells turn over and reveal softer and more even toned complexion. It works perfectly in this regard as a low level AHA & BHA peel (with supporting products) that can be used by all skin types, except, perhaps...more sensitive skin. I'm very pleased with the results, and intend to at least continue using the peel and the moisturizer when this kit is finished. I love how my skin feels, the new glow I have, and the ease of applying makeup. Highly recommended!	1
Juice makes so many interesting products!  I have tried Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser. This product lathers well and rinses clean; I like the feel on my skin. The scent is not typical, but it doesn't bother me. It takes a very small amount to wash my face, so this container will last longer than I expected.  I have also used the Juice Beauty Green Apple Age Defy Serum.  The feel and texture of this serum is very nice, and the smell is pleasant without being overpowering. My skin is fragile due to ongoing chemotherapy, so I am always looking for a moisturizer or something similar to protect my skin. I think this is a winner. This kit Includes: 2.0 oz. GREEN APPLE(tm) Cleansing Gel 0.5 oz. GREEN APPLE(tm) Peel Full Strength 0.25 oz. GREEN APPLE(tm) Age Defy Serum 0.5 oz. GREEN APPLE(tm) SPF 15 Moisturizer 0.5 oz. GREEN APPLE(tm) Age Defy Moisturizer	1
I started paying more attention to my skin particularly my face this year...I started early in the year with a professional chemical peel and after seeing/feeling the difference I decided to stay on top of my skincare (I was under the false impression I was too young to be bothered with it). The Juice Beauty Age Defying Solutions Kit and the line in general is definitely above average and fairly priced. I find it gently exfoliates, tightens, brightens and smoothes my skin. I will definitely be using it again. It helps me maintain clear and soft skin. Of course that it is organic is a massive plus.	1
I do like this facial kit - be advised that all the sizes in this kit are more sample sizes (not full sizes), but they are great to give the product line a try, and are also perfect for travel.  I love that this skin care kit is organic.  I really like to know what I'm putting on my skin.  My skin feels nice and clean after using this (although I tend to not like moisturizer with sunscreen, so I haven't been using that one - it tends to leave my combination skin feeling oily after a while).  My favorite products are the serum and the night cream.  I don't really care for the gel cleanser as it goes on lightly but it doesn't really do much as far as I can tell.  I prefer something that lathers a bit.  And the peel is ok - I've used it twice, and both times I left it on for the suggested 10 minutes, and rinsed it off, but did not feel the warmth or tingling that they said would happen.  Being 100% honest, I like the Somme Institute skin care line better.  My skin feels really good when I'm using that set, and it is proven to be good for your skin as well.  So this set is good, but I like that one better.	1
I have been trying various 3-free and water based nail polishes lately as I have gotten concerned about some of the toxic chemicals in the other polishes.  I admit, I balked at the thought of the price on the London Butter, but liked this color well enough to try.  Butter goes on somewhat thinner than other polishes but the color does not look weak or runny.  Additional layers make the color stand out more.  With a good top coat, the color lasted a full seven days on me, which is very unusual as I am quite hard on the nails.  This particular color is very beautiful-classy, not too bold and not too light.  I was afraid it might be too much for the conservative work place, but found it to be just right.  The bottle is very cute, just had to mention that.  I will buy more of Butter, but just a few of my favorite shades.  (very hard to narrow them down as all the shades are nice!!)  I am hoping the price will come down some.	1
I'm not usually one for neutral nail colors, but Aston has just enough sparkle and zip!  It wore off very quickly when I didn't use a base coat (wonder if it's my nails or just how rough I am on them?!)  Butter London is great!!	1
Great Color long lasting	1
Love this brand and I love this color. It's a bit more subtle than the glitter stuff I bought locally. I like that this brand doesn't have a lot of bad chemicals in it and I've tried 3 or 4 other colors of this brand and I really do like it. I use the topcoat and then my color with a final clear coat. My goal is to replace my existing colors with this brand.	1

This review is for the "Scallywag" shade, a lovely blue/teal glitter polish.  I think it's great.  I put it on my toes and it still looked perfect several days later.  It was very easy to apply, despite the glitter (which can sometimes make polish less smooth -- but not in this case!).  It did take three coats to become opaque, instead of the usual two.  However, since it's mostly glitter without a base color, that's not too bad.  I used a Seche Vite quick-dry topcoat (no base coat) and it helped this polish to dry quickly.  I thought the brush was nice.  I kind of don't like the rectangular "extra" black cap on top of the applicator, though.  It seems like a waste of plastic and it was a little difficult for me to remove, for some reason.  However, overall, this is a good polish -- even if it's been sitting around for close to a year (just shake it up a bit) and I think I will get many uses out of it.  Free of lots of different toxic ingredients, as well.  Update: Two weeks later, some of the glitter had rubbed off my smallest toes.  However, that's still pretty long wear.  Also, this was one of the easier glitter polishes I've tried when it comes to removal.	1
I've never sent his color before but since I'm a big fan of butter! I wanted to give it a try.  It's beautiful and unique.  I know the description says yellow and gold but depending in the light it looks like it has green tones as well.  When you wear this color, you won't see anyone else with anything similar.  You can't go wrong with any of Butter's colors.  I have olive skin and this color goes well with my skin tone.  If you have very fair skin or skin with a yellow undertone you may want to try a sample from a friend before buying	1
This is an unusual color of blue as are most Butter colors.  Very pretty and I would recommend this for all skin to e's.	1
The color itself is great.  The polish is clumpy. So much glitter that its almost pasty. I've decided to but a nail polish thinner to see if that helps and if it does I will update but at this point I can't use it.  For the money I expected higher quality	-1
Butter LONDON has got to be one of my favorite brands of nail polish and being able to get this at a discounted price thanks to the marketplace made this nail polish even better. If you're going to splurge on anything, splurge on this (:	1
Love all lanza products.	1
this is one of the nicest shampoos I've ever used- luxurious!  Love how it feels, smells, etc-	1
I am a 42 year old female with fine brown hair that is colored blond, which is cut in a bob to my shoulders. I use the Lanza product line and have tried almost all of their products. I use the Color Care shampoo and conditioner as my daily routine, and switch to the Strengthening shampoo and conditioner (with the Healing Oil) when my hair gets dry and/or starts breaking/falling out more than usual (due to a medical condition).  I decided to try the Thickening shampoo and matching conditioner to see if it would help. My hair is fine and has no volume, but I hate to use a lot of products on it as it always seems to leave a residue or feel greasy by the end of the day. Thus, I wanted to find a way to "plump" up my hair with just the shampoo and conditioner where possible.  You can use this on a daily basis. I used it for about 2 weeks every day with the conditioner.  I noticed a difference after the first use!  Within about 4 days, I noticed the change even more - it gave my hair more thickness, without it feeling greasy or frozen in place like some volumizers do. It also made it shiny, which was a nice bonus since that was not my top priority in choosing this product.  In summary, based on experience, I do keep this in shower and rotate it in my regular routine as I need some plumping of my hair but I don't use it on a daily basis (but you definitely could).	1

This is it, folks: The Holy Grail of cover-ups. The magic elixir that hides all crimes against beauty. The youth restorer. The magician that creates the illusion that you're well rested. The melasma nullifier. The acne obscurer. This one stick does it all and lasts absolutely for ages. Seriously, I can get years out of one stick.  It covers in one try if you apply correctly -- dot on and pat with a fingertip, blending -- and you have the correct shade. It is absolutely critical to get the right hue. Order a sample pack if you've never used Dermablend before because you can't rely on what your screen shows you. You can apply it over foundation or under it -- either works. I set it with powder, but even without setting, it sticks pretty well.  Seriously, for those of us without flawless skin, this is the Equalizer.	1
Wife says- Really good product. smooth in application and stays for about 3-4 hours. I use it mainly for contouring and hiding spots on the face. I do apply it in layers the very first time ensuring that the skin absorbs enough of it. I do not have sensitive skin but products that are low-quality tend to break out my skin. It's not the case with the Dermablend foundation. I apply it with a makeup buff, set it with Dermablend face powder and spray face mist, which helps it set on my skin beautifully.	1
I love this concealer stick. A little bit goes a long way. You just dab it on and then blend. After, I put my BB cream or foundation on top for a smooth look and end with some powder. This stick really helps to make my skin look clearer and brings down the red. Overall, I am a big fan.	1
Very nice concealer from Dermablend.  They make amazing products, and this is awesome, too.  It applies very easily, (you only need a tiny bit), and the product stays put all day.  You can make it last even longer by using their setting powder (I like the translucent one).  it didn't irritate my skin at all, either.  Great stuff.  As always, it's best to check out colors in person before buying online.  This was a little darker than I'd expected.	1
I had a little filler injected which resulted in some faint green bruising and wanted to cover it...  thought this should do the dtrick but there was very little coverage whatsoever.	-1
Coverage is good! Formula is on the drier side, which is nice because it stays put better.  I do have to re=apply once or twice during the day.  A tiiiiiny little bit is all that is needed to cover spots, so I anticipate this lasting me until it expires in a year or so.	1
Dermablend Quick-Fix is a classic stick type quick concealer in a convenient carry tube that fits easily in pocket or purse. The concealer is perfect for quick touch-ups throughout the day with no fuss. The concealer is easy to apply and takes just a couple seconds to blend in for excellent blemish hiding. The concealer is long lasting, even on my oily skin I find I don't have to reapply to any one spot throughout the day.  I've got mildly sensitive skin, yet this concealer does not irritate my skin at all. I am also pleased with the SPF 30 rating of this product. It just adds a little extra protection for those concerned with sun exposure.	1
The hardest thing about buying cosmetic online is in picking the right shade. That said, the consistency of this concealer is spot on (no pun intended). I've got oily skin and it covers pretty well. I can apply a small dot and tap, then finish with powder and my spots are 'covered'. Unfortunately, this particular shade does not blend with my skin color, so I can't actually use it. So while I do like the quality of this concealer stick, I still have to hunt down the right color shade.	1
This was very thick and sticky. It does not move well at all. It might just be me but I think it is a little too dark as well. I personally would not buy this again.	-1
Dermablend Quick-fix Concealer Stick With Spf 30 for Full Coverage concealer stick good for blemishes, under eye circles, scars and balancing out irregular tones on skin.  It goes on smoothly and has good staying power, lasting as long as 16 hours.  The colors blend well and provide comfortable, natural looking and long lasting results.	1
I'm a big fan of Dermablend.  The creams and lotions blend well with other shades and on the skin for a natural look.  Bruises and skin discolorations are well concealed.  The blend lasts a few hours before one notices the creams crease in pores.  This is great for face, arms and legs and works well in photography.  I've never had a bad reaction from this brand.	1
I have very dark inherited circles around my eyes and have tried many concealers in the hopes of finding one that not only covers but does not crease.  I have found it in this concealer from Dermablend.  The product goes on easily with the finger.  It lasts the day without creasing or discoloring.  This shade was perfect for me.  I have always heard that Dermablend had good products and am so glad they sent me this one to try.  I recommend it for anyone with large dark circles!	1
10 Styles: 40n Caramel - I am fair complected and this worked wonderfully for daytime wear. simpler, quicker, fits easily in a small purse, and less mess then liquid concealer - I can't see going back.	1
I am satisfied with this eye cream.	1
The color was a bit dark for me, so I basically used it to cover the dark spots on my hands and on my chest area.  The coverage is phenomenal and covered my dark spots completely, and it stayed all day until I used a make up cloth to remove it.  The coverage on my chest was amazing as I wore a V neck  shirt and it was 90 degrees and it still stayed put. The only issue I had with it was it is very thick and I had to thin it out with moisturizer to apply it smoothly.  This is my first time using Dermablend so I am not sure if this is how the product usually is. There are so many colors to choose from so I would recommend purchasing this somewhere where you can try the colors before you purchase to get an exact match.	1
Dermablend's Quick-Fix Concealer Stick with SPF is smooth and creamy as a lipstick. Packaged similarly too. Goes on smoothly and stays smooth without moving into wrinkles or migrating in any other way. Stays put all day and into the evening. Has none of the waxy or cakey feel that some other concealers have. Just fine, smooth, easy-to-apply coverage that really keeps blemishes and other discolorations hidden all day without drawing attention to itself. On me, most concealers eventually move into lines and wrinkles and make me look worse, not better. Dermablend doesn't do that. It's a great brand that is true to its claims.	1
Another winner from Dermablend! I was only introduced to Dermablend products this year and have loved what I have found. The Quick-Fix Concealer Stick is amazing. At 57 I have dark spots, under eye darkness and a dark place from where I had a mole removed. With no makeup instead of looking like a smooth canvas, my face looks like a roadmap. So many concealers just add a layer leaving face uneven when applying my makeup. That is not the case with the Dermablend concealer. This goes on creamy, almost like butter, and feels great on my skin. My foundation goes on smoothly afterwords. I could not be more pleased with this product!	1
Perfect for covering up unexpected cat scratches, under eye circles, or that annoying zit that pops up right before a big event. Blends in seamlessly.	1
Foremost, rather than guessing at your shade (because there are so many), find your correct shade in the mall and then buy the product here (you are going to find better prices here and your next order will be much easier than driving to the mall).  Like all Dermblend products, you want to begin very lightly. So, if you are using this for under your eyes, go lightly. Then use a Beauty Blender or brush. Then apply your foundation. Then dust on (or pat on) a layer of translucent powder. If you still see slight "circles," try just a touch more of this stick next time. You do not want to over-apply. By adding very slowly and blending very carefully, you should be able to achieve a truly natural look.  This is absolutely fantastic for under-eye circles. Go lightly and it should not settle into creases.  Highly recommended!	1
The shade was a little darker than I expected but it is a very good concealer.  It looked better on my daughter than me.  The coverage is very thick but I suspect that is for people who have a tattoo to cover up as needed.  Easy to apply, a bit difficult to blend.  Still it's very nice.	1
Dermablend is amazing.  It covers everything up easily and does not sweat off.  You have yo use soap to get it off and then it comes off easily.	1
I think this is a great concealer - I am really impressed by it!  It goes on extremely smoothly, provides good coverage, and looks great.  It weirded me out a little bit, because it looks like a lipstick tube, and I have not previously encountered concealer that is like that.  However, once you get past that initial oddity, this is a really great find - easy to put on, lasts all day.	1
I really like the DERMABLEND products and this concealer is no exception. I have dark circles under my eyes and want a concealer that covers them, but will also blend with my make-up and this does exactly that.  It comes in a tube that is about the size of lipstick which makes for easy application. I roll the make-up out of the tube a bit and swipe it across the dark area under my eyes. It blends in nicely without looking thick or cakey. It looks natural and has the moderate coverage that I need.  I do not have any settling into the lines around my eyes. I am very impressed the LOreal  DERMABLEND line of make-up.  The color is intense and smooth. This is also the perfect touch-up for long days at work that transition into long evenings and a little make-up is needed after eating or drinking. It is small enough to drop into your purse and at .16 oz it can travel with you anywhere. I like that it is made in the USA and has no annoying smells.	1
It feel very light and it blends smoothly into your skin.  You might need more than one layer to properly cover whatever it is that you're covering, but it doesn't cake or feel greasy at all.  It leaves your skin looking flawless.  Non-scented, easy to apply.  Could probably blend easily with your other make-up.  Good product.  5 stars.	1
I really like Dermablend products, and this concealer goes on nice and easy, but it does not cover age spots.  It made my two look lighter, but you could still see them.  In all fairness, the directions say to use powder after using the concealer, which I did not do.  Still, I'm very happy to have this concealer for possible future problems, and am really glad to have discovered Dermablend products.  They are costly, compare do the usual drugstore cosmetics I buy, but they go on well, stay on well, and look natural.	1
I absolutely LOVE Dermablend's makeup line. They have truly come up with a foundation and concealer that blends amazingly. There is never that caked on layered look. I like that I can build on top of it and have that flawless blend that I have always sought after with my makeup but have not been able to obtain until now. This particular bottle was a little too dark for my shade but would be great for someone with caramel or maybe even olive tones. It is so easy to apply. You just open by twisting the top and you squeeze some out on a finger or a sponge and apply like you would any other makeup. SO I got one that did match my skin tones and the coverage is AMAZING, The concealer sticks along with the smooth camo foundation covers all my blemishes and skin irritants flawlessly. That really helps boost a girls self esteem when she can look in the mirror and her cystic acne is being well covered, Dermablend is created by certified dermatologist which is great because they know how to keep irritants out of the makeup they are creating, My skin doesn't breakout like it does with supermarket makeup when I use the Dermablend, I couldn't ask for a better makeup line to have fallen in love with.	1
Review of: "Dermablend Quick-Fix Concealer Stick with SPF 30 for Full Coverage, 35C Medium, 0.16 oz.."  This is a concealer that does everything you think that it would do.  You simply choose your skin shade and apply.  For some people reapplication may become necessary throughout the day.  The manufacturer's product description lists: "Our ultimate full coverage concealer makeup formulated for all skin types including the most sensitive skin. Provides Broad-spectrum SPF 30 and all-day hydration. Super saturated concealer stick with high-performance pigments. The creamy texture is never cakey or mask-like. Concealer glides on smoothly to act as a blemishes and acne scar concealer, dark circles concealer and under eye concealer. Does not enhance the look of lines, wrinkles or pores. Skin feels comfortable and looks naturally flawless. Provides maximum cover for up to 16 hours of consistent smudge - and transfer-resistant color wear - when set with Dermablend Setting Powder. Product packaging may vary. dermatologist tested. allergy tested. non-comedogenic. non-acnegenic. fragrance free. sensitive skin tested. Inactive ingredients: mineral oil, talc, beeswax, isopropyl palmitate, stearyl stearate, kaolin, magnesium carbonate, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, allantoin, microcrystalline."  All-in-all a good product.  Wife uses and approves.  Five stars.	1
The grand daughter swears by this stuff.  She has one area of her lower chin that is prone to acne outbreaks and this stick helps her cover it completely.  She doesn't use anything else and the tones are true to color so order according to your own skin tone.  She only has to apply once in the morning with maybe a late afternoon touch up.  She gives it five stars.	1
This is a nice concealer. It is easy to apply. I struggle with dry skin and so I have to make sure that my skin is really moisturized before I apply this or else it just accents the dry skin.	1
This more or less has the consistency of lipstick, it glides on really easily and doesn't cake. I use it particularly for my cleavage since I tend to get little red pimples there and find them embarrassing. I usually don't do more than apply this and blend it in. The fact that is has SPF is a great touch which I appreciate even more when I've got a lot to cover up.	1
Great product, great container.  The quick fix concealer is wonderful for those problem area.  Apply as much or as little as you like.  With the lip stick type container, you have full control.  Just pat a little at a time on until you reach your desired result, smooth out the edges to blend,  and I use a translucent powder to set.  You will be good for the whole day.  I have used many Dermablend products and have had no issues.  I love they are dermatologist tested, provides me with confidence in the product.  With a great product, a great price and easily accessible, what more could you ask.	1
Wow. This Dermablend brand is amazing. I am no make up professional, but I have to say this cream cover goes on extremely well, and it covers any spot or blemish you have on your face. It does provide coverage, complete coverage. I found best used with an applicator. The tone matched the color extremely well, and it smoothes in nicely.	1
Dermablend Professional Quick-Fix Full Coverage Concealer Brown 60W (****) is darker than a most popular medium beige, but it has an interesting application for concealing & neutralizing makeup not by hiding blemishes and discoloration in order to achieve an almost perfectly uniform appearance, which is extremely rare and thus uncommon, but by greatly reducing their intensity to make them appearing like a natural variation of color typical to us additionally intensifying with aging.  It is especially useful to cover more reddish blemishes and discoloration, so the resulting hue, which is a product of making Brown slightly more reddish, becomes a typical natural variant.  In other words, of 2 methods: (1) to choose a color matching the complexion to cover entirely the discolorations, or (2) to choose the Brown color and to cover the discolorations with a thinner layer showing slightly trough, the second is much cheaper, as using much less creme, and does not produce artificial, mask-like effect, but requires more artist-like skills and also use of Setting Powder on the top to finish and protect the result.	1
This is a good concealer for me.  I have a lot of dark  marks on my cheeks left from acne scars and this cover up worked very well to conceal this.  The color was a little darker than I expected but was light enough to use on my skin which is pretty pale.  The only hang up might be the price because you can use a Wet,N,Wild or Cover Girl concealer for a few dollars that works just as well.	1
This is a rich, creamy concealer that blends easily. I have the natural shade. I have fair to light skin tone and use this color as an under-the-eye concealer (I go with a slightly darker shade if I am using it a quick-fix for a blemish) and then add a little powder to set. It's long-lasting and wears well.	1
My tan-complection Filipina wife LOVES Dermablend.  She has many different tones on her face and body, so she has several different shades she uses rather than trying to make everything the same color.  It turns out fantastic the way she does it.  I wish I could put a video up of her before, applying and after.  I've never seen any of her make-ups come out so well... plus it has a helpful SPF to keep her from getting darker (yes she gets darker with sun exposure).  She's had a zit problem ever since arriving in the USA and has tried many products to stop them.  The only thing that has worked was going back to Philippines for 3 months.  We have no idea if it's something in the ingredients of something she eats here, or some sort of spray on the vegetables... but she hides it when she wants to look really nice with an application of Dermablend products.  She has 5 different creams, a couple of powders and 2 sticks, varying shades of tan.  She can apply them very quickly now, but of course had to study them carefully for what worked where and such.  I'm pleased that Dermablend is available for people like her, though it's a little expensive for the amount you get (my frugal opinion).  She's worth it!  Afternote:  I asked her to read over some of the one star reviews from people who were not happy with the results and she could only say maybe they don't clean their face properly and that they should watch some of the zillion YouTube tutorials.	1

Review of: "Dermablend Quick-Fix Concealer Stick 30C Light 0.16 oz," by Dermablend Professional.  Great concealer.  The manufacturer's product description states: "Our ultimate full coverage concealer makeup formulated for all skin types including the most sensitive skin.

My wife claims that this is one of the better if not best concealers she has used.  The cover stays all day and does not cause any skin irritation.  Well done.  Five stars.	1
Dermablend Quick-Fix Concealer Stick is as great as the rest of the Dermablend  product line. The applicator disperses the product easily and that helps with those quick make-up fixes! The concealer stick make up is just as easy to apply onto the skin. It's very smooth and silky and blends well into the skin. I've worked with other products that were much heavier and unnatural, so the smoothness of the product is a big plus to experience with the Dermablend stick. I should also add that I've worked with some make-up sticks that are fragile and break off, not this one. It is firm and appears like it will last until the very end.  It definitely covers dark circles well and doesn't patch up around the eyes, which is another big  attribute. After proper application, the product lasts long and wears well for hours. My only concern, thus, the one missing star, is although I've had no breakouts or irritation from the brand, my face, where I apply the product, feels a bit slicker than the rest of my face. Of course, everyone is different and will experience different results.	1
Another Dermablend hit - I really like their products.  This concealer stick has a good amount of SPF (30) and blends into my skin perfectly. It is full coverage so a little goes a long way. It is not cakey, but again be sure to not use too much.  It comes in a tube (similar to lipstick) making it easy to apply. I have so many sun spots and redness on my face and this helps conceal them perfectly.  Make sure to set it with a little loose powder after application to help it last all day.  Highly recommended!	1
The quick fix concealer is in a lipstick type twist applicator.  Each time I have used it is smashes down and doesn't go on smoothly.  It takes a lot of work to blend it in.  I think the product is too thick to go on small areas of the face.	-1
I received this product for an honest review. I don't normally use a concealer stick, however, lately Ive needed to cover a couple of dark spots and thought Id try the Dermablend Quick-Fix Conceal-er Stick. The concealer went on smoothly, the ivory was a good color match. I like that it has an SPF 30 rating. It did a nice job of covering dark spots on my arm and face but not so good at concealing the dark areas under the eyes. Still, it worked well for the intended pur-pose and I can give it a full four stars.	1
I'm one of those people who can't do heavy makeup.  Maybe I have a 'sensory issue' but any sort of weighty makeup makes me want to grab a washcloth and scrub.  This concealer works pretty well.  It's better for dark circles than dark spots.  (Thanks to my Husband for letting me use hi as a test subject.)  With a little aid it covers rosacea.  I can't wear it everywhere because it's a bit greasy and a bit heavy.  I can wear it on my cheeks but not under my eyes.  It's just to heavy.  My teen, on the other hand, has no problems with the weight.  She goes to high school several times a week with full war paint on.  This works perfectly to hide those little blemishes.	1
I got this to go with my Dermablend Intense Powder Camo makeup in Natural, and the light shade was about one click darker than I usually go but works well for me in the summer. I use it under my eyes, and it's so hard to find a product with SPF for eye area usage and this being in the Dermablend line made it was hard to contain myself from buying it before I settled on a shade. I went to a local store that had open testers, then I left to buy it online for the better price. I figured out what shades will work well for me in the summer vs. the winter so I was happy to have used the testers. It is very creamy, so much so that I may have to change to a more waterproof eyeliner because it makes it run a bit. Also I was used to needing to use more product, I can use less with this, really just a few dots here and there an and then blend it in. For me it does have enough pigment to use it like that. I'm very happy with this product and fully intend to keep on using it. I would also recommend it to anyone.	1
While comfortable and non-irritating, the formula is really very dry, and the coverage lighter than I anticipated from this brand.  Not suited for dry skin areas, but the dryer formula does help it wear long.  The color is very very very warm ( and my skin is warm undertoned).  Too warm for me.  Also, too warm to be suitable for use as a contouring/highlighting concealer.	1
I've always had trouble with standard foundations finding my perfect shade of brown. Especially during the summer when i tan, i was really skeptical trying Dermablend, but fell in love instantly with their liquid foundation. Like a lot of women on occasion i need a good concealer so I decided to try their "quick fix". This concealer is solid and will hide your imperfections even some basic tattoos . When applied with the foundation it  will leave your skin looking smooth and flawless.  You don't need much to achieve your perfect look and really leaves your skin looking almost pore-less and doll like. Overall for all of us brown skin girls, this is the color and cover we've been searching for.  I would definitely give it a try, it's worth the extra $$ for the quality.	1
If you like a lipstick-style concealer rather than the type that comes with a little applicator, this one is quite nice.  It goes on smoothly and seems to last quite awhile.  The coverage is good.  I prefer to use my finger to apply this rather than use the stick directly onto my skin.  It seems like I have more control that way.  This concealer hasn't caked when I use it, although perhaps it could if you try to use too much in one place.  The color is a little darker than I expected, but that is not uncommon with online ordering and with the variations in monitor and screen display colors.  To me, the SPF doesn't really add much to the product because you are not going to want to use a sunscreen only where you use this concealer; you'll want to use it on your whole face.	1
I use the Dermablend Quick-Fix Concealer Stick to cover the dark areas under my tired eyes and the occasional zit. It's easy to use. Just dab the stick directly on the spot you want to conceal. I blend it in with my fingertip. It goes on so smooth and blends easily. It provides good coverage without looking thick or cracky. You can layer it for more coverage. Even in the sweaty hot days this summer, I don't have to touch it up during the day.	1
I've used two different colors of Dermablend's Quick-Fix concealer and found both to have nice coverage and both were easy to apply. Both colors matched my expectations based on the names. I'm happy with this.	1
This concealer has nice coverage and was easy to apply. Only one application was necessary. Color was true to expectations.	1
Good coverage and doesn't cake up on your face. I have a large scar on the side of my face so I need full coverage.  I recently learned you should put on your concealer after your foundation and I tried it and it blended really well.  RECOMMENDED.	1
I have gotten a bit more sun than normal this year even though I have light skin. Ivory works well in winter, slowly moved to light and natural as summer progresses. The caramel is the darkest I can go on my face. I have been blending it with lighter concealer, it gives me a sun kissed look if I apply long the top of my nose and cheekbones. I like the SPF factor. The Dermablend line is been a great product for me, it is easy to apply, I can wear it all day without it falling or becoming cakey. Works great on other parts of the body, I use it to cover sunspots on my hands.	1
I have issues sometimes with dark half circles under my eyes.  I tried this in the natural for when I am tanner and found it to be very effective in diffusing the darkness of that area, as well as hiding any spots.  I set it with Bare Minerals powder and I am good for the day.  I reapply lightly at night if going out.  I use the light color for no tan and the natural for when I have a tan.  Here is the brand pitch and I agree!  "Powerful Makeup for All. Dermatologist created. High-performance pigments, fragrance-free, allergy-tested, sensitive skin tested, non-comedogenic."	1

as an 84 year old guy, I find this, though it's a woman's product, useful for treating the old age spots on my face.  Definitely recommended.	1
This is the best concealer I have ever used. I've tried a bunch of the Dermablend products and was thrilled when this color actually matched my skin. I don't consider my skin tone light, but all the other more "average" shades have been way too dark in this brand. I have a BUNCH of concealers and I've never had one work this well and blend in to my skin so seamlessly.  Dermablend makes great stuff if you need coverage.	1
This concealer does a great job covering imperfections. I have light, sensitive skin. This concealer did not irritate my skin and did a nice job covering up a blemish, a scar on my chin, and my dark under eye circles. It is a thick product, a little goes a long way. I dabbed it on and used a beauty blender to blend it out for a natural look. After I set it with powder it lasted all day. The product is a bit pricey but since a little goes along way, I think it will last for a long time.	1
Hands down my favorite concealer. SPF 30 that's way cool!! I don't wear make up I say, and with this that's true - I believe anyway lol. I mean its sun block right? I don't actually burn but I look like I do, my face and neck are always red regardless of sun exposure. SO I use "just a little" color to reduce the appearance. I'm a guy so  - no purse, I carry this in my pocket. Someday someone's gonna see it and say "You" wear make up. I will say NO I wear a tinted sun screen. And it will be true , shewhhh, dodge that one. This stuff covers great and last all day. Never gets on my collar and is still in place at the end of the day. Totally covers my red while protecting my skin. I'm a lifetime user unless my redness someday goes away but I don't see that happening. So dedicated customer here.	1
Dermablend Quick-fix Concealer stick is concealer packaged the old fashioned way - stick!  You can wear it on bare skin, under or even over foundation.  Just pat on your skin to cover blemishes or scars, and then set with powder.  This works great for covering up dark circles under your eyes, too.  This product is not dry or flaky and doesn't get stuck in my wrinkles.  It offers coverage and blends well.  It easily fits into my simple beauty routine and I love it!	1
The LOreal Dermablend Professional line of cosmetics is new to me.  They earn being in a high-end category in my opinion. They do not seem to be scented or too chemical. The jars, tubes, compacts are made very sturdy to last along with your make-ups. I have many favorites among them, yet I believe they all stand very well on their own.  I hope it is going to be efficient to review all of the ones I know of here, and including compatible products along the way. Respectively:  1. L'OREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL COVER CRME WITH TITANIUM DIOXIDE SUNSCREEN (30SPF): 2. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL TRANSLUCENT LOOSE SETTING POWDER (NO SPF): 3. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SET + REFRESH LONG-LASTING MAKE-UP SETTING SPRAY (NO SPF): 4. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SMOOTH LIQUID CAMO MEDIUM COVER FOUNDATION (25 SPF): 5. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL INTENSE POWDERCAMO (NO SPF): 6. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL QUICK-FIX BODY (NO SPF): 7. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL LEG AND BODY MAKE-UP (SPF25): 8. LOREAL DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX CONCEALER STICK (SPF 30)  I have been using LOreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick I liked and I later sought out.  It smelled good too. It was a truer color in my eyes, since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such.  Also, some of the LOreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly, and I liked them because they looked very ethereal, as with the pink-violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light.  I have aged, and my last purchase was a LOreal Infallible product, one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips. I have been so obsessed that I have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone. I have a lot of products from their Visible Lift line for my skin texture. I especially enjoyed the Blur ones.  Now I am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag.  There has been more exposure with LOreal in my experience than I can mention here, including most recently, a lovely reddish-brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put, a super-mascara, another lip paint, some face-tone enhancers, and a creamy-to-dry, light-colored eye light, among others.  I am happy to see more high-end products from LOreal that should work well for young and old alike, especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd.  1. DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL COVER CRME WITH TITANIUM DIOXIDE SUNSCREEN (30SPF): This is the first item in this line of Dermablend cosmetics from LOreal that Ive received, and it is my very favorite.  It covers my skin imperfections well.  My first attempt with it doesnt count, since I spread it very thin, allowing a bit of dermatitis I had at the time to show some dry skin through.  And I went out that night wondering why this was happening.  First of all, I thought I needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product, and second, I thought I needed to exfoliate since I have sun spots. Now I get it.  This particular crme has to be built up gradually for me. And building it up judiciously is not problematic at all.  It is lovely.  If I use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover variable imperfections; and when I apply it with dab it appears blended, and I really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make-up can be.  It has alone a bit of chroma to it, as does Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF),  in my opinion, unlike many other cover products I have used. Alone, they gleaming the light more than my other cover make-ups, without chalkiness.  Very nice.  The other purpose for me is that it has a (30 SPF) sunscreen.  ALL other cosmetics with sunscreen I have tried have (25 SPF) or lower, and not my needed (30 SPF) that my dermatologist recommends.  She has said that even in my home with shades closed I am exposing my skin to potential damage.  I score 1,000 % here for this as well as the other qualities of this line.  The two colors I have are both medium ones, one a bit lighter, and both appropriate for me, especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored LOreal Dermablend Pro products with them.  Ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many LOreal Dermablend Pro products listed here. And I realize you may not have this type of a menu, but I am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else.  2. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL TRANSLUCENT LOOSE SETTING POWDER (NO SPF): needed. The wonderful crmes I love work nicely with Loreal Dermablend Professional Translucent Loose Setting Powder with micronized powder, and hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for.  This particular product is very fine, not grainy, and perhaps a bit creamy.  It definitely blends in well.  It is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier, keeping the crme, bases, foundations, from smudging to hands, clothing.  In various ways, I am able to get some creative looks I sought in using them together:   Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder in my three separate medium shades (separate jars); when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as I so chose. A. What I mean is that with the lighter shade of crme I was able to get the same look with the darker powder, as with the opposite of that technique using the darker crme and a lighter powder. Altogether, with these medium shades I was able to get a perfect match, thus prolonging my experience.  B. Also, with the white translucent powder I have found that I am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face, and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, I will carefully apply and lightly dust the medium-toned translucent powders as described, allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion.  Another plus 1,000 for me.  I have found recently that I need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself. Pick your poison, as I have purchased some powder and crme blushes before today; though you may find it unnecessary if you want the dimensional yet minimalist look.  I like to play with the powders, yet, when I am in a rush I will make errors, not being subtle, and not dusting before other products.  Also, I am 62, and my baggy under-eye application errors are the most noticeable. I get rid of this bagginess first.  I will use the powders now, especially with other lighter Dermablend crme applications, or with the high-quality Dermablend Pro Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Cover Foundation (25 SPF) listed below; and as well as their other foundations. All definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts. One thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. The powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type, for example; they are nice for a youthful complexion; and I believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less-noticeable pores, and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined.  In my case I am fine, and safest when I am well-rested.  3. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SET + REFRESH LONG-LASTING MAKE-UP SETTING SPRAY (NO SPF): These Dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray. Just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make-up applications.  Even with dusted powders it will make a difference.  It is that simple.  4. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL SMOOTH LIQUID CAMO MEDIUM COVER FOUNDATION!! (25 SPF): This a product that I had underestimated until today when I applied it under Dermablend Pro Translucent Loose Setting Powder, which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look; yet because I preferred the variable built-up applications I achieved with the Dermablend Professional Crme, I missed something with trying this last.  As before I was too quick to judge.  I had applied it very thick and then I went out.  I thought to myself that is was mask-like, yet nice moist cover.  Not only can I variably apply this creamier product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers, I can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look, then applying more product to the flaws. This shade is a tad darker than the other shades of make-ups, so as with the crme, and the powders, I may experiment with altering the look as in 2A.  Win-Win-Win.  I also may add a finishing touch of the Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray for a fresh stay; with or without powders.  5. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL INTENSE POWDERCAMO!! (NO SPF): This is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator, in other compartments.  While this color is quite dark for me, one quality, besides the products ability to render a thin cover layer, is that I do not see wrinkles really.  Maybe the thin layer or the creaminess?  And the staying power, especially with the fresh mist of Loreal Dermablend Professional Set + Refresh Long-Lasting Make-Up Setting Spray.  Also, I can dab and smooth this powder wherever I want to whatever area of the face or neck.  The darker color, applied gently is making a nice bronzer.  I do know that is stretching it. I haven't tried it over the above LOreal Dermablend Professional liquid Camo product, since this is a very dark color; however, I am sure this might possibly work; though this does go on thin, and I do not think a crme or foundation is needed to get a good look. Very nice camo cover product!  6. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL QUICK-FIX BODY!! (NO SPF): Wow again.  I hadnt understood at first how I can use this, as one of the colors I own is a darker bronze; and while I hadnt yet noticed the medium (my shade).  I mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me, yet thick as I applied it - and silly me! I am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash I have!  Double win!  This is a creamy roll-up stick cover product which does the job, and which I won't feel shy about adding puffs of Dermablend Professional translucent setting powder so it doesnt rub off; and I will use the appropriate color powder as well as described above in 2A.  This is a lovely product.  I love the idea of having a smooth body-skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful, and long-lasting Dermablend Professional Leg and Body Make-Up; however, Im mentioning this first as Im partial to a more natural, yet youthful, less unsightly look.  It isn't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed as the full body make-up, yet it is the product I will use first; especially during the day. Love.  7. LOREAL DERMABLEND PROFESSIONAL LEG AND BODY MAKE-UP (SPF25): It is so nice to wear tights, stockings, or nylons during the Winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses, and on ankles under pants above boots.  However, during cooler months especially, it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing.  Not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look, it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing.  I absolutely loved the look when I put it on; and then darn, I was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin.  This might not be problematic for you with full-body applications, as for me on an occasional basis as desired; yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother, and will please you I believe.  As I have expressed that this product renders a nice, airbrushed look, and I believe even because of the staying power alone this Dermablend Pro product is worth looking into.  8. LOREAL DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX CONCEALER STICK (SPF 30) This works fabulously; it is creamy and it stays put; it is smart just as the LOreal Dermablend Professional Cover Crme, because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends, even as I am in my home, shades drawn.  It covers very well, looks flawless with or without other products, yet it works synergistically with the wonderful LOreal Dermablend Pro line. I have it in a tan color, and I would have thought since I usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin. Lovely. Plus 1,000, and very smart.  Very nice products indeed.  Enjoy!  The LOreal Dermablend Professional line of cosmetics is new to me.  They earn being in a high-end category in my opinion. They do not seem to be scented or too chemical. The jars, tubes, compacts are made very sturdy to last along with your make-ups.

This is a review for the Dermablend Quick-fix Concealer for Full Coverage  Stick in three shades:  10C Natural 30C Light and 10N Ivory  If you've never tried Dermablend makeup before, know that it's a really quality brand but it is normally made for full coverage - it is heavier makeup meant to really conceal and hide flaws and blemishes and it's not  like a a B&B cream which is my usually choice.  I've had an autoimmune condition for many years that has given me telangiectasis on my upper chest and face (usually referred to as broken blood vessels.) I usually hate the feel of heavy foundations and concealers but if I go out somewhere like a party or where I am going to have my picture taken, I prefer to have them covered up.   Dermablend has really been a great answer for my issues, and it has been recommended by dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons for years as one of the few (if only) makeups that can cover blue/yellow/red bruises and real discolorations  - not just the occasional blemish,  I have used their foundations before and reviewed those separately, but am now reviewing these three quick-fix sticks. And, I said in my Dermablend foundation review, it is just so hard to pick out any makeup - especially a foundation or a concealer - without actually going in person and trying it on to see if it blends with your face.  Saying that, I can review the quality of the makeup. In this case, I found these concealer sticks good, albeit you have to use a little more than I'd like to cover up the discoloration; one quick swipe of the stick didn't do it.  Personally, I use a little bit of the stick and then use one of their powders over it and that really helps correct the problem.  My particular coloring is rather pale with sort of an olive tone - I have dark hair and light skin. I thought the best stick for me of the three was the lightest, the Ivory, which surprised me. The other two sticks weren't bad but Light 30C had a tiny bit too much pinkish for me, and the 10N just a tad too yellow.  Again, the trick is to find the right color, and I think that's really hard to do online. I do recommend the Dermablend makeup brand if you're looking for makeup that really covers. Do be careful if you have older skin; the heavier concealers and makeup can add years even if they do cover up discolorations so take that into consideration too.	1
**UPDATE 12/19/2017 - Now that its winter i am noticing that this conceler is drying my skin out. I tried mixing it with face oils and using richer moisturizer before etc but i am still noticing the dry patches. Docking a star down.**  Its awesome!! Its true to color and its pigmented so a little goes a long way. I have some dark circles and this helps cover it pretty well. I cannot say that is true for many of the name brand concealers I've tried over the years. This product has humbled many!!  I simply moisturize my face, glide the concealer under the eye and blend it with my fingers or a wet beauty blender and use a foundation after. It does make a huge difference. It is also economically prized.  I love it and would recommend this to everyone!	1

Overall this is a very good concealer.  It does blend in slightly lighter than I expected.  The tan - to  me - goes on almost like a lighter shade, say ivory.  It does cover decently, including dark circles under eyes, although I think if it had slightly more pigment it would work a bit better.  The skin tone in my family is fair so I assumed the lightest shade would be best but we will buy Medium next time and see how that goes.  I don't fault DermaBlend for that, and while not a huge fan of their products this one is good.  I usually find their stuff overpriced and requiring too many steps - drying, setting powder etc.  Application is simple, Treat it somewhat like a lipstick and dab or stroke it gently onto your skin.  All in all a good concealer once you find the right shade.	1
I think this is a good concealer, but it wasn't what I was wanting. I ordered this for my teenage daughter. She just wanted a product to cover the occasional blemish. The consistency is smooth and blendable, but it is a little heavier than what my daughter needed. It was difficult to get a light covering. I think this would be better for larger areas needing to be concealed. The color was a good match. The product stays in place and doesn't sweat off, yet it is easy to wash off at the end of the day.	1
Excellent coverage.  It's waterproof. Doesn't smug once it's set.  Just remember to go lightly and build thin layers blending till you have covered and concealed. Applying thin layers and allow each layer to set. You will be rewarded.  Worth the price. Highly recommend.	1
This is my first Dermablend product and I am pleased with the results.  Reading the reviews for other products from this company, I was afraid that this quick-fix concealer would feel heavy and be difficult to wash off.  That was not the case. The concealer glides on smoothly and stays in place for most of the day.  It washed off with the rest of my make-up....trouble free.  I used the ivory color which blended in perfectly underneath my eyes for a quick fix.  I also blended in a small amount on a particularly nasty varicose vein on my leg and it did appear to mute the colors.  I do not know if this is one of the specific uses of this particular product...but I gave it a try.  I would recommend this product.	1
This is my favorite beauty product that I've used for years. I have used under my eyes, and over a small scar. It never appears heavy or greasy. Stays on all day, gotta love that. I've tried other products and have not found anything that I felt gave me enough coverage.	1
Perfect for covering up the circles under your eyes. This gives a generous amount of coverage, getting rid of the darkness easily. The coverage goes on smooth without need for a ton of blending. Keep in mind to go a little bit lighter if you're using it under your eyes. Highlights the area so you don't look dead and the same color everywhere. I like the nice dewey look it leaves behind. It does not appear to be dry or cakey. Love it	1
I am a huge Dermablend fan.  Having struggled with blemishes my whole life, and still buying acne stuff though I'm now on Medicare, I know my cover-ups and concealers, and for my money, there is no better line than Dermablend.  So many concealers fail to conceal.  So many don't adhere if one's skin is even slightly oily.  So many disappear as soon as one's skin gets moist.  None of these things is true of this concealer.  It covers red places and other discoloration completely, regardless of how moist and/or oily your skin is, and it stays there, continuing to conceal for hours.  I usually use a light powder over my foundations and concealers, so that may help it have staying power, but I don't doubt it would be long-lasting even without the powder.  Five stars.	1
This is a nice, easy, quick concealer.  The lip stick container makes this concealer easy to apply.  Conceals spots very nicely.  The only problem we have is it is much darker than we expected.  The item shipped is a DEEP 80W.  Would definitely need something lighter if we were to use it all the time.  No irritation.  Goes on smooth.	1
I really like this product.  The stick makes it easy and fast to apply, and it really stays in place.  The coverage is pretty opaque, but that's what makes it great for covering up things you want to conceal.  Finding the correct color online was a bit tricky, but the color I chose works well with my fair skin.	1
This concealer really hides blemishes and dark spot more than just under the eye. Just a light swipe or dot to cover the area and blend your imperfections away. 4 stars because it feels pretty heavy, more like a theatre makeup and I don't know if my skin could stand to wear it every day. And a little goes a long way, I mean a tiny bit. I was a little heavy handed the first time I used it and I felt more time blending than anything else. It's really good for super stubborn spots but wouldn't recommend it for every day use	1
I'm new to using concealers because they always seemed too make-upy.  But sometimes....  Now these sticks are easy to carry with me in my bag, and go on easily, blend easily and i actually forgot I had it on.  That is about as good as you can ask for something like this!	1
I have found it hard to find a shade that matches my skin-tone well; the darker shades are too dark and the lighter shades are too pale/chalky.  Others may have better luck getting a good match; I couldn't do it.  And by my lights, this is a fatal flaw in a concealer, no matter how high quality it is.	-1
Finding the perfect concealer to mask dark undereye circles is something like the quest for the Holy Grail.  In my experience, covering discrete dark areas (like a blemish or a tattoo) is relatively easy, while it's extremely difficult to achieve a natural look concealing the amorphous area under the eye.  Over the  years, I've tried professional cover-up in pots (Limelight by Alcone), drugstore brands with sponge applicators (Cover Girl Invisible Concealer) and department store brands in tubes (Clinique Advance Concealer) with about the same results.  Lately, I've been using Bare Minerals Correcting Concealer Light 1, which comes in a small pot and must be applied with a fingertip.  It works well enough, but application is a bit of a pain and the color does not quite match my fair sallow skintone.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the Dermablend Quick-Fix (in Shade 30C - Light) because it's densely pigmented, super easy to apply, blends seamlessly and doesn't settle into the creases.  The color has a slight yellow/neutral undertone that matches my skin perfectly and doesn't create that dreaded overly white "reverse raccoon" eye.  I really like the stick applicator which is sized and shaped perfectly for the undereye area.  One thing I should add, if you don't set with powder (which I avoid because I'm over 50), you'll need to re-apply midday, but other than that, this really is a wonderful product.	1
This was pretty disappointing. I've had luck with similar products so I was certain that it would cover up a small birthmark. It might work well under your eyes, but it did not offer enough coverage for the birthmark. I applied it correctly, even trying different techniques such as stippling, using a little, using a lot, reapplying. Nothing worked. That pesky little oversized freckle was still staring at me.	-1
I have used DermaBlend for years. I like the thorough coverage and a little application goes a long way. Just a touch on a problem area provides lots of cover-up. I blend with my foundation and add powder to balance the color. Powder also mattes the shine. If you want good coverage by using a little product, this is a budget-friendly concealer that is also portable. The lipstick style packaging makes this easy to carry for needed touch-ups. I will continue to use DermaBlend for years to come.	1
I used this to conceal my dark circles under my eyes and it covers them very well.  The only time I need to reapply is if/when I rub the makeup off with my finger and sometimes that happens if I get an itch or something.  But otherwise, it stays on all day without reapplication.  If you have crinkles the makeup might settle into them.  I have tiny crinkles near my nose and I have to just touch the make-up area a little bit to smooth it out but I've had to do that with all the other concealers I've used.  Also, this is moisturizing and I don't feel the need to use lotion afterwards.  I do put a good, non-greasy moisturizer underneath my eyes before applying any concealer. I like that it has SPF 30 especially for makeup that I use on my face.	1
This is a great SPF 300 concealer. Great coverage, lasts long. This color is a bit darker than it looks in the picture. Great for highlighting too!	1
If you have any type of facial scarring this product is excellent. My daughter has some acne scars and she used it under her make up.  This noticeably lessened their appearance. A little goes a long way. She used just a small amount and blended it into her skin. She is fair skinned and this worked great with her complexion. It is thicker than regular makeup but since she used a small amount it did not look cakey at all. This blended easily with her skin.  She used her fingertips but a make up sponge will do the trick beautifully too.	1
This concealer is very creamy and a little goes a long way for me.  I would say this worked well for a full-coverage spot concealer. It did nice on my under eyes.  I do not have any blemishes on my skin so I cannot say how well that would hide that imperfection but I would guess very good.  After setting this with powder it lasted most of the day and I did not have to reapply.  Deramablend is considered a prestige beauty brand and you can find in some of your favorite beauty stores.  Overall, nicely done.	1
Not bad, blends better than most and actually did last throughout the day. Below I have applied the concealer to the eye on the left and the eye on the right is bare. (Yes, I know I have some of the worse dark eye circles out there.) I also had no reaction to it allergy-wise.	1
This is a great concealer stick. I have a dime size discoloration on my face (next to my right eye) and this concealer stick does a wonderful job of hiding it. I use this under my foundation and it all blends together nicely. I have no complaints, it lasts me until I wash it off and it is super easy to apply. Another great product from Dermablend!	1
Along with the perfect shade of Dermablend cover creme (warm beige), this Quick Fix Concealer Stick is probably my favorite new makeup product by Dermablend that I've tried so far--and I've tried several items over the past few weeks.  First, the lipstick style tube makes it extremely easy to apply the concealer  but don't press too hard or you may get more than you bargained for. That said, even this light shade covers well, but perhaps too well  my spouse said it looked like I had a black eye. On the other hand, I received a compliment at work, and I thought I looked good, so maybe it just needed to sink in.  I used it specifically to hide my purple tone under my eyes and my reddish nose, but if I find myself with any acne in the future this will be the first item I grab. This turned out great for me and it's easily recommended.	1
I've used many concealers to cover my dark circles over the years.  When I opened the easy-to-use lipstick type tube, I was more than surprised to see a brown concealer. Brown?  I have fair skin and no way did it work for me.  I tried it on some spots and it emphasized the area.  It also did not go on smoothly.  I then tried to apply a foundation over it, and the area still had a very dark color.  I would give it one star, but maybe if I had a lighter color, it would be beneficial.  I've actually not seen any concealer this dark, but I assume it works for some skin types.	-1
I didn't realize when I request this that it is an old-school waxy concealer. I don't have much luck with those because the mineral oil and wax always cause my lower lash liner and mascara to smear during the day.  This is quite pigmented and will readily cover discolorations. The texture of the stick is a little soft at room temp; that makes it easy to apply without tugging but I would be hesitant to carry it with me on a hot day.  My skin tone is light to medium beige and I found the Natural 10C to be too pale	-1
This quick fix applies on smoothly and easily. I have a keloid spot on my back and sometimes I just hate for it to show... :(  Since it was hard for me to apply, because of its location, I had my husband to do it... well as you can see by the photos, once blended properly, and not by your spouse lol, that it will work as a good mask... the spot I was trying to cover isn't flat and kind of feels like a bump so that's why the makeup may look caked... it doesn't cake at all, I think this was more so about how it was applied and where.  I tried this on my arm and I actually lost the spot I tried it on because it blended so well. I recommend this. I wouldn't put it on a keloid spot though... I don't think it would blend as flawlessly as I could/would somewhere else... smoother.	1
Meh.  This lipstick-like tube is convenient to carry, but the Derma-blend quick-fix concealer goes on very thicky and the texture is thick and cakey.  Blending is essential.  After trying this, I think I'll stick to lighter, more fluid concealers.  35C Medium color is more pink in hue than I expected (compared to my usual reference of Bare Minerals' Medium Beige).	-1
I naturally have dark circles under my eyes even though I could have had 9 hours of sleep... genetically, I have dark circles so I actively look for a concealer that has nice coverage for this area that withstands all day in a humid environment. Dear god I am loving this. It goes on so light and smooth. I'm surprised at how easily this blended onto my skin and decreased the dark circles and redness. This product blended like a thicker foundation and had a nice coverage without caking. I'm happy with the product. Gives great coverage with just a small dab. No strong scent. Looks very natural.	1
This is a very nice concealer. The deep color appears to be a bit darker than I thought. Nevertheless, It blends very well and does a great job of covering spots and blemishes, especially in the under eye area where it doesn't look cakey or heavy. The coverage is excellent. It is natural looking and long-lasting as well. I like that it dispenses like a mini lipstick, goes on buttery smooth and easy to blend. Great product.	1
This is an outstanding product.  It is easy to apply and does not need reapplying during the day.  It handles the dark circles I have under my eyes very effectively.  Makes me look younger because it covers them up. Choose your color carefully.  The caramel was too dark for me, the natural was just right. This product also hides tattoos that you don't want to show perhaps during the day at work.	1
The color is a little lighter than expected, but I love this concealer. It goes on smoothly and it stays put all day. The coverage is well. I've been using it with Dermablend's blurring foundation (in Spice, which is a perfect match to my skin tone). This has been my first experience with Dermablend products, and I'm definitely making a switch going forward to this brand.	1
Everyone needs a cover stick at some time in their life.  I have always used cover sticks to hide smallish imperfections.  I love cover sticks that smooth on easily and really hide those annoying little flaws.  This one does the job beautifully.  It smooths on easily and is almost invisible.  The color is perfect...I lucked out with that.  You really just need a little dab and some expert finger smoothing and you are set to go!	1
I'm very disappointed with this, after using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dermablend-Professional-Cover-Creme-1-oz-Chroma-2-1-8-Natural-Beige/dp/B0017MWW56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dermablend Professional Cover Creme 1 oz. Chroma 2-1/8 Natural Beige</a>&nbsp;I wanted to try this since I really liked the cover creme. I got 2 shades, a lighter and a darker. I get fairly pale in the winter but super dark in the summer. If you want to conceal spots, moles, freckles, I highly recommend the cover creme instead of this. It did not blend anywhere near as well as the creme.	-1
Goes on a little thick. Color seems a bit darker than it did in the picture online. Note that the color brown is not a good fit for an Indian skin tone. It would work if you are into contouring, however. Four stars.	1
The 'light' concealer stick works well for dark under-eye circles. It's not much lighter than the 'tan' concealer stick.  I've found that after I apply it, it works best for me if I just blend the edges so it blends in with my foundation, because if I try to smooth over all of it, it disappears.  It has a nice feel to it and is easy to apply.	1
Works very well. The color is a little off, but if I blend it in with a fingertip, it works.	1
This concealer does have some amazing coverage. It goes on pretty thick and you're not going to be able to see much through it. For skin color/tone correction this works well. For blemishes, it's a bit cakey.  I like this for areas like under my eyes, around the nose and a little on my chin. It evens out skin's color very well. If you're looking for a thick concealer that will completely cover things like dark circles or red areas, this will do it.	1
I have dark circles from year round allergies.  I have tried many different types of concealer. This product goes on easily and covers well. It cakes around wrinkles a little, but it still is better than most products. It hasn't made me break out yet either.  Overall, I am happy with the product. I have included a picture of me wearing the concealer only, no eye makeup.	1
This is easily one of the best concealers that I have used. It blends very well and does an excellent job of covering spots and blemishes on my face, especially in the under eye area where it doesn't look cakey or heavy like some concealers do. The coverage is excellent. It is natural looking and long-lasting as well. I like that it dispenses like a mini lipstick, goes on buttery smooth and easy to blend. Excellent product. Love it!	1
The Dermablend Concealer Stick is the concealer makeup stick that I need to cover a birthmark, large pores and circles under my eyes. It goes on smooth and does an excellent job of covering blemishes.  It also is a sunscreen with a SPF 30. I just spread it on the spots with my finger and blend it on my face.	1
got this one to use under my eye area. Helps brighten and conceal what I wanna cover up. I like that it is easy to use kinda like a tube of lip stick. Easy to apply, lasts all day.  Easy to store too does not take up a ton of room. over all really like also no skin irritation for me.	1
Color is great, covered my under eye bags really well. It is a bit thick but blends well. I like that it has SPF 30 already in the product. Caused no irritation and doesn't have any smell. It conceals well but rubs off easily. I like the product but I don't think it's any better than some of the drugstore products I've used that cost much less.	1
Except for my young neice that thought this was lipstick (yes, the product was in that type of container) this has been a relativity smooth applicator. Basically twist it like lipstick and apply. I need to smooth it in with my fingers but it seems to last most of the day.	1
I like this a lot. The coverage is good and it stays. The feel is moist, but not thick or oily, and not powdery, so you don't have to worry about accentuating facial lines. It has 30 spf, which is great for my nose and the area around it, which burns very easily and has sun damage that I need to cover up (broken veins). Choosing your color is probably the biggest challenge, because it's not an inexpensive product. I use Cover Girl CGSmoothers Classic Ivory most of the year. This product in Light is noticeably darker than that without being actually dark, which makes it good for my fair skin in summer, when I get a slight tan/burn. Still, it is a bit dark, so if you're going to use it to cover a large area and you have very fair skin, choose a lighter shade. I'm a natural brunette, and Light is a tiny bit too dark for me, but usable in small amounts. This product contains talc, which has mixed reviews.  Edited to add: I also received the product in Ivory, for review. The ivory color is lighter than the Light, and comparable to the CGSmoothers Classic Ivory, but with better coverage. The first two ingredients of both colors are mineral oil and talc.	1
This is my first time to use Dermablend products and I love how creamy this is.  It is so easy to blend for a concealer. The company says that it's not cakey and masky and that is definitely true.  Because it is so easy to blend you don't end up with that caked on look which can ultimately make you look older because it settles into the fine lines.  I had no issue with that.  It's not super thick coverage so if you have dark blemishes I'm not sure this is the right choice but the coverage is very good,  I love the applicator which makes it super easy to apply.  Because it is so easy to blend, you can put this right on from the container and rub in with your fingers.  That makes this a good "on the go" product.  I look forward to using this daily and will update with any changes after using it a while. I'm used to a little thicker blend from another brand I use but that one does settle in my lines, unlike this one.	1
It's great except for the $26 price. This 30 SPF concealer stick does the job at hiding blemishes. So if that's what you want it for, then you will be happy, as long as you don't mind the price.  It's waterproof just in the same way that most sunscreen is waterproof: in other words, the more time you spend in the water, the less waterproof it becomes.  The light to dark range is IVORY-LIGHT-NATURAL-BEIGE-TAN-CARAMEL-BRONZE-BROWN-DEEP	1
I have always wanted to try these products so was excited to get this opportunity through Vine. I've often wanted to cover a big shaving cut when I have to attend a summer wedding, or some other similar issue. This does the job. I plan to use it for such situations, although based on usage it seems that it would work very well on scars and discolorations or other issues people may want to cover from time to time. Great stayign power.	1
The concealer provides good coverage. It hides scars and even beauty marks. It don't cover up pimples or dimples very well though, it works best on "flat" skin imperfections. Once it's set with powder, it lasts the entire day without smudging or transferring to my clothes. I'm not happy with the color selection. I use foundation from the same brand and they have "50 Shades of Tan". And not so many here. I suggest ordering a sample pack from their website and trying it out, especially if you think you're in between shades.	1
This concealer is easy to use. It goes on smooth, provides good coverage, and looks natural. I use it on age spots and wrinkles. It blends in and looks nice. This is a good product.  In some ways the cream concealer stick is more convenient than the liquid concealer. It never spills, there is no brush to get gunky, it comes in a small container you can carry in your purse, and it lasts a long time.  The case is sophisticated looking and it makes you feel elegant.	1
Dermablend Quick Fix Concealer is a very smooth silky feeling product that glides on with no dry feeling, no pulling of undereye skin, no pilling, and no distortion in color. It goes on evenly and stays throughout the day on the face. I don't know how well it would wear on other areas if one were to sweat.  The tube is handy to toss in your purse or leave on the bathroom countertop. It looks like a thin lipstick tube although a little longer. The product comes out of the tube the same way a lipstick comes out - by turning the bottom until you have a small amount out. It's easy to apply either directly or by applying with clean fingers.  This is a good concealer. It does very well at hiding dark circles as well as skin that's slightly pigmented, or dark spots. I recommend this concealer to anyone looking for something smooth and velvety that's not at all drying, doesn't irritate, and is true to the color on the Amazon chart.	1
This is one concealer that is worthy of its name. It takes very little to conceal anything from sunspots to bruising often seen in the elderly as their skin ages. Do be careful to snap the lid in place, though. This concealer is very smooth and moist and   I suspect   would lose much of its efficacy if it dried out. And the cap is by no means a natural snap  on.	1
This Dermablend concealer does a great job evening out my skin tone. Using the Ivory 10N lightens the shade under my eyes. I currently am using it with my other brand Light shade coverage because I have gotten more sun than normal this year and Light is a closer match than Ivory currently yet I am very pale during winter. The two blend together well and look very natural. I am also using the Dermablend blurring mousse foundation. This product is fantastic in covering redness, age spots, and blue veins. I love that it has a built in SPF 25 that is Titanium Dioxide based. I always test color on the back of my hands because the skin is similar to your face. I found this made the skin on my hands look so nice that I been wearing it there to. The tops of my hands look good and have that SPF protection. It does stay on all day and comes off easily, I use a micellar cleansing water.  I really like this line of product.	1
This is a Godsend if you have scars or other dermal imperfections you want to conceal.  I have a surgical scar on my  knee and this is by far and away the best product I have EVER used to hide that scar.  This product is a well known and well trusted and well established name in skin care products and I was just delighted when this became available to me.  I admit I am surprised that others did not have a good experience with it, but I chalk it up to everybody's needs are different and I am among the lucky percentage for whom this product worked well.  I love this product just for the scar concealer that it is.  I can't thank the manufacturers enough for creating such a helpful product that is very easy to put on and discreet enough to carry in your bag.	1
If you are in search of a product to even out your skin tone and cover marks, scars or discolorations -- your search has ended here! I wish I had known about this years ago, because ultimately I would have saved a bundle of money on experimentation. The price should absolutely not be a deterrent, because this is so ultra concentrated that it should last you a long time. Furthermore, the results are just about perfection. I am now a loyal fan of Dermablend, and will also seek out other items in their line!	1
This is by far the best concealer I have used for under my eyes. It goes on smoothly and can be layered when I need extra coverage. It blends easily and lasts all day, even when used on the oily areas of my combination skin. And unlike other concealers, this one does not accentuate my fine lines and crows feet. I know I am supposed to set this with a powder but I am usually too hurried (or lazy) to remember and this still looks great and lasts. I have spent more than I care to admit on other department store concealers and none were worth it to me. When needed, this is great for covering blemishes or other skin imperfections - I have used an older Dermablend product to cover a neck scar for years. Definitely a quality product that delivers as promised...	1
I recently tried DermaBlend's Smooth Liquid Camo Medium Coverage Foundation.  It really made my skin dry but this concealer stick goes on a lot differently & blends really nice.  It's easy to apply & conceals blemishes really well.  I also use it under my eyes for dark circles and it blends really nice.  I'll keep giving it continued use, but as of now, it's one of the best coverage sticks I've used.  Regarding my skin.  I have very dry, sensitive skin.  I'm always looking for a product that will not only go on smooth & make my skin feel moisturized, I'm wary of products that might irritate my skin & so far, I've had great luck with the Dermablend line.  No reaction.  Huge plus.  If you're looking for a concealer, I would hands down recommend you give this a try.  I think it's a great product!	1
Dermablend Quality in ALL Colors  The shade range in the product is amazing. There's something for everyone of all ethnicities the dilemma is finding the proper one for you + adjust for seasonal changes. It has great coverage too.	1
From my daughter: this concealer goes on smooth. I used it under my eyes and it stayed their nicely all day. It didn't have as much coverage as I expected, but it covered just enough for me.	1
My wife wears the makeup: Im a bit of a makeup junkie, and enjoy looking for great new products, especially those that improve the appearance of my skin.  Im late 40s, fair-skinned/dark-haired, normal in terms of skin dryness and use concealer just about every day under my eyes and to cover broken capillaries on my cheeks, etc.  I love this concealer.  It did a great job getting rid of darkness under my eyes, and I set it with my coty airspun powder (inexpensive though fragranced, fine-milled setting powder that competes with the best).  At the end of the day, the product was still doing its job and I did not experience it settling into fine lines, etc. Im not sure what to think about those who didn't care for it  except that everyones skin is slightly different (level of dryness, age, color, sun damage, hyperpigmentation, etc.). I can only say that for me, this is staying top-shelf for sure.	1
I've now tried a few different items by Dermablend but this is hands down my favorite. Past the half century mark, concealer is needed but also tricky because it can emphasize wrinkles and crinkles...this provides nice coverage but doesn't dry out delicate skin or result in that crinkled look. Also, this color is nice...just a slight bit darker than my normal tone, this works well for when I'm sporting a tan and looks quite natural. Very good coverage, non irritating, long lasting. My favorite product from Dermablend to date.	1
My wife uses this for her dark eye circles and claims that it minimizes the "raccoon" look. Like any good concealer, it covers evenly (does not "clump"), even in the hot sun. Speaking of which, this concealer has a sun protection factor (SPF) rating of 30! Amazing. All in all, this is a great concealer that can apparently double as sun protection. Say goodbye to those raccoon eyes!	1
I love this and the color was what I expected. Glides on nicely and doesn't leave lines or become to heavy.  See picture below I thought that would be helpful and give you an idea of the true color.  I will definitely use this.	1
I don't wear makeup on a daily basis, but I do like using concealer or foundation when I have a reason to dress up.  This Dermablend concealer stick does a great job covering up dark circles, pimples, freckles, scars or other imperfections on the face (or on other areas of the body).  I got the "tan" color, which works well with light to medium caucasian skin tones, although it comes in a variety of shades for every skin color.  It goes on thick and has to be blended but it does blend into invisibility.  It's a little greasy, but for my middle aged skin that's a bonus - some products tend to accentuate wrinkles or stand out if they are too dry.  I like the lipstick-type tube that rolls up and down, and I like the amount of product in the tube.  I applied it in the morning and it had staying power until afternoon, when I realized it had worn off.  It's summertime here in NC, and no makeup can stay on all day with the heat and humidity.  This product has SPF 30 in it, so be sure to also apply sunscreen to the rest of your face or you will have tan and not-tan spots after a day in the sun.	1
Okay, I'm amazed at how long this concealer has lasted on my face today.  This was day 1 for me for this brand, and it went on nicely, covering my few age spots, and around my eyes.  I have redness around my eyes caused by years of Glaucoma (drops), plus pronounced darker semi-circles under the eyes.  I patted on the Ivory color (perfect color for my very fair skin) and it actually worked to conceal.  The semi-circles were still there, just not as dark, and the redness was not noticeable, and the age spots/blemishes all but disappeared. I think it has held up rather well, even without the setting powder.  After applying, I put on Dermablend Cover Creme and their Intense Powder Camo, dry, plus some of my blush to finish the look.  My face has looked great all day, and not cakey or looking like it was put on with a trowel!  The best part for me is that this company is part of L'Oreal,the company that makes my favorite makeup products.	1
This is the best concealer I have ever used! I have uneven skin tones, large pores and fine lines. It did an amazing job covering up and even filling pores and lines. My face has never looked better.	1
Great product.  I use these predominantly for two things. First I use it to address the dark circles under my eyes.  What I love about this product is that it lasts and lasts.  I don't have to reapply it during the day because it would have worn off.  This product lasts for the day after I have applied it. Secondly I use it to cover a tattoo I have on my right leg when I don't want it to be seen.  It is a tattoo of my dog's (pug) face.  I paid to have it removed with laser treatments.  What a joke!  It is still mostly there.  I don't want it seen and commented on so I use this to cover it.  It works great for that too.	1
I love this concealer. It goes on so easily and I don't have to pull at my skin to smooth it. It blends well and covers my dark under eye circles in one application. Likely the best concealer I've used. The color is perfect and I look and feel younger when I wear this.	1
I've previously used the Body Concealer for covering a tattoo and a couple of age blemishes (great results).  This Quick-Fix Concealer indicates suitable for facial use including under eye circles.  I used it on a couple of facial age spots, again with excellent results.  Once a day seems to be enough in areas where there is no rubbing or excessive sweating. If you're not really looking for it, you won't know it's there. I didn't use the setting powder, but the box instructions indicate that use of the setting powder will provide coverage lasting up to 16 hours.  This Ivory shade is a bit light for summer use.  I'll save it for those pale winter periods and get a darker shade for summer (with light tanning).  There are a whole gaggle of shades available -- shop for yours. Made in USA. A L'Oral product.	1
I'm not someone who wears makeup often, and I'm extremely pale. This concealer was not only easy to use, it was the perfect match to my skin tone. I used to to lighten the darkness under my eyes (it didn't fully take it away but it definitely lightened it) and to cover up some blemishes. It went on smoothly and I was definitely very happy with it.	1
This is an easy-to-apply concealer, and the color matches my skin tone. My issue is under-eye dark circles. Nothing completely gets rid of them -- I've tried other concealers -- but this does a decent job for me. (I'm in my 60s, so I don't expect any product to give me back the skin I had in my 20s.) I use my finger to put it on, blend it in, then set it by powdering my face. You could also use a small makeup brush to apply it. It's in a lipstick-type tube instead of a bottle with a brush like the other concealers I've used. When the weather is hot -- which it often is in South Texas -- I apply it in the morning and then again in the afternoon or evening if I'm going to be out and about. It has no fragrance. It's not the cheapest product on the market, but it gets the job done.	1
The quickfix concealer is a wonderful product that does everything you expected to do. It even covers tattoos, burn marks, or any other thing you may want to cover up. It doesn't remove until you remove it. It's water resistant which makes it even better.	1
This brand has always been the gold standard for make-up products with superior coverage that can be used to hide everything from scars, tattoos, birthmarks, dark circles and discolorations from age spots to bruises. My skin tone is medium light and the Medium 35C shade is a good match.  The texture is thick but a thin coat still goes on smoothly. After applying I use a cotton swab to feather the edges which with the proper shade selected, makes the transition between the product and skin almost undetectable.  The instructions state that to achieve the longest wear, use a setting powder after application, wait two minutes and brush off the excess. I did not apply powder but even without it the concealer remained in place for easily twelve hours before removed with make-up wipes.  Dermatologist, ophthalmologist and allergy tested, the concealer also does not clog pores, is SPF30 and is unscented. It did not cause irritation, wears well and a light coat does not cake-up. Reliable coverage, very pleased with performance..	1
Love this Dermablend Quick-fix Concealer Stick with SPF 30.  Having SPF 30 is of course a bonus with this concealer. At my age and my level of laziness concealer is about the only makeup I use. I have dark circles under my eyes so I use concealer everyday. This is easy to apply and blends in nicely. The applicator is the size of a lipstick which is great. I am quite impressed with this product.	1
I'm past the half century mark so have a love/hate relationship with concealers. On one hand, I could use it now and then. On the other hand, some brands tend to highlight and exaggerate every little tiny crease. Let's face it, trading circles under the eyes for extra deep wrinkles and crinkles is NOT the desired effect! I've tried a few other brands that work great but cause so much irritation it was a no-go. I've tried brands that claim to be sensitive but don't provide coverage. It's a challenge and one that this brand seems to have more or less mastered. Is it perfect? No, nothing can totally turn back the hands of time but this doesn't worsen it either. Very pleased!	1
Although the color is too dark for me, this is an effective concealer. It applies smoothly and lasts. It does an adequate job of masking minor imperfections. It blends well and the coverage is buildable. I'n addition to be a concealer it serves well as a contour shade. I've found that the latest Dermablend formulations tend to run darker than expected. This one however is pleasingly neutral without the orange and yellow tones. a good concealer but pick your shade with care.	1
Very creamy and easy to apply. Melted right in. I actually used this for under eye discoloration and then used it on a vein on my leg that I wanted disguised.  I used powder on the leg and it stayed on all day and did a good job. I was happy with using it for all my imperfections and red spots, whether they be on my face or wherever.  This product worked very well and it is a great size so I can carry it with me anywhere.	1
Goes on like a Crayola crayon - not super smooth, a bit cakey. Indian folks - the "natural" color is not for you - you will look like a Twilight vampire extra. I wish this brand would upload swatches of colors other than "Ivory" and "Natural". I don't think this is a good brand for the Indian (or any melatonin rich) skin tone. The undertones of this color will make you look ill or ridiculous. For some reason (I'm 37, so this may be why..) this concealer highlights the imperfections in my skin (the wrinkles,..). If you sweat a lot, this concealer will move on you. If you try to put a powder on top to set it, it will cause creases and make you look old. There are better brands than this at this price point, honestly even Boots and Maybelline are better. Two stars.  Update: This product causes irritation to my skin. One star.	-1
Dermablend is my go-to concealer. The formula is creamy and easy to apply. You can use the twist up stick right on your face or apply on your finger first. I also like to apply it with a concealer brush when I 'carve out' my eyebrows and winged liner. The coverage with this product is unreal. I actually heard about it from a doctor who recommended it for covering up surgical scars. It will easily cover up scars, acne, dark circles, and discolorations. It doesn't feel at all heavy or cakey on your face. It will last all day if you use setting powder to finish it. As long as I set it, it does not sink into any fine lines. This is one of the few makeup products I purchase again and again because it is reliable and I haven't found a better option in ANY brand- high or low end.	1
I'm a long time user of Dermablend but this is a new product for me.  I usually stick to liquid concealers; I decided to try this one really because of the name "quick fix."  It's definitely quicker, very easy application, and the coverage is as good as their liquid concealer.  I was worried about the fact that the color choices are fewer than with liquid, but I'm happy with the color.  I got Medium, because even though I am fair complected (red hair, freckles), the "light" colors tend to make me look like reverse racoon eyes because I have so much pink in my skin that it's actually darker than it appears.  This was a good call, so unless you are "translucent" I would seriously consider using medium instead of light for the same reasons.	1
Great Coverage and not drying to my under eyes.  I love it, it stays on great, too.	1
Love it! A new "most important" In my make-up line up!	1
The best under eye concealer, period. Only buy if you really need it, very heavy duty	1
I've only gone through 3 tubes in 4 years and my eyes immediately brighten!  I love this product because it goes on so easy and lasts until I take it off.  It's perfect coverage for under my eyes which are a little saggy and a little purplish in color.  I'm 54 and when I use the Quick Fix my eyes brighten up and I look 10 years younger.  Not cakey or greasy.  I would recommend getting "fitted" for the right color at a department store and then saving money and buying it here.  It's $7 more at Macy's!	1
I love Dermablend. It covers spider veins real well and rosey spots. I have a couple of sun spots on my chest, not large ones but it doesnt do well on those without looking fake. Finding the right shade is really tough. I am fair and their light colors are pinky on my skin and the yellow tones are way too yellow. I use a high end powder from another line and once I get this in the right place I cover then with powder. It does crack if you make it thick. It also looks thick if your skin is oily a while after you put it on. The great thig is it does not irritate or break me out. I rate it highly because of that. This particular tube ( bought two) was a little dried so I may be hesitant to order here again.  It does cover very well, as well as anything I have ever found but not sure about scars or tatoos. I apply a base first and it smooths my pores pretty good too.	1
It used to be even better (creamier and more moist), but it's still the best concealer for me.  I use it after applying moisturizer and primer and it stays on all day and hides most surface flaws.	1
This concealer is awesome, it covers my hereditary dark circles nicely. I have an "in-beween" color that works well year round. It certainly stays put, even in hot weather. The only thing I didn't care for was that it still encourages my mascara to smudge a bit. The old dermablend (in the pot) didn't do that, it kept me from having raccoon eyes. My eyelashes are a bit long on the bottom, so I tend to have that problem with many concealers. I'll be looking for the old version instead (if they still make it), especially to wear in the summer or in humidity in the winter, or will try Ben Nye or Joe Blasco. and use this concealer elsewhere on my face.	1
works great	1
Nothing covers like Dermablend.  I like the new packaging, and its very similar looking to a lipstick tube.  I found the coverage about the same between the old and new, but like the slimmer design, which makes getting into smaller spaces.	1
The best- worth the price, most definitely.	1
I use this on my curly haired daughter. It does a good job of refreshing her curls. It also doesn't have a strong smell.	1
I have been searching for something to help my fine hair have some type of style.  I love this product, it helps my fine straight limp hair. It defines curls, adds shine and makes my hair bouncy.  I hope that they do not change this product. It is the best for what I need, I have very fine hair which curls when I use this product.	1
This is CND's new product.  The product itself is awesome and this color, very nice.  I am lookin forwarding to buying more colors.	1

Last more longer as the nail salon guy said.  And, it does.	1
Denim Patch: Love this formula!!! I was in a rush and only used one coat. Looks amazing IMO & dried soooo fast. Im hooked  Definitely buying more colors	1
This stuff is the worst. It dries super fast, but that's it's one good quality. Has peeled off in large pieces the first day all 3 times I have tried it. I asked myself if this was user error, but after trying multiple times I'm thinking, I am a scientist and this stuff clearly sucks.	-1
The color was shiny-er than I expected, this product however is wonderful and lasts a long time when used with the topcoat. Great alternative to gel polish.	1
The color is absolutely gorgeous!!! Love it!	1
UPDATE: I put this polish on Mon night and a week later there were only some minor chips and tip wear. I just changed it and the removal was easier than Essie, used regular nail polish remover, not the acetone stuff meant for gel nails. Very happy w/this product.  Great, long-lasting polish. I've had it on for 5 1/2 days and, other than slight tip wear, it looks brand new. Does Polish dries insanely fast. Sometimes I'm able to polish two nails before dipping the brush back in, but I had to rush because it was drying out quickly. Topcoat shine did fade a day or two later but next time I'll try adding another coat. The color Svelt Suede is between khaki and taupe. It's light enough that small chips won't show.  I needed 3 coats to get rid of streaks. Rubble is a dark gray, much darker than the blob picture - picture of bottle is true-to-color. It's dark so I only needed 2 coats to get great coverage. Fragrant Freesia does not look peachy in person like it does on the website - it's an opalescent pink. One coat looks translucent, too sparkly for my preference but an acceptable sheer pink for a natural look. I used 2 coats of topcoat because one felt too thin. I almost blew it, DO NOT USE BASECOAT. Putting the polish directly on your nail is what causes the incredible adherence. I have ordered 2 more colors.	1
This is a very nice neutral color. I had it done @ - nail salon so they did 2 coats but I think it could use 3 to even it out	1
This is silver not what's pictured. Waste of money.	-1
I'm a fan of long-lasting Vinylux Polish. When I use it, I generally get close to a week's wear, sometime less, but when I take it to my manicurist, it can last up to 10 days. I really prefer this over shellac because it is so easy to remove at home with inexpensive lacquer polish remover. And my nails are never damaged from it. Just remember that when you use Vinylux Polish, you should also be using the Vinylux topcoat that is part of the system.  This color is really pretty, although a bit shinier than I really like.  Seller shipped quickly and it arrived before the estimated date.	1
A pretty suttle , muave pink !	1
Little more orange/peachy than I expected but still a nice color	1
This is a semi-sheer, needed three coats to get the right coverage.  Beautiful color.	1

didn't realize the color is a semi sheer.  is very pretty, but takes multiple coats to get it opaque.	1

This is my favorite color of the summer! The polish is as expected and stays on well. I received it quickly and recommend the brand and the seller. thanks!	1
I use this for my pedicure ,great perfect match for the Shellac I use on for my manicure	1
This is a wonderful product and lasts longer than a week	1
Best white to do a French manicure ! Stays on tge longest and doesn't turn yellow!	1
Use this product once a week! It takes a few coats, but it dries fast and always looks professional! No need for bottom coat! Love this color. Very good for work and night out!	1
Perfect color and wears long	1
If you are looking for a full coverage you need to apply three coats of this product. It doesn't look nice on my nails. See attached picture of two coats. Looks really bad. I am trying to return this item but it looks like I cannot return it... Really upset and disappointed. I am using CND shellac for over 6 years and love the quality of their product, but not this one. The product has chipped  in 5 days. Normally I am wearing shellac for 3-4 weeks.	-1
My favorite polish. Looks natural... easy to use, dries fast. Worth the price.	1
i love vinylux.  i had been using cnd shellac, but it wrecked my nails when removing it.  this really stays on me for at least a week, and i use my nails like tools (haha).  it's easy to take off and dries very quickly. this particular color is a very pretty lavender color.	1
no better than Sally's no chip polish.	-1
It is blue green with shimmer	1
I don't think this is genuine Vinylux.  I have been using Vinylux since it came out.  I am a huge fan,  and it normally goes on smooth and streak free.  This bottle I received goes on thin and streaky, like it's been thinned out. I have a bottle I got from Ulta that  goes on perfect.  This new bottle is like something from the dollar store.  I won't buy nail polish from Amazon again.  It's worth a few dollars more to get genuine quality.	-1
Love Vinylux.  It is not hard on your nails like gel polish.  Vinylux remover makes  it easy to remove.  Pleased with product and seller.	1
Update: this is more like a dull pearl. Not flattering...it shows every nail ridge and imperfection...  Also, it's surprisingly difficult to remove! this really isn't what i was expecting.  i thought it would be more clear with more sparkle.  as with the other matching pink shellac/vinylux, the matching  vinylux color is a peachier pink.  i really really like the polishes, though.  look good, easy, last a long time.	1
Does not match the beauty of the Beckoning Begonia shellac, but comes close.	1
i have this in shellac, and vinylux is not as pink as the shellac.  i love these polishes, though.  i like the shellac colors better than the vinylux. Here are some true color comparisons: Romantique, Lavishly Loved, Beau, Negligee. And Negligee is the most pink.	1
Great polish, dries within 8 minutes & lasts 2 weeks if not more! Beckoning Begonia is a cross between a pink & lilac. It is very very beautiful!	1
very pretty color it really does stay on my nails (which don't hold any other polish longer than a day) about 5 to 6 days. I do use scrub free first, then a coat of CND sticky base, the vinylux, then the vinylux top coat then just to try to keep longer I do add a coat of CND shiny top coat. I know it seems over the top but this works for me	1
Will be my go-to color for spring.	1
Lasts/wears a bit longer than OPI nail polish.	1

I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THIS POLISH. IT WEARS  FOR BETTER THAN TWO WEEKS. BELLA	1
This is the best of the Vinylux pink colors by far because of its hue.  If you want a good coverage, you need three thin coats, but don't worry...this dries very fast.  I've tried other colors, but I love this most, and it REALLY does last for a week!  Just be sure that you use OPI BonfAid under it, and Vinylux Weekly Top Coat when you've finished putting on the nail polish.  It lasts and lasts beautifully during that week.  You won't be disappointed.	1

Polish stay on as advertised. A longer dry time but I feel it is worth it. If you apply it correctly it does not chip for at least 5 days.	1
Great color. Good nail polish for a couple of days.	1
Literally one of my top 5 polish colors of all time. It's a beautiful neutral, without being pink. I rarely do the same manicure twice, but I have made exceptions for this (and I add Safety Pin as an accent). I will always suggest this as a perfect basic neutral that is a definite Must Have!	1
I adore this color, especially when paired with Field Fox (Safety Pin used as an accent nail). It has a slight silver color to it, but it's very neutral with a kick. Two thin coats is plenty for opaque coverage.	1
Best color and polish ever!	1

The color is cute.  I am rough on my nail polish - regular polish lasts me only a few hours.  I usually use CND gel polish (at home) and can get about a week out of it.  But it is a longer project to get on, and then to remove.  This polish lasted me 2-3 days and was easy to remove.  I would expect it to last longer on most other people.	1

I absolutely LOVE Vinylux because it does exactly what it says it does - lasts for a week.  I always precede it with OPI BondAid and then finish with Vinylux Top Coat.  However, this looks absolutely pink which is what I wanted.  It isn't anywhere near pink, not in the vicinity of pink, and not even a nodding acquaintance with pink.  It's a dusky transparent lilac.  If you want it to be opaque, coat your nails three times and it looks great.  But it's not pink!  I want pink!  I'm keeping this however, b/c I was going to look for a shade like it soon anyway.  It does last a week, and it looks beautiful.  It also dries faster than typical nail polishes.	1
Great color, lasts a long time.	1
Beautiful color.	1
great color	1
WOW!!!!! is my first reaction to this polish!  I've tried 3 polishes, the typical polish, acrylic gel, and Vinylux weekly polish.  The typical polishes begin to chip after a couple of days even with a pre-coat and a top coat.  The acrylic gels were not good for me; it ruined my nails and I couldn't use polish on them for 5 months, though I must admit that this is likely not a typical reaction to acrylic gels, but it was mine.  After seeing my nails finally back to their stronger condition, I decided to have a professional manicure, and I was happily introduced to Vinylux - though I was a bit wary of it.  No need for me to have been.  The manicurist first applied OPI Bondaid, then two coats of the Vinylux Cake Pop shade polish, and finished off with Vinylux Weekly Top Coat.  The manicure actually lasted for an entire week, and the only reason that I had to redo my nails was that you could see that my nails had grown since the manicure.  I'd already purchased, after seeing Vinylux last for 4 days, the Weekly Top Coat and another shade, Grapefruit Sparkle.  I re-did my nails doing everything that the manicurist did, and Voila!  The Vinylux lasted for a full week!  I purchased two more colors, this white one included, and I'm thrilled with this polish!  I use the white to mix my own colors as well as using the colors as they come from Vinylux.  They don't hurt my nails in any way, and they don't chip or peel for the entire week.  This is a small miracle!  I love this nail polish - if it's possible to love a polish - because it absolutely delivers what it says it will do.  Be sure to get the Bondaid and the Weekly Top Coat because I don't know if the manicure will last as long without these two products.  This is a fantastic find.  I wouldn't use any other nail polish, and I shall purchase more because it's so fantastic.  One thing about the color, Romantique, it's not anywhere near as pink as the picture shows.  I can still use it, but I was expecting a real baby pink, but this is much paler than that.  Vinylux is still the best nail finish I've EVER used!	1

Beautiful dark plum. Only two coats needed. Great for fall/winter season.	1
Really gorgeous dark navy with hints of  peacock blue.	1
This is my favorite go to Vinylux color.  Sms to also stay on longer than some of the others.	1
This product doors nor work with Vinylux polish also by CND.  My nails fell apart with this gunk. It took two months to grow my nails out so that I could wear polish again. .	-1
I love vinylux, surely it does not stay for a week, but it stays much longer than other brands.	1
I like vinylux, but this time I received the old nail polish, it was dried.	-1
Love vinylux. Stays for a whole week.	1
It was a little sheer at first but after 3 coats it's a real bright peach color.	1
The color is very beautiful!!!	1
Not true to its color, way more closer to a white-which is pretty disappointing when you think you're getting pink. See picture for details.	-1
Pretty color; the picture doesn't give it any justice; looks much better in person.	-1
Love these polishes easy to apply, dry in under 10 minutes & they last!	1
Awesome color -- not overly bright for work. Also very long lasting.	1
Pretty color--very bright and love the polish itself. Really lasts.	1
Nice bright color after 3 coats, cause at first it is streaky.	1
Have used this product Before. When applied w the top coat, it is excellent. My pedi lasts for 2-4 weeks.	1

I am a licensed nail technician and use CND vinylux polishes. The butterfly queen  color is gorgeous. Lasts longer than any other polish I have used.	1
Beautiful color but it took 3 coats to get an even and opaque look. Per directions, used scrubfresh first and finished with the weekly top coat, but lasted really well. Two pictures - one right after application, and second after 7 days. Pretty good after 7 days (see attached picture), although my thumb and first finger show a little wear on the edges, but for 7 days of cooking, cleaning, and gardening, pretty good! Not as shiny or strong as shellac, but then again, it removes like traditional polish and the whole process is SO much easier/faster than shellac, so its a fair trade off. Would purchase again in different colors.	1

The color is definitely not as red/pink as the photo, but has more of an orange undertone. I bought this through the seller Beauty 4 Us...not sure how long the product was sitting on the shelf, but it had some hard bubbles when I applied it, and it only lasted Monday night through Thursday of the same week. Other Vinylux polish I bought at the store lasted >7 days. Will not buy from this seller again, but still recommend this polish line.	-1
This isn't any good unless you're looking for a see-through polish or topcoat. It's almost completely transparent.	-1
Too see-through to wear without 4 coats. As soon as you do more than two coats it never dries. So it's basically impossible to use this product.	-1
No. It's thick and floppy and streaks. No. I shellac my own nails... And I am not a nail tech. Way too hard to use...	-1
So brown it might as well be black. I didn't like the color - but can't return it.  You should know that you can't return these nail polishes.	-1
Not that great. Doesn't last as long as it should.	-1
Do t love the color too much	-1
Online this looked ok but in real life it is awful. Most colors are pretty true to form from the website but this one was awful.	-1
Nice color, but it doesn't last as long as it claims. Chips within 2 or 3 days. I tried with and without a base-coat and it was the same story. Won't be purchasing again.	-1
I ordered this because My Daughter said it was really good. It will not stay on my nails and I would like to return it if I can.	-1
I did not like this polish and would like to return it but can't figure out how to return it	-1
I love shallac and thought this would be a good substitute. I ordered two colors and this color is my favorite shallac color.  This is not worth the price. Applied it in the evening while watching tv. By 10a the next morning I had a chip. With in a couple of days I had many chips and I'm not hard on my nails at all. I will never purchase this brand again. Opi is so much better. Loved the colors though.	-1
I have purchased a number (5) of vinylux products--and this is one that has given me nothing but trouble. First off, I'll admit that I'm not a nail professional. BUT I did my own gel nails for 8 years (until the primer caused an allergic reaction) and I do my own CND Shellac nails. So I think I'm pretty careful and "professional" in my application of products.  That being said, I have had such poor results with this color -- it is streaky and difficult to get to an even, smooth color. (There is no way you could use the "two thin coats" that the instructions suggest--you would just have streaky, half-see-through color). Then when I get it looking ok, it chips off within one day. I have problems with the others colors really staying good for more than a week (much less than advertised), and it may be that because this is so dark, the chips are especially noticeable. I love the color -- but I just don't want to hassle with trying to get it to last more than a day. I have tried applying the polish exactly as instructed, tried using the top coat as a base coat, tried curing it with a UV light, applying it SUPER thin, and applying it thicker--but it always fails. (Yes, I do seal the edge.)   Also, this color STAINS!! My nails are a terrible orang-y color after using this for 2 weeks (numerous applications).  While Vinylux is much easier to remove than Shellac, it doesn't wear nearly as long -- I just can't decide if it's worth using either.	-1
This made my eyebrows look like I had put gel on them. It looked AWFUL.	-1
Unfortunately, this ends up being very drying for my skin.  I tried it for a week, but I found that I was getting dry spots along my forehead and nose.  Once my skin began to feel itchy, I just gave up and bought my normal face cleanser from Sephora.  For $20, I was expecting more.  It looks like I'll be going back to Purity.	-1
I bought the gel by mistake. I much prefer the foam cleanser. This one does not foam as much .	-1
The foaming action is fantastic and it cleans the makeup off really well.  But this combined with the La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Epidermal Accelerator Pro Recovery Skincare is leaving my rosacea prone skin a mess.  I am suffering for more breakouts and flareups.  It looks like I am going back to the Toleriane line.	-1
unfortunately this product did not make any difference in my oily acneic skin. I woke up everyday with different pimples. I used this in conjunction with the effacer k...OH boy what a mess this left behind. Now I am using a product I found online, totally but mistake and is working wonderfully on my skin.  I wish the seller can read this maybe I still have time to return it. I just threw in my junk drawer almost halfway full. If this works for anyone, I would be happy to sell it to you @ half of the cost.	-1
Dont waste your money on this product line didn't help.. try peter thomas roth or dermalogica from ULTA.com Ive tried alot of other brands on the shelf	-1
Not for flat iron protection. My hair smelled burned all day and when it got wet that night in shower. I will use it up as shine spray only. Too $$$ for shine spray.	-1
Makes my hair feel rough and coarse. I have an almost full bottle that I will never use.  I am just using it until my other heat protectant comes in the mail.  I don't know how well this spray does at protecting hair from heat, but it makes my hair feel dry and rough.  My hair is much softer when it dries without this product in it.  It even makes my hair more difficult to comb through once the spray dries in my hair.  I don't like it at all!	-1
I am in my 30's and this product is causing me to break out with pimples. I though I was done with all that. Anything else I use seems to keep my face pimple free. Staying away from this as much as possible.	-1
Cheaply made - did not last long at all.	-1
The product is made of plastic, so I feel like Im going to break it if I press too hard. This may be better if it had some metal parts to it. Also, I feel as thought my eyelashes don't curl as much.	-1
Did not curl my eyelashes very well.  In fact...couldn't even get eye lashes in!!	-1
I've been on the hunt for a good eye makeup remove for a while. So far all of  the brands that have been recommended to me either aren't very good at all  (Clinique) or contain aloe (Neutrogena). Some of the products I've wanted to  try (like L'Oreal) had scary reviews. I had hoped that this product from Vichy  would be different.   The Amazon product page gives the description of the product as a "highly  effective, yet gentle eye make-up remover to hydrates [sic], soothe and help  reduce the appearance of fatigue." The product is supposed to effectively  remove eye makeup while soothing the under eye area.   I will say that the product is rather soothing. It doesn't irritate the  sensitive skin around my eyes, nor has it caused any irritation or dryness or  anything like that. It also doesn't sting if it gets into my eyes during use.  However, it doesn't do much toward removing my eye makeup, either. No matter  how careful I am, no matter how much I put on the cotton pad nor how much time I  take swabbing the eye area, I still have product come off onto my towel when I  dry my face. I cleanse my face again before bed every night, and yet I still  wake up with black smudges under my eyes every morning.   I confess, I do wear a lot of eye makeup - every day, I wear shadow, liner, and  mascara. Before I ever swab with eye makeup remove, I use cold cream and a warm  washcloth to remove most of the makeup. It doesn't get it all obviously (I wear  contacts and you don't want to risk getting cold cream in your eye, and you also  don't want to scrub too much in that area) but it gets a lot. The fact that  this product can't remove what's left is a big disappointment.   Perhaps it would work better for someone who wears less makeup. But I can say I won't be spending $17.00 for another bottle.	-1
It works and it has a nice scent, but. . .  I wear a minimal amount of makeup.  Some mineral powder on my face and eyelids. Some non-waterproof crayon eye liner and wee bit of eyebrow pencil. No mascara.  It took four totally soaked cotton pads to remove my eye makeup. I usually use olive oil to remove my eye makeup.  It works well, cleans up quickly, but well, it's olive oil. I wanted to try and like something else.  I wasn't even sure the stuff was working at first. It seems so mild at cleaning. In spite of the mildness, my eyes stung, though the feeling dissipated quickly.  I used one more pad to clean my face, just to see how it did. It easily removed the mineral powder. I'm glad I tried this, because I could really tell how drying it was to my skin.  I will not use this product again.  The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because it does remove makeup, however slowly, and it's got a lovely subtle smell.  If you have oily skin and wear the most minimal makeup, it might be right for you. For me it's a fail.	-1
My girls didn't find this product to be very effective at removing eye make-up. They both tried it and told me that it isn't as god as the stuff they normally use. They told me not to get this again and said they probably won't use it anymore, so I can't give this a good recommendation - especially at the price it is being sold for.	-1
I usually use Bobbi Brown Perfectly Defined Gel Eyeliner in Steel Grey, which I love. I wanted to try this because I had heard that it was easier to apply and gave a nice cat eye. I had a hard time getting the Stila to apply to my eye at all. It is very light and I have to go over the area several times before you can even see it. I will stick with my Bobbi Brown!	-1
I bought this product based on the high ratings. But my eyes water and this liner didn't perform any better than all other liners and pencils I've tried. After only a few minutes the liner is smudged. I also don't like products packaged so that I don't know when it's running out. Am very surprised at the number of glowing reviews I gave it two stars because it is easy to apply (though not so if you want a thicker line) and it's very neat to use. At the price, I wish I'd gotten my money back.	-1
This is a very light, silvery color, not the darker gray.	-1
Note: The ACTUAL Stila Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner I LOVE and HIGHLY recommend. However, I am giving 1 star because that is NOT what I received. I received a Stila Waterproof Smudge Eyeliner, not the Liquid as this product indicates. Had to return and just ordered the real thing from Sephora.	-1
Check the color carefully.  After applying, my husband thought I was suffering from "Pink Eye"!  Very light!	-1
Typical white powder that leaves a residue and does not work.	-1
It does make your hair less oily but also leaves it flaky no matter how far away from your head you spray it. Pantien dry shampoo works better and id cheaper	-1
Yes, I bought this luxury shampoo after much consideration. I read about it in Lucky magazine and that beauty editor has never been wrong. The shampoo isn't bad, but it didn't do much for my hair except make it a little dry & fuzzy. (My hair is straight w/ layers) It has a nice smell and a weird consistency. I'll use it (cause I have it) but it isn't that great.	-1
I do not care for this shampoo. It is so thick that it is hard to judge how much to use. Also for the price, I expected more. I will not purchase again, I can get better results with a less costly shampoo!	-1
WAY to expensive with no better results then a cheaper shampoo.	-1
I'm not sure that it does anything to moisturize my cuticles, but it seems that it slowed down its growth. I must say I never met an oil that did anything good for my skin, body/face/cuticles - none.	-1
Did not notice any difference... It even seems that my cuticles are drier.	-1
I try to really give products like this a hard-core test. If it works well, I can always treat the other eye etc. For example, I reviewed a microdermabrasion kit that I used on only one side of my face :) Well, I used this Anti-Wrinkle Firming Moisturizer on only one eye. I used it religiously, in the morning and at night. Every single day.  I see absolutely no changes whatsoever. My eyes look exactly the same, even upon the closest inspection. My skin around my eyes does not feel firmer, the wrinkles are just as pronounced. No change. At the very high price tag, I would think I'd see something. I want to, Lord knows I got right up on the mirror and gave it every chance! :D  In my opinion, this is a huge waste of money. I will continue to use this for another two weeks and report back if there is any change.  Sheri Gill - Writer, Mom, Mage	-1
The Redermic C is a good product and makes my skin look good, but truthfully, I don't see much change in my skin as a result of using it.  And, it has a very pungent scent that often gives me a headache when I use it.  The scent tones down after about 20 minutes of application. In all fairness to this product, I have many allergies, and am especially sensitive to some scents and perfumes..  Otherwise, I would give 4 stars.	-1
After reading all the warnings and potential contraindications, I think I will not use it on my face. It contains "Hyaluronic Acid Mannose" and promises "Re-plumping texture."  It has exterior packaging containing braille and is meant to be a sunscreen for the face. Yet is warns one not to leave where children can reach it, not to use it on damaged or broken skin and the Vitamin C in it may turn skin yellow and stain clothing. Also, it has no indication that it has not been tested on animals and is, therefore, probably not a cruelty-free product. The box also states that it for sensitive skin, anti-aging fill-in care.  I think I will stay with my wrinkles and current moisturizer with SPF without all of the scary warning.	-1
don't like both the texture (too thin) and color (too orange), I'm amazed at all the 5 star reviews.  Elta MD Lightly Tinted for Extra-Sensitive Skin is far superior sunscreen.	-1
If only it didn't contain these ingredients ^^ it might be a decent product. Raise the zinc oxide and leave out the chemical filters and the aloe vera please.  It has a ton of silicones too, so if your skin reacts to silicones with acne, give this one a pass.	-1
I returned mine.  I didn't notice any difference in comparison to my cheap $20 hairdryer.	-1
If I had never owned a chi and had been using a Remington or something than I probably would have loved this - it does seem to be of good quality but didn't come close to my chi - the chi dryer dries my hair much faster leaves it smoother and shinier	-1
I don't see any benefits provided by this spray. The stars I'm giving are for the great design of the bottle. I wish I had a bottle like this for all my sprays, it's right between being a mist and a spray so it layers on your skin nicely. But I've used this on myself repeatedly now and see no benefits or any kind of difference on my skin. I don't recommend it, seems like a gimmicky waste of money.	-1
I don't really get it. I've been using this product for a few weeks, and I've not noticed any benefit. My skin doesn't feel or look different. I can see where a mist would feel refreshing after working out, or during the summer. I think it's important to moisturize right after washing my face with clean water, to help retain the moisture. It's also my understanding that, under most circumstances, minerals and other nutrients work from the inside out, not sprayed on top just to evaporate.  I'm not sure what I was expecting with this spray. As mentioned, this will probably be refreshing on a hot day. But I'm just not seeing any other benefit.	-1
I am disappointed in Vichy's facial lotion with SPF 25 as it is greasy and thick. It sits heavy on the skin and literally feels heavy on the skin. It has a too strong fragrance that does not dissipate, I keep breathing it in and the fragrance gave me a headache. I am going to stick with Elta MD UV Daily Clear SPF 46 (or 40) as it is a light daily facial SPF face lotion that I can use under makeup and it has no fragrance (and despite it feeling light and non-greasy it does work great to prevent sunburn).	-1
I wanted to find a good hydrating lotion that was good also to protect against skin damage. SPF is needed nowadays. I have sensitive skin, looking at the product it says its good for sensitive skin, even "soothes" it. Allergy tested.  First off it smelled, like old lady which I hate. I have people who love to kiss and hug on me, and the last thing they want to think of is "granny" getting past that, it felt oily on my skin, burned a little, made my eyes sting and I did not even get close to them! my sensitive skin broke out into redness and i instantly washed it off. It had to be the fragrance in it and the tocopheryl acetate which is so well known to cause an immune response( rash, redness burning)  in people with allergies/sensitive skin.  when will companies realize that stinky lotions are out? and harmful ingredients?	-1
This is a nice quality product with a very intense smell that I immediately had to wash off as I was applying my makeup over it. The smell is meant to be, I am sure, quite pretty. However, everyone knows that you don't always love the perfumes that others are wearing. So, when I cosmetics company adds a scent that is so strong, and it is meant to be applied right under your nose -- this is just a huge mistake. I had to give it one star, because the smell actually made me feel like I was choking. However, I would truly not recommend this to any friend of mine, because so many of us suffer from allergies. In the past when I've purchased a face cream that I don't really care for, I have at least been able to repurpose it as a hand cream. Not in this case, because the perfume is so offensively strong. Absolutely not recommended..	-1
Active Ingredients: Zinc Oxide 8%, Octinoxate 7.5%, Octisalate 3%, Inactive Ingredients: Plantago Lanceolata (Plantago) Leaf Extract*, Leontopodium Alinum (Edelweiss) Extract Water*, Calendula Officinalis (Calendula) Flower Extract*, Cyclomethicone, Ethyl Hexyl Isononanoate, Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C), Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate Dimethicone/PEG-10/15 crosspolymer, Lauryl PEG-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer. *Certified Organic .  I make my own sunscreen as well as I purchase sunscreen for times when I do not have time to make any since I need to surf. For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection. The more zinc, the more protection but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to VCO. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun. For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high zinc oxide is the best solution. A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful of ingredients, certified organic at least 95% and FREE OF; fragrances, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, or UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane and alcohol. What goes on the skin is the same as being consumed through the skin. Chemicals, alcohol and fragrances are no protection for the skin.  Alcohol, Perfume & More Chemicals... No wonder there is no image of the back labelling or any image of the ingredients anywhere not even on Sun Burn's Website. This is sold at Macy's and Nordstrom. The fact is that when you pay as much as eighty for 160z, you're mostly paying for a lot of fancy packaging and marketing, including the cost of the supermodel spokeswoman in the Magazine ads. It gets worse when a cosmetics company is pushing different potions for day and night, for the face, eyes, lips, neck, body and feet. That really adds upwhich is exactly what that company is counting on.	-1
I have naturally fair skin. I spend time in the sun and develop somewhat of a tan but my base is definitely fair. This product gave my skin a tone that was definitely more orange than bronze. With self tanners you have to be extremely diligent during application or you'll end up with streaks. I got a few streaks from this product but nothing major. My biggest issue is the resulting color. Maybe deeper skin tones would have better luck with this product. Sadly I can't recommend it for fair skin tones.	-1
This product  left and oily appearance on my skin	-1
Not the actual Mario badescu vitamin c serum. I think I was delivered a fake, it's usually of a yellowing color but mine was perfectly clear and didn't smell the same. Ripped off.	-1
I have been using this serum every other day for 2 weeks, and have been breaking out terribly. I have combo skin. I don't notice any positive changes whatsoever to my skin from this, I have just been breaking out with big cystic acne on my cheeks, small bumps and zits across my jaw and all over my forehead. I can not continue to use this product as it is doing more damage than good.	-1
Mario Badescu rocks.  Great, rich serum, leaves skin so soft. Update: still love all my Mario Badescu products-esp this serum-but the dropper is as cheap as they come.  I've ordered 2 vit C serums so far and both droppers came apart before I was even 1/3 of the way through the bottle.  Since Vitamin C turns bad so easily with out a tight seal (and stored in cool, dark place) both bottles turned before I was even half way through.  Not worth the money with out getting an entire bottles worth of serum!	-1
This is a very very light violet color.  I was expecting something a little darker.	-1
More a clear polish with sparkles in it than the silver polish I was hoping for. I have used it over red and pink polish as an accent on one nail but wouldn't wear alone as it is too clear.	-1
This color doesn't look good in two coats. Have to apply three coats. And probably because of that it chipped in 5 days. Normally I am wearing CND products for 3-4 weeks.	-1
Doesn't stay longer than 4-5 days ,bad quality.	-1
Don't waste your money	-1
Don't waste your money	-1
this is not professional grade like it says, I waited for an hour and it still did not dry. Do not waste your money..	-1
Deep red..... peels too easily	-1
Very matted color,  Peels too easily	-1
Too Dark, peels easily!	-1
I don't understand such a pretty color.  Every now and then some of CND Shellac colors will wrinkle on me even if o put very thin coats.  This bicycle yellow did that and now I do not use it.	-1
Very thick; color is a very bright "cooked salmon" color.  Like the lightest part of cooked salmon only really, really bright and then add the thick and uneven texture of the product itself and it is just awful!  My mom loves orange, coral, salmon and just about any combination of orange there is but hated this color and I did too.  I have purchased several and this is the absolute worst!  It is a shame that you cannot return bad product.	-1
Typically, CND is known for high quality and this polish did not come close to meeting my expectations. The color is not pretty whatsoever, so I have to use an additive or another polish over the top to transform the color. Plus, a week into my manicure, and the tips of my nails are all faded and the polish is wearing away. I do not have this problem with other brands of gel polish, which are much cheaper priced than CND! I should have returned this...	-1

This is the clumpiest Shellac polish I've ever used.  It's very difficult to get the polish even and smooth.	-1
This is an opague metallic nude color with a tint of yellow/orange. It looks clean but not a very pretty color.	-1
It's too light a color for me.	-1
I received a diferent color something turqoise...not even close with the color I orderd.	-1
I should have known by it's name - Clearly Pink.  It is definitely clear.  Absolutely clear.  Just a clear coat with the slightest, slightest, slightest hue of pink.  Almost invisible.  I wouldn't waste my money.	-1
In my personal opinion, color is good to be used as base for another one.  Didn't like it using it alone-very solid color, no glossy or pearl like finish.	-1
Color is nice but liked better Tutti Frutti that has a beautiful gloss finish.	-1
Tooooo light. Its top coat. I swear. No color at all.	-1
I'm always on the lookout for a good nude polish, and I thought this one would be a nice addition to my new and growing Shellac collection. Unfortunately, it is so sheer that you can barely tell I even have polish on (aside from the brilliant shine you get from Shellac). First I applied the recommended 2 coats, then a third, then a fourth! You could still see the white edges of my nails as plain as day, although they looked a little dirty at first glance. I like the idea of this shade, but unless you're into your nails looking like they are dirty instead of polished, I wouldn't purchase this product. Maybe in the future I'll just use it as a base for French tips or other nail air, but I will never use it as a stand alone color.	-1
I had no idea what I was getting into with this "polish" - had I had any idea it was only to be used with a UV light I would have passed on it.  The light systems available are either cheap (poorly made) or way to expensive, and beyond what I want to invest in a nail "regimen"  Pretty color though!	-1
I thought this would be a fun color, but it was gloppy and did not go on my nails well. I would not get this color again.  Sorry.	-1
The name of this shade is "Clearly Pink" -- they should have left the Pink off. This has absolutely NO color -- it may make a great shiny polish, but the packaging and the name are way off base. I feel deceived and wish I could have my money back.	-1
I absolutely hate this color. It makes my nails look yellow?? I had it on for 2 days and had to take it off - I couldn't stand even looking at my nails with this color!!! I thought it would be pinkish and it WAS NOT.	-1
I have used about half of the CND Shellac colors. Although I'm disappointed in the Spring 2013 "collection" (if you can call 4 colors and a glitter a collection), I decided to order LIMEADE and Lilac Longing. The Lilac I LOVED. It is the perfect Easter egg shade of lilac - I can't say enough good things about it.  But this LIMEADE is an altogether different story. It is SO neon and SO annoying to the eye, like radioactive neon, that I could not wait 10 days until my next mani - I had to get it removed within a week.  If your skin is iffy with neon green, I'd stay away.  My friends are amused with my variety of color changes every 9-10 days, and usually I get compliments, but LIMEADE got "2 thumbs down" across the board. I'm now wearing CND Gotcha, a bold medium matte pink, a definite winner. I have started requesting 3 thin coats for the best coverage.	-1
This color is sheer. 2 coats provides barely any coverage, more like it tints your nails lime green like they are stained. I tried it on and ended up covering it with another color to complete my manicure. Really bad color, wish I never bought, will never wear.	-1
Thought this was going to be a gray color but it is a brown for sure. Not an ugly brown but I'm not a fan of brown anything really.	-1
I am disappointed in this color.  I was so excited for the new spring colors!  I like pastels and I thought this "grapefruit sparkle" was going to be a nice shimmery light lavender color based on the one photo they had available in this product page.  I was assuming the picture was accurate since there were no previous reviews and there was no description of the polish I had no reason to doubt it...  Then a few days later my shellac arrived; and when I first opened the amazon box, I thought they shipped me the wrong polish by mistake because what I saw was a very, very light pink polish bottle that said "sheer" on the packaging.  The last thing I wanted was another clear pink polish. The first coat was barely detectable apart from a light shimmer effect.  It literally took 5 coats of color before I couldn't see the white of my own nails showing through since the polish was so sheer.  This item is non-returnable so now I am stuck with another polish that may as well be the same color as the other half dozen pale pink totally sheer polishes shellac sells, just with a different name on the label.  Everyone knows the thicker your gel polish is, the more quickly it starts to peel off.  Now I will use it up twice as fast (5 coats for each manicure instead of my normal 2-3 with non-sheer colors) and it will peel and need to be re-done in half the time (I'm on day 3 and it is starting to lift on the tips of my nails already despite my "wrapping the color around the tips.")  To summarize: Unless you are looking for a French manicure style, very sheer, hardly noticeable pale pink polish, don't get this one.  I will try to upload 2 pictures for you.  One of the how it looked with just one coat and a 2nd picture of the color after coat 5.	-1
Really dislike this. Kind of a dirty pearl color...I need to find a color to use with it....would definitely not buy again	-1
Bought this thinking it would be kind of a coral color..it's more of a crayons orange. Hope to find a color to use it with, dislike it alone	-1
I love this color but had problems with even coverage.  Maybe an off day for me. The polish has specks with a beautiful shimmer and dark green undertones. Will try again and see how it works second time around.	-1
This color is so much more lighter than the bottle, and what is written on CND's website!  I love the concept, but the color is for a small child, not an adult!	-1
I agree with the other reviewers who state this is thick and not as good as other CND Shellac polishes.  Where I'm a huge fan of the whole Shellac system, this color is really thick, hard to apply thinly and shows the brush strokes after curing.  It still holds the great shine and long lasting benefits of Shellac but I'm just not a fan.  Also, the color doesn't seem to suit my skin tone very well.  I'm pretty fair and the color seems to blend into my skin, so it looks kinda funky.  I'll be giving this to a friend...	-1
super disappinted with this one. love the color. sadly i just can't get it to apply nicely. once i finally got it looking nice, as soon as i put it under the lamp, it withered up. it looked like when you get a fingerprint on tacky polish -- but nothing had touched it. boo! no idea what caused this. i had read others mention "shrinking" - maybe that's what it is. i also notice a little bit of clumpiness during application.  am presently soaking off hence no caps as i am irritably typing one handed.  UPDATE-- applied Hollywood after. It worked like a charm. No idea what the story is with the Fedora, but I hope they fix it, because I love the color. As expected, the color's similiar to OPI My Private Jet. Please fix it CND!!	-1
I like soft pinks and found that this is too hot pink for me.  One of the reviews thought it wasn't pink enough.  I like more subtal tones, so this was not for me, even using one coat.  I will never use it again.  The one I love so far is Negligee.  Althought the bottle is acually white, the color is a classic, beautiful solf pink, see through slightly.  Very classy.  I would never wear hot pinks, blues or crazy colors.  I am going to try some reds for the holidays, I ordered Decadance.  I like the color of it in the bottle, but haven't tried it yet.	-1
This color is similar to a bubble gum sparkle pink.  It looked like it would be a creamy beige to me or at least I hoped it would be.  Looking for a nice neutral shade.  It was anything but.  This one will be tossed.	-1
You gave me 2 little ones a the rest were the big ones.	-1
This will tear your face up	-1
The items may be great for others but these products left my face extremely dry with scars on my face.  I now have to see a dermatologist to help clear.	-1
I love Image Skincare but I don't love the Vital C line. I love the Ageless (silver label) line the best. But I do have to say I have a LOT of allergies and this line seems to bother me. I do tend to have acne breakouts too when I use the serum and get dry patches from the "hydrating" repair cream (why is it dehydrating me??)... my aesthetician claims the serum is bringing out all of the impurities and that is why it is breaking me out.	-1
It's just not for me.  I don't like the smell or how it feels.  I use a liquid makeup, then the mineral makeup, then use compact makeup to further set it.	-1

Major eye issues when using this I originally ordered this cream to use in place of my go to eye cream (EltaMD eye gel) because I was simply trying to save some money as the StriVectin was cheaper. On all accounts it is an excellent product, the formula is chocked full of great ingredients and the cream itself is nice and thick and absorbs well. At first I thought it was my new go to cream and was so excited, that is until after using this for over a month I came to a sudden realization, that this cream was the sole cause of my recent major eye problem (and no I never used it in my eye, just around it as indicated). I had started to have blurry vision in my eyes, they did not sting etc so I did not even think of attributing the blurry vision to my eye cream. Initially I thought my problem was due to allergies, but the problem persisted and in fact became much worse. It was so bad that I visited an eye doctor who said my eyes were "frothy" and asked if I had been using any new makeup or eye cream. Once again, I did not even think it could be this eye cream since in my mind I thought if it annoyed my eyes it would be stinging. I was referred to a corneal specialist at this point because something was certainly wrong, the blurriness progressed and was so bad that I was literally depressed because I could not even read a can at the grocery store and almost did not feel safe to drive. I was confident that somehow I was loosing my vision. As a last ditch effort I ordered my original EltaMD and used it and literally the next day just like that, no more blurry vision! I am still shocked that this product did what it did to my eyes and still shocked that any cream could ever do something like this as I have used hundreds of brands over the years and nothing like this has ever happened to me. Of course, my situation is hopefully unique with this product, however I am taking this stuff back to Costco and never trying it again. I am SO relieved that my semi blindness is gone now and I can see again and so bummed I did not stop using this sooner after weeks of depression and agony. Hopefully this product does work for others, however for me it is far too harsh for my eye area.	-1
Tiny tube of basic cream.	-1
Used faithfully twice a day as instructed. It's slightly greasy and my makeup would smudge. No noticeable improvement for me in skin texture, smoothness, tightness, hydration, or lightening dark circles. Big disappointment.	-1
Expensive for what you get. Works great until it doesn't.	-1
It doesnt seem to get hot enough	-1
*UPDATE* I've been using and loving this curling iron for a little over a month now and today it just stopped working. I didn't drop it, it didn't get banged around, nothing weird happened to it except for me using it a few times a week. I'm dropping my rating down to one star.  I don't mind paying more for a tool that does something amazing for me. In this case, this iron gives me soft, shiny curls that last all day. BUT, so does my Revlon wand at a significantly lower price. The thing that sets this curling wand apart--and above--for me is the time. I don't know if it's because of the way this wand retains heat throughout the barrel or what but I can curl my entire head in about 1/3 the time it normally takes me. That's huge in my opinion.	-1
I have looked all over for the glove and can't find it. I checked inside the packaging twice. Is there a secret compartment on the handle that holds the glove that I can't find? Meanwhile, I don't see why they could not have put a few spikes on this to hold the hair in place rather than make you wear a glove and then change the glove hand to do the other side of your head. That's a lot of work. But I can see this is how all the female commentators on Fox News end up with those spirals of hair on their shoulders. I am concerned that none of the other reviews say theirs came without a glove.  This is very expensive for what it does. Couldn't you just twist a regular curling iron around the ends of your hair?  Meanwhile, if it touches your face -- and that's not hard to do when you are trying to twist the hair on the side of your head around it -- you burn your face. A few spikes would have served as a buffer between your skin and the hot rod.	-1
Did not curl my hair at all and I used it sometimes three times in the same spot. This type of iron also doesn't let you curl the very ends as you have to hold them with your fingers. Heats fast, has automatic shut off--at least that's in its favor, but for me, it didn't do anything but curl my ends. I will just use rollers. Lot less heat damage and more curl. I do like the fact this comes with a travel bag, but I don't see myself taking it anywhere as it does not work. Not sure what I think of the glove. Found it hindering.	-1
Whaaaat? Are we going back to the dark ages or what with this curling iron? No thing to hold your hair in place and they give you a glove to prevent burning yourself when you are putting your hair around the hot iron! Seriously, heat up a poker in the fire and use that instead. This was a waste of my time.	-1
This is the third or fourth ceramic curling iron she's tried.  Some of the others worked pretty well, and have made it into the rotation and are used frequently.  This one doesn't look like it will make the cut.  First of all, one temp.  No adjustment like a couple of the others.  That limits it depending on a person's hair.  She already isn't as much of a fan of the clamp-less curling irons but one of the ones she uses the most also has no clamp, just the glove, so she's accustomed to it even if she prefers the ones with clamps.  But those she said seem to do much better getting a curl to stay than this one does.  She complained that this one leaves her hair already coming out of curls that same morning.  Despite any prep she tries to do with her hair, this just doesn't seem to get things in place as long as the others.  The other issue is that the rotation for the cord just isn't very smooth.  For a curling iron that costs this much, you expect more.	-1
This is the worst product I have ever used! If you have relaxed hair - beware! My hair was in very good shape but I like to use protein every week - I used this once and my hair broke off all over. I have been crying for hours.	-1
Nothing was said that I noticed about the product having glitter in it, but it has sparkles and I don't care for that look.	-1
This stuff is garbage.  It is greasy and sticky and dried out my oily skin to parchment! It took a month to recover from this junk. Save your money!	-1
This curling iron works so-so. I am not convinced, even though I love the babyliss straightener. It leaves your hair smelling burnt. (My hair is extremely thick so I needed to set it on the hottest setting otherwise it won't curl for me.) If you have thin hair this might not be the case, but if you have thick hair and are looking to buy this, I would go with a different iron.  The actual curling part of the curling iron is a good size for long hair. I have long hair and I don't have to recurl.  ******I added images***	-1
It's a well made hair wand but your hair slips off. It's difficult to get a curl when your hair slides around. Mine came chipped on the barrel I returned it	-1
Does not provide enough true exfoliation. Formula is much too drying, most likely due to high alcohol content.  I have very oily skin and this product over-dried it, making it oilier and caused me to break out.  I prefer straight glycolic acid products that are made to be put on the skin for a few minutes and then washed off.  This product is made to be "left on" and I think that adds to the drying problem.  Like the Bioelements line, but cannot recommend this one.	-1
I received 3 pairs of these eye gels in a gift basket, have now used them all and won't be buying more. They're easy to apply and remove, feel cooling and refreshing, and did "wake me up" a bit. But firming and de-puffing as they say? Nope. I used my 3 sets once each in the morning, midday, and before bed---no difference in performance.  So, nothing special here to justify the cost. A freezable eye mask, cold washcloth, or cucumber slices would work just as well or better.	-1
This is your typical silicone face primer. However I do not find it fills in lines and pores at all. It just gives your foundation a smooth base to go over. However I have pores and this did nothing for them AT ALL. Didn't really work for me. However if you have oily skin this might be good for you as I noticed it did absorb oil decently.	-1
After 20 minutes of battling with this container, I STILL could not get anything to come out.  It has a weird applicator.  And unlike other creams, there's no way that I can figure out to remove the strange applicator to actually get to the product, because the pump thing that's supposed to apply it clearly doesn't work.  My fingers hurt from trying to pump the thing for so long, and I think I would have to actually break it to get inside of it.  I don't even want to use it now, it's infuriating.	-1
I feel this product falls short of its promises.  While it may be organic certified and contain ingredients such as organic apple and white grape juice as well as organic oils, the name suggests "Stem Cell" which has other scientific connotations.  I do believe this is misleading.  While the moisturizer goes on without feeling greasy, I did not notice any cell turnover that you might see with other products containing Retin A or Glycolic acid.  I really did not notice any huge difference.  What probably I disliked the most about this product is the smell, very citrus, but not in a good way, more like an Old English lemon polish.	-1
This actually does a good job as a moisturizer.  I have fairly dry sun damage marks on my arms, legs and a couple on my face.  I moisturize my face daily, so it's difficult to notice a big difference on how this product works there.  But unfortunately I'm not nearly as diligent with my arms and legs.  So picked a few dried out spots on those areas and applied it once.  One application and those areas and wow, immediate difference and it lasted for days.  I never noticed a difference like this when applying body moisturizer.  After using it for about 10 days (twice a day for 2 days and once a day since), I can't say that I see a difference with the fine lines around my eyes.  The two spots on my face do appear to be somewhat lighter-looking in color.  My face also has a natural redness to it which also seems to have lightened somewhat.  I can't claim to like the smell which is like lemon scented cleaner.  It was more of an issue for me the first few days, but now if I don't think about the scent when applying it, I don't notice it anymore.  Amended 10/18:  The day after posting this review it suddenly became difficult to pump out any more product.  The jar itself still feels bottom heavy, but apparently I'm about out of product.  So if I'd used this as described, twice a day, this might have lasted only about 1 week.  There are benefits to using this product, but the majority of consumers won't be able to afford it.	-1
11/13/2014:  Much to my disappointment as this really is a rich and delightfully scented cream, I found a week or so into its use that it was making my eyes water, as in wash away eye makeup water.  I am unable to continue using it!  First impression review: Let me state right up front that this cream is fabulous.  It has a delightful fruity smell which, unfortunately, does not linger long after application.  No need to rub this rich formulation across your skin--it literally glides on and a little goes a long way which is good considering the cost.  I have only used it for a few days so I can't speak to whether or not it  has favorable effects on skin appearance, but I assume other reviewers speaking favorably on the subject are pleased with their own experience.  That said, I'm wondering about this" proprietary fruit stem cell blend infused into a Vitamin C, resveratrol-rich grapeseed formula" business.  My understanding is that Vitamin C serum on your face is good, and resveratrol is a worthy anti-oxidant.  It took me awhile and a little creative searching on pubmed.com to tap into the botanicals-as-skin protectants research world after a "fruit stem cell" search on Google resulted in little but cosmetic industry nonsense.  There is a lot of research supporting the DNA reparative qualities of plant derivatives, particularly those from green tea, grapeseeds, lilacs, and Swiss apples all of which, apparently, are rich sources of polyphenols and proanthocyanidins . A lot of genetically twiddled mice bred to never grow hair spent a lot of time drinking green tea in their water bottles or having it slathered on their wrinkled, pink, hairless hides before exposure to UV light to prove that green tea is a super-duper protectant and repairer of sun-damaged DNA.  And the application of lilac leaf stem cell derivatives to sun-bathing colonies of human skin cells growing in petri dishes modulated UV damage to their DNA in a satisfying sort of way.  Human trials sunbathing with their hides still in place?  Well...there aren't any.  My conclusion?  Botanicals are good, but buying a luscious expensive cream filled with fruity goodness of uncertain strength and unsupported benefits is a luxury that I probably won't pursue on a regular basis.  I will, however, continue to drink a matcha green tea suspension, creepy green in color and faintly tasting of grass clippings based on an enormous amount of research evidence that green tea polyphenols are good for my skin and all the rest of me too.  Maybe I'll even spring for a $14 DIY instruction manual on making one's own antioxidant skin cream.	-1
I read reviews on this product before purchasing it at Costco and many people have nice things to say about it.  However, one review I read was from a dermatologist, who just made the comment that creams that work on stretch marks and wrinkles are different.  Anti Wrinkle creams need to relax the skin and stretch mark creams need to tighten the skin, so it's believable that it would do one, but not both.  That said, I decided to go ahead and give it a shot.  To start, it's a nice smelling moisturizer.  But the first week, it caused me to break out (I have sensitive skin).  Still, I persisted.  The breakouts eventually went away, but I used it for about two months and saw no noticeable difference in my fine lines on my face.  I have returned to my old standby moisturizers and my face feels much better for it.  I have not used it on stretch marks, but since I have quite a bit left, that it what it is relegated to now.  If I notice a difference in stretch marks, I will update my review, but for now it is not worth the cost.  You can get much better for less.	-1
I cancelled my order after realizing that the sellers here are selling UNBOXED product.  There is no way to tell expiration without the box.  Why else would they be 70% off?  My wife loves this product and I'll be looking for other options.  Having worked in retail for a number of years, a good rule of thumb is that anything over 60% off the MSRP starts to raise red flags for me.	-1
Not good for stretch marks , I use a lot of it on stomach, butt and breasts because Im prone to get some in those areas so the big tube doesnt last long enough for me to see results, I use twice daily so I ran out very fast and for the price I wish I had a chance to have seen more results but I don't want to risk again another 100+$ on this bc Im scared .	-1
This product compares itself to botox...this product doesn't do anything even close to botox...it is a complete SHAM!	-1
Arrived fast with prime shipping. However, I was super disappointed by the small size of the tube. If you remember the original strivectin that came out several years ago, the tube was big. Anyway this was too small for me to justify keeping. The scent is minty and clean which I really like, but the product is tacky and hard to smooth on, you would also not be able to use makeup over this as it remains "sticky". Too bad they couldn't just leave the original strivectin alone. I'm returning it	-1
This product is a very thick, super-greasy cream, that smells like peppermint.  I was a little taken aback when I opened the tube and saw the consistency.  Two of the main ingredients are vegetable oil and shea butter, and since I'm acne-prone, there was no way I could put this on my face.  I chose to test it on my neck, back of my hands, and some stretch marks.  This does not absorb into the skin. Applied (sparingly!) in the morning, the areas I used it on remained tacky and sticky the entire day.  I couldn't wear a necklace for fear of ruining it.  Still, I continued to use it twice/day, hoping something amazing would happen.  And... nothing did. My skin in all test areas looked exactly the same. I don't know who this works for, but it wasn't me.  Not recommended.	-1
Check if this is okay because this gave me skin irritation	-1
I had THE WORSE reaction literally burned my skin and I used as directed. Would not recommend for anyone with even moderately sensity skin.	-1
I don't like it. I don't understand why so many ladies love it, which I am not one of them. It does not feel good on my lips, feeling like a wax to me.	-1
I've used about 1/4 of the jar...I haven't noticed any benefit at ALL from this stuff. Honestly...the best lip moisturizer I've ever used (and as you can see..I never stop trying to see if there's even BETTER)...I've tried MANY different brands and formulas....is Avon's Moisture Therapy lip moisture STICK.. I tried this when I was out and in between Avon reps (sorta...long story). Don't waste your money on this.	-1
So I guess in Amazon's world this is a three star review... Because by three I mean actually one... I am torn giving low rating because I like the product. There are enough good reviews however that my score likely won't change the average much. I was very disappointed with this order because it clearly says TRIO in the title of the item and another reviewer noted even the photos imply you will get three. That's why I ordered! This lip balm is for me good. I have dry skin and I like what it does for me and the smell too. I used this before in Europe where it's cheaper. The US price if really $20 per jar is a lot. Although note the size of this is quite a bit larger than most and a jar lasts a really long time. Three for $20 would be a great price for it. I would pay $10 too but $20 I wouldn't have purchased had it not been stated there would be a trio of them, i.e., three!	-1
Okay. This smells like lemon floor cleaner (I expected it to smell neutral or like honey... I mean, there is nothing about "citrus" in the name). The texture is weird. It's thick and yet slides right off my lips. It doesn't absorb. All of the citrus ingredients aren't really good for the delicate skin on your lips... they are acidic. I got this anticipating dry winter lips, yet not actually having them. I left this on as an overnight treatment the night I got it, and I woke up with dried-out lips. WTF. Not only that, it was ridic expensive. If someone gave this to me and told me it was from, like, Bath and Body works, not only would I believe them, but I would likely throw it away. As it is I will try to give it to someone, because this was way too much bank to trash. The hype is not real. This is just the emperor's newest suit, like so many other cosmetic products with a high price tag and that "luxe" buzz. Don't buy into it. It is not worth the money and the time waiting for it to reach you (it took more than two weeks from the seller I bought from).  Here are products I WOULD recommend: -Lucas' PawPaw ointment. Now, if you want an actual "overnight" lip treatment for chapping, this is it. It's also a little pricey but you get a lot more quantity and good quality. It also has that "buzz" around it to some degree if that attracts you. Packaging is cute. It can be used on cuts to help them heal as well, and that's legit... -Egyptian Magic or its cheaper dupe, Sweet Bee Magic. I prefer the former because its consistency is less greasy and smeary, but both work very well for dry skin of all kinds, to include lips. Packaging on Egyptian Magic is very cute. I use it everywhere on my body not prone to breakouts, to include lips and undereyes. -Dr. Hauschka makes a lip balm with a very slight orange-y tint, which is all-natural and very effective. -Weleda Everon lip balm is the one I always come back to, which is surprising as it's the most affordable of these. It has an herbal smell a bit like roses and tastes neutral and good. It does the of moisturizing very well although it is not as thick as Lucas' or E. Magic. You'll have to reapply more, and it's more for the day than for a treatment. -Finally, Lush's Honey Trap is great. This has a thick texture, a bit gritty almost, stays on forever, and smells and tastes divine--- it's made with white chocolate!! It's very moisturizing and can be used during the day or with a thicker hand as an overnight leave-on. My choice if you're going to be doing some making-out, as your lips will taste like really awesome honeysucklely chocolatey candy, but not in a weird Bonne Bell way. -Finally, when I have legit chapping or cold sores, I cannot beat Blistex's medicated balm in the blue pot. It tastes medicinal but it really works. Hope this was helpful!	-1
This is a very very light violet color.  I was expecting something a little darker.	-1
More a clear polish with sparkles in it than the silver polish I was hoping for. I have used it over red and pink polish as an accent on one nail but wouldn't wear alone as it is too clear.	-1
This color doesn't look good in two coats. Have to apply three coats. And probably because of that it chipped in 5 days. Normally I am wearing CND products for 3-4 weeks.	-1
Doesn't stay longer than 4-5 days ,bad quality.	-1
Don't waste your money	-1
Don't waste your money	-1
this is not professional grade like it says, I waited for an hour and it still did not dry. Do not waste your money..	-1
Deep red..... peels too easily	-1
Very matted color,  Peels too easily	-1
Too Dark, peels easily!	-1
I don't understand such a pretty color.  Every now and then some of CND Shellac colors will wrinkle on me even if o put very thin coats.  This bicycle yellow did that and now I do not use it.	-1
Very thick; color is a very bright "cooked salmon" color.  Like the lightest part of cooked salmon only really, really bright and then add the thick and uneven texture of the product itself and it is just awful!  My mom loves orange, coral, salmon and just about any combination of orange there is but hated this color and I did too.  I have purchased several and this is the absolute worst!  It is a shame that you cannot return bad product.	-1
Typically, CND is known for high quality and this polish did not come close to meeting my expectations. The color is not pretty whatsoever, so I have to use an additive or another polish over the top to transform the color. Plus, a week into my manicure, and the tips of my nails are all faded and the polish is wearing away. I do not have this problem with other brands of gel polish, which are much cheaper priced than CND! I should have returned this...	-1

This is the clumpiest Shellac polish I've ever used.  It's very difficult to get the polish even and smooth.	-1
This is an opague metallic nude color with a tint of yellow/orange. It looks clean but not a very pretty color.	-1
It's too light a color for me.	-1
I received a diferent color something turqoise...not even close with the color I orderd.	-1
I should have known by it's name - Clearly Pink.  It is definitely clear.  Absolutely clear.  Just a clear coat with the slightest, slightest, slightest hue of pink.  Almost invisible.  I wouldn't waste my money.	-1
In my personal opinion, color is good to be used as base for another one.  Didn't like it using it alone-very solid color, no glossy or pearl like finish.	-1
Color is nice but liked better Tutti Frutti that has a beautiful gloss finish.	-1
Tooooo light. Its top coat. I swear. No color at all.	-1
I'm always on the lookout for a good nude polish, and I thought this one would be a nice addition to my new and growing Shellac collection. Unfortunately, it is so sheer that you can barely tell I even have polish on (aside from the brilliant shine you get from Shellac). First I applied the recommended 2 coats, then a third, then a fourth! You could still see the white edges of my nails as plain as day, although they looked a little dirty at first glance. I like the idea of this shade, but unless you're into your nails looking like they are dirty instead of polished, I wouldn't purchase this product. Maybe in the future I'll just use it as a base for French tips or other nail air, but I will never use it as a stand alone color.	-1
I had no idea what I was getting into with this "polish" - had I had any idea it was only to be used with a UV light I would have passed on it.  The light systems available are either cheap (poorly made) or way to expensive, and beyond what I want to invest in a nail "regimen"  Pretty color though!	-1
I thought this would be a fun color, but it was gloppy and did not go on my nails well. I would not get this color again.  Sorry.	-1
The name of this shade is "Clearly Pink" -- they should have left the Pink off. This has absolutely NO color -- it may make a great shiny polish, but the packaging and the name are way off base. I feel deceived and wish I could have my money back.	-1
I absolutely hate this color. It makes my nails look yellow?? I had it on for 2 days and had to take it off - I couldn't stand even looking at my nails with this color!!! I thought it would be pinkish and it WAS NOT.	-1
I have used about half of the CND Shellac colors. Although I'm disappointed in the Spring 2013 "collection" (if you can call 4 colors and a glitter a collection), I decided to order LIMEADE and Lilac Longing. The Lilac I LOVED. It is the perfect Easter egg shade of lilac - I can't say enough good things about it.  But this LIMEADE is an altogether different story. It is SO neon and SO annoying to the eye, like radioactive neon, that I could not wait 10 days until my next mani - I had to get it removed within a week.  If your skin is iffy with neon green, I'd stay away.  My friends are amused with my variety of color changes every 9-10 days, and usually I get compliments, but LIMEADE got "2 thumbs down" across the board. I'm now wearing CND Gotcha, a bold medium matte pink, a definite winner. I have started requesting 3 thin coats for the best coverage.	-1
This color is sheer. 2 coats provides barely any coverage, more like it tints your nails lime green like they are stained. I tried it on and ended up covering it with another color to complete my manicure. Really bad color, wish I never bought, will never wear.	-1
Thought this was going to be a gray color but it is a brown for sure. Not an ugly brown but I'm not a fan of brown anything really.	-1
I am disappointed in this color.  I was so excited for the new spring colors!  I like pastels and I thought this "grapefruit sparkle" was going to be a nice shimmery light lavender color based on the one photo they had available in this product page.  I was assuming the picture was accurate since there were no previous reviews and there was no description of the polish I had no reason to doubt it...  Then a few days later my shellac arrived; and when I first opened the amazon box, I thought they shipped me the wrong polish by mistake because what I saw was a very, very light pink polish bottle that said "sheer" on the packaging.  The last thing I wanted was another clear pink polish. The first coat was barely detectable apart from a light shimmer effect.  It literally took 5 coats of color before I couldn't see the white of my own nails showing through since the polish was so sheer.  This item is non-returnable so now I am stuck with another polish that may as well be the same color as the other half dozen pale pink totally sheer polishes shellac sells, just with a different name on the label.  Everyone knows the thicker your gel polish is, the more quickly it starts to peel off.  Now I will use it up twice as fast (5 coats for each manicure instead of my normal 2-3 with non-sheer colors) and it will peel and need to be re-done in half the time (I'm on day 3 and it is starting to lift on the tips of my nails already despite my "wrapping the color around the tips.")  To summarize: Unless you are looking for a French manicure style, very sheer, hardly noticeable pale pink polish, don't get this one.  I will try to upload 2 pictures for you.  One of the how it looked with just one coat and a 2nd picture of the color after coat 5.	-1
Really dislike this. Kind of a dirty pearl color...I need to find a color to use with it....would definitely not buy again	-1
Bought this thinking it would be kind of a coral color..it's more of a crayons orange. Hope to find a color to use it with, dislike it alone	-1
I love this color but had problems with even coverage.  Maybe an off day for me. The polish has specks with a beautiful shimmer and dark green undertones. Will try again and see how it works second time around.	-1
This color is so much more lighter than the bottle, and what is written on CND's website!  I love the concept, but the color is for a small child, not an adult!	-1
I agree with the other reviewers who state this is thick and not as good as other CND Shellac polishes.  Where I'm a huge fan of the whole Shellac system, this color is really thick, hard to apply thinly and shows the brush strokes after curing.  It still holds the great shine and long lasting benefits of Shellac but I'm just not a fan.  Also, the color doesn't seem to suit my skin tone very well.  I'm pretty fair and the color seems to blend into my skin, so it looks kinda funky.  I'll be giving this to a friend...	-1
super disappinted with this one. love the color. sadly i just can't get it to apply nicely. once i finally got it looking nice, as soon as i put it under the lamp, it withered up. it looked like when you get a fingerprint on tacky polish -- but nothing had touched it. boo! no idea what caused this. i had read others mention "shrinking" - maybe that's what it is. i also notice a little bit of clumpiness during application.  am presently soaking off hence no caps as i am irritably typing one handed.  UPDATE-- applied Hollywood after. It worked like a charm. No idea what the story is with the Fedora, but I hope they fix it, because I love the color. As expected, the color's similiar to OPI My Private Jet. Please fix it CND!!	-1
I like soft pinks and found that this is too hot pink for me.  One of the reviews thought it wasn't pink enough.  I like more subtal tones, so this was not for me, even using one coat.  I will never use it again.  The one I love so far is Negligee.  Althought the bottle is acually white, the color is a classic, beautiful solf pink, see through slightly.  Very classy.  I would never wear hot pinks, blues or crazy colors.  I am going to try some reds for the holidays, I ordered Decadance.  I like the color of it in the bottle, but haven't tried it yet.	-1
This color is similar to a bubble gum sparkle pink.  It looked like it would be a creamy beige to me or at least I hoped it would be.  Looking for a nice neutral shade.  It was anything but.  This one will be tossed.	-1
Never ever again ...in couple days of using this product my skin burning and red and I am in pain..	-1
Still waiting for results promised. Way over priced for your basic moisturizer.	-1
Ugh. Phenoxyethanol! A neurotoxin, skin irritant, and potential carcinogen, why can't we stop using this in our products? Because it's a preservative to extend shelf life and people are already wise to the evils of parabens, that's why. I didn't know it was in this product before I agreed to try it, and when I saw that it was way down the list of ingredients I thought that a tiny schmear of it wouldn't matter. But it did. Despite the nice light fragrance and smooth hydrating feel, my skin became more irritated after each use. (Yes, I'm ridiculously sensitive.) Too bad. The packaging is beautiful, with a mirror on the top of the jar, and all. But I'm back to using a few drops of a pure lite olive oil applied with a swatch of paper towel before bed. My skin eats it up, it has no smell, and my face is moist and radiant the next day. It was Sophia Loren's secret, olive oil. Not nearly as chic as this Vichy product, but a lot healthier at present. Maybe L'Oreal will find a way to remove the bad chemicals while keeping the chic!	-1
This cream is extremely thick.  You just need to barely touch your finger to the surface to get enough to smooth over your entire face.  Even using such a small amount, this started clogging my pores my the next morning.  By the next day, I could see little whiteheads all over my forehead.  Since I'm age 50+ and have dry skin, I haven't dealt with whiteheads in years.  I won't be using this any more.	-1
I couldn't see that it did anything for the lines around my mouth.  They are supposed to be smoker's lines although I do not smoke and it's been 15 years since I did, I noticed nothing when I applied it above my upper lip.  I was hopeful but I saw nothing.	-1
It's hard to write a review on a non-performing product. I smeared the cream in the contours of my eyes and onto my lips. I waited. I did the same thing in the evening. I waited. Next day, same thing. I waited. Nothing. No difference.	-1
The ultimate test for any facial cleanser I use is - will it remove my waterproof eye makeup fairly easily and without too much rubbing? Unfortunately, this water facial cleanser did not pass that particular test. I applied on a cotton pad as directed and tried to wipe off my waterproof eye makeup.  It took three minutes of too-vigorous rubbing to get it to completely come off.  However, if you don't have waterproof makeup then this gentle cleanser might be for you. My skin did not react negatively to it after a couple weeks of use.  There is no smell, no dye. It feels and looks ...like water.  Even with just regular makeup, however, I felt that I need a more substantial cleanser than "water" because my skin still felt dirty. I would use another regular cleanser after this and indeed picked up quite a bit of makeup on my washcloth.	-1
UPDATE: Began to burn my eyes after a few uses. They stung so much. I will never use this Vichy or recommend because of the burning. I don't understand why it hurt so bad after a few uses.  ORIGINAL REVIEW (Four Stars): The Vichy Normaderm 3-in-1 Micellar Water Facial Cleanser is good, but I felt like my skin still had cosmetic residue on it after I used this product with a cotton pad. I had an unstoppable urge to wash my face with water & regular cleanser after using this, which I did. My skin felt much cleaner after that.  The cleanser also spilled into the sink because it pours oddly, so just make sure to put your cotton pad over the hole before upturning the bottle. This is great stuff for removing my (not-waterproof) mascara, but I will probably follow up with my regular cleanser.  I like this to take off makeup, but won't recommend to fully remove dirt and cosmetics all over your face.	-1
This turns my lips the brightest ugly pink. I threw the box away otherwise Id return it.	-1
Product is good but the lip container needs improvement. Top won't stay on so I won't buy again. it really bothers me that you pay this kind of money and it does not work right, There is BARELY any color. I won't buy this shade again.	-1
I think I don't understand this product.  Or perhaps it just doesn't work with my body chemistry.  Either way, it didn't work for me.  I have this in forever pink and it just doesn't add a noticeable enough pop of color to my lips or my cheeks.  It's way, way too subtle for my taste and I don't have particularly dark skin or lips.  (I have light/medium skin with a neutral tone.)  I also don't particularly care for the balm-like texture on my cheeks.  It's fine on my lips but on my facial skin I prefer the more liquid-y stains.  For a stain product I much prefer the tints from Benefit such as Cha Cha Tint and Lollitint.  I own both of those and find the results to be much, much better.  With those tints I find that the color payoff is more pronounced, yet still has a natural-isn look.  Not a fan.	-1
The perfume is so strong in this lotion, I could smell it before I even opened the box.  Plus there is a foil seal on the tube which was sealed as it should be.  I tried using this for two days now & just can't stand it.  It is giving me a headache, add to that, my hands still feel dry.  I get a really thick "hard butter" at my local farmers market that is fabulous.  This stuff by AHAVA has nothing on that little farmers hand treatments, also the stuff I normally use contains organic essential oils which have never given me a headache.  Because of the perfume, I tried using this on my feet where I have some pretty bad calluses.  I can tolerate much better when it's on my feet.  It seems to be helping soften the calluses but I'm going to try the previously mentioned hard butter as I expect I'll have better results. Overall this is not a product I would recommend to anyone, nor would I purchase it.	-1
When I first got this, I set it on my bedside table until I was ready to use it. When I went to bed that night, there was a super strong smell and I couldn't figure out where it was coming from. It was coming from this container of hand cream, which hadn't even been opened yet. I had to move the tube into my closet just so I could sleep. When I finally unsealed the tube and used some, which I was a bit hesitant to do because of the smell, I was completely nauseated by the amount of fragrance coming off of it. I am very sensitive to smells but even if I wasn't, I feel like this would still be way too strongly scented. As for the moisturizing capabilities, I only had this on my hands very briefly before having to wash it off because of the smell. In that short period of time, I wasn't terribly impressed. Add to my other complaints the fact that this costs $28. I will stick with my $9 bottle of Curel for 13 ounces.	-1
It softened my skin dramatically. I don't quite have leather foot, but I do like to go barefoot when possible and that includes outside. So I have tough skin. This worked well. I wishy smells smells all right, is creamy and hydrating without being too oily - but it has t had triclosan in it. Something the EU has or is taking off the market because it isn't safe to use. So, yeah. I won't be using this again.	-1
After reading the ingredient label I've decided to avoid this product. Triclosan is an unnecessary ingredient that is being proven to have harmful effects on the body. Minnesota has already banned this ingredient (beginning in 2017)	-1
Ugh...the minute I opened this I got a strong whiff of fragrance. What is it with these manufacturers that they add potentially irritating scent to their products. I do not want to smell like my face cream. Nor do I want to risk breakouts. The cream seemed to go on well but so do others and at the price point it is not a good value. Fragrance, high price, decent moisture but not the best - I will take a pass on this product.	-1
No good!	-1
I'm not a guy, but I have several skin issues that plague many men like excess oiliness. Plus, I really don't like to look like I am wearing make-up, so I had high hopes for this. First the pro: It's easy to apply. The big chapstick-like tube is really hand to stash in even the smallest purse. However, this doesn't outweight the cons which are numerous.  The cons:This is very chalky and much lighter than I expected. Also, and this is the biggest drawback, it doesn't cover that well. I had only mild undereye circles and had to reapply it 3 times to get proper coverage, and it still wasn't enough. I can't see most people wearing this but especially not most guys since this is more obvious than most.  My advice: save your money and head to Maybelline, L'oreal, or e.l.f. All three of these lines have far better concealers that are a lot cheaper.	-1
I was so disappointed in this shade. I love Stila shadows, and this is their iconic shade. I'd heard about "kitten" forever.  But I'm 47, and I have aging eyes. I had no idea that Kitten had so much sparkle to it. Not so much glitter but definite sparkle. I used UD shadow primer and then kitten, and my eyes looked bogged down and tired.  It was quite nasty. The sparkle aged me by at least a decade.  If you're eyes are hooded at all from age, run away from this.  It just accents the wrinkles and the puffiness.	-1
This product is like spraying water on your hair. I don't see any difference! It seems to smell like oribe so i'm assuming authentic product is in the bottle. I can name so many other products that work better! this is a rip off, and I wish I could ship it back, but this particular product is nonreturnable :(	-1
I got one compliment after I used this product, but I feel like it drys out my hair because it's made of alcohol.	-1
I didn't think I'd ever rate an Oribe product a one star, but sorry Oribe, you dropped the ball on this one. This stuff is absolutely awful! For as wonderful as the Oribe shampoos have been, this product is worse than dippity do..for those of you old enough to remember. It makes my hair stiff and heavy and sticky, like I've used a ton of hair spray. In fact..hair spray works better if you flip your hair over your head and lightly spray the underside, it will give more volume, and far less heavy stickiness. I don't apply a lot of product to my hair, but this stuff, it seems that ANY is too much! I had to wash it out of my hair the next day because I couldn't stand the way it felt. If you want your hair to feel like your wearing a helmet, then this is for you! Otherwise, steer clear. It is one of the absolute worst products I've ever used. So, if you want your hair looking and feeling like a bird's nest, then go ahead and spend all that money on this stuff, but I sure won't buy it again!	-1
Buy an alternative!	-1
Good moisturization with no greasiness, but the scent is overwhelming. I prefer to not smell like I bathed in old lady perfume.	-1
This cream was expensive and it does nothing special for your skin. My hands and legs a very dry and that's even after applying the cream right after a shower. I also find the fragrance very overwhelming. I wouldn't recommend this cream because it does nothing.	-1
Would not buy!!!!	-1
Like my review of the hand cream, I really don't care for this cream. It's expensive and it does nothing for my skin. I apply it to my damp to dry skin after shower and ten minutes later I feel my skin tight and looks ashy. The fragrance I find very unpleasant to. Really can't recommend this product.	-1
It just arrived today. It was sealed in plastic and then inside a bubble wrapped envelope.  I was disappointed that it has a very strong fragrance, I could smell it before I even opened the bubble insulated envelope.  Disappointing because I really like most of the AHAVA products, but I am allergic to most fragrances. Unless it works miracles, I won't be purchasing it again.  Fortunately I ordered the smallest size.	-1
Stay away	-1
This is pretty dark orange and streaky, not a great color for fair skin.	-1
I love the facial sunscreen but this left little white "beads" all over my face. No matter how much I shook the bottle or blended it it there was this little white "bead residue" all over my face that would not soak in or blend. Im so disappointed in this product as it was not inexpensive and I was hoping to use it on my upcoming tropical getaway, just purchase their facial sunscreen and use Neutrogena tinted makeup instead. Total waste. so bummed	-1
I did not like this sunscreen at all, it made me look like a ghost.	-1
don't like both the texture (too thin) and color (too orange), Elta MD Lightly Tinted for Extra-Sensitive Skin is far superior sunscreen	-1
Initially I was super excited to review this bottle of perfume.  I figured if I didn't like the fragrance, I'd at least have a nice bottle to display in my bathroom.  Well I lost out on both accounts.  The perfume smells like an old lady (musty and dingy) and the bottle is super cheap looking/feeling.  Nothing about this product is worth the $50+ they are charging.  If you're even considering this perfume I suggest you stop into the store and take a wiff of it first!!!!	-1
You know when you go to family reunions and there is that one woman that you try to avoid because once she hugs you, you are going to smell like her for the rest of your life? You know exactly what room she has been in, but you can't tell if it was 1 minute ago, or lingering from the last family reunion 5 years ago. Well, this is the perfume she uses.  I took one whiff of this perfume and decided it was not for me. Or really for anyone under the age of 85. It is pungent, flowery, but most of all smells like old lady.  Buy it for that relative you dislike so you always know where she is.	-1
Wow, I smell like Grandma with this perfume.  This smells very sweet and flowery and not very sexy or modern at all.  I have to admit that I will discard the remainder of this product.  The container and sticker emblem was pretty cheesy looking too.	-1
I really wanted to like this product because besides being a perfect color match, it really evened out my skin tone and gave me the most amazing glow -- at least when looking in my house/bathroom mirror.  I didn't see a single sparkle; just a lovely sheen that made my skin look like it was glowing from within.  I was mesmerized by how perfect it made my complexion look that I was certain I had found my "can't live without' beauty product.  Fast forward to later that afternoon; while running errands I took a glance up in my car mirror and was shocked to see that apparently, a glitter bomb had exploded on my face.  I looked like a sparkly disco ball!  I gave this another try the following day using just a smidge; but it still was way too sparkly in sunlight.  Would only possibly wear this product in the evening and even then; I'm not sure it'd be worth it if there were any chance of flash photography or having to walk into a well lit restroom with my girlfriends.  I may get some use out of this as a highlighter for my cheekbones or legs; but at my age, this type of sparkle is a big no no for all over face use.  The itty bitty sparkles accentuate all the things I want to keep hidden in daylight!  Fine lines, pores, imperfections.  It only looks good under dim lighting conditions.  ***Update*** I hate throwing out perfectly good products and just wanted to share that I did find a use for this as a highlighter.  After applying makeup, a quick swipe down the center of my nose gives the bridge of my nose the perfect contoured look without all the work of contouring; no need to blend!  I also use a dab on my cupid's bow to highlight my lips and as a highlighter on my cheekbones/brow bones.  When used this way, the shimmer doesn't overwhelm your face and sink into pores/fine lines.  I'll probably have this 'forever' at the rate I'm using it (just a smidge here and there) but it's pretty much become a staple in my daily beauty routine.  I wouldn't feel put together and polished without it :).	-1
Blech. Didn't add texture and smelled bad.	-1
I wanted to love this product based on all the feedback I've heard. I have long, super thick, curly/wavy hair and this stuff really weighed it down. I was hoping for something a little more light weight. If you have a lot of hair you might reconsider buying this product.	-1
waste of money	-1
This product is sticky and the jet of spray shoots out fast and with little control. I really don't care for this product at all.	-1
If you have fine, medium length hair-forget it.  The spray smells very good but it does not add any volume to my hair.	-1
Not impressed!!! Overpriced and is no better than a dry shampoo you can purchase at any drug store. I was disappointed and sent it back!	-1
Hmmm. I cannot give this more then 2 stars.  It seems for me this is no better then a workable hairspray.  It is not a dry shampoo.  It did not add any texture to my hair and certainly no volume. It does and feels exactly like a light hairspray.  I am very disappointed I spent so much money on this.  I will go back to my Redkin Windblown - it's cheaper and it works.	-1
Product did absolutely nothing for my hair. It seemed like this product was just scented air, and that's it! Did not provide texture, volume, or anything at all. I have very thick/heavy but fine hair, very long (to my waist). I think this is such a lightweight product that it'd work best on those w/ very lightweight / baby-fine hair that is easy to volumize. If your hair is difficult to get volume in it, then I don't think this product would do a thing for it.	-1
The Babyliss Pro had great reviews. That is why I spent the little extra money to purchase this. Some one from the company must have written the reviews, because this is no where near worth the money. It is hard to get the curlers in your hair, once in, the curls do don't last at all. You have to purchase extra clamps too. Buy something cheaper. Don't waste your money on this product! Think twice!	-1
thankfully I could return these -  I have hot rolled my hair for 20 + years - these are the worst rollers I have ever used - I bought them because of the size - I wanted some larger ones for a softer look with mostly body - the problem with them is that they  take a long time to heat up and they don't get hot enough to reach the outer layer of the hair and they also take forever to cool down which the cooling is what sets the curl . I have a set of Remington rollers which I love- they have clips that are heated as well that goes over the outer layer of the hair so that your whole head of hair is soft and shiny - unfortunately they don't have them in jumbo but I was able to go to their website and purchase an extra set of the large replacement  rollers so that I can use all large instead of medium/ large so if you are looking for a primary set of rollers I would suggest going with Remington hair setter or the curruso steam rollers which I also love	-1
After reading the good reviews I decided to give these a try. I let them warm up for 10-15 minutes and the rollers felt barely warm. I tried a second time, leaving them on for half an hour and they still didn't feel hot. I tried one just to test it and the curl fell out immediately. They're very nice looking and come with clips, perhaps mine was a dud.	-1
My girlfriend was not happy with the performance of this mascara. The mascara goes on goopy and sticky, causing her eyelashes to stick together and requiring them to be combed out. She thinks that the purpose of it being goopy is to create a fuller look, but she does not want a fuller look at the expense of having tarantula lashes.	-1
This mascara goes on light for a more natural look.  However, it  did cause slight irritation - mainly itchiness.  It didn't irritate me as much as other mascaras, but I did experience itchiness the day I used it and the day after.  Since my eyes are so sensitive, my low rating was also based on the following short comings  - It doesn't apply smoothly.  It goes on with small clumps as if the mascara was dried out. - It smears.  By the end of the day I had dark circles under my eyes from the mascara smearing.  I wouldn't recommend this product even if your eyes aren't really sensitive.  The smearing is a nuisance and the little clumps when applying are a pain to remove.	-1
I had originally written a glowing review about this product a while back. I have used this product for a very, very long time. However I just opened my last bottle. An this is not the original version. This is liquid, has a rancid smell to it. Either it isn't the original product or l'Occitane has cheapen their product (i.e. 4 Reines pearlescent cream and the shower gel) that it does not pay to pay this price for the lack of quality.	-1
Brush arrived broken...had to spend 5 mins trying to reassemble the middle piece from the outer piece. I finally got it and used it twice and seems fine. Annoying though cause I bought clarisonic brand and paid the extra money. Had nothing to do with shipping..it obviously wasn't put together to start with	-1
The brushes I received do not fit into my Clarisonic. I don't think there is much more to say.  Not Recommended. prisrob 06-04-13	-1
This review is from: Clarisonic Replacement Brush Head Twin Pack for Acne Cleansing (Misc.) Ordered the DEEP PORE CLEANSING BRUSHES and some one threw the wrong brushes into the box. Well accidents happen. Amazon said this 'product is not from them' and caused me loads of grief and aggravation in trying to rectify their error. Calls, letters and a trip to the post office.........not what I expected from you guys. I bought tons of stuff and wonder why your customer service was non existent now? I think you owe me. Buyer beware --- is it Amazon or a sub contractor? Big difference in how you are treated.	-1
I really liked the feeling this device provided while I was using it.  It felt like my skin was getting very clean, but, unfortunately, after I was finished the surface of my skin was covered with tiny vein fissures.  I used it on the lowest setting and did not use it aggressively, but my skin looked almost like it had been burned afterward!  I put chamomile on my face and it calmed down by the next morning with just a hint of redness, but it scared me when I thought it might be permanent!  I love the idea of this unit and if you have hearty skin I think it could be a great benefit in keeping your skin clean and bright so I gave it three stars, but if you have Rosacea like me you might want to steer clear of any kind of device like this that aggressively stimulates the skin's surface.  Cheers, Claire  PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it's just to say, Hi!") feel free to post it below.	-1
I'm pretty disappointed by this machine. A real microdermabrasion treatment is when crystals are blasted across the skin's surface, picking up dead surface skin cells along the way. The crystals and dead skin cells are quickly sucked up through a different tube in the same wand and go to a disposal bag.  This machine has a little metal crystal-cake inside the wand. The suction pulls your skin into the want tip and rubs it against the little cake-thing, which basically scratches a layer of skins cells off and vacuums that off onto a little cotton pad just below it. I'm not so sure this is good for your skin - I could be wrong, but it's WAY more abrasive on your skin than a real microderm treatment at a spa (and I have about three sessions a year and I exfoliate daily at home). It seems to me that the suction helps plump up your skin because of the way it sucks up your skin into the wand.  I'm not willing to do this to my skin any longer. I don't recommend the machine.	-1
I was a little nervous about using this on my face, so I prepared myself by watching the instructional DVD twice and reading all of the enclosed material. The DVD is very reassuring, and very misleading. They make it sound like you just need a little practice at the lowest setting and all will be well. Not true.  Right out of the box, my unit functioned poorly with the fine tip attached. I started trying to use it on my forehead just like on the DVD. They must have turned the unit off for those DVD demonstrations. You cannot slide the tip smoothly across your face like that. If you have adequate suction, as soon as you start to move across your skin, the tip pops off your face. With my unit, suction was sporadic and mostly nonexistent with the fine tip attached.  I switched to the precision tip, which gave me more reliable suction, but I still couldn't use it as instructed, because it HURTS. I was not pressing hard, but it was like pushing sandpaper tightly against your face and then dragging it across the skin. I don't have particularly sensitive skin, but this was so harsh that I decided to check some reviews before possibly damaging my skin. I'm glad I did. I won't be using this unit on my face again. One reviewer mentioned that people have been injured by this product, and she herself was under a doctor's care to heal the damage it did to her skin.  On the DVD they say your face will have some redness for about 30 minutes after a treatment. Once again, untrue. Many hours after use, there were still red patches on my face, and my forehead and nose had a burning sensation.  I thought maybe I could at least get some benefit from the machine by using it on the dry and calloused places on my feet. For that I used the coarse tip and a higher suction level. It was a complete waste of time. The only place you can get suction is on the bottoms of your feet. No edges or contours, because you have to the the entire tip flat against your skin to get suction. I have big calluses on the outer edges of my big toes, and there was no way I could get the tip flat enough to get any suction in that area.  I cannot recommend this product, and I suggest you read a large number of reviews carefully before making your purchase decision. I'll stick with more gentle forms of exfoliation, and accept my fate of being old and ugly.	-1
Really loved the product and I bought it even though I saw several reviews that said the suction stopped working properly. Mistake-The suction function stopped working on the lower settings almost immediately (2nd or  3rd use) and after 3 weeks the suction stopped working all together. I loved the results I got during the brief use, but unfortunately had to return it.	-1
The shower gel wash leaves your skin soft and the smell is very pleasant. My husband really liked it but it is way too expensive to use on a regular basis.  The container is the worst one I have ever used. The container is square and very awkward to use. The pump is impossible to use as it stays down when you pump. I you need to pump more then you have to lift it to depress it again.  I cannot recommend this product (even if the soap smells good) as it is very hard to use and way to expensive.	-1
At the time if this review this wash was going for $25 for 10.5 oz. I usually buy all natural and organic products so I do sometimes see washes that run $10-15 for this size (although I try to buy on sale.) I admit that I agreed to review this product because I was curious about what made this shower wash so special that they could charge so much. I all don't know.  The ingredient list - missing from Amazon's page at the time of this review - includes two sulfates, petroleum by products, and a ton of chemicals in the 21 ingredients listed. Of those the are only a couple I know for sure I would count as natural: water, honey extract, silk amino acids, sesame seed oil. Nothing special here at all that I can see.  The fragrance is fine. Lightly grapefruit. Texture is standard as well. Washes fine.  All this to say that I can't see a single reason why this would be more than $6-8 at any store. I'd rate the wash as average. But with the very high price this moves into the two star realm. I don't recommend it. If you don't mind the chemicals you can buy 3 or 4 large body washes for the money.	-1
Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.  SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin's DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.  Active Ingredients: Octinoxate 3.0%, Titanium Dioxide 3.0%, Zinc Oxide 9.0%. Inactive Ingredients: Alumina, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/PEG-10/15 Crosspolymer, Ergothioneine, HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Crosspolymer, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Iron Oxides, Lauryl PEG-9 Polymethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Lecithin, Methicone, Micrococcus Lysate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Phenoxyethanol, Plankton Extract, Purified Water, Silica, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane.  This is a brand that on their Website it is claimed ""A micronized physical sunscreen, with the cosmetic benefit of a skin-perfecting sheer tint for the face""... Dumping all those chemicals along with some ZO does not make it a physical sunscreen. This mix is worse than a roof tar. I got to this product since one of the top reviewers for a phony diet publication has written a five star review on this mix. It is amazing to see what some producers get to charge for damaging chemicals in the name of marketing.	-1
Very cheap nail polish. It chips very easily.	-1
I love Essie nail polish, but for some reason this one chips off very easily. Maybe it's the shimmer.	-1
it left the stain on my nails after removed...	-1
The first time using this polish and it is very thick and does not go on evenly. Won't let me return and I'm very disappointed. I won't be buying polish off Amazon again. I usually love Essie.	-1
Essie nail polish usually impresses me, but this polish does not last more than a couple days. I would be very surprised if it was real Essie.	-1
The brush is splayed out so i can't really use it. Just seems like cheap bristles or something?	-1
In person it's different then pic	-1
Not even close to same color shown here. It was actually dark pink/purple	-1
I was so excited to see Essie nail polish on amazon.... I thought I was ordering this barely purplish more reddish wine color as seen in the product pictures but it arrived as an undesired purple. I can't return it so I wasted $9 on this color that I will never wear. I want my money back. I always rave about Essie nail polish but this was a disappointment just because the photos aren't accurate. I guess I have to buy it in store from now on to be sure of the color.	-1
I love the color Like Linen but it's super runny. I've put on four coats and it still isn't a solid color on my nails..	-1
Extremely light!	-1
For some reason when i put this nail polish on it goes on with a matte finish and looks weird. I feel like when i bought it that it had been tampered with before. None of my other essie colors that i've bought from a store has done that.	-1
I bought 2 of these and I'm very disappointed. These cost the full price of an Essie polish so I expected it to be authentic... These are watered down fakes. I wish Amazon would do a better job of regulating this stuff:(	-1
Really disappointed.  Streaky, way too sheer, and hardly any color.  Not at all what I expected from the pictures.  Went straight in the garbage.	-1
It was NOT THE COLOR SHOWN NOR WHAT I expected...its a brown/gray	-1
It was watered down! It was a waste of my money	-1
The first coat was too thin and watery!	-1
Love Essie, however this color got very thick and dried out rather quickly. Only was able to use it twice. Not to happy	-1
it may be an old Essie nail polish because it chips and comes off too easily from nails	-1
Nice color but a little too light for me.  It has sparkles in it too, which I did not know.  U might like and u might not.	-1
Not as pretty as I had hoped.	-1
The polish I received looks nothing like the one shown for sale. It looks more similar to Essie's "Play Date." This was also the first time I've purchased nail polish online. Lesson learned: stick to purchasing polish in person.	-1
I love Essie nail polish...but this color itself is only SLIGHTLY different than "Butler, Please". I purchased this in the store, and it appeared more purple under the lights which was what I was looking for. I put on a layer of "Butler, Please" on one nail and this on the next one. BARELY any difference. Still a pretty color but just be aware that it is just like this color. Now I have two of the same basically.	-1
Product received promptly in a well cushioned envelope.  However quality of nail polish leads me to believe it is either extremely old or had been sitting for a long period of time in extreme temperatures.  Nail polish is extremely watery, not at all glossy even after 3 coats. It is not the quality I am used to when compared to other Essie nail polishes	-1
Polish chips very easily  Love the color.	-1
I'm a huge Essie fan and loved this color in the salon. Bought on Amazon and it was goopy and not the quality I've learned to expect. Something was off.	-1
First, the color shown here, which looks like a soft apricot, was actually a garish orange: my toes look like I am wearing orange peel! Second, as another reviewer mentioned, the polish goes on streaky, and it was only after much effort, and much time, that I was able to achieve some semblance of coverage.  I have never thrown out a polish, but this one I did. I think I will stick to Opi polishes, they have a better quality overall.  As for this Essie polish: COMPLETE FAIL, I hated it!!	-1
Too many coats have to be applied to get the color. I was disappointed when I had to keep reappling. Polish is very thin.	-1
I have had nothing but problems with this polish. It's streaky no matter how many coats or how much Seche top coat I use. It's super pretty and makes me sad that the formula is so crappy.	-1
I like wearing neutral color on my nails and I usually love Essie.  I went with this color to get some subtle glitter.  I was disappointed with the product.  It goes on with lots of streaks.  It needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish.  I stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it doesn't last as long.  The good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  I wore it for almost a week, so that's good.  I doubt that I would have been able to do it with 3 coats, but I will experiment.  It is a good color for the office, but I still wish that it was less "watery".	-1
Im use to Essie polishes being of better quality. I had to put on 3 coats to get an accurate color pay off.	-1
This is not the real thing. It's fake and a horrible one at that. If I could put zero stars I would. So disappointed.	-1
I don't know what colors the other reviewers are talking about but I bought Green, Shake your $$ Maker.  The color looks awesome in the bottle, but when you paint it on your nails it is a very translucent green.  As one reviewer said, it looks watery.  After three coats it still doesn't look right.  I always use a clear top coat and that doesn't help it from looking terribly matte as well.  Just beware, maybe other shades fare better.  I'm a huge Essie fan and it saddens me because this looks like such a great color and they currently do not offer anything close to it.  I have discontinued colors that are similar but don't have the punch that this one has.	-1
I really loved the color, and that's why I gave it one star. After I put the polish on, it was bubbly, it was very thick to put on, like polish does when it gets older, really disappointed since this was my first Essie polish purchase.	-1
2 coats and a topcoat and still it chipped.  Thought at this price it would be better quality polish but no!	-1
I was surprised to receive RED nailpolish. This picture is deceiving. I was expecting a pink color. It shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate.	-1
I am not a fan of this polish.  It has a relatively dull finish and take 3-4 coats to effectively coat the nail.  I would not recommend that other people purchase this polish.	-1
I saw this color and it looked beautiful, a very orange coral type color!!! But once you put it on it's like matte.... In a bad way ! It doesn't have the shine and beauty as other Essie nail polish have!! Very dissapointed	-1
You definitely need to add more than 2 coats. Super sheer and my nail shows through. I'd resell it if I could	-1
I so badly wanted to like this polish.  I am all about wearing pink in October, so I jumped all over this when Cut & Blow offered a good deal on it and its companion polish, Pink Works.  Imagine my disappointment when I tried to wear it last week.  This might be the worst formula polish I have EVER worked with.  Sheer but patchy, lots of dragging, and even after three thin, even (well, as even as I could manage), there were still unevenly-colored spots on my nails.  Such a disappointment.  If you're looking for a pretty pale pink shade - KEEP LOOKING!!	-1
The color does not come out like it is pictured until you apply about 4 coats. Who's got time for that.	-1
I guess I should have read the reviews before I ordered, this polish has absolutely no shine! It looks terrible, hate it!!!	-1
Ok to be clear I have to point out that the seller was great! I received the product early and it was packaged securely. The issue I have with this polish it that it NEVER DRIES. I love essie but the formula on this one is aweful. The color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle. BUT even with one coat (I tried it out just to see if it'd dry that way) it'll smudge as soon as you touch anything. The better buy would be sinful colors endless blue!! The colors are identical and the formula's great!	-1
I loved the color.  But this entire color line by Essie chips VERY FAST.  Even with a great top coat.  Fortunately it dries fast.  But I found myself having to redo my nails almost every day with all of the colors that I bought from this line.  Making me shy away from Essie for a while...	-1
I love this color (and many of Essie's colors), but the polish gets so many bubbles as it dries that it's unusable.	-1
I was excited to receive, but it is watered down and is not the real thing.  It came out matte and runny.  I was extremely disappointed.	-1
this nail polish, although Essie brand, is horrible quality. I don't know if it's the manufacturer or the distributor, but it went on like paint thinner, no shine, chipped after a day, very flat. I do not recommend.	-1
This is not really neon. You have to put 3 coats since it's sort of clear the first coat and streaky the second coat.	-1
It's a jelly formula which means it takes 6 coats or so to be opaque. I'm super disappointed!!!! I was so excited only to be extremely let down. Awful formula, do not buy. Even over white it just looked ugly and messy.	-1
This was not as purple as it looks here. If it were more cool toned gray I would have loved it too. This color is best on darker skin tones. It looked odd next to my fair skin.	-1
When applied, this looks horrible and watery...nothing like when purchased in a store. I would not recommend buying these online. Very disappointed.	-1
The pink color advertised is actually almost clear when you put it on your nails, no matter how many coats you put on. I mixed it with a white polish, which helped, but you shouldn't have to do that. Don't expect a solid color	-1
I received a sample of this product from an esthetician in the skin products & cosmetic department of a medi-spa where I was checking out product lines. About 1 week after I received the sample I applied it to clean, healthy untreated skin and within 5 hours I had developed huge red streaks & tiny little blisters along my throat and jawline in exactly the same pattern as my fingers had applied the cream! A few days later, it started to peel..very tender and painful for several days and still shows discoloration along my jawline! After looking at the number of chemicals in this product, there is no telling which of them may have caused this reaction. From now on I will stick to my tried and true Perricone products which are created by a top dermatologist & researcher and skip these chemically-wannabes! Never again will I trust any of Strivectin's products!	-1
I had high hopes for this product due to the reviews I had read and from the product description. Sadly I will never be able to see any effects as I developed a rash that has gradually worsened over the last 2 to 3 days. Within an hour or two of applying it for the first time my neck and chest went pale pink, this went darker and spots also started to appear. I stopped using it and have been taking benadryl but so far it isn't going away, although I am sure it will in due course. A very expensive mistake!!  I had planned on buying other StriVectin products but it would seem they aren't suited for me.  I am 44 years old and have never had an allergic reaction to a skincare product or make-up in the past.	-1
Hampton Sun Serious Shimmer Cooling Spray, Pearl is very pretty. It looks quite nice sitting there next to my make up. The problem is, I'm not sure what it does. It doesn't seem to make my skin shimmer. Does skin get too old to shimmer?  But, doesn't skin regenerate, even old skin?  Not sure. I don't notice a glow or shimmer or any additional brightness. If you store it in the fridge, it does cool. I know because I tried. I put it next the the water based fragrance that I make for myself from distilled water and essential oil. Those are cooling, too. And they smell good.  So confessing that it might be my age, or my inability to discern the actual reason for this product, I had to simply give it two stars. Two, instead of one. And as I said, it is pretty to look at so that's got to be worth something, right?  I would not recommend this to my friends.	-1
I can't say I'm very impressed by this product. The bottle looks nice and is convenient to carry in a handbag over the summer. The liquid is hydrating and does provide a refreshing feeling in the summer heat.  However, there are two problems with the product that make me lose interest in purchasing it in the future. One is that you need to hold the bottle completely upright to get it to spray the liquid. This means that if you are lying in a beach recliner and want to spray yourself, that will not be possible. You also won't be able to spray your legs unless you lie on the back and lift them up vertically. Obviously, nobody will be going to such lengths to use the product.  Another issue is the heavy, cloying scent of the product. This is really not the kind of scent that everybody will enjoy. I, for one, found it quite off-putting. The problem with the scent is that it does not transmit a sense of freshness. A lighter, more fruity scent would have worked much better for the product. Overall, the product made me feel much older than I am, and this is not the effect I'm looking for.	-1
I must agree with the majority of reviewers:  This product is not effective.  My wife and daughter both tried this several times and they asked, "What's this supposed to do?"  I read them the description by the manufacturer which states that it hydrates the cools the skin the gives you a shimmering effect.  They told me that I might as well spray cool water on them.  I would pass at this product unless you have lots of extra money you don't know what to do with.	-1
Where does this product stand? Is this a sunscreen protection spray, a tan spray, a shimmer spray, a after sun spray, a skin glow product. It's a confusing domain. I really do not see a huge benefit to this product for the price.	-1
What exactly is this product for?, seems to be the question predominating most of the reviews. The confusion has resulted in lots of bashing. Is it deserved? The ingredients are mostly geared to lightly hydrate and refresh the skin. They  include glycerin, aloe,and cucumber extract which all do feel refreshing on the skin and have healing properties. Glycerin, which is the second ingredient listed after water, attracts moisture from the air and an open bottle of pure glycerin will attract enough moisture out of the air to dilute the solution to 80% glycerin and 20% water. The results shouldn't be expected to feel like an arctic breeze wafting over your skin. But it does lightly cool and refresh as it's ingredients would suggest and are intended to do.  About 5 ingredients down the list is listed Mica. Mica is a mineral that has reflective properties, included to produce the "shimmer" properties of the product. The product has a pearl tint that it transfers to you skin as well. The result can be flattering and delicate. I would guess that this spray is best suited to younger, smooth, unblemished skin where it highlights those qualities. On sun damaged or less youthful skin, it highlights the irregularities and has, perhaps, the opposite effect that a user probably was looking to achieve. What I find baffling is why the box has printed prominently, "Smart, serious sunbathing", since the formula seems to contain nothing to protect the skin from UV radiation which would make it "smart" since UV ray damage is the primary cause of premature skin damage and aging.  The ingredients would suggest this product would best serve younger women with fair completions who want to hydrate their skin during normal activities and who prefer a pale highlighted appearance. Perhaps the chemists and the marketing people weren't invited to the same meeting. If you're looking for a hydrating and refreshing toner a much better choice might be Dermalogica's Multi-active toner sold on Amazon for $25 for 8.4 oz. For "Smart, serious sunbathing" definitely buy something with an broad spectrum SPF rating of perhaps 30. For a "shimmer", there are products that have a more even and consistent effect if you are looking for reflected highlights, or consider a bottle of pure glycerine at $7 for 16 oz. on Amazon. It is still one of the best stand alone skin products and is included in a multitude of creams and lotions. I gave it only two stars primarily because the marketing seems to imply something that might give a user a false sense of security even if it does enhance and refresh that particular user's appearance. It might be ideal for your complexion, but understand its ingredients  and use it accordingly.	-1
It seems way over priced for what you're getting, because to tell you the truth it really doesn't seem to do much of anything. And although my husband likes the scent(which doesn't say much for his taste) :) I thought that it smells kind of like cheap old ladies perfume, also I didn't notice any kind of a cooling effect after spraying it on. And maybe it just didn't show up against my skin tone but I didn't notice any kind of a shimmer effect. Other than that it does look nice sitting on my cabinet.	-1
So this is supposed to be a 'cooling shimmer spray'. A 'serious' one at that. I get a better glimmer (sorry, 'shimmer') effect out of a shimmer body lotion (and a nice moisturizing effect as well) - and one that lasts long as well. Not a fan of the scent, either. I would hope that something that would go on after being out in the sun would have some better health effects (such as moisturizing, sun screen, etc) than this spray provides.	-1
I was not impressed with this product despite the hype I heard. I thought it was an after-sun cooling spray so when we got back from the pool, I sprayed myself and my daughter down. We glowed, we glittered. The only thing the description got right was, "Serious Shimmer." We were seriously glittery. There was little to no effect from the cooling side, so we showered again just to get the glitter off.	-1
This product has a pretty strong fragrance, and as far as I know, it does not have sunscreen ingredients. After a couple of painful experiences, I have decided to skin test every skin product I am ever interested in wearing. I'm glad I tested this using a TINY dot on the belly of my arm near my wrist instead of putting it on my face.  Within 24 hours, hives started on the spot I tested.  The consistency is pretty thick, and the color is appropriate for my fair, East Asian skin. I was hoping it would not cause me issues, but unfortunately, I cannot recommend this to anyone who has very sensitive skin like me. However, I have to be fair - the only reason I decided to try it was because it had a score of 3 from EWG skindeep, which means it's not very toxic. Although this is a new product, so it doesn't really have much data yet on EWG either. Try at your own risk if you are sensitive.  I thought that my skin allergy was related to chemical sunscreen ingredients, but I am beginning to think it's something else, or in addition t the sunscreen. I'm guessing I may also be sensitive to fragrance, which is the only thing in this product that got a dangerous score of 8 on EWG.  In case anyone wonders about what else I am allergic to so that it may help you decide on whether to try this, I am very allergic to the Mary Kay Time Wise sunscreen as well as the Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration SPF 30 http://www.amazon.com/Hawaiian-Tropic-Hydration-Sunscreen-Lotion/dp/B00639DLV2/ref=cm_rdp_product  However, I am not allergic to Nivea Q10 and cetaphil lotions: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB5IDW  Sorry I can't really give you more information on wear and coverage... I wore it on my wrist to test it first and now my skin is bumpy and itchy and red. However, even though I wore a long sleeve shirt today, it did not rub off very much at all. :)	-1
I don't have porcelain skin and I don't have olive skin, I have medium skin. So when I ordered a medium concealer I expected to receive something for medium skin. This is actually better for someone between porcelain and medium. It's far, far too light for my skin tone and ends up making my under eyes and chin look weird when I use it.  I also don't like how oily/creamy it feels. It's just too "slippery" for my taste and I'd rather see something that stays put rather than slides around.  Not much of me wants to continue using the product.	-1
After using the entire Vincent Longo concealer:  Pros: Lovely applicator that eeks out as much or as little as you may desire Non irritating formula Medium shade is lighter than most and would adapt quite well to light and medium skin tones  Considerations: If you use an undereye moisturizer prior to application, concealer does not do much If you have any oil or softenng products under eye, concealing effect is minimal It does tend to settle into lines you do not even know you have  Cons: It was used up in no time! Expensive!  This product contains .05 ounce for $28, my favorite Laura Mercier Secret Camoflauge 2 is .26 ounce for $32 (this product needs very little in the way of application and you can moisturize under eye area before applying), Clinique All About Eyes in a tube is $17 for .33 ounce (another fine product).  Therefore, I cannot recommend Vincent Longo's Perfect Canvas Liquid Concealer.	-1
I used the eyelash conditioner for three weeks and it seemed to be fine. I am not sure if I get much improvement to my eyelashes in this short period of time, although the package says to wait 3-4 weeks to see the results. Then I got an eye infection. I know it is not from the product because I know who I caught it from, but now I cannot continue using the product - I probably had used it during the incubation period, so the bottle might contain the germs that made me sick. I was skeptical about them having six months supply of the thing precisely for this reason. When you apply the conditioner to your eyelashes, you obviously touch them, so you introduce your germs to the bottle where they can possibly breed at their leisure. I do understand the manufacturer's lure of saving a few pennies on bottles but I would prefer to be on a safe side and have smaller packages for hygiene reasons. It was easy for me to apply even though I cannot really see anything with glasses off. Close one eye and swipe the tiny brush on the lashes trying not to touch your skin. Repeat for the other eye.	-1
This is my first use of an eyelash conditioner product. The manufacturer says to use once daily for one month before seeing results. I discontinued this after three days. There are multiple warnings on the package saying that we must not get this in our eye or let it touch the skin at the base of the eyelash. This is a very liquid product. There is a very fine line brush. I found the application difficult.  It was very hard for me to apply it to the lash it seemed that when I went from the bottom side the product was not reaching the top half.  This issue is not explained in the directions. When I close my eyes I I was having a very hard time applying it to my eyelashes because I couldn't see over to my other eye due to poor eyesight. It also formed droplets in some locations hanging off of the lashes. I was afraid to blink my eye then because of all the warnings to not let this touch skin or your eyeball. On the last day I had applied it before bedtime and in the morning after washing my fave as usual, a little later on I had a lot of itching and discomfort on the skin around my eyes. I would suggest that the manufacturer add a thickening agent to the product to make it stick on and stay in place and the. It would not form liquid droplets. For me I feel this is too dangerous with all of the warnings And due to my personal challenge with my eyesight. I have just regular myopia plus need reading glasses due to being over 40. Rating 1 star = Hate It. .	-1
When I received this product to review I was asked to wait several weeks so as to give an opinion on the lash benefits. I do t think I can keep using it for 3-4 days let alone the requested 3-4 weeks. I've used it twice with a day gap in between the days I used it and my eyes are so irritated that I don't feel comfortable continuing with it. I wanted it to work but I look worse than I did without longer lashes since my eyelids are red and puffy, I'm not sure if I'm just overly sensitive to an ingredient in this or what but it's not for me.	-1
Didn't see any difference in my hair.	-1
My wife used this, she said it's smooth, nice smell. She did not notice any reduction in wrinkles. When I told her that they are asking $74.00 per ounce she laughed out loud. She said she would never purchase a cream at that price. I agree with her. For the product itself, 4 or 5 stars. Given the price, 1 star rating.	-1
I do not wear a lot of make-up, but do apply sunscreen on my face every morning. My face is generally smooth, but will still get clogged pores and break out if I don't clean it properly (not a fancy regime, just a product removal regime, followed by a night time lotion).  La Roche-Posay Micellar Cleaner seemed to be removing my scant makeup, but on day 3 I noticed a zit in my T-zone area. Not good.  I'm back to using Neutrogena Ultra Light Cleansing Oil.  (for another baseline, the make-up removing clothes, no matter what brand, do not completely clean my face either and I tend to get a zit after about 4-5 days of cloth use).	-1
It seems that everyone who is reviewing this likes it; and while I agree that it's a pleasant serum, I just don't see a difference in my "just turning 33 and getting the start of wrinkles" skin. Perhaps I have not used it long enough; only for about a week and a half; but for the raving reviews and the cost of the item I am amazed that other than people who have skin allergies.... no one has taken issue with the extreme cost for what you get.  It goes on smooth and feels nice, I had to use two pumps to get coverage on my dry (but easy to get oily) skin.  But it wasn't enough on it's own, I definitely had to follow up with a light moisturizer or else my skin felt stretched.  But my basic problem with this is that I simply CANNOT see a difference, at all.  I like it. I would maybe spend 20.00 for it, to use it as a base for my foundation.  But for the price tag and the promises... it just doesn't hold up.  I am going to continue using the entire bottle and update this review in the future... but for the time being I just can't recommend this overpriced bottle of serum with no return; especially in this economy where every dollar counts.  I definitely would not recommend this one for the time being!  ********** After over a month and a half of using, I still see no visible difference. I still love it, but no way would I spend the money on something that doesn't show improvement.	-1
After four days of using this product as recommended, twice a day, my face is itching and I'm experiencing mild burning.  I have very dry so I was looking forward to the hydrating power of the Juice Beauty serum. This product has initially worsened my skin condition. My face feels slightly chapped as if it were windburned.  Despite the fact that this company boasts of the organic ingredients, which are rich in antioxidants, there are other things in this serum that have the potential to irritate a person's skin. It appears that one of them is having a negative affect on me:  Here is a full list of ingredients: Organic Juices Of Pyrus Malus (Organic Apple Juice)*, Vitis Vinifera (Organic White Grape Juice)*, Citrus Medica Limonum (Organic Lemon Juice)*, Aloe Barbadensis (Organic Aloe Leaf Juice)*, Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Plant Oils Of Helianthus Annus (Organic Sunflower Seed Oil)*, Simmondsia Chinensis (Organic Jojoba Seed)*, Butyrospermum Parkii (Organic Shea Butter)*, Octyl Palmitate, Caprylic/capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Malus Sylvestris (Apple Buds), Vitis Vinifera (Grape Buds) & Citrus Limonum (Lemon Bark), Organic Essential Fatty Acids Of Oenothera Biennis (Organic Evening Primrose Oil)*, Linum Usitatissimum (Organic Linseed Oil)*, Borago Officinalis (Organic Borage Seed Oil)*, Xanthan Gum, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Allantoin, Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Reticulata (Mandarin), Litsea Cubeba (May Chang) And Cinnamomum Camphora (Ho Wood) Pure Essential Oils  Some are raving about the positive results they are having with this product. Perhaps I'm experiencing sensitivity to one or more of the ingredients. Whatever the case, I'm unable to recommend this serum based on my personal experience.  If you do intend to purchase this serum be sure to look over all of the ingredients first to check for allergens or other possibly irritants. Also, be prepared to moisturize after each application--especially if your skin is the least bit dry.	-1
Glad I ordered the smaller size to sample. The smell was light and nice, but the beach spray in an aerosol just didn't work. I've tried many beach sprays and knew that Oribe was a luxury brand so wanted to try it. It shoots out in big bursts of spray, which means it won't last long. It didn't give me beach waves at all. I had better luck with $5.00 Beach Spray.	-1
Spray nozzle worked for two whole uses, then clogged up. When I tried to return it 3 days after I received it, I was told it wasn't eligible for return. I was under the impression that pretty much anything that's defective could be returned within 30 days on Amazon. Don't waste your money. I could spend half the money at Ulta and get a product that actually works.	-1
Per the wife: I bought this at Nordstrom (same price). I don't like the applicator (the brush is not easy to use and it is more difficult to control how much product comes out - I am pretty sure that I am using it at twice the rate of the regular gel, and it is three times the price). This gel dries out substantially faster than the regular gel in my opinion, making it more difficult to use. I have not noticed any difference in terms of this 24k gold firming gel, and at this price, I am not buying it again. Stick with the regular gel, which is less expensive and does the job.	-1
I started using this product with the practice attachment for about a month, and I waited a full week between uses each and every single time. I didn't see any really difference, but I liked it well enough to keep going. After about a month I went up to the next attachment which I believe is called ultra sensitive.  The first few weeks were okay. And then about a week ago I noticed that I have dark lines and discoloration on my face. Now, I initially wondered if the complaints of this might be due to stripping a tan or something. But no... the lines caused by this device on my skin are dark.  Now, when I say I watched the videos, I don't just mean the one that comes with the device. I do mean *all* of the videos. The bad reviews, the everything. And I went it planning not to use the more abrasive attachments, and not to attempt using it too often.  Maybe... maybe for some people using it every 2 weeks could solve the problem. Maybe staying on the practice head (which doesn't do anything at all, really) could be worth it. But for the price?  And the risk of having dark lines and discoloration across your face? It's really not worth it in my opinion.  I didn't pay the full price suggest here. I found it on sale at Nordstrom. And even at $60 less it still seems like a huge risk to take with your face especially if you have sensitive skin.  I did honestly like it after the first use of the ultra sensitive disc. But discoloration with the most sensitive option is absurd.	-1
This will tear your face up	-1
I was hoping this would be the mineral powder foundation I was looking for. It was not. The lightest shade was even too dark and it made my face feel very dry and even a little itchy. I only used it twice and that was enough for me.	-1
I've worn mineral makeup for quite a few years now and try and use natural products. I wanted to search for pressed powder as it's not as messy as the loose. This had good reviews so I gave it a try. Well, it's by far the worst makeup I've ever tried. It looks so oily and cakey on my skin. I only used it a couple times and it caused me to break out horribly. My understanding from other reviews is that an older formula used to be better. Maybe that's the reason for so many good reviews? I'm not sure, but I also ordered other Pur Mineral products with this powder and they were all completely awful. Their customer service is horrible too, it took 3 weeks to get a reply to an email and when you call the phone rings and then eventually hangs up, you can't even leave a message. I would advice to avoid this company at all costs. Luckily, I was able to find Tarte cosmetics and love them. I definitely prefer their "Powderful" pressed compact better. And of course, you can purchase Tarte on Amazon.	-1
I bought this product primarily because it won Allure magazine's best anti-aging product award.  I don't have wrinkles except for a tiny one by my right eyebrow, but I wanted to improve the texture of my skin.  The product comes in a package that is made to look like prescription medicine and warns you that this is an INTENSIVE treatment.  I thought that was gimmicky.  "Behold this powerful, life-changing elixir..."  Meh.  Still, I had hope.  I applied it daily as directed for many months.  There was no burning or stinging or anything that suggested it was "intensive," and sadly, NO change in my skin at all.  Not even a tiny bit. Even my one little wrinkle was exactly the same. I didn't give up earlier because I was determined to give it a fair shot.  I realize we don't all have the same skin, so what didn't work for me might work for you.  Just be aware that you could be wasting $50.	-1
I'm not one that is overly picky with accents, but these Jack Black face pads were unusable for me because of their odor. I have other Jack Black products, like Beard Lube, and love how it smells. However these peel pads smell almost like rose water, which is very off-putting for a man.  My wife agreed they smell lingered on my face after using.  Unfortunately I can't speak to their effectiveness, because I didn't use for longer than a week (3 applications).  On the plus side, they did not burn or irritate my skin (just offended my nose).	-1
This was not sealed when I opened it.  The product is not what I have bought in the past.  No tingly after effect after you put it on.  It is also yellowish and not white like the past so I don't know if it is old or what.  Disappointed.	-1
not the greatest color	-1
I tried this a few times and it made things worse. When you shake the Toppik powder, the key to getting it to look even slightly natural is to avoid clumping and dark streaks from too much in one area. When using this optimizer it bunches up at the edge of the tool and creates a stark line of dark color next to your scalp. This doesn't give the blended look you need and will call attention to your hairline.	-1
I wanted to get the whole TOPPIK gear.  The item however was not necessary for me.  I don't use it.	-1
Bought the Mia several years ago.  Initially, it was great and really cleaned my skin well.  I wear quite a bit of foundation, so I wiped that off first with a gentle cleanser, then followed with the Mia and the super-sensitive skin brush.  ThenUGH!  Pink mold on the spinner mechanism that would NOT clean off. I rhrew away that dirty thing. Have just ordered the Tao facial brush, which has a drying lightpromises to knock out all molds.  Well see.	-1
After reading a lot of hype about this, I caved and bought it. I can't believe that I spent so much money on a product that actually frustrates the heck out of my skin. If you have sensitive skin which is prone to breakouts, I couldn't recommend this in good faith. You know those exfoliants you can get at any drug store that have the plastic/synthetic "microbead" things? If you skin doesn't react well to those kinds of products, this might break you out as it did me. Little tiny bumps everywhere, not a pretty sight. If you have resilient, normal skin I can imagine that this would sort of buff it nicely. Sensitive skin? Too harsh in my book.	-1
I really don't know how well this works because there is so little in the container I really couldn't apply enough to give any kind of answer. This is a Sample rip off! I expect the samples to be small but honestly I had to try so hard to get as little as a dime out and this is one of the more expensive samples so I expected a good enough size to give me some idea of what the product works like. From now on I'll be more careful about how much is in the sample which was clearly listed on the site and product so this was partly my mistake.  Ordinarily I love La Roche-Posay products if that helps anyone, the sunscreens are the best but this product I have no idea.	-1
I went thru 2 whole tubes and found negligible effect, if any. My baby had contact dermatitis AND heat rash, and it did not relieve either, despite a professional recommendation. Granted, it did not EXACERBATE the condition, but it did not VISIBLY improve NOR soothe the itching. I also used it on diaper rash to no effect at all (it is a thin, water-based emulsion and thus wastefully absorbs right into the diaper vs an oil-based barrier cream.)  I would classify this as a neutral cream that is free of anything that would potentially irritate skin further, but that's it. This allows time for the skin to naturally heal itself which could allow some to feel it is working.	-1
I got such a poor lather that I did not even apply this to my face and risk DE shaving with it (my sensitive skin would hate me). I tried to whip a bowl lather with my badger hair brush -- the "lather" just dissipated. Second attempt: I did a simulated face lather on my hand using a pre soaked boar hair brush. I got a bit more lather, but I had to use about half of the 2 oz. sampler. The second lather also was not good enough that I would risk shaving with it. Thick, voluminous lathers are a must for my sensitive skin. This falls well short of expectations. The consistency of the cream out of the container is similar to that of Taylor of Old Bond Street. The difference is that Taylor's actually lathers. I will dispose of this product.	-1
Shave cremes need lather and a feeling of fullness. There should be a richness to the lather and one should not have to use too much of the product to achieve that. Products like The Art of Shaving (my personal favorite), Kiehl, and Lab all have excellent shave cremes that when applied with a brush give a sense of moisture that leads to a smooth shave. This Baxter product is inexplicably tepid. Even using alot of the creme on the brush, I never quite had a feeling of satisfaction with the richness of the lather. I had to use alot of the product to equal much less of the other three I have referred to. Now, I use a brush to apply the shave creme. Baxter shave creme was one of the most disappointing I have ever used.	-1
I wet shave every time. I've been using straight razors and safety razors (double edge) razors for years. I ordered this because their wasn't much to choose from this last time. I now wish I'd ordered a bag of cookies or something. This stuff is like a soft version of Noxzema. The smell is medicine like and the shave was not very comfortable or close, and it doesn't build a very good lather. I was going to throw it away, but my wife may give it a go on her legs in the shower. Don't waste your money on this. If you want a good shave go with Colonel Conk glycerin shave soap. It comes in several different, pleasant aromas, and gives a superior shave to any canned or tub type cremes. I almost feel violated after using this product, compared to what I'm used to. I prefer using "Edge" to this if you have to go the easy route. Nothing beats the lather you get from a quality shave soap once you learn the technique of how to build a good lather. This stuff took handfuls to get enough to get a less than adequate lather, and the shave was not close, and my face is raw, like I almost didn't use any lather. Might be a good cold creme for removing makeup on women, but it's lousy for removing a beard.	-1
I regularly shave with a shaving "lotion" rather than a shaving cream (canned kind that you see in grocery stores). I purchase mine at Trader Joe's. I actually, typically, shave in the shower so having the lotion in a tube is a benefit. Also the consistency of the lotion is further helpful in the shower. The Baxter product is quite nice, but is not really liquid enough to be used alone. Your face must be really wet and the cream is more the consistency of an aerated marshmallow fluff. It goes on well, but I found that I had to keep reapplying cream and water to keep the necessary slickness in order to shave. That said, with today's razors being multi-bladed, the Baxter's kind of clogged up the razor. I dislodged the blade several times tapping it against the sink in order to loosen the clogged blades.  It's a really good product, but not terrific packaging since you go into the tub like a pomade rather than a cream or lotion.	-1
Over the years I've used all kinds of shaving creams and foams and recently tried out Baxter of California Super Close Shave Formula. Years ago I switched from using Gillette products including foaming shave gels to a saftey razor system including a badger hair brush and a shaving cream called Proraso. I've been happily using Proraso for years but the only detraction to that product is that it is expensive.  After using Baxter's Super Close Shave Formula for a week my conclusion is that this product is simply not for me. The single biggest issue here is that this cream does not form a nice, rich lather for my shaves or much of any lather at all. Even using my Baxter branded badger hair brush this cream does not form any kind of lather. In order to get a decent shave I ended up having to use a tremendous amount of the shave cream. With Proraso a small, dime-sized dollop will lather up into a thick lather.  So while this may be marketed as a premium product, after using this cream I'm left to conclude that that's exactly what it is - marketing instead of substance.  Additionally this cream has a rather unpleasant medicated odor.  Not recommended.	-1
Broke before I took it anywhere.  I travel a lot and need a pressed that holds up.  Way overpriced for what you receive.	-1
Ok	-1
I had high hopes for this product but I haven't been so impressed. I use their blush and love the pigmentation and clever packaging. In this case I find the highlighter really hard to even discern on my olive/tan skin. I use a liquid highlighter otherwise and that adds the perfect highlight, whereas this just ends up as a smear if I add more. Not worth it- maybe it works well for light skin tones.	-1
I bought this via amazon and it arrived intact but immediately broke. It is similar to the benefit liquid luminizer, only in a powder form. i've used it some since it broke but ultimately it became too inconvenient and i threw it out. i was keeping it in a makeup bag in the bathroom when it happened, i must have put it down too heavily but regardless that's far too sensitive.	-1
it is a very strong floral scent, too strong. not spicy scent at all. it's like old 60's perfume scent my grandma had on.  It gave me a headache the moment I sprayed.  it lingers for a very long time.  It is definitely a whole day perfume strength.	-1
Terrible experience, once in a kind! It's been a month and still I don't get a simple hair treatment! By now I could have go to the store and buy it. Once I contacted the seller he said: Sorry it's shippied from overseas... Serioulsy? Then he should advertise: be sure you won't get the product in a month! I will never buy again from this seller, is not worth the wait!	-1
Not a huge fan.  Does not work nearly as well as traditional store items like Degree or Secret.  Smell was just ok.  Usually i am not a very stinky person and can get away with forgetting deodorant a day if I had not washed it off in shower.  This was NOT the product for that.	-1
This does not work for controlling odor at all.  It also has a strong fragrance.  This is an expensive choice for a deodorant.	-1
So now that I am pregnant I was looking for a deodorant that was less toxic and less perfumed than my normal deodorant. I waited 24 hours for my other deodorant to clear out of my pours. Took a good shower and scrubbed my armpits. I then applied the Vichy deodorant. It went on smooth like other deodorants and had no smell. But within hours I stunk. I reapplied to see if that would help but I still smelled. Since I wanted to give it a fair shot since my pregnancy hormones could be out of wack, I gave the product for my husband to try. The first day he said it seemed to work fine, but on the second day he said it was as if he wasn't even wearing anything. I figured his 24-hour order protectant deodorant probably was still working on day one. After a good attempt, neither one of use liked the product or felt that it worked for us.	-1
It's summer, so what better time to take a chance on a new deodorant?  The scent on this one is like baby powder multiplied.  I can be pretty sensitive to smells.  Strong scents especially perfumes or strong chemicals  are one of the few known triggers for my migraines and this one is bordering on trouble for me.  I didn't actually get a full on migraine but it did make a little nauseous and fearful for about the first hour after I applied it because it stayed really strong that long.  Because of the heat I did use it on a low activity day and it was fine for that.  But once I added in  a little exercise (walking and the simply fit board -- so nothing too demanding) I did start to smell hints of sweat mixed with baby powder.  I would only recommend this for people who either already don't sweat much or those who really like the baby powder scent or for really low activity days.  It's just not strong enough for the kinds of days where you really need protection and the protection is does offer is more of a masking of the sweat with an overpowering scent.	-1
It has been a long time since I have tried a roll on.  I think the last one I tried was an Avon brand if I recall.  Well I think I am going to stick to my dry sprays since I don't have to walk around with my arms in the air until my pits dry or leave a wet sticky feeling on my clothes.  It states it has a dry-touch feeling, but that has to be after it has completely dried because since it has no alcohol it will not dry quickly as other brands.  In regards to the body odor protection, I think the odor of the product is unpleasant on it's own.  It smelled okay sniffing it from the bottle, but once it made contact with my skin it was like the aroma changed for the worse.  Unfortunately this is not for me.  Hopefully it will work better for someone that has extreme skin problems and has to resort to this.	-1
Not very effective, and the smell is too strong (like baby powder, but worse).  Stick with Tom's of Maine.	-1
Personally, I prefer an antiperspirant in the summers here but do wear just deodorant in winter.  Since this was Vichy 24 hour Deodorant I thought I'd give it a try. I love Vichy products but really did not like this product at all. I did not notice it said it was for "light activity" until after I received it. I tried it on a day where all the activity  I did was work on the computer, do laundry and make dinner.  It failed miserably. Within 4 hours I was starting to feel  sweaty (even though this isn't an antiperspirant} and had some odor. Not even CLOSE to the 24hours listed on the labelThe 80 degree humid weather may have had something to do with it, but it shouldn't be so wimpy. For me, it was totally worthless and I threw it away.	-1
I was not impressed with this product. It has all the right buzzwords, paraben-free, aluminum-free, salt-free, but the bottom line for me is that while it glides on smooth it has a tacky, sticky feel. I cannot stand that in a deodorant. I've been pleased with other Vichy products I've tried, but I was very disappointed in this one. I would not recommend it.	-1
I usually like Vichy skincare products. I had expected the same level of quality in their deodorant, but this doesn't work for me at all.  While it is great that it is for sensitive skin, alcohol-free, Paraben-free, Aluminum-free and salt-free, the deodorant feels clammy and damp on the skin. At $17, it is expensive and doesn't keep me dry.  I prefer the Dove which has a dry powder feel and works without the need to reapply except on the worst heatwaves in NYC.	-1
Very cheap nail polish. It chips very easily.	-1
As someone who usually uses Secret clear gel, I was not a fan of this stick deodorant, as it neither seemed to control perspiration or odor.  The initial smell is astringent and, generally, unpleasant, couple with the fact it seems to have little effect, making this a hard pass.  I'd love to use a more natural deodorant/anti-perspirant product but it also has to work to make that worthwhile.	-1
I didn't like this product at all.  When applied, it felt like a soft balm which felt very nice, at first.  But after awhile I noticed that my underarms were very sticky.  Not only sticky to the touch but sticky when I moved my arms.  It feels very weird to have the skin under your arms sticking together.  And to top it off, it didn't control odor.  I showered before bed and applied this deodorant and woke up with smelly armpits.  And our bedroom is a very comfortable 65-67 degrees.  (It's late spring/early summer here and we sleep with the windows open so it's not like I'm sweating excessively while I  sleep.)	-1
I love Essie nail polish, but for some reason this one chips off very easily. Maybe it's the shimmer.	-1
it left the stain on my nails after removed...	-1
The first time using this polish and it is very thick and does not go on evenly. Won't let me return and I'm very disappointed. I won't be buying polish off Amazon again. I usually love Essie.	-1
Essie nail polish usually impresses me, but this polish does not last more than a couple days. I would be very surprised if it was real Essie.	-1
The brush is splayed out so i can't really use it. Just seems like cheap bristles or something?	-1
In person it's different then pic	-1
Not even close to same color shown here. It was actually dark pink/purple	-1
I was so excited to see Essie nail polish on amazon.... I thought I was ordering this barely purplish more reddish wine color as seen in the product pictures but it arrived as an undesired purple. I can't return it so I wasted $9 on this color that I will never wear. I want my money back. I always rave about Essie nail polish but this was a disappointment just because the photos aren't accurate. I guess I have to buy it in store from now on to be sure of the color.	-1
I love the color Like Linen but it's super runny. I've put on four coats and it still isn't a solid color on my nails..	-1
Extremely light!	-1
For some reason when i put this nail polish on it goes on with a matte finish and looks weird. I feel like when i bought it that it had been tampered with before. None of my other essie colors that i've bought from a store has done that.	-1
I bought 2 of these and I'm very disappointed. These cost the full price of an Essie polish so I expected it to be authentic... These are watered down fakes. I wish Amazon would do a better job of regulating this stuff:(	-1
Really disappointed.  Streaky, way too sheer, and hardly any color.  Not at all what I expected from the pictures.  Went straight in the garbage.	-1
It was NOT THE COLOR SHOWN NOR WHAT I expected...its a brown/gray	-1
It was watered down! It was a waste of my money	-1
The first coat was too thin and watery!	-1
Love Essie, however this color got very thick and dried out rather quickly. Only was able to use it twice. Not to happy	-1
it may be an old Essie nail polish because it chips and comes off too easily from nails	-1
Nice color but a little too light for me.  It has sparkles in it too, which I did not know.  U might like and u might not.	-1
Not as pretty as I had hoped.	-1
The polish I received looks nothing like the one shown for sale. It looks more similar to Essie's "Play Date." This was also the first time I've purchased nail polish online. Lesson learned: stick to purchasing polish in person.	-1
I love Essie nail polish...but this color itself is only SLIGHTLY different than "Butler, Please". I purchased this in the store, and it appeared more purple under the lights which was what I was looking for. I put on a layer of "Butler, Please" on one nail and this on the next one. BARELY any difference. Still a pretty color but just be aware that it is just like this color. Now I have two of the same basically.	-1
Product received promptly in a well cushioned envelope.  However quality of nail polish leads me to believe it is either extremely old or had been sitting for a long period of time in extreme temperatures.  Nail polish is extremely watery, not at all glossy even after 3 coats. It is not the quality I am used to when compared to other Essie nail polishes	-1
Polish chips very easily  Love the color.	-1
I'm a huge Essie fan and loved this color in the salon. Bought on Amazon and it was goopy and not the quality I've learned to expect. Something was off.	-1
First, the color shown here, which looks like a soft apricot, was actually a garish orange: my toes look like I am wearing orange peel! Second, as another reviewer mentioned, the polish goes on streaky, and it was only after much effort, and much time, that I was able to achieve some semblance of coverage.  I have never thrown out a polish, but this one I did. I think I will stick to Opi polishes, they have a better quality overall.  As for this Essie polish: COMPLETE FAIL, I hated it!!	-1
Too many coats have to be applied to get the color. I was disappointed when I had to keep reappling. Polish is very thin.	-1
I have had nothing but problems with this polish. It's streaky no matter how many coats or how much Seche top coat I use. It's super pretty and makes me sad that the formula is so crappy.	-1
I like wearing neutral color on my nails and I usually love Essie.  I went with this color to get some subtle glitter.  I was disappointed with the product.  It goes on with lots of streaks.  It needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish.  I stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it doesn't last as long.  The good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  I wore it for almost a week, so that's good.  I doubt that I would have been able to do it with 3 coats, but I will experiment.  It is a good color for the office, but I still wish that it was less "watery".	-1
Im use to Essie polishes being of better quality. I had to put on 3 coats to get an accurate color pay off.	-1
This is not the real thing. It's fake and a horrible one at that. If I could put zero stars I would. So disappointed.	-1
I don't know what colors the other reviewers are talking about but I bought Green, Shake your $$ Maker.  The color looks awesome in the bottle, but when you paint it on your nails it is a very translucent green.  As one reviewer said, it looks watery.  After three coats it still doesn't look right.  I always use a clear top coat and that doesn't help it from looking terribly matte as well.  Just beware, maybe other shades fare better.  I'm a huge Essie fan and it saddens me because this looks like such a great color and they currently do not offer anything close to it.  I have discontinued colors that are similar but don't have the punch that this one has.	-1
I really loved the color, and that's why I gave it one star. After I put the polish on, it was bubbly, it was very thick to put on, like polish does when it gets older, really disappointed since this was my first Essie polish purchase.	-1
2 coats and a topcoat and still it chipped.  Thought at this price it would be better quality polish but no!	-1
I was surprised to receive RED nailpolish. This picture is deceiving. I was expecting a pink color. It shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate.	-1
I am not a fan of this polish.  It has a relatively dull finish and take 3-4 coats to effectively coat the nail.  I would not recommend that other people purchase this polish.	-1
I saw this color and it looked beautiful, a very orange coral type color!!! But once you put it on it's like matte.... In a bad way ! It doesn't have the shine and beauty as other Essie nail polish have!! Very dissapointed	-1
You definitely need to add more than 2 coats. Super sheer and my nail shows through. I'd resell it if I could	-1
I so badly wanted to like this polish.  I am all about wearing pink in October, so I jumped all over this when Cut & Blow offered a good deal on it and its companion polish, Pink Works.  Imagine my disappointment when I tried to wear it last week.  This might be the worst formula polish I have EVER worked with.  Sheer but patchy, lots of dragging, and even after three thin, even (well, as even as I could manage), there were still unevenly-colored spots on my nails.  Such a disappointment.  If you're looking for a pretty pale pink shade - KEEP LOOKING!!	-1
The color does not come out like it is pictured until you apply about 4 coats. Who's got time for that.	-1
I guess I should have read the reviews before I ordered, this polish has absolutely no shine! It looks terrible, hate it!!!	-1
Ok to be clear I have to point out that the seller was great! I received the product early and it was packaged securely. The issue I have with this polish it that it NEVER DRIES. I love essie but the formula on this one is aweful. The color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle. BUT even with one coat (I tried it out just to see if it'd dry that way) it'll smudge as soon as you touch anything. The better buy would be sinful colors endless blue!! The colors are identical and the formula's great!	-1
I loved the color.  But this entire color line by Essie chips VERY FAST.  Even with a great top coat.  Fortunately it dries fast.  But I found myself having to redo my nails almost every day with all of the colors that I bought from this line.  Making me shy away from Essie for a while...	-1
I love this color (and many of Essie's colors), but the polish gets so many bubbles as it dries that it's unusable.	-1
I was excited to receive, but it is watered down and is not the real thing.  It came out matte and runny.  I was extremely disappointed.	-1
this nail polish, although Essie brand, is horrible quality. I don't know if it's the manufacturer or the distributor, but it went on like paint thinner, no shine, chipped after a day, very flat. I do not recommend.	-1
This is not really neon. You have to put 3 coats since it's sort of clear the first coat and streaky the second coat.	-1
It's a jelly formula which means it takes 6 coats or so to be opaque. I'm super disappointed!!!! I was so excited only to be extremely let down. Awful formula, do not buy. Even over white it just looked ugly and messy.	-1
This was not as purple as it looks here. If it were more cool toned gray I would have loved it too. This color is best on darker skin tones. It looked odd next to my fair skin.	-1
When applied, this looks horrible and watery...nothing like when purchased in a store. I would not recommend buying these online. Very disappointed.	-1
The pink color advertised is actually almost clear when you put it on your nails, no matter how many coats you put on. I mixed it with a white polish, which helped, but you shouldn't have to do that. Don't expect a solid color	-1
Even using it twice a day didn't make a tiny bit of difference, I would not recommend this product.	-1
I was excited to try this because I have a problem with red cheeks. I was hoping that this would make it where I didn't have to cover my red cheeks with makeup. However, as soon as I put it on my cheeks get much redder. After awhile my cheeks go back to their normal redness, but even after diligently using this for weeks, my cheeks are the same color red that they've been for the past two years. As excited as I was to try this, I ended up being very disappointed. It's also very expensive for a product that doesn't work. I don't recommend this.	-1
I've been using this for the past 4 days (both in the evenings and mornings) and every time it has made my skin looks redder with a slight burning feel.  I've decided to stop using it.	-1
Orange mask of a face is not my style.	-1
I LOVE TEXTURE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE But but but but - I am not sensitive skin type at all - never have been sensitive - but this burned my face. That cant be good. I am oily (that in itself is a protector) and I am tough skinned and yet this burned.  My face felt tight all day. Hard almost. I thought I found a Keeper but sadly no. Starting over!	-1
I really did not enjoy this sunscreen. It felt very heavy and thick on my face..I thought the look was pretty nice although I still had to powder over the top. The reason I hated it is because it broke me out over my entire face in little clogged pores which even now, two weeks later, are still about half present. It also gave me regular whitehead breakouts which went away after a few days of stopping use...but damn these clogged pores idk what to do now. I just have to wait it out. This is not the first time a coola product has broken me out, so I should have known better. For reference, I am oily, acne prone and sensitive.	-1
I wanted to love this as much as the Coola matte tinted spf 30 unscented.  I purchased this to use on the days I didn't want any color in my sunscreen.  Unfortunately, the matte cucumber is disappointing.  It doesn't absorb well into the skin, so skin is noticeably whitened.  Also, contents of the tube started clumping after using for about 2 weeks.  When I applied to my skin, I had clumps of the sunscreen that wouldn't absorb sticking to my face.  The texture is not the same as the tinted, unscented version...it's thinner and does not feel as nice on the skin.  The scent is not that noticeable.  This is not a negative for me, but if you are buying based on the scent, it's not that strong.  Love the brand, but cannot recommend this product.	-1
Unscented, Mineral sunscreen, One of six sunscreens recommended by allure magazine.  Active Ingredients Titanium Dioxide (Sunscreen) 3.2% Zinc Oxide (Sunscreen) 1.8%  Inactive Ingredients Aluminum Hydroxide, Butyrospermum Parkii (ORGANIC Shea Butter), Cucumis Sativus (ORGANIC Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Glycerin (ORGANIC), Hydrogen Dimethicone, Iron Oxides, Isopropyl Myristate, Isopropyl Titianium Triisostearate, Linum Usitatissimum (ORGANIC Linseed) Seed Oil, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (ORGANIC Evening Primrose) Oil, Plankton Extract, Polyamide-5, Polysilicone-11, Propylene Carbonate, Rosa Canina (ORGANIC) Fruit Oil, Silica Silylate, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Synthetic Wax.  allure's article claims; allure 6 Sunscreen Solutions...Coola Costing $40 for 1.7oz, you are putting synthetic wax on your skin. Now I checked sunscreens in a tube not spray, 97% organic with 18% zinc, the best protection which costs five times less than Coola with less than a handful of ingredients in the mix unlike Coola which has how many ingredients... wow, close to thirty, amazing.  Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.  SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin's DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.  I make my own sunscreen as well as I purchase sunscreen for times when I do not have time to make any since I need to surf. For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection. The more zinc, the more protection but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to EVCO. Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun. For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high zinc oxide is the best solution. A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful ingredients, certified organic at least 95% and FREE OF; fragrances, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, or UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane.	-1
Works well but smells terrible.	-1
Two stars might make the reader believe this is a bad product, but it isn't. The VINCENT LONGO Olive Oil Fix Tip Makeup Remover is actually a very nice product. However, it has several drawbacks. First, the tube contains about - maybe, I don't know - maybe a teaspoon and a half of an "olive oil product" - I'd rather use pure olive oil than some olive oil mixed with chemicals (see label photo). The product itself does a very good job at removing makeup mistakes without disturbing much surrounding area. However, is this product worth $20? Absolutely not. As I stated . . . it's a tiny amount of oil, a fixed, stationary applicator, and a dozen extra swabs (overproduced, glorified Q-tips). The in-tube applicator defies explanation; if one is expected to dispose of the provided tips, not re-immerse them in the oil, it seems that providing the attached applicator is counter-intuitive. Its use would contaminate the oil, so why is it there? Also, immersing a disposable tip in the tube this morning, I managed to dislodge the white cap, which could create an oily disaster in someone's purse if the tip remained dislodged inadvertently. Yes, this product does the trick. But so do a host of other things, including water on a Q-tip. So why pay $20 for what is basically frou frou?	-1
Olive oil fix tip, well named as it is just that, a small vile of olive oil, 12 plastic disposable wands, with a sticker on the wands that state..Made in China!  You could probably do much better in a dollar store, as you could get a zillion plastic makeup wands for a dollar. Also a small vile from a pack of 100, fill the small vile with olive oil and bingo! For under $4.00 you have your very own Precision Makeup Remover ..Olive Oil Quick Fix. This product list on Amazon for $20.00.  Gee z zoo ...People will buy any thing! As I hate to leave a negative ending to this review, I can honestly say, without any guilt ....it does correct makeup mistakes.  So the product is not all a joke. Cannot recommend this product.	-1
A waste of money. Basically u get a vial and a few applicators. The oil based fixer is relative ineffective and obviously greasy. The applicators are rough for the tender under eye area and you have to press relatively hard to get under eye smudge cleaned up, especially with a black eyeliner smudge	-1
It does work as described.  It takes off even the toughest mascara and eyeliner.  Unfortunately, it replaces the stuck-on-makeup with stuck-on-oily-gunk.  I guess if I used this and then washed my face with a washcloth before bed, it would be OK... however, I could never use this to "fix" a makeup mistake and head out the door.  The feeling of this on my eyes/face is too gross for me to leave the house with.	-1
For the past several months, I have been using the Elf Makeup Remover Pen ($3 on the Elf website, twice that here on Amazon) to fix makeup mistakes, so I was curious how this much more expensive Vincent Longo product ($20 on Amazon) would perform in comparison. The answer for me was: not very well.  This product page for the Vincent Longo Olive Oil Fix Tip Makeup Remover states:  "Quick-fix solution for minor makeup mishaps. Nourishing olive oil based formula allows precision removal without having to reapply your whole face. Makeup can be immediately reapplied on area after use without further cleansing."  Here are my thoughts on those claims after using this product:  1) It is NOT a quick fix because of the oil residue left behind. 2) It does NOT provide precision removal when compared with the Elf product. 3) Makeup CANNOT immediately be reapplied without further cleansing.  When you use even just the tip of the doefoot applicator (a lip gloss-type applicator) to remove a makeup mistake, it leaves behind a slick of oil on your skin. The first time I used it to repair an eye shadow mistake on the outer edge of both eyelids, I did not realize it had left behind a greasy patch, so I went on to my volunteer job. When I got home, I was horrified to find that my eye shadow, near where I had used this product, was horribly smeared, creased and worn off. This is something that never happens to me normally as I wear a primer.  The next time I tried this product, I knew this time to wipe the oil slick off my skin before finished repairing my makeup and left the house. That day, my makeup wasn't impacted nearly as much. BUT the product claims that I should be able to "immediately reapply" my makeup "without further cleansing" and that just simply IS NOT TRUE.  Further, this little tube of olive oil and chemicals is overpriced at twenty dollars. I could use the olive oil in my kitchen on a Q-tip and skip the chemicals if I wanted to deal with having an oil slick on my skin.  No thanks. I will stick with my 3-dollar Elf Makeup Remover Pen.  Not Recommended.	-1
Most people who are used to getting their shaving cream from an aerosol can would not call this a shaving cream. It is closer to an old fashioned shaving soap that requires you to work up a lather with a shaving brush. Not owning a shaving brush, I found that it required quite a bit of the product (about 2  inches out of the tube) to cover my face, so I would not expect the tube to last a very long time.  Although it looked reminiscent of shaving from a bar of soap, on those times when I traveled someplace without shaving cream, the oils in CADE allowed for a smooth, close shave. While the scent is not unpleasant, I do not like scented shave creams, and I would not buy this product again.	-1
I was interested in this product because it says "for all hair types" and I wondered if it would make my medium fine hair more under control and healthier looking especially during muggy, windy or very dry days.  the oil has a scent that is pleasant but a little too strong for me.  I put it on very conservatively as directed, blow dried my hair as usual and my hair looked limp (but shiny!).  My guess is this would work well for curly, coarse, or maybe even thick straight hair.  It is just not for fine and straight. .	-1
LiftActiv Eye is an anti-aging eye care developed for use on all the delicate areas around the eye, including the eye lid. Visibly lifts the eye lid, reduces the appearance of wrinkles, depuffs the look of under eye bags, and minimizes dark circles. Well, I wish all that were true, but unfortunately this was not the case for me.  Now, when I got up in the morning, my eyes were definitely smoother looking and the under eye skin looked more plump but as soon as I washed my face, back came the dark under eye circles and wrinkles.  I used it in the morning before I put on my makeup and it made no difference in the dark circles at all.  My entire eye area has not changed one bit.  Only at night when I first applied it and kept it on did I notice a more smooth under eye.  I think at my age as I am in my fifties, you just need surgery or botox.  Any eye cream I have used doesn't give me any lasting results.  For the price, I would be like to see reduced wrinkles and minimized dark circles.  I think I will be happy using something a bit cheaper.  This is pretty pricey for a eye cream that really did nothing,	-1
I hate to dislike a free product so much, but I really dislike this eye cream.  First off, it smells like latex paint which really is off-putting to me.  I am interested in natural and this brand touts itself as natural and healthy, so why does this smell like latex paint?  I really dislike that.  Secondly, when it put it on the area that has crow's feet wrinkles, it stung a bit.  I could feel it tightening the skin, but it felt like too much acid or something - definitely irritated my skin.  Thankfully my skin didn't get red.  I actually didn't see any difference, I only felt it..  I really don't tolerate this eye cream well at all.  Which is a shame, because I was super excited at the prospect of a free high end eye cream.  Back to Caudalie for me.	-1
I could easily overlook the Pine-Sol-ish top note of this at first application, because it wears off in about 15 minutes. But what replaces it is a vaguely grassy chemical scent with no depth or subtlety. And it only lasts a couple hours, so by the end of the day it disappears without a trace. Kind of reminds me of the old joke: One old lady says to another, "The food at this place is disgusting!" and the other replies, "Yes, and such small portions!"  Incidentally, since this is allegedly a man's scent I had my husband try this out a couple times for my enjoyment -- though it turns out I didn't enjoy it, and neither did he. And I (a woman) tried it myself a couple times, since I find many grassy, woodsy scents work for me. No dice. Unfortunately, this is a miss for Varvatos.	-1
Doesn't help my hair, I have hard time comb my hair after rinsing this and smell is unbearable! Hate it!	-1
In order to give a fair review, I've used this consistently for six weeks. I have seen no visible difference in acne or dryness. All in all, it's been a waste of time.  I would not recommend spending your money on this product.	-1
For the price, I would expect to get the results that are promised. I have been using this for about 3 and a half weeks now. Ok, so I know the pictures so a big improvement at 12 weeks but still at this point I should have seen results. I get the tingling but I am not really seeing a decrease in winkles or smoother skin. I read a few other people start that it seemed this product was diluted solution from what you got from the actual company website, so this might be part of it. Yet, others have also said they haven't seen results either. A lot for nothing.	-1
This product is not what I consider a "serum" because it is the consistency of water. It basically makes it impossible to apply the product to your face.  To me a serum is thicker in consistency, not thin and watery.  I can't comment on whether the product performs as promised because I could not use the product without spilling it everywhere.  It was just too much trouble.	-1
***UPDATE*** After about a month of use, my husband bumped his backside against something at work while the comb was in his back pocket.  All the teeth at the point of impact BROKE leaving about a 1" gap, rendering it totally useless.  His dollar store comb held up for years under similar conditions and never had one tooth break.  I'm afraid I have to rescind my earlier review and I do not recommend this product unless you're going to keep it in a drawer-or maybe have a metal sheath in your pocket.  *PRELIMINARY REVIEW WHICH I HAVE TO RETRACT* This Baxter comb comes in its own little box, printed with little blurb about the hand crafted care that goes into it's manufacture.  It is light weight and flexible so as not to break in your back pocket.  My husband says this comb is noticeably nicer than the dime store one he's been using for years.  He says the teeth feel smooth on his scalp and glide nicely thorough his hair, though I fear there may be more words in this review than there are hairs on his head these days....	-1
This is a super fine glitter polish. By superfine, I mean it makes flat polish shimmery. I bought it with hopes of doing a glitter fade manicure, but it is way too fine to show up. I initially put it over cream puff, but it was barely visible, even in the sunlight. In the end, I used regular glitter and a half empty bottle of old shellac top coat to achieve the actual glitter look I was going for. If you are looking for something to make your existing flat shellac colors shimmery, this is your product. If not, you are better off making your own with a bottle of top coat and some glitter.	-1
I have the another Baxter product, the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Clay-Mask/dp/B000VBO0CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Clay Mask</a>, which I like, and since I like to try different soaps and shampoos, I figured I'd try this body wash. Upon selection, the floral scent seemed the least "scenty," but after trying it's not very mild in my opinion. The body wash does it's job like any good body wash does, but the lingering scent is too much for me. It may not bother some, but I'm moving on to other options. If Baxter has an unscented wash, that could be intriguing.  Also, just something I noticed... in the Amazon product description it says "Dehydrated skin produces excess oil, resulting in irritation and breakouts." You know what else irritates the skin though? Scented soaps.	-1
Nah	-1
but I gave it only one star because I haven't actually tried it, but I want everyone to be aware of one of Amazon's vendors. I placed on order for it on Jan 2nd and never received it from the shipper (My Beauty Products)! They finally refunded my money on January 24th, but kept the shipping charges that I had paid. Upon reading some of their other reviews, I noticed that other people had the same problem with them. Guess those shipping charges can add up to a chunk of change after awhile. When I spoke with customer service for My Beauty Products, they were very rude and made fun of me. Not only do they have poor taste, they are also cheating people!	-1
Nope. I try a lot of hair products and I hated this stuff. It made my scalp itch like crazy, and it make my hair feel stiff and weird. A waste of money in my opinion.	-1
My first experience with this product was when my stylist used it to puff up my short hair and give it some nice volume.  It worked brilliantly.  It makes your hair full-looking, not greasy or unwashed.  One caution, though.  It is made of propylene glycol, which the CDC lists as a toxic substance.  It is a "synthetic liquid substance that absorbs water" and has ill effect on your skin, kidneys, nose and lungs.  Link here: [...]  Knowing this, I don't think it would be a good idea to use this product in the future.  Use at your own risk.  Shipping caution: I ordered it from Spasourceonline, an Amazon-fulfilled retailer.  The amazon box I opened was full of white powder; the product was not well-wrapped and the top came unscrewed in transit.  So buyer beware.  Because of this, Amazon refunded my product price and shipping.  So yay Amazon.	-1
I like Big Sexy Hair products but this one doesn't work for me so well. It lifts up roots a bit, but makes hair sticky and greasy looking. I have excellent results with Ojon dry shampoo-volume and clean looking hair when no time to wash. This powder didn't give me even half of Ojon volume. This powder works better for me as a separator of hair chunks, but overall I will not repurchase and I don't really need that.	-1
Very cheap nail polish. It chips very easily.	-1
I love Essie nail polish, but for some reason this one chips off very easily. Maybe it's the shimmer.	-1
it left the stain on my nails after removed...	-1
The first time using this polish and it is very thick and does not go on evenly. Won't let me return and I'm very disappointed. I won't be buying polish off Amazon again. I usually love Essie.	-1
Essie nail polish usually impresses me, but this polish does not last more than a couple days. I would be very surprised if it was real Essie.	-1
The brush is splayed out so i can't really use it. Just seems like cheap bristles or something?	-1
In person it's different then pic	-1
Not even close to same color shown here. It was actually dark pink/purple	-1
I was so excited to see Essie nail polish on amazon.... I thought I was ordering this barely purplish more reddish wine color as seen in the product pictures but it arrived as an undesired purple. I can't return it so I wasted $9 on this color that I will never wear. I want my money back. I always rave about Essie nail polish but this was a disappointment just because the photos aren't accurate. I guess I have to buy it in store from now on to be sure of the color.	-1
I love the color Like Linen but it's super runny. I've put on four coats and it still isn't a solid color on my nails..	-1
Extremely light!	-1
For some reason when i put this nail polish on it goes on with a matte finish and looks weird. I feel like when i bought it that it had been tampered with before. None of my other essie colors that i've bought from a store has done that.	-1
I bought 2 of these and I'm very disappointed. These cost the full price of an Essie polish so I expected it to be authentic... These are watered down fakes. I wish Amazon would do a better job of regulating this stuff:(	-1
Really disappointed.  Streaky, way too sheer, and hardly any color.  Not at all what I expected from the pictures.  Went straight in the garbage.	-1
It was NOT THE COLOR SHOWN NOR WHAT I expected...its a brown/gray	-1
It was watered down! It was a waste of my money	-1
The first coat was too thin and watery!	-1
Love Essie, however this color got very thick and dried out rather quickly. Only was able to use it twice. Not to happy	-1
it may be an old Essie nail polish because it chips and comes off too easily from nails	-1
