I used this for extra cable to go from my NMO mount to my amplifier for my amateur radio.  Good product especially for those Hams and the truck mount NMO antenna mounts.	1
Excellent quality and workmanship.  Made in USA!!!! Components seemed high quality and cable was sealed professionally. They perform great as far as I can tell.  I use them on my BAOFENG UV-5R  and they fit perfectly.  Slightly higher price than some others , but well worth it. excellent service and delivery.  BUY!!! Buy!!!  Buy111	1
You can not get a better product for the money.	1
Reliable quality cable, connectors and manufacture.  ...made in US too - no oriental cable here!  Bonus!	1
Very good quality, thanks, I love this item very much.	1
Works as advertised, I'm using it with a small mobile radio and a small amount antenna.	1
Great build quality, fast shipping, and a wealth of written info providing warranty, service, etc. Made in USA. Dig it.	1
This is a good adapter cable for radios that use the SMA-F connector. You never want to put the adapter right on the SMA-F itself as it is not the strongest such input and the strain from the coax coming directly off of the adapter will break it. you are better off with an adapter such as this who's short coax cable run takes the strain off the the radio you are using. Be sure to purchase a UHF Female Female Barrel Adaptor SO239, available here on Amazon, so you can connect you HT to the external antenna you will be using.	1
These cables are made the way things used to be before every thing came from that big country in the far east.  Reason is they are made here in the USA.  Go figure!	1
used on Baoefeng 2 band radio  to 11 meter ( CB ) ant. worked good to receive , didn't try transmit	1
Exactly as advertised.  Good value.	1
I bought this for nursing school, it works great, pressures up fast and is easy. I also received this super fast. I would recommend that anyone who needed one of these got this one	1
Decent cuff for a fair price	1
Satisfied, Meeting our requirements.	1
If you are taking your own blood pressure cuff I highly recommend getting a D-Ring Cuff as it makes it much easier.  This cuff doesn't seem to be as high quality as my old cuff, but it also costs less and so far it's getting the job done.	1
Needed a BP cuff for my wilderness medical kit. A while ago my previous unit was shown to be too small to fit over the arm, of a barely muscular guy. This one is probably big enough to fit around a thigh (if you need to take femoral BP) of a smaller person, and easily fits bigger arms, yet I can also easily use it taking care of my elderly mother.  It comes with a nice compact vinyl case, that while it takes a few seconds to stuff back in the bag, fits neatly inside my pack, and keeps the cuff dry when the rest of my gear gets wet.  If you're starting out, taking your EMT course, this is a durable starter cuff that will get you through class, and probably last for many years after that.	1
I bought 2 of these 25' hoses.  I use one for back flushing our motorhomes black water tank and the other for washing our cars.  They work great and when your done, they do not take up a lot of space.	1
Why didn't I listen to previous buyers.  This is a true POS.  It broke at the joint on  the second use ANY I could not get my money back or a replacement because I did not use this quick enough.  What a rip-off.  the concept  is excellent but the execution  sucks.	-1
The hose was lightweight and expanded to full length with water pressure. The elastic nature of the hose kept a little water pressure after water was turned off so be careful not to remove nozzle without releasing water first or you will get soaked. The hose dispelled all the water automatically fastest when both ends are open. I was surprised to see all the bad reviews, the only cons I've seen were the fabric exterior just didn't seem like it should be dragged through mud. A regular hose would rinse more easily. I've even left it pressurized for several days and noticed no leaks. I'm writing this review as I'm about to purchase another 50'. I've used it several times but never abused it fully with tugging, vehicles etc. This hose wouldn't work well with a reel i imagine, the reel would restrict expansion and contraction limiting water flow. I'm surprised there was no mention of that in the description/ instructions. I don't like having to disconnect the hose every time im finished with it, even though it shrinks considerably, lying on the floor by the spigot just dosen't appeal to me  Edit to my review: neighborhood kids had a water fight in my driveway and popped the hose by trying to kink it to cut off the water supply	1
Even with the DAP name, this is a piece of junk that leaks. Save your money or put it towards a REAL hose.	-1
Reviews are terrible.  I've had no problems.  Maybe it's a matter of time.  But I still say 'do' it - for gentler applications.	1

I LOVE THIS  IT WORKS GREAT AND EVBEN THE SPRAYER NOZZLE THEY INCLUDE EVEN THOUGH SIMPLE IS SO GREAT  I LOVE THAT IT GETS SMALLER AS I EMPTY WATER OUT THANSK	1
works better than my buddy's fancy set. Worth every penny!	1
It seems to work great when you are testing it on short wires on the bench, but when you actually want to trace a mystery wire through a wall it lacks power or sensitivity to get the job done. I have tried it several times on different wires that I needed to locate and was never actually able to get a tone on the far end, even after I figured out which wire it was using other means. This is one of those tools that when you need it, you really need it, so it is frustrating to have it fail on you. I would buy a better one.	-1
For its intended use, it works great. We often see complaints about products such as this but my experience has been these issues result from the user not understanding the equipment's function, therefore its limitations.	1
works perfect, but not a heavy duty unit. For the home repair dude only..	1
*** WARNING! Before start your troubleshooting, Please turn off the MAIN BREAKER to be safe. ***  What a great tool to trace an open wire!  My wife blew up part of the house power, I check the breaker, not tripped breaker, what the heck? Where is the problem? No idea!  In the attic, there are wires all over.  What a mess! This tool to the rescue.  Connect the red to the HOT wire, the black to the ground wire, and trace the signal! Bingo!  Wow! Problem solved.  Made in China, but that t will end soon, today we have a new President!	1
This is a great bargain at 1/3 of the price of a fluke pro 3000.  However, you do get a lesser quality device.  The Fluke pro 3000 has better connectors to hook up to all kinds of wires.  The Fluke tracer also has a convenient push button instead of a dial so you don't use as much of your battery when in use.  I have both devices, and I use the Fluke whenever I have the choice.  If you're going to use this device regularly, get the Fluke.  If you need one as a home electronic hobby, save yourself the 50 bucks and buy the extech.	1
The Extech TG20 Wire Tacer/Tone Generator is a must have for all those working with wire or even for simple around the house projects.  This item has worked very well and always been reliable.  It has also featured a very dependable battery life which is a great bonus knowing that when you pull it from your tool bag it is ready to go.  It is made of plastic but has held up well to the bumps and bangs of the side of a tool bag so I am qutie impressed with its strength and functionality.  I would certainly recommend this product to others.	1
Perfect tool for tracking down some mystery breakers in our new house.	1
This tool is so convenient, I was able to track a faulty car alarm wire on my friend's car. We tracked the wire to the point it was pinched and was able to do the repair in no time at all. It picked up the signal through the metal panels and carpet with no problems. I love tools like this, I had no need for it at the time I bought it but it saved so much time when we did need it.	1
Great quality. Good price. Shipped fast. Happy buyer.	1
did not work on tracing an open wire,in house a/c line	-1
Works as advertised.  At first I tried just hooking it up without reading the instructions and experienced what some other people where saying in the reviews that the volume of the tracer wand was almost inaudible.  However, you have to know if the wire you are tracing is terminated or un-terminated, need to connect the tone generator to the appropriate wire and ground, and also need to have the tone generator on the correct setting.  Once I actually read the manual, it was quite easy to figure out what was going on, and I had no issues tracing a 12/3 wire from the garage up to the first floor light switches.  No problem through 3/4 inch drywall, strong signal detected.  Mare sure there is no power to the wires your are tracing before hooking this up.  Solved a 6 year mystery of what that switch is connected to in the basement!	1
as advertised happy with purchase	1
Works really Dang good- I am reworking the wiring in a RV and It has 110 and 12 volt in it. The prior owners cut a lot of wires and I had no clue where they went to. So I bought this. At Hdepot the unot was 69.95 and that was too much. I had the red wire tracker and it was crap and died. This was loud and sensitive. I just didn't care for that they took 9volt batteries. I like AA Or AAA.	1
I've owned other battery operated toothbrushes, but none were on a par with this Panasonic.  The after feel of brushing with the EW-DL91 is complete freshness and cleanliness.  Combined with my WaterPik, my mouth and teeth have never felt so clean.  It does come with a "waterpik" tool that I don't use because of my own unit, but the bristle and plastic brushes do a fantastic job.  It is pricey, so it probably is not for everyone or for a whole family, but if you have the money and desire to have a top-notch electric toothbrush, this should be your choice.	1
Nice wide vinyl tape, easily seen during day, adhesive seems aggressive and water resistant. Wider than typical electrician tape, more the width of duct tape. Unable to determine flexibility in extreme cold but seems on a par with temperature tolerance with other vinyl tapes. May not have heat or voltage resistance of electrician tape; packaging did not provide that information.  Useful for boundary markers, safety on change of planes, tool handles for recognition. Would be a five star product if I knew the specs for heat and voltage + had any reflectivity.	1
3M's tape is not exactly 'cheap' but it's extremely versatile. Yes, you can use it as masking tape and it can easily replace duct tape but there are so many possibilities.  We used it to mar a 'car' in our driveway as one of my kids is practicing parallel parking for his driver's licence exam. It worked great because we didn't have to wait for 'the weekend' to try it out at the school's parking lot and we could start with tape only before he was ready for the cones. Once his instructor agreed that he should pass the parallel parking challenge, we could remove the take quickly and cleanly. There was no trace of it ever been there.	1
This tape by 3M is a blinding yellow color so it's perfect for uses where high visibility is crucial. Even though it is not a reflective tape, it's very bright even with minimal light.  It's 2 inches wide and comes in a 36 yard roll. It looks and feels like plain old electrical tape, but the adhesive is much stronger (hence the price). 3M says it is perfect for floor applications because it is so durable, but the adhesive comes up cleanly when removed, without leaving a sticky mess to be removed.  I placed it on the edge of each wooden step leading down to the basement. Since the washer/dryer is there, we are often going down those stairs with a load of laundry obscuring the full view. This tape really does make a difference. I also applied it to the tiny, 1.5" step up at the side door. NOTE: It is not textured like the non-slip tapes that are often applied to stairs and ramps. This is strictly to provide a visual marking of potentially hazardous areas.  Finally, I wrapped it around the handles of my tools. I keep a couple of tool kits stocked with my most loved tools and somehow, I keep finding them in other places. I'm hoping that the bright yellow handles will encourage borrowers to return them to my tool box. (The tape also increases the non-slip "gripability" of the handles.)  I think practically every home could find a use for this tape, but since the price is considerable, I would recommend it more for marking serious hazards.	1
I suppose if you need it, you need it. Think of this tape like 2-inch-wide, bright yellow high quality electrical tape. It's made of the same vinyl stuff, and feels the same. No idea whether it has the same great electrical properties (it isn't intended for that purpose). But it does a great job marking things. If you would like something like this, but are on a tight budget, look at 3M's other *VERY* similar tape that's marketed as a general purpose tape:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/3M-General-Purpose-Vinyl-Tape-764-Yellow-2-in-x-36-yd-5-0-mil-Pack-of-1/dp/B000LDPX7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">3M General Purpose Vinyl Tape 764 Yellow, 2 in x 36 yd 5.0 mil (Pack of 1)</a>. It's very similar, and at the moment it's six times cheaper! There's even a three-inch-wide option if desired, still far less expensive than this product.	1
3M vinyl tape 471 is one of those products that shouldn't be exciting, but is.  I used it for floor marking, and it is obvious that the engineers thought carefully about every detail.  The most fundamental thing that tape must get right is being sticky, and 471 is.  It easily goes down and stays there.  The edges do not quickly fray or pull up when being walked on.  It is practically like a thin layer of vinyl flooring.  Another measure of quality is durability.  Again, the 471 comes through.  It isn't bulletproof, but standard foot traffic is no problem for it.  Finally, how does is peel off?  Easily, and surprisingly without residue.  I officially have nothing to complain about.  The only question is if 36 yards of tape is worth the asking price, regardless of how nice it is.	1
You need to be careful regarding which 3M 471 tape you order depending on your purpose. I'm using it to mask contrasting color areas and non-skid areas in painting a fiberglass boat. The 471+ tape is more purple than blue in color and has a very aggressive adhesive which when used for masking can lift underlying paint even if it has been curing for some time. However, it is quite flexible, useful for masking oddball curves that you can't make with a circle cutter. I use the 1/8" width for that. The narrow width conforms easily and the strong adhesive allows the tape to stick well when bent and stretched to tight curves. For straighter runs where wider coverage is needed and where I can form curves with a circle cutter I use plain blue 471 in 1/4" to 3" widths. My experience is that (no '+' in the model number) 471 has a gentler, but effective, adhesive that is less likely to lift paint and leaves no adhesive residue on removal even when left in place for extended periods.	1
This stuff works well but is pricey.  It is particularly good about NOT leaving residue when being removed.	1
Very pleased	1
I wouldn't think there would be a whole lot to say about a roll of tape but as far as tape goes this one really blew me away!  This tape is pricey for a reason: It's extremely durable, sticks to virtually any surface, and peels up without leaving any residue. The yellow color is great for visibility and writing on it with a Sharpie is easy and does not smudge. This tape actually reminds me a lot of electrical tape in its composition (it has a stretching quality to it which allows for some flexibility and a snug fit where necessary).  When I ordered this tape I thought no way could a roll of tape be good enough to justify this price but I have since been convinced otherwise. Excellent product!	1
I'm glad that this tape, which is more expensive than most products, lets you buy just one roll at a time instead of a bundle. This product is great for marking off territory for an event or project and adheres nicely to those types of services. It stretches nicely like the black electrical tape and also contours slightly though not quite as well.  Very handy when you need it, but the price may make it a bit cost prohibitive for most potential users.	1
If you have one of those areas at your job-site/workplace where you have a sign posted that states "watch your step", this tape is exactly what you need. By the time most people have read the sign, they've also stubbed their foot on the raised surface. Using this bright tape to mark these areas can add a much more effective signal for people to notice when going through.  While it's not nearly as sticky as something like duct tape, it's still grips onto concrete floors and a such effectively. Just be sure to sweep the area your taping thoroughly, since lots of dust/dirt can prevent the tape from sticking as well. Because it's not as sticky as duct tape, it means you can also pull it up when you want to. Duct tape, after it's been exposed to the heat from sunlight and had people walking all over it, tends to leave a messy residue behind. Once you get one end of this tape started peeled up, you can get the rest of it to come up cleanly.  Not only is this a nice tape for marking raised surfaces, it's also great for putting on the edge of steps to make them more visible. The yellow makes seeing the end of each step easier, especially in dark areas like building stairwells. Anywhere you need to mark to make something more visible, this tape can handle.	1
This reminds me of electrical tape in that it can be stretched if you pull on it and it almost molds itself to the surface upon which it is applied.  It has a bright color which can't be missed. It is easy to cut with a scissor but can be hard to tear with my hands because of the way it stretches.  I have used the tape on wood floors, wood paneling and tile floors and it has not left any marks. I have also used it on two wooden rake handles to give me something to grasp instead of the wood which has gotten warn over time. The tape molded itself to the handles and seems to be holding fine.  I look forward to finding other uses for this tape. It seems to work great.	1
We use a bunch of this stuff in varying widths and colors.  Lots of blue and white.  Nice to have the yellow - it is strong and sticky, yet removable from hard surfaces with no adhesive residue.  Great for marking tools, lanes and storage locations on terrazzo or tile floor.  Adhesive is oil resistant for relatively short periods.  One of the best things about 3M products is you can get all the exact technical details from their web site.	1
I am using this to mark my garden tools.  The bright color has made it much easier for me to find the smaller tools when I forget where I leave them in my garden.  The tape is easy to apply - it does not seem to fold over itself like some duct tape, so I can easily wrap it around without it getting stuck to itself.  It is good stuff.	1
Kids just love the patterned duct tape for various projects, and this is a very nice alternative. Bright yellow, was used for a bumblebee. Not as much tack but very easy to work with.	1
I'm not sure how one tape can be all things but this one seems to do it. It's like a cross between electrical tape, painter's tape and duct tape. Although it is not as strong as reinforced duct tape, it holds together really well. I've used it on an electrical cord and it holds fast. I've used it to tape off edges for painting and it stays on while working and comes off easily when done.  It is bright yellow and great for visibility (but not for hiding fixes).  It tears very easily with fingers and doesn't distort on the tear lines.	1
This is a specialty tape. What this tape can do is a combination of features. It is highly visible and will stay that way for quite a long time. Great for marking spots on the pavings for parking and even works great for auditorium stages where people are marked to stand. It is highly elastic that it conforms readily to any curve you stick it to. It also work like a gaffer tape that it is sticks well yet leave no residue when it is time for removal.	1
I used this tape to mark up our concrete garage floor to delineate parking spaces. The glossy yellow turned out to be highly visible/reflective even when driving in at night; and the tape has held out well, in this role, for over a week now. It is rated at 40 degrees and above, so I'm not sure how it will handle Minnesota winters - but so far, so good.	1
This safety-yellow vinyl marking tape from 3M is the industry standard for marking gymnasium floors, delineating storage areas and sight lines back stage, creating hazard warnings in the workplace, or providing continuous pathway signage.  It's a thick 5.2 mils and 2 inches wide in a 36 yard roll. The adhesive is top-quality and adheres under heavy usage and a wide range of temperatures.	1
This vinyl tape is as bright as the photo shows, and it's very, very sturdy.  This won't be a tape you can tear with your hands and teeth.  You'll need something sharp like scissors or a knife.  It's described as being ideal for "lane and safety markings, color coding, abrasion protection, masking, sealing, splicing, and other general purpose applications."  What we've used it for, thus far, is Splicing, Abrasion Protection, and Safety Markings.  For splicing it was perfect.  It's strong and tough enough that we won't be worrying about abrasions.  One example is our hot water heater disaster.  Our Sears heater which we only bought 4 years ago sprung a leak.  We turned off the water but wanted to drain off the excess.  Using this tape and a hose we were able to jury-rig a connection.  I made the mistake of testing the tape as a Safety Marking on an outside step** --which it's not suitable for.  Much to my surprise the tape stuck to the rough concrete.  And it stayed there despite the traffic in and out. But what it didn't do was hold up to rain.  In retrospect, I realize that the tape was meant for indoor use only.  So I'm not taking away any Stars, only passing on this information to you, in case you were imagining an outdoor usage.  **One of the things I was concerned in using this tape on the edge of a step was that it might be slick and cause someone's heel to skid. We found that it was NOT slick, and in fact provided good surface.  For your specialty uses, this is a great product.	1
This is a great tape for marking things that you want people to notice.  Such as a slight step, trip hazard or other caution areas that you want to highlight.  The tape is very easy to apply and really sticks to the area.  It also doesnt really leave any residue like some tapes if you have to remove it.  Overall a good tape for marking areas that you want people to notice.	1
This is a versatile tape, useful for a number of functions including marking (as "caution" tape), painting, and packaging. I've used it to tape up packages and to mark spots so far, and it's holding up well. When you stretch it out, it doesn't tend to mess up and stick to itself-- and the once or twice it did, it was easy enough to get it unstuck and straightened out again.  It's peeled off cleanly on the spots I've tested, yet adhered well otherwise. It's a Big Bird yellow color (not obnoxiously bright, but certainly noticeable).	1
I was very happy to see that this tape gives me the performance that its price tag commands. Other tapes that I have used tend to stretch, peel or barely hold when initially placed. This stuff has stayed firm and it still adheres tightly to the initially pressure washed then dried concrete floor.  The color is bright, the tape is thick and the adhesion is superb. If long-term boundary marking, or safety striping is required, this 3M Vinyl Tape will meet those needs and more.	1
The 3M 471 marking tape is an excellent tape that has all kinds of uses from marking floors to enhance visibility to color coding items, or sealing packages. Its the type of tape you simply tuck away in your workshop until the need comes up. I'm planning on doing just that. If you want to hang on to your tools and don't want someone else to walk off with them, slim strips of this tape are perfect for that purpose. I used to do that sort of thing because many people opt to purchase the same kind of tools and unless you engrave your name or initials on them, you might just lose them.

Heavy duty, sticks very well - it's mostly like duct tape but it's more vinyl,less fibers, but it's about that thicknesss and stickiness, and it is colored specifically to designate high caution or dangerous areas.  Is strong enough with the polyvinyl feel that it should handle foot traffic well.  Each roll is 36 yards so it goes a way.  Anyone should be able to look at it and know what it's for, the yellow stands out with the black as a universal coloration for caution.  I've used it on metal and wood, and it's stuck great to both.	1
This is not duct tape. Rather it is more of a vinyl tape with a bit of stretch to it.  I initially was thinking of using on some outside steps but instead ended up putting in on some low hanging areas in the basement to mark head banging hazards.  It has a bit of a stretch to it so it is easy to place on surfaces with edges that need wrapped - however if you pull too hard it can also end up with wrinkles.  While I suppose it would likely work outside without a problem  I don't see it being as durable as I would want for such a project.	1
I have yet to use a 3M tape that I don't like, and this is no exception.  The tape is strong, with a good thickness that is easy to work with (it's thick enough that it doesn't curl in on itself or wrap around your fingers when you apply it).  I don't have enough time using it to know how well it will stand up, including adhesion, but I haven't seen any signs that it will fail early.  I think that the contrast ratio is very good.  The yellow is more subdued than their&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/3M-Vinyl-Tape-471-Yellow/dp/B00AQ2AB4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">3M Vinyl Tape 471 Yellow</a>&nbsp;tape to make it not such a stark difference between the yellow and black, which is great.  If the yellow was much brighter, it would be difficult for me to keep focused on this without straining.  The only downside that I can see is the price.  I still get sticker shock when I see a single roll of tape selling for over $40.  Depending on your uses, though, it might be totally worth it.  As a possible alternative, the yellow tape that I linked to is currently $24, and I've been using it as safety tape on a raised area on a nearby sidewalk.  It has held up to the weather and traffic for six months now, and I really like it.  Besides the obvious visual differences, the yellow tape is thinner - so it stretches more and conforms to shapes better, but this tape is easier to lay down in lines on a relatively flat surface because of the added thickness that helps it keep its shape.	1
Clings well, pulls off cleanly and easily. This tape us fairly thick vinyl that doesn't immediately flop around and get stuck to itself. It reminds me a bit of Contact Paper, without the PITA paper backing. Perfect for temporary or permanent caution tape. Using adhesive tape makes it much more attractive for longer-term applications. You will need scissors to cut it unless you don't care about wavy ragged edges that won't lay flat.  Great product for remodeling with guests around.	1
The product description seems to be very thorough so it is difficult to try and add anything useful to it. This product is intended to help keep people safe by easily marking out danger spots and safe zones primarily indoors, without using paint and also being easier to remove if you have to.	1
This safety tape works as advertised.  It's slightly rubberized with a one-sided stickiness to it.  It has a strong hold to whatever surface it is on.  It's not reflective and the yellow could have been more neon yellow, but this is strong tape that will caution others of whatever obstacle this tape surrounds.  I do find the price rather high for tape with a one-time use life.	1
This is great sticky safety tape that works in various situations.  I taped this around part of the support beams in my garage to make it more visible when parking the car in the garage.  It sticks on nicely and I have not had any problems so far.  It applies easy and removes easily without any messy residue.  You can pretty much use this in any situation that calls for it.  It's a great product and if you have a purpose for it, I highly recommend this.	1
We use this in our light manufacturing facility to call attention to hazardous areas and to promote employee safety. It seems to work well as we have reduced bumps and bruises into various shelving and equipment. it's certainly not an inexpensive tape, but if you plan on using this for a permanent application it is of high quality. Our facility is well lit, so we don't need reflective tape.  If you are using this outside, it improves visibility but a reflective option maybe better.	1
3M makes great products.  Great durability and great adhesives.  This item is no different.  The black/yellow 'DANGER' pattern is a great way to tape down cords, sharp edges, obstacles, but also a great way to make your house/garage look like a Mythbusters set!	1
We recently had some landscaping work done on our front yard where there is no fence between the sidewalk and the desert gravel which covers the entire yard.  It took several days.  This 3M Safety Stripe Tape was perfect for use as a delineating line on stakes between the sidewalk and yard, but at night, unless a car was turning around in the street and the beams hit the tape, you would not know it was there.  No reflection even off the street lamp.  It's a heavy duty tape that adheres well, but if it is to be used in a hazardous area/manner at night, I would suggest the area be well lit.	1
I have used a different brand of safety stripe tape at the office, and it was very good. However, I think the 3M tape is better because it seems heavier duty. It's made of a slightly stretchy material that feels like rubber. It was very easy to apply to an uneven surface, and it stuck much better than I expected. It's a very tough and durable material that should survive the abuse it will receive with foot and tire traffic. The yellow is bright and the stripes are very visible, leaving nothing to chance. It's almost everything you could ask for in a safety stripe tape. If I could change anything, it would be to add a reflective coating to make it more visible at night.	1
Last year, the guy who delivered our hay bent the the tin terribly by pulling too far forward.  I also wanted to mark the driving space through the middle of the barn and steps so they can be seen at night.  Since I was using this in my barn, I didn't exactly apply it over a perfectly clean surface. I brushed what I could away and then applied the tape. It came off the roll so quickly and easily that I was suspicious about it's sticking ability. But it was easy to lay down in nice straight lines and it sticks great. It has done fine in the cold. It is fine being driven on and walked on. I am trilled to have it at the edge of the feeder where I always stumble. It shows up nicely.  This is an easy to use, perfect safety tape.	1
This tape has Good adhesion quality on even wet and dirty surfaces . Excellent temperature range, even on cold metal. Clear and visible. Marks areas for safety concern. NO reflectivity or visibility in low light. What is easy to see in daylight can get missed at night. Am excellent choice for well lit areas.	1
Price aside, this is good safety tape.  It has strong stick and is highly visible.  Very useful for the job site and areas where you want to quickly draw eyes to an area of caution.	1
This is definitely premium quality tape for marking areas that you need to call attention too.  Will work great for unfinished basement with low hanging pipes and beams.  A great warning for uneven steps.  It is primarily used on commercial establishments like factories, warehouses, mechanical rooms.  It is very visible even on dark spaces.  The tape adheres on most surfaces even rough, and conforms easily on uneven shapes and corners.	1
The back of this tape is very sticky, and the tape itself is strong. When removed, it leaves no residue. Note that, while the yellow/black contrasting colors are eye-catching, this tape is not reflective.	1
This is very expensive tape. It is also very good tape. It it NOT reflective. Some applications require reflective tape, and this wouldn't work.

OK sealing tape, but the adhesive is too easy to peel off without showing tampering. You need to press and squeegee this tape on hard, then give it a day to bond before counting on it to reveal tampering. Even then, tampering may be possible.	1
This is a great tool to protect your moving boxes when moving as the void sign will show if the boxes have been tampered with. The tape it self is very strong and durable. Happy with purchase!	1
Not sticky enough for my liking, but if used over clear packing tape, it seems to work best.	1
This tape gives added security that a package has not been opened when shipped.  The idea is that if the tape is removed it is impossible to realign the diagonal lines on the tape so a person would notice the package had been opened.  I used a scissor to cut the tape. The tape holds well once I put in on large mailing envelopes. I used it on a box as well and it held fine. I did notice how the diagonal lines don't realign if the tape is removed.  If you want the added security of knowing that a package you send is not opened than this is a good tape to use.	1
I didn't have anything particularly special or delicate to send -- I just used the tape to seal a gift I mailed to a friend. It worked fine, stuck firmly, just as tape should.	1
This tape isn't thick or strong, but that isn't it's purpose.  I found it to be overall decent and although after 5 minutes the message didn't come off on the package, after a day it did.	1
This tape looks red on the roll, but it's transparent with just a red message that says Check Seal Before Accepting and it has some red half lines above that and below it.  It reminds me of standard, lightweight shipping tape.  To me it is very close to that in stickiness and durability.  It's thin enough that it is easy to mold around sides and over seams.  In tests I've done with it, it was sticky enough to pull some paper off the box when I pulled the tape off, and it lost some stickiness after I'd pulled it off and put it back on.  Other than that, I can't really see any big difference in this tape and regular Scotch shipping tape, except for the red warning.  Like their regular shipping tape, I find that I can poke it with a pen to tear it, or use scissors or a shipping tape holder/applicator.  I did notice that when this tape is sealed down on top of this tape on a package, it is very hard to separate the two strips.  I tried it out on a small box, a brown cardboard box, plastic fashion mailers, and yellow shipping envelopes.  It worked like very good shipping tape on all of those.  It does make a good seal and it is easy to work with.  It seems more like this tape is for the warning and for regular old box shipping than any real security on the label though.  Once I use a piece, it is easy to find the edge to get some more off the roll later.	1
This is decent security tape for sealing a container to ensure that it hasn't been opened and tampered with. This isn't shipping tape. This is more suitable for packages that are inside larger shipping cartons.  The words on the seal clearly show at a glance whether the box has been opened or not.  Make sure and use a standard tape gun to ensure that this tape makes a good flat seal and doesn't have ugly wrinkles, because a wrinkled seal kind of defeats the purpose of a seal like this.	1
This tape does hold well for light weight needs, but it's pretty thin. So thin that if you're shipping a medium or large box, the tape isn't really strong enough to hold tight. I find it works really well when applied over thicker, stronger clear tape. It adheres to the clear tape really well. However someone skilled could then just lift the clear tape off a package and in the process lift this tape off as well, keeping the seal unbroken. This tape is best for light duty needs like small packages and large envelops.	1
It's important to note that this printed message tape is not meant to replace regular packing tape.  Rather, it is to be used in conjunction with your normal packing tape, and then placed over it.  The primary purpose of this is to help prevent tampering with packages.	1
This 2 7/8 in. security tape is clear and is printed diagonally with bars and a "Check Seal Before Accepting" warning with a 1 in. repeat.  It is moderately sticky but clear shows any tampering.  It is not meant as packing tape, but could be used as such for smaller boxes and mailers.	1
I experimented with this tape and believe it will serve an anti-tamporing purpose. It can be used to create tells if a parcel was opened. The trick is to use it economically and yet still sufficiently to create that effect.	1
This Scotch Printed Message "CHECK SEAL BEFORE ACCEPTING" Box Sealing Tape is perfect for any business shipping delicate or regulated products. We ship Federally regulated items that are usually obviously are what they are and are also high value value to potential thieves that could target them in transit (happens quite often). This tape is useful as both a deterrent since it will be obvious if tampered with and as an indicator of potential problems for the receiver.  The tape is not meant to be used as shipping tape, but rather in conjunction with standard packing tape. This is placed over the seams so it would have to be cut or removed to get at items in the package.  The tape is good quality and fairly easy to tell if it has been tampered with in transit.  Highly Recommended!  CFH	1
I think the best way to approach reviewing this Scotch Printed Message tape is to look at what it's supposed to do, and then comment.  --Printed with message CHECK SEAL BEFORE ACCEPTING  It does say that. However it doesn't say that in large letters. It's entirely possible for the receiver to not see the letters. They are faint and small.  --High adhesion and holding power resists popping for a secure seal throughout the supply chain  I'm surprised at the fact that this tape isn't stickier. I tried it on a box and I could easily lift it off and reposition.  I put some tape on regular paper and could pull it off without a minimum amount of damage the paper.  --Diagonal lines on tape are impossible to realign if package is opened  It was so easy to pull off this tape and reposition it that I have to doubt this claim.  SUMMARY I typically buy Scotch tapes. From my experience Scotch brand tapes are THE best and worth the price. For my purposes though, which is shipping small items, this tape wouldn't work. It's not terribly sticky and worse, the CHECK SEAL print is too faint and ignorable.	-1
Only 4 stars due to the significant price of this product.  But beyond the price, the tape is very resilient, holding up under water when used on a flat surface.  We've put it on commercial tile, polished concrete, and other similar surfaces for floor marking and it does the job well.  The color is very eye catching and it doesn't raise up under foot traffic.  As others have mentioned, this can also be used for packing or sealing -- although that's a very expensive tape to use for this function.  I would likely use another colored packing tape for that type of work.  This products strength is its hold and marking for visbility.	1
I expected this to be thicker, like electrical tape, but it's not-- it's just wider and slightly thicker than the regular ole' Scotch tape we all know and love.  I was most interested in this for packaging-- it's a fun and festive way to jazz up a cardboard box for mailing. But because of its bright color, it's also good for marking things that you want to stand out. I noticed that one reviewer put it to the test as far as moisture goes, so I went one step further and taped it to a glass and then washed it by hand. The tape stayed put. I suspect this would do fine out in the rain for limited periods of time.	1
This tape is strong, very strong.  How do I know?  I inserted it in one of my packing tape dispensers and found it exceedingly difficult to tear off.  Id be happy to tape up any box with it and not fear that the tape would come away from the join.  Im using it in two ways.  First, Ive put a strip on a front step that is not always visible to visitors.  Now they cant miss it unless they never look down.  Second, Im using to label boxes (Im getting ready to move).  The red color is a standout, and I mark the room it goes to right on the tape.  No more guessing where the movers should take each box.  There are additional colors of this tape, but they are also about 1/4 of the width of this tape.  This is the only 48 mm. tape I saw, so if you need a wide tape, this is the one.  Overall, this is a useful tape whether for marking things around the house or for taping or labeling moving boxes.  I am delighted to it so useful and happy to recommend it.  FIVE STARS!	1
I have used this tape to seal boxes as well as to mark spots on my house that needed repairs. The tape holds well and is easy to cut. It is also very bright.  I use this for two reasons. I used it to seal boxes that were more important than others.  This tape is bright. When I need those boxes I won't have to read the description I will just look for the bright red tape.  I also used the tape to mark spots on my house, both inside and out. This spring I have a lot of little repairs to make on my house. I have to do everything from adding cement to areas that have gotten worn over the years, nailing lose siding, calking around some windows and scraping and repainting small areas in my house as well as around my outside windows.  This tape was great for marking the areas after I inspected my house so I would come back and fix them.  The tape holds well but is easy to remove. I did not damage anything when removing the tape. The tape is also easy to cut with a small scissor.	1
The Scotch Color Coding tape in red stands out brightly in any environment, so it is great to use to mark things (luggage, boxes, etc).  It also is exceptional tape, to be used in putting together boxes and bundles.	1
I am always amazed at the tapes that one can get these days. First at the price, but then at what they can actually do.  We have a drain cover down in our woods and when we attempt to mow down weeds near it, our mower sometimes meets it as an unmovable object. I taped the raised edges and the smooth part of the top cover and presto it is now visible even under a partial cover of pine needles. Simply amazing that it has stayed there in monsoon type rains and changes of temperature.	1
The tape is very bright red, and it is white on the other side. The white makes it maintain bright red color even over darker surfaces. Great for marking boxes and similar applications.	1
This thin tape is lightweight but sturdy, sitting nearly flush with the surface it's applied to. The adhesive is quite good, I was able to reposition the tape several times without it losing stickiness. It sticks to "dirty" surfaces without a problem, even if you skip the usually-required first step of prime the surface by washing it and letting it dry.  It's a "thin" tape (unlike duct tape), about the thickness of packaging tape (the non-clear kind). Its durability, thin profile, and stickiness, combined with the bright color, make this tape a good choice for marking paths on the floor or other long-term markings like "dangerous step".  This stuff isn't cheap at the current pricing, but isn't meant to be a general-purpose tape. Recommended for high-visibility marking.	1
happy	1
perfect , nice meter	1
This meter works as expected, cant beat the price. The leads do not seem as flexible as my other Fluke multimeter though, I thing the plastic insulation may not be as nice.	1
My first Fluke and my first clamp meter in one.  I waited too long to meet you!  On one hand it's nearly perfect, but there's at least one thing to be noted.  When you rotate the selector from Off to VAC for example, you'll eventually get in a situation where you didn't rotate it enough while you thought you did, because you felt the knob give and saw the display light up.  When it's not rotated enough you'll see a lightning bolt and four dashes.  When it's correctly rotated to VAC, you'll see 0.0 V AC on the display.  Because I didn't know what to look for when I first got it, I touched it to a live electrical circuit while not being properly rotated to VAC, and I only saw "- - - -".  So my first thought was the circuit was not active, which is bad.  My experience is user error, but in my opinion, the device should not display anything until the knob is rotated into the correct position.  Also the clamp needs to be completely closed to get an decent reading of Amps, but that's just my bad.  As I'm only doing power line work, I don't need tremendous input impedance, mV, or capacitance at this point.  So 5 stars and thank you Amazon!	1
Good product does what it was made to do.	1
Works perfect, but now I wish I had bought the 325 model. The 325 model will also check DC amps..	1
Exellent meter, it is a FLUKE what more can you say, it does its job.	1
Got the box the Fluke came in, there was a different meter inside so I sent it back.	1
Great meter, just what I would expect from Fluke!	1
Good meter but I exchanged it for the 325 as I wanted to read DC current.	1
GoooooD	1
I use a lot of Fluke meters at work and this one seems a little cheap. It is however compact.  When I do an ohms checkout, its .2-.5 ohms off. Not a big deal I know but come on. I get zero ohms on my cheapie meter.  During continuity checks, the beep is so faint I can hardly hear it.  The AMP function does seem to work fine.  My voltage measurements compared to two other meters I own are off by 3 volts (unknown if Fluke is at fault). I do and always have been a fan of Fluke meters but this one has let me down.  The price, name, and features were the reason for buying. No where does it mention where it is  made.  I suspect it is outsourced.	-1
Accurate tough and dependable battery life is great I own several fluke meters and they have never let me down	1
Fine instrument.	1
Very well made. I had it for several years and no trouble.  Very easy to use.  Perfect if you can have only one multimeter. It does everything.	1
Very accurate on amps reading.	1
great meter	1
I've always had a multi meter in the home. It's one of those tools you don't realize you can't live without until you had one. I guess I've been though 3 or 4 of the Radio Shack models and still have the last one I bought. But this one takes the prize of being the best one yet. Don't get me wrong I'm not throwing away my other unit, but the clamp on function of this model makes it a lot easier to use.	1
Bought this as a simple and small meter for work.  I have larger fluke clamps but wanted a small one for basic stuff that I can keep in my tool bag.  Its a good meter.	1
Fluke makes the best meters period. When the safety of your employees is on the line you can trust it bargain tools.	1
We purchased this changing table for our church's restroom. Installation is pretty straightforward with clear instructions and a bar to assist with ensuring the product is level. One note on installation - the hardware is not included. The directions give various examples of installation situations and the hardware to purchase, which include lag bolts and toggle bolts. Note that these do add a little to the cost of this product.  Once installed, this changer is very sturdy. All in all, my installation utilizes 6 toggle bolts (each rated for 50 lbs) and 3 lag bolts into studs. In fact, if I put some weight on the changer my wall moves without the changer pulling out or bending. The safety strap securely holds the child in the changer while the two compartments allow for protective sheets, diapers or wipes to be stored.  I would highly recommend this changer.	1
When I ordered this, I had no idea that it didn't come with the mounting brackets and other hardware that is needed to mount it to the wall. I'm on a very limited fixed income, so I am not able to purchase the mounting hardware at this time. However, I don't need to have it mounted on the wall to be able to review the quality of the changing station. Mounting it on the wall isn't going to change anything about it. So, this is a nice quality changing station. It's actually nicer than I expected. It's a made of a heavy bacteria resistant high-density polyethylene (HDPE) that should last for years. I really like the disposable liner dispenser that is built into it. It also has two hooks on each end for hanging your purse and/or diaper bag. There is also a safety strap for the baby.  The reason it doesn't come with mounting hardware is because there are several different options on how to hang it and you have to have a qualified professional come in and tell you which hardware you need for your particular situation, and then you need to have it professionally installed. It's a nice changing station and when it's folded up it hardly takes up any room at all. I actually have a plan for this that doesn't include babies, but according to the directions you can put a baby that weighs up to 50 lbs on this changing station. Nice quality, and it looks nice too.	1
Note that in all of these reviews, the writers state that this requires professional installation. Know that this is completely true. This product has countless warnings that insist this MUST be installed by a professional. So, ditch the idea of doing-it-yourself or asking "the custodian who can fix everything." Seriously, call in the pros here ... when it comes to the safety of infants, take no risks.  This is a slightly cheaper version of the Koala Kare stations that you might have seen everywhere. And, while I like the Koala Kare stations a bit more, this is great for the business that cannot or does not want to invest that much money.  Like the Koala Kare stations, this ECR4KIDS folds nicely and conserves space. Moreover, it opens slowly and carefully (which prevents injury).  This is a great alternative to Koala Kare! Recommended!	1
I absolutely love this!  I have a child in diapers and babysit children in diapers.  I had a professional install this, as suggested, and it took less than thirty minutes.  This has been used over 100 times and wiped down with Clorox wipes between each change, and shows no signs of wear!  What a great thing for any home with children!!!	1
I own some retail furniture and mattress stores which attract all sorts of people; single people; older couples; and married couples with small children.  When you have small kids around they sometimes need their pants attended to.  In the past my customers had to use the sink basin in our restroom in order the change their children's diapers.  This is both unsanitary and possibly dangerous.  When I got the chance to try this item out I was excited.  First let me reinforce the message that the manufacturer includes on their product page, their website, in the instructions and on the box itself: have a professional install this changing table.  It's too important of an item to leave the installation to an amateur.  I called someone who had done work for us before and he had it mounted on the wall in about 40 minutes.  It feels solid and supportive.  It like the build of this product as it should give parents enough confidence to lay their children on it.  Since I have only had it in service for a few days I haven't receive a lot of feedback from customers but those that have used it love it and are very grateful that he had this available to them.  I really like this changing station.	1
These are good, but not as sensitive as I`d hoped. I was surprised how small they are. I had to put 3 in parallel to get the resistance drop I needed.	1
For the price of one of these I got a whole bag and didn't have to drive - just click click and a couple days later open the door and there it is.	1
These work great and are very inexpensive, so it's easy to pick them a few and experiment with them. I used them in a project with a laser to time water droplets.	1
im satisfied	1
I used these to replace the photoresistors in a decorative, single LED, deck rail lights (one rechargeable AAA battery) that quit working and I wasn't sure that was the problem because with a newly charged battery the light came on but wouldn't turn off.  Turned out I guessed correctly and these photoresisters did the trick so for $6.34 I saved the replacement cost of around $35 each.  Plus I have many extras in case any of the other lights quit working.  So I would recommend this product for this use.	1
Works as expected for intended purpose.	1
THESE PHOTOCELLS ARE A BIT BETTER THAN EXPECTED.THEY ARE PHYSICALLY SMALLER THAN WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS ORDERING, BUT A BIT BETTER IN THE RESPONSE DEPARTMENT.	1
Just what I needed for a electronics repair.  Checked all the resistant values and they are not all consistant.  I was able to get two matched for my project.	1
Worked fine for me.	1
They're resistors. They change resistance in light. Why are you reading reviews?	1
They are light sensitive resistors.  And they work. Delivered a day early as a matter of fact. Thanks	1
perfect	1
These are excellent CdS Photo Resistors that provide a broad and rapid change in resistance depending on the strength of the light source.  Resistance of these run 50-60 Ohms in very strong light to around 500K Ohms in complete darkness.  I've used these for sensor demonstrations and they have worked extremely well.	1
Very useful for light-controlled circuits. All of the pieces are very close in value and none of them were dead on arrival.  Unfortunately, they arrived with the (rather fiddly) leads all bent every which way. It would have been nice to receive these on paper tape or at least packed in a way that they didn't need to be bent manually for storage.	1
They do the job.  Measure the resistance on them before using.  Should be fine.	1
Great	1
Item as described. A+	1
Worked as expected.	1
Wonderful Transaction, As Expected.	1
Let the rating speak.	1
Everything was good.	1
Works as described.	1
Excellent Service and High quality products	1
I have not played too much with these devices, I set one up, and  they are very fast response to  light level changes.  they are very small. I did not pay an arm and a leg for them :) will update post later, so far 5*	1
Sipped fast and tested that all read within a .01 margin of error, I doubt many industrial items can claim such accuracy.	1
Nice, consistent photo resistors.	1
handy	1
Great for holding burets for doing titrations.  The heavy base makes it quite stable.	1
Your standard high school chemistry lab stand. Sturdy, clamp works well.	1
Absolutely what I wanted and expected.  Very professional service with timely delivery.  Would Highly recommend!	1
This stand is perfect for a burette (tube 3/4" diameter).  It is stable and sturdy enough.	1
They decided to put rubber on the test tube holder, which catches fire whenever i attempt to heat up anything, but other than that, its great	1
No problem with the clamps.  The base is heavy enough I don't have to worry about tipping.  I us this for doing some photography shots so I can't give a description about its use in a lab environment.	1
No complaints here.	1
it's paper, it works with the scale	1
Perfectly good at what they're for, easily removed from the box and stored in there as well. I would not recommend removing the stack entirely from the box, because they're packed tightly and glossy they will expand and probably shift around, making it difficult to put them back in. Just maneuver one out at a time and you'll avoid the problems some people have sadly had.	1
Wonderful for weighing materials, but the papers themselves can be volatile. Will send your materials flying if you aren't careful.	1
Exact!	1
Classic weighing paper, just what we wanted	1
Exactly as advertised.	1
Used a few so far. Works for intended task.	1
nice product- when you order from Wall Control you know you will have a well fitting-strong -solid piece of workmanship.	1
Works great with our Wall Control unit.  Very sturdy.	1
Nice shelf	1
It is a metal shelf.  What else is there to say?	1
I love the Wall Control system. I have put up at least 4 separate systems at work and home. This shelf is sturdy and dependable. I haven't tested it for strength, but it seems reasonable on that front as well.	1
Let's face it, there are some out there who have not 'sunk their teeth' into the new dental technology. And they should and this is the perfect product to start with. The device is of high quality while the brush (Oral-B) is the top recommended tooth brush among the dental care professionals. Taken together, this is one powerful combination. It makes the perfect gift as well. Highly recommended.	1
Its critical you use an electric toothbrush properly. It you are brushing your teeth with an electric toothbrush like a regular toothbrush, its wrong. Slow gentle movements and allow the head to do the work.	1
DO NOT BUY....IT VIBRATES HARD AND KNOCKS AGAINST YOUR TEETH......NOT SURE BUT IT MIGHT DAMAGE ENAMEL ON TEETH.	-1
My wife likes it. Even takes it on trips with her. Has a built it timer feature that is nice. Fits the round head brushes too.	1
Tried the save-snipped-leads-from-resistors method to wire some traces on this board. Also managed to (with perseverance) to solder traces for componets. To make traces with solder bubbles, do yourself a favor and get a pointy/conical soldering tip.	1
Because I build a lot of relatively simple projects (parts count, anyway), I needed some small boards for prototyping. Up until now, I had to buy relatively expensive larger boards and cut them down. These boards are great because they are small, cheap, and single-sided. You might think that the last item is a deficiency, but double-sided, plated-through holes take a LOT more solder. You also have to be careful with component mounting because the top side is live. If you have complex wiring you probably do need to have wires on both sides, but these are better for simple projects.  The boards are not tinned, but a little buffing to take off any oxidation before you start and a hot iron allows perfect solder joints. I bought 20 of them and they all look usable.	1
Avoid these boards.  The traces come off with the slightest heat and solder will not adhere most of the time.  When it does, any pressure on the joint will cause the ring to lift right off the board.	-1
hood	1
Part arrived quickly and is what was expected.	1
Exactly what I needed... used 4 already!	1
good	1
Excellent,	1
used several of these now, the pads are glued on well, ive never had one lift on me.	1
Boards are pretty thin and not super strong, but they work. If you need them this century though, order elsewhere. They ship direct from china and take a bit to get here, about a month for me.	1
no complaints	1
They seem a bit cheap, but work just fine.	1
Decent product, they are a little cheaply made but for the price they are great, from Sunkee	1
Since Radio Shack is not around here, I needed a source for the proto boards.  These were slightly warped [not perfectly flat] but work great.	1
Meet expectations	1
A little hard to get use to.	1
They have worked just fine for several of my projects so far. I highly recommend.	1
These are exactly as advertised.  Would buy again.	1
works good	1
Decent protoboards for the money. Don't overheat.	1
Works great!	1
used several they work	1
Warning don't use high temp on these, traces start to come off easy... Still gets the job done, but keep that in mind!	1
Great for prototyping circuits before printing PCBs, or making one off projects where printing a PCB is not worth it	1
Strong cleaning and the timing function ensures that you get your 2 minutes in each time you use.  Will improve your oral health.	1
Needed another for my wife.  good price.	-1
Not bad for the price. I have been spoiled by the more expensive brands and actually stopped using them for a while and went back to the normal toothbrush. Picked this up to see if I wanted to get back into the habit of using an electric and now wish that I would have just purchased the more advanced, expensive model.  That said, this is no 'ding' on the product itself it does work great and does a great job brushing although it may be a little too aggressive for some users that would prefer a sensitive option.	1
Spoil the pearly whites. Cost effective and attractive. Works great	1
I bought this with the deep sweep head and it works easily, rinses safely and charges easily. It's been recharging reliably each time for months now and the heads are easy to  change. It's the only brush that makes the job so easy, It's not a chore. Very thorough!	1
Took forever to charge the first time (like 36 hours?), but then it ran for almost 2 weeks before needing a recharge. Seems to work well on my teeth. Time will tell.	1
This is the brush I needed.  Much better in RPMs than my old brusher..Use this with the professional deep sweep.	1
Other oral-b power toothbrushes I've had have worked great but I was never a fan of the small circular head. I always felt like I could have gotten more teeth cleaned in less time. This brush is great and it lets you  know when it's time for a replacement brush as the bristles fade. I had to replace my sonicare that I left at a friend's house and was very surprised that this made me feel that I didn't miss my old brush at all	1
I have been using the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Philips-Sonicare-HX9332-05-DiamondClean-Rechargeable-Electric-Toothbrush/dp/B0052JN7XG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush</a>&nbsp;which I bought when it first came out, but decided to give this Oral-B a try and compare. They are both in very different price ranges - the Sonicare is about 190 bucks, while the Oral-B is about 50. So, there is a huge difference there. I do love the Sonicare, but the Oral-B is great as well, and a lot more budget friendly.  The Oral-B is the most like a regular manual toothbrush, as far as the feel of it in the mouth and the cleaning action feel. The vibration is stronger on the Oral-B and feels like it is cleaning a bit more, because of the stronger vibrations.  The actual head on the Oral-B is also more sized like a manual toothbrush. I actually like this fuller head better than the Sonicare.  The pressure sensor on the Oral-B seems to be more sensitive than on my Sonicare. That is neither good or bad, but just a difference. The Sonicare also has more settings to use for cleaning, but this Oral-B is just fine with the one basic setting. I only use one setting on the Sonicare anyway.  The neck on this one, leading to the brush head, is a bit slimmer and therefore a bit more comfortable in the mouth and to use.  It feels like it cleans really well. It really feels like it is scrubbing and cleaning as opposed to the Sonicare which in comparison just feels like it is vibrating. I have braces, so it can be difficult for me to brush well with all the obstacles of the braces. I feel like I get a better, more thorough clean on all surfaces with the Oral-B, more quickly and more easily since the brush head is a bit bigger and covers more area at a time.  It gets the gumline really well too and easily. It gets between my teeth and brackets of my braces well.  I think this Oral-B is a great choice. It does a great job, is affordable, and feels like it is cleaning better ( a bit more aggressively?) than the much higher priced Sonicare Diamond Clean.	1
We have been using Sonicare for the last 5 years and the brush died. I didn't want to spend a lot of money and 2 of this Oral B are less than 1 Sonicare. I love how clean my teeth feel. I like this brush much better than the Sonicare.	1
This thing is GREAT.  To start off, this is the first rechargeable toothbrush I have had with a reasonably sized base; not occupying a big footprint on my counter.  The toothbrush itself is quiet, yet performs excellent.  The various sweeping actions of the different bristles really seems to work well; and the bristels on the tip move in the right way to actually clean behind my wisdom teeth, which is a failure of most toothbrushes.  The brush head is replaceable, with a 'fading bristles' method of determining when the head needs to be replaced.  This toothbrush works well, is less expensive than comparable models, and has a properly sized base unit.  Its a toothbrush, I don't need a lot, but what I do need this one has.	1

My teeth felt clean and gums invigorated, without being so rough that I had sore spots. Often with a new brush I'll have a spot or two that gets irritated at first, not with this. Great investment with great payoff.	1
Decided to try this new model even tho my old brush was still going strong.  After using for a couple months, I prefer my 3000 or 5000 series (at 2 and 3 times the cost)  Totally different brush stroke than 3000/5000 series.  Optional 8 different brushes to purchase! Pressure control Indicator bristles fade, to indicate when to replace brush Hard brushing alert Professional timer 1 cleaning mode (Daily Clean) my first had a second speed that I never used Charge level display The handle remains waterproof (of course) and easy to hold - excellent balance  1 handle 1 charger - compact, full strength for over a week when I was traveling and didn't take the charger 1 refill brush head - too large for my small mouth already overcrowded with teeth  60-day money back guarantee and a 2-Year replacement or repair warranty  I can't imagine ever buying another brand than Oral B - I have been hooked since my first 11 years ago.	1
I've been using Oral-B (Braun) electric toothbrushes for years.  They've done an excellent job preventing plaque build-up and keeping my gums healthy.  I like this model better than the version that's smaller, lighter and simply vibrates...that version is easier to use on back molars, but doesn't seem to clean as well overall.  Looking specifically at this model...  Pros: Excellent cleaning action Small charging stand Comparable with different styles of brush heads  Cons: No place to put another person's brush head Only single speed Included head will flick toothpaste absolutely everywhere if you take it out of your mouth while operating (trust me on this...) The base is slightly dished, which holds water after rinsing the brush.  After a week, there's a buildup of crud that needs to be wiped off.  All in all, I like this toothbrush.  The cons aren't deal killers.  It's not perfect, but it does it's job.	1
Shaped uncoated sheet metal with rubber handles and shape ends. Very sharp and do as advertised. Be careful with your angle, it's easy to gouge your printer bed's surface	1
nice	1
Order some bandaids too... Yeeeouch these are sharp.  When cleaning up 3D-Prints, these Rock.  When you slip, these CUT.  Getting 2nd pair for children.  Just kidding.  But am getting 2nd for Wife as she now has 2 3D Printers and using mine a LOT! (Though she's only jabbed herself once)	1
Great for support removal and smoothing trims on my prints.	1
Not bad for the price!	1
A "Must Have" for removing goobers, boogers, and strings. Highly recommend!	1
Good entry level tools	1
Too expensive the quality isn't there. The razor edges dull out and chip too fast	-1
looks good!	1
I'm so happy I bought this kit. I use the angled and flathead tools on an almost daily basis. Many times I need something that sharp just to start popping something off of the printbed, because my metal spatula will be too thick and these are the perfect tool.	1
Works for my 3D printer needs	1
Terrible	-1
Used it on knife type weapons vs. gun. Nice, solid grip & feel Just NOT a lot of it for the money	1
Great product.  Tried the sandpaper grip tape and it sucked...too abrasive.  This product is the perfect rubberized texture for my pistol.	1
Grippy without being scratchy. Strongly Sticky without leaving residue if you need to pull it off.  I used 1 sheet on a revolver and my cellphone case and both are extremely more comfortable and non-slippery like before, while still looking just as good. Great idea for using this on the phone.	1
used it in ruger, hipoint for better grip, aluminum wallet & it does not slip in my pockets and my sony phone & my mom's samsung phones & she has not drop it when it has this tape. will buy again if i will need it.	1
Used these for my quadcopter remote and it is awesome so, I also used some for my led flashlight, and probably will use some on my HT ham radio.	1
Really grippy stuff, doesn't scratch flesh like regular grip tape does. I used this for side steps on my truck and it still has grip even when wet.	1
provides the additional griping capacity my wife needed  and looks good on the gun	1
Works exactly as advertised. Good stuff.	1
bought this for a better grip on a dual 26650 battery box mod, Tesla Invader, nice easy install and looks better than I had anticipated, Good and Grippy now!	1
Utilize this stuff for my guns and cell phone cases. Great stuff, definitely unlimited types of use with this grip tape. Great product.	1
Works as advertised.  A bit overkill.	1
Wish it was grippyer.	1
Nice....	1
Really good stuff.	1
works well to keep sweaty hands or hands that are wet from losing their grip.	1
It sticks good and has just the right feel.........not sticky really, but easy to handle.	1
Product seems to work good. Exactly what I needed. Good company to work with. Edit:7/8/15 Product works great. I installed on S&W  SD9VE and was having trouble here in the south with sweaty hands while shooting and this stuff helps tremendously. Edit 2: 7/13/15 I bought a Luvvit iphone 5 case, feels like a naked phone, and we like that. The case was perfect but I can't stop messing with perfect stuff so I wrapped the outside edges with the GT 5000 grip tape. What a difference! It no longer accidentally slips out of my pocket while not enlarging the phone. Good stuff. I'm sure I will find more uses.	1
Exactly as advertised. The strips are plenty big to outfit several firearms or what ever you need. My Gen2 Glock 22 now looks as good as it feel and as good as it shoots. I used the scraps to adhere to a phone so it won't slip around when changing hands. Works on just about anything you need extra traction. I'm looking around the house for more projects.  PROS: AWESOME and American made. Shipped the day I ordered it and arrived three days later. They were courteous enough to email me to let me know that it would arrive in an unassuming white envelope and not to mistake it for junk mail. Nice touch but if it's a problem, change the envelope. CONS: None !!!  Overall I'm super happy. I will order more when needed.  UPDATED: I ordered more. I've actually ran out of things to use it on. I need to buy more toys.	1
I've ordered this more than once .	1
This stuff is great it work on ever-thing. Heating the tape up with a heat gun helps to stick it better  on different things	1
Holding on well after about 1 month.  Used blue painters tape to make a mask around the handle of where the grip needed to be.  Sliced the blue tape off and opened up the pattern to trace onto the back of the grip tape.  Cut out and install to the handle.  Nice grip by looks, feel, and durability so far.	1
They showed up on time, were well-packaged, and worked great.  On the flip side, they were expensive for what they are.  Right now, electronic parts are still affordable and available. This may not be the case when all electronics manufacturing occurs outside of the United States.	1
Great	1
These non latching Hall Switches are great to replace the reed switches.  Very pleased with their performance.	1
These things are pretty cool.  I was going to use magnetic reed switches for an upcoming costume project.  I need to have these switches installed in my fingers and my thumb will have a magnet.  When I contact my thumb and finger, I want the switch to activate.  I was originally going to use reed switches, but was worried as they are pretty fragile and I was worried about vibration triggering them when I was just moving around.  I was really glad when I found these and now that I tested them, they work great.  I got some small high powered magnets for holding papers to a metal board and I can get the switches to activate at about 0.5 inches from the sensor in open air.  I put a small piece of plastic in front to simulate the effect of the glove shell and the performance wasn't really impacted.  They are very responsive, and very small, and a lot more durable than a glass reed switch.	1
I used these to make a tachometer along with a BASIC Stamp. Worked very well. Simple to use and accurate enough for my needs (I'm only measuring between 0-3000 RPM). Also they delivered quickly and all items were in good order.  They get two thumbs up from this guy.	1
Not sure I understand or feel the same about the complaints here. I have had one rubber bristle fall off but it is only if you leave excessive amounts of glue when you go to put it away to dry out. These rockler silicone brushes are excellent. I have about a half dozen in our shop and I have never purchased disposable brushes again. Not only are they completely reusable forever, but they just work better. The disposable brushes always release hairs in the glue and you have to remove them. This brush cleans up easily and peels off quickly every single time. Every woodworker should own a set of silicone glue brushes.	1
hot	1
Glue peels off easily	1
These brushes are a woodworker's dream.  No longer do you have to worry about cleaning brushes or using your finger to spread glue.  Just let the glue dry on them and after the glue hardens, it just comes right off because it can't stick to the silicone.	1
I use my fingers to even out glue all the time working with wood but I have a tendency to get it on my jeans and it don't come out so I thought I'd give these a try. They work great for smaller pieces and the comes right off when dry	1
Works well, cleans up well. Silicone glue will not set on the product.  I recommend this to anyone doing any wood glue work.	1
These do NOT fit standard receptacles and outlets at stated.  You need 6-32.  These Work: http://www.amazon.com/Gardner-Bender-SK-632T-Screw-Phillips/dp/B00ATODOQ4/ref=sr_1_2?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1454776638&sr=1-2&keywords=6-32+screws	-1
they work as bolts	1
Good to have on hand	1
The Pyrex brand made its name for heat-resistant, tough glassware based on borosilicate glass.  They use a different, less-expensive formula now and breakage rates due to thermal stress fractures are up.  I wanted 'something better/safer' and this is it.  The crystal clear glass and easily read measurements are also a plus. The rolled rim is wide enough to serve as a hand grip for pouring.  I use this for mixing liquids in the kitchen--eggs for omelets and batters. The high straight sides also work well with an immersion blender but the diameter is too small to use a standard egg beater for whipping heavy cream or egg whites.  Don't use a heavy spoon with this--hitting the side of the beaker abruptly can cause breakage.  Buy a laboratory stirrer instead or use plastic stirrers.  I bought two of these and one is still going strong; my wife broke the other by vigorously whacking a spoon against the sides while making pancake batter.  Outside dimensions are 5 1/4 inches tall and 4 inches across(including the nicely rolled rim.)  The product is stable on a countertop.  It is just the thing for mixing small batches of batter...and about as large a size as one would want for kitchen use.	1
SEOH is the seller, but the beakers are LabZap, Or should I say LabCrap.  The quality from that manufacturer leaves much to be desired.  The several times I have ordered glassware and received LabZap I returned it post-haste.  Imperfections that feel like sand grains, nicks are both typical.  I' ve had enough.  I am DONE buying anything that is LabZap.	-1
I needed some beakers that were of good quality without breaking the bank and these fit the bill nicely.  Arrived quickly and were well packaged and haven't had any problems with them.  Measuring marks are clearly labeled and haven't worn off.	1
Durable, accurate and perfect size for dosing my 200+ gallon marine aquarium.	1
These beakers are functional and pretty good quality. They do what I need them to do and that's be heat resistant containers. My beakers take a serious beating getting bathed in 160-200oF water 3-4 times a week. Sometimes they even get microwaved for short periods of time. I've been using this brand of beakers since last year and like them. Just don't drop them and you'll be set. I've gone through at least 1-2 sets of these beakers plus a few individuals. They don't handle rough play very well. The beakers handled the trip from the Amazon warehouse to me very well. They however did not handle my 2 moves, braking suddenly with them in my car (happened 2 days ago), or being dropped very well. They clean extremely well and stay crystal clear. When it comes to heat, these beakers will have your back all day long. When it comes to physical shock, be prepared to buy new beakers. I don't use the measurements on the front as I have instruments that I use for measuring so I can't comment on their accuracy.  All in all these are a great beakers and work for my purpose. I would recommend these for the hobbyist or the scientist.	1
Great size.  Just what I needed for larger mixtures .	1
love it	1
Thank you!	1
Great beakers! Very good packing material so nothing was broken when the package arrived. For large volume solutions these work perfect!	1
Very pleased with this product. We use it in the kitchen.	1
Quality Glassware for the Price, If you want to Pay little more, go with Karter Scientific.	1
Nice Beaker, at a very good price !	1
Clearly marked --- used daily for measuring and dispensing medications. Frequently put them in the dishwasher, which has a 160 degree sanitizing cycle, and the beakers survive nicely.  Actually only needed the 50 and 100ml sizes, but was less expensive to get the set than just the individual beakers. So I use the 250 ml as an 8 ounce drinking glass.	1
What I needed was one 250ml Beaker. American Science & Surplus Sells. BEAKERS Set of (3) heat resistant glass beakers. You will get (1) each of 250ml, 600ml and 1000ml, all graduated. Great starter set. $15.95 a set. To skip a 60 minutes round trip to the store, I ordered via Amazon: SEOH 3 Pack Glass Borosilicate Graduated Beakers 50ml 100ml and 250ml $3.60 + 4.60 shipping. Received SEOH 3 Pack Glass Borosilicate Graduated Beakers 50ml 100ml and 200ml. Because I spent the money just for a 250ml Beaker and received a not as described 200ml Beaker, the set go in trash and the seller gets 2 Stars for one for 50ml beaker and another for 100 ml beaker which I don't needed.	-1
These are solid beakers, one has broken (but it was operator error). I'd buy these again even if broke the remaining two.	1
fabulous!	1
nice little set of beakers,fairly thick glass and decent markings	1
Good value (borosilicate) for my home wine lab.  I've had good experience with this vendor.	1
Great set, might want to get something higher end if you are trying to save humanity or something and need critical measurement.  If you are a normal person this is all you need.  Might want to hand wash to protect the markings.	1
Exactly as described. Great price, fast shipping, excellent quality	1
Good quality for the price	1
These beakers are great for my intended occasional use.  They arrived in perfect condition, well packaged, and surprisingly within a few days of placing my order. NOTE - The glass is fairly thin so I would assume them to be slightly fragile -  Now, if your intentions are for heavy daily usage or to use them for heating things either for yourself, in a lab, classroom, business, etc. I suggest you pay a little more and get something of higher quality.  FOR MY INTENDED OCCASIONAL USE THEY'RE PERFECT.	1
They do what they're supposed to do. I don't know if they're actually Boroscilicate, but they seem pretty durable.	1
I needed some beakers that were of good quality without breaking the bank and these fit the bill nicely.  Arrived quickly and were well packaged and haven't had any problems with them.  Measuring marks are clearly labeled and haven't worn off.	1
well made set but cost was a bit much so 4 star but the item is good so id buy it again	1
VERY NICE	1
GREAT PRICE AND QUALITY. ARRIVED UNBROKEN.	1
Great value	1
good beakers, works as expected	1
Nice and small, they are exactly what I was looking for to mix and measure my essential oils.	1
You can't really beat 3 beakers for 6 and a half dollars with shipping included. I used these a few times already to mix simple solutions and collect distilled water. I even put them to the test and placed them directly on my stove's red hot burner with only 20ml of water in the bottom to see if they are stable. So far, no breakage! Little to no imperfections in the glass, and markings are clear and easy to read. The thickness of the glass seems to be a little thinner than what I am used to, but so far hasn't been an issue.  My only gripe is that I ordered 2 of these sets, and while they were packaged pretty securely, I still had one beaker break during shipping. The packagers wrap the 50ml beaker in paper, and snuggly fit that in the 100ml beaker, then wrap and fit that in the 250ml beaker before wrapping EVERYTHING in a thick lofty layer of heavy paper. Despite this, one of the 250ml beakers shattered during delivery. I don't think I can fault the seller though. They were haphazardly thrown into a large box with several other unsecured items and I think that is what caused the broken outer beaker. If you order these individually, with no other items, I believe you will have them all arrive in perfect condition. I'm not worried about the broken beaker since I still got a pretty good deal, even with the damage. I'll probably buy more of these in the future.	1
So cool, I always wanted the whole science and chemistry kit back in 1980 and now I'm slowly building it up so I can run various of experiments on my free-time.  These are also handy for heating up oppose to having to use a pot than wash it later!  And the Shipping & Handling was TOP GRADE AAA+++  Thanks!!	1
Real good product and I recommend this item and seller to everyone !	1
there small ...umm your thumb will in the big one	1
I love this cute little set. I use them for mixing essential oils. They are just the right size for measuring tiny amounts of oils to go into nebulizers, body butters, and various types of aromatherapy diffusers. The set I received is just like the set in the photo. All measuring lines are there.	1
I love these things.  Sure they aren't expensive name brand but for the love of Chemistry they work and you don't cry for very long when you drop one and break it! Unless you step on it..	1
These are small. I use them for mixing essential oils, which is perfect.	1
great product	1
Perfect size for small scale hydroponic system!	1
Works well at a great price point. I would only handwash as I am not sure how long the writing would holdup in the dishwasher.  I have a non critical  garden use and it was nice to find something that was affordable.	1
Cute as heck. Little minis	1
Perfect	1
I bought these as I frequently need to measure liquids - mostly for cooking, sometimes for science projects. These beakers work well and are nicely made and the price is right.	1
I ordered these beakers because I thought they were cool, not because I plan on doing any science experiments. They will work out great for parties as a cool drink mixing container. I also plan on using them as props for pictures on my website.  All those smart scientists use these, so now that I use them, I look smarter, right?	1
Unique way for measuring ingredients in the kitchen.	1
These beakers are my go to. Great price and they have lasted through several moves. I've purchased at least 3 of these sets due to needing more beakers for projects or dropping them and needing to replace it. Great price for the set and will keep coming back. My only complaint is that the glass is a little on the thin side so that can create a problem or two. However, for the price, who really cares.	1
great	1
Excellent value.	1
seems fine.	1
all good	1
Great set to replace broken glassware in our lab at a fraction of the price of mainstream industrial suppliers.	1
Nice set.	1
great packaging. no damage at all. Great quality	1
great item	1
Quality glass I didn't notice any deformities They measured well Read the description and you know exactly what your getting	1
Nice little set of graduated cups. Nice quality.	1
Absolutely what I wanted and expected.  Very professional service with timely delivery.  Would Highly recommend!	1
Nice product ,fast shipping.	1
I looked all over for beakers of all different sizes, and I found this set on Amazon, with a prime price, paid for the whole set, what some companies charge for One 1000ml beaker ! And free shipping with Amazon prime, what a great deal !	1
Great product.  Reliable results and good durability.  Good price as well.	1
very good	1
These work great and are decently durable for being glass. Double as shot glasses because of the size. Excellent product.	1
Seems to be well made. Graduations are reasonably accurate, and are well-etched. If you're in the market for a small beaker that can be shipped Prime, you can't go wrong here.	1
Great item, quality, fast ship.	1
I have heated, and frozen this beaker many times now and it has stood up to all the punishment, as all borosilicate glass should.	1

great professional quality	1
Very well made and durable.. It survived an "OH MY GOD" drop on to hardwood flooring from about 4 feet.  it hit the floor, bounced, shook it off and kept on doing it's thing (not breaking).	1
Great beaker, no complaints. Liquid measurements were accurate and class appears free of defects.	1
Good quality and great price ! I recommend this to all !	1
Perfect.	1
I used to boil water in the microwave in mason jars for tea, but they started to crack. This is borosilicate glass and it can take the heat with no problems.	1
Perfect, just what I needed, and a great price by buying them in bulk !	1
great	1
Not top-notch quality but they fixed my bad-bearing issues.  For non-critical applications, these work great!  If you're a stickler for quality but don't want to pay top-dollar for top-notch, this is what I've done in the past.  If you have surgeon hands, you can pull off the seals, soak the bearings in acetone for a couple days.  This will remove the grease.  Once all the grease is gone, let it all dry.  Reinstall seals on one side.  Apply light oil (like 2.5w - 10w).  Reinstall the other seal and the bearings will spin for days before stopping.  Smaller ones may not spin as much, but the process does work.	1
work well	1
These bearing work as expected	1
Product was as advertised, quality seems good.	1
They serve as the exact replacement for bearings that I have on a device I use for testing O Guage Trains.	1
Good size, sturdy, well made and smooth!	1
Review of 5V Mini USB 1A Lithium Battery Charging Board Charger Module I ordered and received this item in 11 days.  The boards were still connected and work as I expected.  If they hold up, each one, considered as a part of the order as a whole, then I will return and give working conditions of each as to whether they are still doing what I expect from them.  Protection and all.	1
works great recommended	1
This 1 amp lithium battery charging board sure takes a long time to recharge a partially discharged 3000mAh battery. Either my battery is grossly under rated or the charger is grossly over rated. I tried with different 5V sources from 500ma to 2.1amp and the charge current stayed at between 155ma and 160ma. 16% of rated output. That is like a 900mAh battery rated at 6000mAh ( I think I've bought a couple of those) I have another one coming from Amazon today so I'll see if I got a defective unit or if I got two over rated units. UPDATE 09/11/15: Using a USB charge cable that came with a 26000mAh battery bank the charge current is up to 550ma. I should have known that on a fixed income I can't afford to buy cheap. The charge current does drop as the battery (cell) charges until just prior to cutoff at 4.2V the charge rate is about 20ma. UPDATE 09/14/15: The charge current decreases as the battery charges, starting at about 1000ma w/battery at 3.2V and decreasing to about 100ma at charge termination at 4.2V. Most of the charging (between 3.5V & 4.1V ) is at between 800ma & 600ma. My next update will be with the module hard wired to a 5V source. (no USB cables)	1
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.	1
Great	1
Used this in a few of my box mod builds and it works great. Light is red while charging and either blue or green when fully charged. I would defiantly recommend this product.	1
i don't need 100 of them but o well	1
work well for my project thank	1
These are resistors. They work fine. They are packaged nicely. They ship fast. Apparently, I have to say something unique about these resistors, vs the other E-Projects resistors, despite the fact that they are identical in every way but value. Otherwise, Amazon thinks I am spamming. Bite me, Amazon.	1
what can i said working fine, and great price.	1
great product, would buy again, from E-projects	1
They work so far so good My robot is working fine using  a truckload of them	1
excellent	1
work great with no problems	1
Just what I needed to completed my project, Thank you	1
Awesome	1
Great price. I have used most of them without any fails.	1
Bought this to replace the "Stuck-open" chuck on my 18V Dewalt drill/driver. It is less than 1/4 the cost of the Dewalt replacement, operates smoother and appears to be just as, or more, durable than the original.	1
Makes an inexpensive drill an awesome and useful drill.	1
DID NOT GET A SERIES 700 JACOBS CHUCK AS PER THE AD, I GOT A SERIES 500 JACOBS CHUCK. THIS IT, SEEM WAS A HONEST MISTAKE  THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED A CREDIT FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICE AND I AM GOING TO KEEP THE CHUCK.	1
A properly installed drill bit wobbles about 1/16" off center at the tip after many reinstalls. The nose of this chuck wobbles too. The Chinese who manufactured this chuck have cheated me. The reason I gave this thing one star is because I had not the option of zero stars. This is truly some sort of revenge on American citizens. Now I'm screwed out of almost $20.	-1
Nice looking and very durable, and for a great price.	1
I was installing a Priority Start on a dual battery diesel truck so I needed to separate one battery cable from the clamp that went on the Priority Start. I cut the cable just short of the clamp, stripped the insulation, and connected it to one of these. I then attached it to the post of the other battery using the tightening bolt on the Priority Start. As others have noted you have to sand the coating off the end that has the hole in it. The "set screw" is a big, sturdy screw that expands the strands of the battery cable as it is screwed down until it is held securely and there is good electrical contact.	1
As advertised	1
Seem very nice and work great if the wire is soldered first. Kind wish they had clamp or compression style connections for the wire instead of crushing it with a set screw.	1
GREAT	1
Excellent connectors!	1
Needed a few battery terminals for an aftermarket radio install as well as an LED light bar kit and these fit the bill nicely.  Not only do they work well they look good doing it.	1
Worked perfectly.  Good product.  Worked as designed.	1
Works great but eyes are too small had to drill it bigger to fit bolts.	1
Great quality!	1
yeah these things are well made and i want more. So much better than standard terminals	1
Don't use on anything except Audio.	-1
This product is VERY cheaply made.  I was disappointed when I received it to find that it's just a printed piece of paper inside the glass for the hydrometer portion.  I will be purchasing something else.  Don't waste your money.	-1
Seems to do its job but until I have a better understanding of what the little bugger is doing, it stays on the shelf. I'd rather drink the cider than read about it. :-)	1
If your making your own home brew you need one of these Hydrometers. Very pleased with the protection in shipping.	1
I have been using this hydrometer for a few months and I love it. It calibrated right on the money, and is super easy to read. It even came with a nice little conversion chart to help you estimate the alcohol content of your homebrew. It was packaged nice and tight in a padded plastic case (which i'm still storing it in) and in perfect condition. I have owned a few different hydrometers and this one is definitely my favorite. If I break this one, I will certainly be re-ordering it!	1
ok	1
great glass construction. Does the job.	1
Good hydrometer that is easy to use and store.  Plastic storage case is nice to use but care must be taken to avoid pushing two halves together too hard and breaking instrument.	1
It works just like it should.  Came in a sturdy case so breaking it wasn't a problem.  Reads accurately. Well built.	1
Have not used it yet and will update when I do.  For now I wanted to make sure people are aware you have to buy the test jar to float this in separately. I may not have read the whole description but if you need two items for something to work why would they not be sold together? Anyway don't make the mistake I did and find out like I did after it arrived. Also there are some on here that come with all required parts so take that into consideration when comparing prices of apples and oranges.	1
The hydrometer is fine. It has the color scale and as far as I can tell it's accurate. Calibrated to 60deg F so be sure and adjust based on temperature of the substance. It worked fine until my friend broke it. No fault of the product. You will break these things if not careful.  The test tube is another story. Do not expose it to strong alcohol. (rubbing alcohol, spirits, etc). It will turn into a cracked up mess and is now trash. I would recommend a glass test cylinder or if plastic maybe a different type that will withstand it.	1
Must have to store tester	1
works great	1
A good probe storage solution is hard to find. This was a life saver I purchased mine when I bought my meter and that has been almost 5 months ago and I still have almost a full bottle. It keeps very well, beyond satisfied.	1
It seems to work well	1
The Scotch Fingerprint Lifting Tap is as clear as glass, offering a perfect view. The tape tears easily by hand, but starting that tear is not as easy as it is once the edge has been started. At just over thirty cents per yard, this is a great value for this ultra-transparent lifting tape.	1
This product is a package of 6 rolls of tape (not the image shown on the Amazon product page at present) which are designed for professionals to lift and preserve fingerprints. The tape can be used by anyone for this or similar purposes. It performs the task fairly well. You will need a way to cut the tape by using a scissors/knife or tape dispenser. Also, wear gloves if possible when handling the tape to avoid getting your own prints on it. I've been studying about palmistry and hand prints analysis for understanding life patterns and spiritual paths, and fingerprints are an important component of this practice, so this tape can be useful to archive prints. Considering the amount of this specialized tape included here Amazon offers a decent price.	1
I learned that for evidence to be strongly supported, it's necessary to first take a photo before using the lifting tape. To use this tape correctly, wear gloves - very inexpensive to get a box of disposable gloves. Apply fingerprint powder. Secure lifting tape on both sides of the print, leaving room to spare of course, and use the edge of a card to lightly press the tape. Slowly remove tape and make a written record. That easy.	1
First before my review, please note that you are not getting what is pictured--you are getting rolls of tape.  My two granddaughters are curious about everything in the world.  We are going to go visit the CSI exhibit at one of the casinos next month so I thought this would be a good learning tool for them.  Fingerprint identification or dactyloscopy (good word to use to explain orgins and to practice spelling 'hard' words) has experts comparing the ridged impressions on the fingers. Since, like snowflakes (another learning moment) no two fingerprints are alike - fingerprints can be used to identify people for several purposes.  A classification system is used that is probably too complex for them at their grammar school ages, but any opportunity to introduce some math is one not to be missed, right? So there are many potential learning opportunities to combine with the tape that will interest them and help them with spelling, language, math, history, science etc.  So I'm off to design a grammar school "lesson" plan to incorporate the tape into our CSI casino exhibit visit.  Also, if you don't have a dispenser probably getting one would facilitate getting the tape off the rolls. I have one from a packing tape package. You might be able to find a cheapie for $2 or $3 or ask friends and neighbors that have moved recently they may have one. It really will help keep your fingerprints off the tape!	1
The photo on this product is incorrect.  It should picture rolls of tape, because that is what you get.  It is a lot of tape for the price.  (10 yd per roll)  If you do not have a dispenser you will not be able to get the tape off without getting all of YOUR fingerprints all over it.  We didn't care since we were just using it in our house to examine the differences in my kids fingerprints.  They were pretty easy to see and distinguish different patterns.	1
Great tape, makes a great project for science class, or on a rainy day.  With an ink pad and some flocking powder, we made a very fun and interesting learning activity.	1
This Scotch Fingerprint Lifting Tape comes in 2" wide rolls, not the sheets shown in the product picture. Aquick YouTube search showed us how to use this using baby powder and we set off pulling fingerprints off counters around our small shop. This tape worked well and was easier to use than regular packing tape. This was a fun experiment and we will see if the local Police Department want the rest of rolls we didn't use.  Recommended!  CFH	1
First of all (if the picture on Amazon has not been corrected yet), this is six rolls of 2 inch wide 10 yards long tape, not a big rectangular sheet.  This came just at the right time when my 9-year old kid just visited the Spy Museum in Washington DC and at the same time practicing fingerprint lifting in their science subject at school using talc powder and mommy's facial brush.  The tape is a specialty tape and costs as such.  It is designed to be transparently clear and easy to conform even on curved surfaces like door knobs.  We used baby powder and soot created by a candle on the bottom of a steel cup as opposed to the real black or bi-chromatic powder. Tried on a mirror surface and counter top.  Overall, a very educational experience for my kid.	1
I am not currently law enforcement, nor CSI. I am a computer guy that wanted to try out an experiment so when I had the chance to try this fingerprint tape out I jumped at it. I got the tape for a little iphone fingerprint sensor test to see if I could pull someones fingerprint using the tape and trick an iPhone 5 into unlocking. I won't give away the results but I can say it was interesting.  I will add however I did go through a police academy and did a lot of fingerprinting in my local community for various events and this was much easier then the methods I used in the past during my training. As I said though I am not currently in that field so I can't speak to any better techniques they have started using in the last 10 years.  The tape comes in rolls, it tears very easily so you don't have to go hunt down scissors. It is very clear and easy to use and does a great job at lifting and preserving fingerprints.  If you are looking for a way to capture and preserve fingerprints then this works really well and I would recommend it, I can't see any fault with it.	1
As I have a background in criminal law, I was pressed into service by a friend to assist in designing birthday activities for her CSI crazed son. This tape worked well.  Designed for forensic use, it is clear and appropriately sticky. The tape is easy to tear and use. It comes in rolls, not in the sheets that are pictured and there is no dispenser included.  I can envision it as part of a fun curriculum at schools or parties in addition to its professional purpose. If you are not familiar with forensic evidence collection, there are many resources online which provide the basics for free. Like most things it is not quite as easy as it looks and practice makes perfect. This tape functions as it should. I cannot speak to its archival qualities but it is moisture resistant. I see no reason why it should not withstand long time storage. While ideal for forensic use, it could also be a wonderful educational tool for creative teachers and parents. Recommended.	1
works	1
Quality product, fast discreet shipping.  Can be cut to size as well.	1
works great	1
Perfect, anti-friction layer. Tough enough to reuse, cost effective.	1
This is much better than wax or parchment paper. Cost a little more but well worth it.	1
I use these in my Harvest Right trays - I can easily loosen the vegetables and fruits and rest that would have been frozen to the trays.  Reusable.  Durable enough	1
not what I was expecting but it is what it says it is, I used it a few times but I don't need this for what I am doing however its a good product	1
This parchment paper is top-of-the-line but they need to make bigger rolls these rules there's only such little paper available in them your run out so quick and for the price it's kind of a rip off for the price but other than that I'm very satisfied with this product I really wish that you guys would make the 4x4 Square sheets like this I think you guys do on Instagram I'm not sure I'll have to check you guys out on Instagram	1
good product, a little expensive, but works great	1
Blasting right onto this left me unable to remove the concentrate afterwards. I wasted quit a bit trying to remove it. Finally gave up and rinsed in a pyrex container I had just blasted into to remove the concentrate. Others have had good luck with this product so I can't say it doesn't work all the time. I'm not sure what I did differently from those who used it without trouble.	-1
great product,works as described would order from them again,good price--fast delivery.	1
Great product	1
Useful kit with an assortment of transistors for small projects.	1
for the money you cant go wrong	1
If you really are serious about making new circuits, being toys or serious designs you shall buy this bag.  I like that the selection comes with everything you need for now or future projects, price is fantastic, what can you loose?  I recommend it for hobbyists.	1
I'm no expert and am not sure when to use a particular transistor, they all seem pretty interchangeable (although at least one is PNP not NPN, which caught me out). There is a range here, they work, and came when promised so no complaints.	1
100 pcs Rectifier Diode Tape kit,1N4148 1N4007 1N5819 1N5399 FR107 FR207...used it as a specific replacement diode, bought the packet cheaper than one or two.. Worth the price for a shelf part when you need one.	1
Great	1
Nice selection of diodes.	1
As advertised, though not on tape, but that's NBD. Great component assortment, cheap.	1
Bought several sets of these..Nice selection of Diodes for my middle school students to create circuits with... and inexpensive enough for broke little me !!!	1
Great deal on some very commonly used diodes.	1
High quality parts for one of a kind projects, or just learning electronics.  To address a few complaints; The bags have printed labels on each bag. The bags are thin. If you're going to keep them in the bags, use some clear tape on the edges. Two sizes, 1N5408 and 1N5822, have very thick leads. You WILL NOT be able to use them in a plastic breadboard, these two are for high power projects. All the others will fit into a breadboard without any problem. My order was shipped from the USA on a "next day free shipping" order.  Highly recommended.	1
This pack contains a great variety of commonly used rectifier diodes and will fit nicely into any hobbyist component collection. For the price, you can't beat this deal, and the quality is A+. I haven't used all of them yet, as I don't use diodes often in my projects, but I feel comfortable in saying that when the time comes, these diodes will fit the purpose, and I can be confident in knowing that they won't fail.  I definitely recommend these diodes, and would buy again (should I need to considering the quantity included.)	1
I have used eight of these without issue.	1
Most hobbies will have a use for every one of these diodes. There are more or the most common ones like the 1n4148 and the 1n4007 and less of the less common values.	1
Product was as advertised, quality seems good.	1
I'm satisfied with the product.	1
Really nice clamp.  The jaws open nice and wide and have long fingers so even a Freidrichs condenser is held adequately by these clamps.	1
Very nice clamp, good craftsmanship. Sturdy, stable, and a good value.	1
ok	1
...the adjusted length as measured from the support rod is not adequate for me.  I feel there should be an additional length of one to two inches from the rod clamp.	1
Works great for holding things - has plastic cover when holding charged items - works well for hot/cold items and have used these for holding a torch while soldering/brazing items - have not used for holding test tubes - also bought the stand and another smaller clamp - inexpensive and well made can clamp down surprisingly tight - would recommend.	1
It holds my Erlenmeyer flasks and makes me feel like a mad scientist.	1
great	1
Works as advertised	1
Good quality clamp. I like the padded grips and the adjustability of the clamp. Easy to use, reliable and the price was reasonable.	1
hard to put into words how great this is	1
Excellent quality, and worked perfect	1
So far, the clamps do well holding the glass and maintains the elevation when connected to the pole. Since it is less than a month old in use, I cannot provide data on longevity.	1
Good deal	1
Solid, secure and nice wide opening. Rusted when used outdoors, but to be expected	1
These are the best clamps I own. Easy to use and cheap. I would recommend removing the PVC coating if you will be using it to grip glass that is going over 100 c.  Then just paint the fingers with high temp BBQ or engine block paint to protect the glass. All in all a great deal.	1
Great item.  Very good quality and works great with our lab setup.	1
The only clamp that could hold my 3" inside diameter Pyrex lab drain vacuum chamber.  It has a wing nut in the center you can loosen to allow rotating the claw.	1
it was broke when I got it	-1
I love this clamp.  The coated prongs grip flasks and condensers on contact, and very little tightening is required to hold the flask or condenser in place.  I also like that I don't have to worry about creating too much pressure on the glassware.  I'm always checking the condenser or 500 ml boiling flask to see if there's any danger of them slipping, but everytime I give a little tug to see if I can move them they don't budge while being held with these clamps.  I'll eventually stop doing that and realize that these clamps can be trusted to do the job.	1
very good	1
this is what you need for heavier glassware.  works really good.	1
Great Product!	1
Works great!	1
Standard lab grade equipment. Works fine.	1
Good clamp for the money.  I've seen much worse and not many a whole lot better.  Good to keep several handy.  I've ordered like clamps from different sources, just to compare.  This is a better one.	1
Arm is durable, accommodating and simple.	1
This Eisco Labs Clamp Retort, with 3 PVC Coated Prongs is very good quality and works better than expected! This is adjustable and the rubberized prongs hold glassware very securely.  Highly Recommended!  CFH	1
Works great and very well made with sturdy screws with no play in them.	1
Excellent product and service.  Would recommend.	1
I didn't get the recommended spray bottles for the product and it was a bust to try7 and apply it with an off the shelf sprayer.	-1
Nice little valve, better than the plastic spigot it replaced on my camper water tank.  I used a 3/8" elbow to finish it off.  Smooth action for turning.  Only a slight resistance at start of opening, which I think is necessary to provide some feedback.	1
awesome, leak free little ball valve	1
worked nicely	1
Good	1
Handy to have around. Great price.	1
It says so right on the label.	-1
as described	1
Works well.	1
Works well with large carboys and 6 gal buckets	1
I needed a way to fill my kombucha bottles and after using a funnel a few times decided there has to be a better way. Amazon to the rescue...  This device is simple in the design and works effortlessly. The only issue I have had and not a fault of the device was overfilling the bottles as you need to kinda guess the amount of liquid in the tube that will drain into your bottle once vacuum is broken. I fixed this issue with the addition of a hose shut off clamp. Now when the bottle gets close to full I squeeze the clamp and know exactly how much kombucha is going to drain into my bottle,	1
Works great. Still use a wine theft for small samples.	1
Good product	1
Item as described.	1
Works fine, relatively easy to clean.	1
Made it so much more simple.. 1-2 quick pumps and it handles the rest.  Wish I had it sooner	1
Love it	1
what i needed	1
I use this to transfer my Kombucha from my gallon jug to the bottles.  Works well and is easy to prime with a pumping action.  I put the gallon jug on the microwave and let gravity do its thing after it is primed and liquid starts to flow.  Cleans easily with pumping hot water through it but I don't know if I would use it for boiling hot liquids.	1
Great buy and works great	1
Excellent siphon. Does a great job getting nearly all of the liquid out of your vessel. The only thing I would like to have seen is a screen incorporated to prevent pulp and sediment from being transferred through it. Overall it works quite well though and is very convienient. I would purchase it again.	1
as described	1
workes fine	1
works as listed	1
Siphon works great. Give it a few pumps and let gravity do the rest	1
used this to siphon off some hard cider. works great and lees stay in bottom. don't disturb container while transferring fluid	1
Great little inexpensive tool for the at home brewer. Very happy with the purchase.	1
Great item for any wine making job	1
These are awesome. I use them to move several cars around on my property. I know right where to stop instead of guessing and hitting other cars.	1
Very sturdy, but much bigger than I was expecting or then I really needed but great quality.	1
Great for visibility for sectioning off a parking lot. Very quick delivery. Reasonable price. Highly recommended.	1
Product is sturdy, high visibility, love the hook on the top to tie caution tape to.  The reflective bands on top are great as well.  Heavy base, won't be knocked over by normal winds.  Only reason I didn't give a  5 star is that these can not be stacked for storage, the orange "tube" portion is not tapered.  The base can easily be removed to help with storage a bit, but for my situation I'm going to have to stack and strap multiple orange tubes and figure out somewhere in the garage to let them sit between my rare uses for them.	1
Perfect for what I needed	1
Much larger and heavier than expected.  Was going to use to help precisely place 2 cars in a smaller home garage.  Cones were in the way all the time because they were too large.  Took up too much garage room and had to be frequently moved and then realigned.	-1
Disappointed. Too soft for metal chain. Can only use plastic chain with these or it pulls them over.	-1
Very well made.	1
Just what I wanted: A safety cone just like the road crews use!	1
These are well-built and sturdy.  I like the size.  And they're heavy enough that you don't have to worry about them moving around or falling over.  They are also very visible.  And these were some of the lowest priced cones I could find in this size.	1
A very good product! Fit for purpose.	1
Using it to prevent guests from tripping over the base of my stair chair. Just super cool! No one will miss this!	1
sufficient.	1
I actually was very impressed with this little vacuum. It is well designed, and performed admirably in all my tests.  Things I liked about it: 1) Excellent suction. At the end of the day, the thing that matters most in a vacuum is suction power, and this one has exceptional suction. 2) Light Weight - We have a two story house, and this unit is lightweight enough to be easy to use on the stairways and to carry around. 3) Noise- Noise level is acceptable and while all vacuums are loud this one seems a little quieter than normal ones. 4) Cord- Cord is nice and long, and has a well designed spring loaded retractor. 5) Adjustable Suction- If you want to use it on drapes or other delicate material, it has a knob that allows you to turn the suction power down if needed. 6) Nice telescoping feature on the vacuum head . . . allows you to quickly extend the vacuum wand to reach up into corners and ceiling areas. 7) Some nice and useful attachments to help you get into various small places.  Things I did not like: 1) Right about where your thumb holds the vacuum, there is a sliding plastic piece that opens a hole to turn suction off to the main suction head. the problem is that as you vacuum there is a tendency for you to accidentally slide this piece. It is annoying. I am sure I will "learn" not to do it over time, but think this "feature" could have been better thought out.  Overall this is a well designed and well built product. I have always been pleased with Bissell products, and this one did not disappoint. It is probably not suitable to be your main carpet vacuum but is nice for kitchen work, hardwood floors, bathroom, and stairs. All of those odd jobs your upright does not handle well. Bottom line is I am delighted with this product!	1
The first thing I noticed about the BISSELL CleanView with OnePass, 9595, was its lightweight. I appreciate this! Lugging around a heavy weight is no fun. I have been known to lift the whole vac to sweep the seats of furniture, as I have a golden mix dog and cats who do tend to shed on the sofa and chairs. Just to be clear, the BISSELL CleanView with OnePass, 9595 also has a rotary brush attachment that I use on the rest of the furniture and it does a dandy job!  The second thing that impressed me was that the size overall is much smaller than my older vacuum. I can get it UNDER the tv stand and furniture up to a point, and the attachments provided do the rest. All of the attachments are stored on board and are easy to get to and easy to put right back where they belong.  And on the topic of easy, let me say that cleaning out the CleanView itself could not be easier. Not only does the dirt tank pop right off and open at the bottom to emty into the trash, but the filters unscrew and can be washed under the tap and air dried. This should keep this machine in good working order for a long time. No struggling to take it apart, and no need to replace the filters, just clean them. Very environmentally friendly.  I like this.. I like it a lot.  I would like to have a slightly longer cord, but that is the only and very small drawback I can find. While this cord is slightly longer than the one on my las vac, I still think that another foot or two would be helpful.	1
Wife loves this small powerful vacuum.	1
First day's use so I will come back and update if need be but... After reading all of the 1k+ reviews for this (it's the same as the model 6565A that is just another color) and going through all the answered questions, I'm pretty happy that I made this choice. Another reviewer called this "a beast" because of how well it cleans and they are so right! PROS: 1 - This is not a quiet machine but it is not as loud as I expected from a couple of other reviews. My cheap little Dirt Devil is just as loud and doesn't pick up anything but surface debris. The suction is amazing. You only have to choose the correct floor height setting. My carpet was dingy from spot cleaning, then using a low power vacuum. After a year's worth of hidden dirt, this vac really dug down and grabbed all kinds of dander-like debris. I'm sure this will be good for my breathing. You can see in the photo what I picked up with the Bissell after already having gone over the carpet 3 times with the Dirt Devil. Basically, my carpets have never been vacuumed! 2- It's not as heavy as some reviewers mention. Even on the lowest floor height setting, I had no problems using this (and I have back problems and low strength). 3- The cord is long enough that I don't' have to unplug when moving around my small apartment. 4 - There was no "spit-back" of debris like with some vacs. 5 - That dust canister is awesome! So easy to take off, dump, then reattach. That was a relief because emptying the dirt is my least favorite part of vacuuming. 6 - This wasn't too hard to put together. (You can see the attached photo for what it looked like out of the box and unassembled.) I timed myself and finished in just under 20 minutes. The only problem I had was that my eyes are not great and I took a lot of time re-reading the steps in the instructions. HINT: turn your vacuum around so that it matches the diagram in the instructions! 7- This maneuvers well enough for an upright. I did have to be careful to use both hands to stretch the hose when using attachments so I didn't yank the vacuum over. 8 - This fits in my entryway closet very easily (SEE PIC). When you live in a small apartment, storage is at a premium. I like that this stores where I can just roll it out to use it and put it back out of the way.  CONS: 1- The power button is in an odd spot. Like I said, I have back problems and I had to bend to reach the button. I understand why it's placed there though because of how the hose and the release take up the spaces at the bottom. 2- The hose could be a tad bit longer. It's long enough when the vac is not running, but the suction compresses it and I needed to use both hands to pull it to full length.  I really love this on Day 1. As someone else reviewed that if this lasts a year, I will be more than happy.  One tip I want to pass along is that the Bare Floor setting is also okay for very low carpets. It says that in the manual, but I somehow missed it. I picked up a lot more dirt when I lowered the head.  I included some Before and After photos of the carpet so you could get an idea of how well the vac cleaned it. I took one of them last night and one today so they might not line up properly, but there is a HUGE difference.  By the way, I went for the Teal color but, to tell the truth, I don't really pay that much attention to it now that I have it. This is the best vacuum I have ever used and my brother has one of the famous high-end ones that I can't even afford to borrow lest I break it! This one works just as good - although it's a bit louder.	1
The vacuum is very cute, easy to put together, and light and rolls easily while using. I compare this very favorably to my Shark Vac model NP320 40, and it sells for half the price or less. I like the construction on this one much better than the 2156A model because the wand is metal and the attachments click in and are held in place while the other model just slides together. It hasn't made it more functional for me, but just feels better quality. My Shark, on the other hand is constantly coming apart at the handle because it relies on suction to hold it together. Like my Shark this vac is not really meant for carpets, but any kind of wood, tile, terrazzo, or vinyl floor will be a snap to clean with this Zing vac. I wish it had reusable filters, I hate unnecessary trash, and I do have to empty the bags in this every time I use it, since I mostly use it on cobwebs in my garage and house. If I leave the bag in, it doesnt take long for the spiders to come right back out.  Then theres the expense of buying new bags, the cost $2.62 each at the time of this review, for a 6 pack total of $15.70.. At 10.5w x 14.5l x 12h, its super easy to store. The suction power is great, and at least as strong as my shark, and the 10 foot reach makes it easy to clean the cobwebs off my ceilings without having to pick it up. On carpets though, this vac is fairly useless. You can pick up a spill with it, but for getting normal use dirt out of carpet youll want a different vacuum. Overall though I like it.	1
It has been absolutely YEARS since I have used a canister vacuum and when I had an opportunity to give this one a try I jumped at the chance.  I only had one reservation and that was working this vacuum with my back problems.  I have been disabled since 2001 with degenerative disc disease and substantial arthritis in my back.  I have been told that vacuuming was the absolute worst thing I could do with my back in the condition that it is in.  The doctor was talking about the uprights I'm sure. Well my concerns were of naught.  I have been using this canister vacuum with no problems.  I LOVE the retractable cord feature.  When I am thru with vacuuming I love being able to push a button and watch the cord retract into the machine.  FUN! The dust bag is easy to remove and the variable suction when I move from carpet to floors is sweet.  It only requires the push of a button to make that adjustment in the brush heads. I really enjoy this Bissell product.	1
I have been using upright style vacuums for years but have become frustrated by some of their limitations. When I got the chance to try the Bissell Zing 2154A canister vac I jumped at the chance and I'm happy I did.  Compared to years of upright vacuums pushing the hose connected foot brush head on my Zing over my carpets is much lighter and easier. I can get under tables and in places I could not with my upright. With my upright I could pull out a couple of plastic tubes and have a short hose for non-floor cleaning. Again with the Zing it's much easier to get the job done. Dragging around the canister could be a pain but the Zing has good sized wheels that won't get hung-up on deep carpet or a reasonable doorway threshold. I guess my point is the canister is nicer to use for floors and other cleaning in my use.  After I got the Zing I looked around at other canister models/brands and the Zing was one of the least expensive (as of this review). It comes with 2 bags,  floor brush head, crevice tool,  dusting brush head, hose, curved handle attached to hose, telescoping wand (tube), instruction booklet (heavy on illustrations and light on instructions!), and the vacuum base unit. At just 9lbs and drawing just 9A of electricity it's fairly light in weight and power consumption.  There are 2 foam filters in the unit and both can be rinsed to keep them clear. These are not hypo allergenic. The 14ft power cord seems about 4ft short compared to my uprights. It does not matter in my smallish home but may in a large one. I *really* like the automatic retraction feature. The floor unit adjusts from hard floors to deep carpet. I don't have deep pile carpet but my medium pile cleaned up well.  I like the Zing. It's a pretty decent vacuum that has good suction while remaining light weight. It has thoughtful design features that reflect the long experience of Bissell with making good vacuum cleaners. I'm sure there will be times I still use my upright (keep it upstairs maybe?) but I think the Bissell Zing at its low price point (compared to others) represents an excellent value. It's made and works better than I would expect at the price. Exceeding my expectations gets a solid 5 stars from me. I also like the purple color.	1
This vacuum has two strikes against it:  * Bags: Vacuum bags are a hassle. They're a bummer to change and it's a drag trying to find replacements that work with your unit. To me, bags are a throwback to bygone days. While there are a lot of things that I loved about the simplicity of yesteryear, I won't ever forget how much vacuum bags suck.  * Canister: Canister vacuums take two hands to operate. This feels so unnecessary to me, especially since good upright vacuums are so ubiquitous. Using a canister vac seems like an additional step backwards.  If you can look past the bags and the canister style, this is an OK vacuum. It has decent sucking power and the wand is handy enough. The one great thing about the wand over an upright is that the wand is already in your hand, so there really isn't any excuse to poke the wand down in the couch cushions and suck out the couch-crumblies that our kids and dirty visitors seem to leave behind.  This vacuum truly isn't even close to my favorite, but it's a decent device for limited budgets and small floor plans. Just remember to stock up on replacement bags before the holidays, because the bags are really only good for one Christmas tree's worth of needles.	-1
The Bissell Zing is light enough to carry around, but has great sucking power. One of the best I have tried for an inexpensive smaller vacuum. It does the job of a bigger vacuum and is not very loud. I found that it will follow me around very well when it is flat on the floor, it pulls easily. The cord is long and  is retractable. This feature seems to work well. The on/off is also can be controlled by your foot. The bags are about $16. for 6 bags. Most vacuums except for the very expensive models come with a hard plastic hose which works less than one would like. The zing hose is no exception, though it is more pliable than most. The hose connects well to the vacuum and large floor head. There are two other very tiny attachments, a brush end and a thin small space end. The larger head comes with a retractable "squeegee" and brush. It can be lowered so it sticks out slightly or brought up to make the flush with the bottom of the head. I assume that this is for the change between use on a carpet or a hard floor. Their are no directions for its use for this feature. Overall, the direction are poor. It is all pictures, (drawings) and I find this less than adequate. It is very difficult to push the floor head on carpet. It does not have wheels that allow this to be pushed easily. Most carpet vacuuming must be done by pulling the head. The 4 stars rather than 5 stars is primarily because of the hose, pushing the head and the directions, it does a good job doing what it should, suck.	1
For the price you pay, this thing just works. It's no Dyson, but then again, I'm only paying a fraction of what a Dyson cost. The only reason I'm docking 1 star is the noise. It's noticeably louder than my previous 2 vacuums that are around the same $75 - $100 price point.	1
I like this vacuum a lot. It has a variable dial which is great for upholstery and what not. The best part is it also works great in the car, so you don't need a shop vac if you have this thing! Great for those who don't have a ton of space as well. I use a bag, so you have to decide if you want that, but the bags are cheap and last a long time. I use bags because they are better for allergies, but otherwise, I would prefer not to generate the extra waste. My girlfriend is not a big of a fan of this vacuum as me, she says it is hard to manoeuvre around, so consider that!  On a side note, every time I look at this thing, I think it would be pretty easy to turn into a backpack, so ill keep you updated if I ever do that!	1
I love it and would buy it again. This was my first Amazon deal purchase like new grade I believe. The box was a mess, but it was brand new and never used. Great way to save money!  PROS: Great suction! It is a change for me because my old vacuum didn't stick to the hardwood like this one. It also has an easy to use barefloor/carpet switch on the floor thingy. It's very light. Bag change looks easy. I like the big off button on the top. It moves around nice or can be easily carried. Comes with extra bags which is nice plus one was already in it.  CONS: The handle you hold is an odd shape/thickness, the cord retractor will probably break eventually, comes with two tools and only one tool can store on it (as far as I can tell) and it usually falls off at some point so just put the tools in a drawer somewhere.  Overall very pleased for the price paid and a great deal! I customized my on/off and cord retract buttons with a Sharpie paint pen. (See pic.)	1
Wow, best vacuum cleaner we have had. I like the light weight and suction power. Great that bags are not needed. Like the attachments for the steps. Also, compared to my previous vacuum, this vacuum is  not as loud which is great for us and our pets.	1
I bought two-- the price was GREAT!!! This little thing is a mighty mite!! I use one of them on my balcony -- it sucks up dried leaves and other detritus and asks for more. Powerful suction. Plenty of attachments -- BUT I DO regarding that little black plastic band that covers the hole just above the place where the hose attaches-- I wish it was tighter-- I had to use rubber bands to keep it from sliding up ALL TOO OFTEN, and interrupting the suction effect.	1
We have two girls and being a bit of a neat freak, I run the vacuum daily. I was using a Dyson that seemed fine but I noticed it was not picking up quite as well as it had. It was time for a new vacuum but the Dyson had not bowled me over so I decided to buy a cheaper model and perhaps replace it more often. M. Browns review convinced me to give this vacuum a try. I was shocked at how much this picked up from my clean floors. I have attached the picture of what came up from just our 20 x 15 living room. My neat freak, germophobe self nearly fell over! This is definitely THE vacuum to buy! Thank you M. Brown!	1
You can't really go wrong with a Bissell vacuum. It works well, is designed well, and this new bagless design gets rid of the recurring bag expense and hassle. The price is excellent for this level of quality. Honestly, you will probably be using this same vacuum ten years from now unless you drop it out a window or something. Five stars.	1
Great little vacuum.  Provides serious suction in an easy-to-carry package.  Comes with a couple of attachments and a clip for one of them.  Would rate 5 stars except that cord retractor does not always "behave" as it should.	1
Good for apartment cleaning	1
Powerful and portable.	1
So far this little vacuum in great.  Used a couple of times now.  Lightweight, easy to carry around.  Suction is good too - as long as the hole in the handle is closed.  Don't like the crevice tool - would have been nice to not cheap out on that one and make two tools, not just one that flips up; I find this tool useless.  The other downside is the length of the electrical cord - would have been nice to have been longer; have to plug it in several times to finish the house.  I had another vacuum that had a 30-ft hose and that was better.  The floor attachment works good on very low pile rugs/carpet; but don't expect it to really clean a carpet well - I don't think it is designed to do this.  This little vacuum is perfect for our use since 95% of the house is hardwood flooring.  No scratches on my floors like some of the feedback from others.	1
This has the best suction of any vacuum cleaner I have, even the Oreck XL.  This digs down in between floor boards and just sucks its heart out.  I took the attachment out for some hard places but not often.  WE have hundred year old hardwood floors upstairs and sadly someone just turns on a Roomba upstairs (that would be me) and calls it good.  I have been taken to school by this vacuum.	1
As advertised, received promptly. Very satisfied.	1
I worry about the lifespan of this vacuum due to the lightweight plastic used on the entire body. So far so good though and we will see how it holds up over time.  This is the lowest priced vacuum I have ever owned, and I have owned many, many over the years. Prior to this one, my current vacs were all Electrolux. I had 3, for different areas/floors of the house because I hate having to lug one up and down the steps. One of them wasn't working so well anymore and so I've been wanting to replace it.  This Bissell really surprised me with its performance. It does a great job of getting pet hair and dust out of the carpets and most of all the carpets actually look better/more fluffed up than when I use my other vac.  Emptying the dust container is easy but has the same hassles as any other bagless, so I can't complain.  It's the way the lid opens to the side that you just have to be careful or end up with a mess.  There's no cloth or sponge type filter in the main dust container area, so nothing to clean and let dry. It's a plastic slotted filter, so you can just tap it off and/or wipe it down quickly and right back to vacuuming.  I feel like the one pass technology is mostly true. I do more than one pass of course though since we have multiple pets and i will go over the entire room several times before I feel like I am done, but that is the case with any vacuum that I'd use. It does seem to get more dust and debris up, more quickly than with my other vac, so that is why I say the one pass is mostly true. It of course will depend on your carpets and how much stuff is in/on them, but it does seem to have great power as of now.  I typically vacuum everyday, but may skip a day here and there. I have been using this vacuum a few weeks now and I really don't have any complaints about it. That in itself is surprising because I am so picky with vacuums.  The fact that you can get such an affordable one that works so well still blows my mind. The real test is the test of time though because if it only lasts a year or so it's not really worth it in the long run. I rather invest in a good one that will do a great job and last many years. We will see how this one holds up and keeps suction power over time. I'll update my review if I run into any issues and/or if/when it decides to die on me. With 3 pets and kids, grandkids, and daycare, I really put a vacuum through a lot of usage.	1
Great	1
Bissell has had this design for a few years and keep tweaking it.  I'd prefer a model with retractable chord.  Like most similar models it can be loud.  But the design for removing debris in the central tank is good.	1
Day 4 of use but a ton of suction and working great. This model doesnt have retractable cord that breaks like older versions. This one has the cord totally external.	1
bought this to replace a 10 yr old bagless upright. my wife told me vacuum died, great just replaced washer, belt and guides on dryer, and paid step daughters rent. ughhh. my wife keeps a "sterile" house, with 2 cats whos mission in life is eat,poop,shed. the bagless we had was designed to be used especialy with animal hair, cutting edge technology. never again. never again. never again. ty this vacuum was what I needed. first bags, I know buy a vacuum with out bags and you will save in long run, uh no. most of the bagless are more money, plus the capacity of that silly little cup oh that silly cup. the cup filled up with cat hair in six seconds, then dust piled on top or inter mixed so when you opened the cup,like a jack in the box poof hair dust all over.vacum again to get that crap up, wipe machine wash up hands and face. sorry twice as much work, and time is money. lets talk suction okay I understand the other vacuum was 10 yrs old but this little guy, when I tried to vacuum a chair bam sucked the chair in. just before the other died I tried to vacuum lint out off my drier, had to pick it up with my hand and stick down hose. okay understand 10 yr vs brand new, yeah it was time price  at about fifty dollars its a great deal I had it shipped to my house, my wife un packed it , she said there was no instructions or the usual warranty card, I figure she missed it, but she got it running in a minute without any help so for ease of use / setup 10+ I ordered the vacuum the way I do most things, vacuum and xtra bags all came same day from amazon.i always check things like refills or bags are also available. they were reasonable. noise not bad its a vacuum on a scale of 1-10 for vacuums its a 5 its what you would expect from a regular vacuum. one point to mention,  the suction must be adjustable,my wife told me when she adjusted it , the vacum made a annoying whistle noise so she returned it to its original setting all in all, fast ship and cheap ship, free thanks amazon prime , with a great value on the vacuum , and great performance thanks Bissell, a really good purchase	1
This is a cheap piece of junk, which isn't really a big surprise given it's price.  It worked OK for a few weeks, but got louder and louder, it puffs out dust, both when you start it and then while using it.  Yes, the filters are clean and in place.  The machine gets quite dirty on the outside as the plastic seems to become statically charged and attract dust.  You MUST clean the sponge filter EVERY time you use the machine.  I replaced the machine once under warranty, but now I just give up.  I can't see that poor design and cheap, shoddy construction can be overcome.  I'm willing to spend more for a better tool.  Once again I have found that the most expensive tool is a cheap one that doesn't do its job.	-1
Really great vacuum here. Really gets the dirt and pet hair off the carpet. The hand attachments are great for cleaning the furniture.  Id like to edit my previous comment on this vacuum. I posted my previous comment right after I purchased it. Granted this vacuum performed excellent when it was new, but not even a year has passed by and it is completely destroyed. I use the vacuum once a week at best so I got less than 50 uses out of it before it was ruined by a terrible design flaw. The problem I have is with the belt slipping. Once the belt starts to slip it will begin to create a ton of heat in the housing. Over time the housing which keeps the belt stable and in place began to thin and melt away. It eventually just couldn't hold the belt in place anymore. Then it would get caught up in the housing and make the vacuum smoke until I turned the power off. The amount of time this vacuum lasted for me is completely unacceptable. I used it normally and it replaced a vacuum that was over 7 years old under the same conditions. Now I am without a vacuum, out ninety dollars and no contact from the seller.  Do not buy this vacuum, look elsewhere.	-1
bad bulky design, eats carpet	-1
wait over 60 days never see the vacuum	-1
So, I admit this sucks up lots of dust in the carpet. I went over it when it was 'cleaned' by my shark vacuum and got up so much more. However, I accidentally sucked up a sock that was under the edge of the couch (I didn't see it and it wasn't a problem with the Shark) and it broke part of the sole plate on the vacuum. Its possible that was broken when I bought it since i bought a Amazon warehouse deal. I admit I didn't look at the bottom of the vacuum before I tried it and the sock was sucked up within a few minutes of vacuuming. So, the vacuum sounds insane now and its super loud and crazy. I really regret buying this. My shark vacuum has lasted almost 2 years now and I have even sucked up more than one sock that went all the way into the dirt canister and I saved later.  I wanted a second vacuum so I could have one on each floor in my home and this was a best seller and half the price of another shark. Worst decision ever. A replacement part is $11, but shipping for that part is like $8 and will take maybe 2 weeks. All for 10 minutes of vacuuming? If this keeps up it will cost the same as the double the price vacuum in the matter of a couple of months. Terrible, terrible product. The worst is that I can't tell if it was literally from sucking up one sock in the vacuum or if it was damaged and getting the sock in there knocked the broke part loose.	-1
This vacuum (for the unit I received, anyway) should never have left the test table at Bissell.  When it is started, the belt is misaligned so badly between the motor that drives it and the beater bar that the belt shreds, as it pushed its way to the end of the beater bar.  After about 10 minutes of use, the plastic floor guard that internally houses the belt guides inside, breaks where the belt relentless pushes on it, while shredding itself to death.  This vacuum cleaner that I received is an epic fail by Bissell's design and/or manufacturing dept, and a certain fail by the apparently non-existent testing process that should be occurring wherever these units are made.  Bissell rep, please explain to me how such a poor unit can be sold to the public, if you are good enough to respond to my review here, thanks.	-1
they fall apart.	-1
Not what was expected, I received a bottle filled with "BLACK GOO" I'm not sure if I received the wrong oil or what, but I can tell you its not good for windup clocks  putting a drop on my finger and rubbing it it feels like a gritty penetration oil	-1
Disappointed.  Returning.  Nothing more to say.	-1
I've used this 4 times so far, and my clock still squeaks.  The squeaking stops only for a matter of hours after application, then starts right back up again.  Life on this oil is way to short.	-1
This vacuum seemed really great, and I originally reviewed it at a full 5 stars. Many people seem to be reviewing the same way as well, quickly. I am sad to say, this vacuum actually started 'kerplunking' after a couple months, and rapidly declined to an unusable state. We ended up coughing and sneezing every time that we vacuumed. Eventually, people started saying that our house smelled "dusty." It was because of the vacuum.  My original review title: Sometimes you get MORE than what you pay for!! SO sad. You actually do not get more than what you pay for with this item. Now, I realize, you should just pay a little more and get a quality vacuum.  We ended up spending about $200 for the Shark Lift Away, and it was AMAZINGLY high quality. After the first vacuuming, my mother-in-law came over, and instantly, the very first thing she said before she put her bag down was, "You got your carpets steam cleaned?!" My partner and I looked at each other and laughed. We told her we had just vacuumed with a different vacuum! No steam cleaners or shampooers at all. Just a one-time use of a Shark vacuum! I am not kidding you. The Shark Lift Away is incredible! It is worth it to skip this one and get a Shark!! --Or at least a higher quality vacuum in general. ...Good luck, friends! :-)	-1
After TWO promised and missed ship and delivery dates by uxcell it only worked for one week!!!	-1
Wrap would not stick together.  I followed the instructions, wrapped the product around a pipe, but the wrap did not adhere to the pipe or to itself.  Im a bit suspicious that some moisture may have seeped into the packaging while it was stored on the shelf prior to shipment.  The wrap was extremely hard to unroll.  When I applied water the wrap was hard and did not feel tacky.  Anyway, the product didn't work.	-1
Waste of money and time to attempt a repair.  Maybe it was a defective batch or old (box had not "best buy date".  Followed instructions for a repair and it would not even stick to itself to be able to wrap.  I have written the manufacture and am still waiting for a response..	-1
I bought this just to test it. Not pack it away and hope for the best when I really needed it. I setup an extreme test by joining two 1" diameter wood dowels then allowed the 15 minutes as recommended. 78 degF Very disappointed in how easy it was to break.  I would expect this might be OK for a split handle of some sort but for that a much smaller and cheaper 5 minute epoxy kit would be better to have around.	-1
junk	-1
This did not work for me at all.  I was attempting to fix a cracked piece of PVC irrigation line.  I followed the directions exactly.  However, it did not hold up.  The water leaked right through.  Maybe it will work for something that doesn't require it to be water tight, but it sure enough did not work for me.	-1
Purchased this to seal a copper pipe water leak, very small leak, about 1/4 cup per day. Anyway, turned off water, removed pressure. sanded surface with wire wheel and sand paper, clean area to be sealed with alcohol then let dry. Followed procedure to soak FiberFix, then wrapped tightly with many layers over a 4: area with the one inch tape. Covered FiberFix with plastic strip and let dry for about 15 minutes, removed plastic wrap then let FiberFix dry for another six hours. Everything seemed fine, FiberFix had hardened well. Now I turn the water back on and slowly but surely the water started coming through the FiberFix, now I have multiple drips along the 4 inch area where I applied FiberFix. Remember I only had a very slow drip, a drop every couple minutes from a copper pipe to T joint. Now I will have to cut out the T and pipe and do a real copper pipe replacement.  The product did not work as advertised for repairing leaking pipe.	-1
I suppose some people have found this tape to be a real problem solver. For me, I found it to be a sticky mess, of tape, and too pricey. Hey, another thing no reviewer who raved about this mentioned that once the sealed packaged is opened, and this roll is soaked in water, you better have use for all of it as any left not usable in the future.	-1
I saw this on Shark Tank and figured if the sharks invested, it had to be legit? Well I followed the steps ( There are 3 different sets instructions, one on the box, one on the bag and on on the paper insert ) It says it is 100 times stronger than duct tape on the box. Well it might be 100 times stronger than rice paper, that is about it. Funny as the example it shows is repairing a shovel handle and that is exactly what I was repairing. Here is the kicker. It shows you can piece two broken pieces together and it is stronger than steel. Well mine was just cracked and needed support. After 24 hours I tested it and it still wobbles just like the tape was not on it. For me, major fail. For the money, I won't try it again	-1
Very lightly rolled. Looks like a lot of wrapping, but doesn't last long.	-1
Description is wrong, this isn't made in the USA, it's made in china. None of the accuracy specifications are correct either.  Amazon needs to properly catalog these items.	-1
Jacks are usable BUT the base is not square with the bolt AT ALL. It's visible to the eye when you're screwing it in and out. I guess you get what you paid for. I'm going to turn and thread my own base. The craftsmanship of this product is as my shop teacher used to say, "crapsmanship". I thought to expect more from a Fowler brand, was I wrong?	-1
The first roll I received that was fulfilled by Amazon was mislabeled or the wrong color.  This black "PLA" filament does not extrude at the same temperature as ALL my other PLA, acquired from a variety of sources.  I normally get good, clean lines at 230 C, but with this, I have to go down to below 215 C, or else it completely oozes out during printing, producing really muddy lines.  If you do happen to buy it, make sure to tweak the temperature settings until it works best for your printer.	-1
These come sealed in a foil pouch, with one side you can see through.  The pouch was unopened, and a sticker saying it was Silver PLA was on the side, but the appearance was WHITE or NATURAL.  NO SILVER to be found!  I'm not going to purchase this again in hopes that the one I received was mis-labeled, and I hope you don't waste your time either!	-1
This PLA was extremely brittle and constantly broke, leaving the print unfinished, and forcing me to restart the print over and over again.	-1
At first this filament (black) printed nicely, no tangles, etc.  But as the spool wore down, the filament became more brittle and began breaking constantly.  It's likely the entire spool was brittle, but the outer winds were less stressed.  Either way, I've had to abandon the spool about 1/2 used because it's too brittle to feed into the printer at this point.	-1
How did I do that, you ask? How did I print this invisible model? That's right! All I had to do was buy this PLA Filament from Zen Toolworks! Just like that, you too can print air EVERY TIME!!!	-1
Extremely brittle. Keeps breaking between the spool and my extruder, ruining prints.	-1
I received this on 12/24. Very easy to assemble. Adjusted the suction so the vacuum would be easy to move on the carpeting. I vacuumed the bedroom and then switched to the wood floors. While I was vacuuming, it gave off the strong odor of "heat". I never  was subjected to this with either my  Dyson or my Electrolux Nimble. I purchased this so my wife would have a lighter vacuum to use. I shut off the vacuum and found that the shroud covering the motor section was so hot that I couldn't even touch it with my bare hand. I then went to unplug it and found that the AC cord was exceedingly warm to the touch. All this was first use right out of the box. In my opinion this condition is either poor manufacturing or poor engineering. I have seen other reviews complaining of the vacuum overheating and shutting down. Nowhere does Hoover address these complaints, other than to say, " check the filters and empty the container and check the roller".  With me, this was straight out of the box. Needless to say it is being returned forthwith. One thing I don't need is a possible fire or worse. I'll look for something else.	-1
Often turns on by itself causing batteries to drain. Also when you click it on, the internals seems loose and the light flickers. Adjusting the spring on the battery helped a bit but it's back to turning on when IT wants to.	-1
Cheap lights but only about half of them work right. The others flicker constantly when they are on.	-1
Broke on the first hole I tried to drill with it. Returned to Amazon for a full credit. Amazon is the best as far as returns	-1
With my eyesight this thing is useless.  With my old eyes and progressive lenses there is no way to get the scale in focus.  This is simple and seems well made, and I expect kids with good eyesight can see what they need to see for science class.	-1
Not what I expected. I can do better with small needle nose pliers.	-1
Am a tried using this DSO v3 device after installing a pair of Alpine amps (F300 & M500) hooked to a Pioneer AVH head unit. The device UI is horrendous (& I am a tech savvy person) & it doesn't help that the owner's manual that comes w/ was written by a someone that clearly doesn't know how to explain a lot of info to a newbie.  I ended up watching a YouT video of some1 using the device to tune their amp. After figuring it out, the distortion levels for my head unit & amps that it gave me turned out to be in correct. Moreover, the waves where extremely hard to read.  Luckily I also got the SMD DD-1 distortion detecting device & which was MUCH easier to use for an everyday joe like me. My car's audio now sounds awesome w/ the amp gains tuned properly.  If u are a DIY person looking to saves bucks trying to tune your car audio, I DON'T recommend this crap. I now see that the DD-1 is a great value (though $150 is hard to swallow) when compared to the other thousand dollar oscilloscopes on the market.	-1
I know it says "Nano" right there in the product name, but holy JEEBUS this thing is TINY! It's actually just 3.5" x 2.5" x 0.5" (the dimensions listed in the details are for the product packaging). This thing could get lost in the palm of my hand!  Having said that, it works much better than I expected. I'm using this to tune car audio systems, and it functions flawlessly for that purpose. I did have to get a separate 10x probe (along with a 3.5mm-BNC adapter) to read amplifier output, but those things are dirt cheap and readily available.  The display on this unit is very bright and easily readable, which is especially surprising considering its size. It does lose readability when viewing from an angle, but considering the price, that's forgivable.  Max probed voltage resolution is only 10v, which is why I needed a 10x probe. While most of my audio readings are within the 10v range, measuring amplifier output requires readings as high as 30v in some cases. So the 10x probe allows me to read speaker outputs properly.  I did upgrade to the BenF 3.64 firmware, which removes a couple of annoyances and simplifies the interface nicely. However I found out the hard way that the latest version of these devices requires a special patched version of the BenF firmware. The one linked to in the product Wiki will actually bork your device because it doesn't support the newer display. Search the Seeed Studios forums for the right patched firmware.  Overall I'm happy with this purchase. A little surprised at its size, and I wish it would display voltages beyond 10v, but beyond that it's a very handy tool at a fantastic price. Well done.  UPDATE 06/06/14 =============== I've downgraded my rating from 4 stars to 2. While measuring a circuit using the DSO Nano V3, I noticed that it was telling me a lower-than-expected vrms value. So I checked with my Fluke 88v meter, and sure enough the voltage reading from the DSO Nano V3 was too low (1.95v vs 1.82v). It also kept dropping very slowly.  The battery indicator on the DSO Nano V3 showed 3/4 full, but just out of curiosity, I plugged in the USB cable to charge it. Immediately, the vrms reading jumped up to 1.94v, which almost matched my Fluke 88v.  Mind you, I wasn't reading the DSO Nano's own output signal, this was a completely separate circuit. There's no reason why the voltage it's READING should be affected by its own internal power supply, that's a pretty lame defect.  So in my opinion, this scope isn't terribly useful for precision work. Its only use for me is in checking frequency waves for clipping. For everything else, I consider it useless.	-1
Nice bottle but the nozzle neck cracks and breaks.  I purchased six and three of them have broken in the same place.  Appears the machining of the threaded part needs to be reengineered.  Would NOT recommend until then.	-1
The spray tube is too short to reach the bottom so you'll never be able to spray the last 10% of your product. Buy cheap spray bottles at Home Depot or WalMart - they're less expensive, better quality, and last longer. Chemical Guys has become an over inflated brand name used to peddle cheap junk. If you do get stuck with this bottle, you can order 6mm OD x 4mm ID Polyethylene flexible tubing, and you can cut a correct dip tube length.	-1
Another piece of overpriced junk from Chemical Guys - They're slapping their brand on anything and this is a prime example. The sprayer falls apart quickly and the spray tube is about an inch too short to reach the bottom of the bottle. This leaves a few ounces of product that you can't utilize.  They've been told of this defect and they stated that their bottles worked "perfectly fine".  That shows you the low level that their products and customer service have reached. If you do get stuck with this bottle, you can order 6mm OD x 4mm ID Polyethylene flexible tubing, and you can cut a correct dip tube length.	-1
Would rate higher if it wasn't for the white powered residue it leaves behind	-1
The fit and finish on these are POOR; there are lots of dings on the threads, one end is counter bored but the other is not.  The machined threads are not symmetrical, which makes it seem like the CNC program for this item needs to be refined quite a bit.  Most companies finish their products by tumbling them in media, but these appear to be fresh from machining.	-1
Firstly, if you have these and they work for you: Great. However, in my case, they don't work at all, other than individually, in which case there are a thousand possibilities. Here is what I found with the set I received this Nov 2015: No two threaded ports will match up with any other two tapped holes on the other block. They "almost" mate, but there is no way the two I received are "matched". I'm going to spend more money and hopefully get a working pair. Oh, and other thing that really irks me: Why are the untapped ports to small to pass a 3/8" fastener through? This is one of the better examples of "You get what you pay for".	-1
Shipping from Amazon prime was perfect ! Product is not even worth buying. 3/8"-16 holes sloppy. Thru holes are not large enough for clearance of a 3/8" bolt !  How can you bolt them together? When put together holes don't even line up even if you could put a thru bolt in. I even emailed Anytime Co. before my purchase and there was no reply. Will I keep them? Yes, only to use as a line up block because of the inexpensive price. I will research and pay the price for blocks that do not have these defects for the higher precision needed for other operations and set up. Hope this helps some of the viewers looking for this product. Bottom Line- You Get What You Pay For.	-1

Cheap imitation of a previously well made product.  The old Bucket Dolly had tough, durable plastic construction with threaded metal inserts and metal screws, and tough durable shop wheels.  Chemical Guys has used inferior plastic, and cheaper components to sell a cheap copy of a former product, counting on the reputation of the previous product. if they're going to reduce the quality of this item so much, then they should cut the selling price by half as well. "Build it cheap, Sell it cheap" should be their new company motto.	-1

These are a bad deal.  Mine arrived with balls of what appear to be welding spall and spatter stuck on them, plus two of them were a bit rusty.  Not something you'd be proud to use, or show a customer.  When stewmac has stainless gauges, way nicer and thinner where it counts, for just a couple bucks more, why buy these junky non-stainless ones?  I'd have to spend time with a grinder and a file to make these just okay, and that's not even okay.  These would be acceptable at five bucks, but not at twenty plus five shipping.  Come on.  Somebody is trying to sell these for more than they are worth.  Make your own or buy good ones, but don't buy these if you have another option, which you do if you're online...	-1
This is by far one of the most popular controllers out there.  I used this with a rice cooker to make my own black garlic.  This needs a precise temperature for about three weeks to get the garlic to ferment to a black and slightly vinegary taste.  This controller only lasted me for two sessions and now its a hunk of junk.	-1

I have purchased two of similar units of this type, and both times I was thoroughly unimpressed. With MANY heating units it simply doesn't work. I have contacted them and they were unable to help.	-1
Very disappointed in the sewn in tag that damages the seam edge when removed.  If you rip it out, you tear open the seam which gets worse with each washing.  If you carefully cut right at the edge of the seam, you still leave a portion of the tag along the seam which can scratch your car finish.  You'd think that Chemical Guys would know better than to sew a potentially scratch producing nylon tag into something made for rubbing on auto finishes. I won't buy any more until they find a better solution to the tag problem	-1
I can get past the lack of any useful documentation/instructions, pain getting the software and drivers to work in x64 Win7 or Win8 but the unstable software and hardware were too much.  The scope software would intermittently drop out the USB connection/communication to the scope hardware module regularly on ~3 min intervals after about 10 mins of operation.  I tested on two separate computers one with Win8 and one with Win7 with same behaviors.  It only seemed to work fine for measuring low voltage square waves.  The main reason I wanted this unit was for secondary ignition waveforms and it did not work at all for this usage scenario.  Upon connecting the supplied BNC HT ignition probe to any secondary ignition cable, the software would not display a waveform, it would and say it was searching for a signal and sometime it would even crash the computer OS.  My guess is a driver issue - I did however download whatever I could glean as being the latest drivers from Hantek's web site and also checked their support bulletin boards.  Very disappointing overall experience as I wasted a good bit of time trying to get it working.  The only upside is Amazon stood behind the product and processed a return for me.  I understand that one can't expect much for something priced this low but I'd expect it to at least work for the most basic functions its advertised as supporting.  The only thing I didn't try is setting up an XP SP3 OS build to test on.	-1
700 psi?  Repair leaks under pressure?  I used an entire roll trying to seal a pinhole leak on a 4 inch pipe.  This was at only 60 psi.  I would wrap the tape and it would bubble up and leak out the side.  I tried wrapping it super tight, tried wrapping it not so tight.  It just didn't work at all.  Very disappointing.  Not a chance it could handle 700 psi.  I couldn't get it to seal a pinhole leak at just 60 psi with the whole roll!  I thought this would be a perfect temporary fix.  Now I can't imagine what this would be good for?  Maybe seal a leak on a pipe with no pressure at all?	-1
I've tried for years to find the rubber tape I used in the US Navy for weatherproofing outdoor connections.  This is not it.  This is not the triangular shape and it is very, very, thin.  I would really like to identify the manufacturer and part for what we used in the Navy.  All the stuff I see online is not the same; it all appears to be cheap imitations but not the original.	-1

I don't know how many "stick vacs" are out there but I do know this:  This stick vac does not measure up to any of the ones I've owned.  It hardly picks anything up, it's not effective on rugs or carpets.  The only plus side is it has a removable portable hand held vac.  But that doesn't work so well either.  Runs on a non-lithium battery which means more charging and less vacuum time.  If you really want a high quality stick vac that will last a long time, function flawlessly, and run for 35-40 minutes between charges and is easy to clean, consider the Rowanta&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Rowenta-Delta-Force-18V-Cordless-Bagless-Energy-Star-Rated-Stick-Vacuum-Cleaner-with-40-Minute-Runtime-and-Floor-and-Carpet-Functions/dp/B005M79ZES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Rowenta Delta Force 18V Cordless Bagless Energy Star Rated Stick Vacuum Cleaner with 40 Minute Runtime and Floor and Carpet Functions</a>&nbsp;I've had the Rowanta for two years and it runs like new.  If you purchase this Eureka Rapidclean you will just wind up buying another one very soon.  You won't be happy with this one.  You should consider paying more and getting something you'll use for many years to come.	-1
I really wanted to like this product.  Our house is mostly carpeted, except for the kitchen, bathrooms, and hardwood in the hall/entryway.  It can be a pain to drag out the regular vacuum to do a quick cleanup, so I thought a stick vacuum would work well.  On the plus side, this unit was easy to put together.  On the down side, it barely works!  It can pick up bigger things, like a piece of dropped food, but nothing else. Little pieces of dirt, grass, etc. just get blown around.  Plus charging it takes forever and it loses power VERY quickly.  The handheld vacuum attachment sounds like a good idea in theory, but it's pretty lame also.  Didn't anyone test this before putting it on the market?  Honestly, I don't recommend it.	-1
I'll just say right off the bat that this stickvac is not worth the price.  The 2 main complaints are that it loses the charge much too quickly and it doesn't pick up well. Both of these are obviously very important (missing) features. You need the vac to stay charged long enough to use it and you need it to actually pick stuff up.  This one seems to be very picky about what it wants to pick up and when. There is no sense of it because one minute it will pick up something a little bigger and won't pick up small stuff and the next time you use it, it will be the opposite.  When using it in the kitchen, it didn't want to pick up pieces of grass that had been tracked in by the door. This was not huge clumps of grass, not wet grass, not stuck to the floor grass... just single little pieces of grass scattered on the floor, maybe an inch or two long, at most. It doesn't like to pick up pet hair off of hard floors either. After running the vac, you can still sweep up plenty hair/dust/dirt with the broom.  Some cookie crumbs left by the kids were gone over several times and it still didn't want to pick everything up. Cat litter is iffy - sometimes it will pick it up, sometimes not, and regardless it will always spit some back out at you. No matter what you're vacuuming, it always seems to want to spit some back out at your feet.  The dust cup is small, so even if it does pick up, it can't pick up much at a time.  As a hand vac, it isn't much better at all. The opening at the end is pretty large and circular and it just doesn't do a very good job.  On the brightside, it is very easy to put together. You just attach the handle with a screw. I did it with a butter knife in about 15 seconds. It is fairly slim and easy to store. The swivel head is nice to maneuver the vac around. But, all of these good things do not matter at all if the vac simply does not do what it is supposed to.  For this price, I really expect something much better. The least it could do is work.  I cannot recommend this stickvac. Sad to say, the even more expensive model 240A isn't much better either. I'd scratch both of these off the comparison list and look to other brands.	-1
The Eureka Rapid Clean was fairly easy to put together. The product feels extremely lightweight in a kind of cheap way. The vacuum portion (which clicks off to a handheld) seems to be something like a Dirt Buster. The vacuum comes with a slight charge but I wanted to test it fully charged. I was surprised at the charge time required - around 17 hours but thought that perhaps it had to do with a much longer lasting use period. Unfortunately, this was not the case. It certainly took the 17 hours to charge but the suction degraded at around ten minutes. It was fairly useless after twenty minutes and dead after twenty-five. It will take another 17 hours to re-charge. Frankly, this is unacceptable charge versus use time. I couldn't vacuum my ground floor in twenty minutes let alone both stories of my house.  The vacuum advertises itself for bare and carpeted floors. It has a beater brush but has no way to stop the brush from rotating. Because of that, I would never suggest using it on hardwood. It would beat the wood and perhaps scratch it or worse. My other vacuums all have a switch to stop the rotating of the brush. The RapidClean did an okay job of picking up dust and so worth from a low pile carpet as long as I was pushing it with the grain of the carpet. The moment I tried to switch directions, it became difficult to push and buckled the head up. I had to walk around to find the direction I needed to push or it would not work properly.  I tried to vacuum my tile floors but found that it was not picking up things at all - probably due to the degraded suction as time went on. I have short hair cats and it was unable to pick up their hair or their litter very well. The receptacle filled very quickly due to its small size. When I went to empty it, what litter had been picked up fell back through the stick onto my hardwood floor. It wasn't being held in the receptacle but was somehow in the stick. I had to get out another vacuum to clean up the mess that the Eureka made.  I have recently used a Rowenta RH8548U1 Delta Force 18V Cordless Bagless which I really like. It is twice as expensive but works well on carpets, tile, and wood floors. It has a 40 minutes battery life and takes much less time to re-charge. If it is in your budget, that is the cordless that I would recommend.  I don't recommend the Eureka RapidClean 2-1. It has a short battery life, long re-charge cycle, not really useable for hardwood floors, questionable suction, and extremely low capacity dust cup (it really is about a cup!) There are better and cheaper corded vacuums and for a bit more money, there are much better cordless ones.	-1
I'm baffled by the positive reviews here. I own 6 vacuums, and this is the worst one I own. I will compare this Eureka directly with the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hoover-Linx-Cordless-Stick-Vacuum-Cleaner/dp/B001PB8EJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hoover Linx Cordless Stick Vacuum Cleaner</a>, which is the other stick vacuum I use on a daily basis.  Packaging/assembly: It comes tightly packaged in a long, skinny box. Unpacking it once the box was opened was frustrating, as everything is encased in a plastic bag. It was easy enough to put together - one screw, pop in the suction unit (a glorified Dust Buster), and away you go. It's basically 2 vacuums in one - one is a Dust Buster, and the other is a stick vacuum with the Dust Buster built in.  Build: 100% plastic. Not a single thing feels high quality on this vacuum. Unfortunately most vacuums are pure plastic these days, but I've never seen one with more plastic than this one.  Performance: Yikes - bad, bad, bad. We have bamboo flooring all throughout our house with area rugs. We also have 3 dogs and a cat. This vacuum pales in comparison to the Hoover Linx. You should disregard any of the reviews that state this vacuum picks up hair off of rugs - it does NOT work on rugs. I literally cannot get this vacuum to pick up anything on a rug. It has a roller brush, which does a great job of pushing hair all over the rug but not actually picking it up. The Hoover excels in this category, hands down.  As far as picking up hair on the hardwood, it does a fine job with hairballs floating on the floor. With dust, grass, cat litter...well, that's a different story. It literally picked up 25% of that stuff I tried to pick up. It has very poor suction, likely because this is a glorified dust buster, as previously mentioned.  The head on this vacuum maneuvers in a very awkward manner. It's got rubber wheels on the bottom that are quite loud on hardwood (much louder than the Hoover), and it's difficult to turn the head on a dime like the Hoover.  You can get underneath tables easily, as the head folds down nicely. The head does not lock in place when you stand this vacuum up, however. So you have to stand it up and hope it doesn't fall over on its own. Plus, when you carry this anywhere, the head just flops down because it can't lock in place. Poor design.  The Dust Buster part is the dirt receptacle. It doesn't hold much, and is kind of a pain to empty (you have to take out the filter, dump upside down, the fit it all back together). With the Hoover, you press a button and all the contents fall out and you close the lid (plus the container is about 3 times bigger).  The battery takes 16-17 hours to charge (per the instructions), and lasted for about 2 runs through my first floor. It loses some battery power about 5 minutes after a full charge. You charge the dust buster part, either attached to the vacuum or all by itself.  The dust buster by itself is handy for crumbs and spills on furniture. It does not pick up any hair whatsoever, so don't even try. It's exactly like dust busters used to be in the 80s.  Overall, this is a glorified dust buster that is trying to vacuum your floors. It simply cannot compete with more powerful stick vacuums, like the Hoover Linx. This Eureka would work well if you worked in a feather factory and that's all you had to pick up. Otherwise, you're better off looking elsewhere.  Right now on Amazon, for $40 more you can get the Hoover Linx, which works exponentially better than this Eureka. It's made of much higher quality material and actually picks up hair (both on hardwood and on rugs). I simply cannot recommend this vacuum in good conscience - there are far better options.  Pros: detachable dust buster can be useful spinning brush on the bottom can help to pick up balls of hair  Cons: 100% plastic poor suction - does not pick up litter and dust very well, and does not have strong suction compared to other vacuums in the same class does NOT work on rugs/carpet - it just spreads hair around poor maneuverability - very awkward and LOUD head does not lock in an upright position and flops all over the place while carrying it cumbersome to empty the dust receptacle, and it doesn't hold much	-1

I purchased two of these meters. Each arrived with its own 50amp shunt. I connected the first meter according to the wiring diagram using a 24volt DC power supply and a calibrated 50amp electronic load. I tested the first meter and shunt and found that the meter displayed the voltage correctly but  an ampere reading that was  a little more than 3 times the load. I selected various loads between 1 amp and 25 amp, the meter ramped up and down as I changed the load but always displayed approximately three times the actual current. I used a separate calibrated ammeter and it showed the correct amperage while the DROK meter showed three times the value. I replaced the first meter and shunt with the second meter and shunt and had exactly the same response. I tried two different power supplies, one rated 12v DC and the other 24V DC. Both of the DROK meters displayed the correct voltage but both consistently showed three times the actual current flow.  I also checked and found that each meter was correctly labeled for 50 amperes, and both shunts were marked as 50 ampere, 75mv shunts.  I used a calibrated millivolt meter to confirm the actual voltage drop across both shunts (I only connected one shunt at a time to the load) and determined that the shunts were providing the correct voltage drop for the current flow.  I can only assume that there is a problem inside each meter, possibly they are incorrectly labeled.  So, unless someone out there has another suggestion, I am in the process of returning the units. Too bad, I really like the displays.	-1
Iam not sure if i am using this thing correctly, but the product seems to be a waste of money, i tried many ways of getting it to tell me the Voltage and Amps, but it only shows me one of the other	-1
I've ordered three of these, they come with no documentation at all and they do not match the item pictured -- the wires are different colors and the circuit boards don't match at all.  I've burned up two already, one by following the directions posted in one of the pictures, one by trying to figure it out based on internet searching.  Basically, if you don't know exactly how these work and what each wire is supposed to mean without documentation and/or years of experience, expect to pay at least $30 or more.  I personally think it is a scam by these companies to sell extra devices.	-1
I ordered this along with two packs of replacement pads. I used this on ceramic tiled floors 6 times only, each time for less than 15 minutes. Now, the wheels turn, then stop....turn, then stop. It is fully charged. I removed all hairs that wrapped around the wheels after using every time. Extremely disappointed.	-1
Worked until I cleaned it per the manual instructions. Very disappointed. Took the wheel assembly out per the manual instructions and removed the wheels exactly as described in the manual to get to the wound up hair. Reassembled and wheels will not turn. I bought another as a gift and was about to buy a third as a gift but this has changed those plans, Needs a better design to prevent hair from getting trapped in the  wheel assembly so it doesn't have to be taken apart to be cleaned. Not worth my twentyfive bucks. Sad. I had even named it Rosie O'Grady..	-1

Sorry ... really don't like leaving unpleasant reviews.  But first all: Seller is honorable, responsive, and made good on refund of pump. In summary: Quite dissatisfied with pump.  Ad did not have sufficient information such as inlet / outlet size.  Turns out these are 1/2" and need to be adapted to various pipe thread sizes. Had to go to RV store to find adapters with cone inserts to seal from leaking. Threads on pump are plastic ... not stainless as description partially indicates under material.  Worst part is diaphragm pump internal check valve did not initially function properly and caused excessive pulsing and pipe vibrations that triggered sever pressure gauge needle gyrations. Blurred so bad with pump action that could not read.  After starting and stopping pump several times, it settled down some but rattles the pipe with pulsing. Subsequent to trying to determine what in the world was going on ... learned that there are noise cancelling hoses that can be used and perhaps an accumulator installed to mitigate pulsing. (Thus manufacturer is aware of issues). Cost of these added items doubles pump project costs.  Plus internal 'check valve' fail would require an external one. Pump did make pressure to about 45 psi, however, the automatic shut - off was not a clean shut - off. Motor slowed down and made sputtering sound prior to finally turning off.  (Perhaps switch arcing inside, I don't know, but didn't sound right.)  Overall,  due to above deficiencies, questionable reliability, and poor product information, pump was returned for refund ... which I received.	-1
This pump turned out to be noisy, and id didn't work right.  I called Shurflo, they said it wasn't really the best fit for an RV, and they offered to send me a replacement membrane kit, that they said would make it work better.  I just sent the pump back and bought the "Shurflo 4008-101-E65" right here on amazon.  It is much, much better for RV use.	-1
I was not happy with this vacuum. I have purchased shark vacuum cleaners before and was very satisfied.  This is my first cordless, I wasted my money on this one. Very very poor performance, left a lot of debris on floor. Almost no suction after days of charging unit. I should have ask for a refund.	-1
The roller shuts off if I use it on carpet.	-1
I have a corded Shark vac that is great so I thought this would be too.  I am having a problem with the nozzle coming up from the floor as I vacuum.  Yes, I put my foot on it and pull back on the handle and all is fine for a short while and then the nozzle rises up just enough to be ineffective at vacuuming.  I also have a problem getting it to pick up cat litter on bare floors no matter which speed I use.  Update 5/25/17:  I contacted the seller and they sent another nozzle, but missing the battery.  Then they sent the battery.  After installing the battery it would not charge.  I appreciate the seller's efforts, but this vacuum is just a piece of junk and I wasted my money.  I just bought a cordless vac at Costco for a lot less money.  At least it will be easy to return if I run into problems.	-1
Hardly any suction. Would not pick up kitty litter on bare floor or short nappy carpet. I returned it.	-1
To complete various projects involving small motors and high output LED modules, I purchased five PWM controllers, including two of this specific module.  There was no documentation, so I was a little bewildered why neither of the two controllers worked at first with any type of load.  It was only until I pried the cover off that the presence of a three-way polarity switch was obvious.  That is normal-off-reverse.  Both switches were set to off?!?!  It is hard to imagine the logic of this design.  The switch isn't easily accessible or even visible with the cover still attached.  The perforations allow for manipulation of this internal switch but considering the potential damage to expensive equipment, it should be more visible with its status obvious.  Having purchased different products from DROK previously, I am growing tired of the lack of documentation. Even the simplest of products has important parameters and feature that an electronics designer should know.	-1
I guess its strong enough, strength wise, but don't use it in a hot climate. It won't stay on. So hurricane tape is just a name, you can't actually use it where hurricanes are.	-1
I guess I should not have expected much for this price.  No problems with assembly, mostly just a lot of switches.  But the signal quality is poor.  While the frequency response is good, the amount of distortion and noise is terrible.  See the three attached photos of a 250 Hz sine wave.  The first shows the overall noise level and the second and third ones show the nature of the noise which seems to be not random at all.  Unless you are just wanting to play around, I would not suggest spending your money on this.  Go to Ebay and buy a older used but tested function generator and have something you can really use.	-1
did not work, this is a piece of garbage. Very disappointed as I started assembling this kit, when finish the lights turn on but no signal, not data on LCD.	-1

I was really excited about getting this as I have other superior Dyson products. Unfortunately I'm not very happy with the Dyson DC47 Animal Compact Canister vacuum. After a minute my arm was tired from pushing and pulling the front aparatus and canister. The front doesn't glide smoothely at all. Also the the floor attachment bounces off the carpet as it is vacuuming so you have to make multiple swipes over an area to pick up the debris and hair. The debris canister is so small you might as well forget getting anything done in a hurry as you will spend all your time repeatedly emptying the canister; which is dumb for an animal vacuum which is supposed to pick up lots of PET HAIR. And don't expect to make it very far as the cord is SHORT! If you want to use this on a normal staircase be prepared to plug it in once at the top, STOP in the middle, and then plug it in at the botton and then finish working your way down the steps because there is not enough power cord to do it all in one trip. I don't recommend this at all.	-1
This Dyson DC50 Compact is a major disappointment to me after owning and using the DC14 since 2006.  I know it's a Compact model, but it just looks and feels cheap to me and it's difficult to keep in the upright position and a pain to use the hose - no, I don't like it at all.  Well, one positive thing, it does have great suction, but it's still not the quality of the DC14 which I loved and after having some repair work done to it, it never worked as well so I replaced it with this DC50 - I needed the lightweight, but this thing is more trouble than convenient.  Now, this is just my opinion. If i could still return it I would............  I'll do some budgeting in the next months and get a larger Dyson because it still is my favorite vacuum, just not this DC50.  It's like a toy with a lot of attachments that are a pain to deal with...........With the DC14 if I saw a spider I just pulled out the extension wand and zapped it - this one requires extra steps and by then the critter is gone......  And, I do not like the 'ball' model at all - seems more difficult to keep the vacuum in an upright position because it is always wanting to fall back.	-1
update:  IT BROKE.  CAN'T FIX IT. DYSON WONT TAKE IT BACK EVEN THOUGH ITS UNDER WARRENTY. I HAVENT HAD TIME TO TAKE TO DYSON AUTHORIZED RETAILER TO FIX.  TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. DONT FALL FOR THE HYPE LIKE I DID.  Ok so I wanted to fall heads over heels in love with this vacuum but, honestly, I just didn't.  I have a Hoover windtunnel already but had an amazon gift card and saw this on sale so thought 'Gee now might be the time to get the dyson I always wanted'.  The truth is that it has some advantages to the windtunnel, some disadvantages.  The biggest disadvantage is that it gets clogged pretty easily.  Also, it doesn't pick up larger items (like popcorn or cheerios) unless you use hose attachments, but then it gets clogged.  Also it doesn't have that little hook thing to clip the cord into while you are vacuuming (a small thing I know but still, I like that hook).  Advantages are good suction and someone the design doesn't suck up the rope edges of my carpet and get all tangled.  There are three attachments that come with the vacuum and after much heming and hawing I figured out that they DO all attach - one attaches to the end of the power cord (when not in use of course) and the other two go on the sides.  (See pics).  So... at full price, I would not recommend.  If you get a bargain, sure- go for it - this is a nice vacuum but nothing amazing like I expected.  I guess next I will get a Miew  (or whatever that German brand is) and go back to bags.	-1
It really does clean well but the plastic they use feels so thin and brittle.  I think for this price, it should be built like a tank.  I will update this review if something breaks.  UPDATE DEC 2016 After owning it less than a year, and with very light use, several of the brittle plastic parts have broken or snapped off. Now if you try to pull off the canister, dust will just explode everywhere. AVOID THIS UNIT.  Dyson uses very cheap plastic. It really feels like a cheap toy. I will never buy Dyson again.  I should not have donated my Kemore which i have had for 10 years with no fail.	-1
Terrific suction but the durability is lacking.  Lasted five years, just until the warranty ran out.  For the price I paid I think it cost about $2.00 per use not counting the cost of replacing the switch four time, the brush two times and the filters one time (the lower filter fell apart after washing several times.	-1
Let me start by saying, we ownfour Dyson's at this point. The DC 50, is the weakest link in all of the vacuums we purchased in the last 10 years. It constantly gets clogged with pet hair. I believe this is the design flaw as the dirt gets caught in a small opening that goes into the container. If by chance you vacuum up a pen top or something small that is solid, it will immediately clog that opening. Also the handles extremely flimsy and twist around and gives a very insecure feeling. I would stay clear of this model.	-1
I have been an Electrolux devotee for more than 50 years and I was given this Dyson as a gift.  I like it well enough.  It is a little lighter to move about and suction is quite good.  However, there is no floor light nor does the cord retract.  I looked at the info and specs of the most expensive model of Dyson and the same is true for that model, no light, no retracting cord.  For the amount of money these vacuums cost, these features should be there.  Also there is no way to "tone down" the suction for the purpose of vacuuming drapes, blinds, etc.  All-in-all the suction of the Dyson is best but the versatility of cleaning features of my Electrolux is better, including reversing the hose and having a blower capability.  Left to my own devices, I would likely buy Electrolux again.  11/10/2014 Update: *I take away my 3 stars for this machine and would give it a zero if I could.  I have now used this machine three different times for about an hour each, emptying the canister midway and at end each time.  I did get significant dust and dirt. At 3rd emptying I stepped outside into bright sunlight and emptied it into a trash bag I had there.  In the bright sunlight all the fine particles of dust that billowed out and up as the dirt dropped out of the canister were visible.  DO NOT EMPTY THIS CANISTER INSIDE THE HOUSE!! (What fun on cold and rainy days!)  With my Electrolux this filth was all contained inside the bag and easily chucked.  *While dirt and dust are discharged from the canister easily enough, the canister itself is now filthy with coated dust on the inside and there is no easy way to clean it.  After about 45 minutes with a half roll and paper towels, an old tooth brush, my elongated ultra slim kitchen spatula and much meticulous and tedious maneuvering, I managed to clean what I could reach, but I know in the hidden, unreachable crevices, some dust still remains.  This canister should be water washable. With my Electrolux all the dirt and dust are trapped in the disposable bag.  *After such a collection of dust and dirt and the canister being so coated with dust on the inside, there was no doubt in my mind that the filters were by now quite dirty.  I removed the one from inside the canister (which was simple to do), and it looked as pristine as if it had just come off the store shelf!  I next removed the screw-on/off cap to inspect and ball filter.  That takes about 200 rotations of the cap, to the point I thought I was doing it wrong or it was broken.  Finally the ball cap released and again the filter was as clean as brand new.  I cannot understand how the machine could have taken up so much dust and dirt and yet filters appear untouched.  I am now wondering if this machine is possibly defective.  With my Eletrolux you do not have to go through all these shenanigans as all dirt is trapped inside the DISPOSABLE bag which contains a filter to prevent dust escape and the filter on the machine is readily accessible by removal on one tray.  *Now it's time to return the screw-on cover to the ball filter.  You must align the threads of the cap with that of the screw that holds the cap onto housing that covers the ball; a view of which is obliterated by the housing and cap itself, as you try to align it.  So you must raise the machine over your head with two hands so you can peak into the crevice to align the threads and with your 3rd hand hold the ball housing in place and with 4th hand turn the screw cap the 200 rotations to secure it to the housing. Needless to say, I don't as yet have this cap back in place.  *And I haven't even gotten to the point of trying the accessory tools and hose, which from other reviews I understand is somewhat difficult and unsuccessful.  THANK GOD I STILL HAVE MY OLD ELECTROLUX.  And, I think the age of my machine compared to the newness of the Dyson may well account for some of the difference in the suction power.  I would rather vacuum 2-to-1 with my old machine than to jump through all the hoops it takes to use the Dyson.  Frankly, if this vacuum had it not been a gift, it would be on its way back for a refund of the money.  Also, to add insult to injury, is the fact that the Operating/Use flyer that comes with the machine is basically diagram instructions only.  There is next to no written instructions.  There should at least be an introductory page that identifies by name and designation all the parts, buttons and filters of the machine.  Conclusion:  Beware the Dyson!	-1
I was so hopeful that this would be the vacuums of all vacuums, but after using it less than a handful of times I'm very disappointed.  Pros:  - It's small and lightweight  - uhm, it's small and lightweight... - Okay, it is fairly quiet as any "duster" vacuum would be...  Cons:  - When attempting to empty the canister the debris and "yuck" just stays stuck in it.  I shook the canister many times to get it out but the debris barely moves.  There is really no way to get a firm hold on the canister to shake it.  I ended up needing to hold the canister upside down between my knees (so the opening is facing up) and dig it out with my hands.  I'm a transplant patient who has a low immune system and I really need to be careful of germs and dust.  This was NOT fun to do!  I used to own a Shark canister and both ends opened up on the canister so that you could push the debris through if it got stuck.  Most of the debris I vacuum up is cat hair... and this is after all made for pets, but only if you have pets that barely shed... Maybe I should try to find a good lightweight bagged vacuum because not many upright bagless work well with pet hair? - The power is not as strong as I thought it would be.  It's great on hard surfaces, but poor suction on carpet.  It barely lifts the pile.  I need to go over items several times before it will pick up.  I want a vacuum to be strong enough to pick up small tufts of cat hair without the need to break my arm doing it... - You would think a vacuum of this price and reputation would have a way to attach the cord higher up so that it does not get caught up under the wheels... just sayin' - Using the hose is a nightmare!  Most vacuums with hoses are pretty easy to unhook the hose, vacuum up what you need with the hose then attach it again to continue with your job...  This hose is inside or part of the handle, and the difficult part is getting the hose back IN the handle after using it.  Then while the hose is out the vacuum is so lightweight it is not steady.  It literally feels like when you unhook the hose that the vacuum is falling apart. - It does not do good on edges.  The power just doesn't seem strong enough to pick up even a small piece of paper unless it's directly under it. - The canister is very small and needs dumped out after vacuuming 2-3 rooms. -  It is expensive for what you get.  Definitely not a powerhouse vacuum for daily use unless you have VERY little to clean up.  I'm a clean person and I don't let things get too bad, but living in a state with a lot of dust and "nature" blowing in, it is a constant battle...  I really really really wanted to like this vacuum!!!! I've heard only good things about this brand.  I have debated whether to send it back or not.  It is not easy for me to box it up and get it shipped back due to my failing health.  I may just have to keep my older Hoover Windtunnel bagged for heavy jobs (which is highly rated from ASPCA for pets) and this one for light days and dusting the ceiling fans.  But, it is kinda high priced for that.  And, I shouldn't have to keep 2 vacuums.  If the Hoover was lighter I wouldn't have even considered the Dyson actually.... I do feel badly that I cannot give higher marks for this... I truly wanted to say it's the best vacuum I've over owned...	-1
My first impressions: this is a very intuitively-designed vacuum. I didn't need to pull out the instructions to figure out how to use the hose attachment. This isn't a complaint, just an observation: for this price range, a vacuum really shouldn't be made of lightweight plastic, but rather, some kind of metal. The Dyson DC50 feels cheap in my hands, compared to my most beloved Fantom vacuum (Dyson bought the company a few years ago). My Fantom is made primarily of plastic, but it's a far heavier vacuum, and simply feels more substantial with a bit of extra weight added to it. When you spend a lot of money on something like a vacuum, it should feel expensive. You don't want something cheap and light, and despite the fact that it's a good vacuum, this Dyson feels cheap and flimsy.  My other complaint is the inadequate size of the dust canister and the fact that you have to reach in and pull out gunk with your fingers. I wouldn't pay this much money for a vacuum that was so messy to use - my beloved Fantom vacuum has an enormous dustbin and when you empty it out, all of the dirt and gunk easily falls into the trash can. I thought there was something wrong with the Dyson until I confirmed with someone else who owns one of these vacuums that this is how this model of Dyson works.  Updated review:  After a serious workout by a professional housecleaner, who cleaned our house from top to bottom, this vacuum did not hold up under the pressure. The small chamber that holds the dirt filled up way too quickly, and despite the dirt chamber being emptied several times, the vacuum actually started spitting dirt back out at her, and then the filter chamber became so hot to the touch that she finally gave up, unplugged the vacuum, drove home and came back with her own cheapie $80 Hoover to finish vacuuming my house. The Dyson failed in the hands of a professional user who cleans houses and mansions for a living. If this vacuum doesn't work right after I put the washed and dried filter back into it (you have to wait at least 24 hours for the filter to dry), I will be calling Dyson to ask what my next step should be.  Update #2:  Dyson customer service is FANTASTIC. Yes, my vacuum is still broken, but after spending over an hour with me on the phone, "troubleshooting" the basics, the rep sent a work order to a certified Dyson vacuum repair shop. I will have to take the vacuum to the shop, and I'll post a follow-up update after it gets repaired and return to me. It was very nice talking to someone from the Midwest - probably Iowa, not a worker in an overseas call center who was reading from a script. So maybe Dyson has the balance figured out - the vacuums are manufactured overseas, where production costs are lower, but at least for now, their call center is based in the United States. Also, I was on hold for a while with Dyson phone support, and then given the option of waiting for a call back, which came in about an hour. So I give Dyson five stars for great customer service, and I'll revise my low star rating once I get the vacuum back in working condition.  Update #3:  This vacuum has turned out to be way too fussy, picky and demanding. Hair, dirt and gunk gets caught up in the mechanisms way too easily and then you have to do a first-aid rescue. Seriously, save your money and buy some other brand of vacuum. I hate it, and it sits alone, unused and unloved, in a dark corner. I've gone back to using my beloved 14+ year-old Fantom, made by a company that Dyson acquired several years ago. My housecleaner also hates the Dyson and brings her Wal-Mart Hoover vacuum, which she said only cost her $60. This woman is particularly handy at fixing just about anything, but she hates both of my Dyson vacuums. So do I.	-1
it fits well.lots of breaks putting them on and getting them out of the box	-1
Meh	-1
Low grade.  30% of these rip out the gate, and they are so thin I double them.  I have worn gloves for EMS and light repairs, and never had problems like this.  I think these are flawed, maybe even a bad run that was sold regardless.  Thats the last box I will buy because they are not reliable, don't perform well, and at such a failure rate, too expensive when better options exist.	-1
Very poor quality of glove. I'm not sure how this achieved a 4+ start overall. Upon putting on these gloves and spraying for 2 minutes, there was already a hole in the pointer finger. Note, this is probably my 5th pack of different Nitrile gloves, so I have used a few different types. Since I'm working with vehicles most the time, these gloves will be gone like toilet paper and that's fine... if they work for super light duty, great..good luck.	-1
These are too thin - they rip when you look at them wrong.  Not suitable for use.  Buy different gloves!	-1
I bought these because the description said they could be used for grains.  These things are tiny.  I do not see how they could be used for grains.  Now hops yes these tiny things could be used for hops,  I was going to try a Brew in a Bag and ended just using the mash tun without a bag.  Again, not for brewing probably just hopping.  I really think they sent me the wrong bag.	-1
these things are tiny! good luck if you're steeping more than a half pound of grains	-1
These are made of a REALLY thin plastic. Feels like you can squeeze right through it. When applying very little pressure water will start coming out the threads. And they are about 1/3 the size of the standard ones.	-1
Bought this as an open box item. Opened up the box and the vacuum cleaner with filthy on the outside there was dirt in the bottom of the box. Opened up the vacuum and it was filthy inside as well. It required quite an effort to wash my hands after just looking at the item. Not sure how well it works yet. Have to give it one star because 0 is not an option.	-1
Pretty worthless. The field of view is so small and the image so lacking I cannot rave about this or the tool they attach to. This is one tool where a professional grade is an absolute must and no cheapie, even the not-so-cheap Supereyes, will do the job well.	-1
Don't fit the Goodan WIFI Borescope..	-1
Cheaply made and not effective.	-1
These are not mirrors, they are very thing reflective adhesive and the reflective coating rubs off at the slightest touch.  It appeared that the "mirror" was dirty so I attempted to clean it with *just* cotton (no solvent or anything) and the reflective coating came right off.  This is one of the worst purchases I've ever made.	-1
The things are not in focus	-1
Not very practical	-1
I cannot recommend these gloves. Less than 20% of them are usable. Most of them are melted together. Many of the remainder are degraded to the point of being useless. I strongly suggest picking another supplier and a different brand altogether. These are a waste of money. The attached picture is sample from the box.	-1
Hole spacing too close for accurate breadboard prototyping. Otherwise it is ok if you have tiny soldering irons and a lot of patience.	-1
Not what I expected......	-1
spend money to me, not easy to use	-1
bad, inaccurate, unpredictable, never the same reading twice	-1
have to recalibrate constantly	-1
waste of money	-1
None of these worked as near as I can tell. Don't know if I got a bad batch or what, but I've tried every possible wiring option and a variety of libraries for the Arduino that support the DS18b and have pretty much given up.	-1
do waist your money they last about 30 seconds on wood, spend the extra monet on the 3m green, they out last these by at leat 10 times	-1
Very little tinsel strength.  Snapped of the head off the first screw I used and I actually pilot hole drilled the screw hole.  save your money and buy a better quality SS screw.	-1
Purchased it was completely dried up, but I didn't use it tell about two months after purchase so couldn't return.  Buyer beware.	-1
I am giving this one star due to the bottle. I used this once and the rest was worthless within 5 minutes. There is not a proper seal on the top like brands such as Locktite and Krazy glue. I usually buy Locktite glue, but I took a chance on this because of the cheaper price and some of their other products worked for me. The gel itself worked fine the one time I used it, but the whole bottle solidified within 5 minutes. I will continue to buy Locktite super glue simply because you can use it to the last drop.	-1
I tried this on a turtle shaped floor lamp that had cracked in half. it didn't work at all, though i had trouble getting it off my fingers.	-1
Not a very good super glue. I couldn't get it to stick. Should have stayed with Loctite.	-1
Does what it should, good hold. However, the directions state to shake it before use, don't do that. I did and lost half the bottle when I took the cap off. Horrid mess	-1
Went through 10% of the spool before some very small foreign object clogged the nozzle.  Will stay away from this brand of filament.	-1
These weren't compatable with my sander, and were never used.	-1
I bought these because it had good reviews, I must had gotten a bad pair because mine are dull, I wouldn't trust them to cut paper much less anything on my body, I am very disappointed and will be looking for a different pair.	-1
Nice looking scissors but quality control for them is nonexistent. The blade cutting edges don't mesh and they leave a 1/2" (12.7 mm) gap at the tip where cutting is impossible. On the curved side the scissors are etched with "Germany Stainless" however, a magnet sticks to them so the stainless is of poor quality  and the scissors will probable rust. German steel is usually highly desirable so I think the etching on the scissors may be counterfeited so that a higher price can be demanded. I can't understand how this item has such a high rating. One star is too high.	-1
I don't think this instrument is accurate. When compared against the hydrometer, this brix meter is off about 6 brix. I have re-calibrated twice with distilled water and nothing changes: the meter is still off.	-1
I couldn't get the scale to calibrate correctly using exact water temperature measurements.  I measured this refractormeter against both my hydrometers and it was off by as much as .020. I had no issues returning the products and was quickly reimbursed.	-1
very tiny board	-1
good so far. but next to the switches it heats-up quickly. I am scared it will melt the plastic.  *New model is POS. Died on its own. reset button does not work. slashing the ratings.	-1
These plugs don't seem to be made of the correct metal. I tested an extension cable made with these plugs and they were very sensitive to temperature. I would recommend going to Omega and buying similar plugs that are made with the correct alloy.	-1
Screw terminals will not hold wires due to inadequate threads for terminal screws.	-1
Try as I may, getting the size I wanted failed. These tiny hooks are NOT for cups, unless you want hooks for kid's tea party cups. The gap for cup handles is a mere 12/32.  The gauge of the brass-colored material is close to that of 12 gauge wire, but a tad thicker, by actual measurement.  The overall length from tip to tip is 1 1/4 inches. The wood threads are close to that of a #4 wood screw, so that tells you how small these things are.	-1
Cheap material not meant for heavy duty mounting, just simple projects.	-1
These break easily. Not a fan.	-1
The picture on the listing is deceiving.  It would be cheaper to go to your own hardware store and pick out random amounts wood screws. The Hillman Group needs to be more up front with what the picture is showing.	-1
Cheap screw, head stripped so easily, even with a hand screwdriver.  Will not recommand.	-1
i was expecting  more, it is for just in case you need then for a very small project in the house. You are better making yourself this type packs from the hardware stores	-1
Ok	-1
Small head, not much use.	-1
Washers like washers... the box is useless as a storage. The plastic locking snap on broke like a twig. Cannot close it; only tape it. Where is the saving if the sorting storage is disposable? What's the point of "saving"? Toss it all to a brown bag and you will save one cent more.	-1
Items seem ok, but the box is missing 15 number 8 nuts making the whole thing short by 30 pcs as I do not need bolts without nuts.	-1
Very cheap screws that break of with the slights of pressure..  I understand over torquing it but I used the slightest of pressure to screw it in and it snapped off the dead	-1
Too small to do much with.	-1
Very cheap made.  Better to buy from hardware chain store.	-1
The newest trend in vacuums are the "compact upright" slim/lightweight profile vacuums. Most of them are under 12 pounds & around $50.  The Airspeed One is the compact version of the Eureka Airspeed product line. If you've read my other reviews, you'd know I'm a huge fan of Eureka. Their motors & suction are just as good Dyson, no joke.  The Airspeed One is only 10 amps (not 12), and it's not "lossless suction" (it has a cheap foam filter that can clog the whole works). But the motor & suction are still excellent, almost on par with the other Airspeed products, at about half the weight & half the price.  BUT... the Airspeed One has so many other flaws I do not recommend it.  It is cheaply made. They cut every corner possible. The handle & canister fall out easily. I'm constantly reassembling it. There is no upright lock position (the thing is falling over *all* the time). The parts are paper-thin plastic & break easily. The hose is very short & not stretch - you can't do the stairs, the ceiling fan, etc. The cord is too short. This is such a step backwards for Eureka, it just makes vacuuming a horrible chore.  Not to worry. There are 2 options I urge you to consider before making your decision.  The first is the Bissell PowerForce Compact. It has a little less suction than the Airspeed One (only 7 amps), but fewer problems. So I consider it a step up...and it's cheaper! Today, both the Airspeed One and the Bissell PowerForce Compact are $53 on Amazon, but the Bissell is only $39 at Walmart! That's 20% less for a more reliable machine.  However in my opinion the much better choice is the Eureka upgrade - the AirSpeed One "Turbo". It solves most of the problems I mentioned. It has a stretch hose, better on-board tools, the cord is 5 feet longer, & higher quality parts (it's built better). And while it's currently $75 on Amazon, it's only $53.99 at Walmart! In other words, get the upgraded version for the same price. A much better deal all around.  Please be aware that Amazon prices fluctuate, almost daily. Hope this helps - happy cleaning!	-1
Product does not contain any statements about being lead free.  In comparison, check valves carried by Lowe's or Home Depot - they print their lead free statements right on the handle.	-1
Valve handle cannot take much abuse, but for a smaller ball valve that is not surprising	-1
The product I received was only 3/4" wide not the 2" wide in the description.  The label on the tape said it was 2' wide but it only measured 3/4".	-1
work a few times	-1
Like other reviewers here, the one I received does not show the correct temperature. This gun is at least 6 to 8 degrees high. See my example picture. A temperature gun that gives you the wrong temp is completely useless! The company wants me to ship back to them at my own expense in order to get a new one sent to me. That's ridiculous. If they ship a useless product, they should ship you another.	-1
I didn't expect super accurate results at this price, but this is ridiculous.  The surface is hot to touch and the reading shows around 30 degrees Celsius.  Completely useless.	-1
It arrived with the protective lens rattling around inside the housing and the rest of the emitter loose inside as well. Amazon refunded my money without a problem but I ended up replacing it with a different make/model, Fluke 62 Max (which isn't comparable in price or build quality at all)	-1
Did not stay flat when heated. Cannot recommend.	-1
Cheap price, Cheap made.  Bristles pull out way too easily.  Used them to coat my truck frame so I didn't care but for any application where you might see paint, you'll end up with tons of bristles.	-1
I won't be ordering a second batch if these bottles,  of the 6 I've used so far all of them will eject the dropper the first time it's opened breaking the tamper seal.	-1
This was disappointing from the word go, these bottles are very thin and soft, the lock ring on most will not catch nor will they break off when you open the bottle they come off with the lid, out of about 100 bottles, about 20 went in the trash because the lids would not tighten down and just kept spinning, and about half of them I used leaked, by far very very disappointed with this product run, sorry about the bad review	-1
I have ordered the vktech bottles before. They were always well packed and clean and I've never had an issue until now. This time all the tips were missing and the bottles had leftover plastic all over them from the molding process. They were all just tossed into a bag (bottles,caps and dirt) and about half of the caps were missing the seal ring. On top of it all, they were covered in dust and dirt. It was disgusting. The bottles were not useable at all and without the tips and half the caps missing the seal ring, they would not have been useable for my e juice. I did get a refund though, thanks to the great customer service. The bottles and caps went into the trash. So they are worth ordering again because if they are not good, I know their customer service will help fix any issues I have.	-1
These are crap. After waiting over tree weeks to get them, they finally arrived. The first noticeable problem is that they're flimsy - vert thin plastic. I could live with that, but most importantly, the caps won't screw on tightly. You'll tear up your fingers trying, but even with pliers they won't screw on sufficiently to keep from leaking. Finally, the whole mess reeks of gasoline - after trying to screw on a few caps I threw the whole bag into recycling and washed my hands. A complete waste of money and time.	-1
great if you want but after trying it I did not like the big heavy roll. I'd rather have individual ones.	-1
Disappointing! Just opened the sealed bag of filament and tried to print with the blue.  Even at the lowest setting (.4mm) the filament was stringy and would not stick.  Again, I just opened the sealed bag this morning (16 April 2015), so moisture should have not been a reason for the filament to perform so poorly.  I don't know if this one I got was just a bad batch, but it sure is BAD Filament!  Edit #1:  Just to make sure it was not user error, I am testing the filament by printing a Sample file which is included in the Davinci printer. Tried the Yellow color filament and got the same horrible results as with the Blue filament.  Now I'm testing the Red color filament, and when that one is done I'll do the same with the Green color filament.  I will post pictures to show the results of all four colors when all the samples are done.  Edit #2: Finished printing the Davinci Sample file with all four colors.  The Red and Green filament worked flawlessly, but the Blue and Yellow filaments yielded poor print results.  I have included a picture so folks can see the difference.  A shame because two out of four is never a good thing...	-1
Huge bulky spool, very hard to keep the filaments tight with clips, colors are unattractive and this ABS warps bad.	-1
The bottle came damaged.  The bottle itself was crushed, while the spray head was scraped up as though it slid across a concrete floor.	-1
Loudest fan ever! I threw it away.	-1
The advertisement says this unit was rated by the "Japanese Consumer Protection Agency" but a web search does not reveal such an organization.  Can not verify the claim.	-1
Major POS. Ends are ground uneven and it wobbles so bad I beleive this crap is being sold and not thrown away. Set it on a piece of glass and it leans like the tower of pisa.	-1
Nice product but took Way too long to get here.	-1
not matching 6mm , does fit but its way too large to grab a 6mm shaft	-1
Does not include grub screws for flat shafts, in case you need to follow an existing alignment. Description says it does.	-1
Ordered three of them. Two were good, one is too small on the 6.35mm side. Even with the clamping screw loosened excessively. It is very difficult to get on the shaft. Tried it on several shafts of 6.35mm (1/4"). After forcing it onto the shaft, that axis is very loud. I think it's not aligned because of the fact that the bore is not the correct size.  Lesson #1. When buying Chinese parts. Always allow for failures as they seem to have no concept of quality control.  Did I save money buying Chinese? Not when you consider that now I have to order another to replace the one that doesn't work. Guess the lure of cheap prices got me again.	-1
Horriable!!	-1
Buyer Beware,  I have owned 2 of these robots.  They both will develop an electrical problem within a year and will continue to beep when you put it on the charger, They send a replacement and the second one begin doing the same thing, other words the robot is good for approximant one year at most.  Additionally the charger cradle is equally a waste of money.  Do yourself a favor and save the grief and aggravation and skip this unperfected robot that will turn out to be ready for the garbage can within a year.  As far as the cleaning goes when it does work it basically just spreads the dirt around evenly so its not noticed.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY	-1
My wife hated it.  We returned it.  Doesn't clean well at all.  Didn't use it long enough to review any other functions.	-1
I thought this would make my very small run an easy task, but this stuff is so thin it tears too easily. I did manage to get the run completed but I had to tape all the tears in it when I was done. Next time I'll just do it the correct way with the regular duct work pipe.	-1
We bought an Irobot vacuum last year and it was so good that we bought 2 more, one for each grown daughter.  We all still love those.  The success of the vacuum cleaner bots spurred us on to buy the mop bot while ignoring the bad reviews.  Almost all of the bad reviews we subsequently read happened on this one bot.  It has a terrible time connecting with the "navigation system".  Even on the rare occasion when we could get it to connect, it would not connect in the mop mode without first connecting in the sweep mode and then turning it off and on and back to the mop mode.  Most of the time when it ran into something it would end up going round and round in counterclockwise backward circles.  Eventually it would fail and give the signal that the space it was cleaning was too small!  Duh!  That'll happen when you run in tight, backward circles.  I really hope that Irobot gets this thing perfected and working as well as the vacuum bots.  I am surprised that that would sell such an imperfect item that besmirches their good reputation.  Maybe the ones made on Tuesday afternoon work!	-1
MY BAD, i ordered the wrong part.. 1/4" is not a standard.. know the size.. For me it was refrigerator water line.. different completely	-1
I don't think it actually works.  I tested the hard water out of the well, it was really hard.  I tested the water coming out of the water softener, it still said it was really hard.  The softened water tastes like softened water and feels like softened water.  I was going to use these test strips to adjust the hardness setting on the water softener.  I just don't trust them	-1
I bought two of these. They were not needed and sat until four months later.  Neither bottle sprayer would spray a mist. It was either a stream with drops or a steady stream. That makes both of then completely worthless/.	-1
2 days, spring blew out and it was next to impossible to fix. So.many better brands , these suck	-1
I am an certified Auto AC technician and installed this valve pursuant to the directions to recharge a sealed refrigerant system.  After the install, I checked for leaks and the valve leaked, I tightened the screws more, and still a leak.  I then tightened the screws to the max and still a leak.  Now I have a hole pieced in the tubing and need to cut out the pierced tubing, solder new tubing in place then return to the original problem which was low refrigerant.  This time I will cut the tube at the compressor, vacuum the system and crimp/solder the tube to complete the repair.  What I'm left with after purchasing this valve, is wasted time, the money to purchase the valve, spend money for the tubing repair and will have to buy another can of R134A.  Don't waste your time with this valve.  Complete the repair properly the first time and save your money and time.	-1
Never worked. Ripoff	-1
I was trying to use this to be able to tell the temperature of a metal component on an electronics project.. and I could only measure as high as 39C. When in fact the component was actually too hot to touch.. and with a Fluke thermocouple I measured over 80C. I tried for an hour (thinking to myself perhaps I wasn't aiming it right).. and doing all sorts of angles and distances with little to no luck.  This isn't the first time this unit has failed to actually show the right temperature.. I suspected it might be wrong, but now I know for sure. The other problem is there is no way to shut off the meter. It goes into standby mode which drains 5uA worth of current (measured with my Keithley 2015 6 1/2 digit bench meter). This is really annoying because I only need to measure temperatures once in a blue moon.. picking up a thermometer only to find its battery drained is really annoying and costly. A physical On/Off switch was I guess too expensive to implement.  So for anyone thinking this cheap unit will work for Electronics.. look elsewhere.	-1
Not very accurate.  Fun to use as a toy, but no real use for grilling or cooking.	-1
egh! 20 bucks what did I expect? Not accurate and not user friendly with the buttons	-1
seems to work - after a year the laser quit -- my cat is very angry -- but I can tell how hot he is	-1
base is not flat or square. magnet is very weak.	-1
Very poor quality.  As cheap as they are, they're still not with the price (even if they were free).	-1
junk pure junk	-1
A word of caution, I bought the package of these and used 3 of them in an application where I needed to solder, in all 3 cases they malfunctioned immediately..Funny thing is when I just twisted the wire on to the POT's legs then used heat shrink tubing, they worked fine. So I have a hunch that the internal wiper is a lighter plastic and cannot withstand the heat from soldering, so IF you do not solder the legs on the POT your OK, otherwise it's a gamble..	-1
To be short, these short out. If you have them connected to a microcontroller, you will quickly heat up your electronics and get that festive blue smoke smell of overheated components. I was careful and ohm'ed them out to check for shorts, but it turns out that they short in odd places in the middle of the turns and I didn't catch those.  If you are dead set on using these, you need to add current limiting resistors in front of your pots.  That is, add a ~1k Ohm resistor in series to keep your current from flying off the ball.  You will need to do the maths using Ohm's law and knowledge of basic circuit theory to compensate for that added resistor.  You could also buy nicer pots with the same sized shafts and just use the knob covers.	-1
Their customer service demanded pictures as evidence, not worth my time.  I'll use them somewhere else someday, but not for my current need.  I no longer buy from Amico.	-1
didint stick to build platform and nor did the prints	-1
30 days top on the tarp then they break	-1
cheap and dirty - not in a good way.	-1
Inaccurate temperatures; is always 2 to 5 degrees off. Also skips numbers, i.e., 75, 76 and 78 degrees always reads 77. This is one weird piece of crap. DO NOT purchase.	-1
The unit I received was not accurate. I tested it and compared it to my thermostat in my house  along with other thermostats I have. I also compared it to another unit I bought here that has a wireless receiver. And tested against my local weather station reports. This unit was 20% off on the humidity and 10-15 off on the temp.	-1
I had wondered why my very expensive sapplings were dying since I was monitoring them so closely.  After reading reviews about this montor, I checked the digital readout for temperature against that of several very dependable thermometers and this instrument reads 5 DEGREES TOO LOW!  I was cooking my sapplings because I thought the temperature was low enough to keep them out of the risk of harm.  I do not know about the hygrometer; but, if the reading were important to me, I would also check it against other reliable sources.  These reviews helped me find the deadly link in my plant growing setup.  The temperature gauge was very inaccurate!  Display quit working several months after it arrived.  Undependable.	-1
Works great but it keep resetting it's self so I'm not able to keep a close eye on the highs and lows ... it won't keep the recorded high or low for more then few hours	-1
worked fine for about a month, but hasn't kept accurate temp for at least a week. now some portions of digits not displaying. and reading 10F indoors. actual temp is about 70F. tried new batteries. same exact result. can't return after 30 days - i tried. also, the INCREDIBLY SMALL DISPLAY on this thing isn't much larger than a book of matches. definitely wouldn't buy again. i tend to like Amazon recommendations, but ended up with a real dud, this time.	-1
I don't know why it would say 45% humidity is low and 29% humidity is ok this don't seem very accurate to me.	-1
it diding not work.	-1
Doesn't work very well humidity doesn't seem to change and the temperature doesn't change at all	-1
Not accurate in both temperature and humidity reading when compared to furnace/thermostat and humidifier settings.  Product also not eligible for return.	-1
Useless for humidity. Humidity was consistently 10% off versus 2 other humidity gauges I have.	-1
Reads 77 degrees all the time, tried taking out the batteries to reset it a few times and still 77 degrees. Past the return period so I guess I'll use it for a paper weight.	-1
Wanted another digital thermometer /hygrometer for another room & foolishly went with this acu-rite junk when I should've bought same 1 I had. Temp off by a good # of degrees & humidity way off.   I have a no frills, inexpensive basic as it gets 1 that says Thermo meter on bottom & it's insanely accurate.  Fast reads too. Then this acu-wrong junk & another crap brand that reads 19% humidity all the time, except in excessive humidity which will read around 21%. Wrong! Both r fancier than my perfect basic 1 but useless.  I'll take my boring looking, super accurate 1 all day over these junkers.	-1
I have had this now for a year and it is inaccurate by 5 degrees Fahrenheit.  I have set the a/c in the house to 78 and it shows 73.  I have also tested the area this sits with an infrared thermometer and that shows the temperature to be 77.8.  I even changed the battery.  Who knows how accurate the humidity sensor is.  Not sure how this has so many good reviews.	-1
I bought this a few months ago, and already doesn't work. The seller, Chaney Instruments, should refund my money. I never dropped it or mishandled it. It is only 2 months hold, yet it doesn't work any longer. The numbers on it or all distorted. Even when it did work, it didn't make sense. It would show my lowest temperature recorded inside my place at 72 degrees F, yet when looking at my current temp, it showed 68. Go figure.	-1
I've had one for about a year.  Trusted it completely.  Liked it so much - especially the 24 hour hi/low function, I bought 3 more for my new greenhouse.  Can't trust any of them.  You be the judge - see the photos.	-1
worked for less than a month before it just stopped working.	-1
I found the temperature measurements for this unit to be way off in the short-term, compared against 3 other extremely accurate units. I expected this thing to update fairly quickly, but in hindsight this unit is better for reading the average temperature and humidity of a room over the course of a day, rather than obtaining a new temperature measurement within minutes. Would not recommend for use with an indoor garden.	-1
Why Bother With Reviews, Amazon deletes the truth when it hurts.	-1
I've had this unit less than a mount and it's dead. The screen has died and is so dim that it's unreadable and it's ineligible for a refund/return. Avoid this, spend a little more and get something quality.	-1
Stopped working after 10 months. No joy getting it fixed or replaced.	-1
Just arrived today. Put 2 different batteries in it and didn't work. Great that Amazon was able to refund me but I wanted a working item. Poor quality control on manufacturer.	-1
I have many of these cheap hygrometers (different models and brands) and none of them are anywhere near accurate with RH or even temp. You get what you pay for.	-1
Arrived non-functional. After inserting the battery the screen lit up and it displayed 14 degrees F and 16% humidity. I thought it just needed to calibrate or something along those lines well after sitting for several minutes it refused to read anything other than 14/16. The only button on the device is to switch from F to C and all that did was display the same wrong temp in C.	-1
The battery cover was jammed shut. The fragile supporting hinge for the monitor stay came off in the effort to open the battery cover. The display appears to be good otherwise.	-1
It stopped displaying clearly after one month. I have had good luck with AcuRite up to now so I purchased another. Time will tell.	-1
Lasted less than a month before display failed (became garbled). Tried new battery.	-1
As other reviewers have noted, this thing is not accurate. Compared to other hygrometers, it gives very inaccurate readings. Cheap, disappointing, prolly made in China...	-1
Trash. Sprinkle a little water on these things and it'll stop working instantly. Had to buy three more just because of that issue. Needs to be water proof	-1
It worked great, for exactly 34 days.  Then the numbers started disappearing.  See photo.  Makes use impossible.  New battery did not help.  Frustrating, because I did like it.	-1
I have 2 side by side...and they are 2 degrees different always.	-1
the humidity is 6-8 5 off & temp. is 2 degrees off. & seller has not got back to me.	-1
These things are straight junk...  Bought 6 of them and almost  all broke within 2 months of buying them...  2 came with broken clips, I really don't care about that...  5 of the 6, the magnets' glue came off so the magnets won't stick to the device...  3 so far are showing partial numbers for the temp and humidity, making them unreadable and useless....	-1
I bought two of these to compare humidity in two apartments. I thought I would sit them together so I could callibrate any differences. See the photo for how they are right out of the box.  Probably just a case of one bad unit, but that doesn't help me today, when I was counting on using them. And, I don't even really know which one to send back, or if the one that's more likely right is close to actually being right.	-1
I bought two. They were both Way off in regards to humidity. With semi-calibrated equipment I knew the room was about 68% humidity, but both units read 40% & 41% respectively. I ordered these two units a week apart, so I doubt they were "next" to each other during assembly. Amazon DOES NOT honor returns unless you write them and ask really really nice. That was a first for me after ten years of being a prime member.	-1
New review after using it for over a year: It's not accurate. I have it right next to a more accurate and precise humidity monitor and this one is up to 6% off. Pay the extra few dollars and get one that does what it's supposed to.  Original review when I first got it: Very helpful and easy to set up and use. Clear, large, easy to read data give me exactly what I need. I like how it has the highs and lows for the last 48 hours too.	-1
5 degree off (lower) than actual temperature. Had to throw it into the trash can.	-1
It's nice but it seems to resolve temps by 2 degrees. Mine reads out only temp odd-numbered temps, so if it's 72 degrees, I won't know it. If you're going to buy a thermometer, it seems to me that a 1-degree resolution is not too much to ask.	-1
I have been using four of these units in my basement for the past three months.  Last night I decided to check them for consistency.  I place all four next to each other.  After 15 minutes, all four units had different humidity readings.  I left them together over night; this morning, they are all different again.  CRAZY different, ranging from 63% to 72%.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!	-1
it's very unresponsive to changes in temperature or humidity. I'm beginning to question its overall accuracy.  Good to use to get an idea of the temperature or humidity of somewhere if you let it sit for a couple hours to equalize, but not useful for short-term purposes like testing out an AC system in a small room.	-1
I have ordered these twice about a year apart.  In total I purchased 6 units.  5 of them read within a % of each other.  One is way off...by 10 to 15%.  Although I would have liked all 6 to be matched this is not bad for such an inexpensive device.  I use mine to check my photographic equipment humidity box and to check the levels in the house.  Good product.  Have not bothered to contact Amazon or the vendor about the one bad unit.  Perhaps I will....perhaps too much trouble.  I am pleased with the product.  BTW two of my units (both read accurate) have been running over a year on the battery....so I think this is low battery consumption.  Very pleased.  UPDATE 5/27/16 I lowered my rating to two stars.  This review is not only the product but on Amazon.  Yes Amazon ..I have been a PRIME member for several years and make many many purchases.  I decided to return the one bad unit and the online information states I have till June 2 to initiate a return.  But when I go through the return process it states the item is not eligible for return and provides me a link to the return policy.  Of course I can not find anything that is associated with this device.  So...the product is good if you can accept a failure rate of 1 in 6 and can accept a no-return policy.  I figure this is worth 2 stars.  Sorry Amazon....I still love your service but this time you did not come through.	-1
First off, I have TWO of these units, the first I'd purchased from Amazon, the second was a replacement sent free by Amazon when I requested a return on the first due to accuracy issues. I also have several vintage weather stations, with USA-made, mechanical hygrometers which I trust to be fairly accurate. Those all read within a few % of each other. I have them in several locations around my house, but wanted a small, unobtrusive temp/humidity gauge for my daughter's room that wouldn't detract from her 'decor'.  To test the first unit I'd received I simply put it in my basement (where the humidity doesn't fluctuate widely unless it's raining) next to wall-mounted weather station for comparison. The 'Accurite' unit ALWAYS READS WAY UNDER the actual room humidity - sometimes as close as 8% under, but usually more, like 12% under.  The second unit I received as replacement acts much like the first, although their readings for humidity always differ from each other, usually they're as close as 2%, but sometimes as much as 6%, and it stays that way for hours (so it's not some sudden change like the furnace coming on that's the problem). I should note their temperature display is pretty close, within 1-2 degrees of actual - close enough to work with,  if only the hygrometer were as accurate.  The reviewer who claimed to have subjected theirs to a test chamber and praised it's resulting accuracy...maybe the hygrometers in these units only work well in a test chamber. I need something to work in my home, and a bogus reading of 39% when the actual humidity is 51% is pathetic.  FYI, while writing this review I found a website that shows up close to the top of googled results for 'hygrometer', 'nwclimate.org', that hosts an article titled '8 Best Digital Hygrometers Suitable for Your Home', with this 'AcuRite' model making the top of the list. Considering their numerous spelling and grammatical errors (even the article's title is awkward), and their (unintentionally lukewarm) recommendation of this unit, describing the hygrometer function as 'good accuracy if you are not interested in the exact percentage; for relative ranges it does a good job', I'd judge these devices to be the cheapest made and hardest-sold imported junk on the web.	-1
I give this a 1, only because it worked for 2/3 of a year woohoo, zero would be more appropriate.  This is junk. Spend your money on something better.	-1
Works great for a brief period then starts being completely wrong. You have to remove the battery to reset it and it will work for another short period. It will read 16 degrees in my house when it's obviously near 70 degrees.	-1
lasted a week	-1
Very inaccurate. Would not buy again.	-1
This reads a different temperature and humidity than my thermostat when sitting right below it.	-1
Worked for about 2 weeks then it was dead. No return correspondence from the seller.	-1
I've read some thermometers not reading odd temperatures has to do with the math it's using to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Mine will never read 76, 78 or 80. I'm not okay with a digital thermometer with a margin of error of almost 3 degrees.  Oddly, the 78 on the product picture is something it can't actually read.	-1
This is not a very product, its really the next best thing next to garbage.  So far I have tried this with a Crane humidifier and a Sharper Image  and they both read 16%. according to the AcuRite.  Bought a Vornado Plus 3 from Amazon and waiting for delivery.  If it measure the same thing with the Vornado, back it goes.	-1
Doesn't appear to be accurate to me. It's hard to tell for sure because which one is authoritative. I have 4 thermometers including this one. My use case is an incubator and this isn't nearly accurate enough. When the incubator says 33% humidity this thing will read 60%. When the temp says 104F and my other two thermometers say 98F I'm gonna believe the other two. I decide to try a different use case and stuck it on top of my furnace thermostat that's digital and this one said 68 and the thermometer said 70. So I bought another thermometer with Hygrometer. I get a 3rd off the wall reading that doesn't match up with the incubator or this hygrometer. My best guess is this this is plus or minus about 2-3 degrees off. Hygrometer I have no idea I have 3 readings varying from 30 - 60% humidity and I don't trust any of them. The 3rd thermometer lined up with another thermometer, but this one was 4 degrees higher. When a few degrees matters don't get this one. I also notice it doesn't update regularly it seems to update every couple minutes because it makes several degree jumps at regular intervals, instead of a steady transition. I wouldn't recommend it. I could probably guess at the same accuracy. I think you could find a better one.	-1
Not accurate at all in terms of humidity. If you are looking for a useful humidity reading, look elsewhere. This was quite a bit off (checked against my precision cigar hygrometer).	-1
The temperature readout is off by 4 deg F.  I do not have a way to verify the humidity readout.  I would look for another item if you want accuracy.  I will have to purchase something else, by another mfg.	-1
Stopped working after just a few weeks waste of time and money could not handle the humidity	-1
Let me say I LOVE the size and ease of reading this meter, so much so when I opened it I considered instantly ordering a 2nd unit.  I just got it today and my house is set at 72 degrees and stays 72 without a problem, I put a fresh (tested) AA duracell battery into this and set in a corner away from vent and window light, it's sat here for just over 2 hours yet still reads 80 degrees.  I can see it being off a degree or two or even 3 maybe but reading 80 in a 71 degree room is quite odd, I even brought my outdoor thermometer inside and it reads 72 solid as a rock, so I am kinda bummed/stumped as to why this still reads 80 vs the actual room temperature.	-1
Can't calibrate the humidity reading.  Was over 10% low off after I did the salt test (put a bottle cap of damp salt in a baggie with the thermometer for 12+ hours and it should read 75% humidity)	-1
Hmmm. No back light or date. Keep looking.	-1
The LCD on this item has gone faulty after a month of sitting in a normal room. As you can see in the photo, the Humidity value is now un able to be read. Yes it can be implied, but that is not the point. Do not buy this item.	-1
don't work very good but you get what you pay for	-1
Update. This unit is a complete failure. It worked great at first. Then it started giving odd readings. I changed the battery with a brand new Duracell, and that worked for perhaps the first 3 months, just sitting there on the dining room table. Now it says it is 79F when it can not be more than 70 in here right now. I've seen readings on this piece of junk that were a lot farther off the mark than that.  Taking out the battery and reinserting it does no good, it does not 'reboot' it just instantly shows the past erroneous reading.  Original: This really helps us monitor humidity levels and keep them below levels that support mold and mildew growth. Also, flea larvae die under low humidity conditions, and this tool helped me achieve that to destroy the life cycle of fleas.	-1
Purchased this device to use alongside a Caliber III digital hygrometer for the purpose of dialing in the humidity setting on our Frigidaire FAD704DWD dehumidifier.  The humidistats on the Frigidaire and many other dehumidifiers are notoriously inconsistent and by having a couple of independent sources of info as to the RH in the room, I am able to more accurately establish an appropriate setting (regardless of the skewed number that may be displayed on the dehumidifier).  Unfortunately, after close monitoring over a period of several days, it appears that the AcuRite consistently reads 5% or so below the actual room RH based upon readings from other devices.  The temperature reading was (usually) within a degree (Farenheit) of the other devices but it was the RH that I was after.  Sending this unit back for replacement.  If the replacement fares no better, I will return and request a refund.  (Will update this review upon testing.)  UPDATE:  Received second unit and it proved to be less accurate than the one it was to replace.  Returned for refund.	-1
does not tolerate cold very well for very  long.  Don't waste your money.	-1
Bought two of these (cheap in price) units.  Have them side by side.  One can say 53% humidity and it's High, the other reads Low.  One reads 59 for temp and  the other 54.  So precision is not seen in these units, then again, neither is a high cost.  So maybe you get what you pay for?  Wish I knew which was accurate.  I believe the temp (and possibly humidity) is a 24hr history.  I've seen mine have a low temp of 54 and the next day a low temp of 58.	-1
It looks much thinner (an attractive design) in product photo. I certainly would not have ordered it if I had known what it really looks like.	-1
Ordered this to measure humidity in our basement after doing crawlspace encapsulation to address a moisture issue.  According to this gauge, the humidity is 16%, maxing out at 21% in every room of our house, even inside the washing machine and my cigar humidor.  I drilled some extra holes in it to see if that'd help - nope, still reads a constant 16% and will occasionally jump to 21% for no apparent reason.  But hey, at least the temp reads correctly, even though that's not the stated purpose of the unit.  100% junk!!	-1
I have one of these that is about 10 years old and works flawlessly, and is very accurate for temp AND humidity. I bought another to take to work and set it up beside my veteran unit and the temps match but the humidity is WAAAAYYYY off. The new unit reads humidity around double what the room actually is. I keep a room in the house very dry, for computer and firearms, with dehumidifier canisters/silica in 3 points of the room, and it stays very dry, but this new unit still reports 45-55% when the other one is consistently 25-27%. I'll have to try a different brand. Very disappointed.	-1
Which is correct? The one I received will stay at the same temperature and humidity regardless of conditions in the room. You have to pick it up and disturb it to get it to "update" the humidity and temperature, and even then the results will show wild swings. Quite frustrating because I don't know when the gauge is being accurate or not.	-1
Do not buy at Amazon.com since it's under $10 at Home Depot (4 stars at their price) and you can easily return it but I doubt you will sine it work just as well as their more expensive units.  It is within 1 degree and 1 humidity percentage of one of their weather units I also have.	-1
Well, not really that long.  I set it up in my offce and after about two hours the readings settled out at 70 degrees and 23 % humidity.  I turned on the humidfier and the humidity reading dropped to 13% and temp climbed to 72 degrees overnight.  Neither indication would change not matter what the temp or humidty really was.  Amzon, as always,  made returning it simple and my refund was recieved almost immediately.	-1
I bought two of these and put them side by side.  They were 2 degrees off each other temperature wise.  One was 2 degrees lower than a known good thermometer.  They were 5% off of each other for humidity.	-1
This died within a few hours of being put in a high humidity terrarium.  I really can't comment on the accuracy or battery life or anything else since it died so quickly.  The screen just went blank.  New batteries did not bring it back to life.	-1
A few of the numbers on the screen stopped working, then a few days later the whole screen went out.  Tried new batteries... no go.  It only lasted a few months.  Don't think I'll buy another...	-1
I found that the product reads temperatures 4F off againist 3 other independent thermometers...If 4degree F does not make any differance for you buy one otherwise I suggest more accurate device (which ever that may be)	-1
Notice that they never mention the word accuracy in the add... I didn't! Now, I guess that's because they are so inaccurate they can't claim anything!! At 75 degrees, a calibration device shows the one i just received to be off as much as 3 degrees. That's a roughly 4% error of reading. Too much for me.  Also, how long do we have to read the max recorded temp for the day before it goes away?? 3 hrs? 6 hrs? Midnight? When??  They don't say......  so how are we supposed to know??  Bummer!!	-1
Pro's: *  Only takes 1 AA battery (not included). *  Min/max readings on the display, for both temp & humidity. *  Refrigerator magnet on the back.  Con's: *  Temp display could only display ODD temperature values (75F, 77C, 79C) maybe due to internal C to F conversion using integer math.  Funny it could not display 78F as in the Amazon product photo. *  Spec'd temp range is a pitiful +/-4F (an 8 degree inaccuracy range).  In my case, the temp display was usually 2F off (your results may vary). *  Humidity reading was also out of spec (7% too high, versus a spec'd +/-5%). *  Display was slightly harder to read in a dark room than other LCD thermometers I have tried, and is not back-lit.	-1
Bought two.  Supposed to be +/- 5% accuracy.  These are right next to one another, not accurate at all.  They do not read the same humidity, ever.  One could say that one is off by a percent of the other, but that's not true either: right next to one another on a table, in front of my humidifier, in a dry room, where ever I place them, they can be as little as 5 mmHG apart, and as much as 9 mmHg apart in readings.  When they are right next to one another.  The temp readings are the same.  Completely unreliable for humidity, which is why I bought them.  This brand is complete junk.	-1
I BOUGHT THIS UNIT FOR MY LIVING ROOM. SO I DON'T NEED TO GO INTO ANOTHER ROOM FOR MY WEATHER STATION. I AM IN NC. THE WEATHER CHACEL CLAMES LEE CO. IS AT 94% . MY STATION IS ON 92%. THIS ACURITE UNITE IS 16% BLINKS UP TO 20 OR 21 % AND BACK TO 16. I EVEN CALLED SOME OTHER PEOPLE TO CHECK THERES. NO ONE WAS EVEN CLOSE TO 16. THEY DID VERRY BUT ALL WITH IN REASON. THE TEMP WAS + OR - 3 DEG. NOT GOOD FOR ME. ALL 9 OF MY DIGITAL AND IR UNITS ARE WITH IN 1/2 DEG. SO I CAN NOT RECONMEND THIS UNIT FOR ANY ONE, IT IS ONLY A CUTE PAPER WEIGHT. STAY AWAY FOLKS.	-1
Mediocre.  Seems to work OK bu the documentation is terrible.  Mine won't stay connected to a PC to allow me to upgrade the firmware.  Debating whether to return and spend a little more for something by a real test equipment company, even if I have to buy used.  Edit: never could get it to stay connected and update so it went back.  Waste of time.  Edit May 20:  Seller is trying to get me to remove the one star review.  They asked me to try another unit which they sent me free of charge, saying I must have gotten a bad one.  I reluctantly agreed and of course the new one has the same problem.  Seller has sent me numerous messages asking me to remove the 1-star review, each with differing suggestions.  One said it can't be upgraded.  Another gave instructions, that don't work, for connecting to it via USB and doing an upgrade.  They've asked me to return it 3 different ways, the last of which isn't even an available option.  Done wasting my time--sending all their email to spam and tossing the thing.	-1
Too tiny, returned.  Had to buy too many.	-1
With a one ampere load it read 1.875 amperes, calibration trim had no effect. (at 320ma it read 497ma) I returned it for a replacement and hope I'll have better luck with the next one.  I like the the fact that this meter has screw terminal for connecting large (14AWG?) cables for the current carrying circuit. I like the independent powered operation. I would have loved the three decimal (ma) readout and also the ability to monitor up to 10A loads. UPDATE 09/12/15 Amazon didn't get the replacement to me before they had received the return item. I returned it also. Prime, free (prepaid) two day shipping on returns, but not on replacement.	-1
The product works well. However, 1 star for providing no instructions and making me waste 15 minutes trying to figure out what all the different modes are.  Include instructions with your products, especially when they have ridiculous custom designations that are specific to your product.	-1
cord started to short out quite easily and never really worked for my 3d printer. At lest it was cheap... I hardly moved the cord around and never untied it. somehow it started shorting out when testing it. Kinda like a crappy phone/power cord would after quite a bit of use, but a lot sooner and less use.	-1
Not worth the money spent, cheap at the Marts	-1
Super thin, this stuff is not very good.  I don't normally write bad reviews but I would not buy this stuff again.	-1
This tape is absolute crap.  My father-in-law had a stroke.  We had to move him and mom into our house.  There was no time to play games.  Get packed and get moved.  I used this tape.  EVERY SINGLE BOX FELL APART!!!  On most of them, the tape just peeled away from the box while sitting there.  No, there was not humidity.  No, it was not too cold.  I hung plastic in the basement with it.  Came down 2 hours later, all the plastic is on the floor.  Some was on wood, most on duct work.  It all fell off.  I need to double-check, but I really hope this wasn't a Prime deal.	-1
Receivedmy Drok PWM DC Motor Speed Control today.. On top of it was a card saying they thank me for my review so here it is! Unpackaged it and removed the clip on top to remove the blue tape that was on it, noticed the capacitor was bent over with no support and one of the legs hadn't been soldered goo enough to hold. Strike one... Next I noticed the heat sink wasn't setting square so i removed the screw holding it down and found the 3 power transistors were hanging on by one leg on each of them. Strike Two. So I brought out the magnifying lamp and bot were they stingy with the solder hardly anything was completely soldered down. Strike three you're out! WOW what pathetic workmanship and if anyone inspected this HMMMMM well you know. Very Sad.	-1
I bought two of these , one stop working after 7 hours	-1
Poor quaility. Would not order again and would definately not recommend them	-1
$8 at time of purchase. These are junk. Now I understand what they meant when they told me to get good tweezers. The tips don't line up, the edges are rounded in all the wrong places, one tweezer was bent to hell. No, these are not "anti-magnetic." At least they come with a carrying case.  I'll repeat the wisdom of literally every electronics guy ever: Save yourself the trouble. Get yourself nice tweezers.	-1
Not very sturdy, bend too easy. Spend more money and get a better product.	-1
These look nice until you take the protective tip caps off.  The bodies are well formed, the paint is even, the white markings are clear.  That is where the good news ends.  As soon as you take the protective plastic caps off you see that the tips are all crudely finished, mismatched, don't meet well, and the combinations of bodies and tips are not shaped so as to give good holding pressure.  These are the size and shape of precision tweezers used in electronics work, but they perform so poorly at holding and manipulating small objects that I wouldn't even buy these for children or students (where I would expect tools to suffer abuse and neglect).  Frankly I'm mystified that the review profile is anywhere near as good as it is.	-1
worst tweezers I have ever purchased. I actually feel guilty for buying a waste of material like this. tweezer tips do not cleanly meet and so they are effectively useless.	-1
Tweezers are ok for what they are.... buyer beware.... when it says in stock it means in stock in China..... do not hold your breath waiting to receive these	-1
thought these would be better - the metal bends easily - looks like low grade metal and sharpened by hand on a grinder - i was expecting precision grade here - but no... not at all ... don't bother with this.. plus the shipping took forever	-1
its just ok for the price, no hi quality, the nose of the tweezers are not perfectly line up.	-1
Bad knock-offs and NOT the tweezers pictured. They are smaller, and made of soft cheap metal, with lousy tolerances at the tips, and even worse machining, and have no markings of any kind unlike the Vetus tweezers in the pictures where the name has been photoshopped out.  I am surprised they survived the shipping.	-1
cheapppppppppp. look like they will break looking at them 2 hard	-1
Several did not close properly. I had to bend them so they would line up. Took over 4 weeks to get them!!	-1
order was short two pair of tweezers	-1
Doesn't work well for me (using Flashforge Creator Pro with PEI bed). First layer doesn't stick well and lamination is not good. I tried different temperatures (up to 240c) but still not good. I had better success with other non black filaments from Hatchbox and  IC3D. I recently gravitate more and more to Hatchbox ABS filaments, better price and so far they all gave me very good printing results.  Edit: added a picture with sample prints with Hatchbox yellow, IC3D red, IC3D blue and IC3D black (the subject of my review). The IC3D black I got underperforms consistently, except for very simple models.	-1
Don't waste your time. Worst filament brand on the market IMHO	-1
Junk filament. Doesn't work I have tried numerous time and still get the same results.	-1
Got this spool based on the reviews, but it didn't work as praised.  Yes, it was working perfectly fine at first, but then it took a turn for the worse. I don't actually know how much filament comes in the spool length wise, but according to my Davinci printer, I've used 190 meters.  Well, the filament now comes out stringy, and makes popping noises when being extruded.  Humidity should not be a factor because the printer is set up in a climate controlled room.  I switched the spool and installed the Davinci filament cartridge, and that works perfectly fine.  I think I got a bad batch. I wish I could get a completely 100% good filament spool, but it seems to be hit and miss.  Because of that, I just can't recommend it.  Edit March 16th, 2015:  IC3D contacted me about the filament spool that went bad.  They quickly sent out a new spool of black filament as a replacement free of charge.  Their communication and customer service is TOP NOTCH in my book.  As soon as my current spool of filament runs out, I'll pop in the new one they sent me.  If it performs half as good as their customer service does, I'll be a happy camper and adjust the rating immediately.  Thanks again, IC3D!	-1
Dont buy!! Prints come out great then they come out like crap ended up trashing more then half my made parts and i have a company to run here.	-1
I had problems with this filament being out of round. It was out of spec according to their descriptions, so much so that the filament would jam in the printer feed tube due to melted filament oozing back up the filament tube.  Customer service was very good about sending me a second spool. The new spool was within their stated specs but is still significantly out of round. This makes estimating the filament size for the printer settings tricky but I have not had any more printer jams.  They requested my feedback on what I thought of the new filament. So, after about a month I gave them my feedback but didn't get any response.  I give customer service 4 stars for promptly addressing my initial issue.	-1
Junk! Ordered this relay July 2015 for a sailboat shorepower/inverter auto transfer switch. Just installed and found two issues! First it hums/vibrates from the 60hz coil transmitting the noise through fiberglass, quite noticeable with everything else off in the boat! Second one of the 30A lugs rivet was loose causing an intermittent connection!  If you can put up with 60hz hum and gamble on QA then this might work for you, otherwise skip it!  One other detail - the rivets are plain steel holding plated copper. Another long term point of failure around saltwater over time. I had already made a Lexan cover but fortunately had not installed.  Now going the manual switch route.	-1
Insanely BUZZY	-1
Super low quality syringes. The plunger either doesn't travel smoothly, or the tip of it pops off when you're drawing in liquid. Don't waste your money, find another manufacturer to buy your 1ml syringes from.	-1
Straight trash, I bought them to squirt oil on a hard to get to bearing. Funny thing is, one use, and the rubber gasket tears off of the plunger stem when you pull it a second time.	-1
Ordered to install in my brew structure.  Thickness is not enough to hold its own weight or resist acute bending.  It folds on itself very easily causing kinks.  I won't order it for this purpose again.	-1
So 1 of mine arrived with the broken inlets and outlets just like several other people here in the reviews. They seem to run ok, not super powerful, but probably enough for my use case. I'm giving them 2 stars because it is obvious that the broken inlets and outlets are an ongoing issue that is not being addressed. I don't have time to go out of my way to send it back, wait, then order another one.	-1
As a vacuum pump it sux, but I haave a pretty good 12V motor now..	-1
I read all the negative reviews yet I decided to take the chance. Needless to say, they were right! These things hardened way to quick and are almost impossible to work with.  I found the only way to use them was to use a heat gun on tin foil, but that makes them almost too hot to handle. For my use, these were not worth the trouble.	-1
Beware!  These are not the size that is advertised on Amazon or as stated on the packaging.  The holes for the [3/16"] terminals are actually 5/16" and the [5/16"] terminals are actually 3/8".  They appear as expected but much larger than they are supposed to be.  I will be returning them because they are much too large to work with the DC power studs on the AC inverter I had intended to use them with.	-1
Purchased with MP's Ultimate printer (Wanhao D6). This and the tiny rolls of filament packaged with machine are worst I've ever used.	-1
This filament is cheap - and it is cheaply made.  I have printed with a couple rolls - both were very tangled - repeatedly jamming from tangles on the roll that were so bad that they would stop feeding.  Once you used a third of the roll the tangling was less - but then the crumbly spots started.  Each roll had spots that were so dry and crumbly that the filament would break as it tried to feed.  You could just crumble it for a foot or two, it would break to bits when gently squeezed, it didn't feel like any normal filament - and then the filament would return to normal flexibility.  Someone told me that it was rumored to be mislabeled PLA and not ABS - a plastics expert told me to burn a little and if it smoked it was probably ABS while if it smelled sweet it was likely PLA, and it both smoked and smelled sweet.  It prints at ABS temperatures - warps and shrinks like ABS, and I got a couple great prints out of it.  I printed a T-Rex head and it didn't break during the print and looked great - then I couldn't print the mounting stick without warping.  I printed a twisted star vase using a vase slice, and it came out waterproof.  But I had prints fail because of crumbling and others failed because of tangling.  If I had to guess I would guess that it was a blend of plastics, maybe poorly sorted recycled plastic.  Not worth it unless you don't care that some prints fail.	-1
This filament does not come vacuum sealed, and the edge is left loose. This is by design according to Monoprice. Unfortunately, this makes for a tangled spool of filament that you must untangle before any printing can begin. After that point, you need to ensure the PLA hasn't swelled due to water absorption before printing. I would not recommend this filament, it is a hassle before you even load it.	-1
I'm disappointed in this filament.  Its properties aren't too bad, it melts at the expected temperature. and adheres to blue painters tape and a previous PLA layer reasonably well.  The color is slightly more transparent than natural PLA but not enough to justify the extra cost.  Where this filament disappoints is in the manufacture.  The thickness is remarkably inconsistent, it's very wavy instead of smooth, and it isn't wound on the spool very well.  As with most transparent PLA, it is very sensitive to moisture and needs to be sealed in a bag with desiccant when not in use.  Where the end has been scored by the extruder gear, it will always break the next day.  And the extruder gear seems to have a surprising amount of trouble holding on to the filament.  I can't use this filament in an unattended printer and I frequently need to restart prints because of this.  I won't buy this again.	-1
Please for the love of all that is holy DO NOT SERVE BEER FROM THESE LINES.  You get what you pay for. I paid double in terms of REMOVING this tubing after installing it with OETIKER CLAMPS. Tasted like a chemical factory mixed with a powerful skunk like sulfur aroma that is probably unhealthy at best. Please don't serve beer from these lines people...  ITS NOT WORTH ITTT	-1
I got a bad batch 100 out of 100 were creased poorly. Causing them to almost burst when taped up. Could not return them due to timing and orders.	-1
Usually the things that I get from SainSmart are 100% but this was not. Two main issues:  1) Does not include stepper motor driver jumpers -- even if you buy the set with the stepper motor driver boards!  Yes, these are cheap and easily purchasable but it can be quite disappointing if you think you are getting a complete set.  2) The heated bed MOSFET on mine was not wired correctly and burnt out the first time I tried to turn on my bed. I know that it wasn't my problem as I swapped it with a known good board and all was OK.  3) Making the issue worse is that the MOSFET for the heated board does not have a heatsink on it, like the real boards from Ultim*.	-1
These are very poor quality. Made out of a plastic/paper type of material, not cotton like they usually are. Would not buy again.	-1
These are trash. I tried getting several of them to work but was completely unsuccessful - would not recommend for anyone.	-1
First, these are "latex" color, NOT the "blue" nitrile shown on the box. Second, the box was open inside the package and since there was no plastic bag the box, I opened a Amazon package with 50 finger cots rolling around in the box ... so much for being clean. I'll be returning these.	-1
How about providing some meaningful instructions in the package?  Meter was generic and didn't have the Floureon name on it.  Only said made in china.	-1
I got this the other day. I already own 2 P3 International P4400 Kill-a-watt meters which are very similar in function. Here's why the TS836A is better: The display has three lines instead of one. more info at a time. Not well used though... The plug is lower on the unit and does not block the second outlet of a duplex outlet receptacle The unit remembers min and max power levels. The unit has an internal NiMH battery and keeps the accumulated time and KWH and min/max Power info in the event of power failure or just moving the unit. The unit enables cost per KWH entry to calculate actual cost rather than just KWH Current is displayed xx.xxx vs. xx.xx for the P4400. One more decimal of resolution. Too bad the current reading is much worse accuracy than the P4400!  Here's why the Kill-a-watt P4400 is better: smaller size 2% error on current and watts vs 5% error on current and watts for the TS386A (spec was 3% for the TS386A so its out of spec) Display is easier to read, the segments of the numbers are bolder and much easier to read in dim light and off-angle. esp. when the unit is wall mounted down low. Individual buttons chose one or two functions only - easier to chose. The line frequency is displayed with xx.x digits vs. just xx (no decimal) for the TS386A Better frequency resolution is nice if you are using a generator for example.  Ultimately it is a little harder on the TS836A to find the info you want due to the function button having so many functions. The units that show what the numbers are is very small and hard to read. On the P4400 I can just push the button for the function I want and I know what units the number displayed is in.  Picture shows accurately the contrast difference in the displays. (picture here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GZM7RIYIITWK/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009MDBU) Instructions with the TS836A are a little hard to understand. I don't have the P4400 instructions at hand but I don't recall having such a hard time with them.  Final opinion: I think I like the Kill-a-watt a little better.  P.S. 9 months later, The display is dimmed out and all but unreadable. Definitely a loser now. P4400s all still working and much older. Changing my rating to one star! PPS Its readable but only at a very small viewing angle from straight on which means you can never read it when plugged into a fixed wall socket like its intended. And by the way, it doesn't have VA (reactive power)  and Power factor of the P4400. something I miss.	-1
The simple fact that this product does not have a back light makes it pretty much useless. You can not view the screen from above it, you must look straight at it and the room must be VERY well light. Forget about this purchase, just don't buy it.	-1
Not Happy. Constantly shuts off just as I am about to take a reading. Constantly wasting time to stop testing, get to it, re-enter the settings then put it in place again. Very bad feature.	-1
Didn't operate out of the package, being sent back - in dead quiet room with NO sound at all this registered 50dBL.	-1
Can really ONLY be used OUTSIDE, in very well-ventilated areas, like OUTSIDE. I will have to use a dust mask, goggles and disposable gloves, and a scarf, so the product doesn't get on me or inhaled...They neglect to say this in their TV commercials, where they show people spraying the stuff without using any gloves or masks. AND it must be stored in a cool, dry place, so watch out if it's hot outside, so you can bring it inside...IF you have air-conditioned space to store it. Keep this far from tings in basements like furnaces, washers and driers, and other motorized appliances. Do not use near ANY flammable or hot objects. ALSO, it STINKS to high heaven, and the stench lasts for days..BUT WORST OF ALL, it DOESN'T WORK!!!! Nothing was "sealed," and I still have the same leaking thing I tried to seal with this JUNK. The vinyl siding crack is still wide open, even though it was a hairline crack. This is JUNK. FALSE advertising would be too kind to describe this stinking spray which sticks the gloves together...thank goodness I thought to WEAR gloves, as this was NOT shown in their false advertising. TERRIBLE!!!! AND NOW my eye is irritated constantly, as they did not say wear goggles, so some must have gotten into my eye and now I need to consult a doctor, as gunk and tears keep coming out of my eyes...TERRIBLE STUFF. DO NOT BUY THIS. The "seal" was not tight and the "clear" shows up looking like spit! Seriously!!!! If my eye dioesn't feel better soon, I migh just sue this company! DO NOT BUY THIS STUFF!!!!!!	-1
Two of these bearings scored the rods I had them on.  One of them had ball bearings fall out of it when I inserted the rod.  I am using them on a 3d printer, and although they get the job done, I don't think they move smoothly enough.  I won't buy them again.	-1
It's oily. Good luck using this stuff in brewing type things otherwise I guess a rat or varmint would like it ,but I did not buy it for them .. Try a hillbilly website -- soft & no oil -- you'll love it . They have there act together -- I always go there 1st.	-1
These people are worse than useless! I received my order of 100% Pure Copper Mesh today. Upon opening the package I found the product to be heavily oxidized; far beyond any reasonable reclamation. It's so dark I don't think anything will clean it without further contaminating it. If I had known the poor quality I was to receive I would have taken the time and effort to source the mesh locally.	-1
Absolute garbage don't waste your money ive been ordering alot of different bearing from amazon and these are the worst ive come across if you're planning on putting any thoughts on these they will not work and I mean any pressure at all	-1
Well i will start by saying that for the price, i got what i paid for. The bottom of the bowl has a few cracks/chips.  Not that it broke but it looks like it shrunk while it was being fired. The bowl and mortar is a bit porous, should be ok for some chemicals but not good at all for avoiding contamination. It might be a case of having one set per chemical. I would hope the quality control on these would improve, if it does i can see ordering more but as it stands, no i wouldnt recommend them.	-1
Two of these had slightly crooked bases. So it's obvious that the meniscus won't settle squarely parallel to the gradation on the tube. Not for serious measurement. And too cheap to bother sending back.  Two instead of one star because one of the three is modestly useful. Here again, the small cylinder is straight, but the gradation are inaccurate enough to make it useless for sensitive measurement.  Not intended for, or in any way useful for stoichiometric measurements.	-1
We bought this many times before, Never has the roll been smaller. All three rolls were different in length. Although we did not actually measure the length, The diameter was very noticeable. We even compared it to other unused rolls, Two were very noticeably smaller in diameter. This is not acceptable.	-1
It doesn't match the specs.  Bad customer service too.	-1
they are not that sharp....they break very easy.	-1
Worst ever seen or tried to use.  The blade is so tiny and so dull it could never be safe to use.  Perhaps if it had been sharp it could be called a craft knife for limited uses.  High potential to injuring yourself trying to hack through something.  Not worth it, just get a really sharp knife that is safe to use.	-1
I bought one of these at Costco and quickly returned it after realizing BS the specs were. The 6.0HP spec is pure baloney. Here comes my engineering take on it: One Horsepower equals 746 watts. Your typical 15A circuit breaker on a 120V line can output a max of 1800 Watts (120V*15A) before breaking the circuit. This thing claims 6HP, which would be 4475 Watts of power! That's crazy! You would need a 20A 240V line to power a 6HP motor. That's just science. I get that it claims 6 HP "peak", but that's still pure wishful thinking and very misleading advertising.  Given that they couldn't even be honest about the power, let me give you the real specs of it. It uses 11.5A during operation. This means it is really a 1.9HP motor. (120V*11.5A=1380W, 1380W/746(W/HP)=1.849HP). I'm not sure why the feel the need to give blatantly false specs like this, but if that's what they are going to do, I cant trust them to make a safe, reliable product. Who knows where else they were dishonest - the enamel coating on the magnet wire in the motor? The grade of plastic used for the injection molded parts? Maybe the stainless is just cheap Chinese pot metal. Who knows.	-1
looks good, sounds good, but clogs very quickly with dust.  got two uses out of the inlet bag before it stopped up completely.  has an inner filter which clogs quickly as well.  still use it for picking up water, works ok for that.	-1
Ok but does not Have the larger ones I needed.	-1
I would recommend this kit to anyone who is thinking about buying a 3D printer.  You can purchase a volume upgrade and make this printer print 8.5"x4"x6.5".  The volume upgrade is being discontinued soon, so make sure you get it ASAP.  It took me 5.5 hours to put it together and 6 more hours to calibrate the printer properly.  There is a support forum what you can use to get answers relatively quick 24-48 hours on average.  4"x4"x4" printing area limits the size of the things you can print, so volume upgrade is well worth it.  I printed colse to 50 objects with 1/2 pound of included PLA, so I recommend getting more PLA right away.  Changed from 5 stars to one star: my printer power supply failed 10 days after the printer was ordered.  I was able to find a replacement online, because my printer was out of 30 day support window - had to wait for a week to get it, and submitted my request for the first time after two weeks of owning the printer.  Printrbot support is very bad - takes 5-10 days to hear back and my request for a power supply was denied.  I bought a second kit and power supply for that printer failed during the first print.  Printrbot.com support states that you need to return the entire kit to get a replacement power supply.  Interesting piece of technology, but it does not work properly and is not reliable.	-1
Used to repair a plastic container that had a crack used to store plastic bags.  This stuff would not stick well to the plastic container.  Thought this being clear would look better but better off with duct tape.	-1
I'M NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS TAPE. I USED IT TO TAPE DOWN ANOTHER TAPE AND IT CAME RIGHT UP. WHERE IS THE GORILLA; HE DIDN'T COME WITH THIS TAPE SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED--NOT THE GREAT TAPE IT SEEMS TO THINK IT IS.	-1
I bought this to fix some small holes in my car seat. This tape is so incredibly reflective that your repair sticks out like a sore thumb. I am going to remove it, try to find something that will improve the look, not make it look worse.	-1
Not as sticky as I'd expect according to the reviews.  Perhaps this is old product and has lost some of it's stickiness? Not sure. I suspect a lot of products on Amazon are old stock from companies.  Does not work as reported on vinyl. Tried to seal a few blow up mattresses with bad results. Tape would not hold. Tried cleaning and decreasing with 91% alcohol and other products just to have the tape peel off or just plain leak.  Also tried heating with hair dryer with no better results.	-1
There was not much to this Gorilla Clear tape. It was not in any kind of holder and kept sticking to itself. My Scotch tape is better!	-1
Three Shark Vacs in three years, all have failed. Twitter at Shark will not allow you to leave any negative remarks, this is proof they are falsifying.their reviews.	-1
I really like a clean floor and have a lot of experience with different vacuums.  The Shark Rocket Ultralight vacuum let me down.  The motor is on the top portion and is heavy; feels heavier than 7.5 pounds.  I had to keep switching hands as it got too heavy.  It can't be stood up in a closet.  It can be hung on the wall or taken partly apart to stand up in a small way; weird.  The good thing is the suction is very good.  Overall, I do not recommend and think this vacuum needs a major re-design, not to mention overpriced.	-1
IT DOES NOT ALIGN THE AREA PERFECTLY.	-1
The VT02 has very low resolution on the thermal layer compared to other low end thermal imagers (e.g. Flir I3). No surprise Fluke does not disclose the resolution as it does with its other imagers (an educated guess suggests 16x16, but there is not confirmation from the company). If you consider to buy this product, make sure to watch this eevblog video first http://youtu.be/eHRyQtqg2SE  Edit (June 2014): I ended up getting a FLIR E4 about 6 months ago and am very happy with it. Make sure to check that ginormous thread on eevblog forums with excellent information about the E4.  I implemented a few of the mods suggested there (some may be software version specific) and now having even better image quality and a 3D printed tool to focus a few inches away, inspecting PCB's.  Edit (October 2014): Flir came out with their TG165 which has a low end thermal camera and an IR thermometer and is in the price range of the VT02. You can see it starting at  the 1 minute mark in this video http://youtu.be/oJbgcbedHhI including direct comparison with VT02. The VT02 is clearly inferior.  (I have no connection to Flir, Fluke or to the thermal imaging industry in general, I am just a user).	-1
Just not good. Thin. Cheap. Smells funny.	-1
The picture of this product is very misleading.  The heat shrink on the far left appears to be a large size. It's actually not large at all the pieces on the right-hand side are just extremely small  Additionally the heat shrink appears to be of mediocre to poor quality.  Go ahead and spend some money and get the 3M brand	-1
It only shrinks 2 to 1 so unless you can find a piece almost exactly the size to fit over the wires, it won't shrink enough to be practicable.	-1
The tape itself was fine and good quality... the stupid spool this came in basically unravelled the moment I took it out of the bag.  The stuff is a pain to store when not properly rolled and it was nearly impossible to re-roll it...so basically I got 55yds, used maybe 1 yd, and now have about 15 yd left in the roll...the rest is in a tangled mess I just threw out.  This needs side walls on the spool when it is this thing to prevent the spool itself from collapsing like this. ugh. Alternatively, I've had copper tape before of a similar width that was more self-adhesive which allowed it to maintain a roll-like form without losing it.  I'm not sure what was different, other than the good roll seemed a bit waxier/stickier, but I'm guessing this is why it stayed rolled.	-1
Opened the package and the center fell out of the tape, just fell apart everywhere. Now its a pain to work with. Poor quality.	-1
I bought this to wax french windows and doors and it turned out to be completely useless. I thought it would do a good job of getting into all the little crevices, but it just threw bits of wax all over. I ended up using a tooth brush (as I'd done on all the others) and a lot of elbow grease.	-1
It heats up very well up to 120 degrees in less than 10 minutes, however, the coating on the outside is very thin and slightly clamping it to your printer may cause the paint to rub off exposing the copper traces.  Depending on your design, this may cause your 12V or 24V to run through your entire printer and burn out some of your electronics.  It melted my USB cables, my USB port on my Macbook Pro and and fried the communication chips on 3 of my RUMBA boards before I found out where the short was coming from.  Based on the damage this product has caused me I wouldn't recommend anyone buy it.  If you do buy this, however, I would highly recommend isolating it wholly with Kapton tape.  I would recommend an alternate supplier for this board but make sure that the resistance for 12V is between 1.0-1.5Ohms MAX.	-1
already started to wear after only a month, belt is not rubbing anywhere.	-1
I was expecting what I saw in the picture... nope.  And the amount in the photo is more like 100 grams than 20 grams.  I tried it in my hands for a couple minutes... nothing happened.  I hope my daughter can make it work.  Not impressed with it yet.	-1
I'm a little disappointed because nowhere on the Amazon website does it say this device does not work with off-the-air TV transmissions. All I get is pulsating noise. I had to search other reviews and finally found a few from folks who had the same issue as me. My LG TV only has digital audio out with no settings so this device will only work when using an HDMI input. I bought it so I could use my headphones while watching the local news. Unfortunately I am unable to do that with this device.  There is a red label on the box on the bottom about changing the TV audio mode but my TV does not have that capability. If I had seen this warning on the Amazon website, I might have purchased a different device.	-1
Introduces a delay of nearly half a second. Worthless for my purpose.	-1
Save your money.	-1
Ordered this January of this year. Thought I needed to replace my 5yr old Dyson. When I got it, it performed just as well as the Dyson. I kept it because of the attachements. ( I had lost a couple of my Dyson's ) Less than a year later, it has lost suction and I can tell the carpets are not as clean. I don't have any pets and it is just myself and my young son. So, or carpets are not that challenging. Really wish I could return this.	-1
I purchased this 6 months ago but just got around to working on the project.  With a 45dcv input and 400 ohm dummy load the output was essentially zero.  With a scope I could see the output pulsing at about 20mv but the pulse frequency didn't change with adjustments to the potentiometer.  After a couple of  minutes the larger of the two capacitors became noticeably warm.  Because of the large number of positive reviews, I suspect this is a defective unit.  Since I'm well past the Amazon return period, I may roll the dice and purchase another.	-1
Has air bubbles in it. Prints look terrible.	-1
Poor quality don't buy contacted them for help they never did anything to help They even closed my case this item will cost you money to use manufacture will not help do not buy you will only have misery with no help don't buy	-1
Very low quality.  I have used hatckbox abs white and had no problems.  This stuff warps like crazy for some reason.  It is unusable...	-1
The Geatex GXT60 Dual Laser thermometer gun is a nice looking thermometer. It has a nice weight to it and is a nice size. It did not feel like a toy. I read other reviews complaining about the battery compartment and screw. They must have redesigned it or they were referring to a different model. The GXT60 battery compartment just has the front of the handle that swing down and you snap on the included 9 volt battery after you remove the plastic wrap off the battery and swing it back up to close it.  It has all the features that I wanted, high alarm, low alarm, max temp, min temp, avg. temp, differential, adjustable EMS, data hold temp, laser on/off, backlight on/off, dual lasers and a pouch. But the main thing I wanted it didn't have and that was an accurate temperature readings. It was 5-10 degrees off. I tested it against another IR gun, home thermostat and an instant read thermometer. All three of the instruments were 1/2 degrees different from each other but the Geatex GXT 60 was at least 5 degrees lower from all three. What good is a thermometer if it can't give accurate readings? If it was maybe 1-2 degrees off I can maybe tolerate it but 5 degrees, no that won't do. I might have received a defective one but I'm not going to exchange it. I received it today and I'm sending it back tomorrow to Amazon for a full refund.	-1
Will not stick to metal bicycle parts!	-1
The holes are NOT a 1/4" they are about a 64th smaller which means a 1/4" bolt will NOT fit. I drilled all 96 holes with a 1/4" bit. The wheel isn't 2". The holes aren't even remotely equally spaced or spaced the same between each wheel. There isn't enough space between the hole and the raised rim for the bearings to fit the head of any attaching hardware. Once weight is apply the casters drag on the hardware. I installed 12 then bought a different type and will be installing 24 different casters.	-1
Decent caster, but brittle. I had 4 break without a lot of weight on them. They were in a trailer and bounced a bit and the wheels broke in half.	-1

It works, but in my garage that was 45 degrees F, the screen would not show the temperature.  I had to place a heater near the thermometer in order to show the temperature on the screen!	-1
This is the worst filament I have ever used, do not buy	-1
I am very disappointed with this filament. Generally I consider Gizmo Dorks filament the best I have ever used. Sadly this black PLA is almost the most horrible filament I have ever used. The biggest problem is that the filament seems to have globs in some places which makes the diameter much larger than it should be and other places it looks like it was stretched too thin. This material jams in both my UP! Mini and Prusa i3. In order to use it I have to cut away uneven sections. I cannot use it at all for long prints.	-1
While other filament I've gotten from this supplier has been some of the best I've ever used, the black filament I received was exceptionally sub-par.  It looks like maybe there was some moisture in the extrusion for the spool I received or something.  The diameter of the filament varies drastically within just a few centimeters, and there are bulges in the filament that has made it so that I completely cannot use it with the printer that I have which uses a bowden tube.  I can barely use it in my printer bot and the prints don't come out very well because of the quality of the filament.  Hopefully my experience was an isolated one, but I'm certainly displeased with the level of quality control based on this specific order.  The only reason I'm likely to buy from this supplier again is that I've ordered their filament quite a few times before and been very happy with the product.	-1
came broken in pieces, but received new one at no charge and is o.k	-1
not impressed.	-1
Disappointing. Put in a sunlight window sill, it does not split light into rainbows a it should, at any angle. It's basically a triangular piece of glass; no visible light refraction at all.	-1
This cart was a complete disappointment. Handle is way to short and it walks up stairs like a pregnant duck. This does no better walking up steps than a big wheeled cart and turns way worse.	-1

Received this unit on Nov 27th. Very excited to be the first "kid" on the block with a 3D printer. Unboxing and setting it up felt like Christmas had come early.  I even bought the glass build plate - to avoid the reported issues with the acrylic plate being out of true. Printed out the Nut and Bolt test printable from the SD card. Worked great. Printed the stretchy bracelet - again worked great. Tried to print the little dinosaur and was good - right up until it got to the head and it looked like the poor little guy had an afro with severe bed head. Or was shot in the head. Take your pick. Printing got progressively worse from there. Several "air prints", multiple mid print failures, etc. after each failure I checked the build plate for level - it was.  I unloaded and reloaded filament multiple times. Eventually the extruder would not load the filament at all. It was completely occluded. I went online to Makerbot support and found that I had contact support for that issue with this replicator unit. Opened a support ticket on Nov 30 (Saturday). Did not get a response until Dec 5th (Thursday) . Granted there was a weekend in there but still I would expect something sooner than that for the amount of money laid out for this device. I also called and left voice mails on the support phone line asking for some kind of follow up. Twice. I finally got a response after sending a message via their facebook page. So I did some more basic trouble shooting under the guidance of support and turned out I need to have the bar assembly replaced. Makerbot support shipped me a replacement assembly which I received on Dec 7th. This is the process to replace: [...] This is not something that everyone would want to do. After replacing the bar assembly and getting ~5 minutes into a new stretchy bracelet I now get Heater Error #4 & Heater Error #5 messages displaying. The extruder refuses to get hot at this point and I can't unload the filament. I called support back this morning and explained where we were at.. They suggested I disassemble the unit (again) and send them the bar assembly AND the motherboard from the bottom of the unit. At this point I balked and said I'm not taking this apart again and removing even more components. I asked for a replacement unit to be shipped as I felt this one was defective and had done enough troubleshooting and repairs to warrant an exchange. They responded by saying that they don't have any inventory to do an exchange. They sent me a UPS shipping label via email to have me ship this unit back for them to repair it and ship it back to me. Expected turnaround time is 2 weeks (~12/23). Merry Christmas.  So at this point, I am extremely disappointed with the unit and support. It has promise, and when it does work it seems to be great. 2 Stars for now. I will post an update after I get my unit back.	-1
I already own two utility carts - both two shelf models - and I was hoping this three shelf model was going to be a welcome addition to my workshop.  Wow, was I wrong.  After briefly attempting to assemble this Luxor cart, and encountering what I thought was a poorly manufactured cart due to poor part quality and fit tolerances, I then went back and read some of the reviews to see if anyone else had the issues I did. I found one reviewer touched on the lack of sturdiness of the shelves and the build quality - but nobody touched on the fact that the leg posts do not fit into the shelf posts!!!  Huh?  Did they change the design of the parts recently?  DId I get a lemon?  How could I be one of the very few to encounter this?  First, a little about the two carts I already own - one is a WEN model, two shelf cart and one is a Husky cart, which is also a two shelf model.  These both were purchased from Home Depot - the WEN for $69 on sale (normally $99) and the Husky for $89.  The WEN cart looks exactly like the Harbor Freight $99 cart - and after further inspection I found out it is... although it is not a bad cart - I like it better than the HD Husky cart.  The main thing I do not like about the two Home Depot carts - only two swivel casters and NO locking casters - which is a pain in the rear on my sloped patio as I constantly battle the loaded cart toodling down the slope....  So you can see from the two carts I already own that my expectations were not through the roof - the two carts I own are sub-$100 carts, and I look for something that is built sturdy that does not carry a high price tag.  It is not like I was comparing this cart to $500 carts that are made of stainless steel - I weighing my inputs against two HD carts that I got for $69 and $89 respectively, and carts made of plastic.  Keep that in mind when reading here - this is NOT my first cart, and my expectations were NOT too high.  Also, this review is only my opinion, others may beg to differ, and I respect that.  Now, back to this Luxor cart.  Upon opening the box, the first thing that struck me was the "thinness" of the shelves.  Compared to the two other less expensive carts I own, the shelves are a lot thinner, and flexed with the slightest side pressure.  OK... I initially did not fret.  I was still looking forward to the fact I had four swivel casters, two that locked.  Well, I never got that far.  When I turned the first shelf over to install the posts, I was horrified first at the thin leg post material, and the cheapness of the plastic used.  They are square / channel designed legs, but made of VERY thin plastic, and very brittle plastic in addition - in my opinion.  But that was not the worst part - what was the real head scratcher was THEY DID NOT FIT INTO THE SHELF posts. I played with three or four of the legs posts on three or four different shelf posts, to no avail.  To make the leg posts fit, I would have had to file down the shelf post part... or force them on with a mallet, which would damage the receiving part of the shelf, and gouge out the plastic.  I refused to do that 16 times for the 8 shelf posts!!!!  They should fit, and if there was a concern about them being too loose, they should have designed them with a screw, or nut and bolt system!! If I attempted to force the legs on, it would peel back pieces of the shelf post, and I did not want to go any further.  Note that this cart is designed with ZERO screws, bolts, nuts, etc.  NONE.  On one hand some might like that, but with this cart and the way it turned out, even if I did want to keep this cart, that was a minus.  Given the cheapness of the plastic used on the leg posts, there could be nothing but problems down the road.  The thinness of the leg posts, and the cheapness of the plastic simply does not add up to making a press fit design.  This cart is simply NOT made to last.  At this point, I have described enough to paint the picture of my thoughts on this cart.  I never went past Step 3 on assembly.  I will stick with carts that are designed with thicker / beefier / sturdier parts, and ones that employ screw, nut and bolt hardware to hold it together.  I cannot believe this cart was more expensive than the two I already own...  As a side note, when I went back to HomeDepot.com, I noticed a three shelf cart under the label "H Wilson" that was the EXACT same cart as this one - the picture was the exact stock picture, with the same specs.  HomeDepot wanted $129 for this same cart... so obviously this cart is made in one factory, then marketed by more than one brand / company with different labels.  Says a lot to me.  I know that most carts are mass produced these days, but I will stick with the ones that are better built for my needs.  The pictures, description and reviews fooled me on this cart - what I thought I was getting and what I got did not match in quality in the end.  I am shocked at all the positive reviews for this cart... but again everyone's needs are different, YMMV, and I respect your assessment of this cart could be different.  Please return that sentiment....  Thanks for reading.  EDIT:  I did not mention this in my review above, but I did return this cart, and labeled it as "defective" since I could not get the leg posts to mate with the shelf standards without damaging the part or doing some major filing / modification.  EDIT 2:::  After reading other reviews - some that say how easy this cart assembled - I have to assume that the company changed the design of the cart, as the one I received did not go together easy at all - not even close.  I am a woodworker, an engineer and work with my hands all the time.  What follows is not a review written by someone who rarely assembles things, quite the contrary.  But I had to write the review for the product I received, and call it honestly.  I know some may not like that, but it is what it is...  ... if the company has since addressed this design / assemble issue, then that is a good thing.  And if my review had anything thing to do with that, then that is also a good thing.  But if the reviews written before mine that state how easy this cart assembles are true, then the only conclusion I can come up with is a design change somewhere along the way.  END EDIT:::	-1
This was less accurate than a set; BestDealUSA A set of 100g Gram Chrome Calibration Weight for Digital Jewellery Scale. The set was better, boxed and just a better buy.  I would not buy this again.	-1
The remaining will more than likely be sent back, I installed about 12 feet of this and it all fell off over night.  What a joke this stuff is. Defective right out of the box.	-1
The adhesive does not adhere to support any amount of weight. I was using this to attach a section of lightweight curtain material that was only 17 inches in height. I found some foam VHB type tape at Homedepot and used it instead. Worked great.	-1
Good clean lead but way way over priced	-1
The colors on the color bands are difficult to make out, they are a little off col;or. Red is not quite red, green is not quite green, gray is not quiten gray, etc.  I have to use an ohmmeter to be sure of what I have.	-1
I didn't have any problems with the install or software (win8), but the single trigger feature of this oscilloscope turned out to be useless. It missed the whole signal about half of the time, and the other half, it flashed on the screen, then was immediately overwritten. The signal was a 3khz, 5v square wave with a 60ms duration. If this thing can't capture that then what is good for? Capturing one-time events is like.. 75% of what an oscilloscope is used for. I wish I handn't let this sit on the shelf for so long before trying it. Now I can't return it :(	-1
I can not download software from www.sainsmart.com and mini CD is not detected by my Dell Inspiron 1520 Win 8.1 X64 laptop.	-1
I never thought a Hakko product could be so low quality until i got this! I ordered also $7 set from a company called pixnor which way way above the quality of Hakko!	-1
Worked  for  10  miniutes then  does  not  Flash  anymore!!!!	-1
This is the third time I've rewritten this review. After trying to print some high quality prints, this filament is absolutely worthless. It is so inconsistent that if you try to print something with low infill or single perimeters, it simply will not hold up. This is such a waste, do not even waste your time buying this. Look at a more expensive filament, $5 or $10 more dollars will be worth it when you are printing high quality prints that do not fall apart. And as an added note, I have had some very nice prints with other filaments, so my printer is calibrated in and working perfectly normal.	-1
These probably would have been good shaft clamps however after one turn of the tightening screw, the thread on the clamp stripped out. The build quality just isn't that good.	-1
Feels good but the thing keeps falling apart.	-1
This was a fun surprise as I opened my package and there were 100 razor blades loose inside of it, some with their band on and some with their blade exposed.  The packaging needs work. I know these are cheap, but holy heck that's not good.	-1
These were not made of stainless steel, they were potmetal zinc. Garbage. Failed on my application miserably.  I tried to heat one to build a quick install device as I had a lot of them to spin on high on a ladder, and it melted like solder.	-1
did not fit in the hotend hole on the block.. not sure if these are the epcos or something else. first print with this i set for 180 it came out black burnt goo.	-1
they show temperature with using 11 but they are way off, I used them in 2 different printers and the temperatures were off, I had to heat to 220 to get PLA to print, checked it out, all 4 heads (2 dual head systems) were off by 50 degrees. No where did it say in the description that it is meant for marlin or a specific setting in marlin so cant really say it was false advertising but I bet if everyone that posted reviews checked their temps with a good thermometer they would find them off. Now that I have spent several days calibrating them i can finally get wood grain effects in my wood filament. see[...] for the settings that I found to work.	-1
The heads are carbide but the shanks are soft steel. The shank diameter is 3mm NOT 1/8" as advertised. The 3mm shank will not chuck up in a proper 1/8 die grinder. It may chuck up in a cheep electric dremel tool or equivalent but not an 1/8 air micro grinder or in an 1/8 collet for use in a 1/4" air grinder. When accelerated quickly the shanks bent 90 deg and my grinder shook violently. Save your money, there are eBay venders selling solid USA made carbide burs with correct 1/8" shanks for about $1.25 each in lots of 25 or 50.	-1
Just received this yesterday, the Mega 2560 board could not have been QC'ed. The  22-53 connector was soldered in at an angle which prevents the connection of the Ramp board. The only saving point was that I have access to a full hot air rework system and a skilled technician correct the problem. But until I am able to complete the build I will have no idea if any of this stuff will build. If you are looking to buy this, be prepared to do significant rework on at least the Mega 2560. Most reviews are favorable so my case may be a one off. The product is too cheap to waste money on a return.  Day three: Well two of the stepper motor boards are crap. In one case the board could not even turn the stepper motor with no load and before you ask, yes I did the setup described on the WIKI page, and adjusted the current once the stepper stalled. The other stepper motor board was hooked up to the extruder and would turn as long as I had no filament installed. Luckily after the what I saw of the Mega 2650 board I bought some backup stepper controllers  so I had one to replace the dud and I have enough to replace the extruder motor if I have time tomorrow. It's really looking like I didn't save any money by buying this one.	-1
Received defective curved forceps. One part where finger goes out of round and missing metal on top. Poor quality control	-1

I love kreg and their products, but this is just an overpriced piece of paper. There is nothing special about it and is massively overpriced.	-1
Informative information, but its basically carboard, overpriced!	-1
Battery compartment was only big enough to fit the battery, which left no room for the battery wire. As soon as I slide the battery in, it cuts the wire.	-1
you get what you pay for	-1
the temperature is never right, I used 5 different meters and never have the right temperature	-1
Other reviews do not square with my experience.  Regardless of temperature or print speed, my objects came out incredibly brittle and were easily crushed in my hands.  Very high temps were required for layer bonding.  I have a stock reference part that I use to evaluate filament density, strength and flexibility.  No other materials tested (various PLA, ABS, Nylon) were crushable at all.  Printed on Makerbot Replicator 2's at 230-270C from 30mm/s to 60mm/s.	-1
I purchased these knurled knobs mainly for the price. It seemed like all the other ones were much more expensive. I did not even pay attention to the "lock nut" in the description. I didn't even know they made these with nylon locking nuts. While I have used nylock nuts on quite a few items where I don't want the nut coming off,  (like on some kind of a pivoting joint) one of the main reasons for ordering knurled nuts to begin with is because they are tightened and removed frequently. A nylon bushing doesn't make sense here, and to me is just a bad design. Not sure what they were thinking.  I just took 0.25 x 20 tap that I happen to have, and got rid of the nylon, but it takes a while, and something I did not anticipate having to do. I like the knobs well enough that I'm not going to bother to send them back, but I think the manufacturers should reconsider the locking part. It's really inappropriate for knurled knobs.	-1
Dreadful experience. How could they manufacture these that can't fit regular 1/4-20 bolts of other makes. Tried several other T-bolts that were meant to fit with these knobs but none could. Not of any use if they won't fit. Had a refund from Amazon.	-1
Tap is completely defective, there is 0 lead angle on the threads (there is NO helix, see the attached picture) which basically turns this tap into a roughing end mill. I ended up destroying an expensive intake manifold trying to tap it. Upon closer examination each of the 4 lands is cut exactly the same, which instead of making 14 threads per inch, it would make 14 equally spaced grooves per inch.	-1
Although I loved this syringe for acrylic bonding projects at first, it went bad quickly. I can't recommend it to others.  This is seemed like a great syringe, but it lost three stars for me because after about a half dozen uses in the course of two weeks, the rubber plunger inside now frequently pulls off the sliding piece when you backdraw it. That's pretty annoying.  I was using it for Weld-on 4 application, which is what the title of the item said it was for when I bought it (in case it changed now). So it's not like I was using it for an unadvertised purpose.  Because this went bad in a very short timeframe but was great before that, it's a solid two stars in my book. I can't recommend it to others for use as an acrylic bonding solvent applicator.	-1
Not really good for solvent - tried using it with OMS and it seized up	-1
I was a nurse for over 25 years and know what small gloves should feel like and this didn't even come close they ripped quite quickly	-1
I used to think the price was OK and the gloves where fair, but this box has aged a few months and the breaks are horrible. They break going on. They break after a few seconds of use.  There are MUCH cheaper gloves out there that are LOTS thicker. Check my other reviews. Too late now to get a refund, and MedPride should be ASHAMED at the reliability of this glove.  Double glove at a minimum. Actually, they are thin enough to triple glove, but of course, you can buy a decent glove elsewhere at a cheaper prices. Try searching for 5 mil gloves.  If you stop in a medical office and see these gloves, you should be concerned.	-1
Does not fit my "standard size" peg board. The peg diameter is too thick. I purchased several other hooks from other companies w/o a problem.	-1
Flimsy pieces but they do fit my 1/4 inch hole pegboard well. I like the metal ones better but thought I would give these a try. Good for hanging very lite objects and won't see a lot of use.	-1
Cheap plastic. These accessories were part of a Christmas gift for my mechanic brother-in-law. We purchased the wall peg poard from this brand too. These accessories were so cheaply made we ended up having to to order the Stanley brand accessories kit. It luckliy arrived before Christmas because we would have been embarrassed to give just this set. Wish we had just ordered the other set to begin with, but luckily my brother-in-law liked the yellow buckets (he says the hooks are okay as far as hollow plastic goes!) The peg board from this brand is nice, but it did not include the accessories as stated. I suggest if you're buying that board that you save yourself the hassle and go with the Stanley accessories!	-1
This is some of the worst filament I have ever used, completely filled with air bubbles. DO NOT BUY this filament complete garbage.	-1
There was air in the filament.  I was having issues, so I decided to check for the quality of the filament and found air gaps in it! Thats why I gave it one star. I used to buy all my filament from gizmo dorks. but I have had issues with every roll. Maybe you'll have better luck.	-1
Cheap lights but only about half of them work right. The others flicker constantly when they are on.	-1
Well it seems to work but the power off button doesn't power it off so had to return.  Will probably get the BK Precision unit or one of the other quality ones.	-1
does not read a cap i wanted it for to test	-1
erratic behavior, returned.	-1
Wanted a reliable way to test capacitors and inductors. Singstek M4070 works great! It's far more accurate than my multimeter at measuring capacitance and I couldn't measure inductance at all before I got this meter.  The screen is well illuminated and the product is very solidly built. It is a bit toy like in appearance but don't let that fool you, this is a solid product. You turn it on and it just works. You can hear the relay clicking inside which feels sort of cool.  It's very easy to use. It also auto detects what you are testing, messages like "Small Inductor", or "Large Capacitor" appear above the measured value. It would be nice if it measured capacitor ESR, but at this price point you really can't ask for more.  I must say this LCR meter has exceeded my expectations. I give it thumbs up all the way!  EDIT: well I spoke too soon. I turned the meter on and it can no longer measure capacitance. Now I may have made a mistake as I still had the capacitor plugged into the meter from when I measured it before when I turned it on, but I wouldn't think that should damage the meter. The capacitor is brand new and was only ever unpacked to test with the meter, so there was never any other charge in it other than the one provided by the meter for testing (which should be safe.)  Anyways the meter now goes into this autorange cycle mode and it can't measure sub uF capacitance, as it keeps cycling.	-1
Ordered gray and received white.	-1
Leaves residue not lIke what they advertise.  Product had multiple mini Dimond  paterns imprinted on it on every layer  I hope this doesn't  affect  the long term integrity  this could be damage  from the shipping  or manufacturer I don't know. Utility duct tapes are only for temporary repairs, this is not  a utility duct tape its a  Gaffer long term repairs tape	-1
Tape works as advertised with one exception that caused me to rate the product low. When tearing the tape it tears on a 45 degree angle. If you want a straight cut you'll need to use scissors.	-1
After a month, it still curls up- the carpet its on does have a tight weave but the grips are unable to keep it from moving.	-1
Don't bother with xyz. All they do is scam you your money	-1
I ordered this after having success with the black PLA as well as the natural and black ABS. When I first opened the box to install it in the machine I immediately noticed it was clear not off white like the natural abs.  Then after the first few prints I had nothing but problems. This filament flaked off going through the extruder and eventually jammed the extruder. I have the updated extruder purchased from xyzprinting for PLA and it still jammed it several times.  Overall I do not recommend this PLA. Purchase a resetter and go with hatchbox. It's 40% cheaper and prints beautifully.	-1
This machine is meant to be a plug and play. It prints the demos flawlessly. That is the last good thing I will say about it. Problems: 1. Support options. There are two forms of support, phone and their web site. The only times I tried to use the phone support, I had to request it on their website and give them a time to call me back. The don't always call back. The second option is the most obnoxious. You first need to login to the support web page and generated a problem report. So far no different from anyone else. When you get a response you get an email telling you that they have responded to your problem. However, the response is not included in the email, instead you have to login into their website once again to read the response. These communication are not in a forum they are between me and the support person so why do I have to login to my email to read that I need to login into the support site  to read a private response! 2. The first response is always, update your software and firmware if necessary. The first time I contacted them  my problem was that the printer was printing badly and I tried to use the re-calibrate function  to reset the leveling only to get an obscure error code. and the support person's response was to update my software and firmware. Since I had to hang up from the call because it takes a while to do this. When I got the machine updated and was waiting for a second call-back, I found on the internet that the error-code could mean that the metal corner supports needed to be cleaned. 3. Wiring of the extruder and hot-end. Two times the wire from the controller to the hot-end shorted out. The first time it was because the wire to the connector was not properly installed so over time the constant motion of the print head cause the exposed wire ends going into the connector to touch. Of course due to they horrible support I just went ahead and repaired the connector. The second time, may have been my fault, but was because the wire to the hot-end rubbed against the metal frame holding the extruder and wore through the insulation. On the positive side, the controller appeared to detect the problem and prevented a fire by shutting the print down and displaying an obscure error message. Finally, the control wires to the extruder shorted and burned up. This was the last straw, I gave the piece of crap to an intern to get it out of my shop. I will never buy another Xyz product and will make sure that all my associates are aware of the poor quality and support.	-1
I ordered 3 cartridges, the first 1 worked fine. The second two will nor work in my machine, i get the following message, even though they are authorized XYZ cartridges and the machine is able to read the material quantity.  "cartridge cannot be recognized" Unable to identify the cartridge installed, printing parameters will not be changed. Please replace a genuine XYZprinting cartridge and try again.  Now i am beyond the return window and am stuck with 2 defective cartridges.	-1
This 3D printer only recived 1star because only after recieving the printer will the consumer know that you are stuck with buying filament from XYZ at $28 for a 1lb roll of PLA. Way over priced. They have chipped the filament cartridge to only work with new chips. Also you can only use there slicing software. Therr is ways around both as i have done with mine. It now accepts any filament i want to use and any slicing program i want to use. XYZWARE uses your internet to keep tabs on the printer. If i was you i would block the printers access to the internet unless you reflash the motherboard firmware. The hardware is really not bad the extruder can run PLA but needs some moding to do so. Or again you can switch to a better extruder E3dv6 is a great hotend. This printer could have been the number one printer of 2014 but of course they had to be greedy and lock the system to only use there filament and software.	-1
The spool is wound so tight, the printer can not continue to pull the material out of the cartridge.  It's takes a good hard pull to get some material out by hand.  I don't mind the cartridge idea, but they have got to get this issue fixed. I have 3 cartridges and 2 (Natural color and this yellow one) have this problem.	-1
The price has been beaten to death and is not likely to change. Being a single source critical component of the Xyz Printing Da Vinci is not likely to change. My complaint is that this is the second cartridge I have received that has jammed while printing. I have purchased 4 cartridges from XYZPrinting so that means I have a 50% failure rate with these cartridges. On the Green one I purchased the cartridge would jam, but with a little forceful tug on the filament I could make it feed again, so not a total loss. However on this cartridge, the filament is jammed tight. What really burns me up, is that they tend to jam in the middle of a large print job which results in a significant waste of filament so the cost per print becomes much higher than the nearly 200% based on price alone. Shame on XYZPrinting for first forcing us to  use their cartridges, charging a premium price, and delivering a substandard product. The printer itself is a beautiful design even though the software can be wonky at times. But these cartridges are nearly criminal.	-1
The printer worked fine for the first few months. The software must have gotten better since the last round of bad reviews. It's nothing amazing and it does fail to slice some stuff off thingiverse, but it usually does a reasonable job. The accuracy seemed pretty good and we enjoyed the parts it made for us.  However, after only 60 hours of printing (that's 20 or so parts on average), the heater in the head stopped working. It's still under warranty, but the company won't even give us the time of day. It's a brick now - or I'l have to void the warranty (which they don't support) to fix it, I guess.  The negative to the software is that if it detects an internet connection, it will automatically download and install the firmware without asking. That's frustrating, since I don't want to be the first adopter in the case of bad firmware (which the company has a reputation of having). They also apparently upload a log of everything you're printing and track your usage. That's creepy. Searching forums about issues, it sounds like they will also remotely disable your printer if you try to use 3rd party filament (by tracking serial numbers) OR EVEN IF SOMEONE ELSE USES 3RD PARTY FILAMENT AND USES YOUR CARTRIDGE NUMBER... That's crazy.  My single biggest fear is that apparently the printer will disable itself if it does get updates via the internet via your computer from the company. If they keep with the bad practices and go out of business... what will happen to all of us when the updates stop coming?  If you do happen to buy it... Just a few tips. Calibrate often. It looses calibration on shipping and periodically. That seems to make the prints come out well. Also, rafts do a TON of good. They help make it so the parts don't curl up when the plastic cools and also gives a good gripping surface when printing. Almost never misprinted if a raft was down.  Update: A month or so later - we've sent the company multiple emails and called them to ask for support on this machine. The company has not once answered their customer service line and are not returning phone calls. They also never respond to emails on any of their public email addressed. Concerning.  Update 5/2015: I've tried over and over to get a hold of someone at the company (Around 3 months of attempts now). I've had to seat and reseat the heating element connectors every few prints - and have had a bunch of prints fail. I've been trying to do only things that would respect the warranty, but this last time, the connector broke apart. Upon inspection, it became obvious that the connector actually melted. Finally, I had to cut the wires and install a better connector. Since the warranty is now void (which was useless anyway, apparently), I'm done buying their filament - from now on, 3rd party is the way to go. No reason to support the company anymore.  The hardware is still decent - sure, some small issues, but they don't support their devices to help get minor problems fixed. Somehow they managed to make an okay printer - but the company really is terrible.	-1
Several spools I own have jammed.  Some when it is brand new because the filament got fouled in shipping.  Some were my fault - until I realized my error was pushing the filament back into the cartridge can also cause trouble.  The issue is the same either way, a loop of filament slips off the spool and tightens around the axle causing it jam. Many of the holes where the filament leaves the cartridge are too small and this also causes issues.  I opened it up and fixed all problems- but why should I and they make it hard to do so.  The cartridge is opaque so you cant see in it to see if there is a snag or to see how much filament you have left. Bad design.  I will also note- a spool I got had been clearly been broken open- which may mean they shipped me a refurbished spool - at full price.  And it was snagged... so they didn't even refurb it well.	-1
Pros:  Looks well built.  Printed a few parts before breaking down (one week into ownership)   Parts that were built looked acceptable for the price of the machine   Set up and manual are easy to understand. Cons:  Critical moving parst are not lubricated  (screw axis positioners)   Failure of extruder connector was immediate and after finally getting someone at Customer Service to respond to me I had several people agree it was a known problem, but they are having a problem getting replacement parts (I am several weeks into communicating back and forth with no luck - I will update review if this gets some positive  attention.   Bed leveling is very difficult.  Built in firmware has many problems.  For leveling, there are hints in other reviews on Amazon that makes it somewhat easier to get the bed closer to level.  So printing parts is hit and miss.  Some come out.  Some are a mess.   Having to buy and use their "cartridge" filament is expensive and limiting.  Some cartridges "jam" (filament, like thread naturally crosses itself jamming).  Because it is enclosed in a case one has to break the case apart and there are differing results (because of a chip in the case) as to whether you will harm the transport mechanism or even the whole machine if you try and fix it per their website instructions.  Very risky.  Customer service (as noted in earlier reviews) much of  the time do not answer their phone during business hours.  When communicating over their messaging system they do not follow up with what they say they will do.  I do not recommend this machine to potential buyers even when they take $100 off the price.  Update: Machine is still "down" / inoperable as of 2/14/2015.  Lots of back and forth with "customer care" who are having me take the machine apart and send in a part before helping me and not making any assurances as to how long a replacement part will take to get or even if they have them.  I will update as things progress.  Very bad processes.  Update:  2/20/2015  Machine sits idle.  Really bad customer service has a part of the machine in their hands and when I ask if they are going to send a warranty replacement part in their "message center" I am given a stock answer of "when the department involved decides you will be notified".  I will update if things change.  Update:  2/25/2015  Received replacement part.  Installed easily but caused more problems than I had before.  Calling the customer service number is still a joke as you get "call back during our hours"  which I and others always call during.  (poor English because I am fuzzy after working 9 hours today on this machine).  I finally got a nice man to call me and spend much time on the phone.  We improved on the filament feed problem but he said one of the sensors may not really be sensing that the filament is there and only after trying to make parts would we know more.  Bed calibration was out (again) so several hours of re calibrating.  Finally able to make a few parts but they were horrible looking.  There are so many bugs and idiosyncrasies neither myself (an Engineer with 40 years experience) OR the nice XZY tech could say anything for sure.  Feeling like a boxer who has taken a beating I am throwing in the towel.  I will still try to get the XYZ to do something but I placed an order today for Lutzbot Mini from Amazon.  Everywhere I researched the reviews were glowing.  Even though I am past Amazon's return policy, I would be grateful if they would take back the xyz printer as it only worked for the first two weeks I had it.  (sometimes)  Even if they only gave me a store credit I would be an appreciative customer.  For now it may become a coffee table.  Please read my review carefully if you have ANY idea about buying an XYZ 3d printer product.  Many, Many hours working on it trying to get it to work and many hours trying to get reasonable responses from their online "customer service" message center which most of the time just says "forwarded to appropriate department".  Read the other one star reviews for very specific nightmares.  Update (final):  I logged 10 hours yesterday trying to get this machine to work with a part they sent me causing more problems.  Some time on the phone with a nice tech who seemed a bit baffled by the many problems.  I even sent them a photo of the messy part I finally got it to print. Their response was to refer me to the "helpline" which does not work. So late last night I pledged that it was my last 10 hours (I have many hours into this mess of a machine and company).  I will write off the $400+ my wife spent on this present.  Late last night I gave the machine to a man who is anxious to build his own from parts that can be scavenged from this nearly new machine.  I again, would, like others have urged, request Amazon to drop it's affiliation with these people.  I post below my FINAL response to them on the "ticket" in their system which in total prints out at 21 pages.  My final post is a bit long, but I hope it makes it to this review for you to observe:  "First off let me express my amazement at how bad a company can handle their business.  And that is significant given that I see a lot of bad moves in the political arena as a Registered Legislative Lobbyist.  But even today, I was somewhat shocked at one of your postings to me on this message link telling me to call the customer help number which is now becoming famous on review boards with its incredibly offensive "call back during our business hours" recording that plays no matter when one calls.  And to top it off, another voice tells you to leave a message and press star which gets you nowhere to another message saying something to the effect of "that mailbox does not exist".  Do you really not get how many people you make IRATE with that, and all your other "we forward to appropriate department" AND "our policy is...." nonsense?  And this behavior dates back to sometime last year.  It appears you HAVE NO WILL TO IMPROVE.  One tech I talked to after my first 10+ hours of trying to work the bugs out--- answered my challenge of how bad the processes and top management were with XYZ  -- answered me with what I know is an honest "You don't know the half of it."  Exact quote.  Your own people know XYZ is a mess. Take some time COMPANY EXECUTIVES to just read the one star reviews on Amazon (there are tons of them).  Get a feel for how angry and frustrated you make customers when they need you.  The five star people will learn when their units fail.  This machine is so full of problems it is amazing. XYZ is so full of process problems it is amazing.  The business decision not to tell us that a connector is faulty until we have dozens of hours trying to figure out why the extruder doesn't heat is despicable.  I have made a list of other defects that you hide and we finally find out from one of your techs (which are almost impossible to get to) OR from good people who post YouTube information on your problems and possible workarounds.  For me, yesterday was my last "10 hour workday" trying to make this thing work.  I appreciated the few good parts I got for the first week.  After connectors fail, bed cannot be calibrated with the present design, and a myriad of other very bad flaws  --  I unplug the machine and will write off the $400+ my wife spent in good faith buying this as a present that worked for a week or so.  I will pursue other avenues.  As I stated in an earlier message here:  "I give up."  I do process consulting with companies (I don't wish to take on yours), but I mention that only because I do wish you to experience some kind of epiphany, or self-realization, that SHOCKS you into a dramatic program of quality improvement that (LEAN business practices, Total Quality Control,  Listening to your front line people who know where your messes are) would lead to reverse your course of shoving new products into the marketplace without proper business support processes.  Good Luck.  Goodbye.  Rod"  END OF CONTACT WITH XYZ	-1
The printer is Ok for fun! The customer service is great. But other than that, useless. 1. The quality of the printing is terrible ( compared to Printbot Simple metal-same price) 2. The freedom around setting up the extruder and filament are extremely limited. That is a huge down side.( Compared to Print Bot) 3. Software opportunities are also very limited( If you need an extra support for the printing  - sorry, change the printer) Don't get me wrong, I'm just being critical for the better doing of XYZprinting.	-1
So this is a great printer when I was working. Great prints for the money nice look and easy to use. After about 5 days the glass on printing bed just cracked buy xyz said they send me a new one. Ok... but 2 days later now the heating elelement for the extruder now will not work. They said they send that too. So we will see how that works out. Just not happy it's brand new and all ready having problems. Customer service said i need to pay for shipping ship in the bad parts then wait for them to get them and then they will ship them out. This is only a week old!! Amazon is just going to replace the whole printer. If i didn't spend like $150 in filament and use it i would return it all and get my money back!! DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK IF YOU WANT A GOOD 3D PRINTER SPEND NO LITTLE THEN $1000. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR in this case CRAP!!!!	-1
Before you read further, let me warn you.  XYZ uses garbage heating elements.  The heating element in the extruder will go bad no matter which one you use, it's just a wearable component but the ones XYZ uses (and the replacements they send) do not last more then 2-3 days.  Normally you should get 6 months to a year out of this part, 2 years if you are not using this thing heavily.  So, tape an allen key to the side of your printer because you're going to be changing heating elements a lot!  XYZ's facebook page is pretty great.  They responded on facebook within minutes, providing tips and links to tutorials that others have found helpful.  The printer itself looks really professional.  It's the first "finished" looking 3d printer that I've seen that has a usable build area.  The 7.8" build area is massive compared to other printers triple the price of this one.  You're getting a printer that prints better models than the $1500 models and looks better as well!  It comes pre-calibrated but the novice user will still have to overcome a learning curve.  Shapes made in sketchup or similar software do not always transfer cleanly through the XYZ ware, so make sure you preview the post-slice rendering before you allow it to print.  My first few prints were disastrous but once I had a thin layer of dried glue and leftover plastic on the base, they got better.  I've had a lot more luck leaving the glass plate "dirty" than when it is perfectly clean and smooth.  The printer comes with a glue stick, you should apply a thin coat and let it dry before printing.  The plastic sticks to the glue instead of the glass and your models are a lot easier to remove.  You're only going to get 1 or 2 good prints though before you're sent spiraling into calibration hell...  Anyone who's printed 2-3 objects will know what I'm talking about - and if they deny this, they're lying.  The vibrations from the pieces moving on the printer will knock the heated bed out of alignment and you'll spend hours turning the tiny wheels and testing calibration to try and get it back.  I don't know of any printer that has automated this process yet - but when someone does... please let me know!!!  The software tends to butcher 3d models, even shapes that the printer seems very capable of printing.  Once you get the trick of how the software will treat your models you do alright though.  Make sure you preview what the model changes into after being "sliced" before you confirm the print.  The resolution is okay.  It's not great.  It took me a bit to figure out how to adjust this.  The XYZ software seems really outdated and it's not very intuitive.  Just like any other thermal 3d printer, everything you print is going to be covered in lines from the layering.  You can adjust the settings to make slightly thinner layers but you have to do this every time you print.  They claim 100 micron resolution - and I just don't see it.  The best I've gotten, even using higher quality plastic than xyz offers, is 200 microns.  With stronger software, this printer would be really awesome.  That being said, it is absolutely the best printer for the money.  It prints at the same quality as other printers for about half the cost... but I just don't honestly think the technology is there yet for proper "home use."  You CANNOT just plug this thing in and print.  You need to learn the quirks and adjustments and perform lots and lots of maintenance on this thing.  There simply is not a home-use-ready 3d printer out there yet.  They all take a while to get used to and they will all give you "birds nests" until you get the hang of them... which is disappointing because you shouldn't need an engineering degree to operate a device that functions on technology from the 1970s!	-1
It is a decent printer, not the best resolution, but for the money, it's a functional 3d printer.  It get's errors from time to time, but CS has been 'helpful' in fixing them.  I have found that 3rd party forums are a better source of info though.  The CS from XYZ is quite demanding in their info requests, ie 4-5 emails a day demanding serial numbers from various locations on the printer.  The filament cartridges are a joke though.  They are proprietary and of poor quality.  There was a common practice of resetting the cartridges using a resetter, but now the latest firmware update prevents this.  It remotely reports back to XYZ what you have been printing and if they detect you are using a reset cartridge, they remotely disable your printer.  That's right, they intentionally brick your printer.  Can anyone say class action?	-1
Save your money for something more high end. I constantly have to recalibrate my bed, and even if I make no changes, they calibration will show a different number EVERY SINGLE TIME.  Also, even if the calibration is a "success" the extrude will hit the bed when it is cleaning, or sometimes make a grinding sound across the bed as it is printing, and I will have to start over.  The prints come out pretty sloppy as well. Could it be that I got a bad unit?  I regret not saving my money for a Makerbot.  My only hope that the future firmware and software updates will make my prints come out better... And I also hope that it is something as simple as a bad sensor making my calibration so difficult.	-1
I am changing my review---- I will leave the first one below to show my initial response.  After use the heat sensor broke-  It might be as simple as a broken wire.  To my great surprise I was told the heating head was only under warranty for 90 days.  So the most used- most likely part to break has a VERY short warranty.  Not good.  If anything will break first on a machine it is the head and the don't support it.  I have $489 dollars worth of machine that won't work because they won't replace a $10 part. I was fan and supported them and get nothing in return.  It never worked great but FOR THE PRICE it was good enough.  But now it won't work and I'm out.  1st review below before breaking:------------------------------- Amazing!!!!!- but not for everyone. I've compared this against $15,000, $1;600, and $800 FDM printers.  For the price, it is unbelievable and has quality equal to the lesser cost ones and 70% of the most expensive machine. Note the qualification: "For the price". Because this is the first version it is not perfect.  I had to return 1 of these that arrived with issues and fixed the 2nd.  It had bad shipping issues, and without my help would not have worked.  The software has lots of  issues.  The filament has a chip so you must buy theirs, but it is cheap. So to be clear- it has messed up a lot of parts and arrive broken twice.  So why the 5 stars?  Because it makes great parts for 1/30th the price of my other machine. Any 3d printer below $3000 will need similar attention as this one.  I know you don't have to fix a hairdryer you buy from Amazon- but 3D printers are changing daily and that's a reality you should accept or avoid the for now.  IT IS THE FUTURE- but its not perfect yet-  If you have never touched a 3D printer - Wait - till the 2nd or 3rd version.  They need to work out basic design and manufacturing issues.  If you want to play with the future for $500- buy one of these.  XYZ was very responsive to all above issues, and has worked with me readily.  They know there are issues and want to help.	-1
I've had this printer about 6 months.  I've been through a lot with it, and I originally reviewed it a few months ago with a favorable impression - that this is a good hobby machine as long as you're willing to put in work, learn the machine, and customize it.  Now I can't recommend it.  The company (XYZPrinting) has been taking active steps with their firmware and software to block people from using 3rd party filament - honestly, one of the only things that got this printer a decent following in the first place.  Given that this is the attitude of the company, I can't recommend this printer anymore.  It's built crappily and I've already had to fix several things with it, or add modifications to get decent functionality.  And since XYZ wants to discourage that, I'd say there's very little future with this machine.  The print quality is poor, and the Z layers ripple due to what would seem to be hardware problems that can't be fixed in software (looks like the problems you get when you use a standard Z drive screw instead of a metric).	-1
I would give it zero stars, but unfortunately there is a one star minimum rating.  I'll keep it short and sweet.  I received the printer last week, and since then, it has not been able to successfully print anything other that the 3 demos it has.  Every time it messes up any other model I try to print, either created by me or downloaded from somewhere else.  Does not matter which setting I use to print, it always ends up screwing the print up.  I contacted XYZ Support, and they told me to clean, calibrate, wait to apply the glue before printing, etc...  None of their expert advise has worked so far.  In the meantime, I keep wasting filament. I took some pictures to post, but I guess that feature is no longer available here.  Buyers beware!  It may look great, but it will drain you patience quickly.  Do yourself a favor and DON'T buy this!	-1
A well priced 3D Printer with plenty of build room. Was looking forward to this and when it got delivered I dived in. I set it all up, removed the clips and then the fun started.  On Windows 8 the drivers that come with the printer are not digitally signed meaning you have to disable that check in Windows 8 itself before you can install the drivers. If you aren't computer savvy you should get someone else to do it for you or look at another 3D printer instead.  Their website always defaults to Korean where the printer is made which is just annoying.  Then the biggest issue happened, I had everything installed and turned on the 3D printer ready to load the filament but, like other reviewers here, the LCD didn't work. Pressing buttons just caused a beep noise. Without the LCD and working buttons, you can't load the filament to do anything with it. I power cycled the printer but no luck. In the end I packed it up and sent it back to Amazon for a refund. Luckily Amazon has a great returns policy and system to get it refunded.  Hopefully XYZ Printing will sort out their hardware issues in the future.	-1
First impressions/experience: Awaiting an affordable 3D printer, the DaVinci 1.0 seemed like a dream come true. I just so happened to run across this product the day before retail sale in the U.S. I recieved it 3 days later, had a great conversation with the delivery man about 3D printing and how it is now a real attainable thing. I carefully unpackaged the device and got it all set up. Plugged it into my PC and booted the machine. Expecting to see some sort of boot sequence in the display, it was disappointingly dark. Being optimistic, i assumed it was a firmware installation issue. After updating to the most current firmware, still just a dark display. The buttons will result in a beep, the machine goes through a physical boot sequence when turned on, the PC software recognizes that a filament cartridge has not been loaded properly. You must use the physical buttons on the device to navigate the display on the device to load cartridges, configure etc. I certainly hope that XYZprinting will send me a new product paying shipping both ways to remedy this situation. Point being, buyers be wary of buying new products. I will say in the defense of XYZ the packaging and layout of its product is quite nice. I immediately contacted customer service and Amazon in order to remedy the situation. New printer is on the way and review will be updated as seen fit.  Update: I have been working with the da Vinci for a week now and I'm pretty impressed. Keeping my expectations in the 500 dollar 3D printer range, this device is quite exceptional. Sure there are a few layering errors or filament feed problems along the way. However, the resolution of print and overall finished products are not too bad. Only a few minor issues such as a squealy X axis and a heated bed error. The heated bed error is typically after you've printed an object and the machine has gone into stand by mode. When waking the printer from stand by, the machine will load the .3w file and raise the bed in preparation to print. Once the bed is near temp, the machine flashes the 0010 heated bed incorrect temp error. Simply resetting the machine resolves this issue, but you just wasted 20 minutes getting things ready. Since I have shut the machine down between prints the only problem has been that amazon doesn't have any filament! Someone on MAKE has made a reset for the cartridge chip if you'd like to rewind your own cartridges and are tech savvy. Thanks for reading, the da Vinci will be a great starter 3D printer for someone who has no problems with troubleshooting. Hope this info helps, have a good day.  Update 2: Printer has failed once again. This time all is after the warranty on parts has run out. The communication with XYZPrinting's customer service is as flaky as a teenager. Haven't received any help from them at all. Calibrate the heat bed, install new firmware, update the software... Yeah the first 15 emails telling me to do this was quite fruitless. I found out more information on the forums than anything they ever did. So i did some work myself, after extensive testing the stepper motor on the hot end is overheating about 25 minutes into the print. I have now fully voided the warranty splicing the leads for the hot end and removed and tested stepper motor. After contacting customer support a week ago, they told me they would forward my request to purchase a new stepper with drive gear. Still haven't heard back. Nice, build a proprietary machine and not support it. I have since purchased and built a rostock max kit, and will never look back. Looking into using a bearing puller to remove gear and buy a cheapo stepper to work for now. Thanks for taking my $500 and running with it!	-1
It looked like it had a lot of potential, but I couldn't get the software to install.  I suspect it was a USB driver issue.  The instructions provided for Windows 10 just didn't work.  Files could not be found or were not allowed to be accessed.  I am going to return it.  I don't know how people managed to get theirs to work at all.  Also there was no explanation or reference to why there were two USB connectors on one end of the cable and only one on the other end.	-1
These things are terrible! They move more than the metal kinda. I made a video and you can see for yourself. I also tried them in the traditional fiberboard pegboard and they aren't any better! They do not lay flat against the pegboard either.	-1
Doesn't shrink very much, and won't adhere to anything	-1
Very poor quality. Avoid!  Cons: - 2/5 have level bottoms. The rest wobble on flat surfaces. - The stoppers have a very strong smell that is left behind on the flask even after scrubbing . - These are far from laboratory grade and will break very easily. - Graduations are off by as much as 10%.	-1
Well, in some respects this is a terrific vacuum.  It's powerful, it does the job, it's easy to maneuver.  Unfortunately, however, it is plagued with problems related to the lack of strength of some of its plastic parts.  First, the cord holder clip broke, so we have to hold the cord in one hand while pushing the machine around.  Then the clip that holds the front-mounted HEPA filter door closed broke, so the door flops open frequently, which results in dust (and cat hair) being blown away from you as you try to vacuum it up.  Then the clip that holds the dust canister to the body of the vacuum broke, so it doesn't stay in place, nor can you pick up the vacuum by its handle to move it.  To Shark's credit, when I contacted them about replacement parts, they asked how long we'd had it.  Two years.  Well, they said, it has a five-year warranty, so they're sending us replacement parts free.  That's good.  But why the cheap Chinese plastic fittings to begin with???  Sorry, but I just have no patience for this stuff, especially when the product is well designed--just not well built.	-1
Nothing special. Over priced for what you get. My 20+ yr old Hover is superior.  Was surprised how narrow the vacuum/brush area was. Just too small to clean very large rooms. Plus, I hate that the cord attaches near the bottom of the vacuum. I kept stepping on it. I'll cable tie it to the top somewhere.	-1
I initiall gave it 1 out of frusteration but as others mentioned you learn alot from this machine.  But as mentioned you will be putting out more money.  Currently I am replacing the power supply, motherboard and another hot end...To be fair when its running its great.  But since I have had it its been issue after issue.  3/27/2014  After learning from my initial mistakes and applying a few body modifications I have reached to a level of print quality and consistency that has exceeded my expectations. 5 stars.  Update: 5/6/2014  After fixing all that can go wrong with this machine, it will not function for a long time.  All those five star reviews are BS because look at those dates.  Eventually they will all come back and re edit there reviews.  The motherboard doesnt last long.  I went through 4 and they went away with the replacement program.  And thats when I stopped putting money into it.  At the moment its paper weight. With all the upgrades, hotends, motherboards etc its not worth it.  You will eventually have to go to another motherboard.  Total BS.  My next machine will cost thousands.  You get what you pay for.  ALWAYS.  People say its a good educational tool.  There right.  You will learn not to make the same mistake again. Give those five stars some time.	-1
Too small, get a 20# and don't worry about refills for a long time. All ready replaced.	-1
Warped badly.  There needs to be a disclaimer in the description stating that these plates have a good chance of not being flat.	-1
Doesn't feed properly on Fusion3 F-400.	-1
I have serious suspicions about the authenticity of this filament, as it is not factory sealed with desiccant. 3D Printing filament is extremely affected by humidity and must be stored air-tight. Product pops and cracks when you try to print with it due to the amount of moisture it has absorbed. I will no longer buy this filament from Amazon.	-1
Filament was undersized by about .10mm off nominal. Did not extrude well due to poor engagement with drive gear.	-1
Unless you want to print some figures for fun, stay away from this filament. I was trying to print some functionalk parts and after days of trying was not able to make this filament work in any acceptable way. On top of horribly bugged Simplyfy3D software it turned out into nightmare. No matter which flow multiplier I set, it would still underextrude horrible. I tried slowing down the print, that somewhat helped, but still, this filament is way too soft to print anything usable on modern 3D printer. Feed will be inconsistent, oozing is horrible too. You will waste half of this roll before you will be able to see any result at all, and the result will be mediocre at it's best. Part will require a lot of afterwork.	-1
Tried this on a Printrbot Go V2 and a (feed path modified) Replicator 2....didn't work for either one. I have seen it work on a direct drive rep-rap. I can't recommend this due to it being so soft it will have feed problems in most bots.	-1
As someone else said it is like trying to place cooked spaghetti into an extruder. It is so soft that it does not have the ability to compress itself enough to be extruded properly. It just backs up into the stepper motor. Tried it on a Makerbot Replicator 2 as well as two other different printers and had the same issue. Not sure how the other folks got this work based on their comments but trust me. This stuff is useless.	-1
Product quality is very good.  I have not used yet because they are not what I was expecting.  Not sure if the would leak liquids or not.	-1

Does not fuse. Rips. Doesn't stretch. I used "rescue tape" and F4 and they actually worked. I used other colors from this company and none of them worked.	-1
Doesn't stick to itself and simply unwraps over time and fails. Not worth messing around with, should have returned it.	-1
This is not tape. It is a wrap the fuses to itself. It will not stick to other surfaces	-1
Does not fuse. Rips like paper. Doesn't stretch. I used "rescue tape" and F4 and they actually worked. I used other colors from this company and none of them worked.	-1

This didn't work for me.  I was puzzled that there is no "stickyness" to it.  I wrapped it around a leaking drip system hose. It was difficult to hold in place while it cured and kept slipping around.  I finally used other tape to hold it in place.  It was difficult to wrap tightly.  I didn't know what to expect.  After it cured, it still leaked through the windings.  The leak was not as bad but it didn't fix the problem.  Save your money and time, try a different solution,.	-1
Purchased to patch a hose. It did not work at all. It couldn't take the pressure.	-1
