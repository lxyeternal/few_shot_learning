Contains some interesting stitches.	1
I'm a fairly experienced knitter of the one-color or color block intarsia vein, rather than a Fair Isle maestro, and what I loved best about this stitch guide is the multitude of reversible stitch patterns offered and shown reverse and obverse. If you knit and love to accumulate guides, stitch dictionaries, pattern books and design-your-own project books, this is a great resource. I find I'm always adapting knitting patterns slightly or significantly to swap out cables, add interesting borders so I can knit edges and body at the same time, what have you.  This gives you enough classic stitches to satisfy but its strength is in fresh twists on the usual or entirely new (at least to me) options in textured, lace, cables&cross stitches, slip st., and novelties. As others note, the stitches are arranged from simplest to most challenging in each section-- also a great help when deciding how much sweat and tears I'm wiling to expend.  This also does not frustrate me in the ways too many other books and guides do. Here, Leapman uses the symbols common in knitting magazines and most books on knitting you've seen. Yay! One of my peeves with some designers and guidebooks is the use of their own symbology for charting various stitches. Alice Starmore leaps to mind as a woman living in her own private Idaho filled with her own Runic symbols. I have to translate her every chart's cable squiggles into the symbols I'm more familiar with just to get the thing going. Gorgeous end results, but geez.  This is concise but full of options, so I FIND something nifty quickly and easily. While I do love browsing Barbara Walker's stitch books, sometimes I'm just looking for a simple option and don't want to spend all day combing through umpteen volumes, each of which has its own section for lace, k/p, cables, slip st.s, panels, etc. I wish Walker would compile all her lace, all cables, all k/p, all color work, all panels, etc into huge sections in just ONE encyclopedia.  Until that happens, this is my new go-to for fast, interesting ideas to enhance my knitting.  This is not a great resource for traditional knitting stitch patterns, such as gansey (guernsey), it's perhaps best for 'modern' classic knitting.	1
Great book but the index is terrible. Had to write and high light my own cross ref info.	1
I purchased the Kindle edition which is incredibly handy, particularly when traveling.  Melissa Leapman is always dependable for providing those wonderful necessities for knitters.	1
Very well laid out and very easy to read.  This book is also a nice size, not too big, but larger enough to use and see what is being presented. Fair price for the product.	1
Beginning her career as a freelance knitter, Melissa Leapman has designed her own collection of wonderful stitch patterns. Yes, there are old favorites here, but the depth of new stitch techniques and ideas of how to work them into patterns has really helped to round out my large, huge, library of stitch encyclopedias. While some lace is covered, it is not a huge book of lace designs. The world has many. They are needed, but I don't make much lace. If you want reverse stockinette, cables, texture and strong fabrication, this is a great book.  All patterns are charted, as well as written and the colors tabbing the section make sense. There is little on, "how to do basic stitches," taking up page space. While that information is important, I find the redundancy of the simple knit and purl to be a tree-wasting effort to round out some books, which would be better off without them. If you cannot knit, nor purl, perhaps this is not the book to start with. Which is fine! It's part of the journey of knitting. There is no end to this road of interest and there should not be, Texture, working patterns into garments and general beauty with color photographs, that are not over-the-top, but show the finished pattern in good light, are the hallmarks of this book.  If you knit can you exist without it? Well, of course. If you want to get a book with stitches I've not found elsewhere, then this is a must own. So much so, that after buying the edition for my Kindle, I got the book. I can't leave an entire sticky notepad's worth of paper in my Kindle. I can in the book and that's what I've done to this book. It sits in my pile in my studio space, within reach at all times. Right next to my Barbara Walker books and Vogue stitch dictionaries. I use it daily and make up swatches often, just to get a feel for them and to learn. Anyone who wants more will find this book a great resource. This is all my own thoughts. I am not being solicited in any way and  believe me, I can slam with the best of them.  Enjoy and get out the highlighter and notes. You're going to need them.	1
This is a terrific stitch handbook (and I have a few). What sets it apart from it's competitors:  1. Shows which patterns are good on both sides including pictures of both sides 2. Pictures are in color and show good detail 3. Better descriptions, many include how much "ease" or "give", especially useful to sock knitters. 4. Written instructions AND charts for every pattern and a good explanation of how to use charts.  I have the 365 calendar (good pictures, no charts, no description of fabric characteristics) and an aged copy of the Mon Tricot and various adds to pattern and instruction books but this is far superior to anything I've accumulated before.	1
The book needs to be coil bound. The content is lovely but the binding makes it almost imposible to use.	1
I really am enjoying this book! I like the size of the book itself, I love the patterns which are providing new grist for the creativity mill. The instructions, both charted and written are clear and well thought out. I like that you can see both the right side as well as the wrong side. I guess that I like everything about this book.  I'd love to see the same format with more 'regular' stitch works. I'm so pleased that I happened upon this book thanks to an Amazon recommendation in my email!	1
Just received this book and looked over it cover to cover. Each pattern has written and charted instructions and the photos are lovely.  The book contains Textured Knit and Purl Patterns, Lace and Openwork Patterns, Cables and Crossed Stitch Patterns, Slip Stitch Patterns, and Novelty Stitch Patterns.  There is also information on shaping knits within pattern stitches, designing projects worked in the round and other basic design info at the front of the book.  In the back of the book there are illustrations and instructions for knitting techniques, the abbreviations/symbols.  There are 288 pages total, but the book isn't so big that it shouldn't fit into your knitting bag.  While there are some stitch patterns I have seen before, there are enough 'new to me' stitches to make this worth the purchase.  I am very happy with it, and can't wait to start swatching.	1
Son and grandson and I do these together.  Nice family time.	1
This book is the perfect size to carry in your purse or diaper bag. My son loves the mazes which gives him a break from his coloring books. The answers are in the back if the child is having a little trouble completing the maze.	1
Great value for such a little book. I brought this in my travel pack for my toddler on the plane since he loves mazes. It would be great for a restaurant or doctors wait too! These would also make fabulous party supplies.  I will prob purchase another one for our next trip. It's small but thick and full of pages to last a few hours.	1
great for kids	1
Fun and simple. Easy to carry around for a boredom emergency.	1
Not easy to follow.  Not enough patterns and not very interesting to put together. I was expecting something better and more exciting.	-1
I knit a great deal and saw this book in it's first edition and wanted to buy it but it was out of print.  If you knit...get this book	1
If I had known that this book had two different covers; I would have only ordered one book.  I love the book and plan on making at least one counterpane	1
When I first saw this book years ago, I loved every counterpane in it. I started making one, and then lost the book. I am so glad to see it in print again. It is full of beautiful designs. One could use parts of these designs for edgings, etc if one didn't wish to make a whole bedspread. (I think most of the counterpanes call for small size knitting needles, like "0" or "00".  I know my metal ones are bent from making multistitch popcorns, etc.)	1
This magazine has been on my wish for awhile and I finally brought it....  There are several items I look forward to stitching.	1
Joan Elliott's designs are always fabulous.  Keeping her design books in my Cross Stitch library is a must.	1
Awesome designs can't wait to stitch them.	1
Excellent!  Would definitely buy again!	1
Anyone who loves Joan Elliott will love this book of dragons and sun and moon and other phantasmagorical designs!	1
*UPDATE* I LOVE THIS BOOK! I have done almost EVERYTHING in here as gifts or just 'cause. I m redoing the Cresent Moon Dragon again. The 1st time I did it on black and it looks FANTASTIC! Now I'm stitching it on a blue/grey tye dye fabric. This book ISN'T for beginners... itworks with evenweave fabric you have to work over 4 strands and its not only hard but it took me almost 8 months t finish the dragon because of that fact. The other ones are on regular Aida (you COULD do the dragon one on Aida but I'm a stickler for detail!) The charts are PERFECT... in full color and easy to read, 1/2 of the patterns take up more then 2 pages and each and every page is color. Some projects are small like post card size but the biggest one is the wizard (I am eagerly awaiting fabric or that one!), 18x22 inches!  I TOTALLY think its worth the money, I have had this book for a little over 2 years and i go to it whenever I need a project (my sister loved the Hope (bird) cross stitch and my cousin loved the egyptian style bookmark)... If you can afford the amount of money and time it takes (you need PLENTY of both) then this book is a must have!!  I found this book at the library and when i rented it i knew i had to buy it. the designs are a little big (1-4 pages) but the images when done are more then astounding. i am an avid cross stitching addict and have to work on three projects at the same time but with these they don't bore me or make me want to go to another design.	1
I love all things mythical and have fallen in love with this book. All of the patterns are extremely beautiful and so fun to stitch. I have already completed the "Mother Moon" and I am currently working on "Father Sun" and I have to say that they are both magnificent! The colors are rich, the details are beautiful, especially the metallic thread and the beading. If you are into stitching and love to do mythical type projects, this will be your favorite book. I first borrowed it from the library and after looking through it, I had to buy it for myself.	1
Joan Elliott has outdone herself with this book. Beautiful designs. Breathtaking colors. She was born to design for cross stitching. Every chart in this book is incredible. A friend just finished the Crecent Moon Dragon, and I am working on the Chinese Phoenix, my favorite in this collection. If you want a challenging, yet extremely enjoyable project, this book is for you!	1
Beautiful papers with solid color complementary backs.  I like the larger size, too.	1
Beautiful, nice quality	1
very good	1
I just received Donna Kato's Creative Surface effects.  This book appeals to me immensely as I love the heavy Asian art and Art Nouveau influences  The coloring of her projects feel both soft and strong, and I love her patterns.  I like this book as her designs are substantially fine art creations.  The designs are rich yet bold with patterns that are unique.  Techniques are well demonstrated through both pictures and clear instructions.  This is not quite for the novice as it assumes that you know the basic polymer clay techniques.  However, I think it would be a great addition to anyone's library because the point is to challenge ourselves.  So many beautiful things and never enough hours in a day.	1
good book	1
Nice	1
She is the Queen of Polymer Clay.	1
Great creative ideas	1
I enjoy all of Donna Kato's Books. They've given me lots of inspiration!	1
I got this book because it has projects that I can use my Kato Liquid Clay with. That a lot of other neat projects to try. Kato is an acknowledged expert in the polymer clay world and her projects are well tested and turn out so well.	1
I LOVE THIS BOOK!  The techniques are fabulous!  I wonder why I did not get it a lot sooner!! Recommend!	1
I love this book! I fell in love w/i this book 3 years ago in a well-known bookstore, where it was priced out of my reach, then. When I finally had a little more money, I thought to go to Amazon for the book, and got it so inexpensively that a friend asked to get a second copy for her. The book has basic information for beginners as well as the incredible 'special effects" this author is known for,and she gives detailed step-by-steps that are beautifully illustrated. Can't be beat. Love it!	1
A beautiful book full of helpful tips and techniques. Well organized with lots of good images. Highly recommended for polymer enthusiasts who want to expand their repertoire, as well as beginners who want to get a sense of where they can go with polymer clay.	1
As usual, all of Donna's books are top quality.  Her ideas really get the imagination going.  Try this, and any others she has written.	1
Donna Kato is at it again. She has many books out on many subjects. She has incorporated so many different techniques in this one book. She is a talented artist and it becomes evident in this, her latest book. She sparks my creative juices. Great Book.	1
I was surprised at how many "finishes" you can give Poly Clay. This book explains it all . She does show alot of "specialty tools" you can use - but they can be substituted with your own tools or simple copies. GREAT BOOK - Great Pictures and easy step by step instructions.	1
This is an amazing book and one that you should really get to add to your collection of polymer clay books.  There are soooooo many things in here to try. I just can't wait! Plus, buying it from here saved me lots of $$ over the local craft store cost and even ebay.	1
Here's the review I also have posted on my blog, Polymer Clay Review [...]  Yes, another 5-star book. Are there books I don't like as much? Yes. Have those been published lately? No.  It has been a decade-yes, a decade-since Donna published her first book, The Art of Polymer Clay. This second book takes us to Donna today. Her style is elegant, her techniques are innovative, and her instruction makes her projects accessible. I've taken two classes from Donna. In fact, I joined my local clay guild when I first started claying just to take Donna's class-and I haven't looked back.  Donna's book is like a portable Kato class. Donna taught many of these techniques in the classes I took from her. However, having this indispensable reference book enables me to review the class at my leisure and further experiment with her techniques. She approaches each technique in a straightforward manner-teach techniques, then apply them to a project. This enables us not only to complete a sample that masters the technique, but also a very beautiful finished piece that will get people talking.  Donna splits the book into seven different sections:    * Polymer Clay Basics   * Mica Shift Techniques   * Transferring Images Onto Polymer Clay   * Creating Texture   * Paints, Inks and Pigment Powders   * Special Effects with Liquid Polymer Clays   * Sculpture and Mold Making  I love Donna's techniques. They are the result of hours of experimentation and development on her part. The book details both how to do something-and why. For instance, Donna makes a mold from her rubber stamps using polymer clay and THEN uses that mold to create her pieces. She goes into detail about why she does this, and what the results are molding directly from a stamp versus taking an impression from a polymer clay mold made from a rubber stamp. It's something I never considered, but it makes great sense.  The twelve beautiful projects are accompanied by step-by-step instructions and photographs that walk you through each major component. While some projects are simple, others teach you techniques in constructing complex pieces like her coveted Japanese Inro boxes.  Peppered throughout the book are awe-inspiring inspirational pieces, including the pieces submitted for two of Kato Polyclay's artists contests/exhibitions-one focused on shoes (Feat of Clay) and one focused on boxes. I was honored to be the 2nd-place winner in the box contest, and my "Donnelly's Sampler" is included in the book.  This is yet another book that will stay in my permanent library. I love having a Donna class on my shelf, ready for me at any time.	1
Good reference book for a new or experienced quilter	1
As described. Quick ship. Would use seller again. Thanks!	1
Inspirational and very informative - Thank-You!	1
Got this as a refresher course in quilting. Good basic information. I had cleared out all of the quilting books from earlier years, so it is good to have one reference on the bookshelf. If I have to look something up, these are supposed to be the experts.	1
Lots of helpful tips.	1
Couldn't wait for it to get here. Started reading it as soon as I got home! Wonderful book that I can tell I will use as a guide forever! I recommend this book as a must for any quilter. There is something for everyone in it. Great pictures and step by step instructions for everything!	1
This book has helped out so  much. Easy to follow instructions with pictures, can't get any easier. If you you are a begginer or been quilting a long time this book is for you.	1
Very Nice book.	1
Very informative book!	1
My mother do things in quilting, and asked me this product I hope you help photo.	1
Great shape! great book!	1
Have any of the 5 star reviewers actually used the instructions to cut fabric for a quilt? The directions for cutting setting triangles for an on-point set are WRONG. If you follow these instructions, as I did, you will get triangles that are too small! I had to replace several yards of very expensive fabric thanks to the bad directions. The entire book is suspect now - I threw this POS in the trash. I am very disappointed that such well-respected quilters would give us a book with incorrect cutting directions.	-1
Great very happy	1
I really like it	1
I ordered 2 of these.  I got one and then bought one for a friend.  If you are a quilter or wanting to learn this book is for you.  This book has great pictures and simple instruction's to get you started.  The rest is just practice and hard work at getting more and more accurate.  I do not believe you can buy these books from box stores anymore so I was happy they had this book.	1
I was so excited to get this book; I have been a fan for a while and love the magazine. A complete resource, all in one place. I couldn't get it home fast enough.  The first thing I used it for was to cut the setting and corner triangles for a group of blocks that I was setting on point. I cut according to the instructions and sat down to sew. Waaaiiitt... they were ALL THE WRONG SIZE. Did I cut them wrong? I checked the instructions, nope, the instructions given in this book by well-known and admired authors to cut setting and corner triangles was WRONG. Naturally I had used all but a few inches of that special color, long out of print, not available anywhere, that tied it all together. I adapted my plan and  finished the quilt, but not before tossing this book in the trash. I would not donate or sell this error-ridden piece of junk to someone else.	-1
gift	1
ok	1
now I can learn the right way to do things	1
I had the original edition of this book and this is the updated version.  I use the guidelines for quilting a lot, since I am a relatively new quilter.  There are also some great patterns in this book.	1
This "Quilter's Complete Guide" by Marianne Fons is the very best guide for beginner quilters.  I still refer to this book after 12 years of quilting for refreshing my memory on How-To do a process.  I refer this book to beginner quilters as a MUST HAVE.  Thank you	1
fons and porter are my favorite quilters and show ...this guide will be very helpful and effective in my quilting efforts	1
I had checked this quilting book out of the library & loved it so much I purchased my own copy.  It has great info for beginners to expert quilters.  Would recommend this book to anyone who quilts or wants to learn.	1
I bought this for a friend of mine who is just starting to quilt.  I have my own copy that I purchased when I started quilting and what was informative 20 years ago is still informative today.	1
This is a wonderful book for any new quilter.  I highly recommend it and I do believe that it is the best book put on the market by Fons and Porter.  I certainly have learned a lot from it.  I purchased this one for a "newbie" quilter who now has a great guide if she runs into problems when making her quilts.	1
I am very happy with the content of this book, very informative as I am new to quilting. It was sold as used and looks like it is new.	1
This big book has tips and helpful guides for every step of quilting from start to finish. Highly recommend	1
this is another great book from the gooseberry cookbook line.  i get these for the wife and she immediatly reads through them.  she writes down which recipe and/or craft she wants to do.  she just loves gooseberry	1
Another cookbook from the set that is full of delicious recipes for Christmas and beyond.  These cookbooks are published annually and because the recipes are so down-home, even the early ones contain recipes that are still good for today.  The GP cookbooks never go out-of-date.  I love them.	1
I have all of the Christmas books, and love everyone of them.  Get great ideas for gift giving, and decorations.  Lots of Delicious recipes.  Mmmmmm Good.	1
Just the right size to put on my cards for extra accent.  They shimmer really nice and just made the card look extra special	1
Nice and snazzy to put on letters to a sponsored child in Bolivia.  :)  They're not the big- but will work fine to decorate the envelope and letter (roughly 1 x 1 3/4 inches).	1
Lovely. Perfect for cards and envelopes.	1
very cute stickers.  the kids loved them!	1
Nice with color	1
These are so cute!  I love to use these to make something I call "Jesus packets."  I have a group on Facebook about them if you want to check it out.  I'm going to get a bunch of these for Valentine's Day to give out! The packets are great to give to anyone at your church, homeless outreaches, orphanages, nursing homes etc.  In each packet/goody bag I put a Bible tract (I like the "Somebody Loves You" Bible tracts), candy and a bracelet that I make and maybe cookies or brownies that I make.  Go bless others today and buy these to share the gospel in a fun way!  Make some Jesus packet/Valentine goody bags for anyone and everyone you know!  "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come." Mt. 24:14.  Amen, come Lord Jesus come!  (check out my blog where I write about my packet making and other great topics: orangecountyangel.blogspot.com)  May God bless ya'll! :)	1
This item was exactly as described.  It will be very useful.  I am extremely glad I purchased it.  Thank you.	1
This book has so many quilting possibilities!  I mocked up blocks in Electric Quilt 7 so I could figure out my block placement using an asymmetrical layout, but relied on the patterns and directions in the book to actually make the blocks.  They are fun and easy to make and Lori has done an excellent job of providing step by step directions with pictures and pressing directions for each seam.  The one thing I did have to do was put a strip of post-its over the cutting chart for the size block I wasn't making, because I found myself cutting the wrong size!	1
What can I say, I LOVE this book of farm-related block patterns and quilts! Easy to understand instructions and the cutest designs ever! I'm working on a tractor block for a baby boy quilt, and plan to make many more quilts from these patterns. They are all absolutely adorable!	1
This is a great book and will keep a quilter quilting for many years.  There are so many projects you can complete with this book!	1
Good	1
I just love this book.  Several of my friends are making this quilt.  We finish two blocks per week.  It is fun to do.  Patterns are for easy and skilled quilters.	1
love it	1
Cute blocks.	1
Cutest block patterns you'll see!  Great directions with color illustrations.	1
Great ideas for the stash.	1
Lori Holt is my favorite quilt designer. If you love samplers, you'll love this book. Very clear directions and additional patterns for alternatives to the sampler. It can be made in 12" blocks or 6" blocks.	1
Great book! Received it on time and it will last me for a long time! Love it!	1
good product	1
Been using all this year as a BOM for our quilting guild.  Love the patterns and ideas by Lori Holt.	1
love it	1
Love this book.  Can hardly wait to finish what I'm working on to start this book.	1
Love this book. So many patterns, easy to follow and well written.	1
Love Lori Holt designs and especially the ones in this book.	1
Love Lori Holt's retro designs.	1
A lot of things I want to make from this book!	1
Great quilt pattern book.  Great price, great quality. Many patterns. Endless possibilities of quilts that can be made with these patterns. I highly recommend. You will not be disappointed.	1
Heard many good things about this book. Can/t wait.  Like the spiral bound.  Can't wait to start quilting.	1
Love this book,  it has so many wonderful blocks and most are given in two sizes to suit most needs.  Instructions are very clear,	1
Wonderful book.  Full of interesting ideas.  Instructions along with diagrams (pictures) excellent.	1
Great little book. I am enjoying my class and learning lots of new techniques	1
I love the patterns in this book, like having 2 size blocks to choose from and the directions are very easy to read and understand.  I've made 6 blocks so far and very happy with the way they turn out	1
Great patterns!  Can't wait to get started!	1
gift	1
if you like country quilt this is the book for you	1
I love the style, format and colors for the patterns in this book. I love that each block can be made in a 6" or 12" size. The patterns for using the made up blocks are ones I will actually make. I hate getting a book and not liking most of the patterns...this one is 100% LOVE... The spiral format is nice for being able to open to a page and leave it open. After going thru the book, I looked up the author on you tube, Love her simple ways without fancy sewing equipment. Using vintage irons, and graph paper for making new patterns. Great tutorial on making simple boards for your patchwork squares on the go, auditioning fabrics and keeping your pieces in order to bring to the sewing machine. I feel like I found a new cyber friend! I recommend this book and I am a city girl...who is country at heart.	1
Very clearly written, easy to follow directions. Nice color photos, lots of arrangements. Love this book and highly recommend it!	1
Fantastic book! Instructions, and many layout ideas	1
A VERY amazing quilting book. Love all the patterns doing a sew along with a ladies group extremely pleased with it.	1
Well written with easy to follow directions & color pictures.  Our guild is having fun with this block of the month.	1
Looks like fun. Can't wait to get started.	1
Wonderful book! Haven't made anything yet, but pictures and instructions seem great! Collecting fabric...	1
I am new to quilting. Just started in May, 2015. I got a little ambitious and thought I'd try my hand at following the quilt along with Lori Holt through this book. I gotta say, I had a ball making every block in this book, with the exception of 2 of them I haven't made yet. I made the 6 inch blocks, and even for a newbie, they weren't very complicated thanks to the awesome instructions and visuals! It's been 6 months since I started quilting and I gained lots of experience by doing the blocks in this book!  You will not regret purchasing Farm Girl Vintage!!	1
I love traditional and modern quilts and I feel like this book does a great job of combining the two with some new, fun quilt patterns. The directions are easy to follow and clear. As a new quilter I even started out with a harder quilt block (the farmhouse) but was able to successfully construct it. The patterns included in this book make me so happy! I'm inspired to create every time I open it!	1
Wow!  Just got my copy today and it exceeded all my expectations by a long shot!  I seriously was only interested in the milk can block after I saw a quilt made from the pattern online but I had no idea all the blocks in this book were designed for both 6" and 12" blocks so if you didn't want to make a whole quilt, you could take any of the 6" blocks and use them to make potholders which is just about the only thing I really have time to make right now.  I also loved the mason jar block which I've seen in one of her stand alone quilt patterns so it was a bonus to get this in the book as I didn't already have it.  Lori did a fabulous job pairing the fabric colors to each block theme and tying together all the block themes into farm related  motifs.  She has managed to design quilt blocks that I would think would normally be approached through paper piecing with simple squares and rectangles to get the most charming shapes like cherries, barns, little chicks, etc.  If you are a Lori Holt fabric collector you will get a big kick out of seeing many of the prints from her fabric designs in the blocks as well which really inspired me to want to pull out some of my fabrics to get started on my favorite blocks.  Although there are no sewing, knitting or other needle art themed blocks in the book which would really be a nice addition to the farm house/home made lifestyle theme of the book, there are plenty of prints with sewing motifs in them which made it extra special to me.  I noticed Lori used her classic color palette that she used in her last book Quilty Fun, but has added more grays and newsprint fabrics which I thought was awesome, giving the look a bit of a contemporary feel to it.  The other plus I found that I loved in the book is that most of the squares are based on 1/4" and 1/2" increments, only a few required cutting squares in 1/8" increments which are more challenging for me to get accurate cuts (I rely on Accu Cut and Sizzix quilt dies quite a bit for my cutting which are all based on the 1/4 and 1/2" increments).  I seriously cannot believe the huge amount of work that went into the making of this book.  It was well worth the price, there is just so much in there, it is jam packed with not only the blocks but many quilt patterns as well.  Well done Lori, so proud of you!  I know the Fat Quarter Shop sponsored a sew along online using this book so you can do an image search on Google to get a really good sense for what people have done with the patterns.  The theme of this book is so timely as more and more people are re-embracing home gardens, farm fresh produce, and our connection to the farmers that grow our food and yet the theme is also very authentic for Lori as she was raised on a farm as her parents and grandparents were so there are some very precious vintage black and white photos in the book that are just adorable.  I never knew that about Lori, it was fun to read a bit about her childhood growing up on a farm!  For some reason this book makes me want to go out and buy some seeds to start growing a little kitchen herb garden that I have been wanting to do for a good long time now!	1
Lots of fun blocks. Some are challenging but all are fun to make.	1
This book is so inspirational. I cannot wait to make all the blocks. I have 3 done so far and many more to come.  A wonderful online community to follow as well, with different ways people mix their fabrics to accomplish the blocks.  Very detailed instructions, pictures, and measurements.  The extra projects are cute as well. LOVE Lori's books.	1
Having a ball with this book.  There's so many possibilities.  Many quilt shops around the country have organized Farm Girl sewing groups, which makes it even more fun.  The instructions are easy to follow and are very Accuquilt die adaptable, which makes this project even easier.	1
I love this book!  It has so many fun patterns...you just want to try them all.  I love the photography and the instructions are written very well.  I love how the book lays open flat because of the spiral back. Lori Holt's patterns are just very fun!	1
adorable patterns, great ideas	1
Great quilting book!  Love that it is spiral bound!  there are lots of great patterns for a beautiful quilt!!	1
Some cute quilts in there	1
Can't wait to get started making the quilts in this book, one down.....	1
I love this baby quilt book.  I have used it for years; so much I lost/misplace my 1st and bought a 2nd.  My favorite gift to give somebody expecting is a quilt to go with their nursery, this book handles every aspect of simple easy to be made tops in a day!  I have made from cutting to quilting and binding one of these in just 10 hours.  And the response to the person receiving is the best feeling in itself!  You will not be sorry if you are a beginner and just getting the hang of sewing the instrucstions are very detailed and explained very clearly.  I would consider myself an exper sewer and still enjoy it.  I make my own patterns and create a lot of quilts that way but this is easy peasy!  Enjoy!	1
I saw this book at a Quilt shop.  They wanted full price for it.  I thought I would check on Amazon, and of course I found it at a great price.  Love the book.	1
If you like geometric patterns and you like fabric art, you will love this book. The projects are beautiful and the design options are endless. I am really inspired by what can be acheived with these fabric folding techniques. I love the dimension and texture that fabric folding adds to any project. I plan on incorporating these techniques into my art quilts. What fun!	1
Excellent	1
So cool. Planning on making curtains using some things shown in this book.	1
The title says it all.  The book thoroughly covers materials, technique and possible finished products.  I plan to use the technique to make lampshades soon.	1
I bought this book as a gift for a talented friend.  I know that she will be so pleased with this creative approach to sewing and art.  I am so taken with the book, that I am going to buy a copy for my own use as well.  The book is beautiful, creative and well written.  I have been sewing for a long time, and I just love this fresh approach.	1
and that is just the book! The instructions are actually easy to follow! Unbelievable for constructions of such apparanet complexity and wonder	1
this book knocked my socks off! i have been a fashion and interior designer for over 30 yrs......this book will inspire you in many ways. great condition and on time.	1
I have read this book -- interesting author with an interesting and unusual talent.  I think I just may have found a new addiction to rival my other fiber crafts.	1
Love this product. Being new to paper piecing and after trying this material I never want to use anything else. It's perfect. After trying 2 other types/brands, I finally found the perfect paper with Simple Foundations Translucent Vellum Paper. Only wish I could get it in 50ct or more. Fast delivery too.	1
Disappointed in product.  When using my home HP printer, the ink smeared to the touch-ruining the quilt pattern to be papered pieced. Had to wait a while for ink to dry.	-1
Saw this product in one of my Craftsy quilting classes. Having been a paper piecer for 25+ years, I was interested.  How wonderful to be able to draw/print foundations and be able to see sewing lines through the vellum for easier placement and more precise pre-cutting of patches. I think that this product  may be too expensive for a large project - newsprint or very thin copy paper is almost as good - but if money were no object, I would use it exclusively. If money IS an object, buy one pack for use on really small or otherwise challenging pieces. You may get hooked!	1
Just learning to paper piece	1
So much clearer and easier to use than newspaper type foundation.	1
Might be too expensive for using all the time but as a first time paper-piecer I would recommend highly.  It rips off material easily when using a small stitch.  Very easy to trace through and use.  I may use it all the time just to feel rich!	1
Will need more of this soon and will reorder this brand. :)	1
Not as heavy as I expected.	-1
Yes, this is a nice translucent paper for art projects, and also, for calligraphy. It is very smooth, and has a nice slick feel. It is heavy enough to not wrinkle. It also makes nice translucent envelopes.	1
These are thick, but they do the job!	1
I ordered the wrong item. But I will use it in my quilting.	1
Don't like this vellum...its not what I wanted or needed it for..but I assume its my fault for not clearing reading what this is...its VERY lightweight tracing paper not actual hard vellum card stock. live n learn	-1
Easy to use. Makes cards look glamorous.	1
Worked perfect with my Thanksgiving lanterans.	1
Love it.	1
It's vellum paper and it works like vellum paper. :o)	1
it is the best paper it isn't slippery, I have tried other paper and this is the one I use	1
I teach paper piecing classes and this vellum is my first choice for the patterns.  The students prefer this paper to other types of foundation papers because they can see the placement of the fabric pieces before they sew.  When printing, remove each page as it comes out of the printer and allow it to dry.  There is slight ink smearing otherwise.  Keep the stitch length smaller than normal to avoid stitches tearing out when you remove the paper.	1
I was excited to find this tool on sale at Amazon and was eager for it to arrive. Hugely disappointed! The caps won't stay on, especially on the stilleto side. This makes it a VERY DANGEROUS TOOL to have in your sewing kit. If you have children in your household, do not purchase this item. I am floored by the number of people who reported the problems with the caps, and still gave it a 5 star rating.  The other problem I have is that the glue used to keep the product stuck to the cardboard backing during shipping left a sticky residue. Removal leaves a stain. This product is made in China and I wonder just how much Alex was actually involved with it. I suspect it's her name that is used here, not her talents.	-1
I liked this tool but, I am finding that the caps don't fit tight enough.  I took this tool to a quilt retreat and I had to spend time looking for the caps: they'd just drop off.  This would have been just an annoyance until I realized, the hard way, how sharpe the ends really are.  If the shipping wasn't prohibitive, I'd send this back and ask for another one with better fitting caps.	1
I was excited when I first got this as a gift.  I like the 4 in 1 tool option, but the cap comes off all the time on the stiletto side. I have accidentally poked my fingers a few times when the cap came off in my sewing bag. Good concept, but bad delivery.	-1
gift purchase	1
good tool to have handy, little bit big but very convenient	1
Should have read information better, assuming will get you........! Not sellers fault, will keep and find a use!	1
My go to tool!	1
I love this product.  I use them all when I am quilting and this is a great product to have.  All three tools at you finger tips instead of having to get three separate products out to us.  Very well made!!!	1
Item as stated	1
Very handy, good size to manage while sewing.	1
Great!	1
The stiletto tip pulled out after only a couple of uses. This is not up to Alex Anderson's standards. I've had to throw it away and got a brass one instead. Sad as I love Alex but this was just not 'her'. Very disappointed in this :(	-1
I ordered this "tool" because of it being suggested by the designers of a paper-piecing pattern I just bought.  Being a "prime" member, it was not sent in the time frame of that membership.  Then when I did receive it...the metal tip of the seam ripper was broken off and inside the wooden cap.  When I found that, the shaft of the whole seam ripper piece came right out as if not glued and/or secured in the handle.  I am returning this for a refund, I don't even want to mess with a replacement.  I also informed CT Publishing of the dissatisfaction with this product.  I would suggest not to purchase this as a "real" quilter's tool.  Not good quality.	-1
well written	1
I love quilting and do a lot of small projects to give as gifts, usually using fabric I have leftover from larger projects. I always have small projects in the works. This book has a lot of cute patterns. I usually make a small project, pot holder, mug rug, etc. everyday. Then when I get several things accumulated, I bind and finish them all at once.	1
Just as described	1
I love this little book on making small mug rugs.  I can't wait to get started on some of the great projects.	1
so many cute mug rugs in this book....love it!	1
Lots of fun patterns to try...doesn't appear complicated...fast arrival	1
Nice book of ideas	1
Wonderful book, terrific order fulfillment	1
This book is filled with all kinds of projects to knit in lace: shawls, sweaters, scarves, accessories for the house, purses, and even gloves.  The book provides helpful tips for knitting lace such as a crochet guide, blocking techniques, tips for washing.  There are projects varied in difficulty and some are charted and others are written out and charted both.  There are many beautiful patterns in this book, several of which I hope to knit.  My favorite is Sarah Hatton's Beechwood Sweater with two lace panels on the top of a pull-over.  Naturally, this pattern is written out as I don't do well with charts.  The Dulcie Tunic, designed by Amanda Jones,  is also beautiful, knit with a lace center and bottom on a pull-over sweater.  There are wonderful shawls in this book for those of us who love to knit these.  The designers are varied with many that are new to me.  However, their taste is sublime for the most part.  There are some projects that don't really speak to me but, for the most part, this is an excellent selection of patterns.  I would recommend this book for the more experienced lace knitter.  It is not really appropriate for beginners.	1
Thank you. I look forward to some new patterns. Now I need some new yarn to start these new projects.	1
I love the way this book is designed, from the photos to the easy instructions for the lace projects.  The projects are actually things I would wear, too!	1
Never have I seen one book that had so many memorable patterns. There are many projects I have plans for in this book, including the gorgeous pink lace sweater and the fingerless mitts on the cover. If you like to knit lace, this is a must have book.	1
I love looking at the beautiful patterns and am looking forward to trying some in the near future, they would be beautiful gifts.	1
With more than 130 alphabet designs, the choices in adding the personalization of a name, monograms, cities, etc., to a project are wonderful! The size, style and variety of letters to choose from make this book a "must have" for any crafter, as it includes very simple design letters for the beginner and beautiful, flowing detailed script for the more-advanced user.	1
Will use this book for years to come, has loads of alphabets from juvenile to elegant.	1
I bought this book of cross stitch alphabets a number of years ago.  I have used it a number of times to customize my projects - everything from names to sayings to words I want to memorialize in an art project.  I like that there are so many choices and that the alphabets are all so different from one another.  I have several alphabet booklets and this one is one of my favorites.	1
Nice addition to pattern collection	1
This book is extremely useful for me and I highly recommend to all future and now grandmothers, mothers, aunts and all women!  I cross stitched my first grandson's name and now it is proudly hang on his room door by his mother!	1
My only complaint is that all of the types don't offer lower case letters as well as upper case.  Most do but not all.  Clear, easy to follow patterns.	1
Please see the Images I uploaded above.  I think it's very helpful to know what's inside a book and the front and back covers and page 2 cover display all 136 alphabets in the book.  As stitchers, we all know that we should be signing and dating our projects, however humble, because they will be heirlooms someday.  I have used the Olde English type script as my signature on a historic sampler and also a cheerful bold one for my son's baby afghan.  The inside front cover holds a b&w key to the 3 pages of alphabets for quick finding of the one you choose.  I love these Leisure Arts Charts For Le$$ and have a bunch of 'em.  They're just always coming in handy.  ---------  **PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT ON JUNE 26, 2013 AMAZON REMOVED CUSTOMER-UPLOADED IMAGES FROM PRODUCT PAGES**	1
I like the stickers and they do remind me of vintage Americana; however, they are printed on flat paper, not shiny paper as a lot of the originals were.  Also, one cannot use them on an adult size vintage suitcase because they are too small.  They are more child size or mini stickers.  Wish they could have had a little bit more variety, too.  All in all, very nice tin, cute stickers!	1
will def use these	1
Retro cuteness	1
My wife is presently has a health problem and needs the aid of a "Walker" to get around and you know how women with looking good. The walker is blah. So, she decided to spoof it up and since she likes to travel and the walker is a transport tool then put travel labels on it.	1
Great little tin filled with great bird photos.	1
I do really like these. They're nice to add to stationary or the back flap of an envelope that I want to keep sealed while moving through the mail. There are two pages of 12 designs, package says 100 + stickers. Not kiddy bright but rather subdued colors. Some of the stickers are rather simple such as bird's nest or the word "bird", I like the tin these stickers come in. Easy to store and just neat organization. The back of the tin shows exactly what's inside. I also use these in scrapbooking. The stickers are oval. Some are quite big. The hummingbird, for instance, is just so attractive. These are not "American" bird breeds but they closely resemble some of ours. The stickers are printed on Italian stock, some images have words behind them. Very pretty!	1
This is a very good inspirational book on making bags and purses for any occasion. Many times when looking through a craft book written by one person, when all the ideas are theirs, there tends to be a sameness about the projects, but not this book. More than just the author's ideas, there are purses made by many contributors which helps give an even larger variety of ideas than one person can accomplish on their own. There are also many different needlecraft types used for the different purses, so whatever your favorite type of needlecraft, you can find a purse to make. There are purses made in leather, cloth appliqus, crocheted, needlepoint, etc. The bags come in every size too, from larger tote style bags to tiny purses that you can use for a necklace. Lots of full color photographs of the projects also.  The only really bad thing I observed in this book is no actual patterns which for some of us that are drawing impaired could be a problem. But all in all a good book that should inspire you as you craft your next purse.  I was surprised to see the many negative reviews here on this book. I will admit that I wouldn't want to make some of the bags in this purse, but then I have seen advertisements for purses that cost over $13,000 that I wouldn't use if you paid me. Everyone has their own tastes. If you are looking for ideas on different types of bags to make, this book will give you plenty of many different types.	1
Another Nature Knit Book.  Norah has created some really refreshing knit patterns.  I love the designs.	1
Did not care for these designs.  They seemed to be lots of work and not good for practical wearing.  The designs are creative and look good on models, but I knew I would not wear any of them, so did not take on the work, and searching for the errata pages.	-1
This interesting knitting book has chapters titled Hexagons, Pentagons, Spirals, Phyllotaxis, Fractals and Waves. All of the patterns are inspired by natural forms found in nature The author, Norah Gaughan, in the introduction, states that she has "always been torn between simultaneous desires to study art and science". This book is a good example of how she combines the two and creates beauty. As Norah's life progressed, she realized that what she truly loved was knitting and wanted to make a career as a knitting designer. "The work in this book feels like the melding of my science - and art-loving selves...". "Some of the designs in this book are structurally similar to nature's example." This can be seen by the chapter headings themselves. "In some cases, the structure of the natural phenomenon dictated the structure of the garment (the garments made from hexagonal and pentagonal pieces, for instance). In others, the pattern from nature become a surface decoration imposed on the grid of knitting...". "In all cases, working within the framework of six categories of patterns found in nature freed my mind to look at things differently and allowed me to rethink the structure of garment-making."  Many of the patterns are eye-catching and lovely. In Hexagons, the Asymmetrical Cardigan in a lovely light blue hue is definitely a pattern I want to try. It is knit in cashmere . The stitch in this cardigan is modeled after the woven pattern of caned chair seats. The Hex Afghan is stunning. Knit in a rich brownish-red, half alpaca and half wool, it contains rows of elongated hexagons.  The Swirled Pentagon Pullover is luscious. Knit in an angora and wool blend, it is an almost turquoise colorway. The top of the pullover has swirled pentagons and the bottom of the sweater is knit in a classic stockinette stitch. The Bubble Pullover is knit in a lovely violet color out of baby alpaca. It has large pentagons as its motif.  The Spiral Scarf is very 'now'. Its contemporary feel is obvious to the knitter. It is knit with Mongolian Cashmere in a golden and blue hue and is comprised of spirals attached together. The Cabled Spiral Pullover is knit in a light blue colorway from extra fine merino DK. There is a spiral motif on the top and the bottom two thirds of the sweater is knit in stockinette stitch.  The Roundabout Leaf Tank is knit in an ivory hue with silk yarn. "The seater is made out of a spiraling strip, in the same way that leaves grow on a stem." The Phyllotaxis Scarf is perfect for a man or woman. Knit in a brown colorway with a wool, mohair and silk combination yarn, it is reversible. The scarf is knit in a tube to make its reversibility possible. "There are five spirals slanting to the right and eight spirals slanting to the left so the pair from the Fibonacci sequence is 5-8." I love the Sunflower Tam. There are two examples in the photograph. One is green and the other yellow. They are knit with Icelandic wool. "For this tam, I wanted to make a disk with two opposing spirals, like the phyllotaxis of a sunflower, daisy, or coneflower."  The Fractal section has several nice patterns. I really like the Branching Aran Guernsey knit with wool. "I purposefully incorporated some traditional elements of the British guernsey into this design - the drop-shoulder shaping and the simple ladder pattern between the columns of the cables - and like the way they play against the naturalistic, very modern, branching cables." The Serpentin Coat, knit in browns and blues with merino wool, is perfect for an autumn day. "The sinuous motif used on the yoke of this coat is a Dragon Curve, another mathematical fractal." The Triangle Scarf is in a dark beige and knit with a combination of nylon and rayon yarn. It features triangles based on a mathematical fractal called the Serpinski Triangle.  The Wave section of the book has several lovely patterns. I really like the Vortex Street Pullover in a green/brown blend knit with cotton. "A phenomenon of fluid dynamics, a vortex street is an organized pattern of spirals formed in the wake of fluid flowing past a solid object." The center of this pullover has a wave section with stockinette surrounding it. The Reflection Aran Pullover is knit in a deep wine color out of wool. "Inspired by the rule of wave reflection, the cables in this pullover 'reflect' off of the edges of the center panel." The Droplet Hat is another Aran pattern knit in a green colorway with wool yarn. "This design is based upon a photo showing a droplet of water speeding downward propelled by gravity, spewing off little droplets as well as a narrow trail of water. My interpretation is rendered in bobbles and embossed leaves."  Overall, this book is a real winner with clear photographs of the projects and easy-to-read pattern instructions. Some of the photos are a bit sexist for my taste but I can overlook that. They just seem silly. The book itself is a very welcome addition to my knitting library.	1
This book was sent as a gift to an experienced knitter who is a member of a Saturday knitting club. The recipient was looking for a resource book of fresh styles and ideas which could be modified and expanded upon rather than a book of basic techniques.  I think that for any book about the knitting hobby requires the reader to have experience sufficient to catch any errors which may occur in its text and to modify and expand freely on designs. Membership in a knitting club is also desirable so that other knitters can help sort out problems. I'd not recommend it (or any book at this level) for someone who has less than several years of knitting or who is attempting to use it without peer support.	1
I was looking for some basic information on this type of jewelry making and this book completely surprised me by it's depth.  Nicely detailed instructions and photos.  The projects were interesting and I quite enjoyed making a few of them.  Somehow I missed that there were supplies included and that was fabulous.  Great introduction to the idea of using Shrink Plastic as jewelry and honestly I can't imagine how it could be improved.	1
I love all of the books I have ever gotten from Klutz.  This one is no different.  It teaches a fun technique in a very informative easy to understand way.	1
This book is absolute a must have.  I combine cross stitch with hardanger embroidery.  I find the vanity of alpha designs the answer to creating project that are NOT boring.	1
I love thisbook.  I am an advanced stitcher.  There are so many ideas here at an affordable price.  I saw some charts that will guide me in making delightful gifts for friends.	1
Great collection	1
These guides are great. I have one for each type of handiwork and keep them in the bag with my work. Since I have some trouble with my memory, I keep the appropriate guide out while I am working to be sure I don't mess up too badly. Also, I don't use some of the stitches very often and hate to have to drag a bulky book around with me.	1
I received my copy last week and am itching to get started.  I am a big fan of shawls that begin simply and have their details on the edging so they can be worn as scarves.  The patterns are very clear and the pictures are quite nice.  This is a good way to practice the knitting lace techniques.	1
I just received this book yesterday and took it to my open knit tonight. Everyone looked at it and now they want to get one for themselves. The patterns are beautiful and seem to be relatively easy. A nice book toad to your collection.	1
A nice variety of patterns.	1
I have the second book in the series as well.  There are both written instructions and charts for each of the shawls.  Once blocked, the beautiful lace patterns are very clear and defined.  Why four starts and not five?  Sizing.  When knitting in the gauge, the shawls ran on the small side for the recipients - these shawls knit perfect for someone that wears a solid medium size.  I adjusted the sizing by adding extra row repeats strategically. As for complexity, I am not a good judge for someone else.  I regularly knit "intermediate" patterns with no issues.  I recommend if you have a stitch that is new to you, to create a sample and practice the unfamiliar stitch for a few rows.  This way the stitch that is new to you will be even when you knit it within the shawl.  Happy knitting!	1
Love the shawls that are on the book and can't wait to start my first one. Thank you.	1
Nice photos and patterns.	1
Jen Lucas has written a clear, concise pattern and instruction book for knitting lace shawls. She presents the easiest shawls first so beginning lace shawl knitters can ease into learning the new techniques easily. Her shawl patterns are beautiful!	1
Great sock yarn stash buster. Makes you think outside of the box to use up what you have also.	1
it's a beautiful book	1
One of the best books on  shawls I have come across in recent  years.  I do a lot of lace knitting and sock knitting.  The books combines the best of both.	1
Wonderful book with so many projects it's hard to choose which one to make first. Very exciting book with lots of great pictures of each item.	1
I love sock yarn. Hate big needles. This book was made for me!  Lovely patterns. Gifts from this book will be appreciated by everyone.	1
Page 74 tab cast on is the basis to begin a triangular lace shawl. I love this style. You can continue with just the what it's call a yarn over basic shawl or get into the lace. I am knitting page  13 inflorescence shawl pattern. I have accumulated a lot of sock yarn, mostly cascade heritage, solid colors. I am using red for this shawl. I plan to use the 3 different blues in bands of color changes maybe 4 inches each light to dark like a colorwash. I am early in the category of intermediate knitter and feel this book a challenge yet possible. Starting in December knitting gifts for 2014 birthdays and Christmas. I am very pleased with the style this book is written in, easy to follow. Charts are written out, easier for Mr to do than the picture of a chart for me. Worth the investment. Worthy to be in your knitting collection.	1
This beautiful book for knitters is filled with shawl patterns that can be knit with sock yarns.  If you're like me, you have tons of sock yarns in your stash and don't want to use all of it on socks.  This provides a wonderful alternative for all that beautiful sock yarn.  Most of the patterns require just one skein and that means you won't have to go out and spend a lot of money on new yarns.  The patterns are both written out and charted, which works well for me as I prefer the written out patterns.  This is a beautiful book and a wonderful addition to every knitter's library.	1
This book was made for those of us with lots of extra balls of yarn stacked to the ceiling. It is an excellent book with choices of all kinds of knitting styles. Whether you like lace, texture or even some variable yarn colorways, there is probably quite a few designs you will want to knit.  This is truly one of the few books where I am having a very hard time picking out the first one to knit. I like all of them for one reason or another. They are generally easy to knit and I think you will love these fun designs.  The designs are meant for the most part to be able to finish with a 100g ball of yarn with 400 yd.	1
I'm salivating to get started on this book.  I have a lot of sock yarn in my stash.  I have a large wingspan and often wish there were instructions to enlarge a complex pattern.  This book does just that!  Yeah.	1
I haven't had the opportunity to make any of the quilts from this book as of yet.  It says the quilts are deceptively easy to make--I hope so, because they are beautiful and I'm hoping I don't have problems.  I'm not very experienced.	1
The 11 projects in Barbara Cline's new book Simply Triangles are striking and lovely; Ms. Cline imparts a surprising amount of diversity to the humble 60-degree triangle.  First, she dresses up the conventional 6-pointed star with 7 patterns that incorporate borders, stacked strippy units, and even applique (making for a very Dresden-like star).  Next, triangles morph into flowers with 2 unique designs.  Cline ends with two Pinwheel-based projects: one is embellished with buttons and the other has a vivid tessellating appearance.  Each project includes a short "Life Lessons" box illustrating the huge influence on the author of her Mennonite family.  Photographs are in abundance, and highlight the exceptionally nice quilting details.  Both traditional and contemporary quilters will find something very pleasing here.  As for skill level, my opinion is that this book might be a challenge for some new beginners, as there are templates (included) and Y-seams;  precision piecing skills will be a must.  But I still recommend this book for all skill levels, as I remember when I first started out I went straight to the tough stuff so I could learn everything all at once.  (In retrospect, perhaps that approach is not recommended!)  Additionally, an endless supply of fabrics - or friends with fabrics - would be helpful because each quilt allows wonderful opportunities to play with value and contrast.  This book is set apart from all the rest, and not just for its beautiful contents.  Budget-conscious quilters might like to know there could be an extra ruler, an additional tool, and new products in their future:  1. Ruler -  Creative Grids 60-degree Triangle&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Creative-Grids-60-Degree-Triangle-Finished-Size-Up-to-8-Quilting-Ruler/dp/B0017RGKCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Creative Grids 60 Degree Triangle (Finished Size Up to 8") Quilting Ruler</a>.  I was hoping I could use the Clear-View Triangle I already own, but no.  The CG triangle is longer (and thus wider at the base) than the CV one, and most importantly the CG also has a differently configured tip. 2. Tool - Ms. Cline recommends using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Jinny-Beyer-Perfect-Piecer-Quilt-Template/dp/B0050W9FRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Jinny Beyer Perfect Piecer Quilt Template</a>&nbsp;for help with Y-seams 3. Materials - 108-inch wide black nylon netting (used as an overlay to create an amazing receding effect in several projects), batiste (for triangle foundations), 20-inch wide double-sided fusible web (Ms. Cline uses Shades SoftFuse which will add significant cost to your projects:  each 8x9 inch segment is about 1.00 per piece)  Ms. Cline is also the author of another absolutely stunning book&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Star-Struck-Quilts-Dazzling-Diamonds-Tradiational-Blocks-13-Skill-Building-Projects/dp/157120959X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Star Struck Quilts: Dazzling Diamonds & Tradiational Blocks; 13 Skill-Building Projects</a>.  Now that I own both books I am convinced she is in a class of her own, and the quilting industry is fortunate to have such an inventive talent.	1
Lots of fun ideas in this. Don't limit yourself or your imagination.	1
good	1
If you love doing points this book is for you.	1
Great book on quilting with triangles.	1
great patterns	1
Great	1
GREAT	1
This book is well written and informative.	1
I like the book	1
This is a great book - the instructions are easy to follow and the diagrams and pictures are great help.  I like the little personal stories included as well!  If anyone is worried about using the netting, you could do what I did with Star Shuffle and just add an extra shade of color for the needed contrast!  If you buy the kindle version, you can print out full size templates from a web link as well, so no worries!	1
Excellent	1
love it	1
Its fantastic the color and very easy to make	1
This useful tool is well laid out to help understand how colors are related to each other and how they work together.  One of the better color guides I have ever seen.  The person who shipped the product did a great job of packaging and it arrived before the promised delivery period.	1
I'm a quilter and this reference tool is super and especially helpful for the color challenged individual like myself.  I like the format presentation too.	1
perfect	1
Very comprehensive book to use in designing the perfect color schemes for your projects.	1
Great tool for any artist or lay person interested in color.  A lot of good information in an accessible format.	1
What a helpful tool!  So easy to use with great explanations and lots of practical examples.	1
Great tool. All my quilting buddies are jealous.	1
I am finding this really handy to help me with color choice.	1
The Ultimate 3-in-1 Color Tool is excellent for learning how colors work together making it very useful for quilters but it is also useful to scrapbookers, artists and anyone who works with color. It works very well with Joen Wolfrom's book, Color Play: Easy Steps to Imaginative Color in Quilts. I found using the Color Tool and the book together helped me understand how colors and their variations work together.	1
plan on using it in my teaching	1
Very useful product. Fast shipping.	1
So I am an adult. I love colors, but I don't know how colors work.  Should I be ashamed? Nah because with this color wheel and the enclosed instructions I don't have to figure it out. The cards are a great size and easily mobile, easy to take shopping with you for when you need to check out the paint-chip, the color of the dress or any other color related issue.	1
thanks	1
This is the best color guide I've ever used. If your indought just get it you won't be sorry	1
I have difficulty with subtle variations of color (grey-green or brown-green?) This visual tool has been a big help.	1
a must have in every quilter's notions! I purchased several and keep one in my sewing room, one in my purse and one in my case which I carry my sewing machine in. I think I should put one in each of our cars...LOL  If you have trouble visualizing what colors will work, just flip over the tool and it will show you several options for each color in the pack...no more wondering about color theory, it's all very simplified for easy use...you'll want several!	1
Didn't realize I already had it so gave it to a friend instead.	1
Just as described, delivered on time. thank you	1
Complicated to figure out but the color are nice.	1
I learned so much with this tool. I went through all my pencil brands to find each exact "pure" color marked on each color card. I made a color chart and use it for picking colors within the same family of color. Myself and friends were surprised to see a color we would have chosen as red is actually the "pure" orange. The color combination are endless.	1
AWESOME PRODUCT. You can't go wrong with your color scheme. The instructions explain basic color theory and pallet very well. I would get her book and then take her Craftsy class. Now, the class is a struggle to get through as she goes deep into color theory. However, if you stick with it until the end, you will never, ever look at color the same way again! You will be a COLOR MASTER!	1
I refer to this all the time.  My color sense is not the best and this really helps me decide on color combos.	1
Exactly what I was looking for!	1
Had one of the earlier versions of this tool.  Real aid when trying to develope a color scheme for art quilt projects.	1
I really love the set-up of this tool.  As a needlepoint artist it really provides lots of exciting new ideas for designing.  I learn something new every time I pick it up!	1
Great product and fast shipping.	1
I like the size of this.  I can carry around in my purse.  When I am out and looking at material for a project it is with me and I can just pull out and see if color matches my project.	1
great product, great service	1
This is a little complicated to use but once you get the hang of it, it becomes very helpful. It's given me courage to try color combinations I wouldn't have dared try before, and I'm always happy with my results.  For an experienced quilter this may be overkill but for a beginner or advanced beginner, this is handy.	1
i have good 'color memory' but there are days when fabric and paint and everything else just kind of blend in together--this handy tool fits in my bag and is exactly what i needed.	1
This is a must have tool for quilters. Some of the best art quilts my grinds and I have are based on taking one color and designing s unique quilt based on the tones, values and complements of the assigned pure color. I give these as gifts often.	1
Very usefull	1
Bought this as a drawing prize for our quilt guild and the winner says she loves it.	1
This is the coolest tool.  Thanks for shipping so promptly.	1
I got this in the mail today and was so excited with how neat this is. It is going to be a perfect tool when I pick fabrics for my quilts.	1
This is a great little tool. I actually bought two of them. I keep one in my sewing room which I use for quilting. The other I use for helping to coordinate home decor. It lives in my car with a note of which cards coordinate with my home. It is very handy.	1
Love my Color Tool	1
Very helpful for planning a quilt and shopping for fabric.	1
This booklet of color swatches is very helpful!  I use it to get an idea of mixing paints for my airbrush.  It's definitely worth the money.	1
I carry this around in my purse, now, to help choose colors for quilting material. The red and green filters have made it MUCH easier to choose a range of colors to give better contrast in fabric choices. I have started using them in collage creation, also, when I'n stuck on what to do next. They always help determine whether to go darker or lighter. And the color cards themselves, that help choose color combinations, are great. I'm not much of an artist or quilter, but this, I think, makes me a better one than I would be without it.	1
This is a great tool for matching colors within the same color group.  I keep it in my purse when I go to purchase fabric and use it to help me coordinate my pieces.	1
Very nice color tool.  Helps to see what colors will look like with black/white added. Shades and values are easy to see, easier to mix when following the colors from this tool. Also good when checking color combinations for quilting.	1
This is very helpful when picking out fabric. I even got one for my sister.  We are both quilters and some times when you see certain colors together, it's hard to know for sure if they actually go together, this tool helps and confirms your choices.	1
I've recently started quilting after having sewn for many years.  I often have trouble determining what the undertones to a color are.  Red can have a blue, orange, yellow, etc., undertone and in some projects it really matters.  I have found this tool to be a great help in figuring that out.  Even if my exact color is not matched on a card, there are enough swatches that I can at least determine which page it belongs on.  Here's to happy quilting!	1
With the use of the wonderful tool.  If you want to insure your colors blend, or spark or just plain jump out, this removes any doubt about how they will be together.	1
I'm the kind of person who has no idea what colors go well together, but who wants to make beautiful quilts. This little tool makes shopping for gorgeous quilt fabric a pleasure! I identify the swatch card for my focus fabric, decided which of the suggested color combinations I want to use, pull those color swatch cards and go shopping! The result is always a surprisingly delightful quilt.	1
I am not naturally educated or confident about what colors go with other colors. This fits in my purse and gives me a great tool for figuring out what fabrics I need for quilting a particular product. I still have my color wheel, too, but this is such a great help for me when at the fabric store, don't know what I would do without it.	1
Great book !!!	1
very nice book, patterns are nicely written and work up well	1
Love it.	1
I have the yellow books and now if I loan one out I don't have to worry about losing my place.	1
I am on my second shall out of this book and they are wonderful and the patterns are so easy to understand.	1
these craft books are great, I love to find all the information I can get. I always try to learn more stitches, and creative ways to make new things.  I hope you will enjoy this  as much as I do. It all depends on your hobbies, and the things you like to do.	1
I just received this little book, and absolutely love it!  After looking at all of the patterns included (more than a few times), it is really difficult to choose one to start working on.  Photos are included for each shawl pattern, and I feel this is not only a great feature for the crocheter to know what the shawl will look like when completed, but also to aid in choosing which shawl to make for a particular person.  I love this book and its easy instructions, and I'm sure with each shawl I crochet I will love it even more.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys crocheting.	1
Great ruler that is highly versatile. There will be many reasons to use this ruler. So glad I was able to get it	1
I have really been enjoying hex quilt pattern	1
I am just starting quilting class and my instructor said this would be a handy one to have. I haven't used it much...yet. But, so far so good.	1
Haven't used it yet but watching the tutorials on what I can do with this ruler has me excited to start my next project.	1
Great for quilting	1
Unique ruler. Makes interresting shapes for unique quilt blocks.	1
great ruler, has a lot of uses.	1
Very useful tool in conjunction with or without the hex and more ruler.	1
Love it great quality!	1
Just as Described	1
Great ruler! Quilts come together in a flash- takes a lot of the guesswork out of angles.	1
In addition to 'night sky' (or twilight in my case) I'm thinking about a storm at sea quilt - the setting (sashing) strips. I like how it isn't too slick.	1
Very good!!!!!!!!!!!	1
haven't used it yet, but looks good.	1
Wanted them for quilting.	1
Great for that special quilt project.	1
easy to use and my quilt turned out beautiful.	1
I don't understand how to use it	-1
I wanted a simple, fast to quilt up pattern that I could use for different projects! This is wonderful...table topper, tree skirt, splash of color for my easy chair.was shipped super fast too!	1
The Rock Candy Table Topper is fun to sew and quilt, and it's an awesome looking topper once it's completed.	1
Just as Described	1
I look forward to do this. It's not adifficult as it looks!	1
Nice pattern.	1
Soooo pretty	1
This made up beautifully. Easy pattern.  The Kona Cotton Solids Sunset charm pack made it look like the picture.	1
I have not used it yet. I want to maybe one of these days. At least I have it and I cam.	1
High quality canvas textured surface, good for dry and wet media.  This is a tough rough surface that I like working on.	1
Fantastic value on this paper. I was working it pretty hard and it stayed intact. I will buy again if I ever run out. Nice tooth. Smoother than most water color papers.	1
Might be okay for markers or drawing, but is too thirsty for watercolor. Every color I tried dried with a hard edge.	-1
The best watercolor paper I've used so far. I really love the way my watercolors behave on this paper. Flat washes are much easier now.	1
I really like this paper! It has nice weight at 140 lbs., and it has 32 sheets, which is an awesome deal at two packs for $18 and some change! It is cold press, so it has tooth to it, and I like the linen-look to it. It's a great value! I find that it holds up well to watercolor markers and watercolor pencils, as well as normal watercolor paints. It's also nice for mixed media work. My son uses it for ink drawings and zentangles, etc. I will definitely buy again!	1
This is an excellent product.	1
high quality, thick paper. markers did not bleed through	1
I really like the quality of the paper	1
This paper is fantastic!!!	1
Great pad with thick sheets! I bought this for my son and so far he's been happy with the quality of this paper.	1
This is not the Swiss made Faber-Castell colored pencils. They are made in India and are for the value-conscious market. The pencils do have decent color vibrancy and works well on paper. This is very appropriate for little kids who are working themselves up from using crayons to more accurate forms of drawing and coloring. Very good value and appropriate for little kids.	1
Needed to sharpen over half of these out of the box, so poor quality control. A super sharp sharpener is required to keep them from breaking, they are triangle shape which feels funny to me but they won't roll off the table. The colors aren't labeled on each pencil which can be confusing. They're kind of hard and don't really blend that well. I wouldn't recommend these for more than a 3rd grader and for the money there are better brands of school grade pencils. Blick has a better 24 pack for about $4.	-1
I really like these colored pencils. The main pencils that I use are the expensive Prismacolor, but these hold up well next to those, but are much less expensive, and buying them on Amazon saves me even more money on all of them. I have bought three different Faber-Castell sets and love them all. They offer colors that even my 132 color set of Prismacolor don't. I highly recommend having more than 1 or 2 sets of colored pencils if you are a serious colorist. They may all have light blue or pink, but every sets colors are different and make you collection even more versatile!!!	1
Love these	1
Bought these for my sister along with a quilters coloring book for her recovery from open heart surgery. She says the pencils were very smooth.	1
Would order again.	1
Lovely.	1
First of all, I wasn't sure what they meant by the tri-colored pencils and then when I got them, I saw that the pencils are triangular in style. They are very interesting and super easy to hold. These are just what I was looking for and work well with the Faber metallic pencils I just purchased.  The lead (or whatever it is) is soft yet doesn't break easily. The colors are vibrant and I can't get some beautiful sparkly accents with using these and the Faber metallic colored pencils and I don't need  to use a metallic gel pen. Each of the pencils offers a rich, intense color and when I use them with their matching metallic colored pencils I get a beautiful combination. I am hoping that these colors will give me more inspiration to work in my adult coloring books. Very excited to continue using these!	1
Turns out, the meaning of TRI-colour listed in the description means triangular in shape, and NOT 3 colors per pencil, as the definition of tri-color connotates!!! So, if you are looking for a pencil with 3 colors and not one single color per pencil, then do not get these!!! I wonder if they sell tri-color ink cartridges that are triangular!!! Because the wording of the item description is not correct and quite misleading, I am returning these pencils, as I have so many single colored pencils already...	-1
Love these pencils. They give a great color and will hold a sharp point. Really like them better that Prismacolor premiere.	1
I wanted soft lead colored pencils to use in adult coloring books. These have a triangular barrel designed to give a wider surface to grip and minimize slippage. I haven't used them enough yet to tell if this design is better or worse than any other; right now they just feel a little awkward in my hand. Haven't had to sharpen one yet; they are supposed to resist breakage & work in standard sharpeners according to the box info. The colors are nice & I am very happy this set includes a metallic looking gold & silver toned pencil. The colors apply smoothly & seem more richly pigmented that some of my others...I can't compare them to high end artist grade pencils however, just to brands frequently seen in many local stores. I'm pleased with these and consider them well worth the money. I think these are great for kids & adults or if you need to buy a larger quantity for a classroom. I do like the softer lead and would buy this exact set again in a heartbeat.	1
For the price these are the best budget pencil you can get your hands on. So if you're tri curious you should definitely get a pack of these or two if you're new to pencil art. They will suffice without breaking the bank, and you'll learn the basics of different applications and shading without losing money on the more expensive Prismacolor Scholors. These are fun grade pencils and while they go down thick and nice, keep in mind they have no light fast qualities so don't expose your work to sun.  I recommend these above all else for beginners and hobbyists who just need a cheap set of pencils to mess with. They are the best student grade on the market for the low price.  Enjoy!!!	1
These are great...decent coverage and rich colors.	1
Faber-Castell pencils even at the 'student' level have very nice quality. They blend and sharpen well, good color selection, are comfortable to hold.	1
Nice pencils. easy to use, sharpens great.	1
I purchased this Recipe Journal for a friend who was drooling over my Book Journal Moleskine.  The friend has been saving recipes and loves to cook, so just the thought of having such a beautiful book to place their loved recipes was awesome!  So, I bought it for her!  (Why not share Moleskine love, I say!)  When she got the book we opened it to find stickers for her recipes and lots of room to detail all the facts, ease of cooking, time to cook, etc.  She took it right home and started getting out her piles of magazines and began cataloging her favorites.  A GREAT gift for those chefs in your family/friends.  THERE'S NOTHIN' LIKE A MOLESKINE!	1
I bought this to have my daughter's grandmothers, aunts, or any other special people in her life write down family recipes in. The intention is that I'll give it to her someday as a gift for her wedding or other big life event. It seems like it'll work good for the purpose! I wish the page tabs weren't pre-stickered and that the pages were all structured the same for my purpose but still a nice journal!	1
Bought as a gift for my mom...she loves it!	1
I love this journal i am able to write up my fav recipes and keep them in one location. I do wish the ingredients area was a little larger. But I like the style and you can put a lot of detail. I'm enjoying filling mine out.	1
Love this journal.  I keep recipes on loose paper now I have a way to organize and comment on each.	1
I've been using this as my primary recipe journal for a couple of years now and for the most part have no complaints. It has some great information and features that some other journals wouldn't have.  The typical Moleskine strap helps keep miscellaneous notes stored in place inside, and an accordion pocket in the back helps with that as well. It comes with a couple of sticker sheets to allow you to mark off certain recipes with "love this!" or "what if..." or more. There's also a sticker sheet of categories that you can use for the pages with blank tabs ("My Favorites" or "Cooking Courses" or "Websites" or "Table Setting" or "Veggie/Vegan") but you can always write in whatever other categories you'd like instead (I've written in "Frosting" and "Miscellaneous" in mine but find the sticker idea clever and they have lots of options).  These blank tabs, however, leave something to be desired. As other reviewers have mentioned, they don't mimic the style of the pre-set categories with spaces for the recipe title, ingredients, preparation, how many it serves, difficulty of the recipe, etc. The extra tabs are just blank spaces with randomly spaced lines to separate ideas (which I just usually ignore anyway). Regardless, I'm glad they have blank space, because some of the pre-set categories (like "cocktails" for me) just don't get used, while I require a lot more space for things like types of frosting.  The front of the journal comes with a lot of cool information (though I can't admit I use it all that often) such as a calendar of when certain food products are in season (and there are even separate calendars for the Northern and Southern hemispheres). There are food facts (such as calories, carbs, protein, and fat in common foods) and a conversion chart.  One of the more cool parts that I hadn't even noticed until several months of using this journal is there's a mostly blank index in the back so you can fill in your recipe titles and have an easier way to find what pages things are on later.  Overall, this is a pretty great recipe journal. There are certain things that aren't necessarily perfected and could use improving, but they are all mostly minor and the pros most definitely outweigh the cons.	1
I must be living under a rock because I did not discover Moleskine until recently. I have several favorite recipes that I make each season so this is a great way to collect them all when I want to make them. It comes with stickers on the inside which I love. This would make a great bridal shower gift or make it even personal by filling it out with some of your favorites and giving it as a gift!	1
The moleskine Planner is perfect for those small hand me down and internet downloaded recipes. The cover is a black soft leather with glossy imprints fg kitchen utensils. A black back -attached elastic band easily holds the book together.  The beginning pages include useful things like a planning section with events/dates/notes column, a food harvest calender for the chart for the northern and southern hemisphere, A food fact chart charting common foods, amt of one serving, calories/carbs/protein and fat, a measurement and conversion page and a small separate booklet that translates between English, French, German, Italian, Korean (I think) and Spanish. The pages are very detailed, yet sparse. In the 8" x 5" journal, you only have about a three by four inch rectangle to right down the preparation instructions. Each page has a separate recipe heading, ingredient and preparation block, on the side there is a column that allows you to rate the difficulty (by coloring in any of the 5 empty circles), servings indicator (again choosing the 2/4/6/8 or ... circle choices), a place to write preparation time, cooking time, cooking process (with a picture and space for a microwave, oven and stove, wine pairings, notes, and rating (where you color in the 5 outline of stars).  The book is clearly divided by tabs - pre-labeled already by subjects such as Appetizers, First Courses, Main Dishes, Side Dishes, Desserts and Cocktails. The next section allows the user to choose 5 additional tabs, from the included sticker sheets or writing in their own. However, this option doesn't have the previous layout of pages, instead has rows of 4 by and inch and a half blocks to write or in my case, print and paste. There is an index in the back where you can print in your entree to the corresponding page number and a 2 part accordion folder to store recipes in.  This is perfect for food and wine lovers.	1
A nice looking book. Good way to keep recipes organized. I have so many recipes that they wouldn't all fit but I like using this to keep track of my favorites.	1
I bought this as a gift.  Was very happy with it.  My daughter love it.  She works as a Script Director and she will tweak this to record all the movies she works on.	1
As a culinary student and professional pastry cook, I think this book is great!  I will probably make up my own sections instead of using theirs since this will primarily be for the bakeshop.  I think the star rating will be great for me since the recipes here will be my own.  A few folks have commented on how little space they have for writing recipes.  Number one, it's a recipe, not The Great American Novel.  How much space do you really need?  Number two.  Okay, so you really do need that much space.  Well, why not cross-reference a page in a later section.  All of the pages are numbered.  On the bottom of the page you find so cramped, write in "continued page 123" and continue on page 123!  I don't mean to be (that) snarky, but it seems obvious especially when so many of these same people claim that the later sections seem to be useless.  In the later sections, I may write in different flavor options for ice cream or cookies, different garnishes or plating options, etc.  I don't see the point of copying all of my recipes that are already written into this book.  I do think this is great for anyone, chefs especially, who do any sort of menu development or recipe writing.  I LOVE the index.  That's too cool.  It will make it very easy to find information later.  My only complaint is the cocktail section.  I could do without it.  C'est la vie.  I'll most likely use it as another recipe section.  I bought three of these books and do not regret it.  I only wish I had found these before I started culinary school!	1
The 5" by 8", 240-page Film Journal notebook is part of Moleskine's Passions series that also include issues for Recipes, Wellness, Books, Wines and Music. We live in a world where not too many of us can find the time to write down their thoughts, with a pen and on paper but, again, the Moleskines aren't for everyone. To the extent that there are people who not only love to write but love to write specifically about the movies they watch, the Passions series Film Journal is a notebook dream come true. But, let's examine what one gets.  First and foremost this is a Moleskine, and it's very much true to its tradition of look, feel and quality. It comes with the traditional and most useful elastic band, nice cardboard binding that allows it to lie flat when opened without cracking the spine, excellent quality paper, rounded corners, THREE ribbon bookmarks and the 2-pocket mini accordion file inside the back cover.  Now, this being a Film Journal, it includes a listing of a few dozen major film festivals, sorted by continent and location, an event planner, personal tabbed pages under half a dozen tabs with preprinted tab stickers to be found inside the accordion file. The main section is, of course, the movie journal. Alphabetically organized, it provides one page per movie with sections for recording the movie's title, country and year, awards won, directors, actors, quotes, notes, opinion and rating. For a movie lover who loves to write, can't get much better than this.  I love this notebook for its quality make, its design and for its familiar look and feel. But I am repeating myself. It's a 5-star item without hesitation.	1
Still these don't fit the regular size bracelets either ! Good quality though , and I just put them on a chain , that's how small they are !	1
I love these black crystals. Brilliant shine. Beautiful when strung with the coral and yellow faceted beads I purchased at the same time. Very satisfied with this purchase.	1
These beads are top quality. If you use them in making jewelry or ANY project, they just gleem. I cannot find but clear crystals in a supermarket which has crafts, at all. These black beads are crystals. They are not colored medal, as I thought they might be when I ordered them. I know I use them on not just jewelry. If I need more, (if?) I know, now where to purchase them.	1
Does not fit pandora style bracelets. (see pictures) very pretty beads, great for use on thin bracelets. would recommend .	1
very good	1
Thank you for the timely delivery, i love my product	1
Very nice. Arrived as stated on time.	1
Excellent	1

Really nice quality for an excellent price....definitely would buy more.	1
Very nice spacer beads, well made. Adds elegance to any project!	1
great	1
These are so awesome with any color and with almost any kind of shape. They add the perfect amount of bling to anything.	1
Great quality and color!!  I would reorder them again.  I used them to make magnetic bracelets and rings.  Great price for the product that is received.	1
These are NOT Swarovski Crystals.  These "rhinestones" do not have the sharply cut facets that give Swarovski their shine.  They barely have any shine at all.  These are dull.  Some of the rhinestones are glued in crookedly or are loose.  The metal used to enclose the rhinestones is NOT Silver Plated;  It is cheap, lightweight metal (or it could be plastic).  I don't like being blatantly mislead like this.  It is just dishonest.	-1
These are quite nice for the low price. It took about 4 weeks to get them but I was not in a rush. I like them.	1
These crystals are a solid black, yet bright with a nice amount of sparkle!  The 8mm size works with a variety of pearl sizes. Shipment arrived as scheduled. Thanks!	1
I've been making a lot of red and black jewelry for football season and these look great!  It really makes my jewelry pieces look very high class.  Best price I've found for them!	1
Beautifully designed great sparkle	1
Have not decided on a design for thses yet.  Were slightly smaller than I was thinking they would be.  Have a nice sparle but not of the same quality of previous Swarovski's I have purchased.	1

Hands down, this is the most requested rondelle I use.  Makes a sparkly spacer between pearls, or other bead groups!  The size is wonderful.	1
these spaces were great quality and look great on my necklaces or accent any earrings you are making.  I will order these again	1
great	1
Beautiful and pretty in person	1
Prompt delivery & good description of product. Very pleased	1
beautiful and excellent price	1
Love them and just ordered again.  Took a month to get, but worth the wait.	1
Love them.....can't wait to make a bracelet	1
These are beautiful when used with black beads.  Swarovski never disappoints.	1
nice	1

Image washes off with first wash and I even followed directions precisely! Urghhh!	-1
Very good!	1
Works great  in printer. Transfers good	1
HP paper transfer Product and delivery good and received as described	1
Excellent and promptly service!!!	1
Excellent product, as pictured	1
Great transfers and easy to work with.	1
This is a good item. You will need to follow the instructions religiously for the best results. Lots of fun.	1
I had planned on using this to create one of a kind stuffed animals and dolls with some digital art I recently purchased. While the colors printed out more muted I was ok with that. I followed the instructions to the letter but once cooled the transfer started peeling up on the edges. Absolutely the whole set was ruined and a big waste of money!	-1
This item was reasonably priced and my students were able to design and print their own t-shirts.  It was a fun project and these worked well and made it very affordable	1
I was tricked by the positive reviews of this product. The transfer process is not easy whatsoever. I planned to come out of this having beautiful shirts, however the process left me feeling very agitated. It is not worth the time spent in the least.	-1
These worked flawlessly (well, one out of 36 didn't come out perfect) on white t-shirts. We used black ink only, printing from a HP inkjet. Each sheet (after printing) was cut into two, as we put a logo on the front and a quote on the back. Mine has only been washed once so far, but it looks the same.	1
This dye works great, I've made many many shirts with it and they haven't faded in the slightest. 5/5 stars.	1
The little kid comes out of me with this starter set.	1
Great, nothing more to say. This can create more than 5 shirts if necessary and the colors are gorgeous, I somehow even managed to create a light pink color with this dye. I don't know how but I loved it.	1
this was my 1st tie dye and it was tons of fun. i loved the colors and the instructions are very easy to follow. it says only 5 t shirts but i did a whole queen set of sheets and a couple t shirts. it was worth the money and i would buy it again too.	1
Nice product	1
Durable.  Good product.  I will. It again	1
Some people reviewed these biscuits and were dismayed that a few of them were a little tight (fat).  I did not find that there was any biscuits that were to fat to use.  I made up my mind that if I found any that were to fat that I would just touch them to my belt sander.  So far, none have been a problem.  Great price also.	1
I had one defective biscuit, the rest were perfect. I keep em in a ziplock bag to keep moisture away.	1
Porter Cable makes great biscuits! Make sure after you open the bag you place then in an air-tight container or they will swell on you. Here is a little trick if they don't fit, put them in the microwave for a very short time and they will shrink!	1
Its exactly what I requested, much cheaper than the big box stores, very good product.	1
It will take forever to go through all these biscuits!  They work fine and get the job done.  What else can one say?	1
If you keep these in water and humidity proof ziplock bags, they are fine.  About 95% have no problem, but quality control is a bit lacking and some bad ones are inevitable at this price.  All disks are made to absorb water and expand to form a very tight bond when coated with wood glue - that's part of what makes them work.  They come in non-resealable plastic bags and are fine when they arrive but if you use some and don't put the remainder in something water tight, they will expand and become too big to fit.  That's not just these, but ALL wood disks.  It would be great if they came in resealable containers, but they don't, so have some gallon size ziplocks on hand when you open them and don't get them wet.  Great value.	1
Love it. Hate cleaning oil based materials from brushes. This is my answer. Put 'em in a plastic resealable bag and it will last til the next day or so, if you seal the bag tight. Then, when finished, just throw away. Love 'em.	1
Very good quality.  Much better than the big box brush.	1
Jen Manufacturing Inc. 2 Poly Foam Brush (Pack Of 48) were just what my woodworker spouse and I needed for finishing projects or painting.  The angled head of the 2 brush makes it easy to use in small areas.  The wood handle is about 4 long and  in circumference.  I use these brushes for craft projects or when painting a room in the house to cut-in as necessary.  They work well for getting a smooth finish  no brush marks  when painting a toy or stepstool that we have made for the grandchildren.  Best of all, they are easy to wash and reuse several times.  At one-third the price of 2 foam brushes found in the big-box hardware stores  approximately 25 cents vs 79 cents - Jen Manufacturing Inc. 2 Poly Foam Brush (Pack Of 48) are a true bargain.  More surprising, these brushes are made in the USA.  You won't go wrong buying these 2 foam brushes on Amazon.	1
Awesome and amazing packaging!	1
I use these for all touch up painting; I like them.	1
Can't beat the price on these 2" brushes! Perfect for using oil based primer...just throw away the brush! These are also the most sturdy of any foam brush!	1
Very good quality foam brush. I have purchased several brands of craft foam brushes but they weren't very well made or sturdy. Recommended for paint, clear medium, gesso, art glue and other varieties of craft & art medium. Will be used for transfer medium, collage work, and acrylic designs. Recommended for crafters & artists who want a more sturdy brush.	1
no 2" wide 1 1/2" wide returned	-1
Happy with the quality and the price.	1
Excellent	1
These are great firm durable foam brushes. The bulk per item price can't be beat. I highly recommend Jen poly foam brushes. I have used them for paints and stains.	1
Very good quality foam brushes at a good bulk purchase price.  I now have enough for a few years .......... Yippee	1
These brushes work very well -- a previous batch of another brand gave me problems because the handles came off during use. These brushes, however, are OK and do the job. I would prefer plastic handles, but you can't have everything. Although they are only 1-inch these have plastic handles and offer a great buy! <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Darice-1-Inch-Foam-Brush-Value-pack-50-Piece/dp/B004GXBXGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Darice 1-Inch Foam Brush Value pack, 50-Piece</a>	1
These are the best built foam brushes I've used or seen.  I've used a variety of brands.  The foam is securely attached to the handle, the foam density excellent, and cut is straight and sharp.  They hold up compared to the others I've used.  Great value.  I also purchased the 3 inch.	1
These brushes were exactly what they were supposed to be. They are working extremely well for my dad and grandpa's woodworking projects. If you need them, these are where you should get them. Good value - good price for the quantity.	1
I'm just finishing a bookcase project.  I started using foam brushes from HD, only to have the heads of three of them snap off while applying the first coat of stain...and I wasn't brushing the surface very hard.  I switched to these brushes and haven't had a single problem since.  These are inexpensive enough to use once and discard, although I generally wash them out and get a couple of uses out of them.  Highly recommended.	1
This awl is perfect for several things. works great, is sturdy, and is small enough to pack around. I love it.	1
The point of the awl is what I'd expect - like any sharp tool, it needs occasional sharpening, and I have a more narrowly tapered awl for other purposes. There's something to be said for the tang of the awl going all the way through the handle. You see the same piece of steel at the top of the handle as at the working tip. If you drive the awl with a hammer, that might be just what you want.  But not what I want. I usually push the awl with the rounded top of the handle in the palm of my hand. So, when the wooden handle slides down the tang of the awl towards the tip, it pushes the back end of the steel rod uncomfortably into the palm of my hand. I haven't had problems with the ferrule coming loose, unlike some other reviewers. I kinda wish I did - that's easy to fix, unlike the loose handle.  If, like me, you usually push your awl by hand, you might prefer one where the tang goes only partway into the handle, not all the way through.  -- wiredweird	-1
This awl has the dumb secondary bevel on the tip (you can see the extra pointy bit on front) that makes it impossible to make gently tapered holes with this awl.  For that reason, I do not like this awl. It is a bad awl.  The secondary bevel provides you with 1/8" of usable tip before you plow this english bulldog straight throw your project on accident.  Skip this awl, there are better ones at similar price points.	-1
Arrived as expected and excellent product.	1
Standard OEM awl made by Stanley.	1
Excellent product	1
not the greatest quality but ok for what I paid.	-1
Good.	1
Got the job done	1
Works great.	1
use it to make travelers notebook. works well.	1
good price. If you don't haven electric drill, an awl is great for starting a hole to screw something in.	1
Does what it is supposed to do. Has held up very nicely. VERY SHARP!Would have been nice if it came with some kind of cap or some protection for accident prone people like myself, but you can't always get what you wantlol. I would recommend.	1
Great product from a trusted name. Very happy.	1
Just what I needed for work!  Fits nice in the palm of your hand, reduces stress and blisters from using a screwdriver.	1
Sharp and stout, works very well.	1
I bought this because I just needed something that had a pointed nail like end to poke holes into stuff like plastic plantar growing wheatgrass, just a cool item to have on hand and love the wood handle.	1
Great tool for a good price	1
Scratches wood and leather just fine.	1
Works like it should	1
Great awl, and comes with a pretty well defined tip. Did sharpen it a little, since it was tearing and not scribing, but other  that, it's a great deal at a low price.	1
Just what I needed.	1
This is fine for a basic scratch awl. I haven't had this one very long but so far it works fine. My biggest concern is how long the "spike" will stay set in the handle. Time will tell.	1
Good and sharp. The grip is fairly comfortable. It allowed me to punch holes for hand binding two books fairly quick and easy with minmal wear on my dainty lady hands.	1
good product, great price	1
Timely delivery, and was as expected.	1
This awl is a nice heavy duty awl for it's size. I got it to be one of the tools in my beading arsenal.	1
While scratch awls are typically used to make accurate markings (and this one is certainly good for that), I used mine to punch holes in a steel roof. A great tool: sturdy, nice weight, and with the wooden handle is a bit old fashioned in the best possible way.	1
The Stanley Scratch Awl is well made and perfectly functional. I am very pleased to have it in my tool kit.	1
This works beautifully for cutting out stencils to use with my airbrush.	1
I am using this to make christmas ornaments on wooden disks.  The only complaint I have is the finest tip is not holding up very well.  I will have to replace it only 15 ornaments in .  Overall it's a great tool but does get very hot so watch your fingers and be sure to put something under the stand as it gets VERY hot.	1
This is a good multi-purpose tool, but it needs some directions. I burned myself when I first used it looking for an on/off switch, only to find it was already hot! Figuring out how to put the cutting blade on was not easy, either. A directory of the different heads and what they do would also be helpful. As I am learning how to use it, I like it.	1
good	1
Awesome product	1
perfect for all my crafting needs!	1
This is a nice crafting tool for small projects.  I bought it to seal ribbon ends for making bows.  The soldering tip does the job for me.  Whats in the box: 1 - Base (the Dremel 1550 Tool) 1 - Stand 1 - Universal Wood-burning/Leather Crafting Tip 1 - Script Wood-burning/Leather Crafting Tip 1 - Soldering Tip 1 - Knife Tip 1 - Fine Stencil Cutting/Wood-burning/Leather Crafting Tip  There are no directions in the packaging, however for my needs, it was easy to determine which tip fit the bill.  The tips heat up super quickly, and maintain an even heat. It works well and i love that it has a little stand that I can rest the tool on so the tool doesn't roll around when not in use.  Overall if you craft, this is an essential tool you will need for a multitude of little projects!	1
Works great	1
I use this tool to burned	1
Worked great	1
It's good.  No problems.	1
Did not came as advertised, the most important piece (the one I was looking to use) was the blade support one for the exacto knife, so I never used this one.	-1
I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I was hoping to be able to create stencils using this dremel. Unfortunately,  it only "charred" the stencil and the versa tip turned black & began smudging everywhere. As of now it's sitting on a shelf collecting dust. I would not recommend this dremel to anyone.	-1
good tool, enough for my small projects	1
Learning to use it to do webbing	1
Just as expected.	1
It worked great. The razor blade attachment was what I really wanted, but it is made of brass. When it got too hot it bent and broke. I have to get a now one.	1
Great	1
Shipping fast, order as described.  Compared this to others and other suppliers and this price is great.  Christmas present which hasn't been used yet, so detailed evaluation unavailable.	1
I love my Dremel burner. I messed up and bought the cheapest burner i could find first to see if i liked pyography and it was broken after 2nd project, could have been user error. Then I bought the Dremel and it was a big difference in the heat and comfort for my hand. It was easy to work with and didn't leave my hands cramped or feeling extremly sunburned like the cheaper one did. It totally changed what I was able to do and made it so much easier. The tips are quality tips too. Also, an extra plus is that I sold the first project I did with this burner and it turned out great, best of the gourds I have been burning. I got an offer and actually hated to see it go.	1
This tool seems plenty strong enough to me because I don't push the tool to work faster than how it was intended. I bought this so I could cut nylon without fraying, and it works well with a little practice. Gets extremely hot.	1
Does work well as a hot knife but loses heat rapidly if used on anything more than thin sheets. Attempted to cut a 1/16" thick Plexiglass sheet and found no go. Not sure about the temperature claim of 1050 degrees F Used a infrared surface temp thermometer and was able to register only  400 F on the tip after 15 minutes.  However it does seem sufficient for cutting ropes or nylon cords. No doubt will work on stencils.	1
I just started playing around with soldering and wood burning and this thing is awesome. Good price for a product with multiple tips and even beginner instructions included. I recommend for anyone wanting to try wood burning.	1
can carve into wood leather wax all kinds.  I love Dremel.  i am using these to create and draw designs in leather.  also burns holes.  Very cool tool	1
I don't use it much, but it does what it is designed to do. I wish there were a wider assortment of tips. I had to make some different ones for my specific purpose.	1
No directions for which tip to use. Do not buy - it is junk. I used it for  1/2 hr burned up one tip then replaced it and burned up another during soldering. I am sending it back to manufacturer.	-1
I got this wood burner specifically to burn a logo onto a board, for the front of a display. It worked great. Very hot. Turn it on, give it a bit to warm up... then go!  It will also cut plastic and do soldering tasks, so it's not an tool that is good for only one thing. This is a nice addition to my tool box!  It works well, has many uses, and is sold at a good price; what's not to like!	1
I like it because it's hotter than most woodburning kits.  I would like to have an even hotter one, but this one is good and I use it a lot.	1
Versitile tool.  Really comes in handy to seal webbing.  Love the extra attachments that came with the unit.  Trying other crafting ideas with it.	1
xmas present to I do not know how the person will like it, it was something that was different, and I know that he is into work carving so I through that this could be used to embellish the items	1
Good maximum heat, well constructed, stable tips, and accepts a wide variety of tips. The double heat sink helps keep the tool in place while on a base; I've had previous ones by other manufacturers slide right off.	1
Great Product for wood Carving Projects,  I would like to know where I can buy more Dremel Tips-  It is well worth the Money. I am planing to buy another one.	1
This is a great burner especially for the price.  I use it to burn letters I have carved in signs and name plates and it does a great job, stays hot at all times.  Darrell, NE	1
I am a professional wood artist (you can check me out at deviantart.com under my username johnlewisbrooks) and I must say I REALLY like this! I bought the 28pc set which gives a woodburner almost all the tools you'd ever need to work on a project!  The tip takes about 5 minutes to heat up, very similar to an iron if you ask me, so it's only a matter of a little patience. Lastly, BE CAREFUL! This is a serious tool, not a toy for a young kid! The heat is near 1,000 degrees!	1
Once I was able to find a screwdriver to put the bit in I loved it. It is easy to use, writes like a pen. Can't wait to try my etching bits with it.	1
Works very well.  Using it to identify belongings my daughter is taking to the dorms.	1
New I haven't tried this yet.	1
love this it works so well.	1
Exactly what I needed. LOUD, but works great and is small enough it doesn't feel clumsy in my hand.	1
love my dremel	1
tools love it	1
Does a great job but is a bit noisy.	1
This was a gift and I was told that it was superior in its build and use.	1
To stinking loud.	-1
The bit was not attached and so I haven't been able to use it because it requires tools to put the bit into the dremel.  A waste of my time.  It should have come ready to go or with the tool needed to make it work.  You need a very tiny flat head screw driver.  Almost like the ines in the eyeglass repair kit.  Which I don't have.  Still sitting on the shelf in the packaging for the last 2 months.	-1
Perfect for the job.	1
Good product; happy with purchase.	1
Nice product. work good. recommend	1
A fun and creative tool.	1
It's okay, just wasn't good for the project I was working on	1
Great little tool. Powerful and effective in etching and egg blowing crafts. I did buy additional drill heads to make this more universally applicable to my craft needs. Holding the drill and turning it on and off are difficult while multi-tasking in craft work so I cannot give it 5 stars. Also, it is difficult to adjust the changing drill heads due to the very deep and small screw that is the sole means of holding the drill heads in place. A good starter tool for craft jobs.	1
Love this little tool. So many uses!	1
Looks like a good set	1
Excellent engraving device for class, would and metal.	1
I love this dremel Fits my hand so easy to use Highly recommend	1
VERY GOOD	1
doesnt fit hand well which throws off lettering.	-1
Parts missing	-1
My bit wasn't included.  I tried to open up the area to put the bit, thinking it was hiding there, but no bit :(	-1
Tried and tried to unscrew it, so could put a blade into it.  Never could, so gave up.  And then just got a small hand held one that works even better.  Also looked cheaply made.	-1
I have used the Dremel only once, but I tried to mark an antique hammer head, and it mostly skipped around! I thought you were supposed to be able to write with it. Maybe I don't have the nack yet! Will try the diamond tip I also ordered. This is a work in progress!	-1
This little item fell apart before I even used it.  The metal collar piece ( attached at the wood neck) fell off as I removed it from the package.  Guess I shall drive the 32 miles to the nearest Harbor Freight and get one tomorrow.  I do not recommend this product.	-1
This awl is a piece of s***. Don't buy it and don't be lured by the add-on deal. First of all, if you're using it to poke holes in metal (like hammering the top area lightly) the pointy end flattens immediately. The shiny metal you see is just a cheap coating and started chipping off immediately as well. Then, the metal cusp thing that's connected to the wooden head is cheap, after gripping the awl for a couple minutes the cheap glue connecting it to the wood came apart and the metal cusp fell off. Don't buy this piece of s*** awl, please. I'm trying to return mine.	-1
What I received is not the same as what is pictured. This is what you will get... http://www.amazon.com/General-Tools-Scratch-Overall-Length/dp/B002YDTIXG/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1418925726&sr=8-5&keywords=awl+818#productDetails  Very blunt end and thick.	-1
I did not like this awl, it really is not for book making you can use it to make holes in a belt but not for making books.	-1
I recently bought these water mixable oils and I'm sorry to say they are awful. I have always painted in oils, but hadn't painted in quite a few years so I bought fresh ones. I figured as long as I was buying new paints I might as well try these since they seemed like they would be way less toxic and smelly. Let me just say these paints are not good. At all. The first time I used them I hated what I painted and blamed it on being rusty since I hadn't painted in so long. Well, I just tried to paint with them again tonight and it's definitely not me. They are nearly impossible to mix (I tried the correct medium and tried plain water, both resulted in gloppy paint that never fully mixed), so if you can't get them to mix properly you can just imagine how hard they are to control on a canvas; you can't control them. Maybe if you are a super abstract artist who prefers gloppy, thick paint these will work for you, but I need my paint to be very smooth and easy to control. I'm so mad that I wasted my money on these.	-1
not real oil paint..	-1
They are ok but is hard to really know the colors pigments are really dark not my favorite palette	-1
This is a complete disappointment! I'm an artist whom likes to do paint-by-numbers to relax. This... was not relaxing. It was aggravating and infuriating.  This didn't get one star because the picture is so beautiful.  The paint is pretty much see through and the numbers are printed in a very deep blue ink that's very hard to cover up. I have some pictures shown. The green is two coats and you can still see the numbers. The cream was, believe it or not, four coats!! Yes, you can still see the numbers!! How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop?!  Right now, I'm at the point where I'm either just going to throw it away with nothing done on it, or I'm going to get out my other paints and see if I can get the numbers covered and use my own coloring. If i Do that, I will post a follow-up picture. I'm not sure any paint will cover up the numbers with one coat. Gesso maybe. But I would hate to Gesso then paint. Seems to be a lot of unnecessary stress for such a cheap paint-by-number.  If you want to do a paint-by-number that is wonderful with paint and coverage pay a little more and go with the Dimensions brand. I've done several of those and reviewed them as well.	-1
This is the second review I've written about a PBN by Reeves company. I love the picture, but so far I have had to buy 4 replacements paints at the hobby store, because the paints were so thin they didn't come close to covering the mat and they separated as I stroked them on. Also the paint board is an odd size 15 3/4 by 11 3/4  and there are no frames to match it. I can either buy a custom frame on EBay that will cost me 2times the original cost of the PBN or I can cut the board down and lose a lot of the picture to fit into an 11x14 frame. I had to do this on my other picture and it really took away from the painting. At this point I may not finish it, as I see I need another replacement paint. ( I have been buying Ceramcoat in 2 oz. .bottles) Buyer Beware.	-1
This really was the pits, not only did I run out of paint but mixing them didn't match what was on the picture.  I had to use other paint from the Plaid kit I already done to help fill the void.  Do not buy this Reeves painting or any other from Reeves.  Also half the lines showing what to paint were so light you couldn't tell where to paint.	-1
The painting itself was off so you can't read what numbers should be at the edges The paint is dried out and old The paints where half or less then half way full so there is not enough paint to finish the painting. I am so disappointed it's costing me $16.00 for just paint to paint this I wish I could just get a refund :(	-1
I'm happy with the colors but the palette is useless as the little plastic dividers that hold the pans in place are bent.  They would fit fine if the pans came unpackaged but they came wrapped in cellophane and had a paper wrapper around the outside as well.  This added bulk to each pan and the pans were placed in the palette with the dividers, hence the dividers bent to accommodate the extra bulk of the pans.  I ordered this and another palette (same thing but with full sized pans) and encountered the same problem.  It makes the fit for the dividers/pans pretty crappy and useless as it doesn't hold the pans in very well.  I just bought a sturdy metal palette to put my pans in to avoid this crap.  Also, even with the dividers that aren't bent, the pans do not stay in the palette very well.	-1
I wanted to love this pocket set of watercolors. I had a smaller pocket sketch set from W&N, but wanted the option of more colors. Unfortunately- this set is nothing like the smaller pocket sketch set. The paint pans do not stay in place. The plastic that is supposed to hold it is flimsy and arrived bent. If the kit gets bumped in your sketch bag, the paints can easily become dislodged. Not to mention if you are holding the kit while sketching in the field, and you accidentally drop it- the paints will go flying!	-1
Looks like it will be convenient but it is hard to open and close.	-1
I didn't like it koi watercolour is way beTTER	-1
Disapointed!!! I bought 2 based on reviews and reputation of the company and it was one of the worst watercolor art supply purchase so far. The color are so diluted with cheap fillers. I ended up using 1/4 of the pan just to get a decent depth of color for a wash and it was still light. The ugly graininess was super frustrating too. The cadmium yellow was like more light lemon yellow. This set may be cheap but not a value since I would go through it in 3 paintings. If I had used this when learning to watercolor painting I would have gave up. I would not recommend this to anyone! You cant give it to a child either because the colors are toxic.	-1

i thought this looked like the perfect way to get some fairly good quality watercolors in a very small, watertight case.  i don't like most of the colors and the pans are so small you'd need to use a size 0 brush to use in this box without mixing one pan with it's neighbors. that ruined it for me.  but the very worst thing is how difficult it is to open the case. i thought it was broken at first, because i had to use so much force to open it. i ended up hurting my fingers when i kept trying to open it.  who wants to use a product that hurts them?!	-1
This product is all good and well, the colors are vibrant and it forces you to make your own shades which is something I quite enjoy. But it took forever to get to my home.	-1
The package was open and one broken	-1
OVERPRICED!!! I only bought it b/c I couldn't get to the store. Plus two crayons were broken and the box was dirty.	-1
I bought this for my hubby who just got into coloring. He was disappointed with the lack of pigment. He remember when they had strong, bright, colors which they haven't had for years. He switched to markers now.	-1
Really disappointed in the overall quality of sets I received. I bought this thinking to use the best on my window film installations. Problems : 1) Zipper on the case is very rough to close, sticking. 2) the #2 handle requires a crazy amount of force to lock the blade in place and even then becomes loose making it unusable. 3) Some of the blades are not sharp as I would expect, beings it's a new kit. Sent this one back, the replacement set came brand new, sealed in plastic/cardboard... without the #2 holder with blade even in it. Other extra blades were not in place, bounced around. Sent back again. I cannot recommend this product due to such poor quality control.	-1
I am very unhappy with the "wood" box that this comes in. It is beyond cheap. It's like molded sawdust. There is no way the hinges will stay inside this crap material for long. I will be returning this and getting the same kit that comes in a zippered bag of sorts. It looks better and has to be better than this darn box. The plastic inserts holding the pens and blades is ridiculously tight. I had to pry the knives out with a screwdriver. Just things to think about if you ever use this regularly. Great set, just in a horrible box...	-1
The CHEAPEST CHINESE JUNK I've ever seen.  X-Acto has dropped from a quality hobby tool provider to knock-off junk. The tools aren't the same as the pic - many are coated in black "paint" to cover up their low quality, and the "wooden" storage box is cheap pressboard with a paper thin veneer coating.  I will NEVER buy anything X-Acto again. You're better off buying the copy versions of these knives - They are actually better quality than the so-called "X-Acto brand".	-1
Horrible carrying case.  Cheap thin plastic single blade slots give you no place to store bulk blades. X-Acto is an iconic brand that I used to associate with quality but the last three products I bought from them are junk.	-1
Too much of a toy - recovered my money easily by selling it on Craig's List	-1
Wouldn't recommend	-1
Like a previous reviewer said about it being from x-acto. I thought it would be half decent but these chisels are not that sharp at all. I tried to carv and cut into the softest piece of wood I had and it struggled to even dig in. Very disappointing coming from X-acto. I am going to try and sharpen these and hope for the best.	-1
The regular Xacto handles and blades are fine but the wood cutting tools are poorly made and not worthy of purchase and this set was sent back for a refund.	-1
The blades themselves are fine but the box is pretty terrible.  The black plastic inserts are not securely affixed and despite lots of attempts to wedge them into place, the flimsy plastic keeps falling out over and over again.  There's a magnetic insert in the plastic part that's supposed to keep the blades in but that falls out too.  So the blades always kind of end up loose and tumbling out...?  I'd be very embarrassed to give it as a gift.	-1
I can deal with the handles, but the factory edge is worthless. The burr on some edges makes it feel like carving with a spoon, not a knife. The bevel, such as it is, is so deeply corrugated by the 40-grit wheel that apparently sharpened it that I'll have to grind a lot off to get a truly straight edge on anything.  And then, I'll be down to the steel itself, and how it holds its edge - or doesn't, my hopes aren't up. I should have been more patient and waited for USPS to bring me a decent set of tools. But noooh, I wanted it right away. Serves me right.  -- wiredweird	-1
would have been nice if it had come complete....the red handled knife was missing the piece that holds the blade in place.it is a half-circle in shape and screws onto the metal at the top of the knife  do i have to return the entire kit?	-1
I BOUGHT 1 SIMILAR IN A DOLLAR STORE. SO U KNOW HOW MUCH I PAID. THE ONLY DIFFERENT IS THE CASE. MINE WAS PLASTIC. IF U WANT A GOOD KNIFE GO TO HOMDEPOT. THAT ONE IS WORTH IT. I TESTED THEM AND THE ONE FROM HOMEDEPOT WAS ALOT BETTER MADE. U JUST NEED TO BUY XTRA KNIFE FOR $1.00.	-1
So not worth it. I regret this buy. I would get something else if I could do it over again.	-1
I bought these and an 8x8 memory book at the same time. These were supposedly refills for the book I bought. They are about 1/2 inch smaller then those that came in the book. So useless. Didn't return them because I'll find something else to do with them.	-1
these did not work at all.  after application and ironing, they left a pattern on the fabric from decal not attaching fully or properly to the fabric.  tried all the sheets, no luck with any.  save your money, don't purchase	-1
There are a couple things one needs to know before purchasing these. First thing is the back is very hard to remove after applying the iron. I've had mixed results with these papers. Some turned out good. Some terrible. The paper backing is very hard to remove after ironing on the transfer. I followed the instructions exactly and still had trouble every time. I found wetting the paper a little helps rub down to where the backing can eventually be pulled off but that process is very messy, time consuming and still may not work. Third is the background of these papers are white. If you plan on transferring letters to a colored piece of fabric the white background will be behind them unless you cut each letter out separately.  I've noticed that Cricut and silhouette sell printable iron-on transfer papers. I'm going to try them next time. If you find something that works well stick with it and avoid these. These are a hassle and give mixed results at best. In my opinion they are only good as a last resort. As a matter of fact I had better results with the Iron-ons that Avery makes for dark colored fabrics. I would try those on light colored fabrics before I'd use these again.	-1
I've never used this brand before bit thought I'd give it a try. MISTAKE!! Not even a hour after wearing, it started to peel, I plan on trashing the rest so I don't waste any more shirts.	-1
What a mess	-1
I wanted to use these to make shirts with my Logo on them for my husband and I for when I do craft shows.  FAIL. big time.  I followed the instructions and even printed off a page to practice on a piece of fabric (The 4x4" piece worked WONDERFULLY) So I tried my full page logo. Read the instructions one more time just for good measure, noting that ironing time for a full page should take about 3 minutes. An hour and a half later, I'm still struggling to get an edge, any edge, of the paper to peel off of the plasticy stuff that the transfer is made out of. I finally get one edge to peel off and the transfer tears in the middle. I carefully place the bit that tore back on the shirt and iron over it again. Finally success! sort of. the edges that I painstakingly ironed with all of my weight against it are still peeling and frayed. My 2 shirts are currently in the wash, by themselves, on cold and I'm not expecting much when they come out.	-1
Does not print very well. I ordered 2 because you only get 5 per package. Expensive for what you get especially with the poor quality. I have a high end printer so I know that is not the issue. I will not order again.	-1
No matter what colors I print on these the result ends up turning really yellow after ironing.	-1
Wasted several shirts with this product. Followed directions and put heavy pressure on the print. Didnt matter, it peeled up and cracked after one wash. Dont bother. And If you have a shirt that looks okay its still subpar and people can tell you did it yourself.	-1
I've tried using this product twice now and I had trouble getting the release paper off and made a big mess. The small size like this apparently came with the wrong instructions but the instructions with this larger size wasn't a whole lot better. I had no luck with it maybe it's my iron but I'm giving up trying maybe you will have better luck then me.	-1
I was very disappointed in the condition in which the crayons were delivered.	-1
The Velcro is very strong. But the adhesive on the back-side is not. So you end up ripping the entire thing off. It defeats the purpose.	-1
I am an art teacher so I am familiar with various brands of paper.  I have Tru-Ray Pacon in my classroom already and was expecting the same quality. IT WAS NOT!  The paper was already faded and flimsy.  I bought red and blue for a specific project in school colors but these are all going in the recycle bin.  This paper was an add-on at a very low price and now I know why.  Proceed with caution.	-1
I ended up returning this. The picture is very misleading. This paper is SO much longer than customers are led to believe. Not only that, it is super flimsy. I was not thrilled with both the quality nor the size.	-1
This paper is a lot thinner than I expected. I was planning to try to do paper flooring with this, however, the paper is too thin and see through. And since it is white there is no contrast between sheets of paper. Actually, because it is so thin, when you overlap it looks horrible because its much whiter in the spots that overlap. You would have to make sure the flooring underneath is white as to not have this happen, but then you won't see any variations at all which makes it pointless. You mine as well just use white floor paint and call it a day.  All aside, as mentioned, the paper is somewhat see through. I cant imagine using this for too much else, other than for scrap paper for spray painting objects on, wrapping things / packages, etc....but isn't that what news paper is for?	-1
I ordered this paper as a backing for a school tree project.  I do love the color - it's a rich purple color - however the weight of the paper is rather wimpy.  When I googled the product, it was described as heavyweight.  I'm time bound to use this paper, but if I had a more leisurely project timeframe, I would have returned it.	-1
these do not miss well nor do they move on the paper to blend.	-1
worse than cheap kindergarten crayons	-1
I gave these markers two stars, because they are way too saturated for me and don't have a fine tip which is something I need. I ended up giving them away to someone who makes posters. I can see where the saturation would be good for posters. I've settled on the Copic markers because they are good for layering, shadowing and painting people. Prismacolor makes good quality art supplies, and I own a large assortment of their colored pencils. These saturated markers might be what you're looking for but they're not for me.	-1
Streaks.  Some pens didn't want to work at all.  I was unhappily surprised.  Colors spread over lines.	-1

They dry out rather quickly... I only had 4 posters to do and one of each of three colors was already drying out and two of the blacks I couldn't use.	-1
Was so excited to get these markers but they bleed horribly even through 100lb paper.  Wish these would have worked but out had to return.  :(	-1
First these are not really washable markers. They say on the packkage that they will not wash off walls or clothing. They will only wash off whiteboards or other similiar 'washable' surfaces and skin. But worse than that is the crayons just fall apart. When you try to sharpen them they just crumble. If you peel back the paper, they just fall apart. And the colors do not show up well on the included board. This is a really bad product.	-1
You can buy these for 1 at the 99 cent store. don't buy it.	-1
Works on colored pencils but not good for gel pens or markers. Was disappointed.	-1
I hate pink erasers, they don't work, but they were on my son's school supply list.	-1
These erasers are terrible.  They leave behind marks, streak dirt and make eraser crumbs.  Sometimes they even tear the paper.  You would almost be better off spitting on your finger and trying to rub away your mistakes. I couldn't understand why this product had so many stars, so scrolled through and realized all of the 5 star reviews are a few years old.  I'm not sure why they changed the product, but these are awful.	-1
WORST ERASER EVER. It leaves mark in the paper.... but not any usual mark as other eraser, it leaves the paper dirty. I don't recommend it at all. The quality is poor, when you use pieces of the eraser starts to break and it's really messy. My pencil eraser is 10,000 better.	-1
These scissors are NOT 8" long, they are a whopping 10" long. The only reason I bought them was because it said they are eight inches long. The old Fiskars scissors I have are 8" long and look like the small 5" precision scissors. I wish Fiskars would bring that style back. These scissors are made for someone who is standing and cutting, not someone who is sitting and cutting and they are TOO LONG. It puts the wrist at an awkward bend and irritates the tendinitis in my hand and wrist. I am highly disappointed in these scissors.	-1
These were bought for me as I make a lot greeting cards and paper crafts. My family thought they would be easier for me since I have a badly arthritic thumb and wrist on my dominate hand. After the first hour of having to lean against the table and use my other hand to push the scissor closed the pain the plastic handle fell off of the handle! It just broke. More cheap crap from China. My hand was hurting more than before.  I called Fiskars about the broken plastic and was told they shouldn't have done that. No kidding?  I gave the replacement piece and the scissors to my son who is the only one strong enough to shut those scissors! I now use loop scissor that are very sharp and causes no pain to my hand. I bought them at Arthritis Supplies dot com, just search under Around the House/Office Aids for Loop Handle Scissors and you'll find the best pair of scissors for arthritic hands before and after surgery.	-1
the scissors work well but the do not stay locked at all, open up as soon as you set the lock on them, so that leaves the blades open all the time and not safe.	-1
I am surprised about these scissor, from all the good reviews.  They are big and bulky, and not good for precision cutting of paper at all.  And it makes my hand hurt to use them unless you do small cuts a million times, and that takes forever to cut something out.  Must be good for someone else but not for me.  I am an art teacher and am cutting things out frequently, especially around holiday time.	-1
I bought these based on reviews, but they were kind of a waste of money. When they work, they're great. However, the paint inside is corrosive and eats through plastic and acrylic which limits what I can do with them. The pens themselves don't flow well, I had to resort to dumping the paint on a plate and dipping the pen in, quill and ink style. A few pens randomly lost the tip and dumped paint all over my project, which was a real bummer. I definitely won't be buying again.	-1
These are terrible paint markers.  If you push, just a little to hard, the paint comes pouring out.  I have had to remove globs of paint and restart my project.  No matter how careful I am every now and then I push a tad to hard and have a ruined piece.  I would not recommend these to anyone. I will not be buying this brand of paint marker again!	-1

These oil pastels are very smooth and waxy.  They're very cheap and work fine for sketches. Not for a serious work.  The case came with one of the containers missing. Maybe it's a returned item. They should ship a brand new item if they advertised it as a new product.	-1
I hated these. They don't blend with water and are very oily/messy. I gave them to my kids and bought the Prima brand instead which I LOVE!	-1
Only good as beginner student grade,  not really all that water soluble	-1
Good fun but not pro quality in my opinion. The crayola look is not pleasing.	-1
ergonomic design doesn't perform the same as it promised, 1. hard plastic handle and sharp edges at where the fingers contact to when cutting stuff 2. the relative position of the two holes is bad. There is no way to put only three fingers in the larger hole to make cuttings, but there is no room for four fingers in the hole either. 3. it is very lightweight, but I have to use more energy to open this scissors  Pro: 1. lightweight 2. making crisp cutting edge on fabrics 3. inexpensive	-1
I thought it was time for new scissors around my house so I got these.  I was mostly disappointed.  They aren't comfortable to use, they don't cut well and they were not near as good as the ones I got them to replace.  So I kept my old scissors and tossed these into the recycle.	-1
My previous pair of Fiskars held up wonderfully for years!  This new pair was very sharp and worked well for a couple of months.  Now they are dull and feel like they are about to fall apart.  WHAT HAPPENED?  Was the company purchased by someone else?  Are they under new management?  Whatever they did, they seem to be in the "disposable scissor" business.	-1
In this pack you get 8 crayons of various skin colors.  There's really nothing magical going on here except that they've grouped together the various colors from a regular crayon box that might be used for skin tones into this mini pack.  It's not a good value.  You might as well just buy a regular 64-crayon box, which will include these 8 colors anyway.	-1
While I usually love prisma colored pencils for their rich lay down of bright and beautiful colors, the lead in this pencil was off center. The lead broke so many times while sharpening that it was 3/4 of the way through with in a week! I'm beginning to become discouraged with prisma color since they started producing out of Mexico and have started to use polychromos by Faber castell instead. Hopefully they regain some of their quality control and fix this issue.	-1
The color of the real item is dull and dingy. Not at all what the picture looks like. I expected soft pastel colors. Yuck.	-1
Very disappointed. This is one of my most needed pencils and the first time I sharpened it, it cracked down the middle. Was not worth $10. I am so upset I just wasted my money and now my artwork will be behind.	-1
The yarn colors are not as shown in the item photo which shows rainbow as having 5 different colors (including blue), and what I actually received had no blue at all ... and way too much green.  UPDATE:  I looked this yarn up on the yarnspirations web site and found the example photo to not contain any blue.  from now on, before I order yarn, I'm double checking the color example's provided on amazon.  I know it hardly seems fair to rate the actual product by a photo description mistake, but the rating is a reflection of my disappointment in what I received compared to what I thought I was ordering.  if I had been able to see the correct product color photo, I wouldn't have ordered it.  for anyone ordering the "rainbow" yarn from amazon, just know there is no blue in it ... the photo is wrong.  it's just lilac, pink, yellow, and bright green (absolutely no blue!).  I double checked the color photo of the "pretty pastels" with the yarnspirations site and it is the same, so I went ahead and ordered the pretty pastels.  in a "rainbow" i expect a little green. lol  but I'm pretty sure i'll also get the blue, this time, too.	-1
$4.80!!  This is about 250% of what you'd pay by running down to the art store or even ordering online from an art store.  Holy moly.  (GREAT pencils though.)	-1
Construction paper is a lot heavier than this. This product isn't even like card stock. It is very.........flimsy. I will have to tape several pieces together to get the sturdiness I need. I can not tell if there is a weight size, but when I buy construction paper from the store, it is a lot heavier than this. It is not worth the trouble to send it back. I do not recommend this for people looking for construction paper. This is like regular paper that is colored.	-1
About a third of the sheets are warped; looks like water damage. Not too pleased.	-1
This works fine, but it is REALLY light! When I was using this and I put it down, it tipped to the side so the hot tip was on my desk. I had to use a heavy roll of tape to keep it from going over. So just beware when you are buying this, it works just fine, but it's not very sturdy.	-1
THESE ARE THE WORST foam brushes I have EVER USED.  The dollar store foam brushes at least work for one use.  the only support is the plastic tip.  you can't use the foam bursh in any functional capacity.  VERY DISAPPOINTED !	-1
If I could leave 0 stars I would do so. Yes, these brushes come at a cheap price, but they are so cheaply made that it took 3 brushes to complete a single piece of wooden trim that measured 8ft long and 3in wide. I was using polyshade stain, and it literally took 3 brushes!!! Really... in the end, it costs more to use them!	-1
Does not cut, dull as crap!	-1
loosens when you least expect it. Spend more time tightening it than cutting with it.	-1
Could not tighten enough to keep the blade in place.  Al threads eventually stripped and one unit is ruined.  Do not know if I will use the other.  Definately NOT to the standard I expect from X-Acto.	-1
Very dissatisfied. Recieved on time and first time i went to change blades the mechanism stripped. This was one of my worst purchases I have ever made. The quality is very poor. If you want a knife you only want to use once and throw away this is the product for you. I was looking forward to the soft grip but i intended to use it more than once. I wouldn't recomend this to anyone whom uses it frequently. I mean more than once as you cant change the blade.	-1
I guess you get what you pay for.  These fell apart within minutes (sometimes seconds) and didn't hold up well enough to do the job I purchased them for.  Lesson learned.	-1
I do not like the magnet feature of my machine at all.  It gets crumpled and twisted and ends up ruining your item, or wasting way too much magnet and laminate material.  Perhaps I'm just not experienced enough with it yet, but so far I just don't like it at all.	-1
Wasted more than we used. Doesn't last long and very expensive.	-1
I expected for the magnet coming off automatically, instead you have to fussy cut.	-1
I had tried the little rubber adhesive backed feet and the sandpaper dots, but I was still searching for the perfect solution to the slippery backs of the quilting rulers. For me, this doesn't seem to be it. In a class I took 2 or 3 years ago our instructor told us about this product and how wonderful it is. I bought two packages to make sure I had enough to cover the backs of all my rulers--I have more rulers than I really need. The application didn't go quite as smoothly as the instructions indicated. It just didn't want to stick to some of the rulers (all of which were the same Omnigrid brand). It is supposed to work on the principle of static cling, I guess, but I ended up having to dampen some of the rulers to make this product stick. There is no adhesive involved. This is a plus when it comes to removal if you decide not to keep it on your rulers--no sticky backs--but then, maybe that would be the solution I am looking for.  I found that when the product was new it did seem to lessen slightly the tendency of the ruler to slide across the fabric as you apply pressure and cut. However, it didn't seem to last very long. The more I used the rulers the more it appeared that the film had less and less of its nominal at best gripping power. I haven't taken the time to tear it off of all of my rulers--it isn't hurting anything where it is, even if it isn't greatly helping. But as edges start to curl up I peel it off and I have about half of my rulers with it and half without. I admit that as I work with them I have a hard time telling which have it and  which don't.  If anyone has a recommendation about something that has really worked for them I would be interested. My complaint about the little rubber feet is the fact that the ruler doesn't sit flat on the fabric and the fabric can shift a little as you cut--especially at the edges or folds. The sandpaper dots grabbed the fabric too well at times, making repositioning of the rulers difficult, and they are not transparent, so wherever you apply them they obscure the lines on the rulers. This is especially bothersome on the smallest rulers. I had hoped this product would solve my problem, but I will keep looking.	-1
I was hoping for a solution to slippery cutting rulers. This did not do the trick.	-1
Not sure it works well but it seems OK for now.  CON:  it comes in a roll so you have to fight the rolled sheet -- flat is better but then you get the 36" so a roll makes sense.	-1
Not worth the $.  Does not adhere well, nor make it grip much better.	-1
I struggled with this for a year before I gave up.  I have a ruler rack, resulting in constant battle of trying to get ruler in rack with film scrunching up, just didn't work.  I really didn't see a lot of difference with regards to stopping or reducing slippage when cutting fabric, especially on the long and large rulers.  I have RA and cutting and "firmly" pressing down on ruler was frustrating.  So I switched to little silicone dots! They work!  I've removed all the film from all my grids and the dots don't hamper rack storage!	-1
not a good product, took mine off the rulers two days after using the rulers.	-1
not a good product	-1
Waste of money!  Wish I had read reviews before I bought 2 rolls.  Does not change the way the ruler slides on fabric at all.	-1
I've tried this on 2 different cutting mats, didn't work.	-1
This is a wast of money. I end up using 2 rubber bands. The ones that are flat and that works much better and are cheaper than this useless plastic. You are better off buying a bag of long rubber bands and place them on the ruler. Do this first and if you don't like it, then spend the money but I don't think this is worthy, in my humble opinion.	-1
Unless I did something wrong, this does not stick the way I thought it would.	-1
I was disappointed in the performance of this product. Following the instructions carefully, I applied it to 2 of my quilting rulers. I'll concede that slippage on fabric decreased but not very much. It certainly wasn't worth the price.	-1
I was expecting, as it said.. to have some grip to the plastic to hold the template from moving when on the fabric while I am rotary cutting it..... but..it does nothing to keep the template from moving when on the fabric. Template slides like it did without it. I am not happy with this product..it doesn't do what it says. Now, it does keep the templates from sliding around when they are stacked together...template to template. That is a tad of help since when I use several size templates, and they are sliding all over..this product makes them kind of stick together so they don't get pushed around and have to hunt for them. But it is advertised to hold the template to the fabric..and it doesn't	-1
http://www.amazon.com/Safety-Walk-Shower-Tread-1-Inch-180-Inch/dp/B000KKRJAY/ref=cm_cd_ql_qh_dp_t  I cut this in thin strips and put on my rulers along each edge and across the diagonal. There is no way this slips. it is adhesive too so cannot lose its cling like this stuff. It is clear and grips like crazy with little pressure	-1
I am new at rotary cutting so decided to buy this product to help me do a better job of cutting for my second quilt. I didn't notice any change - still slippery - moved while cutting. I am aware that as a new quilter I probably need more practice rotary cutting.	-1
Wasted money on this one. I put it on and the ruler slides the same with as without it. It might be better on top of the ruler so I can write on it to mark my measurement in order to verify I am always cutting at the correct measurement.	-1
I'd return it but not even worth the trouble,  I put it in my donation box. When applied to my OMNIGRID ruler, it slid right across the fabric, no gripping at all.  Stick with the sandpaper dots - they are the best ever.  They are cheap and last a long time.	-1
This product works if you are cutting on a fabric with no seams and everything is laying flat.  It does not hold if you are laying ruler over the top of a seam.  It wobbles and moves.  My Omnigrip rulers hold same without this product.	-1
I thought I would give this a try, but I can't say the slipping quit, plus at moments it would come off the back side. I have noticed on some fabric the slippage is not as bad, but I use cotton a lot and it just didn't work.	-1
I didn't find this worked well at all.  Don't waste your money here.  Rulers did not hold place any better with this on it at all.	-1
This is not quite what I thought it would be. The sand comes off. It's not see through so it obscures my cutting ruler measurements. It's small so it's not big of a deal.	-1
I definitely would not waste my time and money buying this variety of needle threaders.  I have used these and they do work great, but they are SO easy to lose and bend.  For just a few dollars more you can get a very sturdy Clover needle threader that works like a champ every time and includes a thread cutter!  Here is a great overview and tutorial on how the Clover needle threader works.	-1
Bought thinking I could use them to thread a regular sewing machine needle but it would not pull through.  They have a no return policy!   ...so put them away as maybe they might work with a larger needle eye.	-1
Not for serger machines.  To thick.	-1
Followed all the directions to a T and didn't work for me. I'm an avid sewer but I'm by no means a seamstress. However no matter what I tried, it didn't work. I was pretty bummed that it barely stuck long enough to sew a hem.	-1
I'm sorry for a bad review. But this needle threader is thick. Probably can be use for big needle head. If you plan to use for embroidery needle. Then it doesn't work.	-1
Very flimsy, two in package already broken when received.	-1
This punch is garbage. Seriously. This is my second try, too. (There wasn't a return policy? But Amazon sent me another.)  First, the punch is hard to press. For being a good brand in scissors, I thought Fiskars would offer a sharp punch. Wrong. Not only is it hard to punch, but there seems to be a burr or two on the edge, leaving the paper with rough edgesnot a clean cut.  The worst is probably that after about 20 punches, it stopped opening altogether. It kept sticking, but so much so that I had to pry it with two hands to get it to open up.	-1
Doesn't have a metal tip. Just leather.	-1
Terrible, will not stay on my fingers, keep coming off and too small.	-1
Completely ineffective. It barely sticks at all. I ended up having to safety pin my son's dress pants to hold them up because no matter how long I ironed this crap just peeled off. Useless.	-1
It is unusable for my purpose. the hole punch may be 1/4 inch, but it is a 1/4 inch on the long side. the short side is maybe a 1/8 of inch. that wouldn't be bad except it only punches vertical holes. I had intended to use it to punch holes for custom inserts for my wire bound planner but it is completely useless for that purpose because only a string could go thru it. I would return it but it's not worth it.	-1
Not at all what I expected. Sent it back	-1
This was useless.  I followed the instructions precisely and it did not thoroughly bond the material together.  I tried again and again.  I hate sewing. I gave up and got out the needle and thread.  My sister, a sewer, quilter, etc., has indicated that this product was useless in her experience as well, and that there are good products out there.  I will keep searching.	-1
broke in less than 2 mos.	-1
This is my second time purchasing this item and for whatever reason they just don't hold up.  The punch dulls very quickly and the mechanics give out.	-1
sticks when you punch cardstock	-1
I couldn't get this product to work as described. I would have been better off taking out a needle and some thread and sewing the garment myself. Not a fan.	-1
Disappointed.  It cannot punch through light cardstock at all.  Even after I punched through a sheet of aluminum foil a dozen times, it punched through looseleaf paper raggedly, roughly, unreliably.  I had trouble pulling the puncher out of the looseleaf paper after making a hole!  Messy holes.  I expected better from a Fiskars product because they have such a long and stolid reputation for their cutting tools.  I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone.  It came early and packaged well, but it's dinky and unweildy. Try another brand, I guess.  That's what I'll do.	-1
I didn't even want to give this product one full star.  Would not punch a whole through any type of paper that I tried.  Was really hoping this would work on a wedding project I'm doing for my centerpieces.  Since others stated it worked on ID badges, I thought for sure it would go through 2 pieces of photo paper, NOPE!  Won't even punch a whole through normal paper.  Would love to send back, however; had already thrown away the packaging that it arrived in because I didn't start my project for a few weeks after they arrived.  Very disappointed that I wasted the money.	-1
Thought I'd give Krylon another shot. Not impressed. The paint easily scraped off metal with a fingernail while handling so where's the primer at?  Had to redo an entire project and also had bubbling in spots I tried to recover. As a cheap paint for wood it's fine I guess, I prefer Rustoleum, coverage seems smoother. I'll buy a straight primer paint next time as a prep. Don't buy into the primer duo nonsense.	-1
Did not spray.	-1
This Baby Pink yarn is terrible! As I have been using it there are thin strands that are barely held together. There are strands that are totally frayed and I had to improvise as I was crocheting! Very disappointed. I have other skeins in many colors and not one of them is like the that.	-1
I gave a 1Star bc the striped pattern that was created was nice. With that said this yarn split while crocheting making it horrible to work with.  I also saw  this identical name brand and colors in a fav store for half the price.  Not buying this yarn again	-1
The eye of the needle is too small for embroidery floss.. You may be able to get 2 strands in it, but forget about 3 strands, which is what i use..Way too expensive for needles that can't be used for their purpose.. I've tried using a threader, but it just pulls apart trying to get through the eye... I have now purchased 4 styles of the John James needles and none of them seem worth the extra money...	-1
OK. I'm totally pissed with Krylon. This is my third attempt at painting an antique metal too box with their incompetently formulated paint. I've used Krylon on many projects over the years, very familiar with their paints - at least up to now. I had put down a couple coats of paint as describe on their instructions. The next day I wet sanded the coat to get out some minor imperfections. and let it dry thoroughly. As soon as I re-sprayed what was to be the final finish coat - several places fried and bubbled up. Temps are 70-80 degrees in the shade. The first time I thought it might be the base paint. So, I switched to a primer that I had used before with Krylon with success and bought another new can of Krylon in case there was a batch problem. Same thing happened again. Each time this crap has to be stripped, re-sanded and re-primed. I think what is happens is that the Krylon paint I'm using never really cures. When a second application is made the next day the solvents in the paints penetrate the uncured first coat, expand and loosens the initial coat - frying it. This does not happen with a competently formulated paint that cures/drys properly.  I have had it now with Krylon forever - and will tell everyone I know about this totally unacceptable experience. I used to think Krylon was a great spray can paint. Now - I would give them a zero if it was an option. Totally pissed.	-1
These are not CREWEL needles! Nor does John James company say they are!!! John James established in 1804 does not miss-label their products!!! Crewel needles are used with wool. To be exact 1-2 ply wool not thread. The holes should be many numeric sizes larger with not so sharp a point to be considered a crewel needle due to the details of what crewel is and the wool one uses to do it. Embroidery thread is not crewel wool ply.  Buyers Beware!  I returned them to Amazon . . . Too bad Amazon had to waste their time and S/H costs to me and then the return since they were miss-represented by the title on the website.	-1
I tried everything, read all the instructions, this just does not bond strong enough to hold up the hem of my pants. It came loose after a few days. Can't see how it can survive any washings. Time to break out the sewing kit.	-1
Incredibly unimpressed with the quality of this hole punch. Admittedly, I was looking to punch holes in an Altoids mint tin, but these things didn't hold up at all. They deformed from hand strength alone. I'd return the item but it's nearly unrecognizable after I vented my frustration.	-1
It would probably be fine for one sheet of paper, but broke when we tried to punch a key card.  If all you want it for is paper it is probably ok	-1
COLOR IS TOO YELLOW.  DOES NOT MATCH COLOR OF LID.	-1
It is very fine. Not as described. It seems more like a thick string than yarn.	-1
did not work for me	-1
The hole this tool makes is not as large as I needed it to be (wide enough to clip a lanyard to), so I have to punch everything twice.	-1
Opened package to find yarn had been cut in several places	-1
This paint is super thin and needs too many coats.	-1
it did not cut like i thought it would, their was a review that said it cut through a thin tin container so i figured it could cut through three thickness's of material it doesn't now i still have to find something else	-1
This is beautiful yarn at a really horrible price.  For $7+ I thought I was getting three skeins and it even said that in the description (or so I thought).  Alas, no.  So the yarn is nice, the price is not.  Don't be fooled.	-1
I liked it at first, but the blade dulled very quickly	-1
The cost of this Zebra color is ridiculous.  REALLY......3 times the normal cost.  Just a ripoff.	-1
The yardage,is very deceiving. This is extremely expensive for the amount of yarn in the skein. I was expecting 364 yards many others who ordered it, but the actual skein is 236 yards. I will never order yarn from Amazon again.	-1
This yarn is probably fine for kids' craft projects and maybe some lessons in the most basic of knitting or crochet stitches, but it was a poor choice for crocheting a hat. It's not soft at all, and it's so very inelastic. Even having made my gauge swatch, I ended up with a hat that was too big simply because the ribbing didn't hug in like it was supposed to. It stayed stiff and extended. I made the exact same pattern with an alpaca yarn and it came out beautifully, but the hat from this yarn I'll chalk up to a learning experience.	-1
What's he point of having the option to select quantity, 3-pack.... Assuming I'm getting THREE of these?! It's a single pack, 1-pack.... Meaning, you receive ONE of these!	-1
The Spinrite Softee Baby is inconsistent between solid colors of the same brand.  In this color (Little Bo Peep) the beige and white matched with those solids but the pink is much much brighter than the pink of the same brand so I could not use it for my project.	-1
Not pleased I order three balls yarn for 15 I needed one more and had pay 8. Some bs	-1
I thought that this was the larger size skein because the description said ECONOMY but it turned out being the regular size skein (I didn't know the size by ounces at the time). Just so everyone will know... I would of never paid over $7.00 for what I could of got for $3.00 at Walmart. My bad!	-1
I have been stitching the Mariner's Light kit.  I do not like the fabric, floss or needle. The fabric is stiff, unpleasant to work with, the floss is nowhere near as nice as DMC, resists frogging, tangles even when I use Thread Heaven. The needle is flimsy and bends easily.  I do like the thread organizing system.  I do not think I will be purchasing any more Dimensions kits - too expensive for Chinese manufactured near-junk.	-1
I liked the product but have discoverd it was wsyyyyy overpriced!!!	-1
This yarn should not be called "glow" anything.  It is misleading.  I would not have purchased it had I known it does not glow.	-1
the pointy part broke after the second use.	-1
I bought this to spray in our driveway, with 6 coats you could still barely see it.	-1
This yarn was way to small for the money	-1
I ordered because it stated it was light grey. It's more silver and does not match a light grey I was already working with.	-1
It was terrible.  It consisted of very rough yarn that was not in one piece skeins - in three or four foot pieces periodically throughout.  Very disappointed.  Have used super saver for years and never bought such inferior yarn.  Will think twice before buying again.	-1
This yarn is horrible! Color is beautiful and the price is good but I found several small knots and it's extremely fuzzy! I have others by the same brand that are fine but this one is awful	-1
I have bought this yarn previously (Aran) and was satisfied.  I recently bought two skein and found them totally flawed.  Consistanly varied as to the width, the twist and one skein was knotted twice.  I will never again purchase Red Heart 4 ply again.  Where was the quality control? On to another brand.  Milli	-1
Very expensive small skein of yarn.	-1
Description said 364 yard., What I received is 235 yards this is not what I paid for	-1
It is not like the color pictured.  I was disappointed.  If you're not looking for a perfect color match it's okay.	-1
Way over priced for one small skein of yarn. I thought it was the jumbo with a charge of over 7 dollars a skein	-1
i was disappointed as both skeins of yarn had some yarn unraveled, and all knotted.	-1
stripes to far apart could not use it	-1
This paint sputters and drips when used, rather than applying a fine mist.  Shaking the can to mix, and turning nozzle a bit was no help. I  ended up buying a different paint at local paint store to use instead.	-1
Horrible yarn. Inconsistent from skein to skein; some will be relatively soft and okay to work with, and the next will be much thicker and rougher, which will cause gauge to be inconsistent. The rougher texture will also be uncomfortable to work with. There is good reason this yarn is cheaper than others. Go for a better yarn and you will enjoy working your project much more, and the end result will be far superior.	-1
I ordered 10 skeins of this yarn and every skein has two to three places where they had tied it together.  I cannot use it for certain projects I wanted to because of that.	-1
Has some shimmer to it, but would definitely not call this metallic at all.	-1
BUYER BEWARE. Right in the middle of this skein was a knot with frayed ends. As in, they two two length of yarn and tied them together. So, halfway through a piece that was to be a gift, I have a knot.	-1
THIS PRODUCT IS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS I'VE EVER BOUGHT THRU AMAZON.  THE PAINT WAS VERY THIN, RUNNY, AD DID NOT COVER WELL.  ASIDE FROM THAT THE PAINT CAME OUT SPLOTCHY AND ENDED UP ALL OVER MY HANDS AND THE CAN.  THERE IS NOTHING, NOTHING- GOOD I COULD SAY ABUT THIS PRODUCT.  READ MY REVIEW ON RUST-OLEUM FOR A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS JUNK!	-1
Only used it one time and did not like the results. Will try it on another object	-1
So bad I returned it. It was like clear paint with some pigment mixed in. (Yes, I shook it for 2 minutes before using). Would have taken 3 or 4 coats to do what Rustoleum spray paint does in 1 or 2 coats. Horrible.  Maybe I just got a bad can. In that case, 1-star for feeble quality control. A paint company should know better.	-1
The bottle leaked--all over	-1
Not as soft as others I've bought in the past.	-1
Over priced for product	-1
Overpriced for the size, this product can be found at Wal-Mart for half the price, when I read economy size for 8 bucks would have been a good price if it was in fact economy size which it is not	-1
Way too expensive. When I saw supersaver I thought it would be a larger skein. Can buy that in the stores here for half the price.	-1
I called red heart and complained about the inferior quality of this yarn.  Red heart apologized and I am waiting for a new supply of it to come to market	-1
I'm not a fan of this brand of yarn, I won't buy it again, but that is just my personal preference. It snags and unravels a lot more that the yarn I am used to.	-1
Not as advertised. Listed at $.37 recorded on my amazon charge over $7.	-1
First of all, this item arrived broken and pretty much unusable --- the shipping packaging was non-existent. That being said, I realized that I want and need to make my own compartments, size-wise and buying a container with permanent compartments is not for me.	-1
bien	-1
You still need to cut your fabric to the right size. So what's the advantage? the folding. glue in your garment.. Seriously?	-1
I like it.	-1
This particular skein of yarn was SO thin compared to others of the same exact brand.	-1
I picked this color due to description "Measures 364-yards length" yet only 236. I cannot do the project I needed it for with this yardage.	-1
I bought this bias maker by mistake; thought it would fit my Simplcity bias maker. That should be made clear to shoppers.	-1
This thread tangled around the base of the tread holder in my machine both in the upright and horizontal position.  The thread would then lock up.  I got so frustrated with it I through it out and bought another brand.  Would definitely not recommend.	-1
I can't believe I just paid $6 for one skein of floss. It's really laughable I thought I was getting a pack of 12. So, now I'm out the money and I still have to go to the store to buy for floss. ridiculous.	-1
Is this price correct...one skein of this floss is $6.33?  Or is there more in this order?  This has to be a mistake. Right?	-1
Was very unhappy with the amount of thread the price was very high and the description was miss leading. you will receive 1 DMC - Six Strand Embroidery Cotton 8.7 Yards . The description and price lead me to think it was a box of 12 of DMC - Six Strand Embroidery Cotton 8.7 Yards . Amazon was very helpful on the return of this item.	-1
The color is NOT shocking pink - it's more of a boring mauvey-rose pink.  If I had known the true color I wouldn't have ordered this yarn :(	-1
This is usely a good yarn for price. I pitched 3. The first one was really nice when I started on my blanket. Half way through it was not twisted as well as at the beginning but still it was fine. The other two was separating and catching on the crochet hook. I was making a baby blanket but because of the separating of the yarn I decided to make it a smaller blanket for my grandaughters dolls. I would not buy this again because of the time you lose when it splits on the hook and the stitches are not always smooth.	-1
I have made a lot of afghans in my many  years of crocheting but always used Red Heart wool and I thought I was getting wool this time. The  texture of this yarn was very loose stitches and split a lot.. I need to make another one after this and hope I can go back to wool.	-1
Only 364 yds, for the price($7 +} I was expecting the 744 yd skein. I don't know if this is an error or not.	-1
This comes up when searching for glow in the dark but doesn't glow at all	-1
The yarn came without any protection.  It has several dirty spots on the yarn.  Very disappointed!	-1
Terrible quality thread. It got caught every time I tried to use it in my machine. Very frustrating.	-1
This shade was a completely different size yarn than the other red heart super saver colors I bought. Much thicker and coarser. Ruined my project.	-1
If you are looking for a cheap seam ripper, this is it. The blade is bulky. It works, but it is not my first choice when I want to remove stitches. It's probably best for a beginner or student who is not sure if he/she wants to really get into sewing. For serious quilters/sewers, it is just a backup.	-1
This thread isn't very strong.  It  might be good for basting or gathering, but I was disappointed in it for general sewing.  It frays easily and broke quickly under tension.  I thought it would be a good buy at the price, but it's not.  If you do a lot of basting gathering - go for it.  Otherwise don't bother.	-1
I will never buy this again. It continually unraveled and falls apart. You get what you pay for.	-1
Over priced	-1
THIS IS NOT SUPER SAVER ECONOMY YARN LIKE IT SAYS!!! It is the smaller size! Now I have to order the same amt to have enough!	-1
This is the worst yarn I have ever used.  I have used many different colors of red heart yarn, they make great hats, slippers etc.  however this color was so stiff.  The hand warmers I made are rough, going to try washing and drying with a softener to see if they can be used.  I have no idea why this one color or dye lot is so bad.  I can't say don't buy this brand as I use a lot of it every year, just wish there was a way to return it to red heart or at least an explanation.	-1
This yarn is SUPER scratchy & likes to unravel itself when trying to crochet it.	-1
A ripper iso  a ripper until someone thinks they have a better idea... this ripper is difficult to hold due to 'new shape', you cannot put the lid on the tail which leaves the lid subject to getting lost...	-1
I paid $9+ for 364 yards of yarn!!!  TOTAL RIPOFF!!  These were supposed to be DOUBLE SIZED skeins!!!  I pay $2.50 for 364 yards at local stores!!!  I want a return label unless I get 2 more skeins, one of each color!!!	-1
Joivut	-1
This yarn is pieced together. When you try to ball it it unravels, knots and the color is inconsistent. Especially the orange colored ones. Red dye is dropped throughout. It actually looks like someone bled on it. Comparing it to other yarns it isn't soft either. I prefer Vannas choice or Bernat. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit more on quality.	-1
They broke within a couple months. Waste of money. Would have bought metal ones from the start.	-1
The seam ripper itself is okay and works, but the protective lid will absolutely not stay on.  The small clear plastic cap is too large and just slides off the top.	-1
Very unhappy with this yarn.  Very scratchy and a lot of knots.	-1
My mistake, when I saw glow, I thought it was glow in the dark yarn	-1
Just received the package. I thought the yarn should be new, with the paper band on. And I ordered 2 items.	-1
I'm an expErienced knitter and I'm used to a certain quality.  This has to be counterfeit or not first cut quality.  This had tons of knots.  I  a64 yard ball I foun this came out to be 5 balls.  Lots of short cut pieces and poorly spliced together.  Huge tangled mess! I'd want a refund if it wasn't such a hassle to return it.  Never Again	-1
The product appeared to have been used.  The Red Heart label was completely torn from the yarn.  The yarn appeared to have been unwrapped from the center (not the pull out end) and to have been cut -- as the end of the yarn was frayed.	-1
Very small skeins, smaller than I expected  for the price but this was the only place I could find some more of the color I needed so I kept them. Wished the description had listed ounces since that's what I am used to working with.	-1
Cheap and ugly, but I should have known that when I bought it.	-1
Got half way through my crochet project when I encountered the Gordian Knot lurking within the center of the skein.  This yarn was so knotted and tangled, I couldn't get the center portion of the skein to come out of either end, so now I'm stuck winding roughly 850 yards of yarn into balls from the outside end of the yarn instead of working on my project.  Other than that, the yarn is fairly soft, easy to work with, a pretty shade of gray and inexpensive.  Worth it, if you don't mind spending HOURS winding hundreds of yards of yarn balls and untangling knots instead of working on your project.  I mind greatly.	-1
Love Pound of Love yarn. Plenty of it and it knits up well .. I have made toys ,blankets .,sweaters, caps and gloves etc. Always pleased with the results.	-1
This yarn was the worst yarn I ever bought! It  kept separating and also cost twice as much at amazon then it does in a store. I ordered it because the store was out of it and I had a project I was working on. I thought for the price it was a bigger ball of yarn. [O	-1
Over priced!	-1
I usually very happy to buy my yarn here but this specific item came to me yesterday and the colors were faded and off...	-1
Very poor quality, the inner yarn is full of knots and the yarn has areas where there are thicker areas like fur balls.  I had to cut the yarn four times with one skein at a loss of about 1/4 of the skein. The second was worst I was so frustrated that I refused to go through the time consuming process of trying to salvage the skein and threw it away!  Would not recommend this yarn.  I have used other Lion yarns and have been satisfied but this particular product is inferior!	-1
The color is the shade of teal I needed, but it is not wool, but acrylic. My project is felted and acrylic will not work.  There was no receipt in the package for me to return it.  I continue to save it in the wrapper if I do receive a recept.	-1
Don't love it, it's very soft but splits and looks frizzy	-1
Love the way colors work, but yarn keeps separting. Am used to a much better product from Red Heart. Never had an issue before.	-1
i should have read the pound thought i was getting little balls but instead i got three bulks of this color, wish the picture of the description would have said that before i ordered it	-1
This yarn has an irritating number of breaks and ties in it, and I won't be buying this any more unless this purchase is made right with me. I would call it outlet quality and is not at all what I expect of Lion Brand. My Pound of Love was a peck of trouble. I do love the mint green color. I'm knitting a prayer shawl for my church to give, and I take pains with these.	-1
Fabric.com sent this in a box that was too small for the ruler. This means I have a ruler that is bent and shaped like a boat. For now only 2 Stars I might increase it if I can get the ruler to lie flat.	-1
It is soft, but it loses fibers all over the place. It is a lot like a shedding long hair cat.	-1
Lots of thin spots, frays easily.  Not the quality I expect from Red Heart.	-1
I bought this in two colors.  The turquoises is fine but the bubble gum pink is defective. The strands unravel and it changes thickness throughout the project.  I Am very disappointed in the pink and am thinking of contacting the manufacturer of the defect.	-1
Definitely "economy" yarn!  Very rough and scratchy to touch. Great if you are crocheting patterns like baskets where you need the extra stiffness to hold a shape. Terrible for items you would wear.	-1
This yarn is a great color, but the quality isn't great. It's a little thick and course which makes it hard to work with. I didn't expect much better for the price.	-1
It was not quite what I was looking for	-1
Ok	-1
As you can see the color I ordered was a light pink but when it was delivered it was the color of a creamsicle and I hate that color so I am returning it.  Be careful with pics and colors.  Not always a close match.	-1
Yarn is good quality, but from the photo I thought the platoon is white, grey, and black. Instead the coloring was in the beige and brown family.	-1
Yarn	-1
Bought this to decorate for my sons street art dance hoping for more glow. However there was not a lot of  glowing coming off this yarn. Did look neat latticed across the ceiling but white would have done the job just as well. Two stars for being a great product, strong, well packaged just not much 'glow'.	-1
I cannot use this yarn. It started to shred as soon as I tried to cast off.	-1
Has a terrible feel	-1
Perfect for keeping my rulers organized.  I have one on the wall but I have too many different rulers and this on fits on my cutting table perfectly. Love it	-1
This yarn is really economic and big but this yarn isn't soft it is really hard.	-1
wrong color	-1
Not glow in the dark	-1
This yarn was crap. Frays super easy. I let my daughter use it for practicing her stitches as it was useless to me.	-1
Color too bright. Much brighter than advertised. Makes a good companion to to the advertised pumpkin color yarn. That is if you like screaming colors.	-1
The sellers price is nearly double the suggested retail price. I believed this was a Super Size skein but it was only a regular 7 oz skein. I wouldn't pay this price again for cheap acrylic yarn.	-1
Spring green : warning...the actual colour is a lot duller than it looks on the screen	-1
The picture (or the product I received) is off.  What I received was simply an off white string/yarn - no color variation at all (unlike the picture).  Had I known that this is what I would get I would have ordered something else.	-1
Not much yarn with this product !!  Used to be you got so much for a couple dollars...........I would need 25 or more of these for just one blanket !	-1
I am just learning to crochet and selected this yarn because it had great reviews, the skein was large and the price was low. The color is as vibrant and wonderful as the picture would lead you to believe, and the skein really is huge given the low price. I figured this would be a great yarn to learn and practice on. However, I think this product is for those who have a lot more experience working with yarn than I do. The yarn kept splitting apart. Very often my hook would go through the yarn itself, instead of through the stitch, causing catches and knots in my work. I found this very frustrating and it slowed me down a lot. Finally I gave up and passed this yarn on to a friend who is a lot more experienced than I am. The yarn is beautiful, but a nightmare for beginners like me. (Plus, it's on the scratchy side; it squeaked pretty loudly against the needles.) I recommend Lion's Brand yarns instead. They are somewhat pricier (and the skeins are usually much smaller), but I found that yarn to be much easier to work with.  P.s. - If you go to a specialty site dedicated to yarn crafts, like Love Knitting, Red Heart is pretty low down on the list of "most loved" worsted weight yarns. Not a good sign.	-1
This yarn was beautiful in color but the quality was horrible....so bad I'm thinking of writing to red heart.  It separated into separate strands almost through the entire skein, and I used 9 skeins out of the 10 I bought.  I would not buy this again...which is too bad because the color was really pretty!	-1
Color is far more pink than this photo shows. Returned and the search continues for the right color	-1
it had black ashes on my white yarn no  one wants dirty yarn	-1
This wool might work well for crochet but for knitting the wool comes off as threads.	-1
This is more like a heavy string than yarn.	-1
Colors are great. The big problem is the marrakesh color is advertised at 364 yards but is actually 236 yards according to the skein sleeve. False advertising? I do know that  no 2 skeins of red heart are the same length no matter how they are marked. But 128 yards falsely advertised is ridiculous. I bought 4 skeins so I got shorted 512 yards or about 2 1/2 skeins. Received 20 more skeins today, 4/20. All were advertised as 364 yards per skein but in actuality were 236 yards. In other words I was fraudulently shorted over 2500 yards more with this order. The total shortage for all ordets received so far is just over 3000 yards.	-1
yarn was a tangled mess, couldn't use it. I have worked with this before and not had a problem so I think it was just a bad skein.	-1
splits hard to use on my knitting loom	-1
iTS OK	-1
Too expensive.	-1
It did not meet my expectations.  I was expecting a light shade of coral.  It was nice and soft though.	-1
Not that great	-1
I honestly thought when you stated kit.  It would be a kit of items, that is the only reason 2 was purchased.	-1
It is very rough feeling yarn...too bulky.	-1
Bought the wolf design. The design is nice BUT it says this is on 18 count plastic canvas. Well it's not. It's on 18 count Aida cloth. I will prob send it back.	-1
Very thin.	-1
This is worst yarn I've ever bought. Instead of the strands being together it's like working with four separate thin strands. This happened with two different colors. I'll never buy this yarn from Amazon again!  I'd give it zero stars if i could!!	-1
I'm sure it does it's job great (threading yarn through needles) but I'm afraid to use it because it is so PAPER THIN that I bent mine just taking it out of the packaging. Please be careful taking yours out when you get it. I keep mine in the little box my Boye's split ring stitch markers came in since I have 2 of those and it was handy and the right size.... I would spend the extra money and get the sturdier kind. Just saying.	-1
I love Sugar'n Cream Yarn but save yourself some money, get it at WalMart for $1.77	-1
This was supposed to let us thread our chenille needles, but it doesn't work very well.  A thinner needle threader does a much better job.	-1
Waste of money. Did not thread my large eye needles.	-1
Very disappointed . Maybe good for knitters but I crochet and have no idea what and how to use this thread .  It is not yarn .	-1
its a pretty yarn but not what I ordered. I ordered purple tones and got the candy color.	-1
This yarn is advertised as having 364 yards per skein.  It only has 236 yards.  I can buy it cheaper at somewhere else.	-1
Too tough! Cannot wear on body, only for carpet.	-1
I would not use this for anything other than a rag, and I would not go to the trouble to knit a rag.	-1
Love the color, however, the yarn gets stringier as you use it until it is very hard to use due to extreme stinginess. The yarn threads do not hold together, after project is finished I will not purchase again. Very disappointed in Red Heart Quality. Have used Red Heart for decades, maybe I got a bad one????	-1
Yarn has a beautiful color and it is soft, however it is pretty thin, compared to other Red Heart yarns.  In some areas has some knots that needed to be cut out.	-1
This item was not what I expected. The cost was higher then if I bought it at was of Walmart. I was expecting maybe one of the larger balls of yarn at this price or at least 2 balls of yarn.	-1
From the picture, this looked much more of a finer yarn than it is. It turned out bulky and unuseable and was not soft at all. Disappointed.	-1
Beautiful colors but very thin. It's more like a size 2 baby yarn without the softness than a size 4 worsted weight. Also it cost too much. You can save almost $5 per skein by buying the same brand at Wal-Mart ($2.88 each).	-1
In the past, I've bought this yarn from Walmart and really liked it. However, it hasn't been available for a while, so I thought I'd just order it online. The packaging looks the same, but the quality of the yarn is not good. It's thinner than usual, and it's difficult to work with because it snags easily.	-1
It is just what it says ECONOMY yarn, cheap but poor quality in my opinion.	-1
I realize that ordering yarn online means there may be some color variation from what I see on the screen. I also realize a yarn called "pumpkin" should be on the orange side. This yarn appeared to have more of a yellow tint online and it is nothing short of neon orange! I ordered this along with another color that showed up as a very green color, nothing like what I expected, and now I have neon orange and green for a project I was really looking forward to...	-1
Does anyone know how many ounces is in this skein?  Pattern go by how many oz of yarn you need.  Is this a 5 oz skein or 7 oz skein?	-1
color is much lighter than it appears online and when order arrived the one skein was frayed and unusable	-1
I found out that this yarn is way over-priced when I finally took a trip into town (an hour away) and saw it for sale at Michaels for $3.19 instead of the $7.97 price this seller is asking. The yarn itself is dull and coarse and rough on the hands.  I decided not to use this yarn I was overcharged for and get better stuff at Hobby Lobby.	-1
The yarn seemed more of a vibrant color in the photo. But my main issue  with this yarn is that it was such a poor quality.  It was difficult holding the tension when I was crocheting because the yarn was so flimsy. I'm reteaching myself to crochet after having putting down my crochet needles over 10 years ago.  This yarn started to fray even before I had to pull it apart to redo a couple of rows. In my humble opinion this yarn was not worth the over six dollars I paid for it. I certainly would not use it to crochet gifts for family and friends.	-1
I ordered a few different yarns from red heart, since i loved using them before. Sadly this time when i used them, the package was stolen off my porch and they refused to give me a refund or to resend me the yarn I ordered. Very disappointing.	-1
I've been using Red Heart yarn for years and it's always been nice and soft and easy to work with.  However when I chose this variegated combination to use in my current project I noticed it's very scratchy and rough feeling and also hard to work with.  It doesn't slide off the crochet hook easily.  I love the colors they make in this combination yarn but there is something about the fabric content that makes it scratchy so I won't be using it again.  I compared the content to the plain colors and it's the same so they must be doing something in the color process that makes it rough.  Come on Red Heart I know you can do better, your yarn has always been so great to work with and such a bargain to buy.  Don't mess it up now!  I'll stick with the solids.	-1
This is not a super saver yarn. Super saver is a lot BIGGER size at the price I paid It should have been a pounder size. I'm going to return this order. It is way over priced.	-1
If this item had been available, it would have only been priced at $2.44 per skein. I needed the yarn to Complete a project that I was working on, or I wouldn't have ordered it at the price that it was sold. I checked stores In a 25 mile radius before I ordered online.	-1
This yarn is very coarse. It was not nice to work with. The colors are play, but I hated crocheting with this.	-1
Guess need to know the ounces on yard as I paid 7 for this and can get it at Walmart for 2.69 Not ever going to get yarn online again	-1
Working with this yarn on plastic canvas is not recommended as it broke apart to easily and shredded apart to easy	-1
Since when did Amazon become the yarn police? I was only allowed to buy four skeins when it says there are 19 available. Now as a long-term Prime member not only do I have to spend 25 $ , I am limited to how many I can buy. It's like saying you can only buy two cups of flour when you need four. While I am at it...Amazon use to always have the best prices but not anym ore. I doubt I will renew my Prime Membership	-1
I did not like this yarn.  It was a very scratchy yarn and the colors were much duller than the picture (think army green instead of grass/tree green).	-1
I was disappointed in my purchase.  The yarn was priced to imply that it was 14 oz skeins, but was really only 7 oz.  Also, the yarn has many knots in it, making it unusable at times.	-1
It really took a long time to get here. Found what we needed at a local store to complete the project.	-1
Wrong item description! It is stated that it is 364 yards and when received it the yarn is 244 yard. This is overpriced for the yardage. WalMart has 244 yards for $2.50	-1
This is another to good to believe. they give you  a great price on the product but pad the shipping cost pretty badly. and trying to get a proper refund is a laugh so buyers beware. I haven't been able to place a claim because the system is not working on this one.	-1
I triple checked the numbers before I ordered, and they didn't match what I had.  I made due, but was unhappy.	-1
The painted desert yarn  is very thin and texture is rough i have used red heart many years and haven't had this problem	-1
When I purchased these two skeins of yarn I was under the impression that the price stated was for the 14 oz size per skein not the 7 oz for the same price.  I was excited that there would be no fee for shipping and handling but upon receiving the product I was disappointed to get something that I could go to Wal-mart for a pay only $2.77/skein.	-1
I can't believe this is even made. It is the most unpleasant feeling yarn I've ever felt. A total waste.	-1
Too expensive for the little bottle.	-1
Did not etch the glass, just slightly clouded it.  Left it on, per instructions; tried it longer, still no major etching.	-1
If you want a soft green color do not buy this! This is a bright green color, not at all like the picture shows!	-1
The pumpkin color is more tangerine then what is shown in the preview.  Would be nice if they had a more true to color picture.	-1
The yarn itself is great, and exactly what I use (I use about 20 skeins of Mexicana a year for lanyards), but the description for what I bought said 364 yards. The skeins I got were only 244 yards. I went back and looked at the image after my order came in, and the picture does show 244 yards, but I trusted the description when I ordered. I didn't mind paying 7.87 for 2 of the 364 yard skeins, but that is pretty high for 2 of the 244 yard ones.	-1
I have used a LOT of RED HEART yarn over the years but never have I used anything this stiff and unyielding. I bought this because I thought it was pretty. I knew I wanted to use it, but wasn't quite sure what I wanted to make. I ended up using it to crochet 5 squares of a 25 square blanket. This was the most difficult yarn I've ever worked with. On the bright side, my blanket is beautiful...	-1
I have been knitting for a long time and have always liked Red Heart yarn. My favorite source for yarn went out of business and I was delighted to find Red Heart on Amazon. Thank you.	-1
Amazon claims this measures 364 yards in length. When I got the yarn it said right on the package 244 yards. If I didn't need the yarn to complete a project I would return it. It is completely overpriced for what you get.	-1
The price for this product was much more than I would have paid in the store, but I needed it and could not find in any stores.  The color was slightly different although they were both light gray.  I will definitely make sure that I have enough of the necessary color before I start another project.	-1
The picture is totaly differant than what I received, will have to use it due have project to complete now. Love Red Heart products but the picture does not correspond with the actual product.	-1
The final product was very scratchy.  The yarn had several tie-on knots.  Two of them were only a few yards apart.	-1
I purchased this on line because it advertised the skein was 364 yards of yarn, not 244 yards. Had I known it was only 244 yards I could have purchased this at my local yarn shop for $2.99 each. Instead I paid over $6.00 each. Falsely advertised the skein was bigger than it actually is.	-1
Color is a Bright Pumpkin Orange NOT golden yellow as shown. The color recieved is a nice orange for pumpkins and pumpkin hats so I did not return.	-1
I only rated this 2 stars for the price. I just bought the same yarn. Same weight and length at Walmart for 2.77. That's half of the price they have it on here.	-1
Right color but not good to use when making stocking caps as product does not give. It also takes quite a bit more as this yarn is very thin!!!!!	-1
I have done a number of Dimensions stamped needlepoint kits.  This one is by far the worst I have done.  The colors of the stamping are so close that even in direct sunlight I couldn't make out the color difference enough to do the stitching.  I ended up having to use the printed instructions like a counted cross stitch (with the help of the picture from the front of the package).  Additionally, the entire kit was cotton floss, unlike some of the other kits I have done, where nicer wool yarn was provided.  Finally, there was not enough of the background color to complete the piece.  I ended up having to use yarn from an earlier kit.  Not a good beginner kit.	-1
The Moon Dreamer kit was disappointing.  The stock photo is color enhanced, the finished piece looks duller in real life.  The threads are mostly yarns instead of embroidery floss.  Not to mention that the stamped canvas is difficult to interpret.  It would be nice if these also included a counted stitch diagram for those of us who like to be more precise.  I was going to stitch this for a gift, but in the end I threw it away because even I didn't like how it turned out.	-1
Dimensions Needlecrafts Needlepoin "Puppy Mischief" I have not previously reviewed this Dimensions product.  When I opened the kit the printed canvas was missing.  Unfortunately, I was working on another piece and did not open this kit within the return window. Obviously, without the printed canvas, the kit is useless.  Be warned!  Open all Dimensions kits immediately upon receiving.	-1
Do not like this stuff, it doesn't stick!, not for me anyway, a waste of money!	-1
I was looking forward to learning needle point, but ended up very disappointed in this kit!! The instructions are imposable to understand!	-1
There are two types of white (one should have been silver or something like).  Instead of being able to match canvas to thread, you must match canvas to key and key to thread.  Dark grey is used to indicate green for example, rather than using green to indicate green.  The light and medium greens, on the canvas, are one shade apart.  Not one of their better kits.	-1
not the product's fault for sure, bt it never came.  i found great success using a couple quilting rulers, a round rolling blade (as opposed to scissors), and a cutting mat.  kind of pleased this never came.	-1
Bought this to make a quilt with as I thought it be nice and warm but it is sooooo difficult to work with.  Very thick but way tooo stiff and heavy.  Very hard to bend and control while trying to quilt it.  Took ALL day to quilt a 4 x 5 quilt.  Even after washing its still quite stiff.  I bought 4 of the 1 yard pieces and Im going to return 2 of the ones that I won't be using for my next quilt	-1
The razor pin dosn't rotate easly!! Fit for very thin papers.. For Cardstock not that much!	-1
bad cuts.	-1
OMG!  If I had known then what I know now!  This machine is way too sensitive and spends most of its time beeping warning messages because it doesn't like the thread, fabric or whatever else you try to do.  I'm an accomplished sewer and I can tell you, this machine isn't worth the money to spend most of your time fighting with it.  I wish I had bought something else.  So disappointed with this machine.  If you want to sew your way and not have the machine try to tell you what you can or can't do, buy something else.	-1
There was a ding in the top.	-1
Complete rip-off! box is practically empty, six small balls of yarn, a plastic needle, a plastic crochet hook, two plastic needles. instructions written in four different languages, and no instructions' on a project to make So, save your money, buy some yarn and real needles, and look for a video on you-tube. There is one connected with this set that shows you how to knit.	-1
I bought this for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas based on the reviews it has already received.  She has been asking me to teach her how to knit and I thought something like this under the tree would really surprise her.  It did.  It looks very attractive from the outside but it's what's on the insides that I'm disappointed with.  The wooden knitting needles were very rough and snagged the yarn when attempting to use them.  I had to take sandpaper and sand them relatively smooth.  The points at first are pencil-point sharp so I had to sand them down a bit too.  Just 8 tiny skeins of yarn, a cheap plastic sewing needle, 1 pair of very course wooden knitting needles, and a crochet hook are all you get, including some hard to follow directions.  I ended up using other knitting directions instead that were much clearer and easier to understand.  Tomorrow I'm going out and getting her a real pair of short, fat knitting needles and some more yarn.  The cardboard box is o.k. to use to carry around the small skeins and small wooden needles, but it won't hold any knitting project bigger than a child's knitted scarf.  I'd really rather have my money back to use to buy her real knitting needles and yarn.  UPDATE 1.17.12 I went to a Arts and Crafts store and bought her 2 pairs of fat knitting needles (aluminum), tons of wool yarn and some scissors for 26 dollars.  I wish I hadn't bought the Alex Yarn Craft Kit.  It could have at least included a pair of scissors to cut the yarn with.	-1
I received this item and it had been used Disappointed. Several yards cut off jagged by someone	-1
This stabilizer is very thin and can tear during the embroidery process, which can ruin a project. It doesn't have the stability in the hoop either, if it doesn't tear, it shifts and can get lettering off. I would not recommend this. I waited for a sale at my local craft store and bought a different brand. I like Sulky's other stabilizers, but not this one. When it says, "Tear Easy," take that literally, it tears too easy.	-1
I could not get the buttons that popped off the garment to go back on with this thing. I had one of the older kind and it was perfect but this one has a different type of plastic insert and it is very short so it will not fit any button I have. I can't get it to work for anything else wither so it is wasted money setting in my sewing box. I am still searching for the other t style plastic inserts for the other machine.	-1
I love Lion Brand yarn. However, this yarn tended to be a little too fuzzy.	-1
I bought this to make a hat, not realizing how stiff and non-pliable this would be. The resulting hat was stiff and the colors worked out like a clown hat; I had to knit a replacement hat out of other, softer yarn for the recipient, because it was embarrassingly ugly. Not nice yarn at all.	-1
I did not like this yarn, found it tough and hard to work with. Will not buy again. I use other lion brand and love it. Just did not care for this style.	-1
LEAD, NICKEL and COBALT! I would not put this on my child's face. http://achildgrows.com/blog/2012/10/is-face-painting-dangerous-2/	-1
I've been using these for years. These packs are  fun and convenient as anything. BUT they get super messy quick, run out quick, and tend to be blurry for line work.  NOT worth the money if you intend on face painting for any length of time. I recommend the 18ml snazaroo pots of basic colors for your bases. Brands like Mehron or Tag for anything else. Snazaroo is good for cheap base paints [sponging], terrible for any sharp-looking line work [lining/drawing designs].	-1
CRAP MADE MY KIDS FACE HAVE AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO THE PINK COLOR : (	-1
Uggh do not waste your time with this face paint there are so many others that are better.... Wolfe, paradise, mehron, DFX, TAG all have better coverage do not get gloppy on your after you ad water... not to mention the colors are muted and not very vivid and the case is cheap plastic and not sturdy at all. If you are doing a church or b-day gig with non professional face painters this is probably okay for a first endeavor into this field. If you are at all serious about face painting or learning stop do not purchase.... do some more research. Good Face paint is not cheap and its an investment. There are some professionals that love snazaroo but you will find a majority hate it for the reasons I stated above.	-1
It's really unfortunate that when I bought this, three color pods were missing from it. If I want to send it back, I need to pay back shipping, and really, what's the point of throwing more money at the issue?!	-1
If you want a PLAIN NOTHING box then this is it. If you want a pretty box like shown then you won't get it - I got a plain nothing box. Just a square box with a little latch to keep it closed. No handle, no string/rope or whatever is shown. I still have to keep it because it is a rushed present and the person I got it for lives 3 hours away and I had to give it to her plain and ugly. Also the BARCODE WAS STUCK ON THE FRONT of the BOX right in the middle!! which was horrible trying to get it off there. It took a long time and it took off the "laquered" coating no matter how careful we were in getting it off! Really weird.	-1
I ordered one before I ordered more for several dozen for gifts. The tops were flimsy and cracking and would not hold up under pressure of paint or any sort of fixture added. There were several deep cracks that I thought I could ix with gesso but thought it wouldn't fix it.	-1
As mentioned by others, the box is unlined. top of box is so thin I was afraid to chip carve on it, also lid turned yellow when trying to apply a pattern using a transfer tool using heat. Also lid stained unevenly even after using a sanding sealer. This is the first time my son asked me to carve him anything so this is really a dissapointment.	-1
I received this ruler and very unhappy because of the scratched on some corners... :(	-1
The tools and blades are great BUT the hinge on the case was broken still np ...BUT the case was covered in blue powder which proceeded to cover anything I touched including my face and clothing. I know I should have read the reviews but still what a mess no 5 stars for this product. Scary enough then read the warning for Californians on the package warning that it may contain substances that can cause cancer or birth defects.  Amazon you need to dump this seller just for the annoyance of scrubbing everything with bleach.  Won't bother with returning it will just go buy one in person.	-1
I bought this about a year ago. I hate it. The blades are hard to change because the opening won't let you slip the blade in even when it is wide open. Very dangerous. The blades slip even when they are tightened as far as you can go. I'm buying a whole new set because I just can't stand working with this anymore.	-1
Cheap.	-1
Not good at all.	-1
I expected some issues with a cheap kit but needed blades in my budget to experiment with. Upon removal from the plastic the blades fell OUT of the box into my lap, and I was cut because they were NOT secured. Additionally the red handle doesn't fit inside the case, which is strange. The blades are flimsy. The built in chucks feel unstable.  Do expect cheapness, you get what you pay for and if you are skilled you can compensate for these blades but higher quality is safer.	-1
I should have just went to michaels	-1
You get what you pay for. If you are a Serious Modeler these knives simply will never do. The case is sad. It will never latch and flexes easily. The few blades that come with are very flimsy and dull fast. The blades are stuck to a lame-ass magnetic strip. A pure waste, unless you are 8 years old and on a budget. Otherwise, X-Acto is the only way to go... including blades.	-1
I'm disappointed because the blue case arrived broken in half, making it extremely difficult to open and close the case. I have yet to actually use the knives, but for the variety and price, it's hard to beat. I'll just deal with the case - no big deal, just disappointing.	-1
Crap.  Don't waste your time.  Spend the extra money for X-acto brand.  I couldn't even use these with X-acto brand blades.	-1
Set does not cut very well - and each blade was pretty useless after about 2 passes.	-1
Junky. Blades start a bit sharp and dull almost immediately.	-1
I really wouldn't recommend this to a person serious about carving and this is coming from an am-mature. The blades don't fit into the knives properly when switched and now that I think of it, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Unless you are seriously desperate.	-1
I BOUGHT THE SAME ONE AT A DOLLAR STORE FOR $1.00. THE CASE IS CHEAP MADE, IT WONT CLOSE RIGHT AND EASY BREAK THE BLADE SOME HAD RUST BUT IM HAPPY I PAY 1.00, I ALSO GOT A SINGLE HUBBY KNIFE FROM HOMEDEPOT THAT IS BTHE STORE U CAN GET 6 GOOD BRUSH WOOD NOT THAT CHEAP PLASTIC FOR 1.00 ALL DIFFERENT SIZE IN THE SAME BAG AND STORE..	-1
Warped the paper. I had to throw my project away after spending a long time on it.	-1
Very unbalanced. Falls over for anything. Bought it for an expo I was attending to showcase a lithograph (attached to foamcore) and it fell over. Tried a small book to see if my drawing may need weight to keep it up while on display...fell over. Had to rig it with tape and cardboard at the bottom just to get it to stay open. Don't waste your money.	-1
They are too light weight and cheaply made, would not cut the edges on heavy photo paper which is what I purchased them to do!	-1
There were kinda expensive. I was expecting a great deal better. They all look just about alike. Really no better than the pair I bought for one dollar.	-1
These scissors barely cut. If you're using delicate paper or crepe paper, forget it. The blades will only chew paper that's not crisp.  As if that weren't bad enough, these scissors actually jam themselves. You have to be very careful how widely you open them, because they won't close if you open them too wide. The blades will interlock and jam. You can pry them apart, but it happens over and over if you try to use anything like the whole blade.	-1
I actually bought these to use with my foam sheets. But it doesn't work. However, they work fine on regular paper.	-1
Pretty flimsy, & not very sharp. Thought they might work on tissue paper - not a chance !!!	-1
Does not leave crisp cut edges particularly closer in the cut. Pain in the neck to always have to trim tiny paper fibers. Would not recommend at all, especially for the price. Very disappointed.	-1
Retracted stars. After some use, I find the pinking cutting blades do not leave crisp cut edges particularly closer into the cut. Pain in the neck to always have to trim tiny paper fibers. Would not recommend at all, especially for the price. Very disappointed.	-1
As another reviewer wrote in their review of the Chestnut Tweed color, the Moss Heather product is not as pictured. The reviewer said he ordered Moss Heather but got (what he or she would have named) Olive Drab. That is so true! Beware of this color and only order if you want a dull, flat olive color.	-1
Not good for felting - returned.	-1
This is not Merino wool, it is wool tho. I buy Lion's Brand fisherman's wool same price double the yardage. It doesnt even say it's Merino on the label. I hate when they stretch the truth so they can get more $$. I wish I could send one back I'm sure there's a restocking fee involved.  I had to buy 2 of these to make up the yardage on just one skein of lion brand and payed double, couldn't find solid black in fisherman's . Lesson learned never again...	-1
I was hoping it was just a bad picture and that the yarn would be "yellow". It's not...it's kinda 70's harvest gold bordering on orange. It worked fine since I was just making dryer balls, but I wouldn't buy it again in this color.	-1
the Pad is kind of dry im going to have to buy a refill and i haven't really used it...not impressed, not my first ink either i always store my ink pads upside down too keeps the ink on the pad surface.	-1
Ok	-1
I bought two of these distress inks, this one and another in Tea Dye. Tea Dye is wonderful, but this one came pretty much completely dried out. After doing the edges of a mere 15 or so pages, the ink pad is no longer putting out much, if any, color. If I need to buy a new package for every 15 pages (just the edges, mind you!) this project is going to cost me a fortune, as I'm trying to distress a 600 page book!!  I'd return it or demand a replacement, but it's just too much hassle to ship this little piece of garbage all the way back and wait for another. I'll just have to do the distressing with Tea Dye alone, not that one and this in combination. Really disappointed.	-1
I recieved some of these Distress ink pads as a gift...I had been talking about them an a friend got me some...Now i'm fairly new to this whole scrapbooking , stamping thing so I didn't know that these inks are not made for stamping ! I had no idea they were used in another manner..I recieved alot of the differant colors, lovely but i have no clue how these are to be used..An frankly I think that even though all the packs are sealed the one i opened an try'd to use seemed very dry..Even when i rubbed on paper after i figured out they were not suitable for stamping..The simple fact that is no indication on the actual package that these are not for stamping is very misleading to me...I think that the people who have bought with the same idea, have found that just because they are tim holtz you must be getting a superior product .Yes as i have read here you can go to u-tube to see how to use, but there again i don't think you should have to go to the extra trouble to be able to use a product it should be included in the packaging....Bummer	-1
The point end practically fell out of both pens--ink everywhere! I ruined one project (then I tossed out the gold one), and then tried the silver one, and ruined a pair of jeans when the point unit dislodged. Very messy, and the ink is permanent.  I'll be trying another brand/type of metallic pen in the future.	-1
problem with ink  coming out in blobs	-1
I bought these because ultra fine sharpies don't show up on dark glass that I cut for mosaics and the regular silver and gold only comes with fat tips, so I thought I'd try this. Horrible on glass! Smears everywhere and comes out in blobs and has to be stored on their sides.  So now I'm still stuck trying to squint and see my lines on dark colored glass sheets. UGH. Sharpie please create an ultra fine/fine silver or gold or white!!!	-1
they leak or they are not writing at all, hate it...	-1
This stuff is super bleedy. You can be super careful and ink just spills all over whatever your using it on. Not ever using these again.	-1
Hope to refuse and not worry about returning	-1
Gold marker cap is suck on and won't come off but silver works well. Although it did sort of splatter and ruin (or add character if you're being nice) my wedding signature book.	-1
Had good hopes for this. But, metallic markers are very hard to find. Bright and sparkly seem to be promised, but are not delivered. Gold turns either watery brown or is dull to the point of looking tan when it dries. Silver is just dull grey.	-1
So disappointed! Brand new, and they don't work- unless you want pool of gold and silver ink on paper. They don't write at all. They scratch, and all the ink comes from me pressing down. The quality is terrible. Too bad.	-1
At first I was amazed by the silver marker: you can get a very smooth and clear line without much effort, and the distribution of metallic pigment is even. The golden one was a catastrophe: on the third shake after it stopped writing yet again, and I was trying to make it as shiny as the silver one, lots of ink came out all over the place, also on fabric. You cannot get it out with neither water nor alcohol even immediately after s spill.	-1
Bought this as a gift and it could easily be something one would find at the Dollar Store for a buck.  You have to mix the paint....Not impressed.	-1
This set of art is very hard to see and follow. Following the coloring is very hard. Its also not easy to see. I would not purchase this again.	-1
One of things I don't like about this Pencil by Number Flower and Pets Variety Pack is that  the drawing was too light for me to make out enough to color. I could hardly see what was printed on there. It wasn't worth the money I paid for it.	-1
Extremely thin with little pigment in it.  Requires multiple coats for even the most basic application.  Very disappointing.	-1
Don't buy this! The smell is like a dead skunk and it won' t go away. I've aired it out for days and sprayed it with orange scent in hopes of making it smell better. Nothing works.	-1
These watercolors are so tiny. Not what I expected. Sent back.	-1
NOT THE SOME COLOR INDIAN YELLOW I HAD FROM BOB ROSS.. ITS MORE LIKE  AN OCHRE COLOR. ALSO THE TUBE HAD OIL ALL OVER IT.  WHEN I OPENED THE PACKAGE , WHAT A MESS THE TUBE WAS LEAKING IT'S OIL AND NOT THE RIGHT COLOR FOR INDIAN YELLOW....... I'M VERY DISAPOINTED IN WINSOR / NEWTON.  MIKE FROM MARYLAND  11/7/17	-1
Old stock. Very old indeed Oil leaking from top. This indicates exposure to drastic tempature changes and the separation Of color from binder Tubes looks old and beatup Another shoddy price of art material  from Amazon	-1
all excited about my new cad red opened up the tube and half oozed out ,first and only time this happened not upset winsor newton still good paint ,I just caught the ooooozzzzzer..	-1
does not work well with ruler for cutting quilt squares and strips	-1
I received a straight edge blade and not a pinking blade.  Very disappointed with that aspect.  Waiting to see if it will be replaced.	-1
Blade developed a nick almost immediately. I take very good care of blades. It might have been defective from the get-go. At any rate, I have to buy another.	-1
I attached it to my 45mm rotary cutter and not only did it stick all the time, it did not cut very well; and with type of cut, you want it to cut right the first time, every time. I had high hopes, but was very disappointed.	-1
I don't know if it's this brand or if I just got a bad blade, but it wouldn't even cut through one layer of fabric. It felt dull to the touch. I ended up just throwing it away and using my pinking sheers instead. It was very disappointing, a waste of time and money.	-1
Good thing this tube is so big. Very thin paint. Doesn't cover at all. Also paint was separated and even upon shaking to mix, it did not.	-1
First of all it is important that I bout phthalo blue, received a tube that said phthalo blue, but the paint inside was NOT phthalo blue. I bought this paint as a comparison between Winsor & Newton and Liquitex professional and student paints. In order to compare I did a simple gradient test to find the truest and birghtest color when mixed with white. I find it important to note that the professional Winsor and Newton uses the same pigments as the Liqutex student paint. I found that Winsor and Liquitex professional pains have  the same degree of pigment saturation. However Liquitex professional had the brightest color when mixed with white. Liquitex student paint was only slightly duller than the professional and a closer comparison to Winsor professional. The Winsor student paint was not phthalo blue as I expected and had a very strong green shade. By all standards Liquitex professional was the best pain by being true to the expected color, having a high degree of pigment saturation, and remaining bright after being mixed with white. Winsor professional and Liquitex student tie for second though price would put Liquitex ahead. Winsor professional had a higher saturation but was not as bright when mixed with white and compared to Liquitex student. Winsor student pain comes in dead last by an long shot. The paint is the completely wrong color though its pigmentation states that it should be the same as Liquitex professional. The degree of saturation is far less that any of the other paints and it is greatly dulled by the white paint. Final rankings: 1. Liquitex professional 2. Liquitex student 3. Winsor & Newton professional 4. great dissapointment 5. Winsor & Newton Student I will be buying Liquitex paints for my art.	-1
this is horrible paint and like tinted whipped  cream.  do not recommend at all	-1
The blade that came with my rotary cutter was warped. So it did not cut a clean line. I only know this because I bought a spare blade from another company and put the new blade in, and it worked. The packaging of my blade was also in Japanese. This is not a big deal, but when I get things like this I wonder if they were purchased defective and then passed on to me. So maybe be careful with the seller.	-1
...frankly, I'm not seeing much of a difference between this and the Liquitex Basics. And, it has a strong ammonia smell. I pass.	-1
not the color I had hoped....an awful yellow	-1
I sketch with charcoal so I prefer newsprint, or any cheap paper for that matter. But I wanted to try something new and this also offered a different tone. I was really excited knowing it's really hard to find cool colors other than white and gray. When I unrolled it, it was just thin translucent tissue paper and realized it was not sketching paper at all. After staring at this for a while, I said, "what can it hurt?" So i gave it a try, sketching with soft charcoal, and it still warped and cut through the paper. In the description, it said you could use marker or even pencil on it. I wouldn't recommend it. So those of you out there that have the same idea, all I can say is that you'd be more satisfied sketching on cheap toilet paper, but on the upside I have cool tissue paper now.  :)	-1
Letters are very small	-1
cheap letter stickers, there are no straight lines, every letter looks like it was cut out with a guy with a serious shaking hand, they are not very sticky, and they fall off the backing easily.  don't do as they advise and pull off the unused portion so only the letters are left, because it willl pull off half the letters and periods, commas and all the small stuff.  I don't know if its because they are only 1/2 inch, aybe they would be cleaner cuts if they were biger letters, I don't know, it seems like they use a melting process to cut the letters out?  for what I need this is good enough, but if you are looking for something nice and clean, find a different brand.	-1
Not really thrilled with these for coloring books. They did not lay down smooth and were scratch and uneven in color...  I was disappointed as I had really liked the color range.  Could be the paper in the books, but I have tried them on all sorts of paper, cardstock etc and just not good. If you are getting them for kids to use then I am sure they will be fine. I'll stick with my Bic and Sharpies and Steadtler pens	-1
why did I even buy these...get the crayola ones....these are expensive for no good reason....	-1
These markers bleed when I use them in my Adult Coloring Book. Disappointed.	-1
These markers were dried out very disappointing  I didn't go after a return because I refuse to pay return shipping while it's possible it's a fluke one or two being dried out is a fluke all dried out disappointing	-1
Not a fan! I am not sure if I am a one off here, but I got this to color in a adult coloring book and mine were dry and brittle. They balled up and ripped the secret garden coloring book. This was very disappointing as I had heard wonderful things about these markers.	-1
Outer color of marder doesn't match actual marker color and several arrived dried out.	-1
These pens are nice enough but I won't buy them again.  In fact, I'm giving them to my daughter or grand daughter.  The colors don't even come close to the colors on the pens.  They are all very dark, and ones that look like they should be pastel, are not.  The tips are nice to work with, but colors are not.	-1
I HATE these markers! They are no better than dollar store quality. The paper "pills" when using them. Some colors arrived almost dry, no flow at all a big waste of money.	-1
I just bought one of those cute adult coloring books and was in between pencils and markers. Bought these and they seemed dry. Very uneven color, hated them.	-1
Worked great for a little while then quickly dried up	-1
Big Waste of Money.  Sent these back.  So disappointed.  The tips feather and leave fuzziness behind and you have to "clean" the tips before reusing to wipe off the fuzz.  Colors were okay but 30 out of 36 had fuzz issues so these were no good for me.  The Bic Mark-It markers (both ultra fine and fine) were 3,000 times better than these and the colors were better too.	-1
These are a huge disappointment. I read a lot of reviews (on these and other similar markers) before buying these and don't understand the positive ones for this product. Here are the problems with it: 1- The actual colors do not match the cap colors, they are much more intense. So, for a good art project they are essentially unusable. 2- They dry out! After coloring one small area, maybe 4"x2", they dry out. Replacing the cap means that the next day they will color a bit more but that is hardly practical. The only good thing about them is that the tips are very nice but with not enough ink, and unreliable color matching, they are really not worth buying, at any price.	-1
Not what I expected. Somehow I assumed this green was going to be rich, clear and super green. The color I got was a yucky, milky, pale green. Super disappointed! Still on the lookout for a rich deep green.	-1
This is NOT PY153 for new gamboge as stated in the ad.  It's actually PY150/PR209.  Haven't decided if I'm keeping it or not.	-1
I am giving this product ONE star to call attention to the warning label on the side of the jar.  It says"Warning:  This product contains a chemical known to the State of CA to cause cancer."  Whether or not this could be a remote truth I do not want to use a product that states this caveat.  I am sure (from reading the other reviews) that this might be an awesome art product, but I'd rather see a label that is positive.	-1

Sadly the case didn't make it through many uses.  The fasteners are so thinly made they are useless.  I have found the oils take a really long time to dry.  I won't be back.  :(	-1
I usually love royal langnickel  products and hav bought many of them in the past, including sets for painting and drawing. Usually I find the sets to be high quality and contain nice materials, paints, brushes, markers, etc. However, I was incredibly disappointed with this item...It is NOTworth the price that  paid for it, and that says something because I bought it while it was on lightning deal. Details:  Pros: The box that everything comes in seems to be pf a decent quality, it is wood. It's nicely colored, and latches well. The paints seem to be of  good quality. I haven't had any issues with them.  Cons: The brushes it came with seem to be low quality. They don't snap back when you test them, and are rather disappointing to use. They leave fibers everywhere. The paint tray that the item comes with is an incredibly flimsy, cheap, breakable tray. This is the most disappointing item of all as it was one of the main reasons I bought the set. The tray looked useful from the pictures.... It's not at all. It's horrible.  For the price, I would definitely NOT recommend this product. The quality is just sub par compared to other similar products of this type.	-1
low quality, reaaly low. charcoals don't even smudge	-1
The box just fell apart when I opened it. The brush. Holder was poorly designed. Very poor product. On the upside Amazon' return service was excellent. Also this company does make a quality product that is similar just not this one.	-1
The item arrived looking good enough but as soon as I opened it, the back of the box fell off. The more I touched it the more pieces came off.	-1
This was an affordable set of watercolors and brushes for a beginner. The first thing that happened is that the inside tray ( a paper thin plastic ) came loose... Where the paints are supposed to be held tight in place, they now flip out along with the entire tray. It's not a "neat" little kit since everything is a big mess when you've closed it up and it's a lot of trouble to get it all back where things belong. The brushes are hard to access because they have layered them with a bit of an offset. ( one part of the set is under the other part )... This is a simple kit of paints and brushes. Don't expect to be wowed or super happy - expect to get some paint and some brushed and a box. The plastic liner is what makes it cheap.	-1
the case was broken when it arrived. I was less than thrilled with it. I guess I just got a bad one...	-1
I don't know if I got a odd one, but something isn't right with these.  Only just over 1 inch cuts well, not toward the tip, not toward the handle.  :(  Pretty much useless. I'm looking for another brand to buy.  UPDATE: 04/11/2016 - I had put these away because they were annoying and useless. I forgot about that and just tried to use them again  USELESS.  To the trash they go, I wouldn't even donate these for some other person to waste their money on.  :(	-1
Sorry, Allary, but these were blunt and I returned them for a more pricey and different brand.  I didn't want to take a chance with a replacement.  No questions asked, so I was very pleased with the return policy, thank you.	-1
These won't even cut through one layer of fabric cleanly.  It seemed like a good deal, but next time I think I'll spend the few extra dollars on a better pair.	-1
So disappointed.  These broke after 2 uses.  Plastic cheap and just cracked, metal shears crossed and stuck and could not be opened.  Very cheap manufacturing!	-1
It didn't stay sharp and would pull and snap material. Not what I had in mind when I purchased it.	-1
Really disappointed in these! They're dull in certain spots and don't "pink" right and have ruined one of my projects.	-1
Sent it back because it was awful quality and not as pictured! The point was dull and the handle was a rough finish!	-1
