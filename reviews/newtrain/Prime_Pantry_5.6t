Just like I remembered	1
the family loves these	1
They don't taste as good as they did when I was young, but my kids don't know that so they liked them. The cake is much denser than it used to be. The inside fluff part - whatever that is - seems to be about the same. Even thought they are different than I remember, I still liked them. I did not like that a lot of the cake stuck to the cardboard they sit on. I don't remember them being so sticky, but that just might be a flaw in my memory and they have always been like that.	1
Yuck. Tasted terrible...and the taste stayed in my mouth for a while after (need lots of water!).	-1
Not very good at all . Highly disappointed with Hostess.	-1
These are gross! NOT worth the calorie expenditure IMO, I thought they would taste like YODELS which i LOVE< but they're not even close and they are wicked expensive! I thought I was getting 3 BOXES by the misleading description!	-1
wonderful cake and chocolate coating.  the white filling is great.	1
I could live on these.	1
Perfect	1
yummmmmmmmy	1
The family loves these hoho's	1
The best Swiss-style cake roll on the market!  Always fresh and tasty, and easy to eat.	1
time to order more	1
pies did not taste good and filling was dry	-1
Kind of stale	-1
Horrible.  Dry, crumbly, filling hard.  Had to throw them away.  Inedible.  Would give ZERO stars if possible.	-1
Received with 10 days until expiration and they were molded. When I opened the box it was an overwhelming smell of must. The box was stained, the individual pie boxes were stained, the pies were molded on the outside, and the inside filling was clear not yellow. I used to love the lemon pies and was really looking forward to receiving these but into the garbage they go.	-1
So DRY!  Save your money these are not like the drakes.	-1
45 seconds in the microwave, and enjoy with a tall glass of milk and welcome to delicioustown - population - you.	1
These are actually pretty good. I wish they had a fresher texture. They are good, but they are like day old cinnamon rolls. Pretty good in a pinch though.	1
stale dry	-1
Very good microwaved about 12 seconds. Tastes warm, soft & just baked.	1
My absolutely favorite cinnamon roll to have in the morning along with a cup of black coffee. Without this in the morning the day is a waste!!	1
These are very good!! Came fresh and packaged good.. First time. I've had these.. Ali will buy again!	1
best rolls for the money, will order again......	1
Expires July 16, 2016. Filling thick and old. Questionable...	-1
very good pastry; love these in my lunches...	1
What's not to love!	1
Read my review for the Hostess apple pies.  Don't buy them!  Does hostess have a new Owner since the day they stopped production for a while?	1
rubbery, small, not at all what I remembered.	-1
Good	1
EXCELLENT BUY	1
Yummy!	1
I normally LOVE LOVE pies. But I bought 2 boxes of lemon and the filling was hard. I thought it would be a little bit softer. I ended up throwing them all out to the birds and squirrels and even the chimpmunks loved them. I may try from another site to see if it is how they were stored before sending. Also it was very close to expiration date. I never thought to see when they expire. I ASSUMED they would be fresh. Oops. Never assume.	-1
just like grandma used to make	1
Just say NO to these gelatinous, calorie filled little pieces of fat.  Not all that tasty, either.	-1
too tart, tastes artificial	-1
Yummy, love these.	1
I ordered these waxing nostalgia and afterwards read a few reviews and got worried. I dunno why. They were the same great tasting pies I remember as a child. I swear most things shrank but these sure did not. I did not get dry pies nor did I get an artificially tasting pie. They were quite delicious and my son and husband enjoyed them as well. Only problem I had was I should have ordered more. :P	1
ULLTRA SWEET	1
With all the orders I have received from Amazon this is the only item I thought necessary to post a negative review was excited to get these ate them years ago was so dissapointed they had a strange smell to them the crust I guess and as per other review soooo sugery really not good threw them out.	-1
YUM!	1
Great snack to have on hand.	1
Not sure why, but there is an oily taste when eating these directly from the package. Also, oil on the roof of my mouth and not very chocolate-y. I put them in the microwave for about 15-20 seconds and they were delicious. Just an FYI	1
I don't know if I just got an older box, but I thought these tasted very stale and plastic-y, and they were slightly melted from the transport.  I love sweets and donuts, and I thought this would be perfect.  I ended up throwing almost half the box away.	-1
These Donettes were not what I expected.  The ones I received were not fresh; they were very waxy.  Not sure if that's truly how they are or if it was due to the packs not being fresh.	-1
Absolutely disgusting foul taste, I ended up throwing them in the trash.  Tasted like chemicals	-1
Delicious!!	1
I have not had these for years and I use to love them. The filling use to be like pie filling with whole cherries. They are just not the same and I don't care for them at all.	-1
Again ours went out of date before the month was up	-1
They say Americans will eat anything if wrapped in sugar and fried in grease this proves it. Artificial flavor tasted like cough syrup. Cardboard soaked in sugar filled with more sickly glop reminded me of You Tube videos of fake foods sold in China.	-1
Arrived only two days before their expiration date, gross!	-1
Excellent when fresh.  Crisp shell and perfect filling.  Ate these for lunch all the time in high school.  Just like I remember them still.	1
not so much	1
Thank You	1
These are nice little fruit pies, but a little dry.  The crust is tender and chewy with a delicious sweet glaze on top.  The filling is sticky and dry.  Perhaps I am spoiled for comforts her, with Krispy kreme being my favorite hand pie. These little three inch by three inch pies are still fruity and tasty.  I would suggest a cup of tea or coffee with them as a nice pick me up.	1
They were rotten when they arrived!	-1
Yummy	1
She's my cherry pie	1
Awful. Truly awful. Stale, crumbly, greyish, bland, and nasty. The filling is like a bland paste. These used to be good. The box I got was only a couple weeks from expiration when I received it. Will not buy again.	-1
These were terrible. I'm not sure if they were just really stale, or if the recipe has changed for the worse. The glaze on the outside of the pie was a weird tan color and hard. The crust was too thick and almost crunchy-hard. The filling was dry, gummy and tasteless. The pies are in little boxes, which can't possibly keep them fresh-why aren't they in sealed bags like they used to be? Disappointing.	-1
What can i say, i like junk food  If the small square version of hostess pies had this cherry filling i'd be very happy	1
Kind of stale	-1
My grandkids favorite	1
fantastic , the old flavor is back, they no longer taste like cheap, artificial goo!	1
good for you	1
GREAT PRODUCT!  WOULD BUY FROM SELLER AGAIN!!!	1
l love cherry pie	1
These are great for my son. I'm not a cherry pie lover so these are great for me. Now my son can have his cherry pie more often .	1
always a favorite for lunches or a quick snack.	1
These pies are delicious! Cherry is my second favorite flavor, and apple is my first. If you are looking for snack pies, then Hostess is the best you can get!	1
Grease stains on each individual box w/pie in it inside the bigger box was NOT appealing;  pies were like a mouth-full of cheap gummy artificial flavor cherry. Not at all like the Hostess fruit pies I used to buy individually packaged in the grocery stores in waxed paper wrappers. These were smaller also.  Definitely not worth the $6.00 a box purchase price.  Would never buy these again.	-1
Love the Cherry pie by Hostess !! Taste soooo good !!! Thank u !!	1
Fresh and yummy - just like I remember as a child! They were packed with care, shipped quickly, and so delicious that they didn't last nearly as long as I thought they might. We devoured them without shame! The pastry was fresh, flaky, and lightly glazed while inside were delicious, tender, and juicy cherries that sure didn't disappoint. If you like cherry pie, and don't have the time to bake your own, then I highly recommend these - if you can find them! I went to re-order and found them no longer offered. I sure hope that changes soon!	1
Tasty	1
Wonderful for sweet-tooth!  Still healthy!	1
Great Product	1
These are really awful. Beyond the overly sugared "shell" there is an amazing amount of red goo and 2 or 3 "cherries" that at no time whatsoever taste anything like cherry.	-1
I don't know if my adult palate has changed my taste for junk food, but these didn't taste good. Maybe they never did, but the dough is so heavy and there wasn't enough filling(not that it tasted good either)	-1
Arrived as advertised and as scheduled	1
Arrived on September 3 with a "best by September 12" date stamp. Individual boxes unsealed on the ends. Pie shells dry and cracked with filling oozed out. Awful. Won't order these again.	-1
A great snack food.	1
taste great!!! of course it is all wasted calories, food coloring, and all that stuff that is bad for you but we all have our weaknesses, indulge every once in a while	1
Awful. These arrived tasting entirely foreign to what I used to know. The crust was very thick, stiff, and stale. The filling was completely tasteless. In fact, the only "taste" was the awful crust. Have not been able to force another one into my mouth, and I threw away the rest of what I had tried. Sorry that I ordered two boxes without checking to see if the product was worth even one box.	-1
That's right, more fruit pies. I do share you know. Hubby loves them. Again, not every day. More like one or two a week. It's best to look forward to a treat than to eat them all and feel sick about how many you had.	1
I limited myself to one a day, like a vitamin.  they are really really good	1
This cherry pie is really too sweet.  The crust has sort of a sugar coating.  I suspect that is on there to keep the pie from sticking to the box.  The crust is very thick.  There is not a lot of cherry filling compared to the amount of crust, and what filling there is has more the texture of thick jelly with only a few cherry pieces in it.  This is more like a cherry pastry than a cherry pie.	-1
Not the hostess cherry pies of old.  Taste was terrible, like eating gooey plastic with a strong chemical flavor that was slight cherry.  I saw no cherries just some kind of red jelly like paste. Awful.	-1
Very good. Reminded me of the fried pies I got as a kid.	1
When I bought these, I thought they were a different product.  The ones I've had in the past were smaller and a littler more tart.  These are very sweet and more sugary and tart and fruity.  They're surprisingly moist and have a great texture.  I like the cherry flavor but I wish they were more tart.	1
very good.	1
These cupcakes will definitely satisfy a chocolate craving. The cake alone is pretty dense and then you still get the chocolate punch from the frosted top. This box holds 2-packs which are suitable for packing in a lunch, since each cupcake is protected nside a plastic sleeve molded to exactly its circular shape. The recipe seems a little different than the Hostess Cup Cakes from my youth, but the taste is very good regardless.	1
These are still as good as I remember them. Hadn't had these for years and I saw them and bought them. They are still fresh and really good.	1
My son loved these cup cakes and all Hostess products when he was growing up. Now, he eats a very healthy diet, and it is rare that he has a treat like this. For his birthday, I decided to order these cup cakes for a surprise.  The cup cakes are chocolate with a white filling and covered with chocolate glaze. I would assume they are not as they were 30 years ago, but are made with less healthy ingredients. But, this is a one time treat, and I doubt he will have more than one. It will bring back memories of days of yore, and that will be fun.  Good going, Hostess!  Recommended For A Treat. prisrob 09-18-17	1
Hostess cupcakes, you gotta love 'em!	1
Great	1
I have tried many Hostess products over the years and liked most of them,  but out of all the hostess products my favorite has always been the Hostess chocolate cup cakes (with sweet cream filling 6 two packs size).  In fact I purchase these delicious chocolate cream filled cupcakes just about every week.  If you like chocolate cupcakes you may want to check out this Hostess brand.  They are sold on Amazon as well as most other grocery stores like Jewel and large stores like Wal-Mart.  Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Martial Art and Warrior Haiku and Senryu)	1
These arrived in my 1st  Prime Fresh order.  They were undamaged and delicious!	1
yummy	1
VERY MOIST & FLAVORFUL! LONG EXPIRATION DATE. NICE FOR A SNACK. FAIR PRICE. FAST SHIPPING. I RECOMMEND. I THINK THIS NEW 19 WORDS A MUST FOR REVIEWS IS RIDICULOUS.	1
As usual it works great	1
I got lucky with mine...they were super fresh and delicious. They are definitely smaller than they used to be, which is disappointing. I'm going to take a chance and order them again because the ones I got were so yummy. Much fresher than I've ever gotten in a store. For a prepackaged cupcake, these are a good buy.	1
We rarely purchase frivolous calories, but this is one of our favorite comfort foods.  Having the twin packs helps us with portion control, too!	1
Great product from a great seller	1
dry and quished	-1
My Husband and I love hostess and sometimes we get in a little sweet tooth craving and we buy Hostess	1
Did not need getting to fat , but real good	1
I was quite impressed that these didn't come all mashed up because Pantry does seem to do that quite a bit. This was all nostalgia factor for me. Of course they're fantastic if you really are thinking about the actual taste, but to me, these taste like childhood and I don't feel like they've varied from when I was a kid (as some reviewers have mentioned) so that's enough for me to love them!	1
Good value.	1
Stale and had 5 weeks remaining before it's "Best By" date.	-1
Contains beef fat for some silly reason, and it's buried in the middle of the tiny ingredient list. Really disappointed in the product because of this, really deceptive for a freaking cupcake.	-1
these taste just like the cup cakes I get locally. I like that they come in a handy 2 pack. that is a convenient proportion unless you want 3 of them, then you are out of luck. buy with confidence	1
amazing. really really fresh! and a Good Grab for a Prime Box.	1
The old fashioned flavor and quality is finally back!  YEAH !	1
We love these!!!!!	1
Not a healthy snack but my family loves it.	1
I purchased these cupcakes on a whim as snacks for my children. So far, our little one has enjoyed his treat for the day. I tasted a cupcake and found it to be very fresh and tasty. I suppose I could eat the entire box if I let myself. They do seem to be slightly smaller than they once were. That would be my only complaint. They arrived on time and were packaged well and were absolutely fresh.	1
ty	1
I like the 2 pack but they were a little on the dry side.	1
Box damaged and cupcakes stale	-1
Great product, great buy	1
Protect was stale.  Only had 1 week before date exp.	-1
Additive	1
The kids loved them	1
Brings me back to my childhood.  Yum	1
wow! delicious! fresh! my cup cakes arrived yesterday. i just opened up one pack of them. the freshness date was january 16, 2016. i could see that the bottoms were moist. so i bit into one and it was very delicious and soft. the aroma is excellent. there was no damage of this product in my prime pantry box delivery. i finished off the pack of two cup cakes. the others will not last long. i have to finish up the entire box before i order any more though.	1
Great Product	1
Fresh and tasty!  Great snack!	1
Chocolate cupcakes. What's not to love?	1
No issues	1
they were so close to expiration date. we were surprised. a little dry too.	1
Not like the old Hostess at all.	-1
Don't buy food from Amazon...way too expensive.	-1
NOT as I remembered from my childhood.  Frosting on the tops was dried out and crumbly (As a child, I recall that peeling off the top frosting layer was my method of consumption, NOT possible with these), very little creamy filling in the middle.  Over all, an incredibly poor facsimile of the original Hostess Cupcakes that most of us knew and loved.  Sad, and incredibly disappointing.	-1
They were all fresh, everything was good. Chocolate was good, creme center was good. Again, none of these were expired.	1
great with your morning cup of coffee.	1
Can't eat just one.	1
FRESH!	1
A	1
Great Product	1
I know the donettes are good if they're fresh.  The box was partially opened, the expiration date is in 2 weeks and they feel kind of hard.  We'll see.	1
Fine	1
Arrived with only 8 days 'freshness' on them.  They were hard and appeared wet.  The ones bought in the store are much softer and fresher.  Definitely not a product to purchase for home delivery.	-1
My box was very close to expiration date and a little dried out ...should have been in the dumpster	-1
As expected, yummy!	1
I purchase these to fill the break room with for the guys. They love them thank you!	1
Ugh!  Very disappointed.  Ever since Hostess company was sold, these donuts are NOT the original taste.  Tasted terrible.  I could only eat one.  Husband isn't picky and he eats his with coffee.  Watch the expiration date.  I just received mine and they expire in 9 days.  BOOO.	-1
There are few things I enjoy in life. this is one of them.	1
They were dry and had to be tossed out!	-1
Not like the old Hostess at all.	-1
great cheese Danish!  wish they were available today so I could re-order today.	1
No problems. Too good for me to order again	1
yummy	1
Same delicious Snow Balls. Fresh, moist, wonderful! LOL	1
husband loves these!	1
The expiration was only three days away once delivered. The food product was dry and actually hard. We couldn't eat this and it wasn't allowed to be returned. This actually happened to MOST of the food items in my order. What a waste of money. It all went into the trash. So upset about this. I will never order food from online again.	-1
good childhood snack....	1
Great snacks for everyone!	1
k	1
very good	1
received just fine	1
My husband loves these.  We ordered a box thinking they would be as pictured white with chocolate filling.  Well the ones we received were colored green, assuming for St. Patrick's day.  He was a little disappointed in the color but they tasted the same.	1
enjoyed these!	1
these were small and tasted terrible.	-1
Fresh and oh so good.  Sno balls are the best!	1
these are great with hot cocoa	1
Great, fresh, just like I remember them!	1
Glad to see Snowballs back on the market.  Delicious as always!  Shared with my son-in-law.	1
Expiration date 9/6/16, delivered 8/31/16	-1
Are not the way I remember them when I was young.  But then what is?	-1
Snowballs are always great!!	1
my experience with ordering and consuming this product is all good. the aroma was good. i love the coconut. the filling was good. the chocolate cake was good. it arrived for me with no damage. the snoballs were pretty fresh and a joy to consume. i am going to try out some of my other hostess favorites.	1
yum	1
Well packaged, nice and fresh..will order again...happy	1
excellent buy	1
I think either Hostess changed their ingredients or this was just plain stale.	-1
Takes me back to school days and lunch bags. Love these things, my favorite are the pink ones.	1
Good product.	1
The very best in cake.  Yummy	1
Good	1
Left things smelling good	1
These are a great price and smell wonderful!  Love these in closets and bathroom.  Really like the purple colors.  Needed two in larger rooms.  Will order again.	1
I like this for towels and washcloths and things you want stain-free without using smelly bleach. I find it works well and recommend Amazon's household staples delivery as a way of buying in bulk and not having to load and unload these heavy items as you would in a warehouse club.	1
For the dirtiest of laundry ... only Oxiclean will do!!!!  Not just a commercial, a reality.  This product can get your clothes clean and fresh - we are believers!	1
Oxiclean is a very amazing product. Where you thought stains were there for life and an item ruined this product nearly always saves my items from ruin. It is easy to use and I find it extremely economical for the little miracles it does.	1
Our go-to stain fighter for laundry loads. Really boosts colors and fights dinginess thats been lingering!	1
Husband got new tat and got blood and ink on new sheets.  This got it all out good as new!	1
I like this better than using bleach in a whole load, when I really only need it for a few spots on a single item. Bleach doesn't work on everything, of course, and sometimes I think the pen gets a little clogged up. For the most part, I'm happy with the purchase.	1
as described	1
I add Oxi Clean to my laundry every time and believe that the colors have stayed fresher as a result.	1
Great in the washing machine-- gives towels and clothes a nice fresh but not perfume smell. Did not work as well on cleaning the shower. Seemingly had no effect on mildew.	1
I've always liked oxi clean but recently I had a mud stain that had set in to cream colored pants. I followed the directions and had the pants soaking for more than 24 hours. I also scrubbed but didn't remove the stain. Not sure if I just had too high of hopes or what. Was disappointed.	1
Arrived in a timely manner with quality as expected. Oxi Clean is the best. I love it for all kinds of cleaning projects, not the least of which is laundry. Remember a little bit goes a long way!! Very effective product. Thank you.	1
handy for a smally spot before the wash.	1
This product is getting harder to find.  It's a great item for those hard to treat spots on white clothing.  A common occurrence for me.  There must be a Murphy's Law regarding  the direct relationship between wearing white and the propensity to spill something...say red wine.  If you need a bib whenever you eat, add this to your arsenal of cleaning tools.  Great price, too.	1
perfect	1
great for crafts	1
Works great on stains. just what I needed.	1
Cleaning product	1
I've used this product many times and love it. It's not as strong as straight bleach so I usually have to use several times on black marker stains. For me that's good. I have never had clothing or my mattress damaged from the pen whereas bleach has eaten holes in clothing. The pen is small enough to carry with me and yes I am that messy. Gemhhunter	1
My grandson is in college & got ink all over several items of clothing! This took care of the problem! LOVE IT!	1
Love this stuff!	1
Great cleaner!	1
I love the color! And fragrance!  But, it cleans well.  It has successfully removed stains from my floor and white sink that others could not. I like this lighter lavender fragrance--much better than pine.  :)	1
Heavenly scent!	1
Nice smell, works well on floors.	1
I bought this bleach pen to spot treat light clothes before the wash and it works great. Beware though, it has a strong bleach smell since it is concentrated. But I like how it has two tips (one smaller for more precise dispersion and another bigger brush-like one). However I do realize that a huge container of liquid bleach is of better value, yet this pen is ideal for spot treating (and won't get bleach on your hands which is a plus). I do hope my review is also helpful in your own purchasing decisions!	1
I have not used it yet, but clorox is a great product.	1
Doesn't work on tile or cleaning hard to reach places, like on commercials.	-1
Good product! Loooooove Colorox products, and this is no exception. Really whacks the ink stains on husbands white uniform shirts!	1
I was surprised to find the pen was two-ended. I found using the larger end with the plastic bristles to be very helpful. I hadn't had a bleach pen for awhile and am wondering why because they are so handy. Yes, it's more expensive than using a bottle of bleach but it's so contained. I'm glad Clorox came up with a gel.	1
Great!	1
Perfect size for your diaper bag.  Great to have on hand to save all of those cutsie clothes from whatever your child gets into before you can get home to treat stain!	1
Doesn't run!  Great for cleaning grout and for bleaching away small stains.	1
I use this for crafting fabric design. It suits my needs and I am happy with the flow and control I have over how the pen delivers the bleaching agent. I am pleased with my purchase.	1
Excellent product (and has been for many years).	1
This is my favorite cleaner for tile floors. Doesn't leave a residue and smells clean.	1
recommended by my friend.	1
smells great	1
good cleaner and the smell last long	1
Weird smell, not like lavender but like a musty hospital smell.  I  will stick to the good old regular pine scent from now on.	-1
nice to use.  smells very pleasant.	1
This has a nice clean scent that lingers well after cleaning. So if your wife asks you to mop the floors, do some laundry, change the sheets, mow the grass, and make her a chicken potpie and she comes home early to find you still sitting in your underwear on the couch while the baby plows through a bag of hot Cheetos, she won't even be mad if you did manage to clean at least the floor by the front door.  This stuff smells so good she'll think the whole house is clean and since it has calming lavender in it, it'll calm her right down. Maybe she'll even sit down next to you on the couch in HER underwear, whip out a fresh bag of Taco Bell and watch the game with you while the baby falls into a long nap from the scent of the calming lavender in Pine Sol.  It could happen.	1
Great kit! Get it and make your life easy..	1
Used on the outside windows of our new fifth wheel . The rod reaches well and the windows sparkle with no streaks or film. No need to wipe to dry just follow directions . Wash off with hose then clean with the windex cleaning pad then just hose off to rinse and let dry. Nice product.	1
Works great, does an awesome job cleaning	1
Awesome product!	1
Worked perfectly for us. The extended handle is about 11 feet and by standing on a short step ladder, my husband was able to reach the highest windows of our house. The Windex cleaning pad did an excellent job of loosening the dirt and the hose water washed it away, leaving no streaks.	1
Makes the job a little easier.	1
Works good.	1
handy, easy to use for job nobody likes to do	1
I like to use this in my kitchen. It doesn't have a bad bleach smell.	1
One of my favorite products. YOU can use this on mirrors..anywhere. And doesn't get the lungs as bad as strong bleach:)	1
Great	1
Good for daily use.	1
Love this stuff	1
I like this product for cleaning my kitchen and bathroom at the end of the day. It's a maintenance product, and that is what I use it for. Does the job well.	1
Good product for a quick wipe over your counters.  I have cats who don't know their place is on the floor so this is a quick and convenient way to clean my counters off first thing in the morning and before I start cooking.	1
you name it I sprayed it . good product for the price.	1
Really good, has the Clorox smell, and I am and will always be a great fan of anything Clorox.	1
love that i can take this from room to room and know the bleach inside will kill the germs whether your in the bathroom or kitchen	1
Easy to use. Not Harsh. Lasts awhile. Great disinfecting product. But definitely pricey.	1
Easy to use and necessary to disinfect all winter long.	1
It's Clorox...top of the line product.  I always buy this.	1
Arrived in good order.	1
Great smell and does a great job. The only flaw I have to mention is that the dispenser on this and any other version never works for me. I always end up taking the top off.	1
Good	1
I've used this spray for several years. I like the idea of a non harming sanitizing spray that can be used around pets and children.	1
Can always depend on good old Clorox to do the job!	1
Product is a great value and well-priced. The best part is that I can avoid Walmart, because with Pantry, it comes straight to my front door.	1
The scent is overwhelming... Otherwise the product works very well.	-1
Works great.  Highly recommended	1
Very pleasant fragrance as well as effective	1
has a very nice smell, can be used on anything and they are not flushable.	1
Works great in the bathroom!	1
Everything arrived as expected Great Company	1
Thank you	1
this is the brand i use and i find they durable and lavender smells is nice	1
Love the scent of these! It is lavender but not delicate since they are disinfecting wipes. I keep them in the laundry, bathroom, and outside. Can't have enough and you won't find this scent in stores.	1
Very helpful in the kitchen	1
YUMM	1
Did not like these flavored coffees.  I had hoped for a better quality of taste.  I will stick to my French Roast and other dark roasts without fakey flavor. I would not recommend to others.	-1
This coffee has been a good change from my regular light roast. I purchased one box with four K-Cups of six flavors making a total of twenty-four K-Cups per box. The flavors are: Choc. Coconut Dream, Choc. Chipotle Mole, Peppermint Choco. Mocha, Death By Choco., Italian Choco. Cheesecake, and Choco. Raspberry Truffle. Second box I purchased contained these flavors: Frosted Oatmeal Cookie, Pumpkin Vanilla Creme, Caramel Truffle Sundae, Bananas Foster Flamb, Cinnamon Churro, and Salted Caramel. I have definitely enjoyed these flavors.	1
Exquisite coffee and the multitude of flavors to try is fun!	1
Just me, but the coffee was not good!!	-1
Really enjoyed these coffee flavors.  Raspberry was a personal favorite.  Chipolte Mole was the most unusual.	1
Wonderful price, and love to have the convenience of amazon prime pantry!  The ability to clip coupons on some items is also great!	1
I am enjoying all the lovely flavors in this combo pak.  I found that it is even very flavorful when it gets cold. The flavors are all very precise in their own way.	1
Great product, my office loves these!	1
Love them all. I like some more than others. The peppermint chocolate is good and even better with 1 drop of peppermint oil and 1 extra spoon of chocolate powder. I use stevia in the raw to get a powerful dessert for very few calories.	1
If you like the Crazy Cups brand you will enjoy this variety pack of chocolate and other flavors.  This is my mid-morning treat at the office.	1
I'm not crazy about this sampler.  Some of the cups did not appear to have chocolate in the name, but every one of these cups sure smell great when they are brewing.  I am not too crazy about flavored coffees, but if you like them this might be a good choice for you.	-1
Didn't really care for the coffee tastes in this variety pack.  I understood chocolate and there were only a few CHOCOLATE in there So basically a waste of MY money...	-1
OMG, the flavor of these is so good.  You barely need to use any sugar.	1
works great	1
Perfect	1
Works very well!	1
Very versatile spray freshener that I use to keep laundry basket fresh and in general on bathroom throw rugs and closet floors and other areas where there is no opening window to air out the space. Very dependable product that I can find easily in the local stores but my husband and the grand kids also use this on their HOCKEY GEAR (ugh) so we buy lots of this and the convenience factor is most appreciated. Thank you P&G for making this available on amazon.	1
works great	1
Great Price and Service	1
I love the fragrance, love spraying on my towels and sheets before putting them in my linen closet because it helps them smell fresh.  Although.. I wish the scent lasted longer than a month in the closet.	1
Great!	1
make the sheet smell good for a long time	1
Always works.	1
smells nice like clean laundry	1
Love Febreze ANY FLAVOR (but flowery)!  This one is a fresh laundered smell.	1
Love the smell	1
Yep it's Febreeze	1
Love this scent!!	1
Love Febreze.  But this does not freshen as well as the one with Gain for me.	1
works great	1
These make my house smell great!	1
Who in their right mind would go back to dusting the old way?! These are awesome and they are disposable. I am a dirt and germ phobe type and I love these.	1
Easy to use and really picks up the dust.	1
Nice	1
LOVE SWIFFER	1
great price	1
Just needed some trash bags and these work well.	1
I love swifter. This product is great for people like me that HATE to dust. Makes the job way better & easier. Great product, ok price, & fast shipping. Would recommend.	1
I recently acquired a Swiffer dust wand and I love it.  It makes it much easier to dust without having to get out the spray.  The dust sticks to the pad very with little to no dust flying in the air and it smells great.  Will probably have these for a while because I use the same refill for weeks.	1
As described...	1
They work great	1
another great buy!  great	1
picks up the dust	1
Makes cleaning easier	1
This works grate, but use them once you open the package, they may dry quicker than you want.	1
Swiffer dusters are one of my top 5 household helpers of the century. I love how they catch dust, and that I can shake them outside and they'll go a little farther still. Much better than the dust rag I grew up with. Wouldn't want to try to "keep" a house without these. The only down side to these is the process of "threading" them onto the handle, which slows me down quite a bit, but not a big enough issue to cost it a star. Nice bonus that these are embedded with Febreeze.	1
I use these all the time it catches the dirt instead of spreading it around.	1
great for dusting and then you can throw it away	1
I keep a duster behind the counter at my shop and I love the smell of these. They aren't the best insofar as installing them on the dusting handle, but the smell more than makes up for it. These pick up just as well as any other Swiffer dusting cloth. I've tried a different scent before and these are my favorite.	1
Smell great and work well, but i want to go to something reusable.	1
This item is excellent and i love it for dusting. They are the best for cleaning the ceiling fans, blinds, TV screens, picture frames and more. You can pick up dust from anything, and they are so quick and easy to use. You don't need much effort to use it.	1
Do a good job but have to have either Supreme patience or a Ph.d to figure out how to get these on the pole.	1
Works amazing on Windows!!	1
Great for cleaning windows	1
Great product with great delivery	1
At the time I couldn't find the kind with Febreze at my grocery store (now they have it, but it's more expensive, and you can't buy in bulk, as you can here).  Smells nice and does the job.	1
ok	1
great	1
I love Windex window pads. So easy to use and one little pad will literally wash all the windows in my home as well as my Mother inlaws home next door! We have 14 windows in our house and my Mother in law has about the same. Super simple to use with the pole kit. Just attach the pad and lightly spray with water. Water your window down and begin washing. Then rinse and move onto the next window! Always dries sparking clean and streak free, even with our hard well water. For me these are a real life saver and very economical. One of these refill packs lasts me 2 years and does both houses. Price point is on par with my local stores. I purchased this item full price. I was not compensated in any way for my thoughts. I rely on product reviews just like others to help make my purchase decisions so I try each product very carefully before reviewing and always do my best to leave honest opinions  and provide as much facts as possible based solely on my experience.	1
love these duster, I always buy online.	1
Great	1
I love the Swiffer dusters.  They make dusting a quick chore.	1
Love this product.  Don't care for the new yellow handles.  Would like if they could go back to the blue ones that had which was more sturdier.	1
Delivered on time and excellent product.	1
The duster works very well and is easy to use but the perfume is overwhelming.  I cannot use it.	-1
Tidy on.	1
Works great easy to use multiple uses	1
i buy these my wife doesn't yell about dusting its a win win. On a non joking note these work great with the accessorizes you get with the orgional item while i don't really use them the wife does and tells me to buy more so i guess they work well	1
Good dusters.	1
Good Product.	1
good brand	1
Works as it is supposed to.	1
Great cleaning product!	1
Awesome product, super quick shipping!	1
I love just being able to throw the duster away when I'm done!  The only downside is it can't use it on any rough surfaces as some of the fluff from the material it is made out of will come off of the duster.	1
Great dusters. These are needed in every household. They work great. Don't buy the generic, get the real swiffer brand. These are way cheaper here on Amazon than they are in stores too, so buy them here and have them delivered to your door.	1
Theses smelled great	1
A staple in this household!! Great product!	1
Easy to use and clean up.	1
These dusters are wonderful. I am totally addicted to all the Swiffer products.	1
Great.	1
I love these for quick cleaning!! It's so nice to have them show up on my doorstep! Great value!	1
This is a great product for dusting. Dust clings to the duster and you can just throw it away when it's full of dust. Swiffer makes some good products.	1
My wife can't live without these. They work extremely well. I'm highly allergic and they keep the dust down if used regularly. The long rod tha tilts is great for hard to reach heights. Even my grand daughter likes to pretend and go around dusting things. We let her, but keep her away from the delicate things she might knock off and break. Especially good for cleaning ceiling fan blades. Best thing is they actually collect the dust and microscopic debris rather than just spread it around as a traditional duster does.	1
I love all Swiffer products. They make cleaning 100 times easier and leave everything feeling so much cleaner. This really helps capture alot more dust than any other duster I have used. And I love the scent of febreeze that it leaves behind as you clean. Great product. I personally purchased this product at full price and left a review out of my own accord.	1
Use these every time I dust.  These are great to remove spider webs and general dusting.	1
These are OK - do not like the scent - so will stick to the unscented.	1
I was worried that these would be just like the sweeper clothes (dust often gets left behind) but these definitely pick up the dust well which is fun. The febreeze scent is pretty strong. I used my hands dust and definitely had to wash the scent off after.	1
Works great	1
Excellent product!	1
i'm addicted to these. they pick up every bit of dust. You can easily keep your house dust free using these regularly. It makes dusting so much easier. i have fibromyalgia so these really help me to use my energy wisely.	1
good	1
I love these things.  I live close to several different construction projects and these help me stay on top of the dust.  Thanks.	1
Works well, but doesn't hold as much dirt as they purport. Cleaned my ceiling fan  with a fresh duster and dust was still falling on top of me. I love it for electronics and glass. No streaks and doesn't leave lint like paper towels or dusting rags. I still think it's a great buy. Especially if you hate dusting. Cuts the time in half or better.	1
Dusting made easier...I prefer 360s though, these seem limited after using the Swiffer 360 product	1
Great product	1
dusts well keeping dust on the duster as advertised	1
I love these dusters with the Febreze! They smell so nice and are. Excellent at picking up dust.	1
Easily the greatest single invention since the internal combustion engine.  The Swiffer Duster picks up crud I never even knew was there, holds on to the crud so it doesn't spread, does it in one swipe, can fit into hard to reach places (get the small one and the extension one with the flexible top that can lock in at 30 and 90 degree angles) and your fan blades, horizontal blinds, backs of your TVs, shelves, and tops of your kitchen cabinets, not to mention the top of your refrigerator and baseboards and crown molding will never be cleaner, and lets not forget the tops of your doors, door frames, and pictures. Eliminate allergens from your home and buy at least two boxes.  You may end up needing three if you haven't serious dusted in some time.  Plus, they have a pleasant lemon scent.  I'm hooked on this product and will buy again.	1
This product is always a go-to for cleaning my wood products. I like how it removes waxy build-up and has a fresh scent even though it is extremely soap-heavy scentwise. A little goes a long way if microfiber rags are used as an FYI. My local stores stopped selling this product so I have to buy online even though the price is slightly higher than what I would normally pay. It's worth it because the life of my wood products matters.	1
I have used this for decades.  I have tried other wood cleaners but always come back to Murphy's oil soap.  Does the best job and can be used on a large variety of wood products, from solid maple, cherry, mahogany, pine, and oak furniture, to wall paneling, stained woodwork,  wood floors, to kids wooden toys.  Cleans them all and keeps them looking well conditioned and new.  I have even used a very diluted form to clean food, or sticky items from leather furniture. But I always follow up with a leather conditioner after cleaning.	1
wisk has always been a favorite	1
These are good except for one minor flaw.  Some of the packs are stuck together.  When we tried to pull them apart some of the packs burst.	1
love	1
Cleans great	1
Easy to use.  My husband has allergies and this is the only detergent he can tolerate.	1
This is the only detergent we will use.  The deep clean is just what I need for my HE washer.	1
I really like these Wisk powerblasts.	1
Very good at getting out the stains and very handy to use.	1
good washing pods	1
Good Product	1
Works great on all of my antique woodwork.	1
Does the job	1
We use this product all the time to reduce allergens around our beds.  Quite frankly, it is the only allergen reducing cleaner that works for us.	1
works well	1
I love this stuff- I just used it today- and it smells great!	1
This seems to work ok, but it does leave a little shimmer/oil.  This isn't really an issue unless you have an area with a lot of dust/pollen/etc. that can more easily adhere which might be a problem for those with allergies.  It might also be a curiosity for pets, which I doubt would benefit from an inquisitive lick.	1
Finally came across this one; like the wipes but, seem to go through them too fast while the old bottles had to be mixed: this product line is a nice middle ground, love the signature smell!	1
Love Murpheys! Delivery went fine.	1
Cleans my wood floors in no time.	1
Great product love it	1
This works well, but the scent isn't my favorite.	1
It smells good as an air freshener but Ive never really found that it has actually refreshed my fabrics, only refreshed the air in the room. Its also more expensive than it should be and does not last very long.	-1
use daily on all fabric items in home.	1
I buy multiple bottles of this stuff and use it on my furniture, bedding and carpets. I even spray and let it sit for about 15 minutes before vacuuming (a trick I learned from a friend) and it has done wonders for reducing dust and dander from my cats. I've even convinced family members to buy this Febreze as well! Unlike some other reviewers, I'm a fan of the fact that it leaves no scent so it doesn't compete with any other scent boosters I have in my home. Definitely a must if you deal with allergies or want to improve air quality in your home.	1
I've always been a fan of Febreze and I've also always been an allergy sufferer, so when I found this, I ordered it immediately! Unlike other Febreze products, this one doesn't have a heavily perfumed scent. It doesn't smell bad at all, but has a "clean" scent to it, like a lot of cleaning products. I use this spray on areas that our pets frequent and it really does help. Since it had made such a difference in our living room, I moved to the bedroom and sprayed our duvet and sheets and got the same results. I do like the tropical scented Febreze products, but this allergen reduced formula gives results that I can't ignore. This is now a staple in my house! I would highly recommend this product to others.	1
good	1
TY	1
I am not always able to find the spray at my local store and was pleased to find it through Prime Pantry This is the only cleaner that I have discovered that removes those black spots on my front porch due to spider "droppings" There is a reason this product has been around for more than 100 years...and that is mine!	1
I use this on my hardwood table and the matching chairs. Keeps the dust from settling, cleans off any grime, oils, and splashes from meals. I find that it DOES leave streaks, so I have to dock a star. I spray it on one section at a time and wipe vigorously with a clean paper-towel, but it still kind of streaks, and since the table is right by the window, it is very noticeable. To get rid of the streaking, I do a second cleaning with some Mrs. Meyers All Purpose cleaner. Then my table really shines!	1
I love Murphy's Oil Soap. It has such a fresh, clean smell that lasts a long time. I use it to clean all my wood surfaces, especially my cherry wood kitchen cabinets. It easily cuts through grease and fingerprints that build up around knobs and leaves a nice soft patina on the wood. Great product that I have been using for years and this spray bottle version makes it easier to use,	1
great for spraying on sheets and linens to refresh the room	1
This Febreeze works wonders. https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00QQHZLEQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_26	1
I love this stuff for my down mattress pad and pillows. I use it when I change the sheets.	1
I like it	1
Love Murphy's products	1
I use this on my rugs as well as my curtains to give it a refresh in the winter time	1
Seemed to work, I used it to spray down the dog beds and house, carpet, chairs, couches, doesn't really have a strong scent just smells like clean. We weren't allergic or anything anyway but no one who came had any allergic reactions.	1
Great for price infact excellent item a must for everone.	1
Works great on beds and couches.  some family members are highly allergic to my pets and I spray the couched and have an air purifier on when they come.  They are able to stay a while.	1
Very good.	1
Great product	1
Smells great! My father is allergic to my cats. I spray this on every fabric surface that can't be tossed in the washing machine before he comes over. I feel like it makes a difference calming down the pet allergens in the big fabric items - like my couches.  The house has a nice fresh smell afterwards too.	1
Two boys. Two pairs of not so fresh cleats and football gear. Febreze to the rescue! We have been using a form of febreze for many years. This is a great allergen reducer and room refresher. No more stinky gym socks. Absolutely love this stuff!	1
I have a dog so I keep this by the couch at all times! I alternate between the original febreze, the febreze with gain scent, and this one depending on what I am looking for. The original is the best at getting rid of odors and gives a slightly fresh scent. The febreze with gain smells like clean, fresh laundry. This smells a bit lemon-y, but more chemically. I would say it is definitely more for those with allergies.	1
I normally use the extra-strength Febreze spray to combat dog and teenage odors around the house, and have always been happy with how it works to refresh fabrics and carpet. I tried this variety in just my son's room, because he has seasonal allergies that are worsened by indoor dust and dander. Having used up the whole bottle, I'm not entirely certain it has had a noticeable difference---but hey, anything is worth a try for those who really suffer from allergies!  One star off because it's pretty pricey compare to the bigger bottles of regular Febreze, and also because the scent is so light it's almost not there (this is probably a bonus for people who are sensitive to odors, but I need my fresh smells to linger).	1
Seems to help.  Nice smell temporarily.	1
I honestly don't like the smell of this but if I keep spraying it on the furniture it does make a difference in how much my allergies are an issue for me. I'm allergic to my own cat unfortunately, as well as dust mites. Anything that reduces my exposure is good.	1
This is a must-have in your cleaning supply inventory. If you have any natural wood throughout your home, you need this product! With even a small amount of oil, this product covers a large amount of surface area to provide clean shine. I used this on our wood bed frame, and the bed looked brand new when I was done cleaning it with Murphy's. It only took about ten minutes to clean! This is an easy-to-use product that makes all the difference in your home.	1
Great product for all your wood cleaning needs.	1
Good cleaner, for more than just wood.  I think the spray works better than the regular Oil Soap.	1
This is fine product. I use it to clean all my woodwork and wood furniture. I even use it on two leather chairs I have. It's gentle, smells great, and leaves a nice sheen. I polish my furnishings from time to time but in between this is my go-to cleaner. The pump-spray container is a most convenient feature.	1
It's an OK product. It leaves a little tracks on the wood floor.	-1
Murphys is the best oil for waxing furniture, especially if you have an antiques as I do! It brings out an amazing shine!! Great price and well worth the cost!	1
Wife loves it	1
great!	1
I have bad allergies and this spray helps tremendously - after I get out of bed in the morning I just spray my bed, and later I make up the bed. I have no allergy problems when I sleep.	1
I love Febreze in general and I tried this Allergen Reducer version for the first time to compare to the regular Febreze I use twice a week. With six dogs in our home, Febreze is a must and on more than one occasion, guests have remarked about the fact that our home never smells like dogs. I'm not terribly impressed with the scent of this particular version of Febreze. It smells...off....compared to the traditional stuff. I'm hoping that it does as advertised with regard to reducing the presence of certain allergens in fabric because the bottle is smaller and costs more than the regular Febreze. I think I will probably just go back to the plain or pet Febreze.	1
works well, very helpful in house with cats, seems to get used up very fast, maybe bottle holds less than expected	1
Leaves no scent.	1
I take a trip around the house once a week to eliminate smells that are frequently (and often unfairly) blamed on the dog.	1
I have terrible allergies and this seems to keep the dust down.  I use it once a month or more depending on the weather.  It makes everything seem clean and fresh.	1
Febreeze is my go to. Smells good. Works great. Bottle is a little smaller than I expected but I am still happy	1
I enjoy most Febreeze products...even though I don't find that the scent lasts that long. I mean, I guess that is the purpose of deodorizing - to leave NO scent as opposed to covering it and leaving some other scent. Anyway, as Febreeze it worked fine - good smelling. As an allergen reducer - no idea. I don't have allergies and I clean like a fiend so my dogs' hair isn't around long enough to bother anyone...!	1
i love this product! me and my children are all allergic to dust & dust mites.  So of  course we have asthma. this kills allergens so well.  pillows, blankets, mattress & mattress pads, carpeting. it's a life saver!	1
Nice product, no smell to it, it's unscented, which is good for my highly sensitive girl friend, I've been using Febreeze for years and it does what it promises, it eliminates odors instantly, I use it in my truck and at home	1
Yeah! Love prime!	1
I usually use an allergen reducer that is scentless and then a scented fabric refresher.  I thought this was perfect since it's both in one.  I think it works very well, but the scent could be a lot stronger.  I know a lot of people like a light scent, but I prefer a very strong scent when using a fabric refresher.  The scent isn't the best of the Febreze options either.  I don't really consider it a clean or fresh scent.  Not really sure what it smells like.  If they made the Gain scented Febreze an allergen reducer, I would be all over that one.	1
we use this all the time: doggy odor on carpets.  I vacuum daily but there's just something about two shorthair dogs and ten year old carpet. We get alot of fog too (moisture) and dust (rural). This adds a freshness that I use before company comes over, and also right after I vacuum. I also use it on drapes and curtains.	1
Received this product!.  Thanks!	1
Good	1
Works for me. I have server allergies.	1
Fresh Air	1
ok	1
I search high and low for this dishwasher detergent.  I never have a problem with food left on dishes.  Dishwasher stays clean too.	1
cleans great	1
I use this stuff for extra hard-to-clean pans/dishes about once a month in place of our cheaper regular detergent.  It definitely works better but isn't worth the extra cost for regular use to us.	1
absolutely the cleanest dishes from our dishwasher yet. squeaky clean	1
Good stuff & smells good	1
Used once and I could actually tell a difference!  The price is a bit steep for how small the box is, but I think it works.	1
WHAT. ARM AND HAMMER. WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY.	1
great	1
Smells great! Makes my apartment not smell like the two litter boxes that reside in it.	1
Awesome!  Great product!	1
Good smell. A little bit goes a long way. Made the mistake of using to much and I had to leave the windows open to avoid an allergy attack.	1
Well packaged and as advertised. Thank You	1
Pleased	1
I really hate carpet but the house came with new so instead of replacing (for now) I just vacuum often and use Armor & Hammer products for just about everything in my home.	1
Love this product, not to over powering, use it once a week to keep house smelling good.	1
Really helps keep carpets fresh. I need more.	1
The unnatural chemical smell of the fragrance gave me a headache and ran my dogs out of the house.	-1
Great smell. Makes my carpet and rugs smell fresh. I do love this product.	1
Smells great and easy to use!	1
FAVORITE CLEANING SUPPLY	1
I did some dog sitting as a favor and traces of the dog remained on parts of the carpet. I lightly sprayed some of this odor eliminator and let it sit for a few minutes. When I ran over the sprayed areas with my vacuum I was pleasantly surprised that the odor was no longer detectable. Very nice product.	1
quick freshner while vacuuming ...great for family with dogs	1
This works great and smells good	1
Arrived on time and as expected	1
Magic, takes away some nasty smells.  Used it on a used car my some bought.  Had a really weird odor, now it's totally gone	1
Extra Strength Carpet Odor...	1
Smells great after vacuuming and even after without using it brings a smell from the vacuum left over on next round.	1
Smells good.  Leaves a great clean scent.  The powder easily sucks back up into the vacuum cleaner.	1
I don't really like this stuff. There is no list on the box which states what is used for this product (other than the baking soda obviously) AND when my mother used it downstairs I could smell it quite strongly upstairs and it made my nose and feet itch. I've never had this issue with any other carpet freshener. The smel doesn't last past a day at most. I won't buy this again.	-1
I live with a couple of piss heads. I have saturated my carpets with liquids promising to remove their odor. I avoided powders in fear that they would wreck my vacuum. This stuff is the bomb! It freshens my home instantly and is not overwhelming. It cleans up well and leaves a fresh scent for weeks. And even if I change out my vacuum cleaner bag, my vacuum smells pretty! I like this scent and the one specifically for pet odors.	1
Wooooooooo. I looove the smell of this. When I'm vacuuming my room, I don't even need aerosol afterwards. Just don't sprinkle too much in one area.	1
Good product.  Does the job and smells really good, too.	1
smells good.  not much in the box so it really will only be enough to vacuum all your carpets once.	1
Always a great product.	1
It's Arm and Hammer, what can you say!  Been keeping our house smelling fresh for years!	1
Good product for quick clean up. Only wish it was a larger box. Nice clean smel	1
Love to have that smell of clean in the air when you clean the whole house.  Wish it lasted longer, but it does seem to really help with the dog smell.	1
Fast delivery and priced right. Good product.	1
no issues	1
Works good.	1
Great deodorizer for those of you with pets like me. All you have to do is sprinkle the carpet deodorizer around your entire carpeted area, let it sit for a few minutes and then vacuum like you normally would. It helps draw out the oily smells from dogs and makes your place smell better.	1
I love this product but if you add it to your pantry box expect EVERYTHING to be covered in powder if it gets the smallest bit of damage :( hoping it hasn't ruined anything.  Amazon did give me an instant refund on the damaged box. I love Amazon.  I usually get it at my local grocery store. It works very very well! Its got an intense smell, a good smell just very strong, so a little goes a very long wat. Shake carefully!  Smoker odors, pet odors... Everything! Its great.	1
This has such a wonderful smell and leaves my home smelling so clean.  I am not convinced that it helps lift dirt from the carpet, but it sure smells good.	1
Great price	1
Didn't do anything for my carpet.	-1
Great product	1
like this.	1
This powder makes my whole apartment smell heavenly and I have two cats..I found it not necessary to sprinkle it every time I run the sweeper..It Still leaves off a pleasant scent after a couple of sweepings !	1
smells good	1
Great stuff.  Makes the whole house smell wonderful.  Use sparingly, a little goes a long way.	1
Clumpy on the carpet, but nice smell	1
This is always wonderful on carpets.	1
Go lightly with this, it's easy to use too much. Sprinkle lightly, let it sit, then vacuum it up. If you use too much the scent is over powering, go lightly and it makes your home smell a bit cleaner and fresh. One box should last two or three vacuums, unless you want a stronger scent. Start with less and go with more if you think you need it.  I'm not sure how the voodoo magics work, but this stuff somehow makes more dirt, dust, and pet fur hairs come out of my carpets. I've vacuumed the house, used this, then vacuumed again and more stuff came out.  If you go lightly, even in a large house, the scent is kind of nice. If you use the whole box it's going to be pretty bad and overpowering. Bear in mind that even after you vacuum it up the scent will still be blowing out of your vacuum until you put in a new bag. My house is pretty big and I use about half a box at a time, gets things clean and fresh but I don't have to open the windows after	1
Well it's certainly get the stink out of the rug as I was hoping, thanks ex roommate who never washed, but I almost choked on the fumes well vacuuming, as the room had poor ventilation. My house still stinks of it, but given how it smelled before I'm not complaining.	1
Great product, fast shipping, good price. Would buy from again.	1
I love this stuff. We have three kids all under age 6 and you would not believe how many times a week we vacuum our floors (at least once a day). However, once week we apply this product to our floors throughout our entire house and let it sit for a little while. When we vacuum this stuff off of the carpet, I immediately will see our Hyla water turning brown. This shouldn't happen since we arr constantly running the vacuum but every week this always surprises me. This stuff gets the dirt and grime from deep within your carpet and will make your house smell amazing as well. Just be forewarned, start out with a small amount. I put my husband in charge of applying this and vacuuming one week and he used and entire box in our living room. It was a very strong smell and I was glad my youngest wasn't home at the time because I bet it would have caused her to have an asthma attack. That was user error and if you read the instructions and follow their instructions you shouldn't run in to any issues.	1
Fresh smelling and stays that way for quite a few days, had purchased this in the store before so I knew it was a good product.  I have 3 cats so this certainly helps my carpet and apartment smell better!	1
LOVE this stuff!  Takes care of those nasty pet odors in my carpet.	1
I liked it, but the aroma was a bit too strong for me, I think I'd like to cut the stuff in half with pure baking soda. But not sure if I'm going to bother, I just use it very sparingly so I'm not overwhelmed with the smell. It's not too bad but I'm sensitive to smells and they often bother me when they don't effect others. It's really good though and lasts a good bit of time, so I'm giving it a high rating, I'd probably like to find a more subtle smell, like a linen aroma or something like that.	1
Works well.	1
LOVE IT as I have dogs and it does its purpose	1
I use boxes of this stuff, smells SOOO good and really helps to pick up dirt. I sprinkle it on and let it sit for 30 mins to a day or so!	1
Has a wonderful fragrance. Unfortunately it didn't last too long.  I still like it and will use it each time I vacuum.	1
Like it.  Leaves fresh smell.	1
good stuff	1
Works as described	1
Use it because I have big dogs..	1
smells great	1
kills the odors! love it	1
Definitely helps clean the carpet.	1
Does a very good job on carpet odors and is easy to vacuum up. It doesn't have a strong, overpowering fragrance. Also nice for automobile carpets.	1
perfect for pets very clean smell and easy to vacum up	1
House smells fresh!	1
Great product and arrived in good condition.	1
I love this stuff. I sprinkle the hole house and vacuum up the freshness. It makes the carpet smell like clean laundry and seems to make them look a little cleaner too. I really wish this particular smell was still readily available but it's not they have a ton of ocean breeze and that smell while good it isn't this smell	1
ok	1
Works well	1
Good product!	1
Yes!!  Away with the stinkin pet odor. Love it.  My whole house smells fresh. One use worked for about a week,  maybe a little more.  Which is great for someone who usually has to vacuum everyday to keep down the big dog and mechanic husband smell.  Bought 3 this last time.  Also has many other uses like GARBAGE DISPOSAL!	1
Thanks	1
Good	1
Smells so heavenly. Fine powder. Vacuums up very easily. So it doesn't look like someone spilled flour on your rug after you vacuum.  Smell does last a quite a bit longer than I expected it too.  Made the room smell so great. Cheap price. It was the perfect purchase. Will be buying more.	1
Very strong scent, which depending on who you are could be a good thing or a bad thing. I have a husband, a kid, and 3 dogs so the strong scent is great for me. Though I only do this once or twice a week because the scent is so strong. It is a pleasant floral scent. I really like it and it helps keep my house smelling fresh.	1
works well	1
Great item for dorm rooms where men's sporting equipment odor is lingering	1
Our carpet is on it's last legs....or whatever carpet has.  We clean it regularly but it's past that...it needs replacing.  Sadly, it took the idea of having company over that made us buy this. We were desperate for a fresher scent than walking in and smelling stale air.  I used this all over, and then vacuumed. Then went back to some spots that seem to hold odor and brushed this in with the broom, let it sit, and then vacuumed again.  Today I came home and noticed walking in that the house smelled good.  For once!	1
Really like it...	1
good	1
great product smells good	1
works good but a bit of white dust left	1
GREAT for pet owners.  I use it for my carpets and litter box, too!	1
This smells Amazing! My Boys now love to clean and vacuum the living room. Smells AMAZING!! This is so much better than any other product. Everything came on time. Seller did a good job of packaging. Will buy again when i run out	1
Love the smell	1
Great	1
Love this scent! Works great and seems to have many uses in each box.	1
Great at neutralizing those oh so tough summer carpet odors.	1
This smells awesome!!  I have 2 cats and 1 dog. Sometimes pet odor can be a bit much. I use this before vacuuming and this makes the house smell great	1
does good job of eliminating odors	1
I have a dog who I have had since I was a puppy, unfortunately she peed on my brand new carpet when she was a puppy and even after shampooing I could smell it!  I bought this stuff and use it constantly (probably more then necessary lol) anyway the smell has completely disappeared! The air smells so much cleaner when using this stuff I love it! Even had our pizza man come to our door and compliment how it smelled in my place lol.  I continue to buy this stuff constantly... wish I could get it in bulk! (maybe I can , havnt looked)	1
This makes your house smell wonderful after each vacuum. No Moisture smell anymore in this weather. I used a little and it did the job. One packet will last many weeks. Great buy!	1
This smells so good!  I have hardwood floors throughout my house and have a few area rugs.  I like to use this for those rugs to freshen them up.  I have cats so the rugs are definitely not the freshest all of the time.  This is perfect and such a great price for how much you get.	1
i love the way it makes my carpet smell	1
This powder smells so good and makes the house smell wonderful.  I shook a little on my living room carpet and it was really easy to vacuum and smells lovely.	1
love the scent  will re-purchase	1
Got this in the nick of time.  My dog decided to go on the carpet the next day!	1
good	1
pleased with them	1
they must be great... my dd takes them daily in her lunch!	1
Tastes like what I imagine bird food would taste like.	-1
tasty	1
My favorite snack to eat on break at work!	1
Wow. These were hands down some of the best (if not the best) snack bars I've ever had. I would definitely buy this flavor again. They were just the right size and tasted amazing.	1
Good and great price.	1
These taste soooo good, and they're gluten free!!	1
We purchased these when they were less than $2/box... we needed granola bars whose ingredients were listed in plain english, and we needed them to be delivered to our home in our AmazonFresh order. The affordable cost really did help, and we ended up buying 4 boxes.  I must say, I went into these bars expecting either a chewy Kind bar (similar to their normal bars), or a crumbly nightmare that is similar to Nature Valley granola bars.... but I was proven wrong, and I'm happy I was. These bars somehow blended chewy and crunchy together. They don't flake all over your clothes, and an added benefit is that they aren't too sweet. I did notice that the blueberry was not dried blueberries, but was actually a little gelatinous cube of blueberry, almost like a jam that has too much pectin. The syrup they use to hold the bar together is just the right amount of sticky. I especially loved the tiny amaranth or quinoa-type bits that were mixed in. These bars have 140 Calories each, but don't let the low Calorie count fool you; they are extremely filling when consumed with a beverage of some kind.  If you're looking for someone the whole family can enjoy, that is made out of real food (ingredients you can understand), and is just so darn tasty, get these!	1
Good on the go snack	1
Good snack or breakfast.	1
they are very good	1
good for energy but not real high in protein	1
Have fallen in love with these bars. A filling snack and easy to take with you. The candy bar shape with chocolate are excellent but all have almonds which are rock hard and I can't eat.	1
very good fiber	1
They are ok for a granola bar. There is a lot going on in 1 bar. They are many different flavors. They are to hard for my liking, I like a more chewy granola. They are super messy. When you eat them they feel like you are eating pop rocks. They do however fill you up and keep you satisfied for awhile.	1
great for kids b/c healthy, non gmo etc. but kids love.  A+	1
Delicious and Healthy!	1
great taste and I prefer this type of Kind bar. Packed with a lot of good ingredients and gluten free. Great grab and go snack	1
Item as expected.	1
Yumm!	1
EXCELENTE, GRACIAS	1
These granola bars are great.  They are big and very delicious.  My husband even likes them so I send them to work with him so he doesn't come home complaining that he didn't eat all day.....well, actually, he still complains but at least now I know now it isn't true.  :)	1
KIND Granola bars are always a hit with my husband and me and we really did enjoy the unique blueberry vanilla granola bars.  Will purchase again in the future.	1
Showed up all crushed... just expensive oatmeal with a trendy package. Buy a big container of oatmeal and add raisins or yogurt and save your money.	-1
Just trendy, overpriced oatmeal and molasses bars. Get the cheap ones from the store. Same stuff without the BS marketing.	-1
Bland rice Krispy tasting bar.	-1
Might as well eat half a gram cracker.	-1
They are very nasty. I love coconut, but the taste was off on these. I would not purchase again.	-1
not a fan	-1
Plate is large enough, but not strong enough or thick enough for hot, casserole style service.	-1
Horrible product! Doesn't do more than a wet sponge would. Except when you use this thing the sponge gets dirty so quickly and falls apart into pieces. You find yourself having to clean up the pieces of the eraser that fall off during cleaning after using these. The feeling of scrubbing with this thing is grotesque, feeling like you're scratching a blackboard. Miserable experience with these things. Yuck	-1
I have to admit that I didn't read any review for this item, but I believed that a sponge is a sponge, wrong! This one will melt in your hands and disappear in annoying crumbs, I'm not sure for what they are ment, bit I can't find any use for something of such low quality!!!	-1
I'm torn, I love OT because it smells so good, but it doesn't clean well....at all. Every surface I use iron leaves visible streaks and feels slightly sticky. I have to go back over over it with bleach or vinegar to get rid of the residue. Makes it pointless.... but because it smells so good I haven't given up on it yet. I still use what I have but I definitely won't buy it again. Going back to Method.	-1
smells like old lady - scent fades fast	-1
it doesn't smell for that long,  only a minute or so.	-1
BEWARE! Febreze is TOXIC to lungs! Febreze gave me a lung/upper respiratory infection and a bad cough for 2 weeks, and I'm still not well. I've been coughing constantly and hacking up green phlegm every few minutes. One of the sickest periods I've been in, in my life. I have no other symptoms of cold or flu, just a bad cough and green mucus, and it won't go away after 2 weeks. It happened immediately (within 24 hours) of spraying Febreze in my bedroom and house. It started with a bad multi-hour migraine (one of the worst ever), and then weeks of coughing. I'm a normally very healthy and strong young adult.  Hard to say if it worked as far as odors. I'm too I'll to smell now!	-1
Febreze is over-rated, over-scented, and over-priced.	-1
The blue liquid runs down toilet lid and leaves stains.  It doesn't remove stubborn stains.	-1
Haven't used them yet, didn't notice it did not come with the wand	-1
Convenient, but doesn't clean as good as I would like!	-1
Love this cereal, but only when it is intact. The box was smashed in shipping. Actually got a piles of individual shreds. Had to throw the entire box in the trash.	-1
smashed in box	-1
Ouch! Do yourself a favor - - buy 3 ply Kleenex ultra soft. Your nose will thank you.	-1
Technology has so improved that Kleenex is cutting their layers too thin. As a result Kleenex that was once strong and resilient is not anymore. When I blow it scatters dust and debris all over my chest. But the price still rises. I hope someone who cares about their customers comes along and gives us the quality we used to get from Kleenex.	-1
Seemed to be a little stale,but sounded good.	-1
I love the idea of the cinnamon and pecan combination and I like Special K cereal. I was not really fond of the taste after my first bowl. The flakes were the usual super crisp and the cinnamon is a nice touch but there's a bitterness from the pecans that was overpowering for me. I didn't care for it.	-1
Ick. This is some of the nastiest cereal I have ever tasted. I will not be buying it again. The taste was off and the texture was awful. The pecans are super hard and the cereal gets soggy quick. Don't waste your money.	-1
The scent is too strong.	-1
Taste wasn't the best. I felt like there was a hint of mint in there.	-1
These were the most anemic tasting "brownies" I have ever tasted.  I still have most of them.	-1
Not a big fan of processed fiber bars	-1
I was extremely disappointed.  It's a bit like eating cheap chocolate flavored, clay brownies with a good dose of chalk mixed in.  I've made high fiber brownies that tasted at least like brownies.  I ate one, called my sister and asked if she liked them.  She said yes so she's getting the rest and saving me from wasting all that money when I throw them out.  It's the old "Let's get Mikey."	-1
These bars are tasty but include high maltose corn syrup - listed as their second ingredient. If I'd know that, wouldn't have eaten them. There are healthier bars out there like Kashi bars with almonds and dark chocolate and NO corn syrup. Would skip these until the company omits the corn syrup.  Ingredients Whole Grain Oats, High Maltose Corn Syrup, Raisins, Almonds, Roasted Peanuts, Sugar, Rice Flour, Chicory Root Extract, Fructose, Cranberries, Canola Oil, Maltodextrin, Vegetable Glycerin, Soy Lecithin, Salt, Barley Malt Extract, Baking Soda, Natural Flavor, Mixed Tocopherols Added to Retain Freshness.	-1
These have too much sugar. The reason they are ninety calories is that they are small.	-1
Gift?	-1
Gift?	-1
Great  healthy snack for chocolate Lubbers	-1
I gave it a one star.  I wouldn't order it again.  The taste of caramel definitely was disguised.  Wondered if they put cardboard in it to hold it together.  Not what I expected.  Don't believe the picture.  Hard to find caramel & looks nothing like the picture.  Wonder what candy bar they actually took a picture of.  Glad I only bought one box.	-1
ok	-1
Terrible -- its like they don't know how to pack a tissue box.  All the tissues were coming out in pieces and chunks	-1
the photo is false advertising.  there is no caramel like that anywhere in this bar.  i expected it to be similar to a 'snickers' but it's dry and not even slightly like the photo.  someone should go after them for false advertising.	-1
edible but not tasty	-1
palm oil in it.. gave it away	-1
This is the plainest, yuckiest cereal I've ever tried. Like soft cardboard. It's a NO from me, sorry.	-1
Just okay....too sweet and I gave my box away.	-1
I haven't eaten these in years but I don't remember them being so sweet and I don't like sweet cereal. Though in all fairness they are not anywhere as sweet as most sweetened cereal.	-1
Box arrived damaged.  Top was dented in and bottom was crushed.  Box would not even stand on the shelf.  Plastic bag had a hole and the cereal was stale.  Would not purchase as home delivery again.	-1
Did not order.	-1
Ehhhh these are dry and lack on flavor.	-1
Do not taste as good as the brownies.	-1
These bars are very hard on texture.  Even my 5 yr.older said they are too hard.  I wanted soft bars.  These can break your teeth.	-1
Very sticky.  Wouldn't recommend shipping during summer hot months.  Not as good as same item purchased in local store.	-1
not what is advertised different cereal.	-1
Both boxes I purchased tasted old/stale	-1
Gift?	-1
Box broke open	-1
Smashed and opened!!!!	-1
too sweet	-1
These were definitely not my 'cup of tea' per se. I am sure they would appeal to most people but I just did not like the taste. They were nice and fresh though and crunchy like you would expect CHEX to be.	-1
Most of Stacy's chips are tasty but I would rather eat cardboard than these chips.	-1
The bag was open and chips everywhere in the box!	-1
they were crispy and all, but the flavor wasn't to my liking	-1
Buying these products like this was stupid of me.  Just waiting a week and my local grocery store would have some of them in regular size on sale.  With the chips, there would be 2 or 3 regular size ones and a lot of little pieces in the tiny bags.  This is a waste of money and resources and I regret having bought them.	-1
would never buy it again on the internet as it came a a glob of nibbles and could not use it for hummus as desired.... ps:  the garbage left tasted great....don't buy this if it has to be shipped!	-1
Didn't taste so great.  Most of the chips were broken. I thought the way they package everything else this would have been better.	-1
Bland flavor. Seasonings weak. Way overpriced for essentially baked bread chips. When pulverized, they make great bird feed. I'll stick to seasoned tortilla chips.	-1
Good flavor, really generous bag, but the pita itself was not what I expected.  I think this is not a measure of quality, but personal taste.  So I would not re-purchase, but I would certainly go back to the brand itself again.	-1
Im very disappointed in this pita chips. I wish I would've never tasted it because It was one of the worse experiences I ever had with food. Im not sure how it got so many good reviews but everyone has different taste what taste good to some people might not taste good to others. This bag wasn't big either in my opinion its very small to be party size compared to other brand of chips. I was only able to take a bite out of one chip and ended up throwing the rest away.  I didn't taste the garlic or parmesan or any flavor it claims to have. THERE IS NO TASTE!  Also the texture of this chip is very and I mean VERY HARD. I had a hard time chewing it that's how hard it is. Its annoying because normally I don't buy brands of chips I never had before but looking for stuff on amazon is a hassle, time consuming and ANNOYING. I  didn't see all the other choices until after I placed my order and it was too late. I really think amazon needs to do better with setting up the pantry to make it easier to buy and find items. Bottom line is I will NOT buy this brand EVER again, they are so hard to eat im going to throw the rest of the bag in the trash. They have nerves to sell these chips at 5 dollars, Im not sure how much I paid but this is definitely not worth 5 dollars. They made the bag look fancy and expensive but the taste and quality is POOR.	-1
Fairly tasty in small amounts but after eating a full serving on two separate meals I became plagued with tummy troubles. They also Have an odd plaster like aftertaste for me unfortunately as well somehow? I'm usually a big fan of Stacey's and have no issues with pita breads but this batch or seasoning isn't worth the heart burn.	-1
good trace, beware they were crushed at the bottom of the box it came in	-1
Although inside the 'sell by' date, I found these to be very stale.  Would not recommend this item for the Prime Pantry purchase.	-1
Way too sweet and fake sugary flavor	-1
Bag falls in the can all the time!	-1
These are one long string of bags that need to be torn appart to separate from each other. Some times they tear on the perforations and sometimes they just tear. If you successfully get one separated, you will need to find a way to get it open. Ether a pair of grippy gloves or damp fingers will be required. Again, you may irreparably tear the bag. If so, start over and if your successful this time you can use this second (or third) bag to throw away the now useless, torn bag. Huge waist of my time. My 8 yo is incapable of accomplishing this task, thereby putting more work on my plate. I do like the tie flaps if the bag survives being put in the trash can, it ties nice. Just be careful not to tear it tying it . Glad makes a much better tie flap bags (in a box) that doesn't require separation on a perforation. Don't get these, they're a pain in the @$$.	-1
When I got these I realized right away they are not the same kind of kitchen bags I buy at the store. They don't appear to stretch in any way, and I will hesitate to use them for any kind of real, messy garbage.	-1
Bags are perforated at the bottoms, and then at the flap tie alternatively. When you need to tear one off at the flap tie, you might as well get a pair of scissors and cut it, they are so hard to pull apart. And the bag material itself is like old shopping bags that are about to fall apart. Cheap roll of bags, but don't over stuff them.	-1
I've ripped more bags trying to access a new one.  It's easy to do.  it's just a roll, no box.  When you pull out a bag it's connected to the one behind so you need to rip it off.  Sometimes the rip is clean, sometimes it initiates a rip down the side rendering the bag unusable.	-1
This is probably the worst review I have ever given on any item.  These trash bags are difficult to separate from one another and are not strong enough to hold but very little weight.  They can be filled about half full of soft items with no sharp corners and very light weight.  Then if handled very carefully might hold together long enough to get them into the trash receptacle.  These were a penny cheaper than my usual kitchen bags so I was keen on saving money.  Hah!  Many bags ended up in the trash themselves when they tore to pieces.  Others were double bagged to manage to be usable.  I will not buy what turned out to be very expensive bags again.	-1
no flavor	-1
Crumbled upon arrival	-1
Crunch up :( broken up!	-1
This flavor is really bad. I'm sorry but this not one of my strongest flavor or a go to flavor. Some may prefer it but it's not for me.	-1
Old and soft; completely bad.  I tossed in the trash.  So far, not impressed with the quality of the items from Prime Pantry.	-1
Tastes artificial	-1
Ewwww not tasty! I love lemon desserts, but this was a fail. Stick to the regular or birthday cake oreos.	-1
ok	-1
I like lemon cookies, and was excited to try the Oreo Lemon Creme Sandwich cookies. I was disappointed though. I felt there was too much creme, and not enough of the lemon flavor. I think I would enjoy these in a thin version though.  Although I frequently do reviews on products offered to me at a promotional price, this was a personal purchase. I paid full price. I was not asked, nor am I obligated to give a review.	-1
crumbled broken up	-1
All the cookies were crunch up.	-1
These are not the same quality as those purchased in a super market. They are thin versions and crumbled easily.  Would not recommend or purchase again.	-1
MAKE THEM IN THE USA YOU ......	-1
Cookies were broken, 95% of them	-1
Every cookie was broken.	-1
These cookies were stale and bag had a slight tear in it.	-1
Too sweet. Not to my taste.	-1
I had high hopes for these. I wanted them to be good. Being that I love food. I took out one cookie, dunked it in milk and then almost threw up. Thanking about them still makes me sick.	-1
if the kids don't like it....	-1
Not my favorite Oreo cookie taste...just stick to the regular.	-1
These really didn't taste like birthday cake to me.  Not a fan and won't purchase again.  Original oreos taste better for an occasional treat.	-1
These taste very fake and kind of remind me of some preteen flavored lip balm. They leave an awful aftertaste also.	-1
Works horrible. Your better off buying the spray bottle versus these as these streak big time. Totally worthless. Save your $ and get the spray.	-1
did not work as well as traditional windex and a paper towel.	-1
A toy best is to buy a commercial grade one at your local restaurant supple place..	-1
These didn't do anything to keep my toilet clean, and the smell was very industrial.  They smelled like the cleaner that would be used in a rest area bathroom.  I will not buy these again as they serve no purpose.	-1
Leaves white residue from the fabric, not the liquid.	-1
It leaves streaks on screens.  But does well on keyboards.	-1
don't last	-1
scent is right per description, easy to open and use, but goo inside stays gooey about one day, then skins over and to catch the linen scent you have to hold it near your nose; tried it near an air filter with low fan thinking to spread the scent and skin got tougher, aroma faded even more	-1
These are a huge disappointment because, while they seem to clean, they leave so many streaks and puddles that won't come off, no matter how fast I try nor what other product for screens I use .  Leaves screens worse than they were	-1
Only lasts a few DAYS.	-1
Hardly last. Smell very nice. Need several in 1 room to make it work.	-1
Did not work for us.  The sprays are much more successful at elimenating odor.	-1
I  found out synthesis products can be too agressive for the respiratory system.  The smell is really strong and not that pleasant; it gives headache, not good for me. I won't buy another even at a very low price.	-1
Smells nice but the top won't stay up, which prevents the scent from getting out.  I had to tape it open.	-1
Works if you stay within 12" of it.	-1
Using in a small bathroom and can't really smell it!?	-1
Dang things won't stay open unless you pull them out to their maximum level, which make them last less. Don't understand why would you do this Glade?	-1
Plastic fell apart cheaply made	-1
Must be the lack of humidity out west, but it disappeared too quickly. The scent wasn't what I expected linen to be either.	-1
Would not buy this scent again.  Not powerful enough	-1
its sitting next to my chair, and i cant smell it at all, ever.	-1
Made no difference. Faded quickly - had no *reach* in the room	-1
unfortunately these leave behind a lot of lint.	-1
These suck. They don't smell unless you stick your nose right up to them.	-1
No smell after you open it.	-1
Gel like in consistency, when the container is opened the material dries out within a few days. I do live in an area with low humidity but other brands lasted longer. And, although I do not want anything too heavily scented, this product is too lightly fragranced although I do like this particular variety which has a clean, rather than perfume scent. It seemed like a good addition to my prime pantry box.  The lid twists open but refuses to stay in place, it slips back down to the base. So to prop it open I cut a wooden kitchen skewer into a short length and poked it into the gel extending out a 1/4 inch or so which prevents the lid from closing. This is a problem I never encountered with any other solid air freshener. So, between the short-life of the gel, weak fragrance and the inability of the container to stay open, I am not impressed.	-1
Junk .... doesn't even taste goo	-1
Came crunch up! Too salty	-1
got my box today and not one single can is not pure crumbs. very sad about this	-1
I ordered this but only received one small can and not a pack of 12 small cans. I didn't see any way to respond to Prime Pantry purchases. The one can was as expected...	-1
Love pringles .BUT most every can was busted up in little pieces. Roughly handled in shipping i guess	-1
This product review is for Pringles Original Small Stacks, 1.3 Ounce (Pack of 12)  These really came pretty beat up, most of them where broken, you could basically pour the chips right in your mouth.  This was easy to make and it turned out great. My family really enjoyed this product and we will be using it again in the future.  This was the first time I had ever considered using online shopping for any of my food. Amazon Grocery had a pretty good selection of dry supply items. Everything that I ordered came nicely packed and wasn't damaged at all. These items where very easy to make and they all tasted great. When I made this purchase I had a coupon for $25 of on an order of $75 or more. It was really nice that Amazon kept track of how many items you had in your box and how much space was left. Each item also showed how much space it would take up in the box, so you had an idea of what else might fit in the box. After I had the box completely filled I simply checked out as usual and a few days later it showed up at my house  Overall these items where great and I will be ordering again in the future. What a great way to get your shopping done with out leaving the comfort of your own home.	-1
The product was STALE!!	-1
Good taste but they are crushed badly.  I don't mind if they would be broken into a couple pieces.  But they arrive in crumbles, smashed up.  Outside box looked intact.  So it must be from repeated throwing of the packages around, not sure.	-1
Update: I took a closer look at the individually sealed packages and they are not sales all the way. I noticed the seal on the bag was crimped funny and so I lifted the flap and there was a whole. They were all affected.  I have purchased these before in the grocery store and loved them. They make a quick snack or easy breakfast. Normally they are crisp and waifer like, but this box that I ordered in my pantry pack is not. It is like they are stale. Similar to graham crackers that have been open for 2 weeks when your kids forget to close the box. These are either really old or were subjected to extreme temperatures in a warehouse or something. While box will be thrown away.	-1
The expiration was only three days away once delivered. The food product was dry and actually hard. We couldn't eat this and it wasn't allowed to be returned. This actually happened to MOST of the food items in my order. What a waste of money. It all went into the trash. So upset about this. I will never order food from online again.	-1
It's a very hard cookie. A person has to dunk it to make it soft.	-1
There were to many broke ones, won't buy like this again, I will get from store.	-1
cheap oily taste,  I guess I will go back to homemade.  this is garbage	-1
dry and chalky. won't buy again	-1
unfortunately the cookies arrived stail.	-1
My family didn't enjoy these. The flavor was lacking. I had high hopes for these too.	-1
Do not care for these	-1
Hello and good day I just wanted to tell you about this item . These came crushed and broken along with melted . I tried to reach this seller but to no use . So I would by these with care. They are at a great price point but at what costs .	-1
You came here thinking you were going to see rave reviews about how Nabisco cracked the atom in making a new and "exciting" cookie flavor, wrong. These are hunks of brown play dough disks with bits of yellow play dough placed over the surface of the "cookies". I put the word cookie in quotes because it appears someone at Nabisco made these things so soft they are more like nasty peanut butter cup than a cookie. What went wrong?  I think the problem is that they chocolate is misrepresented in this equation. The only reason people buy jars of Reeces Peanut Butter is because they are mentally unstable. These cookies taste sickly of the peanut butter with nothing to stop you from revealing the dirty secret behind it. The "Peanut Butter" they use could hardly be called a peanut butter. Sometimes I like to think I am trying something because I think it might be a good idea but I secretly knew they couldn't replicate the formula for cups into a cookie. Something about not having the chocolate to lean on leaves the nasty peanut butter exposed to the world.  This product is disgusting and the peasants who enjoy it would shove virtually any sweet into their mouths to sate their constant hunger for Type 2.	-1
I hate to say this, but I did not like these cookies at all. Sadly, I usually love Chips Ahoy, but not this flavor.	-1
The peanut butter pieces in these cookies are the only good things about them.  The cookies have the texture of playdoh. No discernible chocolate flavor.  Also, there's way more packaging material than needed. This gives the impression you're getting more product than you actually are, which isn't a bad thing since they're awful.	-1
First the cookies are so small they don't even FIT in the compartments designed to hold them secure for shipment. Mine arrived with one whole section of cookies OUT of their tray and  spread over the top of the other two trays. I'm really getting sick of companies keeping the same size packaging when their product has decreased in size, unless my batch was defective this is what appears to be going on here. the cookies are tiny and do not fit in their compartments, they have alot of space all around them. everytime a company downsizes it's weight or product size, I stop buying that product. Do they think we are stupid and don't notice or are they hoping we don't notice? Whichever it is, I'm discgusted by it. Try to find a pound of coffee or 8 oz of yogurt, or 64oz of orange juice. i gave 2 stars because they're chocolate the only good thing about them is the chocolate and reeses.	-1
These weren't as good as I thought they would be.	-1
there ok not really tasting like reese's more like rubber and sugar not for me won't buy again	-1
We usually like chips ahoy cookies of all kinds, but these were not even kinda of good. There was too much candy and chips for the amount of dough.  Maybe they will be just the right thing for you, hop so.	-1
Totally unimpressed would not waste my money again not enough flavor just not tasty to me	-1
I know they are cookies and supposed to be sweet, but these things are disgustingly sweet. The soft texture is off-putting as well.	-1
I was truly disappointed in them. I expected them to have a definitive PB Cup taste and they did not. They just tasted like regular Chips Ahoy soft cookies that VERY rarely had a slightly peanut butter flavor.	-1
These arrived crushed and only two whole cookies  were In the package.	-1
I think its this brand that tastes horrible. I suggest looking at something else	-1
I have discovered that I am not a fan of toasted chip crackers... I just don't think they are very good.	-1
these were halfway ground up before I got them, CRUSHED	-1
The chips themselves are delicious, but ordering them from Amazon is a terrible idea. Half of the bag consisted of crumbs and broken pieces. Might have made a good coating for meat, I guess.	-1
Incredibly salty and strangely "burnt" taste.  Will not purchase again.	-1
I liked these better than the sea salt flavor, but overall I still do not like these- they don't carry the same taste as regular wheat thins	-1
Arrived smashed	-1
A gift	-1
Came crushed	-1
Too dry. As if this product had expired. No one liked this snack at church.	-1
tastes awfull	-1
I have tried these from a local store this winter and they were delicious, but this particular box that I just received was stale and flavorless. Interestingly, the box and inner bag were sealed. Maybe I received a 'bad' box?	-1
Also crunched!!!	-1
Delivered in pieces.	-1
First time I ever complained about these crackers, I love THEM!  But they were packed with heavy items and arrived CRUSHED.  Please ask shipping to be careful about boxing correctly.	-1
A gift	-1
Package COMPLETELY SMASHED! No whole cracker found ! ! !	-1
Box to small gone in ten minuets	-1
Just a hint of ranch taste. Wheat thins are already kinda sweet so the added ranch flavor just kinda threw the whole thing off for me. The Buffalo ones are amazing though!!!	-1
Much too salty for my taste.  Would not buy again.	-1
The box was crushed in shipment.  Will make good crumbs to cook with, but not a crack for a snack.	-1
We ate them but preger flavor of regular Ritz	-1
These were given to me, and I am  used to eating the regular awesome Ritz crackers, so these taste horrid	-1
Nothing special and way too expensive,	-1
Not much flavor.	-1
ok	-1
This peanut butter was served as a last meal to those being executed in the gulags in Soviet Russia. This peanut butter was also used by the Khmer Rouge to really make people feel as though there is no way out of the work camps. A food crate was busted open in Kenya during one of the last famine periods only to remain untouched as people would rather starve that ingest this foul substance. This Jif Natural Peanut Butter Spread and Honey, 16 oz should be tried in Nuremberg because its taste is a war crime.  Something about the sickly sweet taste makes it unsuitable for toasted bread. This Peanut Butter spread also makes bad bedfellows with jelly due to its foul taste blocking out all enjoyment that the jelly might have provided. I must believe that those who bought this product with the Smuckers squeeze bottle jelly are so tweaked out on methamphetamine that the taste buds are failing them. One suggestion I missed with this product was to try it on a vegetable; I couldn't bear the thought of having a farmer work so hard on growing celery only to see it ravaged by this terrible product.  Would not eat this product again unless being force fed in a Seven style force feeding.	-1
This has 2 types of sugar. Not in any way a healthy breakfast cereal.	-1
Ancient Grains, with illustrations of the lovely grains, but NO mention of SUGAR being a main ingredient. I was so disappointed to see the shiny little cheerios, clearly covered with sugar.  I wish the regular, more healthy Cheerios came in a smaller size, suitable for one person.	-1
not very tasty; oatmeal tends to clump at the bottom of the bowl	-1
Did not taste good at all.  Like bittersweet cardboard.  I could not even finish one bar.	-1
i don't like the taste of these.  Not what i expected.  I won't be finishing the box.  Opportunity lost for a good product.	-1
expensive and ok tasting, not buying again	-1
Not as great tasting as i had hoped. Its really got a strong salty bite to it and i really wanted that amazing sweet and salty combination you would get with most combinations of chocolate and sea salt. This just didn't do it for me.	-1
Too sweet.	-1
As I type this I am eating a Kashi peanut butter chewy granola bar. It is dry. It doesn't have much flavor. It is better than the Chocolate Almond and Sea Salt bars by a mile. I tried really hard to like these because I had six of them to eat. They have little flavor, they have a dry texture, and what you see on the package is a lot like my dating profile picture: it is a much nicer version of what you will see in person. The only saving grace of this bar is that it is fairly health in the whole scheme of things, at least when compared to candy bars, and you aren't likely to eat too much because of the taste so it has built in calorie control!	-1
not enough chocolate to balance the salt. could barely tell there were almonds in these. I think the savory-styles of KIND bars are better.	-1
These should be good, but strangely aren't. They are bland, neither salty nor chocolate. They are dry not chewy, and disappointing.	-1
Gross.	-1
Not the best Kashi bar compared to others. The sea salt made it very dry and hard to chew. The chocolate had turned ashy.	-1
Too sweet for my palate.	-1
showed up busted open and all over my 116-dollar pantry box. good goin. oh, and the flavor sucks too.	-1
My kids wouldn't eat this and after I tried it, I don't blame them. We had to toss.	-1
This is very very sweet due to the cherry flavor. I wish I had read the ingredients label a lot more closely. A lot of apple juice and very little pomegranate. I should have realized this as this product is less than a third of Pom Wonderful in cost. I will not purchase again.	-1
I have heard so much advertised about this juice that I decided to try it since my husband and I are big fans of regular V8 juice. I am sorry to say it was not as good as I thought it would be, not much flavor for a juice that is supposed to taste like cherry and pomegranate. I found it to be more like a watered down kool aid drink, and it does not meet the standard of quality that I have always found in their vegetable juice. I really hope they go back to the drawing board on this one, because someone must not have tasted this before they put it on the market, and the price point is extremely high. Sorry but that is my opinion, maybe others like it but I do not, especially from a company with a great reputation for high quality products, as a consumer this does not meet the standards I am used to from you.	-1
Has 6-7 1/2" chunks of what they call chicken. It must be from DRIED CHICKEN FEET because it is  tasteless, dry, stringy and one has to chew, chew, chew, ..., and finally when one is tired of CHEWING SOUP, swallow the strings. The white rice is MUSHY. IF there is wild rice it must be from a city named Wild and not real wild rice.  I suppose they made it mushy so it would be easier to swallow the pieces of reconstituted chicken(or whatever they are).  I bought two of these and the 2nd is going to have all the so-called chicken removed and replaced with chunks from Swanson's canned chicken( which, BTW, actually tastes and feels like chicken ), plus add 6oz of mixed (frzn) vegetables and 2 cloves of sliced garlic.  ...or just throw it away. (I'd give it to Food Bank to be used but why do that to them? They have enuf problems... ). It might be fun to watch a cat try to chew the pseudo chicken chunks but that would be cruel. I.e., not fit for pets, much less humans.  Would not buy again. ...not even for a buck, and certainly not for 2+change.	-1
This mac and cheese is absolutely terrible. The pasts is gluten free and they may have something to do with it. However the cheese flavoring ( made from real cheese ) is disgusting. Does not even come close to a cheese taste. I cant even describe what the taste was only that it was nothing like cheese, almost like chemicals. Also when i followed directions as on package some of the noodles stuck together and did not cook at all they were just a hard clump. Needless to say will not be buying these again	-1
This stuff is not...but it is poop! Do you like eating poop? Then buy this product. For all others, this stuff is not for your consumption. Avoid it so you will forgo having to deposit it later in the place, in the toilet, this stuff belongs.	-1
Ick!  Too much peanut butter in these, almost to the point they are sogging and I love peanut butter.  Whatever is on the outside as well is too sugary.  They need to make it plain.	-1
Boring!  Not as "Peanut Buttery" as I had hoped.	-1
Better off eating toast with peanut butter with extra sugar. The peanut butter filling is disappointing and they would be better with a frosting coating instead of sugar.	-1
ok	-1
do you like pop-tarts? do you like peanut butter? if so, don't try these.	-1
This soup is so BLAND...not spicy at all!  And as soon as I opened the can I was hit with a HORRIBLE smell...it was like someone had pooped in my kitchen after abusing their digestive system!!!!  I kid you not, it took me FOREVER to get rid of that smell and it spread into my living room and hallway too.  Needless to say, I will *not* purchase this again. Campbell's WTH???	-1
The super jumbo kidney beans!!! half the can was kidney beans! Yuck! This may have OK if there were no beans.	-1
Gifts.	-1
Unstable...it's the cheese like sauce the put in this ,+salty	-1
It didn't taste that good. I wouldn't buy again.	-1
Too expensive	-1
Some of the stew cans were old with green mold which apparently exploded during shipment covering the other  items and the box with the green mold and contents.  This was shipped to my brother in college and he apparently thought one item was ok and got a bad case of food poisoning, vomiting for a week, We had to discard the shipment.  Obviously, the stew was too old and should not have been shipped in the first place.	-1
All of the cans were so bent and broken I threw them all out. A waste of time and money!	-1
This was awful	-1
Ordered with the Prime Pantry items, and I did not like this soup..  The liquid part was OK but never did find any broccoli in it.  There was one piece of something which may have been cheese but couldn't tell for sure.  Will not purchase this item again.  Still appreciate the convenience of delivery to my door.  Not recommended.	-1
What a misleading name. What you really get is bland chunks of potato in a vaguely cheesy sauce. Any presence of broccoli or chicken is a downright lie.	-1
Not sure if it was just this bag, or if I have grown out of my enjoyment of twizzlers?  I ate a few and gave the rest to my mother. I will not be ordering again.	-1
A gift.	-1
I used to order this product once a week and loved it and now sadly its no longer available for amazon prime and if you see it the price is so high its just crazy.  What a pity	-1
meh	-1
Palm oil YUCK,  They should be required to have a big sticker or stamp on products that use stuff like this or allergens or GMO.	-1
I was really disappointed in this Philly Style Cheesesteak Chunky Soup. There was no taste whatsoever and it was very watery. I have never seen a Chunky soup as watery as say a chicken noodle soup. I am use to them being  more of a creamy soup like that of a potato or chowder style soup. I don't recommend this experience to anyone.	-1
Nasty, never will buy again	-1
Nearly inedible.  There are more ingredients on the spoon on the label than there are in the entire can.  Seriously just a can of white, flavorless gravy with 3-4 potato cubes, 5-6 flecks of green pepper, and maybe 3-4 fingernail sized pieces of grey meat.  Hate wasting food, but the second can went in the trash.	-1
This company seems to have zero quality control. How else to explain that some of the Chunky soups--which I have happily five-starred-- come from the same company that produced this watery, flavorless concoction? The soup depends upon the  thin yellowish-white stock to establish the "cheese" credential but its already mentioned lack of flavor means that whatever this product is, it lacks a crucial ingredient and the word "cheese" in the title  is simply misleading. The "steak"  ingredient is several tiny thin pieces of meat.which lack the thickness, the heft, the substance and the flavor to resemble  the satisfactory beefiness of  even the worst  cheesesteak sandwich I enjoyed  while living in the Philadelphia area.  Finally, the necessary onion component is essentially missing here--I found a very few small pieces of onion so overprocessed  they lend scant flavor. There are also a very few very small potato cubes which, of course, have nothing to do with a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. I truly urge you to bypass this product.	-1
1not as tasty a s I had hoped.	-1
heh, tastes and smells like cheesesteak. i dunno man. goes well with crackers.	-1
too salty	-1
i'll pass on this.	-1
Weird taste	-1
Tasted a little bacony - but not what I was expecting.  We ate it, but I would not purchase it again.	-1
Purchased this from my local grocer thinking I would love the combination of peanut butter and white chocolate ... after all, what's not to like about a peanut butter cup? .... but this spread was a disappointing dud.  The white chocolate flavor is a very muted white chocolate flavor, seems to simply add an in-your-face brash sweetness to the spread.  As if a bunch of sugar was added to peanut butter.  While labeled as a creamy spread, the texture has an unpleasant grainy mouth.  With the overly sweet taste and grainy texture, I literally could not eat it when I tried it on both toasted whole grain bread and toasted sourdough bread.  I then tried the spread in a peanut butter cookie recipe.  Another dud.  The cookies baked flatter, the peanut butter flavor was muted, and I could not distinguish a white chocolate flavor.  The cookies turned out way too sweet and flat, and went in the trash along with the jar of White Chocolate Wonderful Spread.	-1
Not a fan but the rest of the house loves it, I will stick with regular peanut butter. It does not have the least bit of chocolate flavor to me but the guys say it does to them so take this with a grain of salt. All about your taste buds on this one,	-1
filled with bad stuff...no good!	-1
I was expecting this to be a box of 12 family size pouches (as pictured) this is one small package of potatoes. I found this to be very disappointing experience and I shall not order this again.	-1
I had high hopes because the only canned icing i can tolerate is the unwhipped cream cheese flavor. But this icing has a vague,  chemical taste, not enough cream cheese flavor and a too soft texture. Not too my taste, unfortunately.	-1
For Pete sake I really need to grow up.  I can't believe I ordered that.  It is so full of sodium it is ridiculous.  I ate it by the truckload when I was a kid.  Mom didn't know any better.  I have grown wiser in my food choices and make my own soup now.	-1
Disappointed.  Soup not thick like it used to be.  I used it in cooking.	-1
received dented cans had to throw away	-1
Watery, thin, and questionable quality. Pass.	-1
Just reviewing the product here. Service/delivery was perfect. The product itself, tastes like crap! Way too much salt (sodium) in it (about 50% of the daily recommended value), and the bitter flavor of 'can'. that's all it tastes like.  They make quite the amount of money for a penny's worth of spaghetti, a few grams of chicken, and chicken grease!  No vegetables, no spices, no flavor other than can, and salt.  I won't be buying this anymore!	-1
always bent cans, that i can't use. i give up	-1
To much grease	-1
to much sodiom	-1
I mostly like the taste.  Too much salt tho.  Will be giving it to local free food pantry.  I've found other Campbell's chicken noddle soup that I oke better.  The Campbell's stuff I like the most also costs the most. Figures.	-1
Get Chunky Classic Chicken Noodle Soup, if you're sick, in a pinch & need chicken soup - it's good for you. MSG IS NOT! If they'd remove the MSG in this I'd re evaluate but MSG is BAD, m'kay? So if you're sick & need chicken soup in a pinch do NOT get THIS. Not as good as homemade but it will do in a pinch, if you're sick, & even has easy pull tabs which even a kid can use.	-1
All of the cans in this multi-pack were dented, each in more than one spot.	-1
Blech! This is basically expensive Jif peanut butter. It has sugar and palm oil. I did not read the ingredients. It said 'natural' peanut butter. So palm oil, sugar (dried cane juice LOL) are from nature. They are found in nature as they are plants. But calling it 'natural' is misleading since one is thinking 'oh, all peanut peanut butter' rather than 'peanuts mixed in some oily miasma that is terrible for the environment (palm oil),  raises cholesterol and blood sugar.'  It doesn't taste good if one wants one's peanut butter to taste liked the butter of peanuts. I almost spit it out when I first tasted it I was so surprised at that tasteless margarine smooth oil flavor & texture.  Anyway, it is exactly the same thing as Peter Pan, Jif and the like but packaged in a way to fool you in thinking that it's actually good and healthy peanut butter.	-1
COME ON NOW, ITS SOUP--CAMPBELLS	-1
ITS SAD, THAT THIS IS NOT THE SAME TOMATO SOUP I HAD AS A KID, THIS IS SOOOOOOO BLAND AND VIRTUALLY NO TOMATO TASTE.	-1
not so good	-1
garbage.  wifey likes ,	-1
Tastes nothing like it did in the 80s. It is like eating colored kix.	-1
too much sugar, but tasty	-1
Disgusting	-1
Not a huge fan tasted ok but just didn't pack a lot of cinnamon flavor like we expected.	-1
It's been a long time since I purchased cereal in a box.  I am sorry I did.  This tasted like sugar and broke down. I don't think it is good in taste or value.  I will never purchase this again.	-1
Not popular with chocolate fans in my house.	-1
I find this cereal too bland for my liking.	-1
Good product/Very Bad Packing!	-1
no go on these. They don't taste like nut. Or banana. Or good.	-1
Was picked up by mistake by family member during a rush in/out trip to the grocery.  Cereal only has a hint of what appears to be an imitation cinnamon taste and the chex squares themselves were not as crunchy as what we have become used to in our always purchased Kellogg's brand.  Would never purposely buy any GM brand as a result of their recent string of disgusting commercials.	-1
Says it contains real bananas but I don't taste them at all.  I would prefer regular Cheerios or Honey Nut Cheerios over this.	-1
Gross, doesn't taste natural at all. I should have known better. Tossed the rest of the box after trying them.	-1
Box was squashed by other products in the box and I had to throw it out and put the cereal in another container.	-1
Was gross.  Too cheesy and creamy.  Maybe I'm just too used to Hambuger helper which has a tangier taste.	-1
I forgot how aweful these Velveeta Cheesy Skillets are.  I made this the other day and it made my meat taste rotten.  I had to spit it out, my husband loved it but me however could not eat it.  I was pretty disappointed because it smelled so good when I was cooking it.	-1
Ecch. Mistake to buy this. Too salty, cheap, and worth every $1.87. Gross product; make your own from a can of soup, a handful of noodles, and a few slices of cheese. Cheaper, much better, and even easier.	-1
very salty	-1
Weird  after taste of chemicals	-1
I don't like the taste of it.	-1
I got some of these for my son to try and he didn't like them because they had large chunks of red and green pepper in them.	-1
Not that great. The flavor is a bit off.	-1
The food looked and smelled good before I put the mixed the cheese packet in.  I don't know if the cheese may have spoiled or something in the original contents.  The product had a strange sweet but sour taste.  Maybe everything was spoiled but I did not think to test taste before adding the cheese sauce.  The food tasted nothing like lasagna but had more of a creamy soupy texture perhaps from the noodles settling for so long inside its container.  I only hope I did not get food poisoning.	-1
I have purchased the Velveeta shells with regular Velveeta and it was fab, but this is THE WORST TASTING YUCK, IT IS NOT LASAGNA, IT TASTES LIKE HOT SAUSE FOR BEANS WITH A CREAMY SOMETHING IN YOUR MOUTH, I WILL NEVER BUY THIS AGAIN. I WROTE TO THE COMPANY, THIS IS HORRIBLE. IT ISNT EVEN WORTH A STAR.	-1
nasty taste	-1
Okay, this stuff is incredibly gross. I tried to eat it...I did. But it's not edible. And it also smells very, VERY bad...my entire apartment smelled for hours after making one of these.	-1
BARF Did not like it.. Looked disgusting after I mixed it up. Just taste like processed garbage. Don't waste your money unless you're looking for a trip to the toilet.	-1
It's really chemically tasting and just bland overall.	-1
Not that great.	-1
Velveta Lasagna Is not like a lasagne, with large rectangular pasta, besides it we abe equal to a good Italian lasagna  Keebler Ice Cream Waffle Cones, 12 Count They came all are broken	-1
yuk	-1
Would not recommend. It isn't horrible but the flavor is just very chemical tasting.	-1
Bought these for my been yfridend he broke up with me soon after	-1
These taste awful.	-1
absolutely terrible, i wasn't expecting much from this since it is a prepared meal very easy to make but tastes bad not even edible	-1
Just like all prepackaged lasagna products this also is not very good.	-1
sodium levels way too high would like to return it.	-1
This had a strong weird taste like Annatto or something. Could have been msg... but it didn't belong in a cheesy meal or Lasagna. Overpowering. Not horrible horrible, just not the taste I was expecting and a bit strong.	-1
Again, another microwaveable meal. We shared one to test it out and it's ok. Very Very Very processed and will work when in a rush or a pinch.	-1
I hate to say this, but I ate 1.5 of these tonite (they're quite small) and it did not (is still not) sitting well with me.  Maybe I'm stupid, but I associate Velveeta with yellow, cheddar-like cheese, but the sauce in the packets of these was pretty much white (not pure, but not beige).  The taste by itself was totally bland, no real cheese flavor.  Despite BOTH having exactly 3 small pieces of green pepper, it was overwhelmingly green pepper flavor. (there were a couple red pepper pieces, too, but no flavor from them).  I currently have rather bad heartburn (I do not normally have problems with that), I've already been unwell once from one end and the other end hasn't decided yet.  I do not have a delicate stomach - I am allergic to citrus but I wouldn't expect it to be an issue with lasagna, and even so, I do not feel short of breath as I would normally be had it been a citrus issue - I just feel sick to my stomach.  Totally unexpected bad experience with what I normally associate as a good brand.	-1
Tasteless and mushy	-1
I didn't like this at all!  It's easy to fix but has little flavor...	-1
I don't eat any kind of lasagna but I bought these for my mom and brother to try (they like lasagna). My mom doesn't want to try this one. She didn't even consider trying it after looking at it. My brother did choose to try his and he didn't like it due to the red pepper (flakes I think) in it. He tried to pick out as much as he could but it still was loaded with them. Won't be buying again though.	-1
This is Chef Boyardee quality at three times the price. When you peel back the top, be prepared for an awful smell.	-1
This is the kind of creamer you use when theres literally just no other option. It tastes a bit too chemical-ly to me and makes me too paranoid to use it most of the time. Actually now that I think of it I bought one of their other flavored coffee powders before in the past (I think it was called macchiato??) and had the same problem but the flavored one was definitely worse.	-1
Too small for the price.	-1
Didn't come in the pictured cup.	-1
It says this stuff is 3 times the strength of the variety found in the dairy section of your grocery store. It is thick, the consistnacy of condenced milk. Flavor is much weaker than other kind.	-1
This was NOT a long lasting product! I used it up in about 4 cups of coffee. Would NOT recommend!	-1
bottle was cracked	-1
I must be the odd man out because I didn't like this at all. The hazelnut flavor is very artificial and unpleasant. There is a slight bitterness from the chemical. It doesn't taste like real food.  On the positive side, it dissolves easily and it lasts a long time before spoiling. It's a convenient option for those who like this sort of thing.	-1
It says this is 3 times the strength of the normal liquid kind found in the dairy section of your grocery store. The flavor in fact tastes weaker. It is much thicker, the consistency of condensed milk.  Just has a very weak peppermint flavor compared to the real thing :(	-1
nasty tasting and only 14 day use after opening, will stick with powder to travel with	-1
hate it sorry	-1
THIS IS SUPER NASTY JUST GET ONE OF THE REGULAR FLAVORED CREAMERS. IT TASTES WAY TOO ARTIFICIAL YOU CANT EVEN JUST USE A LITTLE AND GET PAST IT. ITS. THAT. BAD. LEARN FROM ME. FRENCH VANILLA OR ORIGINAL IS ALWAYS THE BEST WAY TO GO FOR THE POWDER CREAMS.	-1
for some reason i thought these would be sour or have some fruit flavor, but no. they taste only like sugar or corn syrup.	-1
Most candy I receive from Amazon is fresh however this bag had dried up and hardened fish in it. Probably about 10% of bag was like this. Unsure if there was a hole in bag or what, so didn't eat any.	-1
They changed the package, fine.  It's bold and TOTALLY X-treme1!1!!!!!  dude.  Fine.  No, the problem is that they changed the FISH.  It's a different mold.  The fish are tiny.  And, the worst part... the recipe.  It seems like the "cherry" flavor is way overboard; it's so strong it's making my tongue numb.  It kinda tastes like chemical wood lacquer.  They New Coke'd Swedish Fish...  a candy I've loved forever because of what it was.  This isn't it.  So sad now.  :'(	-1
Very confusing regarding the quantity, reading the Q&A some say they got 4, one even said they got 2, I received 1, thought I was getting 4. Yes I thought that was dirt cheap, but I don't know what the deal actually is supposed to be and the commentary in that Q@A wasn't helpful.  Please put one box in the picture if that's all I'm supposed to get or give me the other 3 boxes I was supposed to get.  Thanks	-1
Yikes not the sweet tarts I remember as a kid.  I guess I didn't pay close enough attention when I ordered them	-1
Um so Sweethearts of this kind are basically the most sour Warheads candy, ahhh!  Imagining them right now, my mouth is foaming!  I love sour candies, spicy foods..  But these are intense to where you want to be DONE with them!	-1
this had an aftertaste, and I will not be buying it again.	-1
Not as good as Reece's peanut butter cups	-1
I am very fair skin so I did not need or want a huge change all at once. I used this every day for 2 weeks. Nothing. It is just plain lotion. Not worth the money.	-1
Blegh!!!!	-1
Horrible!  Do not waste your money.  Tried eating one cup, ugh!  Never again will I buy anything  from McDougal.	-1
Nasty. I fed it to our pet pig.	-1
I ordered these to keep in my desk at work for busy season as a back up for when I'm too busy or forget to pack a lunch. All I can say is BLECH!  It might not have been so bad if it wasn't for the awful fake lime flavor.  I couldn't even give them away.	-1
Not so great. Tasted like diet food. Sadly the noodles NEVER really become noodles, just crunchy bits. I followed directions and completely waited forever for the noodles... Was dissatisfied.	-1
I really wanted to like this but can't. The taste is nothing near pad thai. Will not buy any Dr. McDougalls instant noodles anymore. Nongshim would be a safer choice and usually authentic.	-1
Not very tasty	-1
Smells delicious, looks questionable, tastes like nothing. I mean literally nothing. No flavor whatsoever. The noodles are way too soft. I would've given it one star, but I gave a star because the broth tastes good.	-1
Not my favorite taste...	-1
Very disappointed in this soup, and surprised given my positive experiences with other McDougall's products.  Even when stirred vigorously in accordance with the directions on the cup, the flavoring doesn't dissolve well and in fact leaves these congealed clumps that are just gross in texture when eating the soup.  Plus, I don't really detect much in the way of lime flavoring in the soup.  Most definitely won't be buying these again.	-1
I really wanted to like this, and the taste is okay.  It is too pasty for me.  I feel like even though I tried mixing it all different ways including with the directions, it never really seems like soup, more like paste, and the powder part never completely dissolves.  I was really hoping for more.	-1
I've never eaten goat feces, but I imagine this is what they would taste like. Disgustingly horrible.	-1
Tooo Salty.	-1
This product is quite honestly pretty bland.  Lacks in flavor and only distant hints of spice.  A pretty weak mixture overall.	-1
The lollipop is very good but the pepperoni is covered in this weird juice and the cheese really smells bad.	-1
The box contained a fruit rollup type thing that I really hated; a cup of unsweetened applesauce that was good, but the cup was rather small; two crispy style chocolate chip cookies that were okay, but not as good as say Chips Ahoy; a 1.1 oz. packet of sunbutter (about 2 T, I'd guess); and some crackers that were okay, not great.  The product description said there was a packet of trail mix, but in my box the applesauce was substituted, which I was happy about.  I didn't particularly care for this product, but I can see that this might appeal to kids or to people who are really into health foods.	-1
Some of the stew cans were old with green mold which apparently exploded during shipment covering the other  items and the box with the green mold and contents.  This was shipped to my brother in college and he apparently thought one item was ok and got a bad case of food poisoning, vomiting for a week, We had to discard the shipment.  Obviously, the stew was too old and should not have been shipped in the first place.	-1
I purchased the health request soup as a healthier option to the regular chuncky soup, but unfortunately it also is tasteless.  I rather choose an alternative to eat then have something that does not have any flavor.	-1
a gift.	-1
Awful! Had to add some himalayn pink salt and chopped up cooked sausage to the soup to make up for the lack of good flavour and lack of beef chunks and force myself to eat this soup out of the desire to not see my money wasted. Never again will I buy this soup.	-1
BEWARE of HEALTHY CHOICE it tastes flat and has little flavor MY MISTAKE IT WAS HEALTHY CHOICE AND THEY ARE WATERY TASTING.  needs salt really bad,  it tastes flat and has little flavor.  I had to add corn starch to thicken it and salt and pepper, onion and garlic powder just to eat it.	-1
Thick and rich looking, but not very tasty.  Will jot buy again	-1
This was sort of a disappointment, something like those kid lunches with all the little sides. There weren't many plantain chips and they were sort of dry and flavorless. The dip was essentially refried beans with a bit of chili powder.	-1
As with some of the other GoPicnic packages I reviewed, there were not enough plantain chips for the dip. Why do they only give you  chips for such a large container of dip? My favorite part was the trail mix (ginger zip, I believe). The edamame was bland and the dip was nothing special. It's supposed to be a lunch, but I was still hungry after I finished eating it.	-1
Dip was ok - small amount there was of it, no crackers or corn chips - picture on pkg is deceiving. Tiny packets smelled rancid. [Quickly went out of date after receiving.] Waste of money for me.	-1
Not very tasty. Crackers are stale'	-1
Not a fan of this! Wasn't what I expected. Very small portions, yea snack size... Just not a great taste.	-1
all packaging and not much substance. overpriced	-1
SODIUM CONTENT HIGH	-1
The main course: Very bland crackers, not nearly enough asiago cheese spread and low-quality tasteless salami. Accompanied by no plastic utensil to spread said asiage cheese spread.  Snack: A small handful of a Cashew Medley which actually was pretty good.  Dessert: Chocolate wafer-type snack which also was okay but nothing to get excited about.	-1
OK. It's a kiddie meal. Its geared to dumb kids and fat ass parents. Get some taco shchmell!  Keep the moisture on you snacks	-1
The meal contained some Asiago cheese spread which was good, but there wasn't much of it; some tiny slices of salami, which were good; some crackers that tasted like saltless saltine crackers, that were okay; some tiny cookie bites that I didn't care for, but I think some people would like; and something they called cashew medley, that should have been called raisin medley because it was mostly raisins.  In the future, I will just buy some cheese spread and whole wheat crackers instead of this.  Not worth the price.	-1
they might have went bad.	-1
all packaging and not much substance. overpriced	-1
Really bland. I was disapointed.	-1
The turkey was a processed meat.	-1
Not what I thought it was. A box lunch in a box. nice and salty.	-1
wasn't really that impressed with this at all. Sure, it's nice that you can keep it in the pantry and it doesn't take up fridge space. but the meat has a funky taste, the fruit stick was like biting rubber and the crackers were basically triscuit type chips. I did enjoy the cheese spread and the applesauce though....However that isn't worth the cost of the product.	-1
Ugh...talk about bland and ugh..a lunch Charles of any kind d,beats this-only it had going for it was the applesauce!!	-1
Blah taste, some parts don't taste good at all!  Way overpriced.	-1
"I do not like green eggs and ham, I don't not like them Sam-I-am" ... ahhhh the childhood memories of Dr. Suess. It's amazing what we retain to memory... when I opened the turkey packet to find green mold growing on a turkey slice I immediately thought of Sam-I-am.  To be fair to the GoPicnic brand.... I love this concept and have purchased just about every "flavor". The latest order of turkey & cheddar (Jan '16) has an expiration date of May '16 so I presume these are at the end of their shelf life. It is pretty disgusting though to see green/white mold growing on something you were about to eat.... I'm not sure I will continue to purchase the brand, I may not buy them Sam-I-am.	-1
I hadn't seen this Hearty Cheeseburger soup before.  Having liked many other Campbell's Chunky soup, I purchased it before there was a review.  I wish now that I had waited. I was surprised to find that it was so watery &very Orange like a melted crayon. It neither looks , smells, or tastes like cheese.  The five lumps of meat did not taste like any beef product I have eaten before. There are some potatoes as well. They also have no taste. In my opinion the Cheeseburger should be insulted this product shares it's name with this soup. I don't recommend this soup.	-1
Nearly all the Chunky soups over the past five years have become tasteless -- the clam chowder suddenly becoming the worst --and this is no exception.  I used to buy Chunky soups by the dozen cans, any flavor, esp. Sirloin Burger and the other beef ones -- then one day about six years prior, the 'Sirloin' suddenly tasted like dog food.  Yeah, and that's how this one tastes, too.  Not at all reminiscent of 'cheese' or 'burger'.  Now, maybe it will taste better to you.  As for me, this review marks the end of my Campbell Chunky soup buying.  The soup which used to really 'eat like a meal', now makes you wonder if you had one.	-1
Meat is not good, gave to the dogs	-1
Its good, but it's not something I'll buy again.	-1
funny taste	-1
i'll pass on this.	-1
Way too much chese for my taste.	-1
Love this cleaner. Bottle had been rewrapped because it was leaking. Lost a lot of the cleaner inside the wrapping. HAd leaked through and wet the box	-1
Oops, made a mistake. Thought this was for HE, it is not, and I bought two huge bottles, mistake. I guess HD is not the same as HE right?	-1
Leaves sore bumps on my tongue and side of my mouth.  Maybe I'm allergic to something in this gum because it's never happened with any other cinnamon gum.	-1
It was not that good. It was chewy like gum is supposed to be but the cinnamon flavor was lacking and died out quickly.	-1
Not very effective for the hand washed pots and pans. Didn't at all care for the feel of the soap.	-1
Worst dish soap I have ever used. I would not have thought it possible for a dish soap to be so ineffective.	-1
I love Mrs Meyers everything. I buy the hand soap, the dish soap and the multi purpose spray. I decided to try this new scent (new to me) and I just can't stand the smell. I am terribly disappointed with this purchase. I paid full price for this item and this is my opinion.	-1
Not impressed. Much better organic cider vinegars out there for less$	-1
Not open it yet ,I may be return it why,  I was looking veggies one and it's not mentioning it's veggies ,gelatin but not mention what kind off it,	-1
If you like mildly unsweetened-chocolate-flavored cardboard, these are for you.  The coconut had no flavor, just got stuck in my teeth.  Way, way disappointed.  They get one star because the manufacture date AND the exp date are both printed on the wrapper, and because I couldn't give it zero..	-1
As far as taste goes- they're great.  Could eat them like candy.  Just wish vitamins had some kind of noticeable effect.  Used the bottle as directed.  If they helped any, I didn't see it.  But they do taste good for those of you wanting vitamins that don't like to swallow pills.	-1
Upsets my stomach very badly	-1
I like "free and clear", and I love Seventh Generation soap and laundry products, but these panty liners were very disappointing. They were very flimsy and didn't perform well at all. I had to use twice as many as I normally use in one day.  I could take a brand new one and literally shred it with my fingers with very little trouble. I would not recommend these.	-1
I've bought lots of different liners over the years and to be honest these are not something I would buy again.  They are incredibly thin, not to mention how short they are.  Just not a very good value in my opinion.	-1
Worst taste ever.  I will force them down eventually with strong coffee but never get this flavor again.  Milk chocolate is not my thing.	-1
This was my new favorite cheat food; as taste is amazing! BUT it leaves my stomach in painful cramps for days after I eat it, so I will have to find a new cheat food:(  Researched the "natural" sweetener and found out that all my serious  stomach aches, pains and cramps are common side effects. Also found out that the same "natural" sweeter can and WILL KILL DOGS IF THEY EAT IT!!!! BEWARE, DON'T FEED TO ANY ANIMAL!!!  HORRIBLE PRODUCT DON'T BUY	-1
I expected the consistency of peanut butter with toffee bits in it but it's more the consistency of sour cream with toffee flavor.	-1
Needs larger rock sea salt to bring out the flavor more. The dark chocolate isn't all that good	-1
I am a huge Lindt fan and love most of their flavors, but in this case I felt the salt took away from the chocolate.  It gave it almost a soapy flavor.	-1
Fail, barely had any mint flavor, I tasted it more burping after I ate it than I did eating it.	-1
Tastes great, but stick to buying in stores. When mine showed up, every can was dented and sticky, even though none of them seemed to be leaking.	-1
did not work well. Messy	-1
Didn't really enjoy this coffee compared to other ones we've tried for single serve.  It lacked robustness that other dark roast coffees offer.	-1
THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT PACKAGED WELL.  ARRIVED WITH A PEPSI FIZZING AND IT MADE A MESS IN MY KITCHEN.  I GAVE THE REST TO A FRIEND.  I WILL NOT TRY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.	-1
when i got these they were so damaged, i couldn't even send them back. the cans smashed,some of them busted open, boxes were wet and falling apart i was upset. all i ask is to replace them	-1
Yuck chemicle taste,give me cherry coke anyday.	-1
id rather drink rancid toilet water than this product from a horrible company like pepsi	-1
Kinda mushy.	-1
Not good.	-1
Watch out this loaded with "High Fructose Corn Syrup....BAD!!	-1
not bad	-1
didnt like it very much it did taste bad	-1
Gross. No natural sweetness at all.	-1
OK, I know green is supposed to be good for you, but the overpowering apple base of this drink just ruins it for me. The apple juice is too sweet and it just doesn't pair right with the other juices. Yuck! If you like apple juice, maybe it's for you. Good price, if I liked it.	-1
I used this for my SENSITIVE SIN and it immediately BURNED my face! I had to rinse my sin for a good ten minutes with cold water to get the burning to stop. I reported this to Amazon and the representative said she'd tell AMAZON HQ  about this bad experience. TERRIBLE experience and the burning was awful!	-1
These tend to burn my face, specifically under my eyes, but not that good tingling feeling--more like an actual burn. They also have a terrible smell. Useable, but I won't buy them again.	-1
Didn't like the taste	-1
This is the first flavor I've tried of this product. Not impressed. The taste of pink grapefruit is barely noticeable. Had a chemical after taste.	-1
I orderrd these as an alternative to sugar based soft drink beverage. Ugh. The after taste( sweetness) was too much to tolerate.	-1
Tastes weird.	-1
I don't often review food products because taste is so subjective.  I took a chance on this because the reviews were good, and I like sweet, sparkling water drinks.  I was looking for a new low or no calorie option when this popped up.  I usually love things flavored with guava, but not this one.  This drink was so bad I couldn't even finish one can. It smells and tastes like very, very bitter grapefruit. I actually like pink grapefruit drinks, but this was so bitter I had to add a packet of Splenda just to drink a few swallows.  Given the high price ($10.50 for four slim cans as of this writing), I'm afraid to try another flavor.  My recommendation is to see if you can find one can in a grocery store to try first...	-1
As advertised	-1
Not good	-1
I thought this was Rice Krispy cereal, not little rice krispy treats loaded with sugar!  The label on the box is a little misleading with the "Treats" portion of the label written in cereal, so you can easily miss it.  If you are looking just for the cereal, this is not it!	-1
pieces are really big in this and puffs are larger than I would have expected.  Bought as a "cool cereal" for my 3 yr old but the texture was too different from the "original marshmallow cereal" if your kid is a texture kid... Aside from this, the pieces lack a "hero" shape that one would expect from an Avengers cereal, the box is the only thing going for...stil with Lucky Charms	-1
Did care for much. Ate this as snack straight from box.	-1
Not the best, probably really good for those that really love sugar.	-1
Trip down memory lane, but as with a lot of cracker type products, I think a lot of the contents got crushed en route.	-1
One was moist like the seal broke	-1
I wanted these vitamin c pack. I received cherry halls.	-1
CRUSHED	-1
old	-1
husband did not like them	-1
I saw these advertised on tv not too long ago and watched for them at my local grocery, but never saw them.  I decided to give them a try so I ordered them with my Prime Pantry order.  I'm not a fan of this flavor.  If you are a big garlic lover, you will like these.  It was too strong a garlic taste for me.	-1
No So Good	-1
Got it was supposed to but condition was poor, alot of the chips where crushed	-1
crumbs	-1
Unfortunately, I could not give a solid review of these chips because I received them (all the chips were broken and unusable).  Have eaten Lay's chips before and they were great.	-1
Even though i greatly appreciate the sentiment, i can open my bag of chips fine on my own. Bag came opened and stale. Looks quite like the other stuff around the bag smashed the bag and popped it open. Pantry box looks like it's been kicked around a lot too.	-1
I love these chips and was excited to receive them, but Amazon's packaging kind of ruined them. While the flavor was the same great taste, Amazon had punctured a small hole in the bag in order to make the bag fit in the box and the chips were stale when they arrived. This has happened twice now, the other time with another brand. I don't advise ordering chips through Amazon. However, these chips are typically very good with that extra crunch that Kettle Cooked chips often provide. I would just stick to purchasing these at your local supermarket.	-1
Arrived with the seal broken so we couldn't eat them. It was an accident and broke open because of the other items in the box. I'd assume this was a fluke and would still order them again.	-1
Bugs in the bag	-1
heavy oil tasting	-1
These chips used to have quite a BITE to them. I think Lay's changed the recipe to make them very mild. They are just okay. These tasted a bit stale but the expiration date indicated they were fresh. I probably won't order these again, but may buy a small bag at the store.	-1
Wellll... No flavor, no taste, no salt.  Now I'm no expert taster but we do choose Lays over anything else for my husband and Daughter and these were like a Lays chip that was just the potato. I had just a couple to see if my daughter and husband were right and yes they were. Amazon was very quick at returningy my money and that was nice and easy.	-1
didnt care for it	-1
CRUSHED EVEN THE REPLACEMENT	-1
What have they done to crunchy Cheetos?  The almost hard, crunchy, delicious Cheetos I've loved all my life have changed into a semipuffed not-very-good imitation of crunchy Cheetos.  There is a softness on the outside that wasn't there before.  Maybe I got a stale package but I don't think so.  I've eaten a stale Cheeto or two and know how they taste and chew and the current package wasn't like that.	-1
Smashed, don't buy with anything heavy.	-1
Bland. Cheese Puffs are much better tasting.	-1
Old n stale. Couldn't eat.	-1
That is what this package says on the back in bold letters.  These potato chips are obviously made from genetic potatoes and are a bit pricey for such a small bag (8 oz).  They have a good crunch and are easy to eat but they have an indescribable taste and has more than just a salt and pepper taste.  These chips also have an unpleasant aftertaste.	-1
