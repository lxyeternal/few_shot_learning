I give facials with this product at work . The key is knowing what type of hydration in your skin you have . I find this perfect for those with oily or combo skin . I would not suggest this for anyone will dry skin or combo on the more dry surface to oily  ratio. However, the pump makes it easy to push and the foam suds up so that one pump goes a long way . The immortale in this is the main ingredient for anti agingand  brightening which it is  imported from Corsica France . I find this to be great for those with oily skin and a great cleanser for makeup as well ! I use this on both men and women and follow up with divine skincare by Loccitane also . This is a plant based only company so there are no crazy chemicals and their products are fair traded. Hope this review helps you decide ...	1
Excellent foundation. Very light going on and very hydrating, gives you a nice glow. I find the coverage to be light to medium perfect for the summer. The only downside, for me, is that I tend to get very shiny about half way through the day. I keep a light setting powder with me to keep this under control.	1
I love the La Roche-Posay BB Blur Foundation I have been using for a year.  I decided to try this hydrating one to see if I could skip a step or two (my moisturizing and age defying steps) in my morning routine.  I like my current foundation by La Roche-Posay better than this one.  I wish companies would keep the same color names across foundations, It would be so much easier to try multiple formulas.  I tried the 2 lightest colors-Light Beige and Ivory.  I'm very white, but the Ivory is ridiculously light.  When my husband saw me he said "boo."  I said "what is that for?"  "You look like a ghost," he replied.  The light beige was a better match to my skin tone, but still lighter than the other La Roche-Posay foundation.  This foundation is thicker than the BB Blur mouse.  It can be hard to apply, especially in the summertime.  I tried spreading it with my fingers and a foundation brush.  The brush spread better than my fingers, but left streaks, so I have to do a little of both to get the best coverage.  I took off 1 star for the coverage- being hard to put on.  Powder helps set the foundation, so I only need to apply once a day.  It looks better with powder.  I was concerned the moisturizer might make me break out, but did not.  I decided not to skip my other morning routine steps.  I'm not sure if this foundation helps, but it doesn't hinder moisturizing and age defying from my normal product routine. I'm going to use the rest of this foundation, but stick with the BB Blur.  Im going to save this for the cooler fall/winter.	1
I don't particularly care for this product. I did not notice any hydrating feature, in fact, It sort of sat on my skin rather than blending it in.	-1
This foundation from La Roche-Posay goes on nicely and leaves a sheer coverage.  I wouldn't use this during the workweek but this is a great weekend option for me when I don't want a heavy layer of foundation.  I use a light layer of this and use follow it with a light dusting of powder.  It lasts all day without breaking up and gives me a natural finish.	1
Love it! It goes on so smooth, you hardly feel it. But it looks great. Good coverage and helps even out the slight discoloring. It gets pretty hot where I live so I do have to re-apply if I want it to look as good as it did when I initially applied it. But otherwise, it feels and looks wonderful. This has become my favorite foundation.	1
I'm planning to order this in another shade, as this one is a little dark for me.  (However, i can still make it work, as the shade is very versatile.)  I really like this, though, so I will repurchase.  And a plan to repurchase is a pretty clear recommendation.  I have sensitive skin, and I am very pleased with the comfort of this product.  This is a sheer, versatile, comfortable, dewy tinted moisturizer type foundation.  Natural finish, well suited to summer.  Shades versatile and adapt well to skin.  Dewy but not overly so.  Natural looking foundation that doesn't dehydrate or irritate skin.  Skin care grade ingredients.  This is an excellent choice for those who like a light to buildable coverage.	1
There is no dripping or running down my face. However, it is difficult to spread needing lots blending or rubbing, which takes awhile to get it evenly applied. You definitely need to use a make-up sponge. No matter how hard you rub it in it will leave an orange line on the edge of your face. The shade looks different out of the tube than you'd expect and different still once applied. But maybe this shade would work better for someone else. It does cover blemishes well once you get it on and last a long time. So, in short, be careful of the true color of the tints and take plenty of time to apply and blend very well.	1
I was pleasantly surprised by this stuff - I'd definitely pick some up again! I've been using it by itself some days, and it provides good coverage for a more natural/less overly made up look. It works really well under powder, too (I use Jane Iredale mineral powder). The color blends very naturally into my fair-complexioned/cool skin tone.  This stuff stays on REALLY well throughout the day. You can tell it's going to last when you really have to scrub your hands with lots of soap and water after applying it just to get it off your hands!  My only concern here is that it ends up on my clothes if I brush against it while wearing - bad for white OR dark colored clothing. So, careful there...  Scent: not much of a scent, but it's not *great*. I'm very sensitive to smells, so I'm glad this isn't perfume-y. But it has a very light, almost chemical-y scent that I'm not a huge fan of. I think most people probably won't even notice it. (I have a VERY sensitive nose..)	1
Good concealer product, with a decent ability to conceal moderate blemishes, and does not leave skin very dry or flaky.	1
This didn't seem to improve my nails, but nice color	-1
This is the first styling iron I've used, and I fear it has spoiled me for cheaper brands. I love the features: the long cord, the case, the way it reduces the heat by 50% after not being used for three minutes, yet heats up quickly, and the auto shut off feature after one hour. Most of all I like the way you can set the temperature for hair type, getting results while minimizing damage resulting from overheating. My hair is becoming more coarse with age, but my teen daughters have fine hair, so being able to set a lower limit will be a great asset to them as they learn to use heat to style their hair. Best of all, though, are the results: shiny, healthy-looking, perfectly straight hair.  I expect my daughters to quickly move beyond this benchmark into more creative styles, but what a wonderful place to begin (and I can sleep easier knowing they can't damage the house either).	1
"Wild" sounds so much more exciting than "tame", except when it comes to things related to your personal appearance and grooming. A high quality Egyptian cotton shirt ls an unsightly disaster when you pull it from a clothes dryer. But tame the wild wrinkles and cotton fibers with a precision, temperature regulated iron and you have a sleek, crisp garment that literally makes you feel more professional and elegant when you slip it on.  That same civilizing effect happens when you apply the precise amount of heat to tame your curly, frizzy, disastrously wild hair. Curling irons abound at all different price points, but if the ceramic plates are inferior or the temperature is too high for your personal hair type, the effect can be to render more harm than good. Think scorched cotton shirt, except it's on your head taking maybe months to grow out.  Tacking the letters EPS, for Elite Professional Series, after this FHI heating iron's name may sound a little pretentious, and a marketing ploy, but it is extremely well designed and precisely functional. You can select 3 levels of heat to match your type of hair. The illuminated display is color specific which takes the guesswork out of the equation. Green is for fine or normal hair and is pegged at the 130 - 170 degree zone, Blue is for Wavy, Curly and Permed hair and is in the 170-200 degree zone and Red is for Coarse and very Thick hair.  There are just 3 buttons all on the side of the iron, one for power and the other 2 to select the correct color/temperature. The iron heats up quickly and the position of the buttons is out of the way so you don't accidentally change your selection during use.  If you don't use the iron for 3 minutes, it goes into sleep mode to conserve electricity and not overheat. Pick it up in sleep mode and it detects automatically and rapidly reheats to your preselected temperature. If you're in a hurry and run out of the house forgetting to turn off the iron, it will auto shut off after one hour.  Construction overall seems solid. It has a rubberized grip surface for better handling and lessening the possibility of slipping out of your hand.  The cord attachment at the rear swivels to lessen binding and allowed more freedom of movement.  Even the storage/carry case was well thought out and well made. Inside the flexible case there's a separating spline divider. The folded cord sits on one side and the iron on the other, just in case the iron has some residual warmth so you don't accidentally melt anything.  There's a large flap that encircles the case that is kept closed closed with a series of concealed magnets. That flap is actually part of a heat resistant mat that is held on the case with snaps. Place the iron on the mat during use to avoid scorching a bathroom surface or towel while attached to the case or unsnap it and use it separately. I can't comment on the durability of the ceramic plates, only time will bear witness as to it's durability and scratch resistance. But based on the rest of the construction, I feel confident the highest quality, most density consistent ceramic was used as advertised.  This is not an inexpensive iron, but especially if you have long hair and use an iron frequently, this is a quality product I can highly recommend. One caveat that alarmed me was in reading the guarantee card, it says it comes with a 2 year guarantee, but the guarantee is only binding if the iron is purchased from a salon or directly from the company web site. While all indications are that with the quality of the product you shouldn't run into problems, you might fire off an e-mail to the manufacturer's website to make sure that 2 year guarantee applies when buying the iron from Amazon. Overall an enthusiastic 5 star product, well thought out, precise, quality materials and construction and even an intelligent storage/travel case.	1
For straightening hair, this works PERFECT. I have hair that is impossible to curl, so I'm not the best reviewer for that, but it did keep a beautiful flat iron curl for a few minutes, per my normal. LOL  DO pay attention to the recommended heating levels. My hair used to fine; is more in the middle now.  But when I couldn't get the curls to stay I turned it up to max but it left weird crimping in my hair... I'm hoping it's not damaged now although it seems fine after washing.  I've never had a curling or flat iron do that, so I know it can go up higher than most, which is great if you need that level but no so great if you aren't being careful!  I love the grip... it's sensitive to your touch, so if you aren't using it for three minutes it will turn off; otherwise it can sense you are holding it and it stays on. It's easy to turn on and see what temperature you are at (and it has three color levels for even easier remembrance); and the biggest thing... you can't easily adjust the temperature WHILE you are curling. I've had major issues with my irons turning off on other models just by gripping it. Not with this one at all.  The hot part is a bit smaller than most flat irons, but it did such a nice job smoothing out my "easy to frizz" straight hair that I didn't care. Made it sleek and smooth.  Overall I am super, super happy... and the quality is top notch!  *A note on flat iron curling:  Take a small piece of your hair, and starting 3/4 of the way up, GENTLY grip the hair and rotate it AWAY from your head one full turn. Slowly pull it down the length of the hair and it gives you beautiful, loose and "beach" curls.  If you find it kinking, it's because you are gripping your hair too tight; be gentle!  If the lower part only curls, then you need to go slower at the top to allow it to curl more. Pretty easy!*	1
Heats up very fast within seconds. Allows you to control the temperature settings and the color display is neat. Runs very nice through your hair with ease. Flat iron also allows you to make beach waves. The case is heat resistant and stores the iron nicely and velcrow strap lets you tie up the cord. For about $**more than a Chi the Quality of the FHI is worth so much more.	1
Best iron yet. It is expensive at 200.00, but it does a terrific job at flat ironing my very long hair. It allows you to control the heat from 266 - 450 degrees, ceramic plates and it heats up fast. It has hand touch technology that offers safety and energy savings and automatically reduces the temperature in half when the tool isn't touched in 3 minutes. It does a terrific job at straightening even course hair. Wonderful product.	1
If you like gloss, then this is for you.  I use it about three times a day, it moistens my lips and it's shiny but limited color.  Great for summer.  I really like this product and I have bought in another color.	1
This is a great "nude" shade, although it runs a little "lavender."  Looks great on toes.	1
Love the color. Has a bit of a brown undertone to it, but it goes well with most grays.  Essie is a thicker polish, some of the darker colors will need 2 coats, but 2 coats is always best for a glossy finish. I type a lot and do hand work so it's nice to have a great color that lasts at least a week before looking like I've put my nails in the wood chipper!	1
Perfect color for the holidays!	1
This is a pretty muted purple/pink with an iridescent purple running through it. It has great dimension and the wear time is exceptional - however you will need at least 3 coats for it to be opaque.	1
Essie Cartel blue is a deep, rich navy blue. It's perfect for any time of the year.	1
Pretty color, but not as opaque as I'd hoped. Even with 3 coats, the white of my nails is visible.	1
Love this color and love Essie products.  I have long natural nails and Essie is my favorite reasonably priced polish for natural nails.	1
Love this color.	1
This nail polish is the best! Yes, it is kind of expensive, but it does last and the colors are always fresh and beautiful.	1
LaRoche-Posay is one of the few companies that manufactures beauty products without harsh chemicals or damaging elements.  They are rated well on websites that measure carcinogenic and toxic substances in products.  This formula works well, feels great, and does not leave the face feeling clogged or heavy.  Recommended!	1
This serum makes my skin feel bouncy and soft the next day. I love how nourishing it feels when applied, yet is not greasy or too moisturizing. I have oily skin, so am easily put off by anything too emollient-feeling. This feels like a lotion and serum mixed together. Very light texture and sinks in very quickly, yet the skin feels totally moisturized and comfortable after applying.  Out of the other serums La Roche-Posay offers, I am actually more inclined to use the Effaclar Serum (which I've purchased several bottles of), simply because it is more conducive to my skin type and what I look for in skincare. I have oily, somewhat congested skin, and am 32. Although I really like this Substiane serum, I don't think that I will purchase another when I run out..it's something I think I will really love 10 years down the road. I think my mom would really like it, actually. I still use it almost daily, but concentrate it on my neck more. If you have drier skin than I, or more mature skin, you will probably love this serum.  The biggest factor that keeps me from loving this serum is the scent. It has the typical, La Roche-Posay scent which many of their products have, BUT it smells as if it's almost expired...kind of plastic-y. Another product with the same scent (that I have also gone through many tubes of) is Effaclar K--I have had similar issues with it having a plastic smell. So, I'm sure it's not every bottle, and yes--the plastic scent does fade away--but it does irritate me when I first apply it. I thought it was worth mentioning because some are very sensitive to scent.	1
Works nicely to firm and smoothen skin. The first time it seemed to sting a little, but the next day it didn't. Maybe used too much on the first go? Anyway, this serum makes the skin look younger and smoother, and feel that way as well. Update: someone else said it stings a little. The next time she used less and it didn't sting, but she noticed new, small red spots on her face, which she thinks may be from this serum. So try just a little at first and see if you notice any issues.	1
I have been using this for a month and I'm just reviewing it now. I love La Roche-Posay products and this is the first one I will buy every month. It's worth the $65 as it's tightening effects are noticeable but not drastic. It's making my skin bright and supple.  Certainly worth trying if you're curious. I'm very happy with it as is my skin.	1
What you get is travel sized shampoo and conditioner with an leave in oil conditioner.  I DON'T KNOW WHY anyone would buy this collection when you can get the 8.5 fl. ounce size bottle of Agave Shampoo and the 8.5 fl. ounce Agave Conditioner for less. Sure the 'Healing Oil' is pricey, but to me there are lots of oils out there that smooth cuticles and I'd rather pass on two larger-sized bottles to my daughter to try than waste money.  SHAMPOO - the shampoo is nice.  It lathers well.  It cleans.  It didn't leave my hair feeling stripped.  I consider it a good shampoo.  CONDITIONER - this conditioner was also nice.  In the shower it left my hair easily combed out with a shower comb.  This was especially appreciated because my hair is in bad shape at the moment.  After I towel dried my hair though, and left it wrapped in a towel, my hair suddenly had knots.  HEALING OIL - I love the oil.  As I said my hair suddenly had tangles.  Instead of reaching for my usual fix of Miracle 10, I decided to try the oil.  It really got rid of the tangles.  I didn't use a lot, only rubbed the troubled hair with the oil.  It was easy to comb out after that.  Out of the 3 products I like the Oil best.  If you want to try all three I suggest you just buy the 8.5 ounce sizes rather than waste money on the smaller sizes.  The shampoo and conditioner are pleasant.  I found the oil darn useful.	1
The shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling absolutely wonderful.  I was impressed.  It does have a bit of a scent to it, and I prefer no scent at all.  Its not bad, though.  The oil worked wonders on the ends of my hair.  I have ash blonde hair, not known for its shine.  A touch of the oil made my hair gleam.  It did not make it look greasy or oily, which is the first product of its kind that I can say that about.  However, since that oil is a leave-in product, I did find the smell overwhelming.  It lasted all day.  For reference, I have very long, straight blonde hair.  Each strand is baby fine, but my hair over all is very heavy, as I have been told by various hair stylists that I have much more hair than the average person.  They regard it as one of the most difficult types of hair to work with as it cant hold a curl, its extremely fragile, and the thinness of each strand of hair and the overall weight contradict each other.  I received sample-size products.  I use a minimal amount of shampoo since I use no styling products at all, but I use a lot of conditioner.  There is enough conditioner here for two, maybe three, uses considering the length of my hair, which is down to my hips.	1
This reminds me of the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Biosilk-Trio/dp/B00PAY4NTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Biosilk Trio</a>&nbsp;that's more than double the size and less than three times the cost. This Agave Smoothing Trio is EXPENSIVE at the current price of $48 for three trial sized bottles.  What comes in the package: - 3 ounces of shampoo - 3 ounces of conditioner - 2 ounces of oil treatment  As per the box, this product is made in the USA.  The above is good for three to twelve uses for my neck-length hair. The shampoo is good for three washes for me. Since I use less conditioner and oil treatment than shampoo, I could get about five uses out of the conditioner and about twelve uses out of the oil treatment.  (PS A little oil treatment goes a long way.) I recently cut my hair but had I still had mid-back-length hair, I would probably have gotten two to eight uses out of this trio.  I love the coconut fragrance. The shampoo lathers well and conditioner detangles and softens my hair nicely. The oil treatment made my damp towel-dried hair look sleek and shiny. I have very curly hair, especially when it's short. Although this tamed my locks, my hair was still bouncy.  I love the smoothing trio and find it to be just as good as the Biosilk Trio I use periodically. The only negative I see is the exorbitant price for the amount of product received.	1
Excellent product. I love every product Ive used from this brand	1
Made me break out!	-1
using 3 day i saw the difference. great great .	1
Incredible quality brush that disassembles into the size of an old film canister- excellent. This brush really is high quality, unlike many cheap options this is definitely high-quality badger hair and not boar. The softness is luxurious for such a tiny format, it's quite nice.  My only gripe with this brush is that it might be "too" soft, I could use just a notch firmer to really feel comfortable working the soap into my beard. But the plusses outweigh the minuses overall. The case feels of good quality, and should survive some travel. Also of note is that when you close it, the ring to hold in the brush is open-ended for drying. This is a very nice touch.	1
This travel brush can be assembled in about two seconds. The top unscrews and hides inside the vial that also serves as the base of the brush. but it's not only great for travel. Because of it's compact size and lightweight (the brush itself is very light thanks to the fact that it's made out of aluminum and not ceramic as is often the case with badger hair brushes), it's easy to use daily even when not traveling.  Additionally, the hair of the badger is thick and strong, and distributes shaving cream evenly.  It's hard not to fall in love with this brush!	1
What you get is a simple badger brush labelled as 'pure' badger, this means it's of lower grade than the standard Baxter 'Best Badger' brush, it also has slightly less badger hair as well, but that's to be expected in a travel brush.  How this works, is that the aluminum (appears to be anondized, which means it's light and won't chip, etc) case has a piece on that top that threads on top of it, and then the brush has a threaded piece as well that threads into it.  If you take off the coupling piece, you can slide the brush underneath it, and the coupling will provide just enough material to prevent it from sliding out while providing ventilation.  As for a brush I would say it's quite close to the quality of the Best Badger brush, holding lots of water easily, and providing a great lather.  The balance is a bit odd since the handle is so light, and doesn't have a taper on it, not as great as a non-travel brush, but easily getting used to for a travel one. My only complaint was that it smelled quite strongly out of the package, but I believe this is to be expected sometimes, and rinsing/soaking it for a little bit will solve this.  The other thing if you need to shave and throw this back in your bag, the opening will allow it to dry a bit, but you'll want to air it out before you put it away, or as soon as you can at the end of the trip.	1
A bit about me, I've been wet shaving for probably close to 2 years, and in that time have tried about 20 brushes or so.  This brush arrived in a large cardboard tube, and inside was the packed brush and an instruction sheet.  The case for this brush is aluminum, and the knot fits inside the brush when not in use.  It's assembled by removing the ring at the top, taking out the knot, screwing it to the ring, and screwing the ring back to the case.  The quality of the materials was top notch, and I didn't notice any blemishes.  So on to the shave.  I heated up my scuttle, that has a brush warmer, and put some hot water on my soap.  I tried the brush with Mike's Rose/Cedarwood soap, which is fairly firm.  It soaked for about 15 minutes while I took a shower.  The soap lathered up easily with this brush, and it held a decent amount of lather.  I do generally prefer a denser knot than this brush had though.  During the lathering I did not see any shed hairs, so that was very good.  The brush wasn't at all floppy, and I was able to work the lather into my beard very well.  I did notice a strong animal scent with this brush, so you may want to deal with that pretty early on, especially if you plan to pack the brush and travel.  My only real problem with the brush, was when I was loading it and working up a lather it did tend to unscrew itself.  Not a huge problem, but distracting.  I wouldn't say it's my favorite travel brush, but it's a nice convenient setup which I would recommend.	1
I am a big fan of Vinylux nail polish. This is the top coat that seals in the color.  When I go for a pedi, my salon uses this polish, and it really lasts.  I am now doing my own manis with this product.  I refresh the topcoat every 4 or 5 days.  Works great on keeping my pedi nice.  Highly recommended	1
Love this polish!!!	1
Def worth it	1
The best	1
My husband really likes it.	1
This little brush is awesome. The silicone makes everything easy to clean. The battery seems to last forever. The pulse options are interesting, though I'm not sure the "anti-aging" setting will accomplish actual anti-aging, but it's nice to have variety!  I have very sensitive skin, both to products and just touch. This brush was gentle enough not to bother my skin too much. My face got red while I was using it but went back to normal almost immediately. (I'm one of those people whose eyebrows are red for 3 days after waxing - I've switched to threading. ;) )  This is great for cleansing as well as applying serums. It feels like a mini facial! This is not something I would have thought to buy on my own (it was a free product in exchange for a review through Amazon) but now that I've tried it, I'm a convert!	1
So as far as use goes, I do love this brush, I only knocked off a star because its so expensive. Honestly I am not sure it is worth that much. The only face brush I have ever owned is a cheap no-name one so this was definitely a step up! I love how the whole outside is silicone which washes off easily, doesn't retain moisture or smell and it compact. It is very easy to use and small enough that its not an eyesore. You simply put some face soap on the bristles and turn it onto your face.  The silicone bristles are not irritating in the least, I think for someone with sensitive skin, it would be amazing. I can handle anything so that didn't matter to me. I have not had to recharge this device yet either so it does last a good amount - perfect for traveling with as well! I haven't noticed a difference yet but will continue to use because its not going to hurt!	1
Ive gone through my share of expensive Clarisonic products for skin cleansing, and I mean gone through plenty of them. They leave me with the feeling of being ripped off since Id find them non-operable after a year or so. Plus, the inventors who invented them are raking in the money.  If the Clarisonic products are not breaking, you have to refill the heads of brush bristles on a regular basis. Ive also tried some cheaper, fake knockoffs of Clarisonic models, but found those to be just another frivolous waste of money.  A couple years ago, I discovered a much more frugal alternative, the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SOLO-Mio-Sonic-Face-Cleanser-and-Massager-Brush/dp/B00OYZKBVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SOLO Mio Sonic Face Cleanser and Massager Brush</a>, and found it to be an effective face cleaning instrument.  Recently, Ive had the opportunity to try Foreo Luna Face Exfoliator Brush and Silicone Cleansing Device for Combination Skin, and, though its pricier than SOLO, the device is larger, and it has the added anti-aging feature, which at my age is more of a necessity than a perk!  Anyway, I use the Foreo device twice a day, morning and night, and I find it gives my pores a deep-down good cleaning. Though the device cleans thoroughly, one problem Im experiencing, however, is that the unit does not keep its charge for prolonged periods and seems to run out of power prematurely before it is charged again. Apart from the charging dilemma, I can feel the difference on my skin. Foreo leaves my skin super soft and smooth, especially after I rinse the cleaner off my face, dry and apply moisturizer with the Foreo. Though its not as delectable as a professional facial, it feels gentle and nurturing on my face, and I certainly feel proactive trying to combat the aging process!  I haven't registered my Foreo, but hope I don't encounter the same problems other reviewers have had with Fake Foreos!  3.5 Stars due to my charging challenges	1
Completely waterproof for use in the bath or shower and with 2 speeds, Each full charge lasts up to 300 minutes. It's fun, but is it $99 fun?  the shape and color reminded me of my mother's birth control compact from the early 1970's LOL!  I use it for one minute in the shower in the morning and again about 12 hours later. I feel nice a refreshed and my skin has never been better. It basically forces you to take better care of your skin. weighes 3.36 ounces and is about 3 inches in height and width.	1
This is one intriguing face brush.  I've never seen anything like it.  It has two speeds, three different texture surfaces, and just a couple of minutes of usage leaves your face really clean.  (After 3 minutes, it turns off if still on, so you don't overuse it.)  It has caused no irritation to my face, either, and doesn't leave it dried out.  Since it was winter, I was certainly concerned about that.  I've only been using it once a day, however, and am using&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Garnier-SkinActive-Cream-Face-Wash-with-Aloe-Juice-Dry-Skin-5-75-fl-oz/dp/B073QPYJWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Garnier SkinActive Cream Face Wash with Aloe Juice, Dry Skin,  5.75 fl. oz.</a>&nbsp;with it, instead of a bar facial soap.  This Foreo Luna Mini comes in five colors, has a lithium ion battery, and comes with a recharge cable that only has a USB plug on the end.	1
My wife has been using this as a tool to clean her face but wouldn't tell me how good it is other than she loved it. So I borrowed it for the sake of resarch in order to see if this would work as a good facial cleaner. My face takes a beating from being outdoors in the winter and swimming, so short of bathing in skin cream I wanted to give this a try. It's an odd feeling to put this on my face, but I just moved this around on low setting after I wash my face and after a few days I felt it "less rough" (I'm a guy - I don't know how to describe these things) and less weathered.  For the price, I'm not sure if I'd buy it, but if your spouse buys it, feel free to steal it from time to time to clean your face. It's pretty awesome.	1
I would highly recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin who is looking for something to help clean their face! I have been looking into the FOREO Luna for a while and then I got the chance to review this product and buy it at a discount and I couldn't pass up the chance to review something so amazing.  I have sensitive dry skin and used this with my normal face cleanser at night last night and again this morning and I can already see such a difference in my skin. There is no dry flakes on my face and my moisturizer seems to be more effective as well.  I also use a clarisonic mia fit and prefer to go every other day between the two. The battery lasted about a month and to be honest that is so amazing- only to have to charge once a month really helps to keep using it every day.	1
Ive said it before, and Ill say it again. Ive gone through my share of expensive Clarisonic products for skin cleansing, and I mean, gone through plenty of them, and they leave me with the feeling of being ripped off since Id find them non-operable after a year or so. Plus, the inventors who invented them are raking in the money. If they're not breaking, you have to refill the heads of brush bristles. Ive also tried some cheaper fake knockoff models of Clarisonic, but found those to be just another frivolous waste of money.  A couple of years ago, I discovered a much more frugal alternative, the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SOLO-Mio-Sonic-Face-Cleanser-and-Massager-Brush/dp/B00OYZKBVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SOLO Mio Sonic Face Cleanser and Massager Brush</a>&nbsp;and found it to be an effective face cleaning instrument.  Recently, Ive had the opportunity to try&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/FOREO-LUNA-Face-Exfoliator-Brush-and-Silicone-Cleansing-Device-for-Sensitive-Normal-Skin-Pink/dp/B00CYHM7NU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">FOREO LUNA Face Exfoliator Brush and Silicone Cleansing Device for Sensitive/Normal Skin, Pink</a>, and though its pricier than SOLO, it is larger, and the device has the added anti-aging feature, which at my age is more of a necessity than a perk!  I also ordered the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/FOREO-LUNA-mini-Silicone-Face-Brush-with-Facial-Cleansing-for-All-Skin-Types-Petal-Pink/dp/B00CYHM3Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">FOREO LUNA mini Silicone Face Brush with Facial Cleansing for All Skin Types, Petal Pink</a>&nbsp;, and found it to be perfect for my daughter who needs a gentle but thorough cleaning for her sensitive skin, which, on occasion, has acne breakouts. She uses it once in the morning and once at night and loves how it cleans deep into her pores and removes impurities without leaving her skin dry. I can definitely see the difference on my daughters face. Her face appears much smoother and softer.  Ive had some charging issues with my with my Foreo product and found the device doesnt hold its charge. However, we have not found this to be the case with the FOREO LUNA mini Silicone Face Brush. We find the device holds its charge well.	1
This silicone face brush is a cleaning tool and massager in one. As I use it with my cleanser to thoroughly clean my face, the massaging action stimulates the blood to my skin, making it healthier. In addition, it exfoliates my skin, uncovering a fresher more vibrant layer below. The subtle vibration of the softly-dotted silicone surface cleans the face, making the skin feel alive. There is a variety of textures on this palm-sized brush, making it even more versatile. The silicone surface does not bacteria. It is very quiet and easy to clean. One charge last a long time. I have been using mine for well over a week, and I have never even charged it once. It comes already charged.  I was given a free brush in exchange for an unbiased review.	1
This feels simply wonderful when using it. Compact and easy to hold. Made my face feel very soft and clean, I could tell that it whisked away all of the dead skin and after just one use there was a huge difference in how I felt and looked.  Non-irritating and easy to use. Easy to charge and holds a charge well. No negatives at all. I love it.	1
Excellent	1
Once I got into the whole gel nail polish thing I needed the nail polish remover to go along with it. The thing I love most about this nail polish remover is that it does not have that strong acetone smell. It smells wonderful and works amazingly!	1
My husband gave this to me and I love it.  Bottle is very attractive and it contains a good amount of perfume that should last a long time. The smell is subtle but sweet and kind of floral.  I'm not a usual perfume wearer as the stronger scents make me sneeze but this is just subtle enough for me to enjoy without feeling queasy.  Really love it.	1
this is a great new perfume.  I wasn't really aware of it before, and I'm so happy with it that I'll be buying more when I run out.  The perfume has a very nice scent.  Its strong enough that people can tell without being overbearing.  It even lasts most of the day, which I was really surprised about.  This bottle was quickly highjacked by my 16 year old who developed a liking for it.  She told me it mixes very well with her natural aroma and that she felt comfortable using it for any occasion.  clearly its appreciated by the younger generation.  i could have told you that it wasn't an old lady smell but I felt that her adoption of it would be more telling.  I think it is a great gift item and I will buy some for my niece based on how popular its been in my house.  I'm really happy with it.	1
When I received this I was a little undecided... felt a little heavy (woody scent) but when my husband came home, he LOVED it!! He kept commenting on it and asking where I got it. Asked me to wear it again on our next date night. Score!!	1
You can tell by looking at the bottle that this is an expensive perfume. It's really pretty and looks like something you would see on a neatly displayed dressing table. The scent is nice, floral and sweet. The scent is strong on first spray, so use sparingly until you decide what amount is right for you.	1
I'd never heard of this perfume before but it smells so nice! Caution though it's not super long lasting but you will smell fresh the rest of the day. A good blind buy.	1
Perfumes are very subjective and it's hard to find one that fits. This has lovely floral notes and not too overpowering. The best thing is that it really lasts all day. Personally for me it's a little too 'sweet'. I gave it to my mom and she really liked it.	1
My wife loves this perfume.  She was worried when she saw sandalwood in the ingredient list, thinking it would be a heavy scent.  It is far from that. It goes on with a sweet and salty smell.  On drydown it turns into a lovely floral smell.  It opens into a fruit, light, and transparent scents.  She said it is one of her favorite summer scents now.  Her usual perfume is Givency Very Irresistible and Issey Miyake L'eau D'issey Pure for frames of reference.  The bottle is very classy looking as well.	1
After using it now for a few weeks, I've decided that I really like this hair dryer.  It took a little getting used to and certainly could use some clearer instructions from the "start", (as it took me a few minutes to figure out how to make it go), but it has a nice selection of heat and blower speeds (5 each), attachments, and my hair turns out soft, shiny, and lovely.  I especially like the no heat option button that you don't have to hold constantly as well as the extra long power cord.  The annoying thing to me is the huge warning label on the power cord to not leave it plugged in.  It also states you are not remove it but I believe it's days are numbered with me.  I feel more attention could have been given to operating instructions than the investment in this label, but that's just my opinion.  It's a bit heavier than most of my other dryers but not excessively so.  Hopefully, that means it's made better and will last a long time.  Considering the cost, I expect it to operate problem free for years, especially with the light use it will get in our household.  I will update my review if I have any issues as time passes but I love this hair dryer so far.	1
So far, a pretty good dryer. The cord is long but it's not professional quality like the Harry Josh that I own. The controls are a bit odd - too many heat choices, but easy enough to figure out once you find what works. Not a lot of info on the motorspeed but at 2100 w, it will dry quickly, which is the point of a good blowdryer. Love the cool blast button for professional styling.	1
I am in love with this blow dryer!  It is FANTASTIC!  It is a bit pricey but it works so good and I am hoping it will last a lifetime.  I won't lie, I couldn't figure out how to turn it on at first and had to read the instructions (press and hold the "reduce fan" button for two seconds).  Other than that though I have had no issues.  There are five different heating and five different fan settings to go from cold to really hot.  The highest setting dries hair very fast but over time would cause the most damage to hair so I would recommend only using this highest setting when you are short on time.  I personally prefer to use it on a medium setting and that dries faster than my old hair dryer did.  The cord is crazy long at around 7 feet, which is really nice as it never gets in the way.  The blow dryer comes with three different attachments and a handy drawstring bag to store it all in.  Bottom line, this is a very nice high quality blow dryer that I would recommend to anyone.	1
What a great perfume for an affordable price.  It's a bit different--more floral-- than my wife typically uses, but I can't help but say I was delighted when she finally decided to try it out.  The scent really blended well with the other products she uses, and softened quite a bit as she wore it.  I'm a huge fan of it, and am glad she got it.	1
This is an absolutely lovely fragrance. The floral and sandalwood notes are easiest to pick up on, and they blend together nicely for a inoffensive scent that should do well year 'round without feeling too light in winter or too cloying in summer. This is a great fragrance for business use as it doesn't project far from the wearer if they don't bathe in it. It is a pleasing scent that most anyone of any age should be able to enjoy.	1
The scent is too strong and gives me a headache.  It is floral in the core aroma with touch of citrus and fruity, but it's so rich and penetrating it overpowers everything else.  If you want something to make a statement, this would do it.  But if you like a lighter side, this would probably be too heavy.	-1
Essenza di Roma is a very heavy scent. It reminds me to a great extent of the Eternity perfume. Both of these are what my coworker calls elevator chokers - meaning, if you have someone wearing this first thing in the morning and they get on a crowded elevator, the scent engulfs and overpowers everyone around them.  I sprayed a short spritz on my wrist and neck, let it dry and then put on a turtleneck, which, when I smelled it the next day, it still smelled as strong as it did the day before. Frankly one of my favorite scents is almond based which this one says, it has "Layers of vanilla and almond'. I could discern no trace of that, instead it is a musky fragrance - nice for people who like that, but I certainly hope no one sits beside me in a theater or restaurant wearing this - it's just too strong.	-1
My wife and daughter both love this scent. My teen daughter says it smells like cherry blossoms. To me it seems like  a sharply sweet smell with a hint of vanilla.  It's a versatile scent that can be worn just about anywhere. It's a little on the heavy side, so it's more of a cold weather scent to me. I don't think it would play nicely with high heat and humidity but I could be wrong. I have to wait at least three more months to find out.  The heaviness is why I'm not a fan of the scent when my wife first sprays it on (too strong and generic smelling initially). However, after it has had a chance to settle in and mix with her body chemistry, it actually smells quite nice. I even find myself enjoying the subtle lingering aroma that she leaves behind right after she walks away. It's a good scent but my wife has other scents that really blow me away. I'd personally rate this three stars but she and my daughter really like it. It's a women's perfume, so the women's opinions outweigh mine.	1
This if fabulous!! Nice lift and soft hold.	1
One of the major problems I tend to have with make up bags is that there is never enough room.  I don't use a huge number of products (I don't require a train case or anything), but I do like enough room for my brushes,my makeup, and my moisturizers.  This bag is big enough to carry all of my necessary products and it is stylish enough that I don't need to bury it in a bigger bag.	1
This is a very pretty, high quality item. The leather is on the thinner side, very soft, and extremely supple. The color is a little more subtle in person, which as far as I'm concerned is a good thing.  It's a little small. It looks larger when you first take it out, but it doesn't stretch or distend very well, which leaves limited space. That said, you could fit a small eyeshadow pallet, mascara, lipstick, balm, etc. It's a good little bag if you're only taking essentials (I can never just take the essentials, I have to pack in as much as possible.)  Despite the high quality leather, I don't know if it's necessary worth the price. I'd qualify it as a luxury item. It is quite beautiful and well-made, though.	1
I don't believe I have seen a makeup bag that has been constructed this beautifully before receiving the Jouer Ooh La La Pink "IT" bag.  The leather is  high quality, flexible and has a metal zipper - a sure sign of quality over mass construction.  I found myself not wanting to risk putting makeup in the bag at all - for fear that something might spill inside and mar how gorgeous it truly is.  This would make a lovely gift for yourself or for someone special with a real eye for quality	1
This is a lovely bag. They clearly put a lot of attention into how it's put together, and little touches like the Jouer name on the zipper pull. The color is feminine without being too extreme, and the shape is just unusual enough to be interesting without being bizarre.  The leather itself is quite thin, which makes it very flexible and lovely, but also not exactly something I'd want to toss into a gym bag. Then again, this seems like the kind of thing that's designed to keep your most precious and expensive cosmetics safely together so that you can grab them all at once quite easily and they don't look like a mess on your vanity. It doesn't really strike me as something that was designed with the idea that it would be going through anything that called for a particularly rugged bag.  It is large enough and pretty enough that I could see it serving as a handbag in a pinch, but that's not something I'd buy it for as a primary use. The leather is thin and flexible enough that it'd be easy for it to end up looking lumpy and a bit sloppy if you weren't very careful with what you packed.	1
Ooh la la bag is a very nice soft leather bag.  Yes, it's very pink. Looks to be of high quality and will hold quite a bit. It also feels nice and soft.  It's a great bag to carry alone or as a makeup bag and throw it into a bigger bag.  Either way the "IT" bag is a must have to take on the journey.  I love it!  Marilyn	1
This is a very pretty, subtle bag.  I don't think it is probably very resilient, I think it will mark easily (dreading the first ballpoint pen "whoops"), but for "something special," it definitely makes the grade.  I tend to carry narrow bags these days, ones without center dividers of any sort, and this bag is perfect to fit in that type of purse because, without gussets or a "bottom," it doesn't expand much to the side, leaving lots of room for my Kindle.	1
This is such a gorgeous, elegant makeup bag. I love touching it. The leather is soft and supple. It is well designed and the color is a subtle pink . It can almost double as a clutch (except for the "ooh la la" in light gold on the outside).  I stored everything from my old makeup bag into this one and added some more just to see how much I can put in it and still have it zip up: 2 eyebrow pencils, 2 eyeliners, 3 concealers, small mineral powder, small sunscreen, 2 lip balm sticks, compact mirror, small comb, allergy pills, tissue packet, 2 lip glosses, 2 lipliners, blush, 1 blush brush, 1 concealer brush, Listerine pocket strips, allergy eyedrops.  And I have room for more. The bag isn't as bulky when filled as you would think. It lies flatter than my other bag because of its shape and fits much better in my purse.  My one caveat is that because it is such a high quality material and expensive, that I am afraid of what to do about stains. I have never had a makeup bag that did not pick up an errant lipstick or blush or pencil stain at some point and I would hate for this beautiful bag to get dirty. I think I will have to scotch guard the inside and outside just to make sure it remains beautiful.	1
What a weird container. After using it a few weeks I don't mind it so much anymore but I do wonder why they made it this way. I love the color and the matte feel of it. My skin is not the fairest but it still looks bonzed and pretty with this product. I'm the type of person who gets shinny skin in no time. This does not completely control it but I must say it will shine-less longer. Also, my skin tends to brake out with some makeup so I'm always wary of new products, but it was fine with this one. Overall, I really like it. It does not come with a brush to apply it so make sure you have one.	1
I usually avoid bronzing products....when you are as pasty as I am they just don't look good. Or they are too 'sparkly' or have too much shine to them. Like I need more glitz on my face!  This bronzer is the least orange and most neutral i found, of their available color selection. IF you are set on Jouer powder bronzer and you are pale, you may as well get this one. IT IS MATTE, delightfully so, it only deposits color and NOTHING ELSE! What a relief. I have very pink-toned skin and this did not make me look more pink. You'll want a nice brush for this though. I used several Real Techniques brushes and they all worked great.  Very big color payoff so start light, blow on the brush, and then apply. You use so little, this will last you forever	1
I did not expect to like this bronzer as much as I do. It is a nice, soft tan color that is not too dark or orange for my medium complexion. It adds a nice sun kissed glow to my complexion without looking too caked on and fake as many other bronzers do. I also love that this provides a matte finish - something that is hard to find in a bronzer. As others have noted, there is no brush included with the compact, which itself is a bit perplexing to understand until you realize it is designed to interlock with other products in this line. While the packaging design could be better, the product itself - a silky powder that goes on smoothly and without caking - definitely deserves five stars.	1
Just by chance the shade they sent goes with my natural skin color.  After using tinted sunscreen/moisturizer or foundation, skin tones are even but not quite natural looking (I'm not crazy about the porcelain doll look even if the sun spots are gone) A whiff of this makes me look more like myself. For newbies to this product line, each compact comes with a mirror, and there is a sliding lock on the sides that lets you join different  products into a palate of colors.  It does not come with a brush.  The compact and the product seem very sturdy and high quality.  I've been lucky with colors (this was a Vine product and they just send what they send) but don't think I would purchase something like this without being able to try it.  That is the only reason for one star off.	1
I use this almost daily with the Jouer "moisturizing tint" in golden. It provides a deep, rich bronze with minimal effort and lasts all day.  I think that the packaging was a bit interesting, until you realize that it is designed to fit in with other products in the same line.  It was a bit smaller then I anticipated, but given how far a little bit goes - I would not consider this a problem.  The Jouer tint + matte bronzer have become two of my daily go-to's for a natural, easy look - I have a feeling this may be my new favorite line.  Highly recommend!	1
This is a great "nude" shade, although it runs a little "lavender."  Looks great on toes.	1
Love the color. Has a bit of a brown undertone to it, but it goes well with most grays.  Essie is a thicker polish, some of the darker colors will need 2 coats, but 2 coats is always best for a glossy finish. I type a lot and do hand work so it's nice to have a great color that lasts at least a week before looking like I've put my nails in the wood chipper!	1
Perfect color for the holidays!	1
This is a pretty muted purple/pink with an iridescent purple running through it. It has great dimension and the wear time is exceptional - however you will need at least 3 coats for it to be opaque.	1
Essie Cartel blue is a deep, rich navy blue. It's perfect for any time of the year.	1
Pretty color, but not as opaque as I'd hoped. Even with 3 coats, the white of my nails is visible.	1
Love this color and love Essie products.  I have long natural nails and Essie is my favorite reasonably priced polish for natural nails.	1
Love this color.	1
This nail polish is the best! Yes, it is kind of expensive, but it does last and the colors are always fresh and beautiful.	1
I don't ever expect these kinds of products to work, but they're fun to try. This one surprised me though. I have some crepey skin above one eyelid, and after using this for about a week, it definitely began to look plumper and smoother. (!!)  It's just a temporary effect, though. When I was unable to use the product for a while, the old appearance came back. So it's going to be an ongoing investment to enjoy the results. But at least there are results to enjoy!  The tube does seem to be lasting for a long time, at least, even though it's pretty expensive.	1
I am always unsure about ordering retinol.  I have extremely sensitive skin.  This cream did not bother me at all!  It takes just a small amount dabbed around the eyes.  I use it only at night.  It is impossible to say if it will be effective without more time.  I like the way it feels after I rub it in.  No fragrances, either!  Tube is small but should last quite awhile.  I'm hoping to get rid of some milia and dark spots around my eyes.  Retinol is supposed to be good for that.	1
I actually like this eye cream, and I usually don't like any. No burn, is pretty thick, little goes a long way. I am half way through it, so cant say its the bomb, as in the best ever. But can say it does not stink, does not irritate, and may help in the long run. The ingredients are spot on, application is easy. I am liking it.	1
I'm a big StriVectin lover, so not surprisingly I love this  ~ I usually use a soothing eye gel under my eyes in the daytime before I put my make up on.  I work midnights, so I am ALWAYS sleep deprived, always have dark circles and some puffiness going on....but I've been using this for about 10 days and I'm very pleased with the instant results as well as the fact that I'm pretty sure I'm seeing some of my fine lines around my eyes smooth out.  It instantly soothes under my eyes and after about a min. my dark circles and puffiness go away...it gives my skin a cool hydrated feeling I love that stays with me for a while, and smooth finish for my make up application.  Great product!	1
Being a woman of a certain age, I have tried many, many under-eye creams that are supposed to help reduce the signs of aging. Very few, if any deliver on this 'promise'. StriVectin- AR Advanced Retinol Eye Cream is one of those eye creams that delivers!  You only need a little bit. Moisturize with your chosen overall day or night moisturizer then take a small dab and dab under your eye area with your ring finger for the lightest pressure in this very fragile part of your skin. you will notice results almost immediately! I was very pleasantly surprised! This one is definitely a keeper!	1
I wish I loved this cream--it's a little bit on the greasy side, and has an off-putting (to me)artificial fragrance I've smelled in other creams before--and I can't handle the smell, although my husband is ok with it. I don't like the way it feels on my skin enough to overcome the fragrance. It just doesn't smell pleasant to me. It's beautifully packaged, but I can't get past the smell of it. If this is a cedar smell, I don't like it. I'd love it if it was more of  an orange/citrus smell, or orange blossom, but it is most definitely neither of those. And honestly, I don't get a cedar fragrance either--more of a generic artificial perfume.	-1
Happy Buddha Body Cream  I love the warm spicy orange scent! My husband said, ooh, the smells nice. This cream is very thick, about the consistency of thick greek yogurt. It goes on smooth and absorbs well.	1
High quality tint. A little bit goes a long way.	1
This is my favorite CND Shade (Dark Dahlia) It's a dark plum-black. I tend to favor the red shades (Rouge Rite and Wildfire are my favorite Reds) and this is nice if I want to take my nails short and do a vampy thing. It also makes glitter, additives and foil just pop, if you're into that.	1
This eyeliner goes on incredibly smooth and there really is no tugging which can cause eye wrinkles long term. It glides on and it makes an incredibly sharp line and it's very black. I only have to make one swipe and it's a perfect line everytime. Sometimes I do use small strokes if my hand is unsteady but this is one of the few eyeliners that I can smoothly make one stroke with.  It's pretty budge proof and it stays on all day! There's no smudging or marks left around the eyes. The color and smoothness cannot be beat and it stays on all day and night!	1
Decent gel type eyeliner pencil which works similarly to other mid-priced versions. Doesn't smudge easily and has decent water resitance.	1
I got this for my wife, who declared it perfectly fine for a gel eyeliner pencil. It went on smooth, and lasted the entire day when she used it. Nice color and thickness. No irritation or smudging, and no complaints at all!	1
I am very pleased with this Laura Geller New York Eyeliner Pencil. With proper prepping it lasts all day and stays put. I appreciate the self sharpener that comes with it. The sparkle is attractive and eye catching but not overstated.  It goes on smooth without tugging and looks fantastic. It isn't easy to remove except with makeup remover but it is so worth it.	1
So far so good	1
This Pro-definition facial oil works well - it does not have the watery feeling of some other brands, and will not slide down that easy off your face. The scent is OK and it leads me to believe it is a lavender mix - nothing out of the ordinary. I have now used it for a few weeks and the facial skin feels better and tighter than before. Pricey but will last a long time since only a few drops are used at one time.	1
This product says to massage 3-4 drops into the face and neck.  This oil leaves my skin silky smooth.  I have not noticed any improvement of saggy skin or lines as this product claims to do but it certainly feels nice enough to keep using.  Unless there was is obvious improvement the price would keep me from purchasing again, but it does feel very nice.	1
This oil transformed my wife's skin:  At night, it provided serious moisture and during the day, provided a great pre-makeup primer.  You only need a couple of drops (dont waste it  its a little pricey), but your skin will thank you.  It does have an aroma, but it is lovely: fresh, botanical and not overwhelming.  It states its for mature skin, but I think any skin could benefit from it. You will LOVE this!	1
I was really surprised by this oil. I had imagined that it would be like baby oil and leave my face feeling uncomfortably greasy. Nope. It is quite oily when you use the dropper to put drops of the oil in your hand before applying it, but once on my face it is absorbed quickly leaving it feeling soft.  It dose a much better job of giving me a more youthful look and glow than any of my face creams for mature skin. And a little goes a long way. 4 or 5 drops covers my face and neck.  The fragrance is a lovely botanical scent. The scent is light and doesn't linger so no worries about clashes with the fragrances of other toiletries or perfume.	1
I have dry skin and am constantly trying to find moisturizers that will not clog my pores and keep me hydrated.  I like the scent of this oil and so far it does not appear to clog my skin but sometimes I find it a little heavy.  It could be because it is still summer and not the winter when I feel especially dry that I found myself using this sparingly or not at all.  I think this facial oil is probably too heavy if you have oily skin or if the weather is hot and humid.  It is probably a great protector if you live in an arid environment or if it is winter.  It does seem to smooth the skin out but because it is an oil  you may want to let it absorb a bit (or not using it) before applying top layers of makeup as they may come off.  I think this facial oil is best during dry times and for use at night before bed.	1
Not only did this product do absolutely nothing, it seemed to aggravate my face by generating darkened spots of pigmentation that lasted for several minutes (in the pattern of the device head, a cluster of circles). I used it in the morning and evening and it took FOREVER because you have to hold the small surface-area head up to all your affected areas for a few minutes at a time, which means it took me at least 15 minutes to treat my acne each session. Not worth the purchase. Try something different, this product is a gimmick.	-1
SMELLS GREAT LASTS LONG.	1
The ease of application, the lovely color and from a brand I like made me immediately like this eyeshadow crayon. That changed in about 10 minuets, when I looked in a mirror and saw my eyes were a raccooned mess. Nothing I did or used, moisturized, primers, dry, could get this eye crayon to stay on my lid without smudging, shifting and all but disappearing, except for a greasy mess in my crease. I have very normal eye lids, I have always enjoyed exceptionally long wear time for almost all my eye makeup, so this is a serious surprise and disappointment. I would not recommend, or repurchase.	-1
My son's facial hair grows rapidly and so he often needs to shave twice a day.  His face is a little tender after shaving and the liquid aftershave he was using kind of stung.  He had tried another lotion sometime in the past and it felt better than the liquid.  I love the different Burberry scents and thought this aftershave balm might work well for him, and I was right.  He loves it, and his girlfriend loves the scent.  It is masculine, but not in an "in your face" way.  He says it leaves his skin smooth and doesn't sting.	1
I generally like Burberry fragrances, both the ones marketed for men as well as those marketed towards women. It was with high expectations I looked forward to trying out the Brit Rhythm aftershave balm. As for the fragrance, well, it is a clean, inoffensive scent, that is, it smells very nice, but it is completely forgettable. There is nothing that really stands out about the fragrance at all. This is not a bad thing like one might assume, however, as there are many times when this type of scent is preferred over anything else.  As for the properties of the balm itself, I am extremely happy with its performance. It is a nice consistency that is neither too thin nor too thick. It smooths into the skin readily, leaving it feeling soft and moisturized. There is no greasy feeling with this balm. It does a good job of soothing razor burn without stinging or burning upon application.  So my verdict? Use it for the excellent aftershave balm that it is. It is a good inoffensive fragrance for those who work in close quarters with others. It is least likely to cause others to wrinkle their noses in disgust.	1
I'm already a Burberry fan. My favorite men's cologne is Burberry London -- a French-made, manly parfum ("perfume"). Now I'm a fan of "Brit Rhythm," which is also a cologne, but I've only tried the after shave.  When you first open the plastic bottle, be a little careful. I was holding it a little too hard in my meathooks, I guess, and a blurb ran down the side. In general, I find the bottle's "squeezability" a plus, as it helps to get the right amount on your fingertips to apply to your face.  If you're giving this as a gift, once again, Burberry does a fine job of presentation. The box is embossed black, with silver foil printing, including a graphic representation of the textured bottle within, and it makes a stylish first impression.  By contrast, the bottle inside is white, as is the balm. It's not as fancy as the Burberry men's and women's cologne/perfume, which come in glass. The after shave bottle is plastic, as I said. But it is attractive, textured with the classic Burberry check pattern. It has a silver square top, reminiscent of the London cologne.  As for the scent, it is impossible to top Burberry's own description: "An energizing aftershave balm [with] top notes of basil verveina and cardamom...black leather and patchouli and sensual base notes of cedarwood and incense." Wow, sounds wonderful. (Again, as with the cologne, I was a little nervous about patchouli -- the Hippie favorite of the 60s. But it is well blended, and nearly impossible to detect).  As for the "skin soothing part," that includes "bisabolol," which I had to look up. Turns out, that's the oil in chamomile, and has been known to perfumers for centuries as a skin-healing and soothing agent. Modern researchers have found it to be an anti-irritant, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial -- all good things for your poor razor-ravaged skin!  By the way, this goes very well with Burberry's "London" men's cologne, something you have to consider when you're applying more than one fragrance.  Recommended!	1
This was a nice item for the shower. It lathers nicely and gives off a fruity scent. I wish it was a little bigger, especially for the price, but I liked the way I felt clean after using it. While I would recommend it for your guy, you might consider the size before making the purchase. But it is nice!	1
My husband uses this in the shower and he loves it. Great scent and lathers well. I would buy this again, especially as a gift for special occasions.	1
Cardamom, black leather, basil and cedarwood? Yes please! I gave this to my boyfriend but even I steal it sometimes in the shower, this stuff smells intense, very very fresh and aggressively refreshing. Be prepared to smell crisp and powerfully clean all day.  Burberry makes some of the best fragrances in the world, I've worn some through the years and this body wash is truly an experience. The bottle is gorgeous as well, it looks like cologne in my shower, the textured bottle is gorgeous and the silver cap just tops it off. Lovely and very delicious, highly recommended.	1
When we first got it we were a little confused on how to use. Is it a body wash or an after body wash wash??? Hubby put it to the test by using it as a body wash and then as a wash after his real body wash. He figured out that it is a wash for after using his regular body wash. We would have found it really helpful if it came with instructions on how to use.  Hubby really likes the way it feels on his skin and the smell that is being left behind. He said it was very easy to apply, wash off, and that the smell was not overpowering. In fact hubby uses both Old Spice body wash & deodorant and he feels like this Burberry smell fits really well with his Old Spice.  The only true complaint (other than directions) is the price. $35 is a lot of money for an after shower wash. If the price was cut in half I feel like hubby would have no problem paying for this extra smell but at a cost of $35 it is just too expensive.	1
I chose this for my monthly Julep beauty box in August.  I am always on the lookout for the next great mattifying primer.  I have combination skin with an oily t-zone and even with thick, heavy coverage foundation, proper moisturization, and finishing powder, I need blotting papers by noon.  Well.  I had high hopes when I applied this.  It didn't look like a traditional mattifying primer, but it went on like one.  (It is a white, gel-like substance.  Primer does not always have color -- this one doesn't -- because it is meant to go on under foundation.)  It did provide a good base for my foundation, or so I thought.  The first thing that went wrong is that, by noon, my face was completely shiny.  So basically this didn't mattify at all.  This really made my makeup not look good and by the end of the day, the look I had worked to create that morning was basically disintegrating.  (With a good primer, my makeup will last all day, from about 8 AM to 6 PM.  With *this* primer, it lasted from maybe 8  AM to noon, if that.)  Before I gave it a poor rating, though, I wanted to see if this broke me out.  Because I don't like to throw out full-sized beauty products, I thought maybe I could use this on weekends or something, when I am just going out to dinner and then going home, and the makeup will only be on for a few hours.  However, what I found was that, after a week or so of use, I had a terrible, terrible breakout.  I had not changed anything else about my skincare routine at the time, so I think this primer is to blame.  In sum: this didn't help my makeup last, it didn't actually mattify, and it made me break out.  I am going to have to throw it out.  (For reference, if you are looking for a mattifying primer in the same tier as this product, Benefit POREFessional, Smashbox Photo Finish Pore Minimizing, and Dermalogica Hydrablur are worth looking at, though I find Paula's Choice Shine Stopper the best of all.  The Urban Decay De-Slick primer broke me out horribly, though it did control shine.)  I still love Julep nail polishes, but this stuff just didn't work for me at all.	-1
I've been using this product for several weeks now.  I am happy with the product for the most part.  It does seem to make my makeup smoother with one exception.  By the end of the day, the makeup on my nose becomes splotchy.  Maybe because there is more oil there?  Not sure.  Other than that, the rest of my skin looks great.  Also, just FYI, I was expecting a cream type of texture but this is more like a gel.  I'm thinking this is why the pores appear smaller because my face feels tighter after the gel dries.	1
I love the product. I have been using it for 2 months. The product is expensive but I think it's worth it.	1

I really like the feel of this sunscreen when applying to my skin. It absorbs well and is easy to spread. It also provided good protection at ball games, the water park, and for every day outdoor activities.  I did leave this in the car overnight, and the end of the tube leaked (where it is sealed, not at the opening), leaving a bit of a mess in the car. I typically leave tubes of sunscreen in the car so that we are never without, but have never had this problem before. Temperatures were well over 110 that week, so that may have been a contributing factor, but my other brand of sunscreen did not leak. Still, I figure this was probably a fluke and would be willing to give this sunscreen another shot.	1
My wife tried two Obagi sunscreens: Obagis products are always winners, but I gave this one four stars because Im comparing it to their 360 Hydrafactor sunscreen, which I prefer.  The Nu-derm line is targeted towards middle-aged or older skin while the 360 line was created for younger skin (20s).  I typically prefer anything that is from the Nu-derm line with this exception.  Its a great product  don't get me wrong, but if Im going to pay the money, I want the 360 Hydrafactor.  It feels less thick yet more moisturizing.  Long story short:  really great product, but prefer the 360 Hydrafactor.	1
Started using this line after going to my dermatologist. She started me on it and for once my skin started clearing up and having very sensitive skin I never had this kind of gental skin with a skin care products. Then I stopped using to go to something natural. Coconut oil. Bad move I started breaking out and it only got worse. I started back using Obagi and the first was made my skin stop burning and could feel the gentleness just after washing my face and neck. I will never change again. I'm not sure how it makes such a difference in such a short period of time but it did. Please don't hesitate to buy because of the price it's so well worth it. I can't wait for the burning and breakout to stop and my skin to start feeling and looking clear again.	1
I have older sensitive skin that is sometimes prone to acne flare-ups due to weather and hormones. Obagi Nu-Derm Foaming Gel is the answer to the problem I have been having with finding the right skin cleanser. They are either too harsh, too oily, too drying, or have something in it my face doesn't like, however, I have not had that problem since I have been using Obagi. It is not only gentle on my skin, but doesn't leave it oily or dry, but leaves it feeling soft, clean and balanced. I've been very pleased with the long term results. My skin looks clean and healthy and even a bit younger to me. This is one cleanser that is going to be a staple in my skin care regime! Another plus - you don't need to use very much to clean your face, so the bottle goes a LONG way!	1
I love the product. I have been using it for 2 months. The product is expensive but I think it's worth it.	1
All of the items in this set are finely, and precisely made--maybe a little too precisely, as they're full of squared metal edges that feel a little unfriendly. But once you get used to it (and learn how to hold the snippers) it's fine.  Every tool works quite well. Their operation (other than the file) can be a little counter intuitive, but there are instructions... even if most guys won't bother to look. ;) Like another reviewer, I found the paper insert with the woman on it weird and tacky, but just like the instructions, the man I tested this kit on didn't even notice it. The carrying pouch is nice.  Other than the ridiculous price, I think this set is great. I don't see that it's worth over a hundred dollars. But maybe when it goes on sale, it'll be a good deal.	1
Color is perfect...long lasting good moisture.  This lipstick replaced a Chanel color they quit making...so was pleased to find this.	1
Love this serum! Use it every day & every night. Smooths out skin texture! Best ever!	1
I just used this product for couple days and right now area around eyes swelling, burning and red , some ingredient in the that cream I am allergic too. And I been used before other companies but never have like this allergic reaction ever.	-1
Lovely scent and soothing spray.  A bit spendy, but a product I can recommend as a luxury to enjoy with the added benefit of serving as scent.	1
Ive always loved the fragrance of roses and this rosewater spray is a nice moisturizer which is easy to use. I like that its natural, with rose oil, but doesnt smell overly strong. I spray it on my face and then lightly message it in. It absorbs reasonably quickly. I would say its moisturizing ability is about medium on my skin which is aging and tends to be dry these days. I have to use other moisturizers if I want my skin to feel totally moisturized, but this does a good job during the day and is also very nice over foundation on days when I wear it. It also feels good on my hands. I like that its natural.	1
This is the first time I ever used rosewater spray to soften my skin. I live in the north east, so I get dry skin every winter from the cold weather to the dry air in my house while using the heat. So when I first tried the rosewater spray, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it kept my skin soft. Now I still use a night cream on my face, and always use hand lotion as well, but this rosewater is a perfect addition to my regular routine, and it has a very soft pleasant smell to it, that isn't over powering. It makes the skin on my face feel a little tighter as well. I will continue to use this rosewater spray, I really like it more than I thought I would.	1
I'm just now learning about essential oils and really wish I had used this while on our winter vacation. We are from Florida and spent two weeks in the North Carolina mountains for Christmas. Our luck, they were have a record breaking cold spell and the temperatures got down to single digits.  I thought everyone was fine in our nice cozy rental home with great heat. Only to learn within days of going in and out, that everyone would suffer so much from dry skin.  Again, as a Floridian, I heard of people complaining about cracked, dry skin, but I didn't realize how bad it could get.  After reading numerous reviews, I see that many people use this Rose water to help with dry skin.  That's so amazing that you can actually use something natural to help. I do remember my grandmother would always spray a spritz of rosewater on her skin at night.  She always smelled so good and who knew that it was keeping her skin so soft?  So After returning home with the misery of dry skin, we tried the spray. It seems to work very well to moisturize and soften the skin.  It does have a very pleasant smell, one that takes me back to my childhood. When I first sprayed it, it feels very cool. After it dries,  I do notice that my skin feels soft.  The product literature recommends spraying your face each night before bed. I will continue this regimen to see if it actually helps.  While reading more uses for the spray, the company states that it is an anti inflammatory spray. It also states that it will help with nausea. Looks as if I need to do more research and experiments with my new hobby, essential oils. They seem to have such a variety of uses!	1
My cousin is an esthetician and recommends natural products - rosewater being one of them.  I use it to cleanse my face at night.  I feel like my skin is cleaner and smoother - it says it helps tone but haven't really seen the effects of that yet after about 3 weeks use.	1
Rosewater is something I associate with the Victorian era but it's made a big comeback in recent years. Rosewater is excellent for the skin because its chief ingredient, roses, contain antioxidants like Vitamin E which helps fight wrinkles. It's also good for soothing irritated or dry skin, especially in the winter. Though you can spray it directly on your face and hands, I prefer to apply it by spraying it onto a soft cotton pad and going over my face with it. The smell is lightly fragrant and very calming. Rosewater is a new product to me but I'm impressed by how pleasant the smell is and how it makes your skin feel.	1
This is wonderful to use when your skin is feeling dry or want to freshen up your face a bit.  You spray this on your face and let it absorb without wiping off.   It absorbs nicely into my skin and feels great. It is not a traditional "cleaner" like soap that you lather your face with and rinse off. So with that said, I would not say that my face feels "cleaner" after spraying this, but it does however leave my face very moisturized and smells amazing. I have used it under and over makeup, and both ways are wonderful.	1
I used this product twice a day for nearly a month.  In the morning to cleanse, and at night to moisturize after a deep clean.  After a while I noticed my pores had some pale clogs.  There is no information in the bottle about what is used as a base oil, and although there is a great deal said about the Damascus Rose essential oil, theses no info on if they use the true essential oil and what else they dilute it with.  I have Damascus Rose essential oil, its very expensive and is used sparingly in my own aroma therapy. This product neither smells nor acts like the true oil.  Its either very dilute with lots of other stuff, or they don't use the true oil, but a byproduct instead.  I don't recommend this	-1
This eyeliner is a bit different from from the pencil eyeliners. It's nice though. It's a bold gold color. It's great for a fall look if you combine it with beige, brown, and copper eye shadow. I felt like this eyeliner took my eyes up to the next level. I do not always wear it though, as it doesn't go with every look. Also, I did have to dip my brush into the pot multiple times to get all of my lash line complete.	1
This is a pretty good golden eyeliner.  I am not the best at applying eyeliner.  I tend to have problems with skipping and wavy lines.  This liner was actually quite easy to apply.  I used an eyeliner brush, and it swept on with no problems.  I did find that putting the liner on the brush was more of a production than I expected.  I dipped my brush in, but the texture of the liner meant that my brush seemed to resist it- it didn't pick up color like I hoped.  I ended up having to swirl my brush around in the product and really load it up.  I was afraid that this would lead to a mess on my eyes.  Thankfully it did not, but it is a bit annoying to get the product on your brush.  That said, this liner drew a fool-proof line on my eyes.  The color was lighter than I expected, which means that with one coat you can use this for daytime.  For evening I would build up multiple coats to get a more obvious flashy gold.  I would definitely recommend putting down an eye base before using this liner.  It is not waterproof, and it does tend to wear off.  Removal is easy with pretty much any cosmetic remover.  Also, this eyeliner did not irritate my eyes, which I appreciated, though I only used it on my top lid.  Overall, this is not a bad metallic liner.	1
I received the gold color. It is a good quality product that seems to have some lasting power. I like gel liner because it is more forgiving when applying than a liquid liner is.  The product is a thick mousse like texture and comes beautifully packaged. With the right brush, you can make your eyeliner as thick or thin as you want. I generally only wear black eyelener but the look with the gold color was a plesant surprise.  It does have a bit of a shimmer , which i do not prefer. But otherwise, it has a nice texture and very long lasting.	1
Beautiful, silky gel liner which gives your eyes the extra pop of shimmer on those special occasions. Glides on smoothly and lasts for hours. highly recommend this excellent product!	1
This is the second gel liner in a pot I've tried (with the first being Bobbi Brown's Long-Wear Gel Eye Liner).  And I've decided that eyeliner in this format is my absolute favorite.  I love that I can control how thick or thin the line is depending on the brush I use and I personally find it easier to create a steady line with a brush vs. a pencil or felt tip liner.  Even better this color is really gorgeous.  It's not something I would have picked out on my own because I gravitate towards black, plum, and dark brown, but once I actually tried it on I was smitten.  I've found that this gold compliments many of the neutral brown shadows I have really well, especially those with a bit of shimmer.  I've been using it with my Bobbi Brown Shimmering Sands palette and really loving the results.  I also find it wears really well.  It seems waterproof and doesn't smudge.  I'm impressed with how great it still looks at the end of a workday, even if I squeeze in a workout.  Would recommend!	1
I've never used a creme gel eye liner before, but I have to say that I love this!! I've also never used anything aside from black or dark brown liner and I was surprised by how much I liked this gold against my green eyes. And a secret? I am generally really horrible at applying liner (pencil or liquid) to my top lid, but it's so much easier with a creme gel liner since it's more blendable and easy to get right along the eyelash line. Plus, a little smudge looks good.  This also makes an awesome eyeshadow, but I think the gold is a little too blingy for my taste. Also, I have pretty oily skin and found that it didn't last as long as I would like it to. However, this is a problem I have with pretty much all creme gel eyeshadows, so nothing new here.  I will definitely continue to use  this as a liner for a more fun look than my usual!	1
This is a creamy gel eyeliner. It is almost too creamy for me, as my eyelids tend to get oily. Even after applying a great eye primer from Urban Decay, it still feels too creamy for my eyes and does not stay on too long. It is very spreadable though and can also be used as an eyeshadow.  I do like the formulation and the shade - it looks great on any skin tone.  It's a great gel to use for extra effect to make an eyeshadow pop, not just as an eyeliner. The best part about it being a gel eye creme is that it does not irritate the skin like some eyeshadows with glitter and achieves a more subtle and understated effect that I like. An added plus is that it does not shed or crease after application, super important for any eye product. So I am giving it 4 stars, despite the expensive price tag!	1
I was not familiar with Vincent Longo before I received this product, and I have to say that I am very pleased with the results.  A list of highlights: 1) great color 2) easy to apply 3) blends well 4) not heavy 5) long lasting 6) Nice price  I don't have any complaints about it. Its a great product!	1
This concealer goes on easily and lasts all day.  I use it under my eyes to hid some dark circles that I have inherited.  It is lightweight and doesn't "cake."  Fragrance free.	1
I had given up on concealers. The ones I tried were usually not thick enough to stay or they just looked bad. And I wasn't going to spend a lot of money on something that I wasn't sure would work.  I have a few acne scars, age spots, and other signs of getting older. There's not a lot to cover up, but there is one spot that I like to cover when I can. This product is a little too thick to use under my eyes because it makes me look like I'm wearing a lot of makeup.  I'm trying to go for a more natural look.  This isn't perfect, but it is the best concealer I've ever used.  I have to apply and blend to make the product cover without contrasting with my foundation. The coverage doesn't last through my day -- in and out of doors -- but at least I start the day looking great.  There is a lot of product in this tube so it should last a long time.	1
I had good luck with this bronze stick.  I thought it gave just the right amount of bronze so I could add some light contouring to my fair skin.  It was very creamy in consistency but not as fat/chunky as others (would have liked it a bit more chunkier) but that is just a personal preference. I have a fairly light skin tone (03 Urban Decay, Light Foundation IT cosmetics) and I thought this complemented my skin well.	1
I got the Bronze Corrector Stick and it glides on easily and required only a thin smoothing to help cover imperfections in my facial skin. I put just a thin layer on my hand, where I have light skin and dark age spots and I can visually see the difference just in the light covering. I have a pinkish skin tone and the Bronze has a yellowish tint. It feels satiny and I do like this corrector stick.	1
This is a small portion of concealer designed for spot coverage of blemishes, dark spots, or other skin imperfections. I will note that I tried it without foundation, but with a moisturizer applied to my skin to make application less difficult. My skin is thin, aging (I'm 53) and fairly sensitive (which is why I don't use foundation. My primary purpose in using this was to cover somewhat bluish dark spots under my eyes during allergy season.  I will note that my expectations of this product were high based on the price point. Since it markets itself as being good for sensitive skin, I didn't expect that it would make my skin itchy after application and intermittently thereafter (but the worst in the 10 minutes or so after application). Without foundation, I found that it was very difficult to blend it in in such a way that it wasn't obvious that there was a spot application of make-up under my eyes  at least if used in sufficient layers to actually provide some concealment. I guess the tone may not have been the best match for my skin color, but I'm not sure if any shade would have worked better. All in all, I was disappointed in the coverage and the feel.  Besides the difficulty blending and the itchiness, I was somewhat disconcerted by the packaging, but not by how basic and cheap it was for a high profile product (though there was that, too as it's just a black tube with a plain-ish label on it). I was uncomfortable with the lack of any sort of seals on it at all. The box has no seal. The tube itself has no seal. It would be very easy for someone to tamper with the make-up and there would be no way to know what had happened.	-1
My review is partially skewed because I ordered the wrong color. I have very fair skin so this Dermafinish Bronze Corrector Stick was way too dark for me. However, I can tell you that this product was easy to apply and went on smoothly. While I had to put it on lightly and blend it more than others who have this skin tone, it still did a great job covering old age spots and dark circles under my eyes and would most likely do so if I had my correct shade. It blended easily and had a creamy like smoothness when applying it. It stayed on all day and it did not cake up like other concealers or correction sticks do. After I applied the foundation, I could see the darker areas where I applied the correction stick but it would blend perfectly and offer a flawless complexion if the shades match. I highly recommend this product and all the Dermafinish products.	1
I saw the Bronze and groaned. Seemed too orange to me. But then I remembered that the Armani concealer is oranger than I expected too. So I tried it just at the eye's edge where it meets the nose, and then a teensy bit down into the dark circle that is my face.  It blends!  I didn't expect it to work this well.  I had used Touch Eclat for years, and this is definitely a different shade, but quite nice for looking perky.  Seems like it could last forever as I used so little. And it's very creamy so no creasing or cracking into the day.	1
Great exfoliater and cleanser.	1
was hoping for more granuals	1
Very good night time skin product	1
this is a good retinol complex especially if you are relativelynew to retinol nd are looking to combat the first signs of aging.  iused s directed aand found it easy and pleasant to apply. It did not sting or cause major redness likeother retinol lotions I'e used. tht being said it is very drying. I found using it twic a week was more than sufficient. I can't report anydramatic improvement but there was a subtle betterment. Skin looked refreshed in th reas I pplied it. Although the directions are to apply to the whole face I found just applying to the problem areas of fine lines worked better for me. Een when used with moisturizer it is drying.	1
This SkinMedica Retionol Complex is great!  Ive had several compliments on the appearance of my skin since I started using it.  But, I should have read the directions first!  It says use once or twice a week starting off.  I didnt!  I applied every night for several nights in a row.  As a result, my skin started pealing.  I realized my mistake after I read the directions.  But, the great news is that after my skin stopped pealing, it looked great!  I could definitely see a difference in my skin.  It looked so smooth and brighter!  I love this product and only use it 2 or 3 times a week now.  Highly recommend !	1
I know this 0.5 retinol cream has retinol in it because I feel a slight warming of my skin soon after applying it. But it just isn't strong enough to do for me what my prescription strength Retin-A used to do. The instructions say to use one pump, but that doesn't seem like enough so I use two. My skin is so accustomed to retinol that I did not experience even the slightest redness, peeling, or irritation. Nor did I experience the skin smoothing effects I've had from stronger creams. I see from other's reviews that they did receive some benefits, so I am going to make an educated guess that my skin is particularly challenging and needs a more concentrated formula than this SkinMedica product offers. I also want to reiterate that I always use sunscreen during the day even if I have no plans to spend much time outside because retinol creams make the skin so much more vulnerable to sun damage. One other comment: I see that one reviewer has supposedly helped at least 30 potential buyers with her review in which she notes "expiration dates" of 2014 and 2016. Unfortunately she is confused. The dates to which she refers are copyright dates and have nothing to do with expiration dates. It's an unfortunate misunderstanding that apparently has misled quite a few people.	1
My wife has been using Retinol type products at night for about a year and her skin is not easily irritated. So she was excited to try this product by SkinMedica. My wife hasn't really ever had any negative reaction to the SkinMedica Retinol or to similar products.  She likes many of the SkinMedica products because they seem well-formulated and effective on her skin type, mostly dry but not sensitive. She has been using it for about two months and her skin feels softer, less dry and tighter in most areas. She thinks her fine lines are looking better. Overall, she thinks this SkinMedica Retinol is worth the price!	1
I had used Retinol creams that I got from a dermatologist years ago and I remember it took me a while for my skin to get used to it. At first you might peel and get a little red, but over time (and gradual use, don't use every night at first) it can really help. The only reason I stopped is because I was going out in the sun too much and you really cant do that while you're using a Retinol cream.  I was interested in trying this because I love SkinMedica products and know of their stellar reputation. This cream does go on smoothly and it felt great. But the bad news is that I had an immediate bad reaction even though I was careful and barely used any.  I waited a few days before I tried again but it was only worse - what happened to me is that it made any broken blood vessles on my face redder than ever and made me look very flushed, almost as if I had Rosacea, which Ive never had before. I immediately stopped after that.  So I do think that this is very potent stuff, but that it can be very problematic for those of you who have sensitive skin like I  do and especially if you have any telangiectasia on your face.	1
I have not used retinol for a few years so I was careful to follow the directions about how to start using it.  Retinol is a pretty powerful product and I think it always pays to follow directions in this instance.  I felt like it made the tone and feeling of my skin better.  I did not notice any unusual redness.  There was a slight redness the first time.  I don't have a lot of lines and they don't bother me.  I am almost 56 and as my grandfather always said, well preserved in alcohol.	1
Good product, but it is very strong.  I use it twice a week.	1
Of the Baxter of California Vitamin Cleansing Bars that DH uses, the Italian Lime & Pomegranate is my favorite. It smells simply wonderful. If DH is doing the choosing, he tends to select the Citrus & Herbal Musk. His regular daily routine includes Baxters body wash and the Vitamin Cleansing bar soap. He uses Baxter shampoo and hair styling products too. It makes him easy to buy for at holidays, birthdays, etc. Since I'm a big fan of the way he looks and smells, and buy a lot of his products, I of course wholeheartedly recommend Baxter products.	1
This is a great product. I was happy to find it on Amazon. Hydrates skin and sets the mineral sunscreen powder.	1
Near the end of the bottle the spray cap begins to clog and no amount of cleaning seems to clear it.  Great product though.	1
I have used several different Vichy brand products over the past year and have been very happy with the quality of the products. This set comes in a cute tin, and are small but a bit bigger than sample sizes. They give you a good idea about how the products will work for you without commiting to larger sized bottles of the product. I like that it includes a face wash, serum and moisturizer. The products did feel lightweight and weren't too strong smelling which are winners in my skincare regime book.	1
Beautifully packaged serum with a pleasant light scent.  The texture glides nicely and can be used in evenings as part of your daily routine, as well as under makeup like a primer.  My preference is hydrating my skin without leaving it greasy, and find this serum is an excellent compromise.  For the summertime, this is just right in weight to absorb in without making the skin look too oily.	1
Life's too short to mess around in the bathroom all day, but I admit I love trying out products. I've dabbled in a lot of different moisturizers, serums, and creams over the years, both things I bought, Vine review items, and products in friends' showers and bathroom cabinets (yes, I do ask permission!), and this one is a big ol' winner.  I'm in my mid-50s with combination skin that used to be oily. I've been using this serum sparingly -- ONE squirt, which gives you just a wee bit of lotion, but it's very thin and slidey. Maybe I'm just the target audience for it, or maybe it's wishful thinking, but there's a new softness and radiance to my skin. I still use my grocery store eye cream for the delicate eye area, and follow up with with a heavier-bodied moisturizer such as&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Trader-Joe-s-Nourish-Antioxidant-Facial-Serum-Two-Pack/dp/B00G8QU4Q0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Trader Joe's Nourish Antioxidant Facial Serum Two Pack</a>, but I'm sold on this<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/SKIN-CO-Roma-Truffle-Therapy-Serum-1-0-fl-oz/dp/B00GB2ODJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">SKIN&CO Roma Truffle Therapy Serum, 1.0 fl. oz.</a>&nbsp;as the first product to go on my skin after cleansing.  At this rate, the bottle will last me about 3 months. Ain't nothing gonna make me 35 again, but this stuff is definitely brightening up my middle-aged mug.	1
I layered this cream on top of the serum as an overnight treatment. Not too heavy, absorbs well; felt wonderful. Unfortunately it breaks me out. I don't think its best suited for combination skin: perhaps dry skin. From now on, I will be using it on my dcollet and neck instead.	1
This is really a great medium weight moisturizer. I have been using it for just over three weeks, and while I haven't noticed any significant changes in my skin, I'm 53, sensitive skin and love the sun, the Roma Truffle Therapy cream is probably the best non-greasy, hydrating facial moisturizer I've ever used.  I'm giving it 4/5 stars only because the price point is a bit high and I didn't experience a visually noticeable difference in my skin, but I most certainly felt it. So 4.5 stars is really more appropriate, and maybe long term, it may deserve 5 stars.  It's the peak of summer, we've been at the ocean for the last 10 days and the Truffle Cream has been an exceptional skin rejuvenator and protector. I use a separate clinical quality sunscreen which I apply first in the morning - under the cream, and at night, I reapply it again after washing my face and neck before bedtime.  I love that's it's not heavy or greasy and it doesn't evaporate instantly like a serum. For my fair aging skin is a daily moisterizing home run, now I'd mm like to order the serum and try them together. (Reviewed by my wife)	1
Nice consistency...light and absorbs fast.  I have not been using it long but walked past a mirror (with no makeup on) and caught my reflection out of the corner of my eye.  My skin looked different enough (in a good way...younger...smoother) to make me stop...look again...and think "what am I doing different?"...the only thing I was doing differently that I could think of was using Truffle Therapy Cream.  My only criticism would be that I have gotten a few blemishes (which is unusual for me) during this trial period.	1
This one is nearly identical to that one, branded by Zwilling.  The original one isn't branded as far as I could tell but it's the virtually identical, with only one exception--the scissor's tip is rounded :( .  A sharp point would have allowed easier and more precise trimming of hang nails and cuticles, but it's not a deal breaker.  I hope this thing lasts like my original one, which I used a few times a day for almost 7 years, to maintain hygiene (trim nails/cuticles, clean under nails while washing my hands) and open the occasional package or seal.  I've had it for a few months now, so far so good. No rusting from getting wet, and it's held up to daily abuse as a key fob.  While it's a tad bulky, it's never been a problem for me and I HIGHLY recommend it..  If you're looking for something a bit thinner and only need something to trim your nails or hangnail on the go, you can try&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/this/dp/B000G647YS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">this</a>&nbsp;one, which I own as well. I was thrilled when I managed to find this replacement.  The	1
Juicy Couture Viva La Noir Eau de Partum is marketed for evening & special occasion wear.  It boasts that it will embody the woman who is dangerous - but in a good way.  While I'm not quite sure what that means, I can say that a little spray of this Juicy partum will grab you by your senses and will continue to provide a strong scent for quite a long time - even if the skin area gets wet.  Scent-wise, this partum is suppose to have floral top notes and vanilla & candlewood lower notes.  I expected to smell more mandarin (dangerous, right?), but my nose says gardenia & vanilla come through the most.  If you are a Juicy fan, then you know what scent you are purchasing and how the scent interacts with your body. For those buying without smelling, this Juicy scent is a very sweet, floral/vanilla scent more than a musky mandarin scent.	1
Juicy Couture Viva La Noir is incredibly impressive right out of the box. It comes in a beautiful pink bottle with a clear crystal-like cap, and beautiful black satin bow.  It's very feminine and gorgeous, a bottle any girly girl would love adding to their collection.  At first I wasn't sure I was going to like the scent. It's a very full blossoming scent with berries, vanilla, caramel, and sandalwood. At first glance, I thought this fragrance went on a bit heavy, but the more I tried to figure out what the notes were in this fragrance, the more I liked it. I wasn't sure I was smelling caramel, I've never smelled that in a fragrance, but sure enough, it does have vanilla and caramel notes. What you first smell is juicy berries, which was new for me. I normally go for light  floral scents . . .  Victoria's Secret, Bombshell, another VS which unfortunately is no longer made, Dream Angel Wish, and my absolute favorite go to fragrance, Philosophy, Falling in Love. But what those three all have in common is they don't last at all, much to my dismay.  Viva La Noir lasts far longer, becoming lighter and more floral as the day goes on. Applied to my neck, hair, and wrists, the scent lasts about 4 hours before I felt like I could use a light re-application.  This is a really pretty scent which could be worn by just about anyone - from late teens to mature women. If you aren't sure whether or not you like it at first, explore it a bit. Trying to figure out what's in the mix might give you an appreciation for the subtle complexities of this lovely fragrance.  I recommend Juicy Couture Viva La Noir to any woman looking for a new fragrance to jazz up her collection.	1
Here's what it smells like !  Kidding ... you need to olfactory sample it at a store. Lots of buyers, must be 'in'. Worked for me as a gift.	1
Don't let the tacky bottle deter you from this fragrance! It's a fun scent for going out on the town, but definitely not for everyday use, or even day time- it's quite sweet and really youthful. The only qualms I have with this perfume are price and longevity; the bottle is deceptively heavy, but it's mostly just glass you're paying for and the scent wears off pretty quickly.	1
I really love this perfume.  It has a nice light floral scent.  I give it two thumbs up!	1
This is so easy to apply if you need to get ready in a hurry - no liquid, no blending sponges, no foundation brushes. I would take 10 minutes every afternoon before my husband got home to pat on some of this powder to make myself a little more presentable after wrangling babies all day. Please keep in mind - I say powder because it is a powder, but it's a powder foundation. You can use it on its own, but in order to prevent transferring or break down, you need a good setting spray applied over this. I have applied it by itself, but as a result I've experienced transferring when I did so. Another benefit of powder foundation is that you are much less likely to see product pilling, which is when your product balls up on your skin. This often happens when you're applying more than one layer without letting it absorb thoroughly or if you're applying too large an amount.  Coverage is great, and you can easily build to a full even application. This applies with a round sponge pad, and there's a pretty good amount in the pan. Dermablend is a professional brand, and for good reason. It's pretty high quality makeup - I believe I first came across it years ago in a tattoo magazine article or letters section for a future bride who needed to cover a tattoo on her wedding day. It's good stuff, and I like that at this point in time, it's possible for the average consumer to get products like this without being a professional or having a connection.	1
I have this product in Suntan.  I have pale skin, so Suntan is dark enough to use as a bronzer when I haven't been getting any sun.  With a light tan, it's perfect as a foundation.  This powder really does need to be applied only once in the morning and lasts all day (unless I exercise or get caught in a lot of rain).  It seems to help control oiliness as my face doesn't feel dirty at the end of the day and isn't shiny.  I have sensitive skin but haven't experienced any irritation or breakouts.  In addition, there isn't any heavy perfume or chemical smell to this makeup.  I love the way this makeup minimizes pores!  Somehow, there's enough substance to address large pores without any caking in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face.  That's a hard combination to find.  I recommend this makeup.  It's comfortable, beautiful, long-wearing, and effective.	1
Simply one of the best products that my wife utilized, it was easy to apply and didn't cause any irritation. It's spreads out properly and the colour looks wonderful	1
I've been using Dermablend for years but had never tried this powder -- and I can't believe what I was missing. I've used and loved both the liquids like Flawless Creator and the solids like Cover Creme, but nothing from Dermablend or any other company has ever covered messed-up spots as fast or as flawlessly as this powder. When I have a horrible zit or a red, rough patch or anything else that is not only discolored but has a different texture from the rest of my face, this is what I reach for. I put just a bit on one corner of the included sponge and just dab it on the spot and it's GONE. And it's totally opaque, and best of all it's matte and because it's powder it doesn't settle into grooves or accentuate rough skin; it just sits on top and conceals everything. The first time I used it I was in such bad shape and I had to go to a client meeting, and when I tried this I nearly cried with relief. I hope you're never so desperate, but if you are, may you know the reassurance of having this on hand.  Here's a tip to make sure that this is really invisible on your skin: If you don't know your Dermablend color, order a free sample kit from Dermablend's site before you order. You can't trust your monitor's colors and color matching is very precise with Dermablend, so it's critical to get it right.	1
Wife says- Really good product. Easy in the application and requires an occasional re-touching. I do not have sensitive skin but products that are low-quality tend to break out my skin. It's not the case with the Dermablend Powder. I apply it with a kabuki brush, set it with MAC spray face mist, which helps it set on my skin beautifully.	1
Maybe it's because I'm so used to liquid foundation, but I found this to be very cakey. It didn't go on smooth at all. The makeup quickly settled into my pores and it was very easy to rub some off onto my shirt, hand, etc. As for coverage, blemishes were covered but the makeup kind of piled up around spots and made it obvious that I was covering something.	-1
This is moisturizing gloss, darker in color than I usually wear, but for a change dark is o.k.	1
From the wife:  it's a nice neutral lip color that's perfect for summer and would go great with those smokey eyes.  The color is just a shade or two darker than the average lip color, with more sheen.  It lays on a bit gooey, but I just scrape a bit more off at the lip of the bottle container and have a bit more control on how much to put on.  This lasts typical of a lip gloss, reapplication is needed after a couple of hours and definitely after eating or drinking.  It's worth a try.	1
The new lip gloss from Julep that is the best is called Lively. It is a cross between a burgundy and a strawberry. Julep lip gloss, has a subtle color, shine, and hydration. These subtle sheers feel as good as they look. Julep has an exclusive blend of ingredients, just look on the packaging.  I apply a small amount of lip gloss across the middle of my upper and lower lips to create the illusion of fullness. It glides on smoothly, feels good, and lasts for several hours. This co,or Lively will look good on most everyone. It makes my teeth look whiter, my lips fuller and more attractive.  Recommended. prisrob 08-03-16	1
My girlfriend loved it.	1
The actual polish is a little thicker than what I'm used to from other brands but the results are so much better than any other brands.  I love the color saturation and overall quality of the polish!  You just have to learn to put on light thin coats and add more layers as you go.  Don't clump on a thick layer!  The polish itself does not peel or chip off easily.  It really adheres well to the nail bed and I'm very happy with the purchase.	1
I'm love it!	1
Nice calm yellow	1
Julep nail polish is one of the best on the market. It goes on so smoothly, leaves no marks nor does it cause bumps. It dies not muss easily and selems to last longer than other nail polishes.  This London, mauve color is perfect for my fingernails and toes. I brought it to my manicurist, and she applied it after my pedicure. It is muted but bright, I love it on my toes. On my finger nails, line a more subtle approach, this week I have a mauve color. Julep is a line you can rely upon, and I do think it is one of the best on the market.  Recommended. prisrob 09-05-16	1
While the container isn't very big, and much smaller than other nail polish, most colors don't get used enough before they go bad, so this works for us (although if you are a heavy user this might be a bigger deal).  Goes on nice and smooth, doesn't chip, and has a nice subtle coloring.	1
Not one to wear nail polish very often I like the ease of application. It goes on smooth with good even coverage. I did not use a base coat or a top coat and it lasted for three days before chipping while gardening and doing outdoor work. It is a pleasant purple gray that does not draw a ton of attention, just looks nice. I have pale skin and it looks good, my niece has dark skin and it looks even better on her. Would get this brand again.	1
Nail polish works great. Very log lasting.  Cool colors as well.  Really like this brand and will try other colors.	1
I loved this chemical free vegan polish.  It came in a very pretty bottle design and the color (Alaina) was a pretty greyish purple. I like that it was fast drying as well.  Nothing worse then trying to wait to let your nails dry.  I did not use a top or base coat but used 3 coats of polish and it looked great and stayed looking good for over a week.  I don't mind that there is smaller amount then other brands, I would rather use it up then have it sit around and get old and toss it out. Over all this is a great product.	1
The bottle is tall and has narrow base, so it wants to overturn when you try to use it. The color looked nice in the bottle but on my very white cold hands it looks like I am dead already. It looks considerably better after I wash my hands in hot water and they get some more color, though, but I cannot run to the sink all the time! The polish is quite runny, and I had to reapply it because it would run around the nail bed and spill on the skin. To have proper coverage, it needs a few layers, one layer is too thin and is somewhat see through. It did dry quite fast, and it smelled milder than usual, which I appreciated. After several hours of wear, some small chips started to appear at the edges of the nails, and I managed to scrape off a portion of the polish from a nail, too.	-1
Merveillance purports to fill in lines + wrinkles. It does this by using acrylates copolymers, which "set" into a thin film kind of like hairspray to keep it all in place. This also provides the tightening/toning effect so your skin will feel firm.  In some formulas, the film, when disturbed, rolls off into little balls (like Clarins Beauty Balm)--- but this formula is expertly blended and will not do that.  If you're looking for a thick, hydrating creme -- this isn't it. Instead, Merveillance is what i call a "priming moisturizer" -- one that smooths, lightly hydrates, and practically vanishes into the skin, tightening and toning, leaving a matte-ish finish to act as a "canvas" for your other potions. It's what Clarins Beauty Balm *wishes* it was.  Ingredients: Aqua/water, Rubus Idaeus (raspberry) Fruit Water, Rosa Moschata Seed Oil, Glycerin, Persea Gratissima (avocado) Oil, Arachidyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) Butter, Corylus Avellana (hazel) Seed Oil, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Caprylic/capric Triglyceride, Parfum/fragrance, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Albizia Julibrissin Bark Extract, Lauroyl Lysine, Dimethicone, Tocopherol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Capryloyl Glycine, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Gluconate, Xanthan Gum, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Benzyl Alcohol, Ammonium Lactate, Hemerocallis Fulva Extract, Geranylgeranylisopropanol, Sodium Benzoate [n2903/a].	1
I have used it daily and although I can really feel my skin is softer, I see no loss of my visible lines.  Granted my lines are deep because they are below my eyes and are from eye puffiness that is worse in the morning and then recedes as the day goes on.  I noticed the smoothness of my skin one day accidentally when my hand swiped over that area and I had been using it for exactly 7 days.  You can definitely feel the difference in skin texture if it's adjacent to a place that hasn't had the cream.  The package doesn't really say how often to use it, but I see here on Amazon it says twice a day.  So maybe twice a day would give me a better result. However my face cream routine is only once day and so I fail to do it twice.  The perfume smell is a bit strong at first (I am sensitive to some perfumes) but it dissipates rather quickly.  Really they should've left out the perfume but it works for me.	1
Let's just say that I am a woman of "a certain age" whose face shows it.  I have long given up on looking like a 20-something, heck, even a 30-something.  So while I think it would be great for my visible lines to become invisible, my main expectations for a face cream these days are to moisturize and feel good.  Based on these criteria, the NUXE cream works well.  It goes on a bit thick (it's definitely a cream, not a lotion), but it has a smooth, non-greasy feel, and after I've applied it, it doesn't feel heavy on my face.  It also possesses a light, not unpleasant fragrance. I like how my facial skin feels after I've applied it.  Does it really get rid of visible lines?  On that, I'm agnostic.  I've been using it for several weeks now, and I can't say I've noticed much--indeed, any--difference.  But like I said, my expectations were low to begin with on that count.  (I've had my hopes dashed by expensive serums and creams before.)  I do like how it makes my skin feel, and that's enough for me.  One caveat:  The NUXE cream does not, as far as I can tell, include any kind of sunscreen, so I wouldn't suggest relying solely on it.  I apply a moisturizer with sunscreen on top of the NUXE cream in the mornings.	1
I've tried a lot of facial creams, and this has to be one of my favorite.  The overall experience is luxurious and enjoyable, and it works fairly well - although, there's no such thing as a miracle skin cream.  The packaging is minimal and attractive.  The jar feels substantial, and the lid isn't fragile or difficult to open.  I've had facial cream lids crack or break on me in the past, and there is no issue with that here.  I also dropped the jar on the sink by accident at one point, and it didn't chip or break.  The cream itself smells quite strong, a chemically-floral smell.  If that was intentional, I think they could have scaled it back a bit.  However, the scent dissipates after a few minutes and becomes unnoticeable.  The texture is FANTASTIC.  That's probably my favorite thing about this cream.  It's almost like dipping your finger in butter.  In fact I was initially concerned that it would be greasy since it was so thick and luxurious.  It is not!  It vanishes into the skin within seconds and leaves my face nice and moisturized and ready for make-up.  The other positive for me is that it works well on sensitive skin.  I often have the experience of burning or stinging when I moisturize, even with fairly nice product.  This does not hurt my skin in any way, even the thinner skin around my eyes.  In terms of the reduction of lines, I think they have something here.  I'm not sure it's a lasting effect, but my skin soaks the moisture up so well that I've actually noticed that the lines between my eyebrows decrease, and take longer to show.  This may just be that I'm hydrated, but hyaluronic acid is getting positive feedback from clinical trials, so I'm hopeful.  I think the only difficulty here is the price, which is fairly steep.  However, because of the wonderful spread and consistency of the cream, I doubt that it will need to be replenished that often - maybe every few months.	1
the tagline for this says that its "great for everyday wear".  I would agree with that sentiment.  Its scent is very light, and to me, it seems like it works really great in the springtime or in the summer, because of its citrus smell.  The bottle is a bit off-putting, because its that familiar "juicy couture" overblown shabby chic kind of appeal.  But the fragrance itself is really nice.  Its clean and citrusy, not sweet nor musky.  Definitely a good gift for any young woman, or to buy for yourself.	1
Juicy Couture Malibu perfume is described as having passion fruit, sparkling jasmine, and sensual musk.  My perfume preference is either very clean or fruity (but not sweet) smelling.  I normally don't like "perfumey" smells or perfumes that contain musk, amber, sandalwood, etc.  As a reference, my favorites are Clinique Happy, different versions of Bobbi Brown (Beach and Bath), and several different Clean brand scents.  I couldn't resist on the Juicy Couture Malibu because of the passion fruit in the description.  It is very fruity (but not sweet) smelling at first.  It then becomes more floral and musk smelling with a little bit of the fruit smell.  The musk isn't enough to turn me off from it like other musky scents do.  I'm in my 40s, and I really like this scent.  The Malibu scent lasts for a decent amount of time (I spray it once in the air to get it on my hair and once on a wrist to rub with the other).  It's gone from my wrists by the end of the day because of washing my hands, but I can still smell it in my hair when it swings.  Personally, I think the bottle looks kind of cheesy.  Well, not the bottle itself, but the plastic heart attached to the lid.	1
I noticed my niece has been attempting to act more girly (she was a bit of a tomboy) and thought she might like a perfume.  My wife mentioned that Juicy seems to be popular in my niece's age group (17 years old) so I thought I would give it a try.  It is a nice clean scent that is not overwhelming.  For some reason I smelled a nice citrus / grapefruit scent.  Wore off after a couple of hours but still smelled nice.  Gave to my niece she enjoyed it and has been using it daily.  She claims it smells like beach weather for whatever that means.	1
This is our 2nd Juicy Couture perfume. The Malibu, just as the previous scent we have, is absolutely delicious.  Not at all overpowering, but instead a very gentle, very sexy scent that lasts a good while.  These 2 scents have become the favorites of both my wife and our 18 yr old daughter.  Our daughter is extremely fashion conscious and picky...yet she loves this one.	1
This is another very new and "now" fragrance that has the Juicy Couture signature youthful, girly, fruity blend that so many of us love.  Gone are the days of ancient bouquets of jasmine and rose, replaced with man made fruit scents that are for your nose what Skittles are for your taste buds.  To the fruit bowl this one adds the beguiling scent of surf and sand with the "water" addition that I am fond of in scents.  Yes it is beachy.  Fruit punch on the beach with your toes in the sand.  A strawberry margarita and sunscreen.  And if driftwood has a scent, as the perfumers who concoct the thousands of newer scents in the lab would have us believe, we are right next to a big pile of driftwood, some of it charred and damp from last night's rained out bonfire on the beach.  This also has the glittery scent of nouveau riche polish with the addition of white musk and amber, making this a much more interesting blend than some of the pure fruit salads Juicy Couture has been famous for.  Men find all of the scents from this company amazingly sexy I have noticed.  Sophisticated, subtle, not at all.  In your face with the cherries, melons and berries all the way, but in a fresh and happy way.  People love Juicy Couture scents even more than the handbags and clothing line, because this company intimately knows and understands their target customers.  They are young, have money, and love Skittles.	1
First, in regarding the appearance of authenticity of this product:  The bottle is very attractive; there is a clear plastic snap-on heart ring around the "stopper" (I removed it because it looks very teen-ish) it is very attractive for a desk or vanity.  It is a spray.  There is a cut-out type design on the face of the bottle and it looks nice on the vanity.  Fragrance is by nature subjective, and this one is a fresh scent that sparkles and is perfect for day.  It doesn't seem to last a terribly long time, so be aware of that!	1
The first thing that I notice when I spray this on my wrists and neck is it's very fruity smelling.  I haven't used any fragrances like this before.  It smell nice, but I'm not sure that it will be my favorite.  Weird thing is my husband swore it smelled different on my wrists than my neck.  So I would recommend, but i don't think it's my favorite.	1
The fragrance is very sweet and floral at the same time. This overly sweet fragrance is similar to other perfumes  my daughter has gotten in the past and that are marketed toward teens and preteens. Because it is an Eau de Toilette the fragrance does not stay strong smelling for too long. This is a good thing (in my opinion) since teens like my daughter, can spray on too much initially. The bottle is glass and  the top is acrylic. My daughter loves the bottle look and the fragrance. She is very happy with it.	1
I have been using this product on my face both morning and night the last few weeks. I have dehydrated and somewhat sensitive skin and my fair skin gets red after washing and when I am outside in the cold. This product has a creamy gel like texture and absorbs pretty quickly. It has no detectable anti-aging properties but does what is supposed to in that it keeps my skin moisturized all day. It has a light fragrance and seems mild. I think there are other moisturizers on the market for this price point I like better for the reason that they feel slightly less sticky when first applied - I think its a matter of preference for me toward cream over gel. It is worth a try, and has high quality ingredients but as with any beauty product it is worth a try in the store to see for yourself.	1
This is a delightfully scented lightweight lotion that smooths on beautifully and is not overpowering. The description of the scent made me wonder if there would be too many competing undertones, but when it comes to fragrance, all I know is whether I like it or not. This one I love. It's a wonderful youthful scent, and lasts for hours, which makes it worth the cost. You don't have to reapply several times a day like you might with cheaper products. And it comes in a beautiful bottle, which adds to the feeling of feminine luxury.	1
This would make a really great gift.  The bottle has a faceted cut that really sparkles.  I can see this sitting on a dressing table with other pretty bottles.  I tend to like darker, richer scents like Sapphire or Opium so I am the worst possible person to review a flowery scent.  At first all I could smell was the roses and a little jasmine.  I even did a kind of head shake and shiver, trying to get the smell away from me.  But after it started to absorb into my skin better, I started to like it more.  I started being able to smell the more subtle amber and musk.  I love amber.  But none of these are scents I would wear as a single scent.  I cant imagine using this as a body lotion.  The scent is way too strong for that.  Maybe a little on the dcolletage.	1
This is lighter than I expected and gives little color when worn on my fair-medium skin. It does add a bit of shimmer, which is a nice touch for evening, but you'll probably need to use this with darker eye shadow or blush. The pan holds a generous amount of product, which brushes up easily. Unless you've used it before, I'd suggest checking this out in a store first to be certain of the color.	1
Made my scalp extremely flakey and gross. Was also weird clumpy texture.	-1
I wasn't sure what to expect as although I've loved everything I've ever tried from Oribe, I associate it more with haircare than with beauty.  Moreover, red has historically not been my goto lip shade and when I have gone red, I have been used to choosing among many shades of red to find the one that it the best match with my personal coloring.  I was a bit thrown by a line that only has one shade of red ("The Red") and only 6 shades total.  Turns out I needn't be.  I'm not sure if this will be the case with everyone, but I found this shade of red quite flattering with my medium, neutral toned skin and ashy blonde hair.  I have dry lips and also found this to be creamy and forgiving.  It doesn't accentuate lines and when worn over liner I find I can get a few hours of wear out of this.  I definitely wouldn't confuse it with a long wear lipstick, but it's on par with the typical lipsticks I own.  Typically Bite has been my go-to brand for lipsticks but now I'm definitely curious to try other shades in the Oribe line.	1
A soft and moisturizing cleaner. It was quite basic and got the job done well. I liked that my picky skin didn't object to this and that it left my skin feeling hydrated. It's for basic everyday cleansing. Quality and quantity are great and this lasted for months.	1
Great cleanser for super sensitive skin! Dry, combination, doesnt matter. This cleanser seems to work well on any skin type except maybe super oily.	1
I love this cleanser.  I have sensative, dry skin but this cleanser has not bother me at all.  I don't notice that there is much a scent to the product at all, and you only need to use a very small amount, yes, this is higher end in pricing, but when using a pea sized amount, this cleanser is going to last a very long time.  After cleansing, my skin is left feeling soft and refreshed, not dry and tight like so many cleaners.  I will definitely purchase this in the future, when I container runs dry!	1
This Karuna Single Hydrating Facial Mask worked wonders on my dry face.  It left my skin soft, with a sheen and glow that only much younger people have.  It's now hours later and my face still feels soft and smooth and not at all dry.  I will definitely use it again.  These facial masks are for single use.  They should be used right after cleansing your face.  I put it on as directed and waited 20 minutes.  There was enough product on the mask itself that, I gently eased some of it onto my neck.  (By the way, although I use a daily moisturizer, it doesn't moisturize as well as this mask's ingredients.)  I removed the mask and discarded it.  I wasn't sure what to do with the excess on my face so, I lightly blotted with a tissue and let it dry.  My skin looks and feels so good that I didn't use my foundation--just mascara and lipstick--for the day.  This is an excellent way to revitalize your face!	1
I've mainly tried Japanese, Korean and Thai sheet masks, but this Taiwanese mask is also excellent quality. The fabric is thick and the serum hydrated without causing any redness or sensitivity.  I cooled the mask in the fridge before using it, which made it feel wonderfully cool on the skin.  I've tried a few of the other Karuna masks and find this hydrating mask to be one of my favorites.	1
Feels great after one  use. Going to have to get more. Helps the skin feel alive and fresh again even at my 50+ years!	1
Hopefully this sentence will be outdated and seem bizarre when you read this, but right now there are a number of reviews for car windows covers on a page selling a Karuna hydrating face mask.  This review is for that face mask.  I am not a face mask expert, as I've only used this one and some from Neutrogena.  I didn't like the Neutrogena ones at all because they dripped all over and were an immense pain to get on.  Sure, they felt good once on, but they wanted to slip off and were just a hassle.  This mask from Karuna has absolutely none of those issues.  It applied easily, didn't drip at all that I could tell, and stayed in place even if I walked around with it on.  It felt very soothing while on, and my skin did feel better after I removed it.  Nah, I didn't look 20 years younger or anything, but it definitely felt good to use.  One thing to note is that it will not cling to facial hair at all.  I currently have a goatee, and the mask just hung loose around that area.  Everywhere else, though, it stayed in place like a champ.  Is also pulled off easily with no clinging.  Just a great experience.	1
Eek!! This is sudsy and makes my skin burn immediately upon applying. I pulled it off right away and threw it in the trash but it still caused my skin to feel red and burned. I covered my face in argan oil to make it feel better. Yuck. Ingredients for this thing are all chemicals and fragrances.	-1
The reviews on this page seem to be for car window visors, but my review is for the Karuna Single Hydrating + Face Mask pictured in the promo.  I didn't like this mask for the following reasons  - It makes a mess.  The mask is so saturated that it drips all over the place.  I had to keep a facial tissue handy to clean my neck as the solution dripped down. - Fragrance is listed as an added ingredient.  I thought the scent was too strong for something that is supposed to be used on my face for 10-20 minutes. - I have dry sensitive skin.  Consequently, some patches on my face were irritated by the fragrance.  It actually burned a little. If you have dry skin I would skip this mask. - I found the packaging to be a bit wasteful.  I think getting a facial mask in a jar would last longer and the packaging can be recycled.	-1
I've used many, many masks in the past, but this has to be my new favorite.  Let's start with the many, many pluses: 1.) easily fits on face and the backing easily peals off 2.) not one drip! NOT ONE! WOW! 3.) able to be torn (with ease) to fit perfect around eyes 4.) every single bubble can be smoothed out 5.) stays on face without slipping one bit! (Again, WOW!) 6.) Leaves skin plump and glowing  Negatives: -NOT ONE NEGATIVE!  In total frankness, I am demanding on my skin. I use prescription retinoids (every other day), I micro-needle (twice a week), etc. Sometimes it just really needs something to soothe it (especially if I go a little nuts with the micro-needling). This does exactly that. I am so impressed.  And, here's a little tip: use the left over liquid in the packet on your neck and hands. They will be left just as smooth as your face.  Truly phenomenal product! I will buy this again and again. Highly, highly recommended.	1
Another favorite with my wife and daughter: Excellent product!  I love the Obagi products  they always work well (though quite procey).  This moisturizer/sunscreen is another winner.  I love the aroma.  Its not overwhelming, but is that summer-refreshing-sunscreen aroma that reminds me of sunshine.  The 360 line is designed specifically for younger skin; geared towards preventative measures.  Truly the one thing we can do to prevent premature aging is sunscreen, so this product is a must.  Its great under makeup and gives enough moisture without feeling heavy.  I do recommend applying and waiting a few minutes before using foundation.  Waiting to apply foundation will help the foundation glide on easier.  So, while this product is on the expensive, side, I still need to give it five stars.  Love it that much!	1
Living in Florida, sunscreen is a very important essential to have. I admit I don't put it on half as much as I should be (nor do I drink water as much as I should)! The reason being I don't like the way most sunscreen's feel, especially on the face. They always leave behind this chalky feeling and it feels like there is dried up clay on my face. It's just icky!  This suncreen doesn't do that too much, while it still gives me that slight feeling, it doesn't make me feel icky and it absorbs into the skin fairly quickly. The product also does do a bit of a job moisturizing my skin as I do suffer from dry skin (probably from not drinking water).  While I do like this product I think the price point is a little too high for it. It's hard to find products that fit and match everyone's preferences and it's even harder when a good product isn't within your price range.  Hopefully I can soon find a drugstore (and a much more affordable) brand to do the same thing.	1
I love this stuff.  I wear it mostly when working out outdoors.  Love it just Wish it wasn't so expensive..	1
Living in Alaska, there are only a few  months when I need to use this sunscreen.  However, I recently traveled out of state and sat in the warm sun for quite a while.  I used the Obagi sunscreen and it really worked.  My skin did not get burnt and it was not dried out by the sun's rays.	1
My skin is sensitive and I've found that I do have to be careful not to use it too often, or the retinol starts to bother it. So long as I'm careful with the pacing, though, it does really nice things for my skin and I feel like I'm much clearer!	1
This is wonderful conditioner. It should be. It costs almost 4X as much as my usual conditioner. My usual conditioner does a pretty good job on my thick, fine-textured, wavy-straight, color-treated hair. This ORIBE conditioner does an excellent job and smells like a yacht in Portofino in June. I'm not kidding, the fragrance is that good.  After use, my hair is fluffy, bouncy, shiny, smooth. Whose hair is this? Wow! It's mine!  Don't be intimidated by the "Intense" part of the description. You only need a little bit to untangle and smooth your hair. It doesn't weight the hair down or make it limp. At least it doesn't do it to mine.  I wish I could justify the expense of the corresponding shampoo. I'm afraid to find out how good it is.  Sob.	1
This conditioner is so awesome! I love it! It makes my hair look so shiney and healthy. It also makes it feel incredibly soft and gives my hair body. I used to use biolage  but now I am switching to prove because I like the results better. Try it and you will be very pleased I know I am. I highly recommend this product!	1
I was initially disapppointed because this mascara isn't fabulous for volume. HOWEVER, this is definitely one of the better options for lengthening and staying power. I've already repurchased this, and I recommend it to people who want a good lengthening mascara.	1
This is a really nice little mascara that doesn't clump. My lashes look good for most of the day..I think this might have something to do with the rosewater that's mixed in. My lashes don't get hard and gross at the end of the day!	1
This is a good mascara. The applicator is a narrow wand, which I find works better than the fat ones.  I rarely get smudges on my browbone with this, and I often do with other mascaras.  Doesn't crumble and fall, either.  About equal in volumizing and lengthening.  I haven't found a better mascara.	1
My very picky about her mascara daughter stole this from me, so I have to give it 5 stars, since she kept it!  I loved the mascara while I had it, nice long, thick lashes, no clumping....the price is up there, but I've found that cheap mascara is just that, cheap....so if I can find something good, I'll pay for it.  A huge plus with this mascara is how incredibly easy it washes off, I didn't end up with raw, red eyes after washing, neither did my daughter and she has very sensitive skin.  I will definitely buy this brand in the future.	1
I tried two new mascaras this week and finally decided to use one per eye for a true comparison.  The VINCENT LONGO Volume Plus Mascara (Made in Italy) won over the Make Up For Ever (Made in France).  Both are easy to apply, the LONGO has a thinner applicator.  Neither irritated my sensitive eyes.  The LONGO left no skin stains on the lower lid, unlike the other mascara.  LONGO did not clump at all, the lashes are still well separated and look very natural.  I applied only one layer of mascara of each, as that is the maximum I typically use.  Both flaked as the day progressed, neither was really bad.  Both were easy to remove, the LONGO being easier because it was less clumpy.  Since my tubes are both new, I can't comment on how long the mascara creams last in the tube.  I like the simple packaging of the LONGO and really like the colors of the package.  The tube is interesting in that the cavity section is a glossy black and the applicator section is a matted black that is easier to hold if fingers are damp.  I think the price is high for a mascara and have deducted a star only for that reason.	1
My wife and daughter love Obagi products: We love this product; it has a nice a nice fresh aroma, and it is RICH.  One pump is all you need for both eye and any more is a waste.  You definitely don't want to waste this product either, as it is not inexpensive. Obagi has a reputation for being a leader in the skin care industry for a reason.  If your eye area is in need of rich (but not greasy) hydration, you will love this product	1
Holy crap this is one expensive product!  I know people are always talking about preventing wrinkles and fine lines! But I'm Asian and wrinkles aren't something I'm TOO worried about even if I am in my early 30's. As far as the preventing wrinkles element, I can't speak on that but I can for they hydration!  What I do like about this product is the moisturizing element. I do apply it under my eyes and a little bit on my upper cheeks because this is the area that dries up a lot and tends to flake and peel during the change of seasons and during random times in the summer and all through winter. There isn't much product in this tube, you're only getting .05oz after all so I try not to apply it on a daily basis. It does help to keep that area of my face nicely hydrated but now I'm trying my best to conserve the rest for winter.  Perhaps I can find a nice drugstore dupe for it or a high brand that's less expensive.	1
Very nice primer for more dry skin with no silicones. Pairs well with my foundations that do not have a silicone in them. Works great offering a bit of extra moisture for under make up. Realize it says 1fl. oz. and probably what is in the tube, but when held up to the light there is just over an inch of product missing from the tube which is a fairly small tube. Found that a bit disconcerting.	1
I love this face cream.  I've been using it every day for a few weeks.  Two pumps is enough to do face and neck.  It glides on smoothly and readily absorbs into the skin.  I love it because it doesn't feel like a lotion sitting on your skin or feel greasy.  I'm not sure how long it will last since it seems you use so little of it, but it's the best serum I've found so far and would likely reorder despite the price. I haven't noticed any difference in fine lines, but as another reviewer noted, if you read up on this serum you have to use it for a few months.  Living in a hot humid climate, I really appreciate how readily this absorbs into the skin.	1
I really like this cream, my only issue with it is the pump straw which is way too short so it's hard to get anything out of it unless you keep it upside down. But once that is solved, this is a very nice cream, the recommendation is to only pump twice, and it's more than enough for your face, it's light, doesn't feel greasy and it has a very pleasant scent.	1
Update: I discontinued use of this product as it clogged my pores. I've never had more than an occasional blemish here and there but I started breaking out in the places I used this product. Around my lips, nose and chin I had the worst breakout I think I've ever had. It took a few weeks after discontinuing for the breakouts to stop and for my skin to start to clear. I haven't heard of this happening in any other reviews I've read but I don't believe I'll try this again. I've removed two stars.  I have the most sensitive skin of anyone I've met. It's very hard for me to find a product be it moisturizer or makeup that I don't have a horrid reaction to. I've been waiting for about a week now for the familiar swollen red face to happen, and it hasn't. That is awesome all by itself. I'm going to officially give this my seal of approval on gentleness. The directions say to use two pumps of Lift + Perfect (see picture for what this looks like) and smooth over skin and neck. That turns out to be just the right amount for me. This first thing I noticed was how it glides on and feels like rubbing silicone on your face. It really does make your skin feel smooth. Immediately I thought great, this is going to be greasy and heavy but I was wrong. I looked in the mirror and there was no greasy shine at all and it didn't feel heavy on my skin in the slightest. My skin actually just feels hydrated. That's hard to achieve with combination skin of both oily and very dry. I haven't noticed my oily areas feeling any more oily and my dryness has actually gotten better. I haven't had any of my fine lines disappearing as of yet but I'm extremely hopeful. I did a little outside (of Amazon) research on the product and there appears to be good results but only after using for months. After longer use I will update my review. I was just so excited to let people know that it is a truly gentle product! It says it has no added fragrance and that any smell it has come from its ingredients. That's fine by me as it has a very delicate and light fragrance that I find lovely. It a definite winner so far.	-1
Got this for my wife who is a skin care junkie. She applied it to her face and is very pleased with the results that made her skin feel smooth. She said it takes just a small amount to cover her face.	1
A very clever way to have all your essential makeup together. Keeping this in my purse I never have to fumble around looking for my makeup, it all together. Great quality as I would compare it to brands like MAC and Bobbi Brown. I never have to take the pieces apart as it is very easy to get to and use together, but also pretty easy to put back together if needed. It does not come with applicators but who really uses them anyway. I usually throw them out and it's a waste so this is all around perfect for me with great color payoff as well.	1
These universal colors are perfect for creating a Summer Goddess look on most skin tones. The peach eyeshadow compliments and highlights my hazel eyes. The Suntan bronzer along my cheeks, forehead and chin makes my fair/medium skin look naturally sun kissed without the orange look that many bronzers create. I use the the Fawn cream tint on the apples of my cheeks and I also dab some on my lips. I complete my look with a swipe of the shimmery peach gloss over the tint on my lips. This compact set snaps together and easy to carry in my bag for any touch ups that I may need. I love the quality of this makeup and the convenience of the compact and I'm eager to try Jouer's The Little Black Dress collection for an evening look.	1
I don't wear a lot of makeup and the makeup that I do wear is often pretty natural-looking. You know, items that make my complexion look a little bit brighter without looking fake. I was super happy that this set from Jouer easily fit into my makeup wearing lifestyle. The colors are pretty toned down, really working to brighten my complexion instead of completely change the color of. I felt younger and fresher all day when I started wearing these products.  I'm also not a big lip product person, but the Jouer gloss is my idea of perfection! It goes on smoothly, doesn't make me look like a little kid, and doesn't feel sticky and icky.  It's great for just throwing in your purse for fix-ups on the go- I found myself wanting two sets for exactly this reason. Of course, it is a bit pricey, but definitely goes further than drugstore makeup and to me, is worth it.	1
It was perfect!	1
This is a raspberry fuchsia pinkish red. It has very faint sparkles. It's an ok cheery and happy color. I ordered Sugared Spice, Decadence, Masquerade, and Red Baroness after wearing this for a week.  I am looking forward to finding a more smoky, burgundy red.  Red Baroness is definitely smoky and adult red	1
Completely satisfied with the color. Always get compliments about my nail color. Maybe I would like it to be more classic red, but this one is great too. To make it more dark just make several thin layers. The bottle color pretty much the same as the exact nail polish color. Look great on either short or long nails.	1
Excellent	1
Gorgeous Color	1
I love Shellac nail polish! This color is amazing and goes with everything! The shine lasts for weeks with this color and is super durable. This nail polish last 2 weeks+. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone! It can easily be applied at home with the use of a UV light. UV lights can also be purchased on Amazon! I love this product so much that I have purchased over 20 bottles of it throughout the past 4 years.	1
This is a really pretty shimmery purple/dark pink color. It is very close to the color on the bottle.	1
Has a nice subtle aroma when you use only one spray.  If you over-do it, then the smell may become overpowering.  I wouldn't overuse this as this is more a perfume than a typical "refreshing spray".	1
NUXE Relaxing Fragrant Water is essentially a perfumed body spray.  Its a bit heavier on the perfumed fragrance than I expected.  I expected a light fragrance, but the fragrance is rather strong.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing if you are thinking perfume rather than body spray.  Overall, I like the fragrance; it has a baby powder type scent to it, and after given a little time to absorb, isn't quite as overwhelming as it is initially.  Since I plan on using it sparingly, as a perfume, Im happy with it, but if you are looking for a lightly scented body spray, this isn't exactly it.	1
Ok, so I'm not quite as skeptical or spirited as some of the reviewers.  I knew I was getting Relaxing Fragrant Water and I am ok with that.  The important thing is what makes the water relaxing and fragrant.  And does the relaxing fragrance delight the senses?  Before I ramble on, I did get this for my wife.  She tried and actually used it daily for a week before reviewing.  The scent is quite pleasing but it is not a light scent, nor is it overpowering.  My wife and stepdaughter both agreed it isn't bad.  None of us have a clue what "plastic toy pony" smells like (see other reviews) nor do we care to find out.  I do see that the product description is not very useful - there is no descriptive language about the scent.  My interpretation is a mix of coconut, subtle almond oil, musk, vanilla and some orange essence.  The company claims that the ingredients are 95% natural origin.  They are:  denatured alcohol, water, fragrance, limonene (i.e. lemon/orange oil), benzyl salicylate (i.e.a chemical used in cosmetics),  linalool (i.e. an alcohol chemical found in many flowers and spice plants), citronellal (i.e. citronella/rose/geranium), citral (found in lemon).  Sorry, no plastic toy pony.  Smelled directly, yeah, it is powerful.  Sprayed on in reasonable quantities, it is subtle and provides a good backdrop. I can't say there is any relaxation induced by this - we all found it somewhat energizing.  No side effects (rash, etc) were noted.  Would any of the members of my family buy it again?  I suspect we would not go out of our way to purchase it again, mainly because no one in our house regularly buys fragrant water.  But the whole bottle will be used.  I'll go ahead and give it 5-stars because we all agree that it has a nice scent.  On to the review.	1
'Fragrant Water' is a misleading label. I assumed it was basically a fancy name for 'body spray', which is probably fairly accurate, but it's much stronger than I'd expect. I normally get my body sprays from places like Bath & Body Works, and am used to using multiple sprays to get a strong, pleasant scent that fades quickly. This fragrant water requires 1 spray and lasts at least 5x longer (I have not done any scientific testing here, so I error on the side of caution in this estimate). I like the scent well enough. It has a very perfumy smell, i.e. it smells nice, but I can not identify any real smells in it. I wish they offered it in different scents. It comes in a nice bottle (I really liked the lid). I would call this a perfume rather than 'fragrant water'.	1
This is a good quality eye shadow. You do not need to apply a lot on your skin (small amount goes a long way), but I do wish the pink section showed up a little more on my eyelid (I have light skin).	1
This is my go-to favorite eye shadow that goes with everything. Another good Jane Iredale product.	1
This eyeshadow is really easy to apply and goes on very nice. Stays on for at least 8 hours without having to touch up.	1
Wife review: I wanted to give this 5 stars because it's Obagi but I just can't. This product didn't do anything to brighten or make the skin under my eye more refresh/healthy looking. These beauty products are not expected to be "fountain of youth" and given that I have dark circles, I didn't have any high expectations. However, I was hoping this product would atleast make minimal impact on the appearance but no effect at all after 2 weeks of use.	-1
I like this eye treatment.  It's not greasy and doesn't sting your eyes.  It feels like I'm treating the skin around my eyes well.  I try to remember to put it on my eye lids and under the eye every night.  It keeps my skin from looking older I think.  So far so good.  Will report back after I've used it several months.	1
One of the most challenging things for me is to find an eye cream hat will be potent without causing irritation.  Obagi offers two types of eye cream one very moisturizing and this one that is rich with vitamin C that helps brighten dark circles around the eyes.  Vitamin C is also strong antioxidant and it is Perfect for eye wrinkle prevention.  This product contains some very potent ingredients: Kinetin (plant hormone that promotes cell division, i.e. skin reproduction).  Kinetin when directly applied to the skin helps reduce the effects of skin aging including roughness, fine wrinkles, dilated blood vessels, and uneven pigmentation, For anyone curious this compound is extracted via autoclave from herring's sperm.  Zeatin -  is a plant hormone derived from adenine. Zeatin belongs to the family of plant-growth hormones called cytokinins and was discovered in immature corn kernels from the genus Zea, Zeatin is linked to anti-aging or the slowing down of aging processes in the human body - it is most often found in Moringa plant. ... Zeatine is a so-called Phytohormone.  Eye-Pro 3x reduces the appearance of skin aging around the delicate eye area. glycerin, lactobacillus ferment, ruscus aculeatus root extract, saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) extract, centella asiatica extract (contracts and heals wounds/skin isues significantly faster than untreated wounds), panthenol (Vitamin A), calendula (one of the most healing, anti-inflammatory, antiviral herbs on the planet)	1
This is one of the few under eye products that do not irritate my skin or eyes.  Usually I feel a bit of a burn with these types of products, but this goes on smooth and I don't feel a thing.  It works great under powder to hide my veins under the eyes.  I also apply at night before bed for long term results.	1
My wife loves it: This product is FANTASTIC!  Ive never used anything quite like it. So many products have huge claims but never follow through.  This really unique cream really does create a firm under-eye area; the skin looks illuminated (almost shiny), but it doesnt have any iridescence.  Its not a highlighter - it doesnt brighten the eye in that way.  It actually changes the appearance of the skin which brightens the eye area.  I did notice that I needed to put it on and let it set/dry before putting on makeup, otherwise my makeup looked a bit cakey.  Once I let it dry before putting my makeup on, the problem was solved.  Highly recommended.	1
I use this around my eyes and it seems to work pretty well. I only use it around my eye area and no where else, and it seems to help with some puffiness and fine lines, although it takes some time to see an improvement.  It includes vitamin c which is excellent for your facial skin and helps brighten my skin and keep the eye area moisturized. It also helps with the redness on my face and around my eyes.  I will continue to use.  It does seem very pricey though.	1
I've been using this product for 5-6 weeks now alongside the Obagi360 Retinol 0.5 morning and night according to directions. Initially, I had some redness right after application and some peeling on my cheeks and around the eye (you cannot use this near the eye). The results have been wonderful and beyond all expectations. I have used some high quality pricey creams and moisturizers from other brands and this is the first time I see a noticeable difference: clear skin, smoother texture and more even appearance. My face looks the best it's been in a long time! LOVE!	1
While this product didn't remove any skin dryness, but it did feel as if the skin tightened some what. The treatment definitely feels like something is working under the skin. Because my skin was still dry and peeling with this product, I had to use extra moisturizer on top of this one.	1
A bit more expensive than some other brands of sunscreen , but it works well enough and doesn't feel greasy like the cheapest brands. We used up most of this bottle this summer and were satisfied with it. I'm not sure I would purchase it again, and definitely not any time soon, as we still have plenty of other brands of sunscreen sitting in our bathroom cabinet, but - aside from the higher price - I really don't have anything negative to say about this product. We liked it and the whole family was using it this past summer.	1
The #1 reason I love this cream is that it gives great sun protection while giving a matte finish. So many other sun block products leave me so shiny and this doesn't. The 30 SPF is a good amount and it uses different ingredients to be a broad spectrum sun block. Then I like to use vitamin C serums anyway for the anti aging effects so this saves me a step. The formula is something between a cream and a serum with a light white shiny color to it. There is some light fragrance added. I have sensitive skin and I didn't have any issues with irritation. The formula is The pump bottle is easy to dispense from and keeps it fresh and air tight. Since it's 1.7 oz I can take it traveling with me or put in my purse to apply throughout the day.	1
This has a really nice texture. It is like a cream serum, almost, and it absorbs into my skin without any greasiness. It doesn't have the typical sunscreen sheen. I like it a lot. No residue and doesnt feel gunky on my skin. It provides decent protection but if you're going to be out on days with high uv, you will probably want an spf45. This spf30 has worked good for me so far, but as I get into summer and spending long days on the beach, I will need something stronger due to my melasma. I am going to look right now to see if this comes in a higher software, actually, because I really like it a lot. It doesn't make me break out, doesn't give me the little tiny white pimples like some other sunscreens do. I do not notice a scent, either. Very good all around.	1
A bit expensive for the quantity that is given, but it's a really nice sun screen. With just a couple of small dollops, it's enough to cover your entire face. It's not exactly lightweight, because I can still definitely feel it on my skin. It's not greasy, but it does provide decent moisture to my dried skin. By itself, it's probably not enough moisturizer, but it can be paired well with the Obagi Professional Serums.	1
I love at this is a spray, it makes it easier to apply where you want it and more evenly and because it's a spray there's no spillage.  It does not feel in the least greasy and it doesn't feel like there's any time for it to meld to the skin though I know with all sunscreens there's a lag time before it becomes effective.  I wish he bottle was larger for the price and that the spf was higher but it's a good product just as it is.	1
If you've stumbled across this sunscreen searching for the kind you'd find at your local store, you're probably suffering from a case of sticker shock. This sunscreen serves very specific purposes though and includes active ingredients that you won't find in $5 sunscreen bottles. This is evidenced by the fact that the sunscreen comes with an expiration date, which is allows for about 9 months of use. The bottle itself is only 1.7 ounces, so even if you live in a cold weather area, you should have no trouble going through this whole bottle over the course of a summer. I agree with other reviewers that upon initial application, you'll feel a bit of a sting, but you eventually get used to this sensation and it isn't as pronounced upon further uses. I don't wear makeup, so I can't speak to the benefits of using this over makeup, but several other reviewers have mentioned that it really is convenient to put this on over makeup. I've been very pleased so far with this beefed up bottle of sunscreen in terms of its effectiveness keeping my face safe from sunburn and would definitely recommend it to those looking for a nice anti-aging bump to boot and can afford it.	1
REVIEW OF: OBAGI PROFESSIONAL-C SUNCARE BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30  SUNSCREEN, 1.7 OZ  Obagi has a reputation for many fine skin products. This sunscreen is very light and provides a nice 'finishing' look to your overall facial appearance  The pump-up feature allows you to deliver the right intended small amount which reduces waste and over-application.  Only a small amount gives a protection aganst both UVA & UVB.  The sunscreen is light, non-greasy and feels great.  Toxicity?  Well, Obagi 's products generally have a good name and a very low toxicity rating by the Environmental Working Group; rating of a similar product is a 4  -that is pretty good. Sure, there are many less expensive sunscreens- but be careful-they might have greater toxicity. Check out that great site.  So far. this has  been well-tolerated. Worn over moisturized skin, there have been no break-outs, rashness, redness or other problems.  I hope my review is helpful for you! Thanks for your time.  RATING: 5: product 3: high cost net rating:4	1
I absolutely love Obagi products and this sunscreen lotion is no exception! It is nongreasy and light so you can apply your makeup afterwards and it will not feel heavy or oily! I used to use Peter Thomas Ross matte sunscreen but this blows it away!	1
This was the first body lotion by LOccitane (I have bought their soap bars) that I tried and I do like it a lot! Its not a thick lotion but it is effective. The small cap lifts up and the lotion comes out easily, especially in the beginning - I found that it almost pours out if Im not careful. I was on a 3 week cruise and had forgotten to bring my lotion with me. This prompted me to go to the shop on the ship to find something to use and that would soothe my sunburned skin. This was very good and it has a pleasant but not strong scent of roses. It does not take a lot of lotion to cover the entire body which justifies the price - a little goes a long way. Since Ive been home I have ordered this one from Amazon and I still have a little left of their cherry blossom body lotion left before I reorder another one. Again this is a body milk and the consistency is similar as opposed to some of the other brands of lotions - for example the ones by Molton Brown which I was using throughout the winter and is much thicker in texture.	1
I'm pretty pale, but the 10C Nude blends in with my skin pretty well. I use it as a concealer under my foundation. You can apply this by touching it to your skin, or with a brush; it'll brush on. It offers pretty full coverage. And by the time I put on foundation on top, you can't see some of the deeper blemishes any more. It feels pretty light-weight, not very heavy at all.	1
I'm a big fan of Tizo sunscreens. I have a severe sensitivity to the sun and the chemical sunscreens won't do it for me; I need zinc. The Tizos have all worked very well for me. I particularly rely on this tinted one for my face. Note that the tint isn't nearly dense enough to serve as some kind of foundation makeup; that's not its purpose. I think the tint is just to avoid that ghoulish white undertone you sometimes get with zinc sunscreens, and this succeeds very well at avoiding that. I put it on first and then go ahead and put whatever makeup or coverup I'm using right over it. Works great; I haven't broken out or burned yet!	1
I truly hate using a razor at the bikini line, and don't even get me started on a wax. This fuzz buster is a solution. It's easy to use and applies product exactly where you want it. It does seem priced a bit high for the amount in the tube however.	1
This is a nice shade that should look good on anyone at any age. I  only wish it came with some type of applicator as not everyone has their own brushes.	1
The color in the case is quite pink.  However, as tends to be the case with many types of blush, once applied the blush can be rather faint.  Of course, the purpose of blush is to be relatively faint.  Otherwise, the blush looks like clown makeup.  For application, use a large diameter, high quality makeup brush.  The brush will hold the blush adequately during transfer from makeup case to face.  As we noted above, the makeup is relatively light when applied.  We resisted the temptation to apply the blush more thickly.  For a darker or more heavy looking blush, a darker or brighter color should be used rather than glopping the blush on.  The goal is finesse, not pancake.  We are not too sure about hiding imperfections.  Frankly, the significant other has small pores, so the blush is no help there.  Indeed, the significant other has nice skin, so the primary purpose of the blush is to provide a bit of color and glow, which it does in a nice subtle way.  The significant other has tried many kinds of blush over the years, from very cheap to quite expensive.  This blush provides features similar to more expensive blushes without breaking the bank.  Yes, this blush is definitely more expensive than what the local discount store sells, but it has features more akin to the makeup found at high end department stores, at a lower price than many of the blushes sold in department stores (though not all).  Enjoy!	1
I love this product line, your face looks dewy and glowing after using the gel masks . It's very moisturizing and the effects seem to last for days afterwards.	1
Im probably as skeptical as anyone when it comes to extravagant cosmetic claims so I approached this serum with a yeah, sure attitude.  The scent reminds me of orange-glo floor cleaner but thats alright. It fades quickly. The serum comes with a dropper. It goes on with a strange greasy, oily texture but it absorbs almost instantly. It leaves my skin very smooth and make-up can be applied almost at once.  It works almost like a primer.  I have been using the serum for almost a month. I have had no adverse reaction and I have an age-spot which has gotten smaller and lighter.  Maybe coincidence, or not. I plan to use the other half of the bottle before I decide for sure if I will continue to use it but so far Im leaning in that direction.	1
Citrix Vitamin C Pro-Collagen Brightening Serum feels more like a lightweight oil than a serum to me.  It is easy to apply with the dropper lid that comes with it.  I use a couple of drops on my cheeks and a few on my forehead then rub it all in.  It is clear in color, light feeling on my skin and has a faint smell of oranges.  I appreciate the scent is light and not overpowering as I am quite sensitive to scents and have been known to stop using produces due to the smell giving me a headache.  I have dry sensitive skin and I am happy to report I have not  had any irritation or breakouts while using the Citrix.  It absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves it feeling moisturized with out feeling greasy or sticky.  I do feel that after using it nightly for the past two weeks that my skin tone appears a bit more even and my age spots appear to have faded a bit.  I have not noticed a decrease in wrinkles but my skin does feel a bit smoother.  The price tag in this would usually deter me from from this product but It dies not take much so the bottle should last me quite a long time.  I will probably end up ordering more as it is really helping to fade my age spots  and make my skin tone appear more even.	1
As most women know, there are at least three steps to a skincare regime. Mixing and matching or using just one as a stand alone product won't give you full benefit of a skincare product, since they are formulated to work with companions used during another step of the routine. With that in mind, In order to evaluate this product properly, I either purchased or requested through Vine, the other pieces.  ( Please see my review of the toner and radiant moisturizer in this MEG 21 line) I then used all three products faithfully twice a day, every day for 30 days.  I can tell you it works.  Your results may vary ( after my testing period I tended to lapse on the twice daily routine.). What I liked about this cleanser was that it was smooth and creamy without being overly oily feeling or heavily scented. It has a very faint scent, and the pump bottle is designed for easy use without contaminating the product.  It cleaned thoroughly without making my skin feel tight and rinsed off easily, it left no residue behind.  I avoided my eye area, but didn't encounter any irritating if it got on my lids while I rinsed. I highly recommend this.	1
I'm 33 with oily, and acne prone skin. My acne is currently under control, but none the less, new products can sometimes cause a problem. First, I'll say that I was rather frustrated to not be able to find the ingredients to this product online, either here on Amazon, nor on the MEG21 website (atleast at the time of writing this review). Had I been able to see the ingredients I don't think I would have purchased. I will type them out at the bottom of this review.  Although I have oily skin, I have had good luck with cream cleansers in the past, and so wanted to give this a try. I have read about sugar damaging the skin/collagen, causing free radicals, etc, and so their marketing appealed to me. Upon first use, I was immediately taken aback by the fragrance. This is a highly fragranced product. The scent is hard to describe, but it's sort of like a 'spa smell' that is also fruity. Looking at the ingredient list, "fragrance" is the last ingredient, but there is also orange, lemon, tangerine, and rosemary essential oil. If you read up on skincare at all, then you probably know that fragrance and citrus oils are frowned upon in skincare products as being damaging/irritating to the skin.  Despite the fragrance, I continued using it because I don't like to waste things. I figured I'd use it up and just not purchase in the future. Well, after a week of use, my skin seemed very dry. Still oily, but with dry flaky skin. I found this very odd, because typically cream cleansers are moisturizing and the product description says it's hydrating. Well, again, looking at the product ingredients, I see that high on the ingredient list is 'fruit extracts', 'sugar cane extracts' and 'sugar maple extracts', these ingredients act like glycolic acid and salicylic acid, which of course are chemical exfoliants and can cause flaking skin. This is fine if you are looking for an exfoliating cleanser, except the product seems to be marketed as 'gentle', 'moisturizing', and for sensitive skin.  Ingredient list:  water, ppg-3 benzyl ether , myristate, glycerin, polysorbate 20, peg-8, dimethicone, soap bark extract, soapwort root extract, vaccinium myrtillus fruit/leaf extract, sugar cane extract, sugar maple extract, orange fruit extract, lemon extract, betaine, sodium pca, sorbitol, serin, glycine, glutamic, acid, alanine, lysine, arginine, threonine, profile, tangerine oil, rosemary oil, peg-40, hydrogenated castor oil, trideceth-9, acrylates/c10-30, alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, panthenol, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol, frangrance.	-1
I've been using this Moisturizing Cleanser for several weeks with good results. I do not have sensitive skin and am not prone to breakouts, so did not experience any side effects from daily us of this cleanser. I like the fresh, clean scent since I do not like heavily scented creams on my face, particularly at night. I wash my face just before going to bed with this cleanser, but it does not moisturize my very dry skin enough so I still have to apply another moisturizer. I do find the cleanser a bit watery if applied per instructions which specify adding water. If I do that, it just drips out of my hands before I can even apply it to my face. So I just pump a squirt into my hands, smooth it onto my face, rinse off and towel dry. I also find it a bit annoying that one has to avoid eye contact with a facial cleanser. I can't get my face completely clean with just one product if I can't get it near my eyes.	1
This is a nice, gentle skin cleanser with just the right amount of moisturizer for my morning regimen - not too heavy, but keeps my skin feeling smooth and supple.  There is only the slightest scent to it - I only notice it when I'm washing, it doesn't seem to linger at all!	1
When you have older skin ( I am 60) the line between really clean and overdrying is very slim. Older skin is less resilient and prone to be far more fragile than when younger. I really like the product. I've been using it for days and my skin feels in that sweet zone of clean but not tight and drawn. The product does not really lather but you mix it with water in your hand to cleanse. The scent to me is like the shore and is refreshing ( and like home to this Jersey girl). I love the container with its dispenser cover and careful pump.  I'm sold. I'll be buying it when this container runs out. Very pleased.	1

Your results may vary ( after my testing period I tended to lapse on the twice daily routine.). What I liked about this toner was that it was applied by spritzing it on the skin, the blotting excess off.  It has a very faint scent, and the bottle is designed for easy use. It was nondrying and pleasantly refreshing, leaving my skin tighter and smoother. I highly recommend this.	1
I am loving this toner. Before I received it, I was not a toner user. I was using MEG 21 Smooth Radiance Face Treatment, but I had not seen results. Now that I am using the toner and the treatment together, I am seeing real results. My skin appears to be creating new collagen just as the scientists behind the MEG 21 products said it would. Although I still have wrinkles (close to 70 years with lots of sun exposure over the decades), my skin looks more vibrant and youthful and smoother. The toner is a pleasure to use in every way. I like it better than the MEG 21 Smooth Radiance Face Treatment, although my guess is that they are more effective used together.  My one concern is that my skin has responded with so much youthful exuberance that I've developed a few pimples. Gross. I am now using a little salicylic acid treatment to counteract that unwanted development and it's working well. So, I give this toner 5 stars because it adds a glow and revitalizes my skin in a way I didn't think was even possible.	1
I have been looking for a toner that won't dry my already dry skin out even more.  This does a great job of reducing pores and leaves my skin feeling fresh and ready to accept lotion.  I have tried everything from Chanel to Clinique to drug store brands and so far this is one of the better toners I have used.  The major difference in this toner is that it contains arnica and calendula and these ingredients really help reduce the redness in my skin.  I always look for calendula in products since I know it really does help reduce inflammation.  It feels very soothing and refreshing.  There is a strong scent of rosemary but that goes away quickly.  This has not caused any reactions for my dry, sensitive skin.	1
I am a licensed esthetician and always on a lookout for good products.  Toner is a must have part of the skin regimen every morning and night. I was curious about this product because it contains ingredient called supplamine.  Enzyme This called F3K (implicated in diabetic kidney disease and kidney cancer) , produces toxic sugars in the body. These toxic sugars activate the inflammation pathway. In skin, inflammation causes all sorts of problems, including premature aging.  While studying this disease pathway in cancer patients, researches discovered an ingredient that stops this F3K enzyme. By chance, they found that this ingredient also exerts the same beneficial action in skin. This now patented ingredient, called Supplamine, is the magic ingredient for treating glycation!  Glycation refers to sugar attaching to collagen or elastin (both are proteins).  Glycated collagen collapses the dermal matrix (Extracellular Matrix), which is an important support system in the dermis. When it collapses, it reduces the volume of the fluid in the dermis bathing the collagen and elastin. This fluid is a gel made up of water, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins. The gel gives skin its turgidity and plumpness.  With there is less volume of this gel, there is less water in skin. Skin becomes less plump and moist. The result of glycated collagen on your skin? Wrinkles, sagging, less firmness, and sallow to Supplamine is one of the main ingredients of MEG21 Toner product.  In addition to Supplamine ingredient, thsi  product has a ton of antioxidants, fruit extracts such as: cranberry, orange, lemon, and tangerine as well as sugar cane, sugar maple, arnica, camellia and lavender.  Base of the product is water and witch hazel.  Product is saturated with all good things for one's skin.  Bottle has a spritzer and originally I intended to use it as a mist.  But I found out that the spray is too heavy when prayed directly in the face and too much of a product is being wasted.  So instead, I apply toner on a small cotton pad and apply it on the face.  It has lovely faint fragrance which probably comes from lavender and white flowers.  Toner is light, moisturizing and very refreshing.  But I noticed that even though I use it after cleansing the skin, toner still picks up any remaining dirt form the skin which is definitely an added plus.  When applied by cotton on a face, product absorbs quickly so one can easily move on to applying serum and cream afterwards.  This is great product for skin's cellular repair.  To learn more about it and the research that took to create a product you can visit [...].  Product is real gem and I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone.	1
Well, I really wish I could say this was everything I had hoped but I seem to be allergic to it. When I tried it my skin felt like it was on fire. My face turned red and burned until  I rinsed it for about 10 minutes & it stopped. I certainly wasn't refreshing for me. My daughter tried it and it didn't have the same effect on her so obviously it's most likely ok for most people. But from my own point of view this was not a pleasurable experience.  Hopefully it will be good for you.	-1
This seems like a great, refreshing toner. It disperses nicely from the spray bottle and it feels good going on my skin. A few spritzes go a long way. It leaves my skin feeling soft and moist after application. It has a rather unique fragrance, not unpleasant and not great neither. Fortunately for me, it doesn't linger. The toner is supposed to help refine and improve skin appearance due to aging. However, the jury is still out. I haven't seen any noticeable improvement yet. At any rate, I'll continue to use it since I like how refreshing it is. Other than the so-so scent, it's worth a try.	1
I have the MEG cleanser and was anxious to try this in my face care regime. It is refreshing without being drying. I like it quite a bit. It comes in a spray bottle which I use to put on a cotton round. I've noticed some tightening of pores and a smoothing of my overall complexion.  I had read some reviews regarding fragrance. I've got a good nose but I could not discern my scent at all from this product ....and I tried. The cleanser has a pleasant scent but I could not pick up anything at all from the toner.  This will be a price sensitive item for me; I'll have to like it a whole lot and for the entire bottle to spend that much. Right now I am on the fence re: staying with this toner. I like it well enough so we'll see.	1
Literally the best eye mask on the market. Immediate results I love Juice beauty	1
With all the complaints in these reviews about how difficult and messy application is, I expected the worst. What I found, instead, was completely fine! But let me start with the results. I'm an extreme skeptic about eye treatments in general, because I think they cost a lot for results I don't really see. I genuinely was not expecting much from this one either, but when I took off the tissue, the results were dramatic. I have olive skin and am prone to puffiness and darkness around my eyes. This eye treatment made the area around my eyes dramatically better. I took before and after pictures just to be sure I wasn't imagining it. The effect seems to last for at least a few hours.  Now in terms of the application, it seems to me that the product designers had this challenge of how to put the serum that they know works under the eyes for a period of time. Tissue paper itself would probably disintegrate while a sponge material wouldn't stay in place on your face. They came up with what feels a bit like rice paper. When you see it in the package, it looks much sturdier and more sponge-like than it is. I accidentally nicked off a piece of one because I didn't realize how fragile it was. But it really is the perfect vehicle for the liquid. I don't see how it is hard to apply, like others have said. You just pour a bit on to saturate and then put it under your eyes. And that's where you can see the application really works. When you put it on your face, it looks like how you'd imagine putting a wet tissue on your face would look. It holds to your face completely. Is it a liquid? Yes, so you need to pour it while standing over a sink, but that's not a big deal. And you want to be careful not to pour too much over just the first pad. But they give you plenty for both eyes in a vial. And with practice, I imagine being able to conserve enough for two applications per vial. But of course, I wouldn't have enough of those cool rice paper pads. The serum has no smell and is not sticky. It has the consistency of water.  The price, of course, is the downside. It's about $12/treatment. But for events, or for days where you wake up looking awful, yes. This stuff is worth it.	1
It seems like most of these sorts of products require consistent use and I find that easy and pleasant to use products are the ones that I do use regularly and purchase more than just that first, hopeful transaction.  I enjoy a few of Juice Beauty's other products, especially the sensitive peel, but the Instant Eye Lift will not be a likely "must have" anytime soon.  Pros:  it did have nearly instant (next morning) results.  It seemed to temporarily improve the hyper pigmentation under my eyes (where that skin meets my cheeks).  My eyes appeared brighter and I looked Less drained and exhausted.  I enjoyed pouring the liquid onto the pads.  I'm a nerd and it felt a bit like a science experiment.  Cons: So drippy and cold.  This was not a pleasant sensory experiment and it was distracting to use while watching TV.  The liquid went everywhere. The price tag is a bit hefty. The directions are not clear.  I didn't know if I was supposed to leave it on or rinse it off when it was done.  I opted for rinsing it off, just to be safe.  This was just not the fresh, yet luxurious experience I typically look forward to with Juice Beauty products.	-1
The biggest problem with this product is the delivery system. It was so bad I can't tell if the product works or not because I don't know if it was applied correctly.  First the solution is packed in, I assume, one application sizes. But there is no control for getting the solution out, so it pours out quickly, not allowing the user to spread the mixture out all over the pads.  Second the pads had so many problems. They are made from paper that while appearing to be pretty thick and absorbent isn't. It can't soak up the solution. One pad separated into layers, the other tore apart.  In spite of these problems I applied the pads under my eyes. The solution was cold, never warming, and uncomfortable.  I was not impressed.	-1
This is a good product, easy to use, enjoyable. The results are quite limited but dark circles under one's eyes cannot be "repaired" from the outside anyway.  People have complained in the reviews that it is difficult to soak the pads in liquid without the pads becoming impossible to pick up and apply under one's eyes. These problems arise only when you dump an entire bottle of liquid onto a pad. Don't do that. Instead, apply a drop of liquid to the pad, wait for it to soak in and spread, then apply the second drop, etc. Usually, you don't even need an entire bottle to soak the pads to the point where they will be very easy to lift and apply to your face.  Applying the liquid to the pads and the pads to your under-eye area is supposed to be a slow, relaxing process. If you try to rush it, it won't work. The creators of the product did a very smart thing in ensuring that the process of applying the liquid to the pads requires tranquility and concentration. Many people forget that the #1 rule to get facial care products to work is to relax. And once you finally manage to stop rushing around, relax and stop worrying about everything else you need to be doing instead of indulging yourself, that already will be way more useful to your skin than any product.	1
I'm kinda jaded on 'eye lift' promise in a bottle.  Except, after using it for 2 weeks ... it works or looks like it does. It's a thin, quick absorbing compound. It's a bit tedious to get the application down. Best to precut the pads to fit. All things considered, it reduced eye puffiness and wrinkle release was noticed after a week. Good stuff. Worth the price. Enjoy!	1
I usually buy the eyeliner that twists up because I find it's easier to apply then the pencils that need to be sharpened, but I was pleasantly surprised by this Vincent Longo waterproof eye pencil! It applied cleanly and easily and didn't seem to break at random points during sharpening (a really huge pet peeve of mine!). It also lasted a super long time, which I also find to be an issue with many old-school pencils. Definitely recommend!	1
I'm surprisingly impressed with this pencil. It's easy to apply, smudges when you ask it to, doesn't when you don't and is a wonderful color. It's lightweight and without texture so you can't feel it after it's been applied. It does a wonderful job opening up my eyes without making me look gothic. The brown is a great contrast to my dark brown with highlights hair.	1
I wear eyeliner every day, and have been using a powder with a brush for years. I keep trying out different waterproof liners because they last longer but have had a hard time finding one that goes on smoothly.  Most of the time, I just can't keep my hand steady enough and I end of having an uneven line - thank goodness for eye make up remover or I would look like a drunk raccoon. LOL  This pencil is the best waterproof liner I've tried. It went on easily, with a nice fine line and I didn't even mess it up. Nice color, lasted all day and is recommended!	1
A very nice rich brown that stands out with brown eyes. It creates an easy, smokey look for day or night. Normally I use black, but this was almost as useful and basic.	1
I am now a huge fan of Vincent Longo products. Channel used to be my go-to brand, but now, I have found that Longo's products out perform them. This eye pencil is amazing.  After using a bit of shadow base on my eye lid, I use this eye pencil to line my eyes and it blends super easily.  I then apply the rest of my eye shadow.  Also, it doesn't melt off in the heat.  You do need to use an oil based remover to get it off, but it only takes one wipe to remove it completely.  I have sensitive skin and have a real problem especially around my eyes with products that flake off and cause irritation.  After using this daily for about two weeks, I haven't experienced that.	1
Very foamy, that's for sure. I've never used a foaming shower gel (just the normal kind that requires lathering to foam). One small pump and I had more foam than I knew what to do with. It is kind of fun, but I can't tell if there is any other point to it. It smells nice and feels good on my skin, but isn't much different from my normal shower gel.	1
I didn't know what to expect since I've never used a 'shower foam' before but I love this product and caught my husband using it too. It's very unique! It dispenses much like my foamy sunblock does, like a thick whipped cream. The scent is really delicious, it reminds me of spa products I've used over the years from high-end brands like JE Atkinson. It is definitely scented with essential oils rather than synthetic fragrance. My skin is super dry due to medical issues but this product gives my skin an appropriate level of moisture thanks to the almond oil that's in it. In fact, my skin feels so soft and sweetly scented, this has become my all-time favorite shower cleanser. It's truly an indulgence to use and has a very calming quality about it. My skin feels very clean without the Ph being stripped away. If you love spa products (vs those purchased in the drug store), you'll love this too....it's divine!  So divine, in fact, I caught my hubby using it recently. Highly recommended unless you're a Mr Bubble fan.	1
This is a foam cleanser, but is not exactly like other leading foam cleansers. It does not pump out in a foam form like some competitors. Rather, it squirts our like a gel stream and lathers when you rub it on your body. It reminds me more of shaving gel but it lathers to a soap instead of staying a cream. You only need a little bit but it does squirt out fast. Also I couldn't make it squirt at first because i was pushing directly down on the nozzle. Instead you have to push at an angle on the back portion of the top. The smell is great! I really like to use it at the gym where I don't have loofahs or wash cloths. Its easy to apply with hands only.	1
Wow, this foaming shower gel was a surprise. It REALLY squirts out! A quick press and release shoots out enough of this gel to shower nicely and get you clean. The fragrance is strong and lasts so keep that in mind. My first mistake was pressing it down and having a lot come out...I learned quickly. It washes off easily and didn't leave any kind of film.	1
This gel comes out like shaving gel: fast and foams quickly.  So be a bit careful when you first use because I ended up spraying out way too much.  But once I mastered dispensing the right amount, had a great experience with this product.  The scent is faint but pleasant.  And thought it is faint, you can still smell it on you when sniff your skin closely at the ens of the day.  It also kept my skin hydrated all day.  I have never tried foaming shower gel before but this is better than any soap bar or body wash I have ever tried before.	1
This is a lovely eye shadow for those who want a subtle color on their eyes, something that will not bowl you over. It's a little too light for my skin, however. Probably it would work better with a slightly darker complexion.	1
First, the packaging is so on point. It really has a luxe look about it. Its nice how big this compact is, no wasted spaced here! I experienced no fallout with this shade, it was just very silky smooth to apply. I'm a pale redhead, and in the photos, I show off a hand swatch and an EOTD with this eyeshadow. It's like my skin, but shimmery. I found the quality to be very good, but of course, you're paying $18 for one eyeshadow, for .05 oz of product. Is this something I personally would spend the money on? I probably would not as I prefer to splurge on palettes (when I get the chance to splurge).	1
Shade 03 is absolutely amazing. Long wearing, truly velvety in texture, richly pigmented, and very versatile. Not only do I love it as an eye shadow but I've been using it as a highlighter too. I would definitely recommend this to a friend in the market for a high-end shadow product that has many uses and is worth the higher price tag.	1
I wear eye shadow only for special occasions, but this is much nicer than the cheap stuff I usually buy. It comes in a lovely little solid compact with a mirror, but no brush. It went on smoothly and evenly and was very long lasting. I would have preferred a darker shade; this is a pale beige shade, good for highlighting under the brow. The one problem with matte powder shadows like this is that they tend to make eyelids on us older people look crepey, and this is no exception. But it still a very nice product.	1
A bit darker than I expected, but still beautiful! I only recently discovered this line and have purchased the eye pencils after reading the reviews. I recommend them too!	1
Japonesque is now my favorite lipstick.  It goes on very smoothly and evenly, and it lasts a lot longer than most of my other lipsticks.  I was afraid the color would be too dark for my fair skin, but it looks great.  It has moisturizers and it actually feels more like lip balm than lipstick.  No dry feeling from this product.  I really do think it makes my lips look fuller.  I have rather thin lips anyway and with this lipstick, they look a lot better.  The tip is beveled which allows for cleaner edges.  I'm not sure that the bevel will last with continued use, but so far it's been great.  I really like this product, but I'm not sure I will buy it again as $20 is a lot for a tube of lipstick.  However, if you can afford it, then this is a great lipstick.	1
Since I have green eyes, I like to use purple and pink eyeshadow to enhance them, so I ordered this eyeshadow duo in Shade 06. (For reference, I normally use Tarte eyeshadows, which I love.) The colors are pretty, but I will not buy from this company again. First of all, the compact is very tiny. That may be a plus for travel or to tuck into a small handbag, but then you would also need a brush or applicator because the duo does not include one. Secondly, the product goes on very light, and you have to keep building it up, which takes a lot of time. The pink makes a nice highlighter for under the brow bone, but the purple is barely visible. You have to get your brush wet to get any color to show up. Third, the case is very difficult to open. You have to get your nail under the catch and risk breaking or cracking a nail. For a little more money, I could buy a Tarte eyeshadow quad and get twice as many colors with a much better quality. This product is more comparable to a drugstore duo than a higher end brand. I don't think it's worth the cost.	-1
My daughter is a fan of this brand of makeup, she prefers it over most brands.  The colors go on as they appear in the photo without needing to use large amounts.  They are not greasy feeling, and clean off easily with normal makeup removers.  The price is rather high compared to most brands though.  A little does go a long way with these colors, and especially this brand since not as much is required when compared to others.	1
I absolutely love applying eye shadow. I like to think of my eyelids as a blank canvas where I can express my creativity. So when I had the chance to try this product, I jumped at it. With that being said, I have to say I am rather disappointed. There is very little pigmentation and the colors are matte which makes it appear dull. Moreover, not that it is a deal breaker for me, but buyers need to know that applicators are not included so if you do purchase this product be sure you have your own applicator.	-1
I am seeing this brand more often in the stores.  So far I have been very impressed with the Japonesque brand.  They offer a higher end products that are on bar with well known names here such as Make Up Forever, Urban Decay, and MAC.  So this is something much nicer than you would normally get in a drug store.  The packaging is a big plus, a very nicely decorated case that is study.  So you can feel like the product won't break or crack in the package should you put it in your purse to carry around.  I think this is a big plus.  I have the purple shade number 06.  I thought the colors were very nice, and very wearable for most for either the office or  evening.  The texture is a soft and buttery and they blend very well.  I wasn't in love with the pigmentation.  I always wear eye shadow with a primer and these lasted from 6 am in the morning until 10 pm when I washed them off at night.  This compact really does a nice job at giving you a great day look.  If you want something more intense I think you may need to enhance it with additional colors.  While the quality and lasting power of this shadows is amazing, the pigmentation leaves something to be desired.	1
I love the two toned power choices, a light tone for the brow bone and a darker purple for your  eyelid.  Usually I use Loreal or Cover Girl.  As a mother and career woman I used to think the I didn't deserve to use money towards my looks.  After a time though, I realized splurging a little for quality makeup is OK,  I am not sure if they carry this brand where I live but of course it is just a click away  Granted,, I received this through the Vine program but this is the third product of theirs I have received and used and have been quite pleased with the blush and base.	1
Not super impressed with this product. For the price, I expected better color pigmentation and longer staying power. You can get better formulas at the drugstore for a fraction of the price.	-1
My wife loved this eye shadow. She said the color was as vibrant when she took it off at night as it was first thing in the morning when she put it on. So yes, it looks good throughout the day.  The eyeshadow is not greasy, does not smudge, and stays on all day long. The case is small, and easy to open. All in all, this is a great eyeshadow and she looks forward to trying other colors, although I think purple looks the best with her eye color (brown).	1
Wife's review:  This mascara is really nice and doesn't clump or flake off. It extended my lashes quite a bit without them looking spidery. The brush large but still easy to use.  My one complaint is that it doesn't add a lot of bulk to my lashes so I didn't use it as a stand alone mascara. I paired it with the Mary Kay mascara for a nice result.	1
Some characteristics:  *This isn't a super dark black though Japonesque calls it shade 01 which I assume indicates their darkest color.  *Its not overly wet which cuts back on smears and helps it brush on lightly.  Youll find you need at least two coats but most of us do at least that many layers already.  Best of all the relative dryness keeps it from clumping due to over application.  *It dries quickly so theres not a lot of wait time between applications and allows you to use our eyelash curler in a more timely way so you can get out of the house in the morning.  *I purposely rubbed my eyes after the mascara had completely dried and there was no smearing either above or below my eyes.  *This mascara has a minimal neutral smell.  *Washes off quickly and thoroughly.  *The one possible negative to this product is that due to its relative dryness and depending on the look you're trying to achieve you might need up to three coats.	1
It looks great, natural, and creates a smooth and consistent facial tone.  My skin color is white/Caucasian somewhere between darker ivory and light beige or Maybelline foundation color 5 and 10 It is a little bit greasy going on, but when its on feels great.  It comes with a little plastic scoop which Ive been using to dig it out.  Then I apply it with my hands like a moisturizer.  Its too thick to brush on, a sponge might work.	1
I like this pencil. it applies easily with no tugging or pulling and as another reviewer pointed out sharpens easily. I am going back for the 01 which is the darker black. On my monitor at home this appears to be a 'brown/black'. Not so. This is a softer black like a very dark gray color. I apply this over my top lash line and then use a skinny liquid liner right along the lash line. This is great when you have very sparse lashes. I personally don't use dark pencils on my lower lashes because I tend to 'raccoon' after a few hours. Instead I use a softer shade like a burgundy or taupe and still get a bit of definition. Update: got my 01 pencil - yes, it is dark, dark black and yes, I will be using it. Glad I found this brand and will be trying some of their other products.	1
This liner goes on very smoothly with no pulling or dragging on my eyelid, so I'm able to make lines that are evenly colored, without the skipping that I get with other liners. It goes on so easily, it's comparable to liquid liner, but easier to control. It lasts all day on my upper lids, but I did have some smearing on the lower lids. Tip: If you live in a colder climate, it will help to warm it up a bit with your hands before you use it.	1
I enlisted my lovely assistant, my wife, to help me review the Japonesque Eye Defining Pencil.  I liked the way it looked on her, but apparently the critical thing is how it goes on and feels. so here's what she said:  "This eyeliner went on very smoothly and didn't pull at my eyes. I got a nice smooth line that was also very easy to smudge out for a smokey look. I forgot that I had it on and I wasn't tempted to rub or poke at my eyes even by the end of the day. It does last all day, still nice and dark late at night, but it was easy to remove with a little eye cream. This pencil won't end up at the bottom of the drawer."	1
This eye liner is my new favorite, goes on really smooth and easy to control.  Lasts for hours, I certainly recommend giving it a try.	1
I don't wear lipstick very often but on occasion. This is a lot pinker than I was expecting. Also, it is thick so it does not apply as easy. For example you can't just paint it on. I usually put a little on my bottom lip and than spread it on my rubbing my two lips together than. I than cover it with a little darker shade of lipstick to keep it from making me look like I got into kool aid or something.	-1
Amazingly creamy yet long lasting.  Loved the was my lips feel.  The brush really is different and I had to practice before I felt confident.  The 04 shade works wonderfully for my light complexion.  As a am an RN I must look professional under harsh lighting in an extremely dry environment.  This met and surpassed all my criteria.  Also as a "mature" women I didn't feel twenty years too late for the prom.  This will definitely be on my Christmas list for myself and my friends.  Highly recommend!	1
I really liked the creamy, non-sticky texture of this lip gloss.  It almost felt like painting my lips with buttercream frosting, without the sweetness.  It does feel very moisturizing and I think it makes my lips feel a little softer, especially in winter when wearing lipstick sometimes makes my lips feel dry.  The color didn't thrill me out of the tube, I usually prefer something with a little sparkle and this was a pale pink without the slightest hint of shimmer but once applied and rubbed in it gave my lips a flattering natural flush.  And I do mean rub it in.  I found it looked best when I applied a small amount (scrape the brush on the inside of the bottle so you leave at least half the product behind) and then either rubbed my lips together or patted my finger gently over my lips or used a lip brush to brush out the product.  If you apply too much it seems to just sit on top of your lips and look unnatural.  The only real downside is that it doesn't last very long.  I applied it before taking my dogs for an hour walk where I neither drank, ate or really spoke with anyone else and my lips were bare looking when I got home.  And no, I'm not a lip licker.  My other lip glosses/lip sticks look pretty much like I just applied them when I get home from my walks.  So, to get around this issue I apply a pink lip stain underneath the gloss so my lips don't look bare and washed out when it wears off.  Bottom line, I like the texture but wish it had more staying power and since it's not just a "sweep and go" kind of lipstick on me, I usually don't bother carrying it around in my purse to use when I'm on the go.	1
Never heard of Japonesque, so the first thing I did was check into the history behind the name. Turns out Japonesque was inspired by the famous Kabuki theater in Japan. Japonesque makes quality professional make-up tools, and bright, bold, theatrical colorful makeup products.  I absolutely love this lip lacquer. Shade 04 is a bright pinkish/red creamy dream, that stays on like no other lipstick. I'm fair skinned with green eyes, and strawberry blond hair, and this shade brightens my face, without looking overdone. It goes on with precision due to the wonderful brush wand. During the day, I like to blot with a tissue after applying, at night it's full gorgeous color. Either way, this lipstick continues to be creamy, no stickiness at all, and it lasts through drinks, food, and loads of talking. To top it all off, it's nourishing, as my lips stay wonderfully hydrated with no drying affects at all.  Nice little flash of design/color on the top of the tube. Great lipstick!	1
When I ordered this lip gloss/lip lacquer, I was mistaken about the color. This was not the right shade for me. I have an olive complexion and this was way too pink. So, I loaned it to her friend, and this review is based on her feedback sprinkled with a little of my own. When asked, the following were her responses:  1. Color? Did you like the color, and what skin tones would you recommend for it? I liked the color, but think that (Shade 04) would go best with fair skin tones. I would not recommend it for olive or brown complexions. [I agree, I have an olive to cinnamon complexion, and this was not a good color for me. It looked like I dipped my lips in a shade that was between "pepto bismol" and cotton candy. That may be an exaggeration, but you get my drift. But when my friend put it on (and she is fair with red hair no doubt), it was perfect. It merely accentuated her features, and didn't exaggerate them.  2. How long does the color last? It lasted for several hours, and I was pleased with longevity. This product does stain the lips slightly.  3. How did it feel when applied? It has a wonderful, creamy texture. It is easy to apply, but a little messy. It runs a bit, and it is kind of difficult to correct errors (because it does stain), so be careful when applying.  4. Did you notice any difficulties while wearing this product? No, with the exception of it being a little sticky. If the wind is blowing, my hair does occasionally get caught in it and will occasionally drag the color across my face.  5. Does it have an unpleasant taste or smell? Nope and nope.  6. What did you think of the packaging? No complaints. The container is basic but attractive (clear with a black top). You can see the color better in person than on-line.  7. Would you pay $20 for it? Well, $20 is a little steep. I'd probably pay $10.  8. How would you compare the quality of this product to others that you can buy in the mall or the drug store?  I think its higher quality than most drug stores (lasts longer and nicer packaging), but not as nice as the mall stuff (i.e., the stickiness of it and it runs).  Overall, we both give the Japonesque (Shade 4) Lip Lacquer 4 out of 5 stars.	1
Shade 02 is a great set of neutral colors, great for every day. The shimmer colors are pretty sheer, but can layer for more color. Blend easily. Long lasting. Feels like very high quality eyeshadows.	1
Japonesque Velvet Touch Shadow Palette is one of the best eye shadows I have used.  I have very sensitive skin and usually stick to MAC cosmetics.  I decided to venture out and try something new.  Japonesque was perfect for my sensitive skin!  The shadow itself goes on smoothly and evenly.  In addition, it is long lasting and did not irritate my eyes, even when wearing contact lenses and dealing with seasonal allergies.  The best thing about the palette (in shade 02) is the richness of the colors.  Each is complimentary of one another and though they are in the same color group, the palette provides plenty of variety.  The biggest downside is the price.  While it is comparable to many brands found in higher end department stores, I usually would not spend this much for a shadow palette.  However, I would consider splurging on this one once in a while because of the quality.	1
I wasn't sure if I was going to like the colors as I tend to were more grey and blue shades, but I loved them. The color goes on smooth and you don't need a heavy application to get good coverage. I love that I can apply lightly and just highlight my eyes or do a heavy application for a more intense look.  The lighter shades can also be used to highlight check bones as well. Overall, I'm really happy with this brand and shade palette.	1
The colors in this palette are fantastic! The shadow goes on smoothly and creates a beautiful shimmer on my eyelids. It's good for both everyday wear and going out for the evening. I will buy this brand again.	1
This is really nice. The eye shadow feels so soft and smooth. I love the colors and you will have fun blending up new designs with them. There's something in them that sparkles just enough to draw attention to your eyes. It really does make your eyes sparkle and look attractive. It also has a nice case and it would be a shame to throw it away when you are done with the eye shadow. I hope they will just be selling the inserts by that time so it can be changed out. Nice product, very good quality.	1
This palette of shadows contains four neutral colors that can be used to design a full eye look. Three of the shades have shimmer, the darkest shade is more matte.  I tested these shades without using a primer underneath so that I could test how well these shadows performed without the boost from a primer.  My skin is normal but can lean slightly oily and cheaper shadows will often crease during the course of a day.  These shadows applied easily and blended very well.  Over the course of the day, the color held up very well and there was only a small amount of creasing of the color.  With a primer, I noticed no creasing.  The shades themselves were pretty and suitable for daily wear.  This palette comes with a mirror but no brush.  The case is sturdy and beautiful. Overall, a nice palette for daily wear.	1
I usually end up spending a significant amount of money on my facial products, especially my moisturizers and night creams.  On the other hand,  I have found there to be little difference between  eye shadows.  Over the years, I have used Almay, L'oreal, Clinique, Estee Lauder and Lancome products, with the much cheaper Almay and L'oreal providing better coverage and selections.  Japonesque Velvet Touch Eye Shadow Palette will cost you $34.00 dollars, which is on the expensive side.  I did feel, however that this was an excellent eye shadow, which was packaged exquisitely.  You could easily give them as gifts.  If I happen to drop this compact on the floor, which I have unfortunately done in the past,  it probably would not shatter as others have done.  In addition, comparing the 4 different brands that I had at home ( Clinque, Almay,  L'oreal and Lancome) you get at least 50% more shadow for your money with Japonesque Velvet Touch.  I was comparing the shadow quad with all four brands.  I was sent the (D'OMBRES A PAUPIERES) which is listed as 02.  The quad consists of 4 colors in the brown/gold family.  Two of the color choices had more of a shimmery look.  You can apply the shadow lightly or put it on in layers for a more dramatic look.  I felt that you needed to apply at least 2 layers before the nuances of the color became apparent.  This compact did not come with an applicator, which was unusual, however, not a concern for me, as I usually use my fingertips.  I thought the shadow glided smoothly across my lids, crease and brow area.  The choice of colors appeared perfect for each of those areas and I was pleased with the final result.  Did the shadow last any longer than the $8.99 drugstore brands, probably not.  I would recommend this product and would consider other colors in the blue or green family.	1
Great finishing powder, however be aware it is not a "translucent" color it will definitely lighten when its applied.  It sets everything so nicely and holds makeup nicely.  I use a lot of moisturizers before putting on liquid foundation which can make it feel like one touch will smudge it away.  This stuff really helps set it all in place and adhere to my skin quickly.  Great to use even for under eye highlight if used a lot, or a soft dusting for setting.  Versatile product and its a lot.  Perfect to carry for touch ups during the day if you need to deshine.	1
This was slightly light for me but still usable. I have a foundation that is slightly darker than I like and this makes a good cover for it.  I have dark under eye circles and use a moderate amount of product to cover them. This finishing powder sets the concealer very well and I find so long as I don't touch under my eyes that they stay good for hours. With some other powders I've tried, I might have to do the tap, tap with my fingertips to redistribute my concealer from time to time during the day and so far, I've not had to do that when using this.  I've had this compact for some months now and a little goes a long way I've found so it lasts a long time for me. I like the compact too. It's sturdy and attractive. I would buy this in the future.	1
While I really like this product overall, it's not what you'd call a heavy duty primer. This primer by Japonesque is mostly an illuminating base that can be worn under foundation or can also stand on it's own as a product that brings out a healthy glow. That said, it's really only going to give a healthy glow for those with fair skin. Those with darker skin I think may find that this is really best only used under other makeup, as a primer. It has a lightening effect, which I really like since I'm fair skinned, but others won't.  It smooths on nicely, and the bottle is a decently large size considering that a little goes a long way with this product. It has a shimmery look which can help make dry skin like mine look fresh and dewy. On the other hand, I'm not sure this is my favorite primer. While it's a nice fresh, illuminating base, it doesn't have that silicone feel my other primers have had. I've also noticed this product doesn't make makeup stay put the way my other primers have. So if you're looking for a good fresh base--whether it is to stand alone or to go under makeup--this is good, just don't expect this to be one of those primers that makes your makeup invincible throughout the day.  Again, with this product a little goes a long way. It is also scent free, which I like. It has not caused any breakouts or rashes. I would definitely try other products from this brand. Any questions? Leave a comment and I'll do my best to answer!	1
Its been awhile since Ive used primer and I thought Id give this Japonesque one a try. Its not kidding when it says its radiant. Its white and pearly and its like a layer of small bits of glitter are all over my skin. If I don't use much make up over it, its like Im glowing.  I have freckles and some uneven color on my skin and I was hoping this primer would help even out my skin tone. It doesnt really do much in that respect and I rely on my regular make up still, but it makes my foundation look better for longer. I don't feel so desperate to wash my face at the end of the day like I sometimes do without the primer.  It only takes a little bit of the primer to cover my face and this bottle will last a long time. It has a little pump to get it out of the bottle, which Im a big fan of to prevent bacteria from getting into the jar. I think thats really important for make up I intend to use for more than a month or so like this one.	1
This face primer is excellent! I have oily/dry combination skin, and this product doesn't come off or cause my skin to flake. It leaves my skin with a smooth finish and lasts for hours. I do have to mention that the shimmer is a bit much but it doesn't ruin the consistency of the primer at all. I love how a small amount goes a long way. Definitely a must in anyone's makeup collection!	1
a great scent and not overbearing.	1
It smells good...... woodsy and musky.  My wife likes it, but says it smells like lots of other, similar scents.  Sort of Drakkar-ish.... as she put it: "It's not like I would recognize it for its distinctive smell."	1
This sunscreen is very thick and will cover you thoroughly! It can be used on arms, legs, even your face if you want it too. This is an effective product.	1
I have been using Nia 24 without issue.  Other reviewers have stated it leaves a white film or causes a rash, I have not experienced either of those.  I do have darker skin and I don't have issues with sensitive skin.  The product protects my skin from the strong sun we have at higher altitude here in the West.  While I have not had any issues I only gave 4 starts because of the price.  At fifty dollars for 2.5 oz, it is expensive, but could be worth it if it works well for our skin compared to other products.  While it does have a fragrance, it did not bother me.  I was a little confused on how the product says it protects for 24 hours, but says to reapply every 2 hours.  One other note, this is not a sport sun screen as is it is not water resistant.  If other sun products cause you problems, this might be worth a try, but for my skin type this product is too expensive to continue purchasing.	1
I prefer mineral SPF over chemical ones and this one fits the bill. Sunk in nicely and didn't disturb my makeup. Later I did feel it was piling a bit if I rubbed my forehead, but I think that's fairly common with mineral SPFs. I started using this more once it got really hot. I wore this to an amusement park and it was a mess. Not water or sweat resistant, and if it gets in your eyes it burns. When you get sweaty it beads up and smears. This is not meant to be worn with any activity. I can wear this for lazy indoor or minimal activity days but never again will I use it if I intend to get hot or sweat at all. Not worth the cost at all.	-1
While this doesn't go on easy for me, it takes a while to make sure the white layer is completely rubbed in, it does have a nice texture to it. What I really love is the scent! This is the first sunscreen I've tried that does not smell like sunscreen and in fact has a very pleasant scent to it. I think the price at $49 is too high for what you get though.	1
After having a spot on my arm diagnosed as basal skin cancer, it was suggested I go through annual skin checks by a dermatologist. Besides obviously limiting my overall sun exposure, my dermatologist recommended that when I do go out in the sun to use a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher and one that is broad spectrum (protects against both UVA and UVB rays). This Nia 24 Sun Damage Prevention 100% Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 meets that criteria.  In addition, it contains Pro-Niacin, which according to their labeling, is clinically shown to visibly improve skin tone, texture and hyperpigmentation.  It has a light scent, is color and dye free, and is made in the United States.  All of this is good.  Now for the negatives.  Their labeling also states, This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, NOT skin cancer or early skin aging.  In addition, this product is not water or sweat resistant.  If not rubbed in all the way, your skin appears white.  I was able to receive this product free of charge from the Amazon Vine program.  When it arrived, I was surprised at just how small the container was, especially considering its price.  I personally cannot justify spending that much money on a sunscreen that may or may not help my skin look any younger than considerably less expensive sunscreens.  I will stick with more affordable brands.	-1
More and more I find myself thinking about all the ways that I need to protect my face from the nasty old sun's rays.  This product seems to be quite capable of preventing sun damage.  It truly is important to take steps nowadays to do that.  You can't start too young either. I recommend using this type of product from your teen years forward.  I am 69 years old and when I was a young person we didn't have products like this to help our skin. If I had a teen-aged daughter right now I would but this and have her use it right away.	1
Been using for over 15 years works great	1
Love it!	1
The lime scent of Lacoste LIVE Deordorant Stick is absolutely heavenly. Lacost lists guaiac wood, green leaves, aquatic notes and dark licorice as other ingredients in this very fresh scent.  My husband likes wearing it as much as I enjoy smelling it on him. The stick has a nice, wide head and is easy to put on.  It does its job like a boss.  It's the priciest deodorant I've ever seen, but if the Lacoste scent is what you love, check it out. If you're not that picky, you can surely find a far less expensive deodorant with a pleasant lime scent.  This luxurious Lacost stick is perfect if you want to impress guys at the gym, or as a stocking stuffer for a special guy.	1
I've been using this, and it also works as a unisex scent.  If you like the trademark Lacoste fragrance, it's worth the money.  If not, the price may be a bit steep, as the price point is a bit high.  It worked as well as the average deodorant for me, though I use a heavier clinical formula for intense workouts.	1
This is a bit of a throwback, speed stick deodorant.  I'm a runner, a sweater, and a frequent showerer as a result.  Deodorant isn't that necessary as a result, but I don't like to wear cologne for these same reasons--combined with sweat, it impacts my breathing as I run.  So, the stick is great because it pushes a light scent away from my chest and nose.  Beyond that, and it's fancy name, it's not much different than old school deodorant from high school gym class.  It smells the same.  Not bad, kind of good, but no different than something you bought for $1 in the 8th grade.	1
One doesn't usually wax poetic about deodorant, but this Lacoste L!VE is fantastic.  According to Lacoste, the scent is a combination of: "vibrant lime, uplifting green leaves and intense liquorice".  My son sampled aftershave and cologne scents at Kohls and Lacoste was his favorite.  It's great the company translated their amazing scents into a deodorant like this.  It feels cool with application and lasts.  It doesn't have a deodorant type scent.  It's almost cologne and deodorant in one.  This should be a popular item for men and would make a great stocking stuffer type gift.  It's a gift for the ladies, too, as it makes your guy smell great.	1
I've always been an active, outdoors enthusiast. Among the outside activities I most enjoy are swimming, canoeing, wilderness hiking/camping, and bicycling. I worked outdoors as a swimming life guard.  In short, I didn't know the dangers of being outside in all these sun dominated recreational activities. I have some significant sun damage.  I tried products all along the continuum that claimed to help with this kind of concern. Nothing seemed to work consistently to help regulate my skin/sun damage concerns.  Both my regular MD and a dermatologist recommended this product as part of how I can keep my skin from chronic peeling and reduce sun spot damage.  It's not a cosmetic/vanity thing for me; it's part of a routine I do to keep my skin healthy and to try and prevent further problems. I use the Nia24 Sunblock products, too. I have seen amazing results using this line.	1
I really have been very pleased with the NIA24 Serum, primarily for it's exceptional smoothing and moisturizing skincare benefit. It glides on beautifully - love the soft natural fragrance and I'm pretty sensitive to almost all skincare creams and serums. This NIA24 is really a treat and has significantly smoothed and treated my aging skin. I apply two-three pumps daily to my face, neck and decollage' and really love how it goes on, absorbs and seems to instantly 'feed' my over-exposed skin.  While I haven't noticed significant lighting of my sunspots, I have definitely experienced over evening and lighting of my face and neck. Additionally, I do believe if my application was more consistent, twice daily, rather than just in the morning, it would be more effective at lightening darker spots.  I only gave four stars for the price point, but that may not be completely fair considering that instant lighting results will likely only be achieved with photo-lighting, laser or other professional aesthetic treatments from a licensed medical spa. NIA24, used along with other daily skin care treatments, a regular exfoliate, (I also use a Clarisonic weekly), is an outstanding facial care product for daily skin treatment. Love it! (reviewed by my wife)	1
I wish Amazon Vine gave more time to evaluate certain products before writing a review, but they don't, so here goes. So far, I've been using this serum for about two weeks. It squirts out easily, though I always have a little too much product that comes out with each pump. It goes on smoothly and doesn't create any excess oil or dry out my face. I haven't seen a remarkable difference in spots, but I'm hopeful that will come with time.	1
I just finished using my first bottle of dr brandt's LaserFX Perfect Serum, and I have to admit, this serum is really great stuff. Over the weeks that I used Laser FX, initially my skin began to feel smoother and look brighter/healthier, then I found the little lines around my eyes diminishing, and finally my "squint" line started to go away. I also noticed overall a more even complexion. My skin feels younger - very smooth, soft, and supple - like it did 10 years ago. I'm not quite sure how to describe it ... for me, my skin was firmer and yet at the same time it feels smoother. The feeling of my skin as well as the look is definitely improved after using this product for almost 4 weeks.  Knowing that only 20% of the aging process in my skin is biological, it made sense to me that you can influence the aging process with how I treat and protect my skin. With 80% of the aging process coming from the environment, using products to protect and care for my skin has become a priority for me as I age. Ive also talked to our daughters about how they care for their skin, and even though they're both young, they are subject to everyday stresses and aren't always in the most beneficial environment for their skin - sun, swimming, or around smoke. I know the natural biological defenses in our skin breaks down with aging, and thats where the biologically engineered skin care products come into play - they enhance and support the biological defenses..  There are a lot of ingredients in Laser FX, but the primary 3 are: 1. Heptapeptides  - peptide are forms of proteins and have many benefits. There are many different types of peptides and all have various functions. Peptides deliver the proteins to the undermost layer of the skins ability to increase the collagen. 2. Biomimetic Peptides - One of the reason aging skin becomes less firm and loses elasticity and the ability to bounce back is because the dermis and epidermis lose the ability to function well together. Biomimetic Peptides help the skin by replicating the function of more youthful skin, enabling it to regain some of its ability to produce collagen and stave off the visible signs of aging - wrinkles, skin tone, and sagging.  3. This ingredient was of particular interest to me. Im really into Ayurvedic herbs, and Centella Asiatica, better known as Gotu Kola, and also Indian Pennywort, has been used in the Orient, as well as in India for thousands of years, and is listed in Indias ancient medical text.  Centella Asiatica has skin enhancing properties when used topically in the form of ointments - including helping with eczema, leprosy, lupus, varicose ulcers, eczema, and psoriasis. It has good skin healing properties, and decreases the inflammatory response when used topically, as well as taken internally, and comes in tablet, capsule, tincture, extract, and tea form. It  is used to fight the oxidative stress caused by free radicals. Oxidative stress contributes to aging in general and various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders. There has been a great deal of interest in this herb in recent years, and many studies done on its beneficial uses - particularly in the West as a neuroprotectant.  The effect of Centella Asiatica for cosmetic is the calming anti inflammatory effect of this herb - it has been considered the best home remedy for skin disorders such as chronic ulcers and persistent eczema. Centella Asiatica has incredible tonifying properties for the entire body. Its just one more medicinal herb thats been used in Asian and Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years, and fortunately allopathic medicine is coming around, and finally doing research to prove the benefits of these herbs and herbal formuls. Gotu Kola was one I hadnt read up on too much, and thankfully it came up as the third primary ingredient in dr brandt Laser FX Perfect Serum.  Application of the product is specific - as I found out with another product, not dr brandt, but  they recommend applying it in a particular manner - it was an expensive neck cream. I didn't find out how I was supposed to apply it until I was more than  done with the cream. I checked the website for dr brandt and it also recommends applying it in a particular manner - which I did. I don't know if that helped or not, but I did get a good effect.  There are three serums in the Dr. Brandt Laser FX Series: Lift, Perfect, and Bright. Each serum is designed to target a different skin care concern. I only tried the Perfect, but at some point Id like to try them together because I have a feeling they're synergistic - working together for the best effect on the skin. At $78 it is pricey, but I don't think you'll get the same effects from a drug store brand.  I would definitely recommend dr brandt Laser FX Perfect Serum for those concerned with skin beginning to show the signs of aging.	1
This lotion is lightweight. Really lightweight. If you need a lot of moisturizing then this probably won't be enough. It goes on smoothly. It has a mild scent. It has a bit of a weird lemony scent to it which I don't care for, but fortunately its mild. This lotion does not make my skin feel greasy. As far as the laser part goes, I don't really feel this product lives up to its claims. It says diminishes lines & wrinkles, retexturizes, smooths. And results are supposed to be fairly quick. It gives you a week by week breakdown of what it does.  It softens and smooths skin instantly. Skin looks plumper by one week. Appearance of lines and wrinkles diminishes by 2 weeks. Skin texture significantly improves by 3 weeks. Skin looks transformed by 4 weeks. Well, Ive been using this for 4 weeks now and really haven't noticed anything. I like this product as a lightweight moisturizer, but the cost doesnt justify using it for just that.	-1
The serum has a nice, light fresh smell. It soaks in well, without feeling greasy on face or hands.  A person is supposed to experience very noticeable improvements within 4 wk. The sequence of differences to skin as stated, follows. > First week of use - the results should have the skin looking plumper. > Second - lines and wrinkles somewhat diminished. > Third - skin texture significantly improves. > Forth - skin looks transformed.  Our daughter has used this serum before and saw some improvement. Other facial products have made her sensitive skin brake out, this one didn't.  She was pleased with the product in that skin pores are somewhat smaller. She had experienced skin texture feeling nice and a little smoother.  However - her results weren't as dramatic as product statements. There's not noticeable differences in lines and wrinkles.	1
Love the color! It's a great autumn color because it's a great mix of pink and red. Looks even better with a coat of Grapefruit Sparkle on top.	1
This nail polish color is EVERYTHING! I love Shellac and have been using it for the past 5 years. This polish lasts for 2 weeks+ and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. It does require a UV lamp which can be purchased on Amazon as well. This is a professional grade nail polish that can be done at home with ease. I have purchased multiple bottles in different colors and will continue to do so! This is a must buy!!!	1
It's a matt almost red color, I ended up adding my own glitter before the top coat as I like sparkly pearlized shades. It's a pretty color, just no character to it.	1
I was pleasantly surprised by this lengthening mascara. I figured built in fibers were going to equal a fall out disaster, eye irritation, or a clumpy look. Happy to admit that I was wrong on all three counts. The fibers do lengthen, and they stay extremely well, all while giving a very natural lash look. It didn't flake, and was easy to remove. The black is very black, and the formula was smooth. I didn't feel like I had heavy lashes, so for having fibers in it this is a very light formula. Even after two coats, I didn't have a built up, clumpy, spidery, or messy lashes. I'd pick this up again for a natural, yet longer, look.	1
Well what do you know? Actually great mascara. Buildable, "tube like" so doesn't run or smear, just slips off with warm water. No problem with slight fibers that add length. SO APPRECIATE THAT IT IS IN A NICE BROWN!	1
I love this mascara! The curved brush makes it easier to apply than what I was using before. No clumps, streaking or flaking and comes off easy with soap and water.  I definitely have a new mascara!	1
I like the texture of the blush, it goes on my skin smoothly and stays on for hours. The bronzer is quite delicate and it is hard to overdo it. The blush has more pigment, so be more careful with it. There is a little brush included, too, it is quite good for the size. I really like how it looks on me. I was afraid the colors would be too dark on me, but they work really good.	1
These colors are only mildly pigmented, which makes them nice for very fair skin tones. The pink has a bit more saturation than the bronzer color. I get the feeling this set wants to be like the Nars Orgasm/Laguna set, but unfortunately, the texture and finish just aren't as smooth, especially the pink. The pink comes off as a bright pink if you try to build it up (which you have to do in order to get it to show up at all in the first place). So you really have to find the magic amount to use. It is somewhat powdery or lightly chalky - not the texture quality you might be used to if you buy high end brands. It does not feel heavy on the skin though, which is nice. It seems to wear pretty well, despite the texture and consistency. The bronzer needs a lot of building up to be able to see it on the skin and I am fair skinned. I am curious now as to the performance of the other em sets with the peachy or mauve shades instead of the pink. They might be a better option for me.  I do own the Nars Laguna/Orgasm set and prefer that a lot more, for a pink set. If you're looking at this one, I'd recommend the Nars instead due to better performance an higher quality.	1
The blush for 'BLUSH A BYE PINK' is very pink and comes off as a fine powder.  It looked better on my 14 yo daughter than on me, but most things do.  She is very fair and it gave her a natural pinkness.  My complexion is darker and more ruddy.  On me it looked more like a slight flush.  I wasn't sure about the contour color. It looked dark to me, but it was awesome.  It gave me some great faux cheekbones.  BUT THE DESIGN I am NOT a fan of this compact design. I didn't like it on Powder compact and I don't like it here. The compacts come in a really nice box, but the compact itself is boring white. It may have etched words of empowerment on it, but you can't easily see them and so the effect is lost.  The Powder Compact had a sponge applicator and I was okay with that, but this kit has an incredibly small brush. And I'd say that the design is meant to minimize the amount of product that they give us.  I realize that Michelle is a smart business woman, but really, for the price we should be getting a bit more.  SUMMARY This line seems to be designed for teens and young adults. The colors are awesome and varied. They are, however, a little pricey, but if you have a fan, they are going to be delighted to receive this makeup as a gift.  I've already purchased some other colors more suitable for my peaches-and-cream girl.  They'll be great stocking stuffers.  Once a year treats.	1
I do so love this cosmetic line but this particular color blush is a wee bit on the bright side for me even with toning it down with the bronzer.  I will however use it but use it very lightly so I don't look like a painted doll.  When offered this free product to do a review I wish we could have chosen the shade but oh well.  It does go one very smoothly and don't forget to smile while applying.  I think this color would actually look really nice on a darker skinned person.  I am very, very light so I need something more subtle.  This will last some time as you don't need to apply much and the compact is really quite nice and very rugged.  You won't have to worry about this compact breaking in your purse that's for sure.  When choosing a color for yourself always remember that the colors shown are not as bright or dark as they will appear on the screen so be prepared for something more intense when you receive it.  I love the shadows and highly recommend the line.	1
Just tried this for the first time and love it	1
Pleasantly surprised by the look of this polish.  As far as the smell it may not have all of the bad stuff of other nail polishes but it still smells very bad.  Easy to apply.  Crackles almost instantly and dries amazingly fast and the brush is awesome (flat and wide - 2 swipes and you're done).  This polish has a matte finish so I would expect it would need a topcoat to protect it and make it look more finished.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the price seems very high to me but then most of my polish is from the local pharmacy.  I'm including a photo so you can see the crackle pattern after 1 coat.  I applied a second coat and the black pattern was much more pronounced with less of the undercoat showing.	1
While the idea might have seemed good, this nail polish is awful.  The polish that you see in the pictures is not exactly what you will get.  First of all, it looks like it is loaded with sparkles and little black shapes that look kind of like a letter U.  I was eager to see the effect that all of that would have.  Well, the first time that I used it, it looked like clear nail polish with sparse tiny glitter flecks.  I applied two more coats and only got two of the black pieces on my nails.  I have no idea how this is supposed to work, when there isn't much glitter and the black pieces are really hard to get out.  After all of that, the black pieces did not lay flat and easily came off.  They don't always lay flat and the texture is irritating.  I tried several times to use this.  I still had issues with the black ones, even when there is one on the brush, it is hard to get it to lay on the nail right.  This was after I used a third of it.  I am not sure how others got this to work for them, but it was a mess to me.  I am not giving this polish one star because the polish itself is pretty good it dries quickly and lasts.  Basically if you want to try this brand, don't get this color and you will probably be pleased.	-1
I love finger nail polishes. One of the most relaxing things I can do is to paint my nails and maybe have a little bit of pampering time while having gorgeous nails. I love glitter, though I don't wear them very much as it tends to chip off almost immediately. I do like dark colors for nails but I wasn't sure about the black. It does seem to be a bit dark.  I put a coat on my finger nails and I got absolutely nothing. Just a clear coat. So I wiped them off and shook the bottle vigorously. I applied it on my finger nails again. Still nothing. It was a plain coat. I thought, maybe it is meant to be applied on another shade of color then maybe the glitter would show up.  Nada. Still nothing.  I would not buy this. Not at this price. This is disappointing because it just looked good.  Maybe other people will have better luck with this polish than I did. It's not for me.	-1
The USL by Uslu Airlines Nail Polish is a brand that I haven't used before but I was willing to give this brand of try since I love nail polish. This is a nice shade of red but I was expecting a the nice and beautiful taupe or olive color but I guess the shipment was somehow mixed up. The color applies well to the fingernails and lasts a long time without chipping and that's a plus for me because I work on a computer everyday and that means this a high quality nail polish.  I love how smooth this polish applies and I love the glossiness of this nail polish.  I will have to try other colors to see if they are the same but as for now I like this brand.	1
My wife tried this out and was blown away by the quality of a brand that had been completely unknown to her.  We received King's Canyon, which is a vibrant red color that my wife and I both like.  Her thoughts: * It's 5-free - This is always nice to see, but somewhat hard to find * Application is amazingly smooth and uniform, even though the applicator isn't as wide as OPI's. * Additional strokes don't mess up the finish - touch-ups are easy to apply and look great  While we had never heard of Uslu Airlines before, now she can't wait to try more colors from this brand.  We can't think of a single bad thing to say (the price is incredibly fair for the quality you get), so five stars!	1
Many nail polishes contain harmful and or stinky ingredients. The USL product line is free of the five most common offenders: Formaldehyde, Dibutyl Phthalate, Toluene, Formaldehyde Resin, and Camphor.  I thought that I would be getting a brown color nail polish, which is my style, but instead received a very cherry red color. It is beautiful and although not typically my speed I was willing to make an exception.  At first I thought the problem was with the company but after visiting their website it was clear to see that the swatches are mislabeled on the product page. If you plan to order visit their website prior to making your purchase to get the correct color. KBJ is really a beautiful red per the companies website.  The bottle is fairly small, about the size of a tube of lipstick, which makes it easy to slip into a makeup bag. I was a little surprised how small it was given the higher price tag. I typically feel like I'm treating myself when I purchase OPI or Essie nail polish. So, paying more to get about half the amount is a bit of a stretch for me. This bottle contains 1.6 ounces.  As for the polish, it goes on very smooth and has a glossy finish. The upside to paying a little more for it is that it doesn't require a basecoat or topcoat. If you typically do a three part application on your nails you'll probably find this product to be worth the cost. I don't so I find it a little pricey.  I'm going to enjoy it but I'm not certain that I can justify $12 a bottle for this on a regular basis.	1
This is a cheery red nail polish that is a terrific all season choice.(Disregard the murky brown shade depicted in the product description.) It is creamy and applies smoothly. It was free of the clumps found so often in cheaper brands. And speaking of free it is formulated without  formaldehyde,  dibutyl phthalate,  toluene,  formaldehyde resin and  camphor, making it a safer choice for those sensitive to chemicals. Additionally it is not tested on animals, a definite plus in my book. I was impressed with the end result. My nails looked glazed, smooth and shiny.  Drying time was average and the polish seems to hold up well.  Naming polishes after different international airports is a clever idea. This one is named after the Kings Canyon Airport in Australia's Northwest Territory, a bit over 800 miles from Darwin and about 200 miles away from Alice Springs. It is home to a national park known for its sandstone domes. I am not sure what correlation this color has to that location, but it is pretty. If you like polishes that are vibrantly pigmented with a glossy finish, this is definitely one to take on board.	1
I wasn't sure what to expect from a line of polish offered by an airlines, and for the price I didn't want to be disappointed. I am happy to concede that these are worth the price tag. I'm actually excited to be flying in to Germany soon so I can hopefully see more of the USL polishes in person. The color range offered here on Amazon is extensive and offers a great range of colors, I just don't know how reliable the names matched to the color swatches are as I ordered KBJ Kings Canyon, which the swatch makes look like a dark brown, but when I received the correctly labeled polish it's a maraschino cherry red. Other than that, though it's a beautiful red... and the coverage is amazing. I tried this the same way I would if I were traveling, no base and no top, it applied easily, smoothly, and when it says it has built in ridge filler it means it. You couldn't tell that underneath those two smooth layers was some pretty deep grooves from poorly removed gel damage. The brush on this is not as wide as and OPI pro wide, but still wider than an Essie brush. The bristles are soft and spread easily, giving almost my entire nail coverage is a single stroke! The dry time was fast, and even without a top coat it was glossy. I plan on picking up a nice travel neutral, though quite a few colors are calling my name!	1
I love this product.	1
Love!	1
Love it but don't like the smell. Not like the shampoo or conditioner. Smells rancid	1
I started with body butter, and at first I loved how it felt on my skin, how it smelled. My skin felt soft and moisturized. After some time, however, as the butter had time to work deeper into my skin overnight, THE RASH emerged. My arms are currently covered in small red bumps.  I didn't proceed to try any other products.  So, if you have skin sensitive to various chemicals, I would recommend staying away. For everyone else, if you don't mind paying a hefty price for a big tube of body batter and 3 small bottles of face wash, energizing mask and some miracle cream to trim your waistline, sure, it might be more effective.  The box, which could be a gift box, doesnt look very luxurious, for those who are interested in gifting it.	-1
Value gift set for the Bliss Spa lover.  It contains 4 of their best sellers: a full-sized lemon-sage body butter which is a lightly scented rich but not greasy body lotion, a foaming-gel face wash that cleanses and exfoliates without stripping oils from your face, an energizing facial mask plus Bliss Spa's caffeinated body treatment.  Recommended for Bliss Spa lovers and for those building a New York themed gift.	1
This is a nice beauty set.  It comes with four items:  Bliss Lemon and Sage Body Butter - this is my favorite item in the set.  The body butter smells lovely and it leaves my skin feeling so soft and moisturized, without leaving a greasy sensation.  I have been using this on my dry hands and arms as well as my feet, and it is the best body butter I have ever tried.  I am very impressed.  Bliss Fabulous Foaming Face Wash - this is another nice item.  The face wash left my skin feeling very clean, soft, and smooth.  It exfoliated but did not over-dry.  It had a pleasant scent.  Bliss Triple Oxygen Instant Energizing Mask - this is a nice mask.  You leave it on for five minutes and it left my skin feeling refreshed, clean, and tight.  Bliss Lovehandler - this is the only item I didn't like.  It didn't do anything, except maybe slightly moisturizing my stomach.  I didn't see any improved appearance or fat reduction, nor do I think a product like this can legitimately reduce fat.  Overall, I love three of the four items in this set.  The samples are large enough that you can get a lot of use out of them.  The box is attractively packaged.  I think this would make a great holiday gift for a loved one or even for yourself.	1
This wound up being exactly what I needed during my trip to Denver. My skin got so dry and this came to my rescue. I liked that there was no scent, so it didn't interfere with my allergies. It went on smooth and sank into my skin so easily. It did not leave my skin greasy, either. Just soft and smooth, getting rid of all the high-altitude dry nasties. I only got a tiny sample, which lasted me about a week but over that week, my skin was soft and smooth, just like we want it to be. Also, on the plus side, I got carded! Don't know if that was because of this lotion but it didn't hurt.	1
Natura Bisse Essential Shock Intense Cream, 2.5 fl. oz. does great things for the fine lines on your face, but does nothing for the actual deeper wrinkles. You will notice the dry parts of your face will soak this Intense Cream up. The cream itself does hydrate your skin, and you will notice a smoothness after using it for a week or two.  The scent of this cream is odd- its like a baby powder crossed with a plastic smell. Making your skin feel smoother and softer is nice, but I prefer a cream that can soften deeper lines, and this one only softens very fine lines. I didn't see anything firmer, as its advertised to do, but it will make your skin softer and smoother.  4 STARS.	1
Pros:  - silky smooth formula that leaves my face soft  - a little bit goes a long way  - no greasy residue left behind  - my face stays hydrated all day with one application  Cons:  - price is way too high  - scent is baby powder like and a bit strong	1
Excellent	1
I got this to try on my crow's feet around my eyes.  After trying it for a while on one side to compare with the non-treated side, I can say that there was a noticeable result.  It did not really eliminate or even reduce the lines, but it did produce an overall softening of the entire area.  The hydrating effect seemed to be noticeable too, as there was an overall increase in the suppleness of the skin.  It's hard to describe, but I would say the treated area had a healthier, softer appearance that reduced some of the harshness of the crow's feet.  I would love it if I could say this worked miracles and took the wrinkles away, but I accept reality - this does help to promote healthier looking skin, so mission accomplished.	1
I've been using this about 2 weeks, so not really long enough to notice any anti-aging effects.  I'll update later on that.  So far, though, I haven't found it to be irritating (I use it every other night), and it feels good on (not too greasy) and seems to absorb nicely.	1
The coverage that Dermablend is famous for does not disappoint in this product. I prefer a medium coverage, but find that most medium or light coverage foundations take more than one application to get the desired coverage I want. Then full coverage is often more like paint than foundation. This lets me control that coverage a bit more when I blend it with an illuminating serum. This helps me thin it out, but still give me a solid full coverage that I'm looking for. I use a  brush to apply and a blender sponge to even things out and blend the last bits. Then after this, just a blender for any concealer and a standard fluffy brush for blush after this. I use a bit of setting powder, and I'm done till usually mid-afternoon when I touch a few spots up with my blender and take an oil sheet to my face. This can be a bit cakey if you don't put it on and blend it in thin, but it's not too bad if you work with it a bit.	1

[+/- May Contain: Ci 77891 / Titanium Dioxide, Ci 77499, Ci 77492, Ci 77491 / Iron Oxides, Ci 77120 / Barium Sulfate]. I had a similar-looking expensive department store product as a concealer and wasn't at all happy with it, it  did not provide complete coverage. So either I had unluckily bought a particular tube that was a lemon, or the entire product line was faulty.  After that, it took me a while to get around to trying this, principally because I recently had some facial work done and  no concealer was going to hide that resulting swelling, discoloration. But the work is healing a bit now, looking better, and this concealer worked just fine on any remaining problems.  No irritation. One tip: use sparingly: a little goes a long way. .	1
This is AMAZING for under eyes! First, dot on very lightly. Then use a Beauty Blender (or make-up sponge) to gently blend this in. Use less than you typically would with other products (this thoroughly covers). If you need just a touch more, add a bare minimum, and then blend again. Use the Dermablend foundation over this (for uniform color). Again, apply less then you typically would. Blend, blend, blend.  The results are just gorgeous. And the look will appear natural and polished as long you you use a minimum and then blend as needed.  Dermablend is easily one of the very best products on the market. I have used their line for years and years! LOVE IT! So highly recommended!	1
The Dermablend concealer is easy to apply and goes n smoothly. This particle color was a little lighter than expected but it did do the job of concealing the circles under my eyes and the occasional adult acne. With the very hot and humid weather in southern Florida, the concealer surprisingly enough did not needed to be reapplied which I found to be a big plus. I gave it one less star due to the color being lighter than expected.	1
I've been using this a couple of weeks now. I don't have age spots, but my skin tone tends to be uneven and this has helped with that. I imagine it's especially good in winter as it has been keeping my skin from drying out. I do wake up looking more fresh and glowy.	1
This works fine as a night cream and leaves my skin moister and supple, but it's not transformative.  I have not noticed any visible difference or added brightness in my skin tone.  My skin feels much better if it is moisturized, and this does the trick, but I would expect it does not outperform significantly less expensive products. It does have a lovely, yummy scent and feels luxurious going on.	1
I've been using the night cream (a bit of a misnomer as it is more of a serum) nightly for just over a week. While the dark circles under my eyes haven't disappeared I do see a slight lightening of the circles. Others mentioned a glow after using the Vichy Night Cream. I have had the same experience. I will review the cream again after 4 weeks of nightly use. The instructions say that results will be noted in 4 weeks. I will also post before and after pictures. This product is pricey, but I haven't really experienced another product like it and if it really does lighten the circles it might be worth it.	1
I have a small spot on my face that I thought was an age spot but may just be a discoloration from working outside in the sun too much. I have used this nightly for weeks now and I do see it growing lighter and may gradually disappear. I think it is changing all my skin though because it looks better and I didn't even know anything was wrong with the rest of my face, but my skin does look better. There is a faint smell to this that is not bad but for some reason I don't like it. It's not a cream but more like a gel and a little bit goes a long way. My skin is slightly oily and it's working for me. I'm not sure how well it would work on someone who has dry skin.	1
If I had to choose just one piece of makeup to have, it would be a concealer. This does double duty to hide any breakouts and also using a little under the eyes to look more fresh and rested. The applicator is super easy to use and a little goes a long way, so I expect this little bottle will last for quite a while. My only complaint is that it's just a bit darker than I expected. I'd go a shade lighter next time. But overall fantastic product.	1
I think a great concealer - it goes on really smoothly and evenly and is easy to apply exactly where you need it because of the brush applicator and it does a great job of covering up problem areas. Probably my new favorite concealer.	1
Works so well.  Stays all day.  Doesn't sweat off.  Have to use soap to remove and then it comes right off.	1
Great coverage, great smooth texture and non-irritating.	1
I'm really happy with this concealer. It goes on smoothly and I blend it just a bit with my clean finger pad. It covers dark circles under my eyes and sun spots I have on my cheeks. It's a great shade to match my skin tone. I put it on just once and it looks good all day. It does not clump or get cakey at all. When I wash my face though, it comes off completely to leave my skin clean. It's fairly thick out of the container and a little goes a long way. I'm very pleased to have this product to help hide any imperfections.	1
Perfect for covering dark circles under my eyes, birthmarks, age spots, dry red patches, and whatever else unwanted may be lurking on my face. it's super simple to apply in the exact spot where I need it. I like the slim tube to carry with me in case I find something else that needs covering or need a touch up.  It's so easy to blend. I've found a good foundation that is very close to this color of this coverage so they mesh together well.	1
I really REALLY like this brand but finding just the right shade can be a bit tricky especially in summer with a tan. I thought this would do the trick but it's just a hint darker than hoped - still the same great coverage, easy to apply and non irritating format. I would absolutely buy this again in the future just going with a slightly lighter shade.	1
I adore the applicator. I love the shape, weight and size of the container, This product has me hook, line and sinker. Brilliant. And to seal the deal the makeup itself absorbs quickly and smoothly leaving skin looking flawless. I can't see how this combination can be beat.	1
I use this cover up for small imperfections on my face, it holds up all day and looks natural. Be sure to get the right color match.	1
This concealer works really well to even out the redness in my cheeks. I apply it in dabs, then I take a highlighter brush and smooth it out. After allowing it to dry, I apply my foundation. My foundation applies easily over the top. I am unable to see any redness through my foundation. Dermablend is a high quality brand. I have used several of their products and have always been satisfied!	1
This concealer is great, it really does cover those dark spots or blemishes.  I have not found another concealer that lasts as long as this one and actually keeps what I want covered.	1
This is a nice concealer although a little lighter than I expected. It is a little dry and works better on oily skin. A little goes a long way.	1
I really like this concealer.  It has excellent coverage without being very thick and heavy.  I actually blend this with my fingers while it is still moist.  I use the Dermablend foundation now and I love them both!  I don't have problems with this fading or sweating.  It stays put all day.  I would recommend that you use a makeup remover when washing your face at night.	1
Although you might have to apply multiple layers, it does not have the cake-like or sticky feeling.  It blends well with your skin.  Color as was expected.  It feels as if it moisturizes your skin enough that it does not feel dry after application.  It also blends well with your other makeup/foundation.  Nice product that will hide many imperfections and even some tattoos.  5 stars.	1
This is an incredible concealer. It a great size and comes in a tube more the size of mascara that can be dropped into your purse for easy touch-ups and travel. It comes with a sponge tip that easily applies the make-up to your skin and can be smoothed out with your fingers. The coverage is medium to dark, but blends nicely to my skin tone. What is not to like about this product. The make-up is super creamy, goes one easily and only takes a very small amount for complete coverage. It has a matt finish that looks and feels great on my skin. I only wish that I had gotten this concealer sooner.  It has no odor and does not irritate my sensitive skin.  I love it.	1
I really like the Dermablend brand. This is my fourth product that I have ordered and I have been pleased with each one. The concealer covers skin blemishes and smooths uneven skin tones. It is also good for under the eye circles.	1
I'm a redhead with very sensitive skin and this caused no irritations whatsoever. I mainly apply this under my eyes along with other foundation, it seems to camouflage well and works nicely with many different types of brand foundations as well. I use this three times a week, it is definitely my go to concealer since it has such a slim and compact design,it's very easy to slip in purses (or even back pockets)	1
The very best of the light-touch liquid concealer wands, and I've probably tried 'em all. This one is smoothest and most opaque, and it's perfect for seamlessly dotting on over foundation when you notice something showing through. You can use it under foundation too if you give it a minute to dry, but if you have heavy duty concealing needs, start with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dermablend-Cover-Creme-Full-Coverage-Foundation-Makeup/dp/B0017MWW56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dermablend Cover Creme Full Coverage Foundation Makeup</a>&nbsp;and carry this little miracle worker with you for touch-ups if necessary.  One thing to know about Dermablend is that you can't always go by how a color appears on your screen, so you're best off ordering a sample kit (available free at the Dermablend website) before you invest in the actual makeup. But once you've got the right color match, you'll never look back at all that drugstore concealer.	1
I have bought Dermablend products in the past and am never disappointed by them.  This Dermablend concealer covers any bruises, marks or whatever you want to cover up quickly and easily. I suggest using a matching face powder over this to set the product.	1
I never thought I'd be a serum user, but I've completely fallen in love with this product. I first used it morning and night as directed, but have stopped on the days when I have work in the morning, because I use moisturizer, primer and then makeup. If you use primer, you absolutely cannot use anywhere near the time of the Booster Oil application, as it will cake and then make foundation clump up.  So using it at night, I've had wonderful results. I have EXTREMELY dry skin, and tend to cake on moisturizer. Two drops of this, I don't need moisturizer on my face in the morning, it's amazing. It immediately gives my complexion a matte but glowy look, and I've gotten compliments after I put it on. My skin has stopped flaking, my dark circles are a little less mean looking, and I feel better about the area where I know I'm going to get wrinkles.	1
If the only thing this product accomplished was aromatherapy, I would consider buying it despite the price. No, I wouldn't really, but I do love how it smells.  I can't quite define it, but citrusy, like a cross between lemon and grapefruit. I'm an "unscented" type of person, so saying that I like the smell of something is saying a lot, and this is lovely, light, and refreshing.  Despite my advanced age, my face still breaks out, but, so far, this oil hasn't caused a breakout or an allergic reaction. It's a very light oil and absorbs into the skin quickly, although I do have to be careful not to use too much. To that end, I don't even use the pump, I just take the dropper out and touch it to my fingertip.  Since I've been using it, my face does feel softer and isn't dry at all despite it being winter, and the furnace is running. I sure wish I'd had this last winter when the furnace ran nearly non-stop!  But forget all of that. The real benefit has been to my fingernails, cuticles and the backs of my hands. When I finish with my face and neck, I rub whatever's left on my fingers into my hands. WOW! Despite not having had a manicure in months, my cuticles look great, my nails are long and strong, and the backs of my hands are soft and look smooth. Now, when I'm done with my face, I add a dab more to my hands and massage it in well. I especially like using it at night because how wonderful to fall asleep to that lovely scent!  Yes, this is pricey, but I recommend it, and will be buying more for myself, and as gifts for others.  12/27/2014 One month later and my face looks great! Forehead lines have disappeared, and my neck lines have improved a lot!	1
I don't usually use oils on my face but this one has been a great addition to my beauty routine especially during winter when my skin dries out. This is "rich in essential fatty acids, antioxidants and vitamins" per the manufacturer and this has the potent NIA-114 that StriVectin products are known for to help skin cells renew and replace themselves. My skin was firmer and I used this in the mornings as the first product out of the shower and the lemony scent was pleasant. I then applied my makeup and it stayed put and my skin was nourished and it alleviated fine lines for hours as a skin filler that moisturized my face. At night I would use it before bed and then add another skin cream from the StriVectin line of products. I like this bottle as it is small enough to drop in my makeup bag and it assists in giving my skin a youthful glow.	1
I'm a committed Arbonne user and mix the StriVectinLABS High Performance Booster Oil with my serum to apply. The oil has a lemon scent that I beleive may be added to cover up a more chemically smell which it mostly does.  For oil, it certainly doesn't make my face greasy in the slightest. It is hard to explain but it does have a mild firming effect.  The closet example I can think of is the way a thin, gel facial mask feels but way less restrictive. The "mask" feeling lasts, pretty much all day.  As for my fine lines and wrinkles...no impact there but very well might be if I wore foundation and powder which I don't.	1
I like that this oil will completely absorb into the skin after several minutes and not leave an oily layer. I still don't use it under makeup though; I apply it at night to my face, neck and cuticles before my usual CeraVe moisturizer. A few drops go a long way. It has a very light citrus scent that is pleasant but doesn't overpower. I have been using it for about two weeks and so far I don't think this product has been transformative though it does temporarily reduce the appearance of very fine lines. But it is a very good moisturizing oil and if the price point isn't a problem I think you would be happy with it. I made the mistake of handling the bottle with oily fingers; it slipped into the sink and I lost half of it down the drain. Still not over it.  Below is a list of the ingredients. Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil  Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil  Crambe Abyssinica Seed Oil  Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Oil  Myristyl Nicotinate Retinyl Palmitate Tocopherol  Bisabolol Humulus Lupulus (Hops) Strobile  Vaccinium Vitis-Idaea Seed Oil, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Seed Oil Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate  Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride Oxycoccus Palustris Seed Oil  Hippophae Rhamnoides Seed Oil Parfum (Fragrance) Hydroxymethoxyphenyl Propylmethylmethoxybenzofuran	1
My husband is a big fan of the bottle, and we both love the scent. Rather fresh in nature, and definitely fits the Jimmy Choo style. It works great as an everyday scent.	1
Jimmy CHOO Man Eau de Toilette has a clean, unique fragrance that isn't overwhelming. It lasts about 6 hours on my hubby. Of course, fragrance reacts with your body chemistry & could smell differently on you.  We both like it & it doesn't give me a headache like some he's used in the past.	1
This is reallllllllly good makeup setting spray! It possibly better than the Urban decay brand. Definitely buy this. This spray is even and smells great. Lasts up to 8 hours depending on your foundation. Ive had it last 12+ hours	1
I've used Nia products for years, however I recently noticed I needed even more of a boost to maintain a smooth complexion. One or two drops of this Catalyst mixed with a small pea size amount of Nia moisturizer and used in the morning saved my skin from peeling during the day. The effect is worth the product value. I recommend this for anyone who struggles with a face that due to early life sun damage has troubled flaking dry skin!	1
Excellent	1
The challenge with most skin care and especially skin repair products is that it is very difficult to judge their effectiveness in the short term.  And by the time you can judge their effect youve potentially spent a fortune.  In most cases Ive found that with careful consideration of the ingredients that there is some benefit to using a product.  Whether its a simple moisturizer or SPF for protection you are generally getting some benefit for your hard earned dollars.  In the case of this Nia24 I have to say that I have really enjoyed using it.  Ive never used a product quite like this on my face before.  The closest comparison is to the Solar Oil my wife uses on her nails. It is very thick clear oil made up of various seeds and vitamins that claim to repair sun damage and enhance your normal face products.  I started off by just using the oil by itself twice a day.  Three drops to my forehead and rubbing it over the rest of my face.  I love the texture and dull sheen it leaves on my face.  My face at least looks healthier immediately and feels very nice as well.  It also has a very mild but pleasant odor, partially because of the perfume in the ingredients list. Recently, I started putting on my moisturizer and SPF over the Nia24 with mixed results. It seemed to lessen the points I liked about the oil and the way it made my skin feel, not to mention that SPF never smells very good.  Nia24 contains Bisabolo which is supposed to aid in the absorption of product into your skin; hopefully making your other products more effective. It contains other agents to help plump and regrow your skin cells which reduces perception of lines and wrinkles.  I honestly haven't noticed that happening in the last 30 days I have used the product but I wouldnt let that put you off of this product.  One point of note is that this contains Retinyl palmitate which is a type of Retinol and noted as a pregnancy risk, but not when used in topical form.  But, if you are pregnant may want to check with your MD before considering this.  Once Ive used it a bit longer Ill be better able to evaluate the other benefits.  Now that we are headed into summer I hope I will benefit from the restorative benefits.  I have really enjoyed using this product and was pleasantly surprised by how good it makes my skin feel right from the start.	1
The problem with skin care products is that the test is not very scientific. I cannot compare what would have happened if I hadn't been using the product. Having said this and admitting that my review is based on observation and remembered comparisons, I think that the Nia 24 treatment does make a difference.  I've been using it for a little over three weeks and I haven't been consistent in the method of use because the instructions are a bit vague. It says to use a couple of drops and you can use them either after applying your usual face lotion to your skin or mixing it with your lotion before applying.  With the first method, two drops don't cover my whole face and neck. For the second method I didn't know what the ratio of cream to treatment was supposed to be. No amount is specified, so it was trial and error for me. What I've finally settled on (and it appears to be working) is to take a tiny bowl (one of those tiny things you use in the kitchen to pre-measure spices for a recipe); squeeze a bit more than a teaspoon of my usual  face cream into it, add 3 drops of the Nia 24, and stir it together. This is enough for face, neck, and the top of my hands. If I have any left over in the little bowl, I simply cover it and apply it to my hands later. (I arrived at 3 drops after noticing what 2 drops covered in the first method).  My observations are that my face and neck do appear to feel softer and more hydrated (should I say "nourished?) after two weeks of using it this way and the cream absorbs just as well. I can't really say how much of this improvement is due to the treatment and how much is due to the fact that, since I take my job as reviewer seriously, I was being a lot more diligent in applying my moisturizer.  I can speak with more confidence about my hands, though. I know that this isn't the intended use of the treatment, but I was getting very self-conscious about how old and dry my hands were looking. I looked at my hands more times everyday than I looked at my face, so I am more certain that I can testify that a noticeable improvement has occurred. They no longer have that old crone look.  I'm not saying they look young but they do look respectable and, now, when I look at them, I no longer cringe.	1
Pretty standard eyelash curler, it's well designed, compact, feels like it is made quality (action is smooth, finish seems nice).  The part your eyelashes crimp to have these blue chamomile pads that are supposed to soften and help out your eyelashes.  The pad itself feels quite nice and seems to work well, but not sure if it's any better than the standard rubber pads.  It does come with 2-3 extra pads as well (and if you need more than that, well I think you need to buy another curler as they do not appear to be sold elsewhere).	1
This eyelash curler does a good job at producing pretty, natural-looking curves with as little discomfort as could be possible.  It is a traditional curler made of sanitary metal with a wide head and gentle arch.  The soft silicone pad is easy on the lashes and two spares are included.  The pads are infused with chamomile, but I don't feel or see any advantage to that.	1
I definitely can see some difference.  I would definitely recommend this product to any one, if you start earlier that age 72.	1
I just got this today, applied a little tiny bit off the cover of the cream, and this stuff stinks to high heaven!  It is a horrible smell.  I don't recall anyone's reviews stating this, but it is awful.  If I slept alone, maybe would try at night?  But I don't.  Too bad.  I saw this on a talk show and it sounded like it would really work, even though I know most creams don't do anything.  Plus it was super expensive, so it is going back.	-1
First off, I want to say only I'm only doing 4 stars because if any of these restorative products work, they are going to take more than a month or two; it took me 30+ years to get in this condition so I can't very well expect a cream to knock out decades of damage in a few uses. Since I am in my 30s, I consider these to be more preventative.  With that said, I do notice a difference within about 5 minutes of putting this on. I get sleep lines on my dcolletage area that like to hang about for a few hours. I apply this and shortly thereafter, the lines have faded significantly. I know that I'm not just imagining the change because the areas where this is NOT applied suddenly look 10 years older. The wrinkles/creases are still there but dramatically improved. As yet, I have not noticed a huge difference in how they look upon waking, so I'm not sure about the long term effects.  I have really sensitive skin so I did go really, really slow at introducing this product. I used just a smidge on two fingers once a day for a bit, and then slowly increased. I have a bit of redness after putting it on, but I don't know if that's from the rubbing, the product, or both. I haven't had any discomfort beyond a slight warmth.  As for the product itself, upon opening, you are greeted with a semi-solid product in the container. Despite being mostly solid, the stuff is smooth and creamy to the touch and applies beautifully. In fact, I think that the fact it isn't all gloopy aids in having precise control over how much product is used. One thing that I do really, really hate is the fragrance. It's not strong or terribly unpleasant, but I'm sensitive to smells, specifically artificial frangrance (hooray migraines!) so there are days I just can't use this at all.  If it weren't for the fragrance, I would be all up for buying other products in this line, especially those designed for the dcolletage. I may still consider them in the future, despite the smell, if I notice an overall marked difference toward the end of this product.	1
NIA 24 NECK SCULPTING COMPLEX is a cream designed to firm and lift the skin along the neckline.  My wife used this for 1 month and noticed both immediate and longer-term positive results.  POSITIVES:  - The cream is thick  a little goes a long way. - A big plus was that the complex was not greasy and did not cause any outbreaks. - Upon application, there was noticeable softening of the skin and over time (2-3 weeks), the firming qualities of the cream became evident. - My wife experience no side effects/rashes at all using the NIA 24.  WORD OF CAUTION:  - The active ingredient is Niacin which is a stimulant that is known to generate a wide range of reactions that range from slight (a warm, flushed and or tingling sensation to the face/neck) to more severe (headaches and stomach pain).  My wife takes niacin daily as a supplement and experiences no side-effects and this cream was fine for her.  It may be wise to buy a bottle of niacin tablets at a grocery store (its cheap) and test it before wasting a considerable amount of money on a product that makes you miserable to use.  My wife loves the NIA 24 NECK SCULPTING COMPLEX because it actually delivers on its promise to soften and firm her neck.  The only downside is that the product is somewhat pricey (but 1.7 oz. will last a while).	1
This cream doesn't have a smell, which I prefer over some overly perfumed creams.  Unlike many of the other reviewers, I felt no tingling or sensation from this cream, whatsoever. It goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely into the skin. As of yet, I can't tell if it's having significant results, but my skin does feel more moisturized and less dry, so will update in a few weeks, and adjust the star rating accordingly. On a side note, a friend came over and saw the box and couldn't believe I had the same cream she'd just been trying and she was raving about it (I'd just got it at that point).  One thing I don't like is that the cream is so thick, it really should have an applicator to get the product out of the jar to be applied. If I use my fingers, I have to get cream up my fingernails (which are not even long) and I hate that.	1
I have used concealers for years as I have always had dark circles under my eyes and red discoloration on one side of my nose due to broken capillaries.  I have always used my finger to put concealer on and its been less than optimum for me as it results in uneven coverage.  The Scott-Vincent Borba concealer brush allows me to apply my concealer with a level of detail and consistency I have never been able to achieve before.  To be honest, I had never even considered the possibility of bacterial contamination from putting my hands in my concealer product, but that makes sense, too.  The tool fits well in my hand and is soft on my face, so there is no pulling on the tender skin under my eyes.  I can get the product into the area between my eyes and nose where previously I had problems with too much or too little product and having to dab at it with tissues to try to get it right.  The only thing that is a consideration with this tool is the cost.  For me, as I use concealer all the time, I would spend the money to get a great tool.  If you don't use it all the time, it may seem to be too much to spend.  That is a personal decision.  I can say that it is an excellent product and one that I am happy to use.	1
The Scott-Vincent Borba Concealer Tool is an excellent make-up accessory and does exactly as advertised.  The tool combines an angled end to apply concealer and a foam teardrop sponge to blend it in. The tool is very well constructed and performs as well as any high-end tool but at 2x-3x the cost. It appears that you are paying for the designer and the design concept.  If price is not a constraint, this is a great combination tool.	1
This is a basic under-eye concealer brush and given the long name attached to this to justify the ridiculous price, you would think this was invented by NASA itself! First of all, the moment you hold this under 5 inches of concealer brush in your hands, you will think in no way is the $40 price tag justified. The sponge tip is nothing like the beauty blender incase people are wondering. You can wet it but there isn't any purpose to it since it doesn't expand. The tip is soft but also quite floppy which for some may mimic the way you pad on the product with your index finger in the under-eye area. That said, I'm concerned that given how floppy it is, it may not last long. I maybe in the minority but had to post an honest review since $40 is lot of money to shell for a tiny slip of a brush. There are much better concealer brushes out there for half the price.	-1
You know, I thought this might be another one of those products that is alright, but not worth the money. Brushes and other makeup applicators can be expensive, and this is pretty pricy as well - but it's worth it! I am a huge fan of the Beauty Blender sponge, and often use it to put on my foundation. Even the fine tip of the (regular-sized) beauty blender is too large for the under eye area. They do make a more petite-sized beauty blender, but that can be a bit unwieldy because it's so small. This solves the problem - a beauty-blender-ish sponge at the end of a long handle. It's easy to use, and it honestly is the best way to put on concealer that I've found. And I've tried a lot of things because I have *very* dark circles under my eyes.  The sponge tip is very sturdy and I anticipate this lasting a long time. My favorite way to clean this (and my beauty blender) is a bar of Dr. Bronner's soap. Much cheaper than proprietary cleaners and it does a better job.  I was fortunate enough to get this through Amazon Vine, but I try hard to write my review as if I had paid the full purchase price, for I feel it is only fair for those who read and rely on reviews. I think this is worth the money and if I lost it, I would definitely buy one.	1
I'm 40 years old with very sensitive skin that is oily in hot months and dry/ flaky in cold months. This moisturizer was perfect for my skin during winter because it's rich and creamy without feeling heavy. My skin felt moisturized and healthy without out any allergic reactions or breakouts. I must admit that I had hoped this product would soften the lines on my forehead but it didn't. However, I would still recommend this product to people with dry skin because it truly helped my skin to look supple and feel wonderful during winter when my skin would normally be dry and flaky.	1
Very moisturizing. Not thick or heavy at all. I have very sensitive skin and this did not cause any redness or irritation.	1
Eau De Parfums can be overpowering if used too generously; this scent is no exception.  When used conservatively, it is such a subtle yet crisp and delicate but sweet scent.  I think the true test to finding a scent that complements your body chemistry is to have people ask what fragrance you are wearing.  This happens a lot when I wear this scent.  I really like this scent and it delicately clings to clothing - even days later.	1
My BURBERRY is an elegant perfume that is runway-inspired and features notes of sweet pea, bergamot, golden quince, freesia, patchouli, rain-tipped damask, and centifolia roses.  Normally, I find perfumes that have strong fragrances like bergamot, patchouli, and geranium to smell aged and not altogether youthful. However, what makes this perfume unique is that it smells like spring. It is bouncy, fun, yet remains sophisticated. I like the fragrance does not overpower me. The perfume is said to represent a London garden after a rain and I think it does that completely.   My Burberry smells like wet flowers in the sun and it is a treat. It smells youthful and light and I think this perfume is perfect for women of any age and would make an excellent gift.  The perfume lasts for several hours with a light mist and lingers lightly on the clothing and skin once the scent has dissipated. This is a carefree and happy smelling perfume and an excellent choice.	1
My Burberry is a permanent fixture on my vanity. I love this sweet pea and bergamot scent. A few spritzes go along way and it lasts all day with my body chemistry.  Here are my other favorites-  Si -Georgio Armani Gabrielle -Chanel Chloe -Original & Roses scent Love Relentlessly -Tory Burch J'adore -Dior My Burberry Black -Burberry La Vie est Belle -Estee Lauder	1
My wife loves this scent and thinks the bottles is just gorgeous with its tortoise cap and bow. The 3 oz bottle will last her a long time, she estimates about a year and thats still spritzing everyday. The scent is sweet and crisp and it actually can still be inhaled hours later. Being a very picky headache sufferer from perfume overload to date, this is the first perfume she has had that she loves to squirt on more than once a day! Overall, this Eau De Parfum Spray is worth the money, so treat yourself.	1
It's hard to buy a perfume without testing it first, so try to test before purchase.  This Burberry fragrance is pleasantly feminine.  It is not sporty, not bright and light, and I don't think it would be a teenager's choice.  Maybe it's a bit too heavy?  It sure does last!  I found I like the fragrance better as it aged.  For instance, I sprayed it on my wrist, then put on a cardigan sweater.  Days later I could still catch a whiff of it on my sweater sleeve.  This eau de parfum is potent, and you will want to use it sparingly.  Which leads me to the observation that the spray bursts out of the nozzle in a wide and strong pattern.  I'm used to more delicate, shorter sprays.  The bottle is hefty and very impressive.  Comes in a pretty box for gifting.	1
Jeff's Wife: Burberry Women is the most subtle yet pleasant scent I've ever worn. I have had people walk past me and turn around and ask me what fragrance I'm wearing. Smells very soft and powdery! I love it. As a bonus, my hubby likes it too!	1
I'd never have guessed that a rose scent mixed with a tad of geranium leaf would smell so delightful, but this is wonderful perfume that I will most likely enjoy for years, as a little goes a very long way.  I also like the bottle, which is pretty enough for a dresser or vanity top, with a lid that is not likely to easily crack if dropped by accident.  Altogether a lovely surprise from Amazon Vine. I recommend this scent highly.	1
I agree with some of the other reviews that this perfume is strong. A little goes a long way.  I don't find it overly floral. The description says it smells like an English garden after the rain. It reminds me of scents Ive seen labeled rain. Its fresh but more of a mature fragrance.  The bottle is chic and hefty. The tortoise shell top is gorgeous. Its got large chunks instead of the typical marble and is predominantly a taupe. Id love jewelry and glasses in the material.	1
This is the first time I have used this product and I am very pleased with the results. I have only used it about 2-3 weeks but it does what it says it does, reduces appearance of enlarged pores. Will definitely order again.	1
My wife has been using this cream for over a month and she loves it. She applies the cream once a day and says that it feels good on her skin - no burning, itching etc. There is also no strong odor. All in all, this a good skin cream suitable for daily use.	1
It seems to me that there's a percentage of people for whom these skin rejuvenating products sometimes don't work. Unfortunately, with this product, I'm in that group. My skin was moisturized, and fine lines were slightly diminished, but that was it; there was no other benefit. In addition, it has added fragrance, so even if it did work, I wouldn't purchase it. Just too smelly for me, and the smell got on my pillowcase. Even if this did work and wasn't scented, I still wouldn't purchase it. At $50 an ounce, it's just too costly. On the upside, I had no reaction to this lotion. No redness, peeling, flaking, or rash.	-1
This Nuxe Detox lotion smells wonderful (I like lots of scent) and really makes my skin feel soft. The top twists to open and close. I've been putting on a few pumps of the lotion at night for about three weeks now; it doesn't take much to cover my face. I'm still waiting for my skin to look radiant and rejuvenated like having that extra two hours sleep. :-) At 65 it may take longer to work, or I may not see any results at all. But I do like how it makes my skin feel and it does seem moisturizing.  At the current price for 1.5 oz. I wouldn't order it unless I see some really beneficial results by the time the container is empty. I have no idea how long it will last because I can't see inside the container to know how much I've used.	1
I really have had excellent results from Tony Moly products and these are very good too. Still some large pores but they are too big for a sheet mask to cure. Don't expect miracles but you'll look very clean and refreshed	1
I was recently gifted this facial toner and so far like it very much. It's powerful, you really can feel it working away on the muscles. I also use the Nuface which works very well. I feel it's impossible to compare these devices, it's a matter of personal taste, there's also a huge variation in price points, the Nuface is hundreds of dollars more. Between the two, they both work very well yet are different. The Nuface is great as a hands on facial device but you cannot adjust the level of pulse as far as you can from this one. I started off at the highest level and can't go any higher as my muscles become stronger. I also find I don't use it when I'm simply too tired to stay awake after a long day's work on the farm. This device has a far greater range of pulse adjustment.  This device is much more powerful, I'm up to a level 30 starting out. You actually feel it working (I don't with the Nuface) and can adjust it up or down...whatever is comfortable. This is the perfect gadget to use when I'm too burned out to do my microcurrent and I also love it when I'm pressed for time or traveling. According to the reviews, it seems to either tone the upper or lower face better, I think this has to do with the shape of your face (placement of the leads) rather than the machine itself. On my face it pulses more on the upper part of the face. So I think with some minor adjustment (placing it a bit higher or lower) you can target the part of the face where you need the most rejuvenation. The sticky pads will prevent it from sliding around.  Where I feel this device is weak is with the headset. It's really designed for a smaller face. My face is small (I also wear a smaller hat size) and it still feels a bit too small....as if it wants to push forward and would if not for the sticky pads. This is a problem for those who have larger faces, or more of a wide face. I believe the company designed it smaller to make sure it doesn't move around but I allowed a few of my family members to try it (they have a bigger face) and they found it uncomfortable. Keep this in mind, I think that's why you find both really positive and negative reviews here. The facial toner is well made, not "cheap"" at all and it works as promised, I can see subtle changes and I've only been using it for a couple of weeks. The headband though, will not withstand laying on it, you must be upright to make sure it doesn't break. This device would be much more comfortable without the headband, I don't know why it wasn't simply designed this way, maybe they were worried that users wouldn't place the pads in the right spot, who knows? Anyhow, I do recommend it if you have a smaller or narrower face and if it doesn't work for you, I believe you can return it within 30 days so it's important to test it right away rather than putting it off and missing the return window.	1
Love it anti aging goes on easily a little goes a long way use every am and pm for best results also use with reine Blanche scrub !	1
This is a great way for me to touch up or keep my tan all year round. This works perfect for my fair skin. This goes on very easy. You only need a little bit. This goes a long way. This does not have a horrible smell like most. Overall does a pretty good job.	1
I think Xen-Tan products are priced higher than I would pay, compared to their performance. I did prefer this lotion to the Deluxe Weekly tanner, which came out a bit orange. This gives a nice bronze tone with a pleasing fragrance. It's not the easiest to use, although purchasing the mitt helps. I wouldn't recommend for first-time self-tanners or people who are just a little clumsy (as I am), but if you're wiling to take the time and care, this will give a nice result. It's not the longest lasting color out there but those few days look good.	1
I have been using sunless tanning products for many years to keep my legs from looking pale and to even out the color. My skin tends toward a pasty color which looks awful.  I like the natural looking tan that I got with XEN-TAN. The lotion was thick, creamy, and easy to apply. It had no unpleasant chemical odor like I've come to expect with self-tanners. Instead, it had a pleasant vanilla scent.  The lotion has a dark tint which provided an instant tan, however the complete tanning process takes a few hours longer. The resulting color looked great - my legs were tan, not orange.  I used the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/XEN-TAN-Deluxe-Tanning-Mitt/dp/B002UOCTSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">XEN-TAN Deluxe Tanning Mitt</a>&nbsp;and applied using a circular motion. It is not necessary to use the mitt, but it did a nice job keeping my hands clean and was easy to rinse out. I washed off the tanner after about three hours and the color was perfect and lasted almost a week.  I've tried many products over the years with varying levels of success and find that XEN-TAN makes some of the best.	1
This self-tanner goes on smooth and dark. It can also be showered off after 3 hours. One thing that I have always disliked about self tanners is the smell of the tanner after applying it. This tanner smells great, kind of like sun tan lotion. This only needs to be applied once a week and dries fairly dark. It works best when applied with the applicator mitt. This is a quality self-tanner that is easy to apply and smells great.	1
XEN-TAN Moroccan Tan Ultra offers an alternative to spray tanning for dancers who need tan legs for competitions (e.g., Irish Dancers). There are several steps involved, so if you don't plan to read the instructions carefully and put in quite a bit of time and work, then this won't be a good choice for you. I wouldn't go to these lengths on a regular basis but it would be fine for a special occasion (e.g., a job interview, a company outing, a wedding, a prom). You will also want to make sure you get the application mitt.  It's easy to see it as you apply it---start on the light side. The fragrance is not overpowering, which is another plus.	1
The description says that this has a tropical scent, but it actually has more of a Vanilla fragrance.  It has a bit of color added to it so that you can see where you have applied it. I felt like the color was nice and dark (a little darker than the Luxe variety).  It felt nice when applied and it definitely didn't have that nasty chemical tanner smell, but the vanilla fragrance is a bit strong. It was easy to apply and then go about my day (you need to wait a few hours after applying to allow the color to develop...I would also recommend waiting a few minutes before getting dressed so that you don't accidentally rub some of the tanner off making it look streaky).  This is one of the nicer sunless tanners that I've tried. Good color and easy to apply.	1
This product is pretty amazing.  I've been sick; vomiting and coughing and my eyes are a mess.  I have several days worth of petecchia around them (petecchia are tiny bursh blood vessels, they leave dark pink spots on my face, especially in the eye area) and since they have begun to heal and turn yellow and purple, I look like I'm about a week out from having two black eyes.  It is a look only a mother could love.  So I didn't think it would be worth it to use this eye treatment.  Why waste it when I look so gross?  But I have a party in a couple of days and while I am not fully recuperated I'd like to show up looking mostly normal.  So I dabbed a little on and went about my day, drinking tea, napping and it wasn't for several hours that I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror (partly because I haven't been looking, I feel that I look sicker than I feel).  I was surprised because some of the puffiness wasgone.  The shinyness did sorta emphasize the more purple spots, but there was a slight improvement, especially on my swollen eyelids.  this is just after three hours!  Also the spray of crows feet at the outer corners of my eyes is practically invisible now.  I don't know how long it will last.  I will try to check back every few hours, I have a feeling that it will mostly fade as the serum soaks in.  I can only imagine what the effect would be if I was in normal health.  I'm sold on this product. As an added bonus it isn't scented (weirdly the box it came in was, it smelled like walking through the cosmetics section of a Macy's, yech!).  I would totally buy this again	1
Very good, unscented cream that goes on smooth and I can see visible improvement after only about a week. Understandably it's a little thick so I can feel it stay on all day, absorbing very slowly, but it doesn't bother me. Very happy with it.	1
I have noticed an improvement in the skin around my eyes, including the darker skin under my eye as well as the crows feet that are forming. After applying this in the mornings after my shower, the skin feels very soft and tighter. Not super tight, but just looks a little bit lifted/firmed. There has been a couple mornings that I skipped the usual makeup around my eyes because i get a little too excited with how great my eyes look. It goes on easily and one small tiny pump works the whole way around both eyes. It does not have a scent, and although i get very close to my eyes with this cream, i have not once had my eye get irritated from it. The box does state that it is ophthalmologist approved, which makes sense since it goes so close to your eye. I've had other creams that were not, and it wasn't pleasant those couple mornings when my eye would get red and angry from getting a different brand of cream into it. Smart thinking VENeffect.	1
Sisters are doing it for themselves.  At least sisters Rebecca Booth, M.D., and Cecil Booth, beauty expert, have created an eye treatment "powered by plant-based phytoestrogens to reverse the signs of aging and restore skin to peak hormonal vitality."  Yet somehow, I feel there's a man involved somewhere along the line who has sabotaged their efforts.  I feel bad giving this a critical review.  After all, Madeline Albright and Gloria Steinem have told me we women must stick together.  But there's too much about this eye product that I don't like:  1)  It does not absorb into the skin well.  Even a very small amount remains on top of the skin and feels somewhat greasy.  After a few hours it absorbs somewhat and leaves the skin feeling a bit tacky.  2)  While the cream is sitting on the skin, it manages to migrate into my eyes and, although it does not burn or irritate exactly, the whole eye area feels strange and makes me want to touch my eyes.  Also, I don't have the best vision in the world and when the product gets into the eye, vision is even blurrier than usual.  (Here you may say to me, "Why do you apply it so close to the eyes?" and I will answer that I DON'T.  It gets there on its own.)  3)  I do not see any changes in the appearance of the area around my eyes.  No reduction of signs of aging or of puffiness, no more rested, youthful appearance.  Of course, at my age I may be a lost cause.  4)  This last "con" is not supposed to factor into the evaluation of a product, but, really , it should.  This stuff is more expensive than some of my electronics.  At this price it should contain fairy dust, gold-, diamond- and pearl-dust.  Does it?  Nope.  I'm sticking with my usual inexpensive products that are just as effective.  Bottom line:  Doesn't work as well as the claims and it costs too much.	-1
I've been using this for about 20 days now.  The problem that I've trying to solve is that of puffy, tired eyes.  I'm a single mom (to a little one) and I work too much and sleep too little. My eyes show it.  First, do NOT expect immediate results.  That's a ridiculous expectation.  However, with prolonged use, I've started to show marked improvement in the look and feeling of my eyes.  The puffiness and dark circles aren't nearly as marked, even though my sleeping habits haven't improved.  (Note:  I expect them to improve when my daughter is about 35.  Maybe.)  The lotion pumps out easily and you just need a drop.  Don't overdo it, or you'll wait ages for it to soak into your skin.  It's silky feeling and, important for me, scent free.  There's no skin irritation and it's very soothing.  In fact, I'd say that soothing quality is the one immediate effect.  I've been using it twice a day as directed and, using just a small drop at a time, I don't seem to be in danger of depleting the bottle any time soon.  At this price point, you expect results and so far, though not immediate, the eventual results are real and visible.	1
I love this eye treatment. It has no fragrance, which is perfect for my sensitive eyes. It definitely reduces the appearance of fine lines around my eyes and helps the elasticity of the eye area. It works so well on my skin. Love it!	1
I put this eye treatment to the ultimate test - four nights where I stayed up very late and only got four hours of sleep and woke up early in the morning. I applied it just before I went to bed (freshly washed) and the morning after. The skin around my eyes looked plump and supple - you could not tell I had very little sleep. In fact my skin looked very refreshed - as if I had a full 8 hours. You only need a little to pat gently around the eye area. It is light and my skin absorbed it quickly. No greasiness or residue at all. No fragrance. No irritation. I have used this for about two weeks now and I am so far happy with the results.  As to whether it will reduce lines and crow's feet, only time will tell. I will definitely continue using to the last drop.	1
VENeffect Anti-Aging Eye Treatment 0.5 fl.........I always appreciate products that will help aging, feel good,is nourishing, or that will pamper a person in any way........  I tried this product, and needless to say, I love and appreciate it.  It feels good on the skin.  I love anything that feels good on the skin and that helps aging, as we all get older everyday.  No matter how old I get, I will stay a "teen" or a "young person" at heart.  Unfortunately, our skin and our body doesn't feel the same way...so we have to do whatever we can to help the aging process to slow.  Just yesterday, I was thinking about some of the things that teen girls love to do, and that I still love.  I know I'm not a teen according to the calendar.  I am enjoying this anti-aging eye treatment.  Put this on two times a day.  In between applications, I try to do fun "teen" things.  In this review, I won't get into what any of those are.  I would say the girly-girls appreciate products like these more, but not necessarily, because most everyone wants anti-aging products, tricks, foods, exercises, life-styles, etc.  I love this eye treatment!	1
I don't often use something after I shave since I only shave a few times a week and my face usually does fine without it.  At first I was using the shave tonic sparingly, spraying on my hands or something else and wiping off, now I just spray directly on, and it's great.  Maybe not as moisturizing as lotion or something of that nature, but it smells really nice, gives an instant cooling feeling, and my skin feels nice and smooth/soft after.	1
This is a really nice fragrance set.  The way in which it is packaged screams class and elegance so right off the bat you are already intrigued.  The smell is delicate citrus that doesn't overwhelm the nose.  I am so cautious about what I buy for my husband and myself because I get such headaches from strong scents, but this fragrance is subtle.  It is almost teasing in its smell.  Just enough to make someone notice, but not cough!  My husband loves the scent and so far his patients have all been complimentary on his new cologne.  For me, this is a keeper fragrance for him!	1
I use this very day on my ends and I really notice a difference	1
You may look at the term "German engineering" and think it's another buzzword to sell a product.  I'm here to tell you by experience that it means something.  Quality & strength.  Two years ago I bought a "German engineered" razor & blades (Harry's).  I thought I was buying into a little bit of hype, but after two years of using it, it is by far the best razor (and blades) I've ever had.  The blades stay sharp longer, do a great job with no burn, and still holds strong to this day.  In just the short time I've had this manicure set, it has proven itself to be just as superior.  Just holding each item you can tell you have a quality product in your hand.  The trimmer cuts smoothly, the scissors are plenty sharp, the tweezers are easy to grip and pull, and the cuticle tool is good at what it does.  Caring for my cuticles isn't exactly my thing and I had to have my wife show me how to do it, but I could come around to this thing.  The display case fits in with any bathroom decor and can shared with your significant other.  The case does not come apart so cleaning it out after it's been collecting little bits of nail you missed, dust, and whatnot will be a little problematic.  But I'm cool with it.	1
This is a beautifully-packaged manicure set that would make a nice gift! I would not give it to a child however, nor to a person with declining coordination. The scissors have a very sharp point! I lightly brushed the tip on a finger and drew blood! I would prefer a blunted tip.  My only other problem is that the holder does not have a top and it's easy to knock it over and spill the implements, so place it away from spots where that may happen. Yeah, I knocked it over almost immediately... must be getting clumsy!  The clippers are on the small side and I would prefer a finer filing surface. However, the overall quality of this set is excellent. It's been years since I saw a manicure tools of this quality, since we do not have any upscale department stores in my town.	1
This is a very nice manicure kit and it comes packaged in a really elegant black box and it would make a great little gift. When you open it the individual tools are wrapped and you just take them out and put them in their slots in the wooden holder.  The cuticle pusher is excellent; it's my favorite part of the kit. it's very well-made, finely edged and precise. The file is likewise very nice although personally I prefer the files that have varying grits - this has just one and it's pretty coarse.  The clippers are very sharp and I really like them, but know that's they're  rather small and more sized for a woman than a man.  The scissors is also very nice although I would've also liked to have seen a cuticle clipper.  My main critique has to do with the tweezers. I am a bit of a tweezers snob and have bought many over the years. My favorite used to be the Rubis ones but even those have become hit or miss. This tweezers is very thick at the grasping-end which might be okay  for some purposes but it really doesn't grip very well and I found it didn't work well at all for use on  my eyebrows. I realize this is a manicure kit but the tweezers should've been more precise.  Still, this is an elegant little manicure station. It does seem a little high-priced, but it is from a top company and there's no denying that quality of each tool.	1
This is a high quality compact manicure set that contains a finger nail clipper, slanted tweezers, nail scissors, cuticle pusher/shaper and nail file.  I am very happy to have received this but it is ridiculously expensive, albeit very nice quality.  Moreover, it does not have a cuticle  trimmer. I consider a trimmer essential.  Am aware that it many advise against trimming the cuticles as they protect the nail bed from infection.  I do not trim very often but sometimes it is necessary.  A very sharp, small cuticle trimmer is essential for doing this with precision.  Was very surprised that a set of this quality (and price) does not contain this essential implement.  Much more important to me personally than a fingernail clipper because I never clip, only file my finger and toe nails.  The nail file is very effective, perhaps just a bit coarse (will probably become finer with use).  So in addition to this set, you will need a finer grade emery board or file, a cuticle clipper, and perhaps a mail buffer.  Because of the items it contains and does not contain, this set seems targeted more to male user than a female one.  I for one would have happily traded the clipper and the scissors for a cuticle trimmer.	1
Lovely set of manicure tools, sharp clippers, tweezer blades come together evenly. Curved nail scissors with sharp even blades. Long doubled sided file. Double ended cuticle tool. The stand is smaller than what I pictured, which is a good thing to take up less space in cabinet. The rim is same material as tools, covering a small block of wood nicely stained with anti slip feet. This would make a nice gift as well. Note to the manufacture, although black packing looks very nice, I think it could use a shrink wrap for storage and shipping as mine came with scuffs. This would only matter for gifting purposes.	1
This is a beautiful high-end set of manicure tools from the legendary JA Henckels. Our family has purchased their quality knife sets for years. Our family has been purchasing this quality brand since my grandfather was stationed in West Germany in the 1960s.  The manicure set is made with the same quality craftsmanship as the rest of their products. The feel, the weight and the overall substance of the tools in your hand makes you a believer. The case is Italian Leather and adorned with Swarovski crystals. Classy.  These would be an excellent gift for the person in your life that appreciates quality. I love this set and carry it proudly in my purse.	1
This is a handy little manicure set to have around.  The nail file smooths nails out instead of makes the edges chewed and ratty like some metal nail files can.  The tweezers grip even fine little hairs, as well as assist in applying nail wraps.  The scissors really are something to try out.  I've never used better quality manicure scissors.  They cut well and the sharp tips are good for cleaning under the nails.  The case is beautiful leather, very good quality, not plastic-feeling.  The crystal badge is a pretty touch.  Seeing the price of this set, though, I'm afraid to let it leave my house, for fear of losing it.  So it's my handy travel-size manicure set I use here at home.	1
I have used and own many JA Henckels products in the kitchen, but it came as a surprise to me that they make other products like manicure sets.  With prior experience from their existing products, I had high expectations.  The manicure set didn't disappoint.  From the moment it was opened it was clear that the JA Henckels name went into the craftsmanship of these tools.  They come with a nice leather case for protection and travel, although a little bit tighter of a fit would have been nice.  The tools themselves, a file, tweezers, and nail scissors are beautifully designed and crafted.  The size of the tools is just about perfect and fit well in most hands.  The file appears to hold up well and makes quick work with nail finishing, while the tweezers provide an excellent gripping surface with just enough bounce back.  The scissors are sharp and move very smoothly.  The finger openings could be a tad larger, but overall it's hard to complain.  Excellent tools all around.	1
This is the best German engineered Manicure travel kit I've seen, The craftsmanship is second to none. The bushed surgical stainless steel tweezers have sturdy machined tips enough to grab and pull one hair at a time. The sharp nail scissors are curved just enough to cleanly trim fingernails, the loops are easy to hold and comfortable. The file is made using diamond dust, it cuts well leaving my nails even and smooth. A black Italian leather case decorated with black Swarovski crystals gives this kit a nice presentation while storing all 3 tools.	1
***** These three manicure tools are absolutely incredible!! I cannot imagine anything nicer. The scissors are super sharp, finely made, and slightly curved; they cut so well. The tweezers are so precise and easy to manipulate and grab onto any fine material whatsoever. The nail file is small, but works well and at the same time is gentle.  The three tools come in a beautiful case with a beaded front. Everything about this set is quality. The price is astronomical, but it seems like the tools are actually worth it and will last and perform well forever.  Highly recommended. *****	1
This is a finely handcrafted set of beauty tools. The slim pouch with the black crystal emellishments is beautiful. You can tell that each item is well made and it makes me feel happy to use them. Unfortunately, the item I would use the most, the tweezers, had some kind of discoloration on one side and some scratches. So, although the appearance of one item wasn't perfect like the rest of the items...it still worked great.	1
This is a great eye cream that really delivers noticeable positive results.  It smoothes out creepy skin around thieves with consistent continued use in your every morning & night regimen. It also fades dark circles from under the eyes.	1
This eye gel feels more like a serum to me - it feels really hydrating and silky going on.  I've been wearing it at night for one week and I have noticed a difference.  My fine lines seem filled in/plumped and the skin around my eye looks really hydrated.  Update: I love this product.  Reduction in fine lines and NO MORE dark circles!  My eyes still get a little puffy but the dark circles are gone!	1
I love the texture of this mask. It smells nice and does make your face soft and supple. My only complaint is that I have sensitive skin and this does cause me to get white heads if I use this for more a few nights a week. Otherwise, it works great to moisturize. I have an oily T-zone and dry flaky skin one the outsides of the T-zone for reference. It really works great on my dry areas, especially in the winter to keep them moisturized.	1
This works well I have been using it for a while in conjunction with a few other products. I have seen noticeable improvements. It makes my skin feel clean/smooth/soft a little of this moisturizer goes a long way. Well it works well for me. All said it has been a good experience for me and is fairly priced	1
Erno Laszlo is a name I immediately associated with Marilyn Monroe. I'm pretty low-maintenance and not real versed in luxury skin care or make-up, I don't have a set beauty routine, but I do like trying different products and then incorporating in the things that work. I want to acknowledge that at this price range, I am probably not their target customer. However, I was thrilled to try a glamorous "sleep mask", plus it contains no petrolatum, sulfates, mineral oils, colorants, parabens, and Phthalates. Directions suggest: "Smooth mask over the face and neck, avoiding eye area and brows. Follow in the morning with cleansing ritual" -- easy enough! It does include a little spatula for scooping out the product, which has a gelatin-like consistency. There is a faint floral scent, maybe rose? Thankfully, it should last awhile, as a little bit seems to go a long way. I have been using it twice a week for two weeks now, and have hardly put a dent in it. You can feel the slight residue on your skin even after rubbing in, but not enough to cause concern for your pillowcase. My face does seem refreshed in the morning, and the mask seemed to soften and moisturize as promised. In our harsh, drying Midwest winter, I've seen good results. While it is pricey, I do think this Sleep Mask is great investment for long-term results.	1
As an aging woman of 56, skin moisture is becoming more difficult to maintain which is why Im so glad to have come across this sleep mask which locks in moisture while I sleep. When I compare the Erno Laszlo product to other brands of sleeping masks, I find that EL retains more moisture than the others. At $90, the price can seem staggering, but you don't need much product per use making it cost effective. Although the product directions indicate a weekly usage, Ive been know to use it more than once a week and my skin looks less dry. Moreover, applying the product just before a long plane flight prevents my face from dehydrating. And, the scent is quite pleasant.	1
So the consistency of this product really caught me off guard. I didn't know what to expect but it definitely wasn't a pink think oily type coating. I can't even think of anything to compare it to. It does come with a little stick too but its strange to use. Not sure I'd pay $90+ for this, maybe more around $30. I don't have wrinkles I'm worried about but I do wake up with a tight face and this lotion has helped that. In the midwest we have crazy weather and it has been so dry here. I do like that this product says to only use 1-2 times a week so it will last awhile but still the cost is high. I did not experience any irritation or mess from this gel. My skin absorbed it in nicely.	1
Well, the price says it all but sometimes price doesn't equate to quality.  I WANT TO COVER EVERY PART OF MY BODY IN THIS GEL.  It feels that good but I am settling on using this every week over my regular cream to seal in the moisture now.  I started using it nightly but once I noticed that it wasn't filling in the fine lines as much, I figured I had reach peak moisture.  I did that for two weeks straight.   I noticed an immediate decrease in small wrinkles on my face and immediate relief to my super dry skin.  It has a slight fragrance but that goes away quickly and it soaks into your skin rapidly.  I find that applying this over a small layer of regular night cream (let that soak in for 10 -15 minutes first) really helps keep the moisture in.  You don't need a lot of product to cover your face.  It contains dimethicone which is proven to seal in moisture.  If you really want to find something to lock moisture into your skin, find that ingredient and stick with it.	1
My skin loves this Erno Laszlo Hydra-Therapy Memory Sleep Mask!  I can tell, after just 10 days, that my skin is more hydrated, brighter and my fine wrinkles on my neck are smoothing out!! It has a light scent that isn't strong and is pleasant. It comes with a small stick to scoop your Erno Laszlo mask out with ~ you don't want to contaminate the product with you fingers ~ you don't have to use much to get great results!!  This product is pricey, no doubt, but my skin looks and feels amazing, and I'm here to tell you when you my age, 46, you become more willing to shell out the dollars to get real results.  I've tried dozens of products in the last few years ~ this totally rates in my top 3.  Great skin care is an investment in YOU!!	1
This is a very interesting cologne.  The manufacturer has described it well as going on fresh and then turning a bit more intense.  I have had about four or five colognes that I have used often--Polo, Gucci, Emporio Armani black, and a few others.  So this more 'intense' cologne was an experiment of sorts.  At first, I really liked the way it smelled initially.  The lime notes are quite pleasant out of the bottle.  In fact, for the first few moments I could swear it was very similar to Emporio Armani (which I like a lot).  However, the lime fragrance dissipates very quickly.  And then one is left with the 'licorice' scent.  This is much stronger and a little bit (a very little bit) goes a long way (practically eight hours).  I am less inclined to like the cologne for this reason.  However, I am less inclined to strong cologne anyway.  The strongest one I like is the Gucci which smells a bit like fresh sawdust (a scent I happen to like as  I like woodworking).  All in all, I think that the description from the manufacturer is accurate, and the scent is powerful but not overpowering.  I think I will try to wear it in the late summer and early fall months, much as I would the Gucci.  It reminds me of a humid day in early September.	1
Upon first spray the alcohol base really stands out but fear not as moments later the sharpness of the vapor evaporates away and is replaced by a clean, masculine fragrance that is confident and comforting all at once.  The aroma blend is well composed with bottom (dark wood and spice) and high notes (citrus and grass) receiving equal prominence together in pitch perfect harmony.  Vessel presentation is equally impressive with the generous amount of fragrance (3.3 ounces) contained in a hefty and sturdy square glass bottle.	1
While I'm no expert at picking out individual parts of a fragrance, but when it comes to fragrances for me, I do know what smells good and and what doesn't. Lacoste L!VE is one of the nicer fragrances I've tried, and I could easily see me wearing this as a daily fragrance year 'round. It is neither too bright nor too cloying, the fragrance lasts all day, doesn't over-project, and doesn't come across as having that awful synthetic metallic scent that so many current fragrances tend to have which give me headaches.	1
Comes nicely packaged - ready to be given as a gift without further wrapping. Everything about it says "money", so if the intended purpose is a gift, it will be obvious you spent some $. I think it's next to impossible to describe a cologne, but I will say this is very clean with some citrus notes. Masculine, but not heavy. Quite a nice scent.	1
This cologne comes in a nice package with carry ribbons, perfect for gifting. The scent is light and not too sweet, heavy, or overpowering. It is long lasting and only takes a bit to add a flair to the air! Highly recommended as a treat for self or that special person.	1
I love this Beard Oil on my man, its NOT too strong cause I cannot stand cologne...its strong enough to be rubbed upon all the time	1
I've used a variety of Porasco grooming products, and all work well and smell great.  This is no exception.  My beard quickly took in the oil, and it immediately felt great.  Smelled great too.  Before even asking my wife for an opinion, she gushed about how much softer if was.	1
I've been watching the changes on my 92 year old Mother's neck over a number of weeks using StriVectin Tightening Neck Serum daily  and do see tighter looking neck skin that looks better than it was. Using the well designed steel roller makes it easy to apply this product evenly, just squeeze the tube as you roll the wheel over your skin.	1
I love the roller ball application, it helps me get on a good amount of serum without making a mess and it just simply feels nice as it glides across my skin.  I do believe I am seeing a tightening in my skin but also believe that this is not a miracle worker in that if you have a lot of saggy neck skin this isn't going to miracle it all away.  But it DOES tighten and give a nice look to my neck.  It also feels cool while applying and I like that as a little refresher in my day.	1
I have been using the original Strivectin Neck Cream for years. It is one of my don't want to live without, skin care products. I was aware they came out with the serum so I was excited to get a chance to try it.  I love the roller application, the serum absorbs more quickly, and Im not wasting product I will just wash off my hands. It is just as effective as the original neck cream.  Both the serum and the cream are not miracle workers. If you already have a sagging turkey neck it will not make that go away. It will make your skin appear smoother and firmer though, not so jiggly. It excels at diminishing the fine lines and tree rings that develop with age.  I am a value oriented shopper, and I don't take lightly the investment I make in the Strivectin products I use. They are very effective and concentrated, so I don't need to use much. A tube or jar of product will last me about 6 months. I consider them a very good value	1
After about three weeks of daily use, I can honestly tell you that this serum has made a difference. You can't normally say that cosmetic products. I've found most creams feel good going on, but don't do a heck of a lot. The StriVectin brand actually produces results. Granted, these results are minor, but they are quantifiable. I've tried some other StriVectin products -- also to good effect.  My wife recently lost some weight, and the skin of her neck developed some fine lines. After using the StriVectin Tightening Neck Serum Roller, the lines have visibly lessened. Her neck skin seems smoother and plumper, and the lines/wrinkles are no longer quite so apparent. It does not get rid of them completely and deeper lines are still there, but they too seem to be diminished.  To use, pop off the top and turn the roller head 180 to ON. The serum will then flow when rolling. The scent of this neck serum is pleasant and very mild, and the roller applicator feels good when applied. I've found that getting initial coverage and then turning off the feed and just using the roller to smooth things in, is the best way to spread the serum around without overdoing it. It causes no irritation and soaks into the skin quickly.  The fact that there are noticeable results when using the StriVectin Tightening Neck Serum Roller is more than enough for me to recommend it. I wish it didn't command a premium price, but you pay for what you get.  ~ Kort	1
After a few weeks of faithfully applying this neck tightening lotion I can see a difference in the small lines on my neck.  The first photo is on the left,  no earrings, the after photo is on the right,  earrings on. My skin is incredibly soft in the areas where I have been using the lotion. The product is in a squeeze tube with a roller metal applicator. (It rolls on like a deodorant.)  The head swivels to an on/off position so no product seeps out between uses. It took me awhile to get the feel of how much pressure to apply to release the product. There is no fragrance in the product.  It is a bit tacky for the minute or so it takes to dry. It is not a miracle cream but I am seeing some results.	1
This is a real French-made men's perfume or cologne ("eau de toilet" or "toilet water" does not translate well into English!). We'll start by saying that we were already fans of the English company, Burberry. In a marriage, your cologne and perfumes have to be a joint choice, as both the person wearing it, and the one who has to enjoy it on the other, must be in accord. In our case, either one has the veto over a new scent. Our very favorite is London Burberry, but the company has a couple of other men's fragrances we're not as fond of, so we really needed to check this out in person. (There's some sort of deep, musky note, in a couple of them that the female of the family cannot abide).  We both agree, Burberry Brit Rhythm is a hit. That "deep note" is not present in this cologne.  A couple of other reviewers found this scent too intense. Not our experience at all. Naturally, cologne is one of those very personal decisions, and one person's perfume will be another's poison. However, the man of the family, being someone who doesn't like to smell like a French woman of the street drifting by, is very particular not to wear overpowering scents.  When you first apply Brit Rhythm Intense, the top note can be a little much. It's floral and strong. However, within 5 to 10 minutes, this fades into the masculine, pleasing middle and lower notes, and these are what last through the day or evening. We're no experts on how to blend fragrances, so the company's own write-up says it best (not on the Amazon page by the way, which is terse, but on Burberry's own site): "heart notes of black leather, patchouli and styrax resin and sensual base notes of cedar wood, incense and tonka bean."  By the way, sometimes we've read reviews by men who say they spray on 4 or 5 "shots" of cologne -- that would be too intense! A discreet 1 or maybe 2 shots at most, at the base of the throat, is sufficient. (Of course, you would never apply this under your arms, as the effect could be overpowering. A neutral deodorant for that application -- and in our opinion, one without any aluminum in it which clogs pores, is a better idea. Then you don't have 2 totally different fragrances fighting each other).  As you dig a bit deeper, you discover that different fragrances, even by the same company, can be unique. Often, each is created by a different designer. SO, having noted that cologne is a uniquely personal choice, the only way you're really going to know if you like this one blended with your own body chemistry, is to try it.  By the way, the man of the family already owns and enjoys&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/BURBERRY-Brit-Rhythm-for-Him-Aftershave-Balm-5-0-fl-Oz/dp/B00EYXNODE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">BURBERRY Brit Rhythm for Him Aftershave Balm, 5.0 fl. Oz.</a>.  Highly recommended!	1
Great scent.  Clean, crisp, not overpowering.  All in all perfection.	1
This is a wonderful gift for the man who would never spend the price of this fabulous Burberry cologne for himself.  My son is generous to a fault with his whole family, but wouldn't consider an indulgence like this!  He recently got a huge change from management to executive level, so it's only fitting that he have the "Rolex" of men's cologne!  Beautiful packaging, and an impressive "flask" - and my daughter-in-law is going to love the scent.  The scent is distinctive, but not over-powering - just right!  I have a feeling this will be my annual gift for the man who has everything.	1
I have been using this product for about 6 months and it does seem to have made a slight difference in the tone and texture of my skin.  Wrinkles seem smoother and redness/dark spots seem not as bad BUT...i was really hoping for more of a change after 6 months.  The cream goes on smooth and didn't cause any issues with my skin having allergies to it.  Overall I was pleased but hoped for more of difference at this price point.  I had another similarly priced cream that make more of a difference.	1
I love the product. I have been using it for 2 months now but, I still have blemishes and dark spot on my face. I hope they will go away soon.	1
Appreciation of or attraction to a certain scent is a subjective and relative experience. But there are certain scents that seem to have a near universal appeal.  Those include vanilla, citrus. cinnamon and musk.  But perhaps the most universally agreed upon agreeable scent is the floral group.  The delivery of a gift bouquet of flowers will always create the desired swoon to the recipient both for the delicate natural shapes and colors of nature, but also for the delicious scents they emanate.  The perfumers at Burberry have engineered a scent in this Brit Rhythm Floral that captures the subtle and sensuous tones of nature in just the right blend and strength to produce a near intoxicating effect.  Subtle but confident it conveys the same satisfying and pleasurable emotional response of inhaling a bouquet of roses and lavender. Light, pure, sensual, clean and natural are some adjectives that come to mind. Pretty and feminine are the next words that come to mind.  This is a scent that isn't reserved for a special niche as in a young business woman, or an evening scent or a mature scent.  It has a universal appeal that any age can wear in any circumstance.  It's neither sweet nor heavy but light and playful. It could easily become a woman's signature scent that a woman could appreciate on herself and her partner would immediately relate to and react to from walks past  gardens and ornate displays in high end hotel lobbies.  The scent is packaged in a bottle with an equally subtle design; a simple rectangular glass with a cut glass textured pattern on the surface and a background pink tint.  Like the scent itself, the bottle isn't overpowering or pretentiously trying to make a loud statement. It perfectly compliments this soft sensuous feminine scent.  Hopefully my description hasn't itself been too flowery, but as a male, I really like this scent and would notice and positively react to any woman that passed wearing it.  Honestly my favorite scent I've encountered in a long time. Again, scent and reactions are relative and subjective, but this is definitely a scent to get you subtly noticed and seen as a feminine, soft and positive female.	1
I love fragrance!  I'm not the type who is loyal to just one; rather, I enjoy using many different scents to suit my moods.  Given that, I was interested in trying this set from Burberry, a brand I had never used before.  I hate when fragrances have elaborate bottles that won't fit in my drawer where I store my perfumes; Brit Rhythm Floral has an attractive pink bottle with cute diagonal scoring, yet it is still in a practical rectangle shape.  Upon first whiff of this fragrance, I detect strong powdery notes.  These do not come across as "floral" to me (as listed in the fragrance description), although I do get a hint of the "fruity twist"--in fact, the latter reminds me (just a bit) of Victoria Secret's Love Spell, a very fruity fragrance.  I think that more than the floral, I am picking up on the secondary notes, more of the lighter amber, perhaps a bit of musk.  That being said, I do like this fragrance very much upon application.  The reason I deducted one star is that this perfume has very little lasting power--an hour or two later and it is practically gone!  I sprayed my wrists liberally this morning, and now (early afternoon), I only detect the faintest scent upon holding my wrist directly under my nose.  Of course, this particular gift set contains two purse-sized fragrances, so you can re-apply; this will be necessary.  If you don't mind having to re-apply and enjoy a soft, feminine fragrance, I would recommend Burberry Brit Rhythm Floral.  I don't feel that it is incredible new or different, but it is a soft, pretty, feminine scent.	1
This scent skews towards a pleasant floral.  I usually steer away from floral scents but this one has a sweet and crisp smell that I enjoy.  The scent lingers but does not overpower.  Ive been reaching for this bottle a lot lately!  The packaging is beautiful: this makes a great gift for a loved one.  This set comes with three bottles of the same scent (one large bottle, two travel sized) and all three are pretty enough to display.  Im very happy!	1
This is a very attractive gift set. The set includes a large spray bottle that is attractive enough to leave setting out on your dresser. The bottle is a raised diamond pattern. The set also includes two purse sized spray bottles that are perfect for throwing in your purse or gym bag. They would be great for traveling also. The box is very nice for gift giving.  The perfume has a fresh, clean scent. It is a lighter scent which I love. It is not overpowering. The florals are not too strong. The scent lasted all day for me. I had many compliments when I wore this scent. I think it would make a very nice gift.	1
It comes in a beautiful gift box, the large bottle is very pretty, the 2 purse containers are so useful and nice to have, it would make a great gift for someone that likes this scent. I don't care for this particular scent myself but everyone has different likes, I won't say it is a bad scent it just isn't one I would want to wear every day.  I would make sure the person receiving this gift set does like it though.	1
This is a beautifully packaged gift set with a 3.3 oz bottle and TWO rollerballs for your purse/travel.  I absolutely love to have rollerballs of favorite scents for travel.  The bottle is rectangular shaped with etched glass. It looks very nice and classy in my perfume collection.  Only negative with packaging is that the cap does not stay on well.  It rests on the top and can easily fall off if you're not careful.  This scent is very different from the Burberry Brit EDT.  I actually have a 1.7 oz of Brit EDT and it was my gateway perfume.  The original Brit is a spicier, muskier scent and I think of it as a heavier, nighttime winter scent.  Burberry Brit Rhythm Floral is lighter with a bit of citris - perfect for year-round use.  Official Notes are: British Lavender, Orange Blossom, Vetiver, Musks.  To me, this is a clean scent, like soap.  This isn't a bad thing at all - it fits well with scents I typically like (e.g. Michael Kors Daisy, Versace Pink Crystal) and I could see myself wearing it to work from September to April.  It is less overpowering than the Burberry Brit and it is great for daytime.  The throw doesn't seem to be super to me.  I can't really smell myself all day in the same way as I can smell myself with Brit or with Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb, although I know the scent lingers.  Overall, this is nice scent but it isn't really super special or unique.  I don't see this as appealing to true perfume afficionados.  If you like "clean" smelling fragrances, however, you should give this a try.	1
I adore Vichy products. I first learned of them through my Vine program when I received a sample of Vichy products and this LiftActiv was a part of that sample set. I used every bit of it and the serum in that set, which also included a night cream, I believeI want to replace all of that sample set with full sizes!  When I first ran out of the LiftActiv, I tried something else a little less expensive and regretted that buy. At $42, this isn't overly priced when you compare it to comparable moisturizers, and its worth every penny. Its not nearly as expensive as some moisturizers out there, so its a middle-of-the-road price range. And since a little goes a long way, and its a nice-sized jar, itll last for some time.  What a luxe feel when you smooth it over your skin! Its very emollient, so if you have oily skin, this more than likely will not be for you.  I could use Vichy products and nothing else and be perfectly happy.	1
My husband really likes this shower gel. It's great that it also works as shampoo! He likes that it lathers and rinses off well. It doesn't take much each use, meaning it will last longer than the average body wash. The scent is pleasant, without being overwhelming. Its scent is in the men's cologne realm.  Overall, this is a very nice, luxurious body wash!	1
I was excited to order this, but my nickname for this "Citadelle" cologne is now "Citronella."  Something seemed not-quite-right when I put it on, and I put my finger on it after I lived with it for a few minutes--it is extraordinarily reminiscent of bug repellent.  It has that bright, citrus-y, and somewhat yucky conglomeration of scent that does not make for a great scent. I went into this with an open mind; figuring if I didn't like it for myself I could enjoy it on my husband, but honestly I don't think it works for men or women; it's just not an attractive scent.  I do love a variety of colognes and perfumes, and I have a collection of about 40 different designer brands, but this one does not make the cut.	-1
I love the box, it has a sleeve that is sparkly greyish silver with gold writing and a gold symbol on it, then in a heavy white cardboard box with just the gold symbol  on it. The bottle itself is basic, exactly as shown. It is very strong, which normally I do like a fragrance to be strong and long lasting so it has that going for it. My mom tried it and was wearing my jacket and I could still smell it two days later.  However, I had several people ask me if it was men's cologne. I don't like it for me, personally I also think it smells like men's cologne. It seems like a strong woodsy scent.	-1
When I opened the package and removed the lid to sniff this parfum it didn't smell too bad. As soon as I sprayed it on  my wrist I wished I hadn't. It reminds me of a bad Avon fragrance from the 70s. I tried to wash it off but it's a long lasting parfum and won't wash off. I find it repulsive. Unless you can get to a store that carries this and sample it I wouldn't recommend buying it.	-1
I absolutely hate everything about this mask. The squeeze bottle that it comes in is much larger than the small amount of product that you actually receive. I was fighting to squeeze it out ON THE FIRST TRY after opening the sealed bottle. I finally squeezed a decent amount out and it smelled awful. Very chemically.  I spread it around my forehead and the burning started immediately.  I thought maybe it was just like a cooling menthol burn and it would die down, but it didn't. It burned my face to the point of being super uncomfortable and removing it within minutes of putting it on. My face is NOT sensitive. I have literally tried thousands of skin care and makeup products as I do a lot of reviews. This is only the second product to ever cause irritation with my skin. What is worse is that it burned for an hour after removing.  Maybe it has something I am allergic too? I've never found any allergies before and have none as far as I know. Even if this odd burning was unique to me, the product stinks and is poorly packaged. I am not willing to go through pain to see if it might help some acne. I threw it into the trash. I do not recommend this mask.	-1
This seemed to be less than helpful. It didn't clear up the skin, but seemed to make it worse. That may differ from person to person, of course.	-1
This product was nothing special for me and it certainly isn't the Anti-Wrinkle Treatment miracle!  I think the powder form seems to almost accentuate the wrinkles!  It also claims that it is foundation, well it isn't in my book!  Foundation for me covers blemishes or sun spots...not this stuff!  It is also difficult to apply as it comes with no brush.  I'm not a make-up girl...I've never had formal lessons on colors or make-up trends, but this is just an extra expense with no outcome to show for it.  Another negative is that it is so messy!  I used a brush to apply this and by the time I was done, it was all over the counter!  All in all, it is just another Anti-Fatigue, Anti-Wrinkle treatment that promises results, but fails to deliver.	-1
Upon trying the first time I noticed that the compact doesn't specify which color is for matte and which is  for dewy. I had to go back and look at the instructions. It turns out to not matter as neither one had any effect on my skin either way. Seriously, I could tell no difference. Neither the texture or the color of my skin was affected in any way. Curiously ineffective. Too bad the execution is poor as the idea is interesting.	-1
This product appears to be targeted for those who apply a lot of different make-up products to get that perfect look.  I'm a great deal more minimalistic when it comes to applying make-up and I honestly am not seeing a difference when using this.	-1
Sorry this product did not help my nail problem. Others find it helpful.	-1
Im going to have to go against the grain here.  I didn't care for this perfume.  The bottle design screamed out 1980s drug store perfume (think Electric Youth from Debbie Gibson).  When the perfume first went on, I found it to have too strong of a musk smell with just a hint of floral.  I realize that perfume is different for different people, but I didn't have the experience of other reviewers who said the musk scent faded and the floral smell stuck around.  I found that very quickly all scent was gone.  For me, this perfume just didn't have staying power at all.  I even put on what I considered a lot of it (4-5 sprays) and it was gone in no time.  I did give it two stars simply because the price is good and the quantity is great for perfume.  If it works for you, its a great deal.	-1
Too drying	-1
I tried this before purchasing Biotone foot lotion, and I was so disappointed in this. I had received a sample and I thought it worked well enough that I purchased the full size. It didn't do much for my feet. It was better than nothing, but it wasn't anything to rave about either.	-1
I use the red correcting crayon in this brand and it works fairly well.  This crayon looks like, well crayon, on my light olive complexion.  It may be that it is not for everyone but I wish that there was some guidance as to which skin tones this works with.  It comes across very light against my skin and it is embarrassingly noticeable.	-1
I have to say I was sadly disappointed when I received these. I thought they were going to be way different because I like Mustela products. I opened them up and the scent was very strong and I didn't find it pleasant. It says they are delicately fragranced or maybe I have an extra strong sense of smell but I was quite worried to use them on my kids as we use unscented and cucumber wipes. Having a girl I don't think you should wipe them with any scents so I did not use them on her, just my son. So as I was pulling one out I was also surprised to feel that these really aren't thick at all, they are very thin and quite flimsy. I had to use quite a few to completely wipe my son clean from a #2. They did wipe fine but I also don't fee like they were very moist but I think that's because it's so thin it can't hold much moisture. I will not be buying these wipes in the future. I have purchased wipes just like these at discount retailers when I was in a pinch.	-1

I keep trying micellar water products in the hope that I'll like them, and I keep ending up disappointed. Everyone (including in the reviews here on Amazon) raves about it, but this couldn't even take off my non-waterproof eyeliner.  The instructions on the bottle are extremely vague:  "Apply to a wet face. No rinsing." I'm not a big fan of makeup removers that you don't need to rinse off because it seems counterintuitive to me. You're trying to get all that residue off of your face, and what better way to do that than with a rinse? Even if I use a wet wipe to remove my makeup, 9 times out of 10 I'll wash my face afterward to get the leftover residue off. So I ended up experimenting a bit with this one: I tried rinsing, but that didn't seem to help with the actual makeup removal. I tried wiping with a soft washcloth and with cotton pads, and I still had to really go at my eye makeup to get it off. And even if I used a cloth or cotton with the micellar water gel, if I used toner afterward, I could still see makeup coming off on the cotton pad.  I really like La Roche-Posay products and I really want to like micellar water products, but... this just didn't do it for me. I still had to use a separate eye makeup remover on non waterproof makeup; using this on waterproof liner and mascara just made me look like a panda.	-1
I wanted to use this to brighten my skin a little, but this stuff burned my sensitive skin and I couldn't use it.	-1
I've been using this product the last 3 months and have not seen any change in my skin.  Like another reviewer mentioned, instructions weren't clear on the product so I went online looking for more information.  I was not a big fan of the texture of the product on my skin but did like the feel of my face after it was removed.  I was hopeful for results but have not seen any change.  Back to Rodan and Fields products for me.	-1
I received this as a sample to test, but after trying it once I will not be using it again.  The smell is light but persistent - it smells vaguely of rotting fruit and once you've wiped the mask off per the instructions, the smell remains.  I had to wash my face twice before I could get the smell off my skin.  It also left my skin feeling greasy but washing it helped with that, too.  It may work wonders on my skin, but I'll never know because now that I've gotten the smell and the greasy feeling off my skin I will not be trying it again!	-1
This product claims to increase hair abundance. I could use that. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me. While I didn't expect it to regrow my hair, I did expect it help not thin because of the claim that it would help attachment. I didn't notice any difference, and neither did my wife or kids. I was looking and looking hard for ANY sign of extra retention, and no change.	-1
I was about to buy rogaine when I was offered the PHYTO to try. I have had hair loss in the past, due to some medical conditions, but those are under control and the new thinning seems to be related to changes due to aging. Thus, I decided to try the phyto first. I apply it like close to the scalp and then rub it in, once must be very careful or it will be a greasy clumpy mess. Running late from work with a shoe in one hand, wand of mascara in the other, and trying to dump this on your scalp is not the way to go, patience and a bit of time are required.  After using this I didn't notice anything other than about the second week it started irritating my scalp and flakiness and itching began. Now, in addition to my hair falling out, I had flakes. I'm going to let my scalp recover completely and try something else  the Phyto is packaged in one use vials which are convenient and I don't have to guess at the amount.	-1
This are a bit of a puzzle, I think.  My poor, battered hands definitely need some TLC.  I cant actually do all the things I want to do in the garden or with potted plants if I wear gloves.  And having no dishwasher isn't hand-friendly.  But, while I like the idea of these, the execution is poor:  they are hard to use, and they don't produce better results than conscientious use of a good lotion or cream, and occasional overnight treatment with white cotton gloves.  Since they are one-use only, an heavily over-packaged, they also add appreciably to the stuff one must throw away.  And they cost a lot.  I cant see why anyone would be eager to add these to their beauty regimen.	-1
Whatever active ingredients in this didn't work on stopping the itch and didn't make any noticeable difference in helping clear up chronic eczema.  Also, this lotion is water-based.  While it doesn't feel as heavy and absorbs quickly, water-based lotions and creams do not create a barrier or keep in moisture as well as oil-based ones, which is important for dry skin.  Therefore, while a water-based lotion might feel good right after it has been applied, after the water evaporates your skin will feel as dry as ever.	-1
I didn't really see any impact on my eyes from this product. I used it as directed, for numbers months. Now it's collecting dust.	-1
I used it once or twice. Didn't see much of a change. It was weird to use and not convenient to have to plug in to charge. I watched a Youtube video to see how it works but although they glowed about the product, it did not live up to the hype.	-1
I am not sure what true firm is. I can tell you shea butter and vitamin E you can buy for pennies. This had better work for what they're charging or it is absolute fraud	-1
I don't have noticeable wrinkles on my face, so I use all my anti-wrinkle products on my hands, and feet. According to StiVectin I should have noticed an immediate change and then a long-lasting softening. I noticed neither. Complete waste of time and money.	-1
I'm in my mid 30s.  Not major wrinkles, but fine lines on my forehead, between eyebrows, & nasolabial folds.  Did not notice any difference after a month of use.	-1
Handed this to my James, being that it is for men. He has used it for a few weeks now and has not noticed any positives, but he has broken out more and his skin is drier. so ...maybe its mattifying is not a good thing	-1
Brush feels dense but they are very flimsy. For the price, I would expect better overall quality. While it applied the product fine, the bristles are flimsy but dense. Flimsy is really not a great thing when it's 20 bucks. And application was no different than a 6 dollar brush. Japonseque has some other fine products in their line, but this is not one of them.	-1
Started loosing bristles almost immediately	-1

This is a very expensive anti-aging wrinkle cream. Unfortunately, after using it for several months I still don't see much of a difference.	-1
This product is pretty much everything I hate about high-end cosmetics rolled into one annoying applicator. They create a fancy "cute" delivery system when a regular tube would have been easier and better, the company makes overblown claims and creates fancy words that sound rich and effective, but boil down to basic old-time ingredients that are easily purchased for much less in other brands.  Basically this is titanium dioxide with some nice added scents. Titanium dioxide has this great reflective property and opacity - they add it to light colored paints to make them opaque and reflective - giving a room a brighter look. Used as a makeup primer you can get the same effect, it reflects light to make your face look brighter and more youthful, and also adds an opaque "mask" to somewhat hide blemishes without having to add a bunch of heavy foundation over the top. It also has the added bonus of being a decent sunscreen. Many of the "mineral" makeup companies use this naturally occurring mineral.  The downside to titanium dioxide is that in flash photos it fluoresces white - which can lead to some weird results (do a Google search on titanium dioxide makeup photos and you'll see a variety of movie stars showing this effect).  So, why use it? Because it has a long history of human use and is considered very safe, as opposed to some of the more recent chemical-based sunscreens, and it requires much less product to achieve opacity.  Next question is why should you pay more money for this particular iteration when you can purchase something similar at your local drugstore for less than a third the price? I've used&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Physicians-Formula-Mineral-Wear-Talc-Free-Mineral-Correcting-Primer-Green-0-5-Ounce/dp/B004I55JT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Physicians Formula Mineral Wear Talc-Free Mineral Correcting Primer, Green, 0.5 Ounce</a>&nbsp;for a few years and think it works well to hide redness and other minor skin issues. It goes on light, doesn't feel oily, and seems to keep my makeup in place a few hours longer. bliss Mad About goes on a little heavier and feels a little tacky when wet. Once dried it doesn't add any heaviness and feels sort of powdery, it also seems to keep my makeup in place a few hours longer. In use, I see no difference between these two products, and the Physicians Formula does a better job at reducing redness and evening out my skin tone.  Third question is, if a company can't even get the bottle right, why should I trust the product? This is 1 oz. of product in a container weighing over 2 ounces, that has an applicator that won't allow you to access the all of the product unless you break the container, but that's not the worst issue I have with it -- The tube has a major manufacturing flaw - the "ON" arrow points the wrong direction, meaning when you twist the cap to "on", the container is closed. Twist to "off" and you may be able to squeeze out a thread-thin stream of product - or maybe not. If the tip gets even slightly clogged it's nearly impossible to get things going again.  So, does it work? Yes, but there are other products available at less than a third the cost that are the same or better, and even at that cheap price they actually have an applicator that works!	-1
While the product draws a very fine line, the print on the packaging is so tiny that it is almost impossible to read even with reading glasses. Using a magnifying glass I discovered three disturbing things: the item is made in China: it is not tested by dermatologists and may cause irritation: it does not carry the Cruelty-Free label.  These are very important issues and I am washing this eyeliner off right now because my eyelid is beginning to itch.	-1
I have tried make up setting sprays in the past, and all of them....every single one of them has issues...the same issues in fact: 1) not easy to apply...in fact the spray is so strong it can make you blink hard even with your eyes closed and what happens to make up...when it gets moist and you blink? you got it....smeared 2) it smells strange 3) it does not set my make up at all, without it my make up stays...with it ...it stays the same....it does not prevent it from fading through the day and I did have to reapply. 4) It irritated my skin a little, made it dry	-1
It pains me so much to rate a BLISS SPA product so poorly.  But this product was AWFUL.  I sprayed it on after my makeup.  First I noticed that it made my mascara run and then it locked in the mess.  I had to use baby wipes to get this cleaned up.  Next, rush to the car to get to work.  I looked in the rearview mirror and much to my horror my face was absolutely shiny.  OH NO.  Like mirror gloss shiny.  NOT A GOOD LOOK.  And it stayed like that all day.  Sigh.  I give this product a pass.  Not sure what happened, usually you can totally rely on this company for a kick-a$$ product.  Not this time.  :-(	-1
I like body scrub for my elbows hands and feet. I usually use a coconut one with a mild fragrance. This has a very strong fragrance - too strong. And it stays with you for a while. In a shower - not a small one - I found the fragrance overwhelming. I don't like it at all. As far as scrubbing, yes it works. But it is very liquidy. Not as salty as I'd like.	-1
First, I couldn't get the pump to work and eventually unscrewed the cap and got it out that way.  This has a lovely smell and feels great .. at first. I made the mistake of putting this on about an hour before bed and it made me crazy, it was so sticky and unpleasant. Any time I touched my face I had to wash my hands -- a lot-- to get this off.  Still, if my skin had looked awesome in the morning it would have been tolerable, but this was still difficult to remove in the morning (though not sticky), and my skin was fine but not amazing.  There are better products that cost a lot less. I like many of DCL's products, but not this one.	-1
I don't care where this was made or how "fancy" it is, it's the only new product that I've added to my skincare regimen and it made me develop milia under my eyes. I'm really displeased by this formula.	-1
This product takes off makeup but it's way too greasy. I need to wash my face with a regular cleanser afterwards to make my skin feel clean -- so what's the point of using this one? Perhaps if you wear a lot of makeup or are in theater, this would work to get all the makeup off but for me, a gentle cleanser with water works better. I may use this as eye makeup remover, but not on the rest of my face.	-1
I am a big fan of cleansing oils.  I've purchased DHC's cleansing oil many times and loved how it cleaned and left my skin feeling fresh and soft.  So I was very intrigued and excited about trying this product out - I received a free bottle to review. The oil itself is beautiful to look at; the product separates and you have to shake it vigorously  before using and it is filled with little sparkles.  The directions are to pour the oil on a cotton ball and swipe it in circles around your face.  I wear foundation, and even though this was the end of the day, there was still a lot of foundation residue remaining.  It took 3 cotton balls before my skin came up clean.  Then you are instructed to rinse with warm water and pat dry with a towel.  I did this, and it took a lot of water, and still my face felt greasy.  I finally decided that I must need to dry it with a towel and that it would probably feel clean.  But it still felt greasy after drying with a towel.  I used my favorite toner and decided not to use any night cream because my face still felt greasy.  Even the next morning my face felt oily (I have mature skin - I'm almost 60), so I washed with my regular cleanser (usually I don't need to wash my face in the morning) and went about my morning routine.  My skin continued to feel oily throughout the day!  I decided that the next night I would use the oil as I have with  the DHC oil: apply it to dry skin, massage and then add water while cleansing and then rinse.  Nope - STILL greasy! I cannot recommend this oil.	-1
I'd been using a cleansing oil from Neutrogena that performs relatively well, but I was on the hunt for something better--something that would remove makeup, not strip all of the moisture out of my skin, and most importantly, would not make my sensitive skin break out.  It is kind of disconcerting to see that the product so thoroughly (and quickly) separates, though that is remedied by a good shaking.  I very much appreciate that the product is virtually scentless, since heavily fragranced products tend to be pore-clogging, at least in my experience.  I've used this a few times and in a couple of different ways, at this point: First, I tried to use it in a manner that followed the directions, in terms of putting the oil on a cotton ball and going from there. The problem I had with that was that it felt as though too much of the product soaked into the cotton, and not enough made its way onto my face. On subsequent uses, I just decided to put the oil in my hands and then massage it all over my face, concentrating on my eye area, and using that method was a double-edged sword: it did a better job, but far too much of the oil had to be used.  In terms of performance, it's not great, but it's okay. It removes face makeup relatively well, but it struggles to take off mascara and eyeliner. I have to make at least two full, lengthy passes over my eyes whenever I use this, and even then, it leaves so much residue under my eyes and on my lashes, and the eye makeup that I use isn't even waterproof.  Here are the reasons that this product is not so great: even after wiping the excess off of my face (using tissue or toilet paper) and rinsing with warm water, it leaves so much oil behind that my skin feels way too greasy. Even after I go back in and use a cleanser, a lot of that residue remains and it's not pleasant. Making matters worse is that after each time I've used this, I've broken out.  I'm just not a fan of this product because of how it makes my skin feel afterward, how little of my eye makeup it removes, and the fact that it clogs my pores like nobody's business. Adding insult to injury is the price, which is patently outrageous.  I just cannot recommend this, because there are so many better-performing products out there at a fraction of this price.	-1
Of the multiple products in the Meaningful Beauty line that I have tried this Vitality Oil is my least favorite. The scent is a bit heavier than the other products, but that in itself doesnt bother me, I actually enjoy stronger scents. My issue with the oil is that unlike other oil products that I have tried it feels like oil, it sits on top of my skin and feels greasy and sticky. During the time I was trying to use the product daily to test out its effectiveness, my breakouts increased noticeably. My skin can be difficult; it is sensitive, combination and does have issues absorbing many moisture products. I do take into consideration the issues my skin has when I make judgments on a product. Overall even with my skin problems I did not like this product, the heaviness and greasy feel is just not something I look for in my skin care and the additional breakout made me want to hide my skin not show it off.	-1
I like facial oils and. normally i make my own as i can control ingredients and eliminate synthetic fragrances. I am trying to simplify my routine and decided to try OTC facial oils. This one has a nice texture and didn't make me break out, which i appreciate. After using it the first timy the skin around my eyes and my eyelids burned like crazy. I went to the box and saw it says don't use around eyes, and it most definitely means it. I am not interested in an oil that is so harsh i cny use around eys as that is where i most need the oil...side note, that one time use helped under eye circles! Too bad i cant use it for that, and i wish i knew which ingredient was responsible for the improvement. The fragranc was way to strong and harsh Lastly, the oils ruined my nail polish..normal OPI polish with seche vite top coat	-1
As a face wash, I guess this product is OK, however, as an "exfoliating" facewash, it is really quite bad.  First, the exfoliating beads are extremely few and far between. Typically exfoliating products are packed full of beads/seeds/etc. that slough off the dead skin cells and makeup. This face wash only has a few beads per dollop. Additionally, the size of the beads are unusually large and just kind of roll around without feeling like they are doing much. Finally, the beads oddly cling to my face rinse after rinse. The beads don't seem to want to come off until my face is completely dry and then need to be rubbed off by hand which is extremely annoying.  Again, the wash itself isn't terrible but it is back to the drawing board on the size, material and amount of beads this company uses for this face wash.	-1
I do not think that this is helpful for frizz. I think that because it is solid and it felt more like a styling gel.  I attempted to use a small amount on my fingers and just lightly touch my hair with it. It did not feel like there was anything applied. I then grabbed a section of hair and smeared it on. It was on there but it felt like it just stuck my hair together. I did brush it out afterwards but did not feel a difference in my hair. I will just deal with my frizz and fly away hair.  I received this item for my honest opinion and received no compensation for this item.	-1
I'm not sure whether it is the ceramicides or the zinc oxide (likely the latter), but I didn't like how this felt on my skin.  I'd use this on a day when I was going to be out in the yard all day working because I think zinc oxide lasts longer than the chemical sun screens, but I wore it to work and really hated how my skin felt all day so I wouldn't do that again.	-1
