removes scratches from DVD's and CD's great, does a good job of filling in, had lot of discs that would not play or lockup and a coat of this plastix cured it	1
Just receive it today. And apply this product to my old cars. It works amazingly. Shine like new headlights. But don't know how long it lasts.	1
I originally bought it for taking the fog out of Jeep windows but ended up getting a new top and not using it.  I then had a scratched Plexiglas door on my boat that I figured I would give it a try on and WOW, was I impressed.  In less than a minute the door looked better than new.	1
It works somewhat but not as good as I hoped.	1
Nice, easy install and who cares that it's plastic? It was like $14 or something when I bought it... for $14 I could buy a new one every year.	1
Had lower expectations about this product due to the cost. It has surpassed my expectations and then some as I've been using it daily on my truck for many months without fail. My only suggestion would be to buy a locking pin as it looks cool and people may want to steal it.	1
Fits right and it works as it should. Can't ask for more.	1
Works good, easy to install, good value.	1
It's been working over the summer. We'll see how it holds up over the winter. I ordered 2 and on one vehicle it fits perfect. On another it sticks out about a 1/2 inch away from the hitch. Works as both a tail light and a brake light.	1
I bought this with the intention of adding visibility. It does that, but I knew the halogen 1157 wasn't going to be bright enough. I bought this LED to replace it, which was the best I could find for the price:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/JDM-ASTAR-Super-Bright-5730-Chipsets-1157-2057-2357-7528-LED-Bulbs-with-Projector-Brilliant-Red-2yr-Warranty-Included/dp/B00WW28T16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">JDM ASTAR Super Bright 5730 Chipsets 1157 2057 2357 7528 LED Bulbs with Projector,Brilliant Red--2yr Warranty Included</a>. I also wanted to make sure my $10 LED bulb didn't get stolen, so I bought this hitch lock:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Trimax-T-3BLACK-Premium-5-8-34-Key-Receiver-Lock-Rugged-BLACK-epoxy-powder-coat/dp/B000W0RQ8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Trimax T-3BLACK Premium 5/8" Key Receiver Lock Rugged BLACK epoxy powder coat</a>. I also needed a power adapter to fit my truck:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hopkins-47345-4-Wire-Flat-Adapter/dp/B0002RNSKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hopkins 47345 4 Wire Flat Adapter</a>. Then I wanted to ensure it couldn't get any brighter and bought some red reflective tape to cover the insides of this:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Heskins-REF2R-Red-Reflective-Tape-2-34-x-10-yd/dp/B003EMZ24A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Heskins REF2R Red Reflective Tape, 2" x 10 yd</a>. This was kind of a hassle and maybe red reflective paint would've been easier, but less effective.  As for the product itself, I don't like the plastic construction and wish it was better sealed from the elements. I wish it was all metal except the red plastic cover, and wish it came with a quality LED bulb like I bought, with an option to add a hitch lock and/or power adapter to this product and maybe this would be a 5 star product. Other than that, it fits and it works, but I haven't had it long. Hopefully with the upgrades I've done to it, it will improve its visibility.	1
Has always been a great product to clean up lights and anything plastic.	1
The included pictures pretty much say everything that needs to be said.  As you can see the driver's side headlamp was totally restored by this product.  It ook less than 1/4 teaspoon of product and roughly 2 minutes to produce these results. I couldn't be more satisfied.  I was so impressed that I stopped what I was doing, drove the car out of the garage and into the sunlight, so I could take a few pictures for the positive review I planned to post.  Background: My headlights had a slight grey haze along the top 2inches of the plastic headlamp cover.  Be sure that your haze is not interior condensation as this compound will do nothing to fix that.  One quick test would be to rub a wet cloth across it.  If the haze turns clear it's exterior.  I used this product on a 2011 Lexis IS250 so the lenses weren't so old that they had become yellowed.  I'm not sure if this product is "robust" enough to repair lenses that bad.	1
I've tried a bunch of different cleaners for the oxidized head lights of my car.  NONE worked as good as this stuff.  No buffer needed!  Makes a world of difference in being able to see the road ahead of you.  Highly recommend!	1
Awesome purchase!	1
After I using this product I found that Novus2 plastic polish performed better at a lesser cost	-1
I've used a bunch of headlight cleaners and even 3000 grit sandpaper to clean my headlights but it was very time consuming. I decided to try this and it was very easy to apply and to remove.  My headlights look great.  I would advise any car owner to let the headlights cool off before applying and cleaning the headlights otherwise you'll end up with a mess.	1
I ordered these thinking they were a trailer side dust cover, but they are not.  I'm in the process of cancelling the order since they have not yet shipped.  These are for the vehicle side and if you read the description carefully it clearly states that.  I didn't realize that until I saw the reviews.  If you are looking for the tailer side cover you may want this instead. CURT 58750 Dust Cover Trailer Side	1
A simple but necessary accessory. These covers are intended to cover and protect the three male, one female pin connectors on a 4-pin trailer connector. Retaining loop is a nice feature to reduce chance of loss.  In a pinch, you can also stretch the cover a bit to cover the 3 female one male connector 4-pin receptacle on the back of your truck/SUV if the OEM cover has fallen off/torn loose over the years.	1
Nice	1
good	1
Work well.	1
Seals the connectors and stops corrosion	1
This billy step was just what I wanted. It is a solid step. I use it in a receiver hitch that I mounted on the front of my Duramax to be able to reach what I need to reach under the hood.	1
Fits great, feels a bit chincy, but overall happy with it. We shall see how it holds up over time, but happy with as of now. Very fast shipping!	1
Very good	1
This is my second reflector, these are great for added braking lights. Best price out there also.	1
Added a nice touch of safety to the back of my RV.	1
Works as advertised and fit the receiver perfect.	1
Based on several comments on Amazon about this product I decided to add another brake light to my Chevy Silverado. I live in a college town and with over 50,000 students when in full session, the driving gets a little crazy. So I'll do whatever it takes to make myself more visible. This brake light, added to the trailer hitch, does just that. As others have commented, I also noticed that some drivers stop further behind me than is normal. I believe it's because this brake light is the lowest, being in the trailer hitch, and some people stop where they can see the brake lights! Very easy to install HOWEVER, if you drive a GM product you'll probably need a 4-wire adapter and while you're at it, order either a 1-foot or 2-foot 4-wire extension. I had to use the 1-foot extension to install mine using the 4-wire plug adapter (GM uses 7-pin round). The tail from the light was too short to round underneath the bumper/hitch and come through the opening in the bumper where the plate is mounted. I did NOT want to run the wire directly from the brake light to the adapter. I then used two black zip-ties to attach the wiring to the hitch bars, keeping it from hanging down. NOTE: There's a hole in the bottom on back of the brake light, where the wiring comes out. Be sure to mount in the hitch with this hole on the bottom. Just in case any water gets inside it.	1
good light	1
Far better than any Armor All that I have used on exterior plastics. Depending on age and damage, results will vary and more regular application may be required. I have no doubt that used on a new car, this will vastly improve the condition and appearance of exterior plastic trim over the life of the car.	1
Flawless Victory	1
very easy to use and really removes the fog on the lenses	1
This stuff is great.  I showed it to a couple people and they immediately went out and bought some.  Really shines up headlights with little effort.	1
Keeps the water out	1
GOOD PRODUCT	1
Yes	1
Will fit Hopkins and maybe a few other brand connectors but would not fit my 4 way flat connector on my utilty trailer, not sure what manufacturer made my 4 way flat connector. However, it fit my boat trailer fine, seals good. No big loss, I will find a use for the other one eventually or give it to a buddy. It was cheap to buy, I won't lose any sleep over this one.	1
Excelente	1
Great protection.	1
YES!~	1
This works really well, we got two, one for the truck and one for the SUV. It even functions as an extra break light.	1
Well made and bright.  I'd suggest this for anyone looking for a 'forth' light.	1
Should have ordered one with a logo on it, but a nice light for the price	1
Cord was a little short.	1
not happy at all	-1
Arrived on time and as expected.  Produce is, thus far, working as advertised and expected.	1
I used this by hand to try and removed hazing and fading on a friends car.  The vehicle is 7 years old, and in Las Vegas, where the son can really damage headlamps.  It did a good job of removing most of the haze, however it might have been more effective with a power buffer, vs just by hand.	1
Fits and works great.  Fast delivery.	1
Got this discounted with no apparent signs of use. Easy to maintain, no surface rust  as reported by others  when kept clean. In fact no tendency of dulling after 2 months of use. The step comes handy to get in and out loading the huge cargo area in our Sienna. Gives more expensive look to our Ltd. trim, as well. I remove it only to couple the trailer. It sits low, so I cannot say how will help, if I get rear ended. Top molded plastic piece  provides adequate grip for me. Overall is worth every penny spent.	1
It does the job it is supposed to do.	1
So great for  the trailers, to keep the light cord plugged clean	1
Excellent product. Thanks	1
Great	1
Covers work great for keeping trailer wire harness out of the elements.	1
The factory end was  destroyed by my wife. So I have to put in a new end on the tow wires and a bracket to hold it from dragging on the ground and being destroyed again I also purchased these covers and put a little dielectric grease on the ends to keep corrosion from happening.	1
It would be extremely difficult to screw up this product.	1
Fits well and pretty bright.	1
great	1
Great Value. These aren't easy to find. If you're looking for Tail AND brake in a hitch light, this is the one. The only reason i replace these is during the winter when I back in to an ice pile. Bully makes a great product	1
Light shows up well at night.	1
Oh yeah this is very visible especially if you put in a large LED in it. Not too many tailgaters. Just wish it was not plastic	1
This is working well for our truck.  We have priced them and looked at these tail light for years. Glad we bought it	1
Was a replacement that broke when dragged the hitch pulling out of a gas station.  Works great.	1
Works very well	1
I used this all the time when I polish acrylic and its perfect.	1
Does not work on extremely cloudy headlights.	-1
This stuff really works....I had dull headlights and the product really removes the yellow film that builds up on the head lights.	1
This plastic polish works GREAT! I recently used this on a headlight restore and I loved it. It works well enough that you don't have to be an expert at wet sanding. I like it so much that I'm going to go find another project to use it on right now!!!!	1
Used this product on my 2001 Accord 2 weeks ago.  Headlights had been professionally cleaned 4 years ago & had turned hazy & slightly yellow.  Spent about 20 minutes on each light & the difference was amazing, other than showing age cracks the headlights are very clear & now I can see the road again After cleaning I used the Mequiar's sealer You Tube has a video on this product, and chanced on it.  I was going to use a 3M Headlight Lens Restoration System  but thought I'd try this first, glad I did,  The video stated that the product was to be reapplied in about 4 months, but it still is less work than the 3M product	1
Repeat buy.  The company claims it works better than the previous bottle, so I'll find out later.  If it works as well as the previous bottle, I'll be well-satified.	1
great product!!	1
Great	1
Arrived on time & in good condition. Was easy to install & should help keep trailer plug contacts clean.	1
works well	1
Sweet Fit!	1
KEEPS THE RAIN OFF THE CONNECTORS LIKE IT	1
I thought I should put some protective caps on my trailer plugs to prevent damage and corrosion. These are just what I needed	1
Fits perfectly and super easy to use. Plug and play.  Why not a 5? Product would needs strong plastic (The whole unit is made out of plastic )	1
Works great! Bright too!	1
works ok	1
Did not get the rust stains out of fiberglass even with repeated treatments and scrubbing.	-1
Great	1
The black paint used on this is not very durable. I bought this in January and left it on through the winter.  The black mounting bar became very rusted.	-1
As described	1
Very useful and seem to serve their purpose	1
Includes both male and female cap covers. Great buy easy fit, and snug fit.	1
Easy to install and works very well.	1
Fits tight to the plugs.	1
Great product.	1
Arrived on time. Work as expected. Keeps the contacts clean.	1
I put this on my Ford F-150 and it looks/works fine.	1
Works as intended.  I installed a LED bulb in place of the incandescent and it works fine.	1
Works as advertised.	1
Good product!  Having both the tail and brake light is great and it really dresses up an otherwise empty receiver hitch.	1
After about six months of use, the cheap black plastic around the lens started to break apart.  It is currently held together by a LOT of superglue at this point as I'm typing this review.  Waste your money on something else.	-1
All i have too say is WOOOOWWW! !!!! THIS product is legit works perfect seriously  works i did my  friend G35 an fee other cars there lights  came out perfectly looks brand new i habe pixs but idk where to upload them . but this product is so worth the money i didn't buy my own here went to a local auto zone n oicked it up 8 bucks , it definitely does the job.  Apply it 3 times each time wipe it for 40 sec. N wipe it good you will see results after secon wipe  3rd wipe leave the polish on headlight leave it for 30 sec for good results then clean it off. At the end pour some water n with a dry rag or cloth  wipe your headlight till ita dry and shinny. Good luck everyone	1
This will polish up your lenses very well but old, yellowing lenses will need to be re-polished regularly as the plastic is old and deteriorating and can't be fixed, just polished.	1
Another great product from Meguiar's.  I used this in conjunction with the 3-M restoration kit I bought at my local glass store.  It further refined the plastic in the headlights.	1
It is a good product. it helped to clean the headlights. IT DOES NOT TAKE EVERYRTHING AWAY, BUT IT HELPS	1
Easy to install, not too big in size,  illuminates very well.  This is an excellent safety product.  Appears to be well constructed.  My 1st Bully purchase, much better than a previous brand purchased.	1
I like the active features of this light. I am sure it makes my white truck more noticeable to the drivers behind me or passing me from another lane during turns, stops, etc.	1
Works just like the website desribes it.  Easy installation.  Good instructions.  I later found a very similar product at Harbor Freight for less money without a coupon and not on sale.....	1
this rear hitch mount with the chrome plate really makes my 2011 jeep grand Cherokee stand out in the crowd	1
looks great and provide extra protection to car, easy to install and/or remove, does not rust or need to clean	1
I bought to create some distance from all those people that can't judge distance and end up stopping with your car. It looks great, and it provides a rugged look.	1
Work well for keeping plugs clean.	1
Thought one was supposed to be vehicle and one trailer end, both are trailer.	-1
great cover for trailer plug	1
great deal and happy w/ it/	1
Hopkins 48735 4 Wire Flat Weatherproof... Not 100% water proof but definitely keeps the dirt out	1
I zip ties this to my trailer hitch. Fits snug on the connectors to protect from corrosion. Cheap price and you get two of them!	1
Great	1
great dust covers, does what it was designed for.	1
Perfect fit . Fast shipping quality product .	1
Can't restore my headlight even though the label said it can.....	-1
It's OK	1
solid product	1
Cleans yellowed headlight lens easily and they are clear again.  My Toyota Prius lens had started getting a white cloudiness on pt of it.  The clearer probably took off any original protection, but not many options when some of it starts to go.  Using Blue Magic sealer, but cloudiness comes back after couple months and need to redo everything.	1
I purchased a 3M Headlight Restoration kit because it was on sale, then I ordered the Meguiar's headlight protectant and Meguiar's PlastX. I apply Meguiar's Headlight Protectant every oil change, but unfortunately it gets a light haze before that so I apply some PlastX and it completely makes it look like new again. It also works for non-restored headlights if they aren't badly oxidized. Many times my friends ask me to do their headlights and they're only hazed I'll use this and 5 minutes later their headlights look brand new!	1
Works awesome. But is expensive. Also wear some form of respirator/paint mask when using this stuff. It is super strong and breathing the files in can't be good. But it works like a charm. No more yellow staining on my white boat hull.	1
product works as described	1
Works well.. not too big.. just the right dimension.. nice for added safety when braking and adds some light when just driving down the road.  Can't beat the price..	1
This worked exactly a sit was described to work, When my brake pedal was depressed it lit up...and when my Headlights were on it lit up.	1
Not only does the light seem to work well, it gave its life for us. It had an unintended use as a shock absorber. My wife backed into another car in a parking lot. The light was destroyed but no other damage took place. We'll be getting another one!	1
It fit nicely on my 2013 Nissan Pathfinder. I spray the clear RUSTOLEUM before I put it on so that there will be rust free.	1
it arrived on time ,it fit well. . it is well made.. it is very easy to install.. it fits a  2 inch hitch...	1
This is a great value for the money and is well made. I really love it. I have seen others that cost more and are not as nice.	1
This is really makes it so much easyer to get in and out of the truck bed if your truck sits high. Easy to install and remove.  Looks really great. This product is really well made as well. This is my second one.	1
works good	1
Let me begin by firstly stating any product worthy of a five star is far and few between when it comes to product reviews. I found this product worthy of such a rating.  My wife had a 02 Ford Escape and the headlights were solid yellow. So much that I was looking into spending a substantial amount of money to purchase a power sanding headlight restoration kit as I hand zero hope that anything would work and just be a snake oil. I applied this product about three times before I started to notice discoloration was going away. I found me a sturdy terry cloth and put elbow grease into the headlight. Multiple applications (guessing about 10) resulted in the headlights being clear enough I could almost see the filament in the bulbs again! Did this product take away the deep scratches and pits? Heck no but did not expect it to.! Common sense says a 13 year old light will need more than some cream to bring it back to original condition. After spending about 30 minutes and lots of elbow grease I got the lights to a nearly clear state and was highly satisfied with this product.  Took it over to my truck and in just one application it took off paint transfer off a brake light where some jerk with a black vehicle swung a door into the light. I was actually prepared to buy a new taillight after scraping and multiple washes did nothing to satisfy my OCD personality but this just saved me a bunch of money. Still feels like I have half a bottle left even after all these applications. Bottom line is I highly would recommend this product. Time will tell how long it will remain haze free but even if I have to apply this monthly I feel it is a great value.  Looking forward to bringing some to the office to see if it will fix our light bar problem in lieu of purchasing new lenses at a $500 expense. My guess is it will.	1
I applied to my truck's headlights, following the instructions exactly. No visible difference in lens clarity.	-1
great for cleaning vinyl windows like on a jeep or boat	1
Good protection.	1
works good	1
Work as advertised. Keeps moisture off the l attachments	1
Had to use this on a 5 wire connector by slicing the end off.  I have yet to be able to find a HOPKINS 5 pin cover, yet Hopkins are the manufacturer of a 5 pin trailer hitch.  Go figure. Hopkins no solution for 5 pin covers at my local trailer hitch store. For a 4 pin connector, this works great on my smaller trailer and a great cover for my truck hitch receptacle.	1
fit good	1
HAPPY	1
Might interfere with backup warning sensors because of how far the step sets back from the vehicle even using the closest setting.  This feature does make the step safer overall, but it is something to be aware of.	1
No complaints, but it could be of better quality. It gets 4 stars. Plastic gets a tad slippery when wet.	1
Delivery was fairly quick as usual with Amazon. The step is exactly as described. We bought a shell for our Dodge Ram truck bed so that my wife and I can travel and camp in the back. The shell has a nice rear door (opens vertically like an actual door) so that you can just step inside and close the door behind you (no tailgate or horizontal lift type door). The problem is that the back of the truck sits quite high and my wife had trouble stepping up to the bumper. We had previously used a plastic step stool to make this access but it was inconvenient as it always had to be stowed when traveling and was fairly large. The Bully Step definitely solves that problem. The tolerance(gap)between the step insert and the receiver varies by hitch brand I'm assuming as the little plastic wedge could not be installed exactly as per the instructions. Very little clearance in my case. I did manage to get it wedged in enough to function as intended though. Although we haven't done any real traveling since installing it, I have maybe put 100 miles on the truck just running errands etc and I can't hear any rattle or noise from the installation so the concept seems to work. The build quality looks good and there are no issues that I can see. Bear in mind that a 4 star rating from me is about the best I ever give as I reserve the top rating for something that far exceeds my expectations. My only hesitation to give it 5 stars is the fact that once installed it really isn't much lower than the bumper itself so it's still a bit difficult for my wife to make that first big step. It does extend back though which makes the footing and entry to the truck bed much more secure than trying to step on the narrow bumper itself. If it had been designed with a compound angle to position it one or two inches lower, it would have been perfect.	1
100%100	1
Good fro removing that ugly haze that forms on headlight covers. Doesn't take a lot of rubbing.	1
Meh... It works, but doesnt last too long. I guess thats the point. Keep me coming back for more. But it does the job, lasts a few week in bad weather, a month in good weather.	1
Finally found something to clean and polish my wife's face shield on her motorcycle helmet. Works Great!	1
good fit and protection	1
Very Nice	1
they fit and work well	1
too " hard' of plastic used , not flexible enough but better than no cover at all. note fill with dielectric grease	-1
I happen to love this item as it protects the other plug ends from gumming up with dirt/mud/pebbles and other random road debris.	1
works. You can use both male and female ends (which took me a while to figure out.)	1
This product is really cool. It looks good and is functional as well. I have it on my 2011 Pathfinder and I like the fact that it stands out. I hope that it will keep folks from parking too close in parking lots. The step is great too. I really like it and would recommend it for anyone who needs an extra step or just plain likes the looks of it.	1
It is what it is.	1
Made my headlights clear!	1
Works very well. Easy to apply and buff.	1
Meguiar's PlastX Clear Plastic Cleaner made my 10 year old plastic headlights look brand spanking new!  PlastX rich gel formula quickly restored the clarity to both of my headlight covers; which were yellowish before using PlastX. Apparently PlastX uses a microscopic abrasive that diminishes the scratches and oxidation in the plastic headlight covers making them look brand new for quite some time! I only have to use this product twice a year on my headlights as it contains ultra fine water resistant polymers that provide long lasting protection to headlights.  PlastX is so easy to use. I simply applied the PlastX to each headlight using a Meguiar's Supreme Shine Microfiber towel and worked it in before wiping it off by hand with the opposite corner (clean corner) of the same microfiber towel - in under 10 minutes both headlights were crystal clear!  Highly recommend to anyone looking to restore the clarity of their headlights!	1
Chinese junk doesn't fit standard trailer male end. Must be made for Chinese bamboo boat.	-1
Great product definitely needed this when i wired my trailer	1
Yes the seller did good . They show up right on time . They work good too. I like them.	1
Tight fit for both the connector on my truck and the one on the trailer.  Should work to keep the water out.	1
as advertised	1
they work	1
helps to keep my plugs clean, works good	1
Love this stuff. Works perfect!	1
Used it on the headlights of a 2008 Scion Xd. Did a great job.  Had to do a little bit of scrubbing, but the lenses really came out great.	1
Works great,good price	1
Great product to clean and polish clear plastic headlight lenses.. BUT be sure to use a protectant or clear coat with anti-yellowing and UV protection to reseal the lens after the cleaning and polishing, other wise the nice new look will only last a short time.	1
Having extra dust and weather covers for the flat four wiring connection is nice! Thank you!	1
I RECEIVED MY 4 WIRE FLAT WIRE COVER , Good product to keep your wiring dry and clean.	1
It is nice to protect and electrical grease the trailer connectors. With the weather the pins will oxidize without some protection.	1
No issues as advertised	1
Works great	1
Great product, great shipping, great price....Thanks	1
Not worth it.  I already lost one of these.  Pay more and getter the better one.  These don't stay on the plug very well.  Fit loose.  And then then large loop that connects to the wire that's supposed to be a retainer (when not covering the plug) is also too loose.  Completely fell off a couple times in the driveway before I lost it completely.  So it fails to protect the plug from the elements, therefore fails in its purpose.	-1
This stuff is excellent for restoring foggy headlights, tail lights, turn signals......Any kind of plastic lens on your vehicle.	1
It is so good	1
Everything works as expected	1
Very satisfied with this purchase	1
great product, liking it so far	1
Actually works. Doesn't get rid of all the dullness, but most of it.	1
Meh didn't do the best job for scratches on an acrylic aquarium. It worked but there are better options out there depending on the size and depth of the scratches	-1
perfect for what i need	1
Good stuff	1
Perfect	1
Is what it is	1
Great product, very good seller, thank you. Product received just as described.	1
Attempt to stretch that loop over your trailer plug and it will either tear off at the cover end or break at the loop. I know this because I bought two. These are fragile, inferior materials were used. Avoid.	-1
Kind of a ridiculous thing to review, but this is awesome.  I did not have a cover for my hitch plug and it would always corrode and refuse to make a good connection.  This little plug stays put and keeps the junk out.	1
Nothing special. Little loose but does the job	1
Works great.	1
Nice product!	1
A+	1
Works fine. Takes yellow out and some fogging.	1
Works as advertised.  A little elbow grease, depending on how bad the lenses are, and viola, you got some really clear lenses.  One of my cars was pretty bad, it looked like frosted glass, so I used rubbing compound first then this stuff.	1
this works great with small scratches	1
Should remove rust as it states - and frankly i cannot confirm that it did.	-1
TOP,NOTCH	1
esay to use	1
Perfect	1
Fits well. I used it to protect my trailer wire plug, and it works well to keep the crud from corroding the plugs.	1
keep it dry	1
A+	1
good	1
Works	1
Perfect	1
they do what there made to do cover the plug	1
Save your money. I thought that it would work like the mildew spray from the same company but as good as the mildew spray is...that is as bad as the rust remover is. It just does not work.	-1
This stuff works great . . . . . . . .. . . . .. .. .. . . MMmMmmMm m m m m m m m m	1
I might as well have been using water. Tried cleaning my motorcycle chain. The cycle gear stuff was way better however it also seemed way worst for the environment. It's a toss up, you want something that works or something that smells bad and is as good as water (starbright).	-1
Removes rust stains well if you dampen them first and let it sit for a while.  Watch out if you have allergies.  The fumes give me asthma symptoms if I don't ventilate properly.	1
Bought this product in an effort to remove some rust stains that were really set.  Was a last-ditch effort.  Sprayed the product on, and nothing seemed to happen.  5 minutes later, the rust stain was GONE!  Used it on a bunch of spots, and it worked EVERYWHERE!  Thrilled!	1
This product worked and is a great quality and value,  I look forward to using it.	1
It works, fixed my radio face that was very scratched.	1
Works as expected	1
Thanks	1
Just as described.	1
Only complaint was the loop.  It's a little big and I'm afraid it may fall off when I'm towing but it really can't.	1

use as directed with Meguiar's headlight restoration kit, 30 minutes to much better night vision	1
Best that I have used, but spend the effort to thoroughly clean your headlights first with a good quality, plastic safe cleaner like armorall glass cleaner to remove dirt particles that will scratch the surface of your lenses because you will need to use pressure and repeated circular motion  when using the PlastX cleaner. It does a good job in removing the yellow build up of oxidation.	1
easy to use and works fine... not much of a difference from mothers plastic polish...	1
good	1
Like having that added protection of protecting my plugs on vehicle and trailer	1
Great product. Keeps water and dirt from getting into my connectors.	1
PlastX is a very good polisher for the final step in restoring your headlights.  I prefer to use wetsanding to get the inital haze off and then finish the headlight off with this polish followed by some good sealer such as Blue Magic Headlight Sealer.  Below are pics of a set of headlights I restored on my buddy's Toyota SUV using the PlastX polisher after some wetsanding.  They now look brand new.  Be sure to use some form of sealer or wax made for headlights after polishing to keep your lights looking new long-term.  I highly recommend this product.	1
works not bad	1
Excellent product	1
Wonderful product.  Excelled all expectations.  Immediate communication and rapid delivery.  AAA+++	1
I use this to polish my buell motorcycles, works great on the color molded plastics.	1
Worked magic on an old navigation LCD, restoring the surface to new!	1
Holy cow this stuff works and works fast. I used masking tape to protect the surrounding paint and just used a microfiber towel and rubbed it in by hand. I spent maybe 5-10 mins on each headlamp and the results were fantastic. I restored the headlamps of a 2007 Honda Fit and a 2004 Nissan Maxima. The honda fit turned out great but i'll have to retreat my maxima since it needed much more work. Highly recommended.	1
good product	1
Worthless.	-1
It is what it is...	1
Worked great, good price, etc.	1
thanks	1
keep your connectors clean & corrosion free w/a little dielectric grease & these. I use 4 pin flats on motorcycles to hook up electronics so they're easily moved to other bikes or removed for security. I bought extras.	1
Fast Shipping, As advertised, Just what I needed, Thanks!	1
I use this on my headlight lenses about every 6-12 months - polishes them right up ... and, I have found other good uses for it too (since basically it's just a really-really mild rubbing compound) - ie: I use it to polish up my fiberglass boat's gelcoat, etc. (do not use on paint - like your car's clearcoat)	1
It is amazing how well this product works in relation to headlight restoration. This will clean light to moderate hazing, but not severe damage. Follow the simple instructions and this will not take long. A fantastic in-between or initial product. What I am about to type is important in regards to any headlight restoration product on the market. Once you remove the factory headlight coating, wether it old or not, your headlights will require regular application. This pertains to any headlight restoration kit, compound, or product. Think carefully before you sand or apply a product. "Are my headlights really that bad or can this wait?" This one in particular is the equivalent of a gentle rubbing compound.	1
Fast shipping/ great product	1
great product	1
work great	1
Both dust covers are only for the vehicle end of the wiring.  I specifically needed the trailer end.  No where in the description does it indicate which side.	-1
Top quality, Great price, Fast delivery A++++++++	1
nice works well	1
This is just what I ordered works great	1
Good covers, keeps moisture and debris out of connector	1
great covers	1
Used this on my buddy's 2000 Honda Civic Si's headlights that were foggy.  Worked the product into the headlight and removed it before it dried.  I did this four times to each headlight.  I then polished each light twice and waxed each twice.  The headlight looks brand new.  He is pretty happy now that he no longer has to purchase new headlights.  For the price when compared to a headlight "kit" that costs $15-25, this is a no brainer.	1
Get mothers back to black. Works way better. This one contains to much water.	-1
Seems like it requires lots of elbow grease to make a difference on plastic windows, maybe because they are kinda floppy. However, Meguiars PlastX works EXCELLENT on plastic headlight lenses! Found that it also does a good job on those little stick in the ground outdoor solar lighting panels.	1
served the purpose	1
Nice thick quality	1
t will work good when needed	1
Came with the grease. Just put half in each cap then install. Straight forward. Pay attention to how you install as one end has a little pocket area to slide the terminal in. If you have just a little bit of common sense, you'll be able to successfully install this product.	1
Whelp.... Rubber caps!	1
Great connectors	1
Tried other "plastic cleaners" but this really works. My husband travels 160 miles round trip daily on highways. The dirt & bugs were constantly a problem until we discovered this. It's a keeper! And of course, Amazon.com has the best price.	1
It's a quality product and it works. Tried it on 2 cars and got good results both on moderate and extensive yellow haze.  This bottle will probably last for up to 20 cars. Your headlights won't look like new, but results are more than acceptable and the amount of work is minim. If you got chips and scratches on your headlights buy the 3M 39008 kit instead. Apply "Diamondite Clear Plastic Headlight Liquid Armor" after.	1
No matter how many times I try to get away from this stuff, I come right back to it because it works so well.  If you're willing to put a little elbow grease into polishing your so so headlights, use this!  Pros: - Cleans very well - Polishes to a vibrant shine - Small bottle goes a long way  Cons: - A bit watery - Results are temporary unless it never sees the sun again :) - Not for completely yellow/hazed headlight lens  All in all a very solid product for lenses that aren't to bad.	1
Great service and good product	1
Very good, thank you	1
This stuff works wonders on headlights. wouldnt recomend for heavy oxidation removal though its made for light build up or polishing newer headlights.	1
Does what it says. 07 Camry headlights are nice and clean. But with any headlight cleaning product once you use it you have to keep using it. Make sure to use a cotton towel or what i use is paper towel I mean hard paper towel to act as a abrasive and help smooth the light out.	1
Covers work great. Quick delivery.	1
I didn't read enough of the description...This is a pair of vehicle side dust covers. Not sure why they'd package two of the same, but on second look the description is indeed clear. I just needed one for the trailer side. Still do.	1
This can't be found in any local or high end stores. Ordered this to protect my plugs to the trailer, this will help with dirt and gunk to collect in the plug so it doesn't need to be replaced.	1
Great buy & fast shipping	1
Works great, very snug on the connector.  Why they send two I am not sure??? As other reviewers have pointed out you cannot put the other one on the trailer side, this is only a cover for the vehicles plug.  But I didn't need a trailer side cover, so I have an extra.	1
These 4-wire dust covers are inexpensive and look perfect. I haven't installed them yet, but what could go wrong? They'll beat the heck out of having to scrape crud off my connectors when I use my trailers.	1
I tested this product on the face of my Sony Walkman with a foam applicator and it took out most of the scratches and scuff marks without much effort.  I then used it to remove the swirl marks in my black window rain/wind deflectors and within a minute or so of medium hand buffing they looked much better.  So for the price it works very well.	1
For the price I paid, you can't beat it. These things work great in winter to help protect the plugs from getting iced up	1
Cover straps fit securely to wiring harness connector. Great for keeping out mud and corrosion. Would buy again if the need arises.	1
thin and soft, yet weather worthy	1
These are good. Had one break apart when I hit bottom. Not sure if it helped or hurt.	1
Works great.  Keep the key with the boat or the next owner(or you) may be up a creek when you need it.	1
Excellent Product !!!	1
This really helped revive our RV siding "decals" that had been oxidizing.  It went on easily and did apply a couple of times in order to improve the look.  Wish I had started using this when I got the RV in 2007.  Certainly worked much better than wax.	1
super	1
Not a whole lot to say about this product other than it helps keep dirt & water out of your four way flat connectors.	1
Work as advertised.	1
do the job	1
actually comes with 2 covers,  very good product will buy again	1
Exactly what I needed to protect the wiring plugs on my trailers. Down south, insects will build a mud nest in any cavity including trailer wiring connectors. This cover will protect the plugs from the bugs, rain, and all the hazards of being outside.	1
I needed these badly to keep the dirty out on several cables I am using for my Mobile Solar Panel seiup.	1
ok	1
Did not purchase for headlights but to polish a acrylic aquarium after sanding. Pretty good stuff. aquarium looks new again.	1
For cleaning cloudy headlights, this does not last as long as the expensive kits  BUT you can do it in a couple of minutes and they look great.  I apply it every wash otherwise they start to fade again.  Its the difference of spending money and hours on the expensive kits that involve sanding etc.  OR just using this once a month.  Easy as pie.	1
NICE	1
I've used a few different products on my old plastic headlights. When I used this, I was skeptical because usually things that don't require scrubbing or sanding don't work. I did some chemical research and discovered that plastic oxidizes, and that's what the yellow coating is on the old headlights. So a deoxidizer was required. This contained an oxide, so I wasn't sure it work. But lo and behold, it did. Now, it didn't make them perfect again, but it did pretty dang well. It's a cleaner plus polisher, so it will protect your headlights from oxidation for a while. Now, since it only does light oxidation, the headlight I got out of a junkyard did require some scrubbing (with a scotch pad, it did the trick) to get the heavier yellow staining off. Be careful if you do that, because you could scratch up your lens. Other than that, it worked fantastic! I have images of before and after, and I'll put them on as soon as I figure out how. Happy lens cleaning!!	1
I find that this can produce some amazing results, but I am not sure if it is plastic dependent or what.  The instrument cluster lens in my 72 Vega was really cloudy.  This was the first time I tried this and the results were amazing.  The lens looked like new!  I tried it on headlight lens, and although it made it better, it wasn't as dramatic as the previous use.  I have used it on several items, and it always works, but sometimes it works amazing, and sometimes it is so-so.  Overall, it is a very good product.	1
Works great on our 175 Optimax Pro XS.  Just what we needed to keep our prop secure	1
NICE LOCK	1
as manufacturer denotes as should be	1
this stuff is the best for cleaning/polishing headlights are aren't too bad...this will maintain your headlights looking new...not for restoring cloudy ones	1
I had fairly deep scratches on the stereo face in my car. I got this and inside of 5 minutes, they were gone! I'd recommend taping around anything that you're working on, so you don't get it on stuff. I got a little white residue on flat black plastic trim (which came off quickly).  The only thing I'd mention is that my stereo face seems to attract dust like crazy now, but hopefully that will wear off soon.	1
Been using this product on the plastic windows of the soft top on our now 16 year old Mercedes SL.  It's kept those plastic windows  clean, even in the hot South where we live!  One application a year seems perfect for us.  Love this product!	1
This is a great product, well built and should last a long time. It does not fit all 4 wire trailer ends however because they are all designed a little differently.	1
I ordered these Hopkins 48735 4Wire Flat Replacement Dust Covers for my truck and trailer.  Good price.	1
They do the job.  What else can I say....	1
You never can find a wiring cover when you need it...for under $3, you get two covers for your vehicle trailer wiring ends...I used  to tape the ends closed, but the covers work just as well without the mess...love the add on items...	1
keeps the dust out	1
I cover every 4-wire connector that I have to keep the terminals clean. The little packet of terminal grease is very handy to help prevent terminal corrosion, especially in salty coastal environments. You can also use these for non Hopkins connectors, securing the loop end with tape if necessary.	1
Simple product and it works.  Seems like good quality.	1
No ones going to get my prop. Thanks Mc Gard	1
Great piece of gear for someone that wants to keep their expensive propellers away from thieves, or at least make their life a little harder when comes to robbing you!	1
Meguiar's plastic cleaner and polish works like magic. It's easy to use and even polishes jewelry. Great stuff with lots of uses.	1
I have been using this product for years for my headlight lens for my vehicles and its truly a great product worth every penny. The new and improved version works even better and would recommend it to anyone who is on the fence using it. I would highly recommend using a high speed buffer to apply this product for the absolute best results!	1
I have never needed to use this on automotive headlights, my lights never turned yellow or hazy. GOt a 2008 Buick and they are crystal clear. I also don't drive it with the DRL's ON.  PlastX works good on old plastic clock bodies, Clock len's,  toys and plastic toy car & truck windows. I used the product on a 13 year old record player dust cover last week ( i applied two coats) and now I can see through the tinted plastic  again.  I tried lightly rubbing on a  painted roof of a 70's Nylint  Pick upTruck I got on Ebay and it took off some lite scuff marks, but there was a small trace of red paint residue on the rag after I applied the plastX to the paint. It doesn't appear to be any paint rubbed off the truck, so it might have been oxidation on the rag? The bottle says not for painted surfaces, but this paint on the truck was 41 years old.	1
Finally got around to polishing the old, fogged up lenses on my 2005 ride with a 3M kit from amazon.  But I didn't want to go to all that trouble and just conclude after using their rubbing compound (which made a big difference after the 3000 grit polishing stage).  So after researching for some sort of final polish that would also protect the lens, I decided meguiar's was probably the amazon crowd favorite upon reading a bunch of reviews.  I used the same sponge head adapted for application with drill that came with the 3M kit (just wash/rinse well before using the meguiar product) which made this final step rather quick and easy.  The results were noticeably more clear and 'new looking' afterwards, which is exactly what I was hoping for.  There's enough left over to do the job many times over.  This product worked great, but I've got nothing else to compare it with - and I don't know how long the 'new look' will last so I reserving a star.  But I would certainly recommend it using the same process as I described above.	1
These were exactly what I needed to cover my trailer plug. The contacts corrode slowly over time and I wanted to cover them while the trailer is just sitting around. (most of the time) These fit perfectly and are doing the job.	1
The 4Wire Flat Replacement Dust Covers help keep the ends clean from road dirt.	1
Very satisfied	1
As expected	1
I'm giving the lock one star because the prop fell off when I started the boat. Luckily I found the prop. My son went into the water and found the prop. I followed the directions correctly and verified installation with McGard. When I spoke with Mcgard they said I installed the lock correctly. I asked them why the prop fell off. He asked me if I used never seize on the threads. I said no. I did use the special grease that the mercrusier manual said to put onto the threads on the shaft. He said you can't put grease on the threads thats what made the lock fail and the prop spin off. Not so sure I accept this answer, especially when the manual calls for greasing the shaft. I took the lock off and kept the grease on the threads and went back to using the tab washer and nut on the prop. I'll take my chances without the lock.	-1
Great piece-of-mind for my stainless Hydromotive wheels. Made in the USA, superior quality, sooper customer service. Have used McGard auto products for years, hard pressed finding better quality.	1
So far so good - was looking for something to get the thieves to move on the next boat and stay away from mine - I don't know what type of tool it would take to get this off without the lock but it would not be easy.  Also bought the MCGard 74036 Outboard Motor Lock Set to go with it also.  So far so good - don't know how a thief would ever get the prop off my boat without the key.	1
Stops the midnight prop thief. I recommend their outdrive locks also. It only takes 30 seconds to remove a prop and a minute 30 seconds to remove an outdrive. Definitely will help protect very expensive  to replace parts on your boat.	1
Does a nice job on cleaning and polishing the motorcycle windshield. However, for scratches in the windshield a scratch remover is necessary first.	1
Especially in plastic headlights and rear lights. Requires a little bit of "elbow grease" but you get a huge improvement no matter what you begin with.	1
Works as advertised. Good quality. Not sure what else needs to be said about this. Does what I needed it to.	1
This is a very good product however I didn't need it since one came with the other clamp bracket that I purchased	1
They fit perfectly onto the vehicle and or trailer wire when not in use. With the retaining loop they stay with the connectors when you are connected vehicle to trailer.	1
The plastic is a semi soft quality. so its very pliable and seems as though it would last along time without getting brittle.	1
A very basic, simple product that is nonetheless quite valuable for maintaining the integrity of wiring connectors. Don't leave home without it.........	1
If you want to get the most out of your towing lights harness or you truck harness you need these covers...I will never again go without this product...fit tight doesn't fall off with road vibration...Buy, Buy, Buy...	1
They keep the contacts clean and lubricated however they are both the same and not a matched pair for vehicle and trailer.	1
these seem more pliable and a little deeper so the entire connector is protected better thaan the OE that came with my truck	1
Used this stuff on my headlights, and it really does make a nice difference.  I wouldn't say that they look perfectly new, but they look pretty darn close.  I used a microfiber towel for my application, and it worked out great.	1
Your experience may vary, but even though I followed the instructions on the bottle, I did not see any difference in the headlight on my 2006 Mazda 3.  I am a fan of Meguiar's products but cannot recommend this one.	-1
Used this product to buff and finish my headlight after using the 3M 39045 Headlight Renewal with Protect-ant kit and the finish product was amazing. That was 2 months ago and the buff still holds. Highly recommended.	1
This product is fast and easy to install.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do to prevent theft.	1
Does what it should, high quality and provides peace of mind! I would definetly recommend this to boat owners.  This keeps my $600 stainless sport boat prop save when trailering or when it's on the hoist out on the lake.	1
This was the perfect "companion purchase" to the McGard 74018 Marine Single Stern Drive Lock Set.  This was purchased to deter thieves from stealing the propeller while the boat is in transit cross-country and even while sitting vulnerable in a storage yard or side yard of a residence.  Thieves like to take things easily that don't belong to them so they can take them to recycling yards for quick cash.  Why let yourself become a victim!	1
I bough this to clean a plexi window on our golf cart which was a bit hazy looking. It takes some elbow grease but works well and cleaned up my window and made it clear again. I would imagine it would be great on headlights (etc) as well.	1
This worked great keep my connection cleaned. It just hooked on and flip the cover on, i use it for Hopkins 48595 4 wire flat mount braket and connector.	1
Replacement rubber seal caps made for the Hopkins 48595 4-wire flat vehicle end wiring harness mounting bracket that secures your harness to your vehicle in a nice clean way so it don't just hang down making it prone to pre-mature failure and look bad!	1
Cleaned my connections well before applying the goop (looks like petroleum jelly and might be). Slipped the covers on and always have a good connection. Worth the money to me.	1
Cheap great item that works well. Use it on my boat trailer and utility trailer.  Keeps connectors clean and reduced corrosion	1
These worked great. They fit right in place and do not slip. They keep out everything. I have not had a good rain so i can't say if it will contain water or liquids but everything else fine.	1
Worked pretty well. I can feel when the haze is polished off because my cloth has less drag. This is not an "instant" cleaner, takes some elbow grease.	1
The headlights on my '06 Tundra had reached a point of needing to be replaced, but I read the product reviews for the PlastX Cleaner & Polish and decided to give it a try. My lights are not restored to 100%, but pretty darn close. Probably removed at least 80% of the haze and scratches on the clear surface. For the price, it's worth a shot before spending hundreds on new headlight assemblies.	1
These work perfectly on both ends of the connection for my motorhome and trailer.  They protect the contacts very well.  I highly recommend them.	1
Well they work! Easy to put on. Might not fit some ends that are not rounded. (to bulky to slide in)	1
Works as advertised. Keeps the connectors dry and clean. Easy to put on and take off. Safety strap keeps them where you need them.	1
I'm giving this five stars because it does what it claims.  Cleans and polishes out plastic.  This will take off most cloudiness in plastic lenses.  I've tried it on 4 pairs of headlights and it's been very effective.  Takes off more yellow than expected and makes clear lenses even more clear.	1
Meguiar's PlastX Clear Plastic Cleaner and Polish -10 oz.  Did not work well in the bath to clean the plastic lav, but may try this on my headlight lenses when I think of it again.  Thanks.	1
My husband used this on the plastic windows on his wrangler. It made the windows look brand new. They were so clear and clean. I have even used this on my VW for headlights and its worked out well. Great product!	1
Can't beat the price for an item that will keep the corrosion off of my plug. Well worth not having to clean the plug every time I go to use it.	1
Caps fit nicely to protect the splitter connection. I would recommend them to anyone that wants to protect the adapter.	1
These fit right on my headache rack, so I can remove it and cover the exposed plugs, water will corrode anything.	1
Good way to cover those vulnerable connectors for my trailer.  Works perfectly for the 4-pole connector and should keep problems away.	1
A good product, fits securely and will do the job nicely. Only thing I would say the round ring could be a little snug.  But it's not a issue, have no doubt it will stay where it needs to.	1
fit nicely over my flat 4 trailer wire harness and cheaper than at the local parts store. happy with them	1
Good to keep on hand when the other one goes, or install if you don't have one.  Add it to an order.	1
2 thumbs up! Went out and placed one on my trailer 4wire lead and it fit perfect. Would buy again	1
Works great for keeping dirt and rust off of your towing harness connector. Just be sure to keep the metal pins and sockets coated with dielectric grease to prevent corrosion. Mine have been in use for 6 months now and they are still like new.	1
Let me first be clear that the Everglass filler itself it top notch and works beautifully. I've relied on this product many times in the past and will continue to use it in the future.  The single star rating is simply due to Amazon's lack of proper handling of this material, as evidenced by the damaged cans they continue to ship even though several others have already complained about them, and the lack of hardener being included with these when they ship (they come in the case these cans were originally packaged in). My guess is that they crushed the lot and are still trying to sell them to poor unsuspecting customers. These are damaged goods. Shame on you Amazon.  If you need this particular item, my suggestion would be to buy it locally instead of through Amazon since they don't seem to know how to deliver this quality material in a quality way.  UPDATE: I returned the dented can that was missing the hardener back to Amazon and indicated both of these as the reason why I was returning this filler. I took a chance and exchanged the item instead of just refunding it as I would have liked to use this filler. While Amazon was quick to ship me out another can - it too is dented and missing the hardener. So, returning to Amazon and purchasing locally after all. Shame.	-1
I only had a small area to patch on my jeep so am glad that I paid the extra money to get this instead of standard filler.  I don't have air tools but was still able to sand this in little time with great results.	1
Just make sure you don't put too much on because you pretty much have to grind it off.  This stuff is awesome, best glass filler out there imho.	1
I used this Kevlar filler (Evercoat 632) to repair the lower back panels on my Ford pickup... ---  which had rusted out with 3-4 inch diameter holes where Ford created a lip on the bottom to attract mud/salt and subsequently rust.  I applied fiberglass tape (large hole)to the impacted area...overlapping the tape and extending the tape out to solid metal (sanded to bare metal!). ---  then spread two coats of the Evercoat 632 over the tape...working the filler into the tape and then tapering....sanding well between coats.  Granted, it will not eliminate the rust, but it will eliminate cutting and torching...at least for the immediate future.  For beginners, the 1 ounce creame hardener which comes with it looks far too inadequate, but if used correctly... ---  it is good for the container.  I suggest wearing a full organic filtered mask (not a cheapo) when using this product (or other fiberglass fillers) and nitro or rubber gloves... ---  fiberglass filler on your hands is bad news.	1
Amazing seeing the film come off the headlight lenses.  They look much better, 16 year old car!  Hope it helps me sell it!!	1
I could see an instant improvement right after one application to my Miata. It even did a tremendous job on my fog lights which were completely abused by the environment.	1
After 7 years, my headlights started to get a cloudy hazed. I purchased this cause of the reviews and seeing it on you tube. Couldn't haven't been better. Very easy to use, highly recommend it.	1
I adapted this to be used on a 3 inch wide tube. Essentially I heated up the metal with some map gas, and then straightened out the little dog leg on each support some with a 3lb sledge hammer and anvil.  This allow me to use the existing four-inch keel roller. Took about 15 min. to modify, and then I painted the entire thing with black enamel to match my trailer. My only complaint is it only came with one axle or pal nut, and the 5/8 diameter ones are not easy to come by at the local hardware store. I ended up ordering a few off of eBay which cost me an extra five dollars with shipping. I guess I could have sent this back, but I just wanted to be done with it. The rubber is a little bit soft, but keel rollers are only about four or five dollars to replace, and they do tend to harden over time by themselves. If you put a lot of weight on this from the get-go you may end up with a flat spot, so be advised.	1
Super easy to apply. Just apply to clean microfiber towel... rub on.. let it haze up, then wipe off with fresh towel. It cleans up lenses, but the haze comes back pretty quick. I am surprised it worked at all. but having to re-apply at least a couple of times a month is a pain.  I should say, my headlights don't have any damage, or any other issues that is causing it to rehaze. Its on the exterior, not the interior of the lens.	1
I polish my headlights and taillights using PlastXcafter each oil change, my car is a 2008 RAV and they look like the day I bought them. I also did my headlights on my truck because they were cloudy , I polished them and they also came out looking new.  There's nothing better for plastics. PERIOD!	1
I tried this on a old turntable dustcover and doing it by hand it took a while, I put it on the floor and watched a movie while i did it, but it worked great. It has fixed some scratched CD's that skipped too.	1
Rather than pay three times as much for a multi-step kit that can take up to an hour of work per headlight, I opted for this inexpensive and simple alternative.  Not only did it WORK on my sister's 2007 Corolla's 100,000 mile, VERY yellowed and foggy headlight covers, it worked in just FIVE MINUTES PER COVER!  And I used only 1/3rd of the 10oz bottle!  So my cost was $2 and time was ten minutes.  The covers went from under 50% light transmission to at least 90%.  With the lights on at night, standing in front of the car, you can still see a bit off fogginess, but when driving the lights work great!  I used a small foam pad from a car wax kit for application and a small, slightly damp terry cloth hand towel.  I used the towel to promptly wipe off any cleaner that got on the paint, and after rubbing generous amounts of cleaner on each lens cover for five minutes, I wiped the cover dry with the towel while the cleaner was still wet, as directed on the bottle.  It can't get easier than this!  Of course, the result can only improve if you want to spend more time scrubbing, or, if you want perfection, spend the money and even more time on those other kits.  See my "before" and "after" photos above!  ADDENDUM (11 Jul 13): I just found on EHOW dot COM that a 3 to 1 ratio of toothpaste to baking soda will do the same job.  Wash lenses first with dish soap and afterwards with baking soda in water (rinse well after each wash).  I'll try it and let ya know!	1
I have used this on my motorcycle windshield and helmet as well as on the headlights of my minivan and it does a great job of clearing these up as well as helping to sheet the rain off.  I would recommend it to anyone for any of these uses.	1
I used this to fill in holes on a porcelain tub as well as to partially re-attach the lower valance on my 2002 F150 which tore a little bit when I backed through a pile of ice.  The can arrived slightly dented, but it came with the hardener and there were no leaks, so I was happy enough.  I followed the directions for the bathtub repair and noticed that I had about 2-3 minutes to set it in place before it hardened and the remaining became unusable.  So, when I went to repair the valance on my truck, I used less (about 2/3 of what the directions recommend) hardener and was able to use it for about 5-6 minutes before it hardened, which was more than enough time for my needs.  There is still a ton of this left and I still have a fair amount of hardener to boot.  I tried sanding what I applied to the bathtub and it tore up the sandpaper I was using (I believe it was 120 grit) as well as a sanding sponge that I was using (I believe it was 100 grit).  The only thing that worked for me was the 40 grit sandpaper, but even that wore quickly.  I believe that I used too much hardener, as this stuff is tough!  Oh, and the holes I filled ranged from the size of a dime to just over the size of a nickle.  Due to the thickness of the product, I was able to use it as a filler without any support underneath it and now those holes are as solid as the rest of the tub.  Very impressive product and now I'm looking for other projects to use it with!	1
OK	1
very good for filling rusted out portions of vehicles, good quality product.	1
I started off having no idea what I was doing, but knew I needed to get my spoiler attached much more securely and in a more paintable fashion than I previously had it.  This stuff sounded like it fit the bill and the result seems to confirm my suspicion.  A day later, knocking on my ABS plastic spoiler produces a metallic clank because this body filler is THAT hard when fully dry.  Good stuff.  Some things worthy of noting.  For a job as small as a spoiler, you need to make tiny batches of filler and spread them on quickly.  The filler will harden past any hope of applying it in roughly 2 minutes.  As long as you have some kind of a hand file, a large variety of sand paper, and you work quickly, you can cover up your messes without much trouble.  Actually, I didn't find the filler difficult at all to sand down to hand smooth, but I wasn't exactly targeting show car quality work and I was hacking on it before it was 100% cured.  If I weren't working on my daily, I'd have used more filler and taken another hour or two to do the job right.  The can SHOULD come with a tube of hardener which is more than sufficient for a small project.  If you intend to put a dent in the can, you'd better buy another tube of hardener.	1
Worked great for patching up my Jeep	1
You can use the M105 with a polisher and it does if not the same job, a better job.  This stuff is good, just the M105 you can use on your entire car and it does just as good on the headlights (at least when using a porter cable polisher)	1
My Headlights have been getting the cloudy look to them and I bought some of the Turtle Headlight Repair (doesn't do anything) and I used this product. It made my headlights look brand new!!!	1
I have used PlastX on my cars and my friends' cars as well.  This is the easiest way to polish our headlights to make them look great again.  I have a 5 year old Toyota Sienna and I park it outside so the LA sun is just punishing the plastic headlight and tailight cover.  Once a month, I apply a little PlastX to my headlights and it keeps it looking new.  I just apply a little on a rag and I spread it on the headlight.  I then proceed to buff it with another rag.  I do not use force, just like buffing the wax on my car.  And then I remove any excess.  Very simple, and it really works.  My car looks better than when it drove it out of the dealer's lot.  I use Mequiar's other products to keep my car looking new.  No need to buy a new car because my car looks really good.	1
I literally went outside with 2 rags and a bottle of this stuff, and within 5 minutes both my headlights looked atleast 30% clearer.  It took nearly no effort at all, rub on, wipe off, and wow, the difference was noticeable instantly.  I have 95% of the bottle left too.... I am going to use it on friends/family headlights and see what else I can use it on.  But if you are looking to clean headlights, give this a shot before spending much more money. Ive seen restore kits and all that, but unless you think your headlights really need it, and your lights are in really really bad shape, this will probably work fine.  My car is 9 years old, and this was the first time restoring the headlights, and I was almost amazed how this stuff gets all that blur right out and makes them look almost new again.	1
Bought and used this on faded black plastics on my car. Works great and brought back the color and works well on headlight capsules too!	1
This is supposed to be superior to the "Kleenex" brand. (Bondo)  I used it and it went on very good. Shipping was fast.	1
This product works great for filling in gaps that are too large for fillers. fast shipment.	1
work great repair bumper	1
Very strong and durable, tougher to sand than regular filler but that's because it's reinforced. Overall happy!	1
I used my entire bottle of mothers plastic polish on my 08 Honda Fit's headlights, taillights, sidemarkers, and visors and was MUCH MUCH better in all categories. Application method, composition, protection, and longevity. Spend a buck or 2 more and get yourself the Mother's brand. The mother's brand applies like standard wax, wax on, haze, wax off. The Mequiar's goes on and has to be buffed off before it dries, I am not fond of this method of application.  I am not knocking Mequiar's because they have other amazing car products that I use, including NXT paste, but there is a better alternative to this.	-1
I used this for three year old headlights and while they didn't look bad, they really shine with this product.  I would recommend this first for any kind of plexiglass parts of your car.	1
dont buy this product , go get your car detailed.  the car wash guys use better products, this product sucks.	-1
I noticed no beading and the same result as not having this on my visor. I tried a few applications to no avail.	-1
Not as I imagined, but it helps for small areas only, can't let you feel big deference before and after using it.. this is my own experience, maybe because i'm not professional and it need someone with certain kind of experience to do it right. at the end seller suppose to provide you after purchasing with needed information about how to use this product properly well	-1
Did the job with very little effort!  Both Headlights and Turn signal lenses are clear again!  I recommend this product!	1
GIves a nice polish. Works for fine scratches. Won't really do much for bad oxidation. You'll need polishing compound, at a minimum, for that. But for upkeep of plastic in good condition it seems to work well.	1
If you need additional polish this is the ticket..use with rag or buffer...does the job.  Follow directions and you will get great results.	1
This stuff really works. buy this if you want plastic to really shine and it brings the best out of the covering.	1
Worked on my 2005 honda accord. Had faded lens, and cleared up my headlights super fast. Couldn't be more happy.	1
Excellent for removing light / light moderate haziness from plastic headlight and tail light lenses. I also use on my instrument panel lenses to keep them crystal clear. For more severe haziness, a more intense cleaner and polish will be needed before using this for further maintaining and protection.	1
Used this product on my motorcycle windshield and it worked great.  The plastic was nice & clean, wiped off easily and no residue.  Will be ordering this again.	1
The furniture movers somehow dripped gooey stuff on the glass of my front-loading clothes washer. Then they tried scrubbing it off with something that scratched the window so that it is almost opaque. Worse, they only scrubbed about a third of the window. The rest wasn't as opaque.  They won't pay to replace the whole window because the machine works, you just can't see the clothes spinning around.  So I got this cleaning stuff to try to polish the window back to clarity. It took a few tries and quite careful polishing to blend the scratched part into the undamaged part, but it worked!  The bottle says it can also be used on motorcycle visors. Maybe I should try to polish my drugstore glasses which are all scratched? (My headlights are fine, all nice and clear, don't need polishing.) Too bad this stuff is not intended for real glass. I have lots of scratched up glass items.	1
Again, does' what it claims to do in a matter of minutes. Be careful to apply painter's tape around the area to be polished as not to damage paint. (I use the blue 1.5"-2" painter's tape because it leaves no residue). Good shopping to you!	1
It works beautifully!! Just like car polish but for plastics. The rag turned yellow from the oxidation. About as close to new as one can get without paying 600 to 800 bucks replacing both lenses. A restoration kit should be used first for really bad lenses. Then this stuff will take off what the kit leaves behind. It works great!!!!	1
I used this product a few times on one of my headlights that was starting to oxidize and it covered up the problem, but within a few washes and a few more applications, it actually made the oxidation worse. Maybe I used it incorrectly, I'm not really sure, but I haven't used it since. That headlight was eventually restored by a professional and then replaced as it got damaged in an accident. I do like Meguiars products, just not this one. My other headlight is starting to look a little shabby and I decided to use Ultimate Compound by Meguiars and it has done a much better job. I also used it on my girlfriend's and dad's headlights and the Ultimate Compound really cleared away the oxidation. I then followed that with some carnauba wax, very nice.	-1
works great	1
Handy and easy to use	1
Good stuff	1
not much faith in the top twist to hold the ball on, but have been pleased with it so far.	1
The lock and unlock button is on the top of the ball and is really easy to unlock. So if your going a long distance and feel that you may have hit a few bumps that could giggle everything you will feel uncomfortable with not knowing if the ball is locked or not or for how long. Its not even a full turn to lock either its MAYBE 1/10 of a turn.	-1
works just as good as the turtle wax lens restoration kit, but you get about 3x more polish and its cheaper!	1
I had to grab one at the local store for $10 but for its size, I can't really complain.  Not long ago I purchased 3M's headlight polishing kit and ran out of the plastic polish compound.  Literally a five minute job on my '02 Mazda hatchback.  With that said, you only need a little bit.  I usually rinse the headlight, put few drops and polish at slow speeds side to side.  I only did it once and the headlight looks clear as a day. Granted, I can probably make it even more clear if I took the time and probably better to finish it off with plastic protector.  This would be great for motorcycle visors and anything plastic really.  For consistency, I recommend using a handheld polisher or drill attachment of some kind.  I definitely noticed a difference in more light on the ground after cleaning with this polish!	1
I have an Infinity G35 with the large plastic headlamp covers. Over the years they became hazy and cloudy, not terribly yellowed, but hazy enough to make them look old and faded. I bought a cheap no-name headlamp polishing kit from a store and used the sanding pad, polishing compound and buffer wheel as the direction showed. Actually looked even worse when done, didn't work at all. The dealer wanted $75 to do the headlamp covers and I was going to have them done but then I saw a commercial for Mcguires PlastX cleaner and thought what do I have to lose to try that first. I couldn't decide on the Mcguires polishing kit or just the compound and I decided to try just the $8.95 polishing compound to see if it made a difference.  I didn't have high hopes the PlastX would work since an entire kit (cheap store brand) with sanders and polishing wheels didn't work before. I knew the haze was on the outside of the lens because when I wet my finger and rubbed the lens it would clear up for a second but then haze over again quickly. I put some PlastX on a soft pad and began to rub the lens. Wow would be an understatement. I immediately saw yellow coming off onto the pad (didnt even look yellow on the lens, just looked hazy) and after just a minute or two of rubbing it in and wiping it off like car wax, the lens looked new again. Not just clean, it actually looked like a brand new $350 headlamp lens, and it didn't look like plastic anymore, it looked like glass.  I am truely amazed how effective and fast Mcguires PlastX made my headlamp lenses look like new again. And with no sanding disc, no buffing wheel, just the PlastX and a soft pad. They do recommend the polishing kit for badly hazed plastics but just the compound will work for mildly hazed ones. I wish I took before and after pics to share but I had little faith it would work, boy, was I wrong. Thanks Mcguires PlastX for saving me big $$$ and making my lenses look new again.	1
Brought PIAA bulbs for the car hoping to have brighter headlamps.  PIAAs were brighter, but the haze/fog on the old headlamps really dull the light.  Brought this hoping for a quick and cheap solution to fogging headlamp problem.  Applied per instructions and it just cleaned the lenses but did not remove most of the fog.  It is similar to the old turtle wax with a little bit of abrasives in the solution - cleans but not abrasive enough to take out the haze.  A waste of money.  I will try some chrome cleaner or silver polisher next.  If that doesn't work, will just order replacement headlamps from Amazon.com; which is about 2x the price of the more expensive haze/fog removers.  And those may not work either.	-1
After reading some of the negative reviews I think I understand what the problem is. If you purchased the product from Amazon you didn't have the benefit of reading the back label. The back label indicates which product to use for various oxidation levels.  Light: PlastX cleaner and polish Moderate: One step headlight restoration kit Severe: Heavy duty headlight restoration kit  The lenses on my 2007 Camry had a light haze forming. It was hazy enough to look bad but probably not enough to reduce night time light output. Most of the haze was from the top to the middle, probably because that's where the sun hits the most. After reading about different products I decided to try the least expensive and easiest method first. I purchased PlastX and in about 20 minutes both lenses were clear again. I simply applied the product and rubbed it into the lens, and repeated in areas that required it. This product will not eliminate scratches or pitting. It will only eliminate a light haze. If you have anything more than a light haze you'll probably need one of the wet sanding products and need to spend an hour or more on each lens to carefully remove the oxidation.	1
I love this thing. I only have to have one receiver for all my trailers (3). Change from one size to another with ease. The locking system is great too!	1
This thing is genius. I have two trailers with a 2" ball, and one older boat trailer with a 1 7/8" ball (why?). This is an elegant solution to the problem. There's no way to lock the balls on the post, so I keep the balls in my truck so they don't get stolen. When I need to tow, I'll just dig out the right size ball and toss it on, it only takes a second. I can do it without a screwdriver, it's not that tricky. I've had this on my truck for about a year and haven't had any problems taking the balls on or off, even after getting the hitch muddy. I'm not towing anything heavy, my heaviest trailer is maybe 1000lbs, but it tows just like any other ball.	1
Love the ability to interchange quickly!	1
nice fit	1
versatility abounds	1
Works as advertised	1
Works Great	1
It works pretty well for me and is easy to use.  It does need to be applied and then buffed off properly.  It is not expensive, so it is worth trying.  From what I have heard, headlights can also be fogged on the inside, and of course it would not help for that.  Consumer Reports says that the Sylvania and 3M restoration kits are the best, so I may try one of those.  The Meguiar's is cheaper, easy to use and definitely worth a try.  I use one lint-free cloth to apply it and a clean one to buff it.	1
I was initially skeptical about any product claiming to produce a cleaner, clearer headlight lens with almost no work.  I have tried other similar products and found them to be a waste of time and money.  But my wife has been complaining about her headlights for a year so I thought I would take a chance with Meguiars and found, to my surprise, that this product actually works.  Before I used Meguiars, her high beams would shine little more than her low beams.  After Meguiars, the high beams were bright, and her low beams were back to original specs.  All this on a 10year old car that had the original lens.  Great Product.	1
I have had dual ball mounts bouncing around in my trunk for years.  With a new car and hitch it was time for a change.  I haven't towed much with it yet but it definitely seems to fit the bill and seems solid.	1
Awesome...works very well!	1
This is a must have if you tow multiple trailers. I've had the complete kit version for years which includes 1 7/8", 2", and 2 5/16" balls. I just purchased a new trailer that required a taller ball mount, but I'm keeping my old one as well, so I purchased this smaller set so that I had the same setup on both mounts. Now I have a tall and short ball mount with interchangeable ball sizes, so I can town almost any trailer I need to.	1
I have the pin type on another vehicle and, although it works well, this is a much better design.  The ball rotates putting much less stress on the mechanism.  Put a little grease on the spindle to make it work even better.	1
First of all, if you are thinking of using this to restore your old, hazy, yellow headlights, then just forget it.  This product just does not have the abrasiveness to cut through the layers of oxidized plastic.  I tried this and even after a full hour of working the headlight and I wound up with a very shiny, glimmering, yellow headlight.  To correctly restore old, faded headlights, here are the steps you should follow: - Sand headlights with fine grit sandpaper (1000 grit or so) - Polish headlights with a compound.  Either a light rubbing compound or heavy polishing compound will work. - Polish headlights with a light polish to buff away any remaining scratches.  While theoretically possible to do this work by hand, it is very strongly advised to use an orbital polisher instead.  Your elbows will thank you.  This product here is designed for step #3 above.  If you have very light oxidation or marks on your headlights, this should take care of it.  However if the headlight is deeply discolored and heavily oxidized, other steps will be required for full restoration.	1
I have a 2006 Honda Civic Coupe LX. My car sits in my driveway here in Hawaii and the lenses got so bad that people asked me what was wrong with them. For an '06, it shouldn't be THAT cloudy. I'm a waxaholic. I'm sure the build up of wax, cleaners, combined with Hawaiian Sun oxidized the darn out of them. I tried a lens restorer I found on ebay for $5 and it worked somewhat, but not enough. I got Maguire's Plastx and I could not believe how well it worked. I uploaded pictures on here so you could see the difference.  It took multiple applications. I literally sat there with a stool and waxed on and waxed off for a good hour. After a lot of patience and elbow grease, the results were amazing. It even cleared up the damage my f&*(^ brother in law did. One day he thought he'd try and fix it himself with sandpaper. UGH! This product cleaned it up so good that unless you put your face right up to the lens, you can't really see the scratches.  If your lenses are extremely cloudy like mine were (or worse) expect to put in some time and effort. I did, and it was worth it. It saved me $100 to have a professional detailer do it.  P.S. I'm in the process of selling the car. Before I found Maguire's some guy tried to lowball me saying that the headlamps needed to be completely replaced which would cost over $500 in parts + labor costs = about $1000.  So, if he's right, I just saved myself $1000 on the value of my car. Thanks MAGUIRE!	1
These Camco RV Wheel Chocks are heavy grade injection molded plastic and work well to secure my 5'x10' enclosed trailer in place. These have ridges on the bottom and where it contacts the wheels, which adds extra gripping ability.  We picked up four of these Wheel Chocks locally for a little bit less than offered on Amazon.  Highly Recommended!  CFH	1
First, go buy these at Wall Mart for half the price as offered by Amazon.  I should have done so.  The chocks are lightweight, relatively sturdy, and provide effective holding.  They will break, however, if you pull or back the trailer over them.  The heavy rubber commercial versions are just too heavy and expensive for normal RV use.	1
Well made and works good. Be sure and get a pair of these to use on both sides of the wheel!	1
Bought this for fuzzy headlights on vehicles. I did three vehicles and can say it works well. I did use a large buffing wheel because I have one, I would recommend a small foam wheel even on a drill or whatever to make it easier. I think with some effort it would work by hand if the lights were not that bad. The pad on my wheel was a medium foam pad and I used it at low speeds. A smaller wheel would be nicer to get around the pegs on most lights and around curves and corners.  The first two vehicles the lights were discolored and slightly foggy but could still see the bulb inside. They were a little yellowed. I did them twice with the wheel and they came out great, clear and great shine. Spent maybe 2 minutes each application and no more than teaspoon of the polish, so it did not take long. The last vehicle the surface was bad, could not see the bulb inside and it felt rough. I went over those maybe 6 times, I think I should have wet sanded them with 2000 grit first or maybe compound but wanted to really test this stuff. They look pretty good now and clear, can still see they are not totally smooth on the surface if you look very close. There are still scratches in the plastic and texture where it was really bad. However it is all clear far as the light getting through the lens. For the price this can't be beat, there is enough to do a lot of headlights. Also hit some plastic emblems and it shined them up nicely, the type with writing inside the clear. Maybe not recommended but it also worked great on the chrome grill of a truck.  Update- The two vehicles are still looking good nearly a year later and no sign of yellowing or fogging. The really bad one has started to get worse again, the plastic is broken down. I plan to wetsand that one soon, but it is still better now than before treatment.	1
I considered purchasing the pricier plastic lens polishing systems, which are offered, but decided to try this stuff since it was much cheaper and was highly recommended by others.  I used it to polish the ten-year old headlight lenses on my van, which were very well scratched and oxidized so I could not see the lamps inside. But, after using this stuff with a regular shop rag, I was able to polish the lenses to where I could clearly see the lamps inside. Although, I was not able to get out the deeper scratches, It worked well enough for my purposes.	1
I used this product to polish the black plastic trim that is on the edge of the door on my car after it got scratched by a buffoon while getting my windows tinted. It worked reasonably well, but I can still see the microscratches. I ended up putting a coat of wax (Rejex) on the trim which gave it a bit more shine.  Overall, useful product.	1
Meguiar's PlastX Clear Plastic Cleaner and Polish does the trick of cleaning off oxidized and cloudy light lens after six or seven uses of this cleaner, it provides a light coating of polymer to protect your light after it has been cleaned of oxidation and cloudy film, Meguiar's PlastX plastic cleaner works wonders on light to moderately cloudy lens, I applied this to both my car lights one was moderately cloudy and the other light just had a light spot in one area of the lens that it removed in one application, the other light had more cloudiness, what I did was apply one light coat and rubbed with a little firm pressure with a back and forth motion alternating with circular motion as I was cleaning rubbed until I did not hardly see any of the cleaner then allowed it dry to a haze, then I just buffed off with a microfiber cloth, this left the light much clearer and newer looking, I then left it about two days before I started the whole process over again to my amazement the light was looking far more cleaner and clearer than it did the first application, then I skipped a day again then started the whole process over again, did this until I reached six or seven coatings, now my car light looks brand new, Meguiar's is the best so far and does what it says as all Meguiar's products do, if Meguiar's does not help your problem then you either have the cloudiness inside the light which then you would have to change the light altogether or your lights are really yellowed and damaged alot by the sun and the elements then this product will not help you but for light to medium cloudiness then this stuff is awesome and would recommend this to all who have a little or some cloudiness.	1
Easy and light to use, but sturdy enough to keep you vehicle from coasting.	1
Works like it should..Light to.	1
Perfect, as advertised and works excellent.	1
For the price and size it works very well. The ridges seem to anchor it effectively on dirt, I have not tried on pavement yet.	1
I just got this stuff after buying and using a full headlamp clean kit which DID NNOT work.  I guess I was hoping this would, and low and behold IT WORK'S great.  I have a 10 yr old BMW headlamps kinda had this glazing and chalky white cover in places, it would not shift.  First application of Meguirs PlastX cleaner and its cleaned and polished the headlamp.  I'm REALLY pleased and impressed, made my day! Fully recommended for headlamp cleaning.	1
love them	1
Good product at a good price.  I've used these for years and they do their job.  Their advantage is their light weight.	1
excelent	1
Great for our camper	1
fine	1
quality chock at very reasonable price.  Have one in each car.	1
Amazing Product that works great, removed the oxidation from the headlight lens,I also used the product on the rear tail lights as well gives both front and back lens a great new look.	1
This product claims to restore plastic but after 10 minutes of scrubbing one headlight cover with it and a terry cloth (as recommended), there was hardly any noticeable difference. I do some bodybuilding so strength of pressure application is not the problem! There are better products out there but I don't know if I'm allowed to mention a competitor's name lest someone think I work for them (I don't)--it's Novus' 3-step system!	-1

Awesome for the price and very durable.	1
Seems to work well, but I don't use it all that often.	1
Duh - They're plastic chocks...  Nothing special - they are relatively inexpensive and do the job.	1
These work great for my boat trailer.  Dang near began sailing down the driveway when I was working inside of it on the trailer. Decided I need to get wheel chocks... a 2x4 wasn't cutting it. As far as packaging is concerned, the frustration free packaging is just a ploy to get more money for packaging.  Just get them as an add on item with another purchase.  The packaging I got was in no way frustrating, just in a basic box.	1
Great price. Work great. Happy with the purchase. Holds my boat and trailer in place on my driveway. So far so good after one summer of use	1
These work fine on coarse or soft-ish surfaces, but tend to slip out on hard, slippery surfaces like painted concrete and garage floors.  They suit my needs, are cheap, and seem rugged.  I have a pair that is over 10 years old and another pair that I recently purchased to complement them.  I like how lightweight they are, but unlike some lightweight chocks these have never collapsed on me despite some abuse.	1
After a full season of use, I am surprised about how well they withstood the beating they got. We used two for our popup (about 1800lbs and 17 feet long) for storage and while on site camping. We accidentally forgot one was still in place when we tried to take away and we were prevented from moving forward. I was happy to know it stopped us and could take the extra force. No signs of cracking or wear and tear. If they do decide to break down, I will absolutely replace them with these again!	1
Compact - holds my trailer exactly as needed	1
good but small	1
I used this on the headlights of my 2006 model year car and it work wonderfully. I was noticing the beginning stages of oxidation, some very mild haze on the plastic. After washing and clay baring the car I taped off the area and used this product. It restored the clarity and shine. Realistically I wouldn't expect this stuff to make a ten year old and neglected car's headlights look brand new. In fact, I tried just that and it didn't work; even after sanding with 1,500 grit paper, using a rubbing compound, then this product. However, as a preventive maintenance or regular use item, I think it works superbly. It couldn't be easier to use, just follow the directions.	1
I tried it on my 2002 Lexus gs 300 and the results were not very good. I followed the exact directions that came with it. They improved but only for a few weeks-then they were cloudy again. Finally, i paid Lexus dealer $200.00 to do it with a product called BG. The result was very good, and 3 months out it continues to look very good. I do not reccomend Plastx, unless your headlights are mildly fogged. The BG is far better.	-1
good	1
Excellent price on these wheel chocks. Purchased (4) from Amazon for less $ than what I could drive to a nearby store and get! These have held up well for our first year of camping in our 1,800# pop-up camper. No structural or quality issues have arisen at all, and I trust these will last a good 5-10 years before having any sort of quality issues.  I will note: I have tried to use them to "chock" the tiny wheel that goes underneath the tongue of the camper... and there isn't enough "lip" at the tip of the angle to get under the wheel. You really need a very small wood block chock for the front wheel of the camper. However for the main tires along with 4 crank down jack stands it makes for a very solid camper once it is all set up.  If you are looking for wheel chocks- get these from Amazon you will not be disappointed!	1
Works like a charm	1
they will work for what I need them to do !	1
works	1
looks good	1
Lightweight, sturdy and cheap! What more could you really ask for? I keep these in my truck toolbox along with a set of aluminum racing style jack stands, for roadside repairs or locking a trailer in place wherever I happen to be.	1
Great item to have. Very durable. Have used for 2 seasons now. No cracks. Easy to place under wheels. Would defiantly buy again	1
Tough little blocks... My friend borrowed our horse trailer and she never removed the blocks before trying to drive away, these little chocks stopped her 1 ton truck cold, that is until she stepped on the gas and pulled the trailer over them, good thing there weren't horses on board. After wards I inspected the blocks and they look brand new with no visible damage.	1
I used this on my truck which had very yellow headligts from being in the sun for over 10 years. I used a cordless drill with attachment and this polish and my headlights are now crystal clear. Very impressed and it took less than 10 minutes. I tried using this on the plastic covering over my speedometer and gauges etc but the results were less than favorable. This is probably because that plastic was flimsy and hart to push hard enough to get the polish to do its thing so most likely not the fault of the polish. It was just hard to get into that small space and really buff it out..	1
All I have to say is wow! I used it on my wife's Honda today and IT WORKED! It's a simple application too.. no sanding, no extraneous buffing.. just squeeze it on an applicator and rub it in! It just plain works well! Not sure if any of you have oxidized lenses on your bikes or cars, but if you do, consider getting some of this! I'm impressed! (I taped off the painted surfaces, just FYI).	1
Cheap price and do the job well. Just make sure to give them a good hit to wedge them under the wheel. Also remember to chock both the front and back of EACH tire that you are chocking. When I put the front of the car up I use 4 of these chocks, two on each rear wheel.	1
Works great. A color different from yellow would be great.	1
good light weight chocks.  no issues, should have bought enough for both wheels on the trailer.	1
Low profile fits under lowered cars nicely.	1
I bought this stuff all skeptical and thinking it'd maybe give my headlights that wet, still scratched up look that some products give them. Well I'll be darned if it didn't shine them up like new! Never noticed there was writing on the headlamp before. With this stuff the Infiniti symbol shows right up. No more haze, no more embarrassment, and no more cloudy nights.  I used a bar of soap wrapped in a few layers of paper towel so I could really rub hard on the headlights to get them polished right. I don't have fancy tools like a buffer or whatever. It still worked 100%. One tip though, don't do it in direct sunlight. The heat from the sun will evaporate the moisture out of the polish and it won't work. I learned the hard way.  UPDATE: Well it's now 5/25/2013 and they're still looking great with daily driving.  UPDATE: It's 6/2015 now and although the Plastix was good, it was a lot of work and elbow grease. In 2014 I ordered this stuff http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00429NKWK?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage and it was night and day difference. So much easier and it has a bottle of UV protectant that is like magic in a bottle. Definitely using it from now on. It's been a year so far and the Sylvania stuff is still holding strong.	1
This product did not improve the clarity of the hazed headlamps on my 1997 Dodge Caravan. At least it did no harm.  P.S.  The product that did the trick was "CCP 5 Minute Headlamp Lens Restorer"	-1
This product is awesome worked great, left my headlights looking new!!!  Crisply clear. I hope they don't get oxidized again.	1
PlastX seems to work well on light to moderate yellowing, and not as well when the deterioration of the surface is more serious. It also seems to work all right on slight pitting and scratching.  It did make the moderately hazy 15-year old headlights on my own car look very clear again, and I can see the difference when I drive at night. If these had been the only lights I tried, I would have given PlastX 5 stars. But then I tried it on a headlight that was considerably more hazy, with a moderate pitting all over the surface, and some very hazy areas. On this light, PlastX didn't really make much of a difference.  I also tried it on a scratched CD, but it left fine scratch marks, so it's not as suitable as some of the products I've used that are especially made to polish CD's and DVD's.  All of the polishing I did was by hand, not with a powered buffer.  [Added after a couple of years] On the headlights where PlastX worked successfully, the haze came back after about a year, and PlastX cleared them again for about another year. I still give it 4 stars.	1
Awesome. Works as it should.	1
Love that they are lightweight when packing the RV but be assured you can run over them and break them!  (You'll only do that once!)	1
Smaller in width,  than the pair I bought at Northern Tool.	1
Can't believe these are this cheap! Great quality and have stood the test of travel for the last couple months!	1
Work great.	1
Does the job and lightweight!	1
Good value.	1
work great..	1
very light but work very well...beats carrying around one of the big heavy rubber ones	1
Works good holding my vehicles and boat in place. wouldn't trust it to hold a dump truck but didn't need it to do that!	1
I use these when I am working on my car. They're much lighter than carrying bricks around. I can carry them in my trunk in case of tire changing. They are fairly light duty so I wouldn't use them to stop a semi from rolling down a hill, but they are fine on my car.	1
Exactly What We were looking for,  had to buy 1 twice, as buying the 2 pack was more expensive (almost twice as much).  Senseless!!!	1
These work as expected.  I used the hole through the center to attach some paracord to ease removal.  When placed under my 1971. Starcraft camper wheels my camper stays put.	1
These are cheap, but effective.  I've used these many times when working on my car and they've worked well to keep my car from shifting.  I really like their lightweight, yet study, design.  The orange color is helpful at reminding me to remove them before driving my car away.	1
Good buy.  Not much to say about them.  Simple wheel chocks.  Lightweight, will work with the camper nicely.	1
Excellent product at an unbeatable price. I use these every oil change.	1
Good product	1
Great product!	1
Great seller and product	1
Good value for small vehicles. I use it for my solar powered trike. Strong but I would not try to rely on this with a heavy vehicle or serious hill. Using two could increase safety.	1
Works Great! Lightweight, Doesn't take much space.	1
as expected	1
light and does their job.  too many bugs get in on the openings though.  annoying spiders.	1
I like the security of blocking the car tires while I change the oil  or  tires.	1
Love that they are lightweight, but wish they had some sort of a gripping ability. A bit slippery on many surfaces.	1
This is a simple product that is constructed well and easy to use.  Cost is low.  I don't recommend forgetting the chocks are in place and pulling the trailer over them, as these lightweight units tend to squish a bit when run over, but they are a good tradeoff of cost and weight versus holding ability.  I haven't had any problem with them slipping on a variety of surfaces including blacktop, gravel, dirt, grass and cement.	1
they do what there suppose to do, very light.	1
Works, but seems to wear easy than expected.	1
Very good product	1
Good wheel chocks	1
Just what we needed for our RV	1
It's for my 24 foot boat trailer. The price was right.....if you buy them individually !?!? (Strange)	1
I bought four of these and use them on my trailer all the time. The only improvement I would make would be attach a piece ofnparacord to keep them together and pull out  more easily	1
Perfect way to keep my boat from rolling	1
Works as expected.	1
grate	1
product is as advertised	1
Cheap and it works	1
Good product.  Does what it is supposed to do.  Lightweight.  An essential part of your camping supplies.	1
These chocks are fast and easy.  They are a lot lighter than lugging wood blocks and the yellow color makes them easy to find in the crawl-through storage.  I have no complaints and would purchase again!	1
Great wheel chocks	1
Work great. Just as expected. Very light and portable.	1
Awesome	1
Exactly what it claims to do!	1
I used several different type for my pups until I ran across these and gave them a try.  They are resilient, easy to spot, and quickly became my go to wheel chocks.	1
Great chock.  Really strong, no-nonsense wheel chock.	1
Exactly as depicted	1
light and does the job	1
worked	1
Work as advertised, no issues	1
works great	1
Work great a good quality chock. Don't run over them like I did my first pair as it will damage them.	1
Works great....	1
Chocks are a little small but funtional.	1
I could not believe the great price on the single wheel chock!  I bought 12 & bolted two each together to make them easier to be seen on the garage floor for a car stop.  They were less than $4.00 each!  When shopping on Amazon, keep looking & in the midst of many items you will find what you are looking for @ the best price.	1
I used this for a while. Though hollow plastic I felt it was designed to hold a camper from rolling and it did. One day I forgot to remove it when pulling out and it seems to take very little pressure moving forward to flatten it like a pan cake so I though my 50,000 investment may be better served with a heavy duty galvanized wheel chock that won't give in and even let me move over it by mistake and let me know its holding solid if I ever did again roll forward over it.	-1
Well I am glad these guys don't sell shoes, because you would only get one shoe, which would work about as good as one wheel chock. Come on, I've never seen these being sold that we're in pairs, thus my disappointment in receiving only one...I guess I can put it under my one wheel trailer......	-1
Brand new wheel chocks. Popped out (like three feet away) from behind rear wheel while I was backing under the fifth wheel camper allowing camper to slide backwards (slight downward slope). Bought heavy-duty rubber chock to replace this set as I never want to experience that again.	-1
Much too flimsy. On first time out I accidentally ran over one. It flattened out. Better to pay a little more and buy the heavy duty Chock. If you don't drive over it, I suppose it would be okay.	-1
Only fair.  NOT very durable and do NOT fully secure the trailer.  Spend the extra $$$ and get the X-Block and / or the Fastaway (we now use both, Fastway for intiial set and the x block for final lock in)	-1
I don't deny this is a well-made product at an affordable price, and it may likely work for your purposes, but the angle of the chock is designed for a really big tire given the size of the chock.  They look downright silly on my Coleman pop-up with 13" tires.  Only about the first rung and a half of the chock actually touches the tire, so the rest is left sticking out in nowhere.  I'm left thinking a simple block cut from a 2x4 will work just as well for me. Maybe an improvement to the existing design would be to make the back half gently curved down as well, rather than a straight shot. Then users would have two options, one which could fit smaller tires better.  As is, they really are over-kill on small popup campers.  Sticking with a simple block of wood works too.  I'll be returning my chocks.	-1
I have used 5200 for years. This has always been my favorite sealant, be it on my boats , around the house, or general repairs. This last tube I bought however, did not make me very happy. Over three days to dry/cure. this was indoors.  I am assuming this is a very rare exception as this has never happened to me before. Like I said , I have used this 3M product for years and have always recommended this as a ,  pretty much ,  permanent flexible weld. Well worth every penny .  I will assume it was produced on either a Friday or Monday.	-1
GREAT FRIGGIN GLUE to use on ANYTHING... however... get the 24 hour FAST CURE 5200 kind at your local orange apron hardware store. You know... the Depot for your Home. Same packaging but its red where the blue is on this week long cure variant. Bonding is the same. Dries very solid but remains flexible. I'm using it to restore a 12 foot aluminum boat. Side note... I fixed my boots that have Vibram soles with the 24 hr 5200 and I can NOT believe how well it worked. A few weeks later the sole tore more but the glue did not. Best hard core glue out there in my opinion,  just wish they made it in black.	-1
Did not like it  the spout would not screw on tight and when squeezed the adhesive went everywhere and all over me.  It has been a week and the sealiant  is still very sticky and did not cure.	-1
Too small for a whole car. And I don't know how to store it. If you keep it dry, it will become hard and easy to break. If you keep it wet it will not do the work.	-1
Beware. The instructions say you must use within 24 hours of opening. Not a good thing if you don't use the whole tube.	-1
Noisy	-1
Either I am using it wrong or the product doesn't dry the cars as others described. I bought this based on other reviews, I used it once and my car ended up with alot of swirls. I will try again another time and see if I can get better results.	-1
Way over priced, bad balance likely a good design but made in china like so many crappy products on Amazon,	-1
I attempted to use this to repair a transducer mounting screw hole in fiberglass boat transom. The 5200 sealant is very thin it would not stay in the holes and just ran out of the small screw  hole in the transom. It will not work on a vertical surface. It is too thin and  will just run out. A complete waste of my time and money. I have to clean up the mess now and start over.	-1
The fan has too much vibration.  It should have been better made.  I had to return it as it walked on the floor.	-1
leaves streaked on glass. ok on paint but you will find re-doing your car windows :(	-1
Just opened the box. Really nice selection of built in mounting methods. Decent amount of breeze generated, BUT the blades are out of balance.  While sitting on a table in the van the first speed is fine, but above that it definitely isn't going to cut it with my wife, guaranteed! It turns the entire van into a magic fingers vibrating bed.   For what I paid I expected more(or less vibration). Really a pity cause the rest of it is very nice. I'm returning it. UPDATE: 7/22/17 I emailed the company and they assured me the problem had been corrected so I ordered another one. Arg! Same as the first one. I've already got it boxed for return and won't be ordering another. Probably be okay in a kennel, but not in my camper. Downgrade from 3 stars for the hassle.	-1
Only used it 1 time,  we need to try it on a few more projects in  order to give a full review.	-1
Came broken. No protection inside the box. I would expect more for a $70 fan.	-1

Item has dirty finger prints on the top casing & tape on the feet. The fan blades hit the fan casing while running, Where is the quality control and pride in MADE IN AMERICA. This is a continuing quality issue based on other feed back on this site.	-1
Takes FOREVER to cure, it's been on for about a week now and is still tacky. It may be resistant to gasoline when it's dried but I think that will be in the spring when it warms up.	-1
arrived damaged, I returned the tube	-1
I took off two stars because of the build quality. My fan came missing 4 screws on the casing and I will have to call customer service and have them send me screws.. Quality control with all "fan-tastic" products is REALLY bad. For a fan that has MADE IN AMERICA on all sides of the box I am shocked with the condition both my RV roof fan and this endless breeze fan came to me in.  All that being said I chose to keep this overpriced fan because I like the 12V motor and fan blades. It is relatively quiet on both low and medium speeds and blows a decent amount of air. It's 2016 and you still don't have many choices with this type of fan so this will have to do =\	-1
I found the first stage oxidation remover be a little aggressive so I decided to stop	-1
I didn't like this. It doesn't dry very well and it left streaks. Not as advertise and the price is too high for just a wet rag	-1
The fan worked well  but killed my car battery in 8 hrs of use. It claims to draw very little amps	-1
Did not work as well as expected. I ended up going back to the Meguiars cleaner and polish wax which was cheaper and worked better removing the haze from the front cap of my RV .	-1
You have to put it together with 3 screws onto the hitch insert.  Then it wouldn't fit under the bumper on my F250.  The top of the flag hits the bumper.  Waste of money.	-1
We have a Fan-Tastic fan in our RV bathroom and this is either another company or simply JUNK.  Yes, it blows air but even on the very lowest setting but it is LOUD.  To compare, we have an inexpensive ($15?) Honeywell Turbo fan that is 1/2 the noise on its highest setting!  May keep it for a dire emergency but I think we are going to look for another option (maybe a converter so our batteries can run the Honeywell fan if we do not have shore power).  This is tops a $15 fan and miserable to be around.	-1
Very hard to work with.  Did not give the results I was hoping for.	-1
I tested this out on my transom before doing the hull and I'm glad I did....unfortunately it still took a long time that'll I never get back. I thought with some hard work it would do the job and it didn't look good at all afterwards. You need to use a lot of this product for it to do the job and it will get expensive without the final result desired. I will keep the kit to bring some shine to my hull stripes....hopefully it's enough to do that job. Needs much to be desired...unimpressed again by Meguires. Note: my boat is not heavily oxidized and this should have handled the job.	-1
dented casing on all the tubes	-1
Does great at drying, but I follow every direction on the bottle and it smells like mildew every time I go to use it, no matter how many times I hand wash it. I've used similar products in the past & it did not stink.	-1
vibrates a bit much for the price, but in all, good fan. I sent this fan back to amazon 3 times because they all were not packed well.  They all vibrated.  I also noticed the sticker on the front of all of them was not even close to being center.  Seems like a little thing to complain about, but working in consumer electronic is they don't care about getting there stick right, then I can only image what they care about the rest of the product.  Seems another deal were a family starts a business with good morals, then they get bought by a large company and quality suffers because now they nickel and dime every penny.  One final thing,  Amazon needs to learn how to pack its shipments however.  yes this is opinionated, but to often I'm finding issues with products these days  After owning for 6 months, i can say this fan is way over priced.  I have 2 of them.  the legs are falling off, it vibrates and falls off wherever you place it.  how these are getting 4.5 stars is beyond me.  I wish they would not put made in america on it, it give OUR products a bad image.	-1
I was really looking forward to getting this fan based on the reviews I read.  I am going on vacation in 2 days and want to take this along for some tent camping on the way to and back from Disney World in Florida.  I anticipated the feet not being to great since it was mentioned in the review but found two other problems right out of the box.  The 12 volt DC plug in has a problem with the spring on the tip, it just loosely moves in and drops out when you face it down.  I have seen this sort of thing before and should be able to fix it.  The other is the fan switch.  It has a springy feel to it and doesn't correspond to the numbers on the dial.  When you flip it to the next speed, it springs back a bit.  It doesn't effect the speed and all the speeds seem to work fine.  I think I just expected the workmanship to be better, certainly not befitting a sixty five dollar item.  Will update review when I get back from Disney on the 19th of June.	-1
These aren't the best way to dry your car as far as taking care of your finish. It soaks up water well but I use it for door jambs etc now, not for paint.	-1
I'm getting read to box and send this sucker back.... I've had good luck in the past with this company on a previous fan ten years ago. They must be making them off shore. I hope The Donald can get these made again back here in the USA.  When you first plug it in its okay.... But, after about a half hour of running this fan gives out the most god awful high pitched screeching sound. This fan could surely be used to get information from rag heads in their cells. It would be better than water boarding. After listening to this fan for an hour they would sing like canaries...	-1
Alright, I have a 10 month old travel trailer with a dark brown front that was starting to get "white" from the sun.  I ordered this stuff hoping to restore it to it's glory.  I used a Griot's Garage orbital powered polish/wax applicator which is better than any job you could do by hand.  I saw very little improvement and it did about the same job as a bottle of $12 marine/RV restorer I got from Wal-Mart.  This does an alright job but not worth the time/money since you have to do 3 applications.	-1
I used this on the outside of my HitchHiker 5th wheel RV and it had to be all removed after 6 months.  It collects dirt and is impossible to clean after a trip.  It may be good for boats but it is no good at all on your RV.  It does not have a gloss like other RV caulks.  Would not recommend.	-1
Seems like it was working good when I bought it, but now I don't like it.  I have had it for almost a year. Does not dry my cars very well, leaves them wet.  I have never found a good substitute to the real chamois.  See the before and after pictures, and that's because my vehicle was not even that wet.  I don't know of it's because of the humid climate I live in, but I never had a problem with the real chamois.  I agree with another reviewer that's it's more like a sponge.	-1
I only purchase this as a back up. It is built ok and the price was good. I also taped it up to make it stronger and the wires aren't exposed.	-1
use any wax will do better	-1
When I first got fan it made a very irritating whine and I was not happy.  I do not run invertors due to the same sound.  Googled a camping website and a person said their fan whined and the person called Fantastic and was told to run the fan with reversed polsrity for a while.  I ran my fan reversed polarity for 10 min or so and when I hooked it up properly the whine was gone!,  I am very happy now!  I am guessing the bearings are sealed and motor pre lubed and running it backwards helps to spread the lubrication uniformally.  I have been listening to noisy 12v fans for a long time and my Endless Breeze fan is exactly what I dreamed of.  Now I have to see if it bothers my 12vLed tv when I go to my camper.  Update..  The fan does not bother my 12 v led tv.  The fan motor seems to be getting quieter with more usage.  I am running it off deep cycle batteries and solar panels now...when I first tried it l, it was powered by a battery charger which probably made the motor whine more than normal.  Update..the whine did not go away and was driving me nuts!!! Who could not notice the whine noise from the Atwood motor??? I ended up taking off the grill on the side that is near the back of the motor so plastic would not amplify the noise. Now it is bearable.  They should have used a better motor or had better noise reduction.. At this pricd and their nsme on the line there is no excuse for the unmistakeable high pitched torturing whine!!!!!! I have a wood stove in my work / storage trailer and having the fan to quickly circulate the air when it gets to warm is just as nice as using	-1
Moved a LOT of air but just too noisy for a small camper. Had to return it. Also, as others mentioned, the swing out feet are very fragile and loose. Manufacturer should redesign the feet so people who don't mind the noise might consider keeping it for the excellent air flow it creates.	-1
I have an older absorber that I was looking to replace.  The new one doesn't seem to soak up water like the old on did when it was new.	-1
scratches car	-1
It was okay quality wise but nothing special amd for the price i think a bit pricey than other amzon basics items	-1
Different from original from 10 years ago, this one is made by attwood, flat motor from 10 years ago was made in taiwan,this it is a lot noisier with a disticnt whine , not a good sleeping fan, also does not have a really true slow speed . Just fast,faster.fastest, mine came with the knob all loosy goosy and required a socket to tighten jam nut, missing rubber foot pad, fan blade is clear ,original was white , also the 12v plug cracked after a couple of pulls from the socket	-1
The bolts that come with this are a bit too short to go through the pump and the mounting frame, so I wound up using the previous bolts. Also, the kit doesn't include any nuts, just the bolts, not sure why that is. I probably will look for a non-Sierra brand next time.	-1
"Endless Noise"  is the better description.  For the outrageous price, I had hoped for at least some air flow.  It looked like the best out there but am disappointed at this point.  Yet to use it in a camping situation yet.  Will try it then, just hoping its worth it.  Then again, I was warned.	-1
I have owned many Fan-Tastic Fans in my RV's and generally they are an excellent product, if pricey. It was with this expectation that I bought this fan. Well, I guess everything a company makes can't be a home run. This fan is a full 6 dB over my $21.99 Wal-Mart fan and an irritating noise to boot. When you charge $80.00 bucks, only $40.00 less than you can buy an window a/c from home depot, you expect an outstanding product. This is not an outstanding product. Yes, it's 12V, which I guess adds a dollar of two to the cost of a fan motor, but come on, this is not good for your reputation. $29.99 maybe....It's coming back for sure...	-1
I got this fan for my travel trailer since it would run off a 12 volt socket. 1st issue was it was all I could do to get the thing plugged in. Either my socket was undersized or the plug on the fan was oversized, it was all I could do to get the thing pushed in far enough without breaking something. When I finally got it in far enough to power the fan, imagine my surprise when the fan blade rubbed on the fan housing as it was spinning , which caused a lot of noise. I promptly returned the fan.  I gave a second star for the ease of returning an Amazon product...otherwise it would have been just one.	-1
It took just shy of $76 to get this to my door.  First one was dead on arrival and was returned.  Thanks Amazon for making this painless as usual.  I got the second from a local RV store and also ended up returning it.  Here is my assessment:  Pros: 1. There are little brackets to mount it on a cage. 2. Switch is satisfyingly chunky and feels good to operate. 3. They used a decent quality cord and 12v plug, although it could have been longer.  Cons: 1. The feet are very fragile.  One was at a strange angle relative to the other which made the whole fan wobble around. 2. If you move the fan while in operation, centrifugal force distorts the fan and causes it to hit the case. 3. Motor makes a fair bit of noise. 4. Doesnt move a huge amount of air. 5. They go to the trouble of quoting current consumed on the various settings but the figures on the fan I measured were about 45% higher, when measured at 12.7v, more so at 13.8V.  They must have made their measurements somewhere in the 11v range.  I found this a little under hand. 6. It seems very heavy for what it is but has still feels poorly built.  This is quite an impressive achievement.  In summary: if this were a $25 fan (ignoring the first dead on arrival), it would get 5 stars.  But because of the price and the things above it barely scores 1 point.  They make much hype about Made in America.  I often complain about crap from China but at least the Chinese stuff is cheap.  My search for a decent 12v fan continues.	-1
I've ordered this very item probably 10 times in the last 2 years and always gotten a Wesbar brand wiring harness in retail packaging.  This time I got what appears to be a cheap made in Taiwan knockoff.  Instead of the wire insulation being the same color all the way through, the plastic on all the wires is brown (lighter in color than the genuine Wesbar) and the green and yellow is paint over the brown plastic.  First picture shows original Wesbar on the left, the knockoff on the right.  Second picture is the same as the first, with better lighting to show that the insulation on the knockoff is painted.  Third picture shows the packaging the item comes in.  Don't know what happened...bring the real deal back and I'll boost this rating!	-1
Rag can't go through car it stays.....	-1
I do not understand this thing at all. After soaking it in warm water and using it, it moves water around, but doesn't absorb it and certainly doesn't leave my car dry, it is also hard to move it along the surface of the car.	-1
I don't like this for drying cars.  It seemed to smear the water rather than absorb it.  It always left streaks on my newly washed car.  After "drying" with this, I'd have to go back and get rid of the water spots.  I now use Meguiar's X2000 Water Magnet Microfiber Drying Towel.  Sucks up the water for a streak-free shine.  The Water Magnet can even get rid of DRIED on water spots.  It's crazy.  I'll be using that from now	-1
Generally I never give a one or two stars to items on Amazon, but in this case, one or two stars is a gift.  Yes, the item will absorb as advertised, but compared to other chammies, I am not so sure. The reason for a one star is that one cant wipe or clean up with this item; it will not go over any surface with out hanging up, twisting, etc.  I bought two of them and will return the other.  Don't waste your money.	-1
Mildew even though it is "mildew resistant"	-1
Balls corroded and froze up on the mount.  They became no longer interchangeable after only a few months.  Better off getting the 3-ball that you turn to chose the ball size.  Very disappointed.	-1
Wet towel as directed it did not absorb all the water off the car and was almost like it was scraping against finish .	-1
Did not fit motor water pump as described. Returned to vendor.	-1
This is not the German stuff. It absorbs water well...once. Once it tries it becomes as stiff as cardboard and its useless.	-1
Are you serious?  It turns stiff as cardboard when it dries.  I purchased this to dry my camera gear when it was raining and took it out of the container so I could store it in my backpack.  Low and behold, it dried up like cardboard.  Then I found out you have to keep it in that thing, and it was coated with some alcohol like chemical, which I am sure is not good for my gear.  Crappy product..give me a regular microfiber towel please.	-1
I've been looking for something that replaces a natural chamois for awhile, I like the idea of a washable chamois, but this left a thin sheen of water behind which left the glass streaky.  It also went moldy when left damp.  Dried out it seems fine for other jobs, but not what I had hoped.	-1
It doesnt do anything just hard to move around on the car, doesnt absorb any water. just useless. will not buy another.	-1
I purchased this item to dry my car. I own a black car and don't recommend this product. Instead use a soft microfiber waffle towel. This product leaves streaks and swirl marks on the paint finish its to rough.	-1
I had the original ABSORBER (several in fact over the years). My most recent finally wore out. The orignal versions performed very well. BUT the "NEW" version....NOT!!!! I am amazed at the good reviews received on the very poor "new" Absorber being sold now. It performs no were near as good as the original. What a big step down in quality. Hard, Barely absorbant, Discolors easy, Tears easy...... look elsewhere......I am not sure where???, but someone has to make a decent synthetic drying cloth (by the way, a real chamois is very hard to care for and thus my search for a good synthetic)... sorry for being wordy.	-1
Lighter duty than hoped.	-1
I'm quite an avid automotive detailer, and strive to keep my Corvette Z06 in showroom condition which is difficult with how many miles I put on it. So regular washes are necessary to keep the grime off. I had previously been using a microfiber type drying towel, which was lent to a friend who never returned it. So before washing my car one day I ran over to Autozone and purchased on of these 'Absorbers'. While it is good at removing the large buildups of water on a vehicles surfaces, it is not good for final streak free drying. No matter how hard you wring this Absorber out, it still leaves water streaks. I had to run out to find a suitable drying towel and re-wash my car to remove the dozens of water spots the absorber left. Since using it, I have purchased a "Carrand 40059AS Microfiber MAX Supreme Deep Pile Fiber Drying Towel" through Amazon, and my goodness what a difference. So now I use the absorber for removing the bulk of water from my Z06, then finish up with the Carrand Drying Towel.	-1
Could not get these to work for me, the buckles won't stay locked closed which makes them essentially worthless.	-1
I have used this three times. It dries my car well. After each use I have stored it damp and rolled up in the tube, as per the manufacturer's directions. Last Saturday I got it out of the tube and it has little pink spots all over it. I think it is some kind of mold. I used it anyway and it still dries well, but I don't like handleing mold or rubbing mold on my car. I think I will go back to towels.	-1
care on purchasing  -there are 2 measurements in the listing -the one in the general and the one in the product specificications  (which is the wrong measurements.	-1
I trailer in saltwater and freshwater and don't disconnect (the lights are handy at night), so these really don't work for me.  Both times the main bulb failed with a green spot over the lens.  Submersible is a curious term for something that fails when wet.  I've replaced two driver side but still have the original passenger side that I bought last fall.	-1
I used this on my car the other day for the first time with excitement.  I ended the clean with less enthusasism:(  I bought two with the hopes of using one in the house and one on the car.  Will try two for the car on wash number two.  Maybe that will make the job easier.  Also takes a few swipes to pick up the water.  Need at least a second try.  I detailed the clean with a nice towel "Meguiar's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber - Pack of 3" I bought two of these and should have just bought four sets in hindsight.  They work as advertised and am impressed with the results. Easy to use and no streaks.  These special type of absorbents all give me difficulty and have yet to find the trick or the magic chamois or absorber.  This was definately not it!	-1
I purchased this in April 2015 but just returned home to find this strainer I ordered. It says "In-Line Strainer" the order says "In-Line Strainer;however, this is an "Inlet Style" strainer and it even shows the two styles on the back of the package. This style is made to plug directly into a QUAD pump not inline with the supply hose. And of course it's too late to return it.	-1
Well I thought it is marine grade. Apparently it is not. Should be ok for fresh water.	-1
Worst thing I've ever bought.  I purchased the 1st one in January.  They replaced it in February, because the "C" clip that grabs the shaft would not open to allow the lock to slip onto the its shaft.  I worked OK the next couple of times. Then, it got to where you had to really work the lock to get the C clip to let go of the shaft, so that you could remove the lock. This went on for 3-4 times.  Then, yesterday, I was going fishing and I could not get the key into the keyway no matter what I tried.  After about 15 minutes, I had to get a bolt cutter and cut the lock, which I might add, was quite easy to do.  I bought a new boat in January and I've taken the lock off/on maybe 12 times.	-1
Folks need to understand that this is not a security device. It may keep a child from unhooking your coupler, but that is about it. That is not why I marked it down. I marked it down because the advertisement reads "This is made of solid brass." NO, IT IS NOT. Brass does not rust and this device does. This is the second item, in this order alone, that included false statements in its description. From now on, if the description does not say "made in USA" I am buying from a different web site.	-1
DO NOT BUY!  Inferior mounting bolts.  Both bolts sheared off inside my block.  This may require removing the engine to extract the defective bolts.  They are NOT marine grade.  Do not buy this item.  I will be contacting Amazon and seller to file a damage claim.	-1
UPDATE 6/28/16 Originally I had given this 4 stars but after having this since October 21, 2015 it has gone from hard to use to impossible to use. I have tried several lubricant sprays and greases but nothing works for long, this does not work well for a boat trailer where the coupler gets wet frequently as it just starts to corrode and get hard to use, my original coupler lock was still going working great when I maimed it and this one is now dead and I am looking for a replacement.  I had expected it to last at least a couple of years of use and it hasn't lived up to that expectation.  ORIGINAL 4* REVIEW: I recently had to replace my coupler lock that i had been using for the last several years&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Trimax-SXTC3-Premium-Stainless-Steel-Coupler-Lock-3-5-34-Span/dp/B000W0MOLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Trimax SXTC3 Premium Stainless Steel Coupler Lock (3.5" Span)</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Trimax-SXTC3-Premium-Stainless-Steel-Coupler-Lock-3-5-34-Span/dp/B000W0MOLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Trimax SXTC3 Premium Stainless Steel Coupler Lock (3.5" Span)</a>&nbsp;which after using both I prefer the Trimax. For this review I will compare and contrast the two on the major features:  Fit: About even, they both are the right length and diameter for wide couplers. Security: About even, they both have very small pins and large heads for good leverage and they wouldn't slow down a dedicated thief much at all. Finish: Advantage Trimax, it is less intrusive visually and has a nice brushed finish and even the pin feels like it slides better when you put it in. Key: Advantage Master Lock, a normal flat key fits much better in my pocket than the round barrel key of the Trimax and you can have extras made. Rubber Cap: Advantage Trimax, they both work but the Trimax is easier and feels better and this is after 3 years of use. Installation: Advantage Trimax, the Master Lock is a 2 hands and a knee operation where I could close the Trimax with either a hand and knee or just 2 hands.  Over all, let your budget be the guide.  When I bent my Trimax (I have a habit of leaving them on the bumper when decoupling and driving away)  the cost difference was enough to make me try the Master Lock which works fine, I just prefer the Trimax.	-1
good item	-1
item is to lite for my needs	-1
I agree, it is flimsy as  hell. Ratchet works, holds in place but I have a feeling the first can of gas to slide into this is going to break it in half.  Should have made this at least 4ft wide and then ratchet out from there.	-1
In theory should work great yet just the opposite.  Not heavy or strong enough to hold mouldings down in the bed of my truck.	-1
Its started out great. Barely use it, but within a couple of months it was becoming obvious that the ratcheting system was giving out, binding, and over all gave out. Maybe the weather got the best of it, I could sat there and lubed it every two weeks, but I need something to just sit there in the work truck without major maintenance or I got bad one.	-1
This product does not tighten up against the bed sides easily. Save your money and get the Hitchmate  cargo bar, it's much easier to use.	-1
At any point in time I have 4-6 of these in rotation. I use them in my business to secure items to one wall or another in my work van daily. Soooo why only 2 stars? Well... The ratchet itself holds up, it's the bar with notches that ends up giving up the ghost. The holes wear out from daily use or the small piece of metal between each hole bends ever so slightly and the trouble starts. It will begin to be VERY hard to unlock. Once they wear a bit more it will start skipping gears. Why do I keep buying them? I'm stuck... This allows for minor adjustments in pressure unlike others I've tried. I'll keep buying them but only because I haven't found better.	-1
This product doesn't fit my superduty truck bed.  If I want to place it anywhere that requires both ends to extend fully (e.g., nearly anywhere within the confines of the bed), the release mechanism no longer works and I literally have to get tools to force it to release.  If it had been made just 3" longer, I wouldn't be giving this terrible review.  Anyway, don't waste your money on this lame product!	-1
The ratchet is in the middle of the bar so you have to climb inside the bed of the truck to reach it. I have some cheaper versions, which are not as strong but the ratchet is on the end so you can easily reach it, over the side of the bed and lock it in from the outside.  Other than that these are well made and ratchets tight and secure just a hassle to secure due to having to get into the bed	-1
The bar becomes very floppy once you get it extended out enough to span a pickup bed. Also you have to choose between tightening it up so much it flexes the bed or just a little less where it's on the floor when you arrive. There are better choices out there and I found on at a Uhaul of all places. I wish I had taken a pic of the brand. It was far better designed.	-1
I have had this cargo holder for over a year now.  When I first started using it, I kept it in the cab when not in use, it worked great and was easy to ratchet.  However, (and I'm glad I didn't review this earlier) I got a new truck and there was no room in the cab, so I left it installed in the bed.  Well, needless to say, I can no longer get it to ratchet without great effort.  I'm a small woman and it's absolutely no use to me anymore unless I've got a muscle man available to open and shut it for me.  Yes, I've tried lubricating it, but no go.  Oh, and the cargo separator bar (by another company) WILL NOT work with this model.  So, today, I'm ordering the more expensive type and hope it works.  Good luck if you decide to save the $7 and order this one.	-1
The "feet" on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless. When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck.	-1
This looks like a high quality cargo bar, but on the 2nd use, the ratcheting function broke. It's useless now.	-1
will not get tight enough to hold, I ratchet down as far as i can and it still will not hole very good.	-1
I received the cargo bar and installed on my truck. I was disappointed in the bar diameter and overall durability. I would recommend you keep looking for a sturdier cargo bar. I prefer those used on semi's as they can handle more weight.	-1
This is the most worthless item I believe I have ever purchased from Amazon, or anywhere else in many years. I would have returned it, but it took me a month  before trying it out. You lock it in place and hit a bump with the truck and it slips back two or three teeth and drops to the bottom of the truck bed. Didn't look, but probably made in China or some other third world country to specs designed by someone with a GED.	-1
This does not stay and comes off when you're driving. It would help if you use a different mount. But why would you do that to double or triple the original cost?	-1
Fell off the window after a few minutes. Bad suction.	-1
suction cup does not hold as well as needed	-1
Suction does not stay on - in summer it falls off the windshield. The angle is kind of awkward so I had to have it upside down and when I tried to adjusted the tiny link between mirror and suction snapped.	-1
Tried mounting it on the windshield, fiberglass dash, and plexiglas instrument sun shade. This thing is not sticking to anything... Very unhappy with the purchase.	-1
This mirror was okay but is already broken because the suction cup doesn't hold very well !!!  It only lasted for about a month and was hard to adjust.	-1
Its a very nice mirror and worked great for the first year. No loss of suction, never fell off. However, starting in year two, it would never keep suction. I tried cleaning the window and the suction cup; huffing a little moisture onto it prior to sticking, not huffing on it, nothing worked and so I went without a mirror. Plus you cant really make it go above your windshield, so it blocks some of the forward view. It was a quality mirror for the price, but now its in the give-away box. Will be buying a clamp-on that I can position above my windshield. So I do not recommend this product.	-1
I bought this to use in my car as a big mirror to see my child, but it won't stick to the window long.  The suction design is not strong enough for the weight of this mirror, and it is heavy.	-1
I was thrilled with M17, but now I am just angry - I don't know if the problem was the M18 or M17- I used it to take the oxidation off my convertible's window- It did a great job- I removed as much as I could with a soft rag- but then something weird happened- when it rained, some of the residue was washed off the window onto the fabric around it- wherever it touched I have white staining and white dots- they seem impossible to remove. I am going back to the glowing review I wrote for the M17 and change it.	-1
I've had "hitch haulers" in the past that were solid steel and very heavy. I tried this because it is aluminum and much lighter. It is too flimsy and only for very very light use. I can't return it because I already assembled it and tried it. Wasted time and money.	-1
See update below. I've been putting polyurethane on this what I believe is eucalyptus wood. I'm fed up with it not lasting so I gave oil a try. I sanded my table down and put this on. Pictures attached are bare wood on right and oiled one left and other picture is fully complete with only 2 light coats. Will add another coat the following day. Thus far it's looking great and "wood" recommended.  *****Update****** 5 days after, wood seemed very bare and was definitely not getting any protection. I went another route and bought http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AYAAO?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00 Starbrite Tropical Teak Oil Natural Light which sealed and oiled up the wood real good. i have a review of that as well.	-1
The only thing Marine about this product is that one would have to use it almost weekly !! Useless for durability.	-1
This not "teak" oil. It's a thinned down linseed oil. I should have returned it but didn't and now I wish I had stuck with the Watco oil instead. You'd expect better from a name like Meguiars.	-1

A year later & a 1-2 foot wake so now its 2 stars.  Bent and released 1 mooring (I was using only 1 of these for the back) for my jet ski in what was a pretty good wake.  The plastic gave at the thinnest point that you can see in the bottom left of the picture.  So these are maybe still good for a quick dock connection if you moor/attach at two points and stick around but I wouldn't trust them for a great deal more.  Original Review I've used these for a couple of weeks so I don't know about durability (hence 4 star) but they look like they should hold up well (1 year later & no they don't). I've found them to be a quick and solid connection for my rear mooring line to the jet ski at the dock. I put it in upside down so I can more easily reach the tab that locks it in place.  Prior to having these I had to feed a rope through the holes in the rear deck of my Waverunner which took longer.	-1
this piece of CRAP lasted 1 year...cost me  twice what a Walmart battery costs and didn't last any longer. I would give it zero stars if they had that option...I see a lot of good reviews here but I hate it and will never buy another one...I will be telling everyone at my lake  that the odyssey batteries are junk and not worth the money  I posted this back in June....now it is September...I just came back to see if they actually printed my review...AND THEY DID!!  My position has not changed, these batteries are NOT worth the $114.00 I paid.. I will buy wal-mart batteries each year for around $50.bucks and have a better deal.. As far as I'm concerned this Odyssey battery is a total RIP OFF...  (Signed, feeling like a sucker for falling for the hype.)	-1
bought 2 of these for Seadoo's  supposed to be dry batteries that can be stored and then used.  Bought them and didn't use for 6 months.  then went to use them would not charge.  contacted odyssey 300 dollars worth of trash and no support.  Don't waster your money like i did	-1
Good news - this makes changing your oil more convenient assuming your oil filter is accessible from the top. I'm not sure it saves time - see below.  Bad news - you're not going to see anything else that may be going wrong elsewhere under the car if you don't ever get under the car. That may not be a bad thing depending on your whole program - but that's how it is.  This thing works as long as the oil is relatively hot when you pull it out. It is mess-free on extraction. It gets a little dicey when you transfer to a waste container. The thing comes with a spout to connect when transferring to the waste container. For me, emptying the tank with that spout connected was not mess-free. I ended up using my funnel without the spout. The spout has a small diameter, and there does not appear to be an air release, unless I missed it somewhere. The result is a slow glug... glug... glug... and resulting spurting stream of nasty black oil, all while you're bent over, trying to keep from spilling everything all over. Once I took off the spout, it poured quickly and neatly into my funnel. The good news is that transfer operation can happen away from the car, on a piece of scrap cardboard, so spills are not so terrible.  All in all this is not a bad purchase. The hose that fits down the dipstick tube is very nice quality, the remaining components are good enough for their intended use. Nothing exotic or overly high quality, just good enough.  Bottom line is you don't have to jack up the car, pull off the belly pan, burn your hand, scrape your knuckles, or strip out the oil pan or its plug. I'm not convinced it saves time because the oil flow rate is slow. It does indeed make the oil change more convenient, especially assuming your car has a filter accessible from under the hood. Plus it's cleaner, almost no chance you leave oil on the driveway with this tool.  Delivery was almost instant with Prime, no packaging or missing parts issues.  UPDATE: Second use, I decided to get the oil good and hot so it would flow better. Well- about the time the oil got to the 4 or 5 liter mark - the housing sucked in. I guess the hot oil softened up the plastic housing and the vacuum was too much for the housing. I tried to blow it back out after emptying it but by then the plastic was cold and hard. Had to fill it with hot oil, let it soak, then us compressed air to return it to sort of normal shape. The instructions don't say to avoid hot oil, and it really needs to be  hot otherwise this thing is just silly slow. And back to the beginning - this tool was supposed to make oil changes easier and less messy. This time - I got oil ALL OVER THE PLACE! Plus, I had to use my air compressor to make this thing SORT OF useable again. The canister needs to be stronger and more tolerant of hot fluids or else this thing is a dud. Too bad because it's a great concept.	-1
The "bottle"'is sturdy, but connecting parts are not.  The "seal" between the round parts come off & are loose.  I glued 1 of them, but seal is bad. I've bought 2 of these.  There are other sim ilar, which are better	-1
Leaks air, no help from the vendor. Not happy with this product or there customer service.	-1
Didn't really work..  was very slow to extract oil.  I followed the instructions and warmed up the engines so that the oil would be warm.	-1
The wand won't fit down every dipstick tube, hard to know ahead of time. This one didn't  fit my 2013 ram 1500. It did fit my mustang but once I siphoned out as much oil as possible (which took forever and hundreds of pumps even with very hot oil)  I pulled the plug to see how empty it was and another quart and a half came out of the bottom. Maybe it's the shape of the pan, maybe it would work better if you have the car jacked up on one side or the other or raise the front or back so the oil poops directly under the wand. Either way a siphon is a siphon and I may find use for it down the road in other areas.	-1
Great concept but flawed execution.  It would literally take hours to remove all 7 liters of oil from my BMW 3.0L I6 engine.  It doesn't matter if the oil is 70F or 210F.  The extraction is SLOW.  That's assuming the vacuum remained constant.  It doesn't.  I have to go back to the extractor and pump some more every 10 minutes or so.  Otherwise the flow of oil will stop.  The pump doesn't secure to the tank so you'll have to hold it with one hand while pumping with the other.  This makes it difficult to adjust the tube to get the oil flowing.  I wanted to like this extractor since changing the oil on my Audi is annoying (one has to remove a plastic splash shield underneath the car to get to the oil drain plug).  Still, the extractor is so slow I can perform several oil changes "the old fashioned way".	-1
I am not super happy with this purchase.  I have to pump it a lot to evacuate the crankcase of 5 quarts of oil.  I've used these type of products in the past and they haven't been so slow to suck out the oil.  Not real happy with the product.	-1
Doesn't work at all. If I used this to complete my oil change I'd still be waiting 3 months later. In this things defense I have a diesel that holds 3 gallons but I had to vacuum the thing for an hour for MAYBE a quart of oil. It was warmed up too.	-1
Tube was too short by 2 inches for Mercruiser  big block	-1
Takes a long time to pump out oil..	-1
Attempted to use on my boat's 7.4L.  It would only extract about 1/2 quart after battling it for 20 mins.  Too late to return it.  Waste of good money.  Stuck looking at it in a box, forever.	-1
not a very good procduct, however i did order another oil extractor that works very well this item was returned	-1
This product should not be in the market.  Looking people's feedback, I bought this trash;  It took me more than 2 hour to extract 1 quart of oil.  Think again if you going to buy this Chinese trasn.	-1
After seeing all the great reviews on this extractor I ordered it thru Prime and received it in 2days.  When I saw the box, I immediately noticed that the name and model of the unit was different than what was shown on the amazon description, but the extractor looked similar, just a different branding sticker on it.  Then when i opened the box, I noticed some marks on the extractor tube, which made me think this item may have been used or potentially damaged.  Regardless, I was content with keeping it, if it worked with no issues.  I went to do an oil change on my audi a4 (b8) and it couldn't hold a vacuum in order to keep the oil (which was warmed up) flowing. I'm an engineer and have worked on cars since I was a kid, so I certainly trouble shooted to make sure it wasn't human error on my part and that in fact the product was not functioning as designed.  This is one of the first products on amazon that I've ordered that I've had a problem with and had to return, but it was bound to happen at some point.  Thankfully the order was fulfilled by amazon, so there was no issues with returning the item.	-1
Read the reviews, did as suggested. After driving the car at 70mph for a half hour I came home and immediately inserted the tube, left the oil cap off and pumped up the unit as directed and the oil started flowing. Looks great, It works!?! After about an hour the oil is now cold and we're still only only about 1.5 litres along. So much for warming it up. Day 2 and we're still trying to get the last 2 quarts out of the engine. Yes it works, but very slowly, especially for 5w-30 synthetic oil. 20 minutes to do an oil change as one review suggested? Maybe on a lawnmower! Used by a professional mechanic? Not on the job or they'd be unemployed! I bought it because the reviews were good enough and I had a frozen drain plug I couldn't risk pulling this time of year. So it works. Good for emergencies or small oil capacity engines. To do regular oil changes on a car it is not a time saver.  The pump must be held vertical on the unit for it to work. Its a press fit and will slip the seal easily if not held down.  Dipstick tube seems durable and flexible enough for tight routing. I never worried it would break.	-1
Good work out  machine. But worthless. I pump 12-15 times then after 5 minutes the oil back flow back so you have to re-pump it. There a air leak where the black plastic pump. It's been over 6 hours and I haven't even come close to pumping out 7 quarts out of my BMW 330i. I highly not recommend this worthless pump	-1
poorly designed,  does not work as described,  pump falls off constantly, seller does not care, very low quality, upgrade to a better unit it is worth the effort and just pass this and everything else they sell by and save yourself the grief  seller does not warranty unit, manufacturer phone # is disconnected. POS, save your $	-1
works well, but for my Chevy Express van in would not reach to the oil, also had some trouble with Honda van, and a mini cooper I had to put it on top of the engine.	-1
This item does NOT prevent the rugs from slipping. Virtually un-useful!	-1
Did not work	-1
The unit comes with a rubber piece that is needed to grab a hold of whatever it is you are mounting it too like a windshield or support bar.  The glue they used to keep the rubber piece affixed to the mirror is junk.  I used it for the firs time, and it feel off.  Then the mirror wouldn't stay on, and it fell, hit the boat, and bounced into the lake.	-1
After testing this on my ATV I removed it.  First the foam lining is thin but will still snag on your gun (I even tried gluing it inside the case using foam pads to compress the lining which worked until the first time a gun site snagged and then it was a mess getting it free). Second, there is LOTS of case vibration even with the Kolpin mount (too much to risk ruining my scope zero or risk damage to the scope).  I just carry my rifle slung over my shoulder and a cross my chest while riding.	-1
The shield is to close to the face making fogging issues a problem. I bought this to replace an echo shield that was much better, reordering another echo shield.	-1
Must be made by a new manufacturer now. Bought one before and it lasted awhile. This one scratched the heck out of itself the first time visor lifted. Like someone else said, if you look at it wrong it scratches. Quality control in the garbage.	-1
Flimsy	-1
Meh item. Distorted vision (top) and shield wide opens if you turn your head riding over 35 mph. Honestly: stick with a Biltwell Bubble.	-1
near the top, the plastic is wavy so your vision becomes warped. Very disorienting and potentially dangerous. I have to tilt my helmet up a little higher than usual to avoid this.	-1
It was missing the hose, but I didn't realize it right away because I didn't winterize within the 30 days, so I had to buy another cheaper one just to get the hose.	-1
Broke after 2 months	-1
Very sorry to say, but in my opinion, this is worthless.	-1
I hadn't even used this ice scraper 10 times before the handle snapped off the head. The review by Wayne proves that this isn't just an occasional problem.  When I used it, the blade worked well on the side windows, but not on the windshield for removing frost. Since I don't have any experience with ice scrapers, I can't compare. The brush is really nice for removing snow and scraped off frost. But save your money and find another product, because this ice scraper is too expensive to have it break on you so easily.	-1
I've only had this for about a month now and it already has a leak. Not just a small leak... The tube developed a whole in it. This pump was taken care off and not abused. It was placed in a storage box when moved but still developed a whole. When it was working, there was a small back flow leak on the plunger. Also, adjusting tire air pressure by just 2-3 psi takes a while. I would invest in some thing with more quality. I thought I was saving money since I don't use the pump but a few times to make subtle tire pressure adjustments on my motorcycle tire.. I was wrong. I do not recommend	-1
WARNING!! DO NOT BUY THIS CLUB!!!! I read the bad reviews first and many said the put it on an then it was locked on and could not remove. I figure the majority reviews were good so I like the dark blue because they are hard to find. It arrived today. Took family out to Olive Garden for a night out to eat. I TRIED THE CLUB OUT FIRST!!  I extended it then unlocked it. Cool. We go inside to see people sitting on the floor and out the door a 1hr 30 min wait to eat. So we go back to the car and now on my brand new car i can't get this damn thing off!!! Tried every way possibe. Placing tension, removing tension while trying to wiggle the key. After 30 min off trying. A lock smith will run you anywhere from starting out at $100 up to$250. I had premier AAA membership and it covered a lock smith. Great! Except nearest lock smith is a hour out so total time sitting here will have been 2 hrs. DO NOT TAKE A CHANCE.	-1
Save your money. The plastic head on this item broke off attaching to the valve stem before getting a single use. The only positive thing about this purchase was Amazon's typical excellent customer service in handling the problem. I've come to the conclusion that no one builds a decent foot powered air pump. Hey Amazon, how about having one built to decent specs and sell it under the AmazonBasics brand?	-1
Worked a few times but then the metal started to bend and one of the pins came loose. I would not recommend this pump to anyone.	-1
Like many people looking for this product, I had an older one that worked great. I just can't find it anymore, so I'm looking for a replacement. This one seemed to have a short chamber; pushing a small quantity of air with each push (I might be wrong). I started inflating the front tire on my bicycle. Before the tire could be called inflated (it was still soft) the pump made a puff noise and stopped working. It is now very easy to push and it is not pumping anything. Somehow the piston failed. I'll open it to see what went wrong, but until then I could speculate that actually there might have been an obstruction in the pump's house that restricted the output of air, or the pump is so fragile, it cannot take the punishment of inflating tires.	-1
I'd rather get the LX club.  It's better looking and is better quality.	-1
Product Description Claims: This product is guaranteed for one year * up to $1800.00 against the owner's comprehensive insurance deductible. In Reality, once you open the package ( also printed in the package ) . . . it only has coverage Up to $500.00, and the limited warranty is only 90 days from the date of purchase. * The one year guarantee is good for one year IF you have COMPREHENSIVE insurance coverage. I guess people that only carry liability coverage are out of luck. I rather take my chances than registering "The Club" for Winner International having my information and selling it. Now . . . . on to the product. The locking mechanism works fine, but it does not take much effort to unlock the unit. It takes less than 1/8" of a turn to get it unlocked. ( the key turns 90 degrees from lock / unlock ). It takes almost the whole travel of the key If you use the key to lock it. I have an old ( over 10 years ) club; and on that one it takes almost the entire travel of the key to lock / unlock it. I'd return the one I just bought if it wasn't a hassle to get it packed and shipped back to amazon . . . . I guess I'll just use it as a deterrent hoping that a car thief sees it in the steering wheel and leaves my car alone.  Having the club may have unintended consequences:  [...]	-1
I give it three stars because "it is what it is". It's a theft deterrent, and it might stop the lower level car thief looking for a joy ride, or an amateur, but a professional (or even someone who simply knows what to do) can easily cut through the steering wheel and slip the Club right off. You can look on YouTube of videos of people removing the Club from steering wheels, one of them is simply whacking on it with a hammer and it opens. Also, the Club provides a thief with leverage to help him remove the steering wheel altogether, and put on his own! A better option would be a "brake lock" which slips around your brake pedal and prevents it from being used, very hard to remove.  One thing I thought was funny, I opened the package and saw a piece of paper inside, asking me to "register" the Club, as if my car was stolen and I could prove the Club was defective, they would reimburse me $1800. First of all, how can you prove that? Also, if you read the fine print, the amount of paperwork they want from the police, affidavits, papers from your insurance company stating how much your car was worth and how much you were paid for the loss (what does that have to do with them?), proof of any insurance settlement, etc....it probably isn't even worth the effort. If time is money, you could easily spend weeks getting all this paperwork together, and even then they might deny you, it's their call. I would honestly love to meet one person who ever got the $1800 from them.  I'm attaching a photo of the registration form,because it's so funny. They are asking me to "register the Club", but it's obvious they are only collecting information for marketing purposes! Why do they need to know my: income, education level, age, etc?  They probably sell all this info to marketing businesses. Of course, you have to "hurry and register within 5 days of purchase to be eligible!" And some states (like mine) aren't even on the list, for some reason. Why would a state refuse to allow a company to reimburse me for their product being defective? Something sounds fishy.  They probably sell all this info to marketing businesses.  Personally, I think the guarantee is a joke.  They only pays toward your theft deductible! If you happen to be using The Club on a vehicle that does not have theft coverage then the "guarantee" is completely worthless!  If you have a $500 theft deductible then regardless of the "up to $1800" guarantee: you will only be reimbursed that $500.  You are REQUIRED to use the original registration form that was included in The Club's packaging for some reason, although there is no serial number on it.  They also will demand your ORIGINAL register receipt, so, too bad if you lost it.  I think the fact that my insurance company won't even give a discount for use of The Club sums it all up. ----------------------------------------- Found this online:  Back in the 90s, I was working as a design engineer for Chrysler. As part of our attempt to figure out where best to invest our design dollars, we hired some professional car thieves to provide a more hands-on perspective than us engineers had.  At some point, the Club was mentioned. The professional thieves laughed and exchanged knowing glances. What we knew was that the? Club is a hardened steel device that attaches to the steering wheel and the brake pedal to prevent steering and/or braking. What we found out was that a pro thief would carry a short piece of a hacksaw blade to cut through the plastic steering wheel in a couple seconds. They were then able to release The Club and use it to apply a huge amount of torque to the steering wheel and break the lock on the steering column (which most cars were already equipped with). The pro thieves actually sought out cars with The Club on them because they didn't want to carry a long pry bar that was too hard to conceal.	-1
My wife and I recently purchased two bikes that have been sitting awhile and the tires needed some air. We thought this would be a great economical pump but while pumping up the second tire the hose sprun a leak at just 35PSI! We didn't even get a full bike operational by the time this thing gave way. Luckily, Amazon refunded our money promptly. We have since shelled out a little more coin and purchased a quality unit. Spend the extra money and only buy on pump. You never know when you will need it and the cheap one fails you.	-1
cylinder leaks air after only a few uses	-1
The price of this pump reflects its quality. It worked a short while for me, and that is all. I'd look elsewhere.	-1
This doesn't have a gauge to tell you how much air you've put in so you have to just keep feeling the tires and hope it's right...Kind of useless.	-1
Rubber coating has repeatedly stuck to my leather wrap steering wheel and removed bonded patches from wheel. The finish on my steering wheel is now heavily damaged and it will continue to happen unless I cover the club before installing. Can't get keys made anywhere either, havta go to manufacturer.	-1
I loved this pump at first but than after 2 months of weekly use it developed a leak in the hose line. This is not acceptable. I spent $30 for a Spin Doctor pump from the bike shop and it is going on one year with no issues and it has a guage so I know how much i am putting in. This deluxe hand pump is also harder to use because the little metal feet that fold out are hard to keep from moving while pumping. I would imagine this pump would be good if you would need it just a couple times throughout the year but for sustained use it would be best to look somewhere else.	-1
Just cut the steering wheel with a hack saw and you have a club to hit yourself on the head with!	-1
Unfortunately this product has made me use my least favorite expression "you get what you pay for".  There is little to no seal, and the hose doesn't stay connect to the pump. It will literally shoot off after a few depressions of the plunger.  Pumping up a single car tire was a full 20 minute ordeal after which my triceps were fully exhausted.	-1
The air hose busted open 10 minutes after I received it. Only managed to fill 4 tires for my kids's bicycles before it became useless.	-1
As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a very good clock in some ways and useless in others. The main problem is the face of the clock is unreadable at almost any angle other than straight on.  If the clock is mounted lower than your eye level - which it most likely will be -- you can't read the time.  This seems to be a function of the way digital clock faces work.  So, it's very effective in telling time, but you can't see what time it is.  Not very useful.  There's a second problem, too.  When you want to read the time in the dark, and that was the only reason I bought this clock, you can't unless it tap the right side button on the clock.  Of course, it's dark so you can't even see the clock, let alone find the button . . . so you fumble around until you knock the clock off whatever you've mounted it to. Again, not a good idea.  So, I'd pass on this clock if you (a) want to mount it anywhere other than directly at eye level or (b) want a clock you can read at night.  I'd return it, but return shipping costs make it uneconomical to do that.  Too bad.	-1
I wanted a battery-operated clock that I could easily read in the dark.  I was attracted to the large numbers and the backlight of this clock.  The large numbers are great - if you're looking at the clock pretty much head-on.  Contrary to what other reviewers have said, I cannot read these large numbers even at 15 degrees off center.  The backlight looks great in the photo - but in a darkened room it is glaring - VERY bright.  You absolutely MUST view it head-on when lighted (the slightest angle will completely wash out the digits), but the brightness of the light makes it uncomfortable to look at.  And when lighted, the numbers are a pale blue (not the high-contrast black numbers pictured on the product page).  You activate the backlight by pressing either of the buttons on the right side of the clock - but the light it comes on for such a brief period that your eyes don't have time to adjust to the glaring light.  I have to press the buttons two or three times to be able to glimpse the time.  Very disappointed.	-1
This pump is a piece of junk.  Even though it is supposed to be a "high volume" pump, it took just as many strokes to add 5 psi to the tire on my SUV as the piece of junk bike pump I had gotten from Wal-Mart prior to this one.  On my second use, the hose started leaking considerably at the base of the pump.  I used a cable tie to seal the hose to the base of the pump, and the hose burst.  Stay away from this- don't understand why it has so many positive reviews.	-1
After one use it leaked air from the clamp. Not much more I can say, at least Amazon took it back.	-1
I bought this Steering Wheel Lock because after 5 years of use my older Club 1000 doesn't work anymore and I expect that the newer model have to be better than the older one because the price is around $20,- higher than my Club 1000 (my fault). I don't now what the manufacture is doing wrong, but the red coating is sticky like glue! Even after cleaning the Lock with gentle soap and glass cleaner, the coating is still sticky. Shame on me I cut the packaging in half and put it in the trash container before I checked the steering wheel lock, so I cant send it back.  So I removed the sticky stuff wit a knife and use ist without the protection coating, maybe I will buy shrink tubing for the shafts of the Lock to protect my steering wheel.  Don't by this product!!!	-1
The gloves were too small.  Quite stiff and were not near as warm as suggested.	-1
If it uses 9.5A at (say) 120V, this means 1.14 kW. The weediest HP (metric) is 736W. So if this unit were 100% efficient it would be 1.55 HP.  Assuming (say) 80% efficiency it would produce 1.24 HP.  So, to claim 4HP is ridiculous.  Some will accuse me of pedantry, but the main way we can judge these products it to look at the figures. Quoting a figure that is three times the actual surely must be viewed as dishonest.	-1
there is no heat on these blowers, after calling the company I was told the heat comes from the fan motor and would be more noticeable when the temperature is 75+ degrees outside. why would I need heat  at that time? also, the legs are so small and short the blower falls over from the weight of the hose, if you're going to have one either mount it to a piece of plywood or cut/shorten the hose to about three feet, put a shoulder strap on it and it should be usable. in my case I'll stay with the electric leaf blower, works as well on the car and cleans the driveway too.	-1
In short, I had to return this dryer because it left spots on the surface of my black car. I tried not to dry it completely so I could wipe the mineral deposit spots off, but it was unavoidable to have some parts of the car dry. The water in the San Diego area is not specially hard. Also, it is a pain dragging the dryer around the garage floor, using an extension cord. It didn't save much time, and I'm much happier back drying my new 2011 Honda Accord with old towels.  The seller contact, David Bernstein, cooperated in refunding his $18 (as I recall) shipping cost, but not the $32.04 UPS charge to return it. He never acknowledged that the drier is not satisfactory for use on a black car, writing, "Sorry you don't care for the product," and somewhat strangely, "I understand what you are saying but everyone takes some 'risk' buying online." His refund policy was pretty good, but I would have been happier with a more customer-friendly tone.	-1
the marking wheel does not maintain the same angle through the strike it also does not rotate, I believe that the style lends its self to this kind of behavior.	-1
I've had repeated trouble securing the marking wheel on the end of the shaft. Even after adding thread locking compound, the little screw kept working loose, causing accuracy problems.  Although it's otherwise a nicely made tool, I went back to my trusty fixed marking gauge. I tossed this one into the box containing my ever-growing collection of tools that seemed like a good idea but didn't really work out.	-1
THE CUTTING WHEELS ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO ROTATE WHILE CUTTING! SOME OLDER STANLEY'S DID ROTATE. THIS PRODUCT MAY WORK FOR YOU IF YOU SHARPEN THE WHEELS AND ONLY ROTATE THE WHEEL TO GET AN EDGE THAT HAS NOT BEEN USED.	-1
Upon receiving Shop Fox D2811 Wheel marking gauge, the end screw was a loose fit ( would fall out).  The internal threads were not tapped deep enough.  The internal dimension of the scribing disk on the end is also sloppy.  Overall, this looked like it came from China....very poor quality...would not suggest.	-1
I didn't actually buy this tool, a friend of mine gave it to me. I was happy, he said he had two. I took it into the shop and what a disappointment. It is sad that companies get away with selling this low quality merchandise on the market. But sadder still, my beloved Amazon, in whom I have become a firm supporter over ten years SELLS the stuff. Is there nobody who examines this merchandise before they begin to sell it?  You would think that there would be quality assurance departments staffed with people knowledgeable in their fields with certain kinds of tools. Or send ten out to carefully selected "experts" who would try them, evaluate them, and send them back to Amazon with a critique. I have to admit, I'm scared of what I see happening with Amazon over the last few years. Walk away from this one.	-1
The rod and brass fence are acceptable, but the cutter is junk.  It can't rotate, so it kind of drags along, plus if you hold it the wrong way the cutter actually unscrews and can fall off.  I ended up just paying the extra for the titemark and removed the worthless cutter and use it as a depth stop now.  At $10 buck its a waste of money.  If they fixed the cutter so it could rotate freely and was flush to the end, it would be a good value.  One thing to watch is that the fence doesn't lock down tight, so it can loose up and slide when the cutter is following the grain of the wood. -James	-1
wheel came loose, bearings fell out	-1
This is no knock on the paste, but they put it in that old-fashioned tin which is difficult to open and close and voila! Clumsy me spills half of it on the floor. Which would have been ok if I wanted to wax the floor.	-1
The blanket is supposed to warm up the wearer, not the other way around. This thing barely gets warm at all, and definitely not anywhere near hot. It's full of warning labels but there's no point to them. Tried again in case I just got a bad one, but no, same result with 2nd one. Want a good heated blanket? Keep looking, this ain't it.	-1
I read the good and bad reviews and took my chances. I let it run for 45 minutes on a drive to town on a 20 degree day, not even cold. It does not get much warmer than just a plain blanket, unless you wrap it around your hands and double or triple it. Flat across the lap there was no warmth at all. I could feel a little heat if I squeezed the blanket between my fingers right over a wire, and then just barely. The blanket is constructed with 2 sheets of polar fleece and the wires are just loose between them, no quilting or any means to keep the wires in any particular place, like a big pocket. With no real contact the heat is as likely to just go out the top as it is to warm you (if there was any). I ended up sending it back. It was to be an extra heat source for a commuter car in the winter for emergencies (above and beyond the sleeping bags already in there) and over a little dog kennel in the car when we had to leave her in the car. The dog would freeze with this thing.	-1
Blanket 12 volt plug does not stay plugged in. The slightest bump or movement and it stops working. As for heating once you get it to stay plugged in, is very very minimal. You get more warth from the actual blanket than the heating element.	-1
Total waste of my money.  Maybe it'll keep the trash can outside warm when I throw it away!	-1
Waste of money. Worked a couple times, then...nothing. Would not buy again. (Plus not long enough to cover feet and pull up to neck).	-1
this blanket doesn't get very warm.  sometimes I am not sure if it is on.  I would spend more money and get a nicer quality	-1
Stopped working...just because.....opened it....full of rust.	-1
should not spent my money on it	-1
**Update** After three months... yes only three months and installing two of these on my car. While on, driving down the road a deer ran across the road and hit me dead center. Yes my car was totaled. I thought this was great.. However, if it really did stop deer from running into your vehicle, insurance companies would offer a discount for have it.  Total waste of money.  ** Old Review** Was five stars I loved it so much I purchase several more.  You can't use it in town, it's too loud. However, I have seen animal move off the road when they hear it coming. This is not perfect, because a sound that would scar them completely would be best.	-1
Plugged it in and let it go for a solid 1 1/2hrs, could not even tell if it got warm.	-1
I don't like it, produce birds sounds	-1
dont put out very much heat	-1
The one Amazon sent me did not work, sent it back for refund. Great looking and seems well made, but need some quality control on this product.	-1
not satisfied sent it back	-1
For about 3 weeks my wife positively reported that it worked great.  Then she ran over a fawn.  Thankfully there was no damage to the MDX.  Maybe it just works for adult animals.  I would recommend purchasing if you have a teenage driver that drives to school.  The teenager reports that it works well.  The kids she passed in the parking lot gave her more attention than a yellow Lamborghini in Miami.  She reported no near misses with humans.	-1
This crap doesn't work lol.  I live in an area that is plagued by suicidal,Emo, Kamikaze, and even Jihadist  Deer (these are the ones that don't run out in front of you, but rather into you!).  Now that Winter is approaching, I haven't had too many opportunities to see how this device interacts with the local critters but in the few opportunities that I have, this product has failed....miserably.  A specific example would be the other day I was driving up a mountain road that's notorious for these emo deer.  Lo and behold as I am rounding the corner, I see four pairs of eyes glimmering with the ambient light put off by my cars lights.  I slowed down and the whole time two of them are staring at my car, the other two off into la la land.  At the last second, one of them darts out in front of my car!  Luckily I was anticipating this and going quite slow (15mph) so I was able to avoid this Jihad-Emo Deer and save my car.  This proves that this product doesn't work at all! I have used various deer whistles and while some don't work, some do.  The only use that I see for this product, is if you own a Smart Car or any car that is quiet in terms of noise that they produce.  So that way while driving around parking lots, or anywhere in the City where pedestrians tend to not look, this will alert them.  Lastly, in regards to the installation.  To those whom found this device difficult to install, you must be perpetually stupid. A blind man with no hands could do the job, seriously.  I don't know how they find two wires to be difficult.	-1
does not work	-1
It does not work for deer or any other animal for that matter, and the cheap toggle switch just came apart in my hand one day when I went to turn it off.	-1
I returned it.  Low quality and was DOA.  The plug lit up to show it was getting power but the controller light did not illuminate and no heat was felt.	-1
I should have read more reviews, this item is complete garbage. Shorted out and broke the first time me wife used. Not happy, it will be going back.	-1
I loved my trillium 12v heated blanket. I was going to use it in my camper. I used it every day on my commute.... Until after two weeks of use it caught fire on my lap.  "What's that odor? Is it the truck in front of me? Hell no the blankets melting!"	-1
I would not buy this product again.  As best as I can recall, it lasted through one winter and that is all.	-1
I bought this for a 4x4 camping trip in Death Valley this winter, to keep the other half warm and happy in our camping van. I have ample battery capacity to run the blanket all night, and a battery disconnect so that the starter battery wouldn't be drained by the blanket.  It worked great for the first two nights, but halfway through the second night, it suddenly stopped working in the middle of the night. It never did start working again. The red light on the cigarette lighter lights up, and when pressing the button on the control box, you can hear the relay click on, but the blanket just does not generate any heat. A real disappointment.  Also, as a side note, the blanket is designed with an auto off timer. It turns itself off automatically every 30 or 45 minutes, depending on how you set a switch. My plan had been to set the other half up with the blanket, and if she woke up cold in the middle of the night, she could bump the blanket for a bit of heat.  When it did work, it worked really nicely, though. The power cord is nice and long; it was able to (just barely) reach the bed at the back of my standard length ford cargo van. The blanket has a nice texture, didn't feel cheap, and also the electronic part of it didn't feel too obtrusive. If the blanket had worked out, I was intending to put in a new cigarette lighter in the sleeping area for it.	-1
Initially, it worked fine. But after just a few uses, it started "sparking" and we figured that it was not safe, so we decided to return it. The control unit was the piece that made the noises. Just do not trust it.	-1
It was a good idea, but it will only let you keep it on for 30 minutes or 45 minutes. I got this to help keep my girlfriend warm because i always run way hot and her way cold. Well, with the 45 minute shut off if you fall asleep you wake up freezing. Also, there is no way to regulate the temperature like there is on all other heating blankets that i have ever used. It is just one heat level and its not all that hot, more like a warm, so over all I'm not to happy with this product.	-1
It is a great idea just a bad product.  It worked for a month.  I was warm and my husband didn't get cooked.  One day I turned it on and a noise like a toy machine gun came from the control box.  No heat.  I took it to my brother who is an electrician and fixes all our electrical gadgets.  He tried but said that the controls were very cheaply made and he would not spend money on another one.	-1
So I bought this to use while I sleep in my camper when it is cold. Works great, but can only be ran for 30-45 mins! After that the timer shuts it off. Went back and read the product description - says nothing about shutting off after 30-45 mins. Great for a car ride, bad for a sleeping blanket. Using a thermostat instead of a timer would have been better, I'll probably return.	-1
I plugged this into multiple vehicles and ran it through 2 long cycles in a row and it barely got warm enough to notice.  I am not sure if I got a bad item or not but it was returned via Amazon.	-1
The cover was EXTREMELY difficult to get on. It took my husband a very long time and he is strong and mechanical. He said if he ever had to take it off to get to the spare he would just cut it off. Not worth the hassle.	-1
Sent back because cover was too small to fit a 12" spare tire .	-1
Loose fit but good deal if u only need it a few times	-1
Not good. Did not fit on my civic 99. Not exactly 50mm. I measured between 48-49 mm. Very loose.	-1
Useless.	-1
Don't fit in snug.	-1
I tried this tool with the breaker bar and I couldn't get the bolt off so I put just the breaker bar against the engine cradle,put alittle heat on the bolt with a torch and bumped the starter and it loosened it.dont forget to unplug your plug connectors so your engine doesn't start!	-1
DON'T NEED IT.	-1
I followed this link from a water pump kit product (under the "things other people viewed category" ) thinking this was the right one. Well.. it kinda fit.. it was a little bit too small to fit in the hex space on the pulley and I couldn't get enough leverage to break the bolt loose without something slipping off. So instead.. Here's how you use the tool.. . Disclaimer: (DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME! PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!) Verify that the engine does have a clockwise rotation as viewed from the crank pullley bolt (my 02 acura mdx does.) Then, get a long breaker bar with a socket on the crank bolt and wedge the breaker bar against the frame (so that when the engine rotates clockwise the bar doesn't move, I used the lower suspension A arm.) . Make sure everyones' hands are clear and just Bump the start just for a split sec ( don't start it!) and that bold will come right off!!  Finally, Use the Crank Pulley Removal Tool to open your beer!	-1
It fit too loosely and broke my crank pulley...  but it got the job done...  they need to check the size better, it is not 50mm	-1
This pulley removal tool fits very sloppy on the harmonic balancer. It is so sloppy in fact, I had to hold it in place until I put some tension on it to stop it from falling out. it was able to get the job done, but someone didn't measure properly for this tool when it was mass produced.	-1
I have not yet used this to replace timing belt on my 2004 Honda 3.2TL. In the image, the tool looks like it's made of some resin but it is heavy steel.  The hole inside is large enough to allow heavier-duty impact gun socket (19mm for the TL).  I checked the Honda SST and it looked almost identical.  I will update when I'm done with the job.  When it comes to tools, I want made in USA/Japan but this tool is made in Taiwan so I removed one star.  P.S; after having used this, I have noticed that this does not fit snugly on 2004 TL; there is a slight play and it marred the corners of the crank pulley. The actual size seems to be 55mm. Genuine Honda tool comes with an adapter & a LONG bar (longer than my Snap-on 3' beater bar).	-1
I bought these instead of the WeatherTech. That was a big mistake. These mats soon lost their molded fit and they don't contain the mud and water like advertised.	-1
Didn't follow the contour of the quarter panel on my Suburban so I returned them.  Seemed well made, just not for my application.	-1
terrible fit, returned them.	-1
The visor appeared to be great. The information that they fit all vehicles is not true. Bought three of these, one for myself & 3 as presents, because they seem so nice and the description sounded good. OUCH They are from a third party vendor and they did not have a shipping label or contents information shipping slip. They came in the Amazon box so maybe it's Amazon's fault. The company is from Maine which is one of the reasons cuz I did a little research before I purchased but made in China. Company in Maine please hire some people from Maine I'm willing to pay 50% more easily.	-1
These are the most ILL FITTING crappy , no good , Lousy, cheap, no good pieces of JUNK that I have ever bought! I only wish I could just get my money back instead of just throwing them away. What a piece of S_ _ _!!!! BUYER BEWARE. I only needed ONE as mine was broken from not watching what I was doing so now I have NONE thanks to those pieces of Garbage! I just wish I could send them back! What a rip off!	-1
Google independent filter performance vs stock OEM. You'll be surprised by the empirical data when removed from the hype.	-1
Did not fit my 08 Tundra.	-1
Let me say that Amazon is usually verygood at shipping and sending the right product. But when it comes to K & N air filters, I would say go elsewhere. The drop down tabs won't produce the right filter for your car or truck. I can't believe they could be so messed up! Even when you verify the right part number through K & N the measurements are incorrect on Amazon. I ordered 1 filter for my 2002 F-250 and 1 for my 2012 Hyundai Sonata and both were wrong.	-1
Received product on time but didn't fit my car a second time. Sent it back to get money. Amazon is having a problem with its part matching tool which matches the part to the car.	-1
I get fewer miles per gallon...  It was a noticeable drop...  I put the OEM air filter back in after several thousand miles and obtained better MPG immediately. The "instant MPG" told the story right away and I should have changed it out right away, but there was so much hype about K&N products, I thought my onboard computer was not correct. Measuring mileage on repetitive trips (same driving distance everyday vs. fill-up to fill-up) proved this filter did not live up to what was promised. Secondary and more important note: I could see through it, and if I can see through it, it's not stopping all the fine particles that kill engines...!	-1
If you bought one, do yourself a favor: take it out ASAP! The benefits are questionable, but the possible damage is real.  I had K&N filters on 2 Caprices, no problems there (~100,000+ miles on each), but when I installed one in a 8.1L Suburban, problems started.  About 20,000 miles after installation, Check Engine light started flashing. I read the stored code, turned out to be Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor malfunction. Good thing I didn't go to a dealer with this (MAF sensor is not particularly cheap). Instead I took the sensor out and had a look: the body of the sensor had blackish oily residue inside. So I bought MAF sensor cleaner (you don't want to try anything else instead), cleaned the sensor, put it back. No problems for another ~20,000 miles. Then again, the same story: Check Engine light, MAF malfunction, blackish oily residue inside... And I think I know what happens.  If you do a quick Internet search, you can find a lot of stories like mine. At some point K&N tried to respond and put online a demonstration showing that oil cannot get blown away from the filter, so all these people with contaminated MAF sensors must be mad or they don't know what they are doing.  The real problem is that while oil by itself does stay where it belongs, microscopic particles of dust soak up oil and then pass right through the filter. It is these tiny oily particles that cause the problems with the MAF sensor. One is left to wonder how much dust goes right into the engine (this is something to think about if you happened to have a car with somewhat different MAF sensor that is not very sensitive to dirt).  By the way, when MAF sensor is contaminated, it starts sending signal corresponding to a lower than actual airflow. The engine controller reacts by actually leaning the fuel mixture. This will be happening BEFORE you have any error messages. And excessively lean fuel mixture can severely damage your engine (exhaust valves/seats in particular). So decide for yourself if you want all these problems down the road. I took this thing out...  In case you wonder: I did not over-oil my K@N filter. In fact, I have installed it the way it came to me, and it didn't look over-oiled. Another thing: 40,000+ miles after I took K@N filter out and installed a regular high quality air filter, the MAF sensor is about as clean as it was the day I cleaned it. The blackish oily stuff was coming from/through the K&N filter.	-1
Too stiff. In fact there is a stiffener spine right behind the bulge. I end up buying a yoga pad for the purpose.	-1
I was under the impression that this device was made of a soft material that would protect my car doors. It isn't and it doesn't. It's just as hard as the walls in my garage and provides no protection. If it were made of a softer material I would recommend it without hesitation. This was a complete waste of money. A rolled up towel stapled to my garage wall would work better.	-1
terrible fit, returned them.	-1
I won't give them too much flack as there are dozens of drill patterns in silverados, suburbans, sierras I'm sure, but then don't call them custom. I needed to have a drill on hand, and even then you can't really get these on easily. Might have been easier if I had a full jack to raise the car up overhead and could get a bright light in there to see how to put them on more easily.	-1
This is an okay waste container, but I found that it was not worth it to me to pay this much for something which has similar competition for less money. I bought it for two daughters as well as myself, and they were underwhelmed. It is good if you tend to toss wet trash in a waste recepticle and don't want leakage, but beyond that it is not worth the price. It won't tip over, which is good, but I would hope that by the time someone is middle-aged like me, they would know how to handle garbage without making a huge mess in the car.	-1
It's almost the size of a square tissue box so unless your throwing away straw wrappers you should b ok	-1
This is way too small to be useful.	-1
Size, measure it before buying.	-1
its too small, not family size, just the kids wrappers and happy meals fit there lol	-1
Middle	-1
Side walls continually want to collapse. No visible brace.	-1
I like the trash stand but the little metal forms used to make the shape do not stay in place.  I still use it though.	-1
Once I tried to use the product it was too small for my needs.  If you empty it every day then it would work well.  Weighted bottom so will not tip over.	-1
I bought this not too long ago and based on the reviews I thought I'd give it a try.  Collapses on itself. No good.	-1
Just like Morty, I make dirt, and trash.  Though there were reviews that said it was to small, I thought I knew better.  I wuz wrong.  I wish it were three or four times bigger.	-1
As soon as I took it out of the box, I just opened the trash can and the "plastic liner" immediately split apart along the seam in two (2) places.  So you can forget about the idea that this thing has a waterproof plastic liner.  I'm not sure I would put anything liquid in this thing anyway, but the plastic liner is very cheap.  It cost too little for me to go to the trouble to return it.  I'm not sure why some of the other reviewers complained so much about this thing sagging or not staying open/upright.  It seems to do that fine on its own, although I am reinforcing the two short sides with the cardboard packaging from the box as others have suggested.  It can't hurt.  I don't like the sandbag that goes in the bottom to stabilize this and keep it from moving around.  There's room in the bottom to put in a bigger, heavier sandbag that would work better.  I'll have to improvise something.  But it does have velcro on the bottom.  The top seems superfluous to me; I think I will keep it open all the time.  What surprised me is that the top doesn't completely detach as I thought it did from the picture; it's fully attached on one side so you can't remove it (or lose it).	-1
The basket was much smaller than I expected based on the photo. It does appear to be waterproof but it couldn't hold more than one large drink cup. The weighted bottom is just something wrapped in plastic which takes up room in the basket. The lid closes with velcro but doesn't really line up.  All in all, not very well designed or manufactured.	-1
the litterbag has several flaws. Pro: good size and 2 sides are rigid; durable Con: sides are too flexible. have to add cardboard to keep shape; has no way to put a small bag inside and stay; bottom has velcro but not the kind that will stick to carpeting; weighted 'beanbag' is too light;  overall, won't hold trash in a bag and won't stay in place	-1
Not happy with construction of bag. It's already coming apart after a short time in use.  I will be getting a replacement for it.  Definitely won't be from this mfg.	-1
Although it is a great product it is way too small for how expensive it is. I was thinking it was going to be a bit bigger anf after some research a two gallon just like it for only $13 dollars. Make sure if you buy the item you have a compact car. Other than that the product is great.	-1
missed read though was a four pack	-1
Case is not as pictured. Pictured is case is C115 and the one in the box is C116. It isn't as well padded nor does have compartmentsto help protect meter and keep leads separate. I have the case that is pictured bought previously a few years ago. Not thrilled with Flukes misrepresenting their product by the picture on the box. Would not recommend.	-1
Thought this kit would supplement my meter that came with twist lock test leads. First set arrived with the black lead warped. Returned and received a second kit with the same issue. The probes still provide accurate measurements, however for the amount of money that you are spending there shouldn't be any deformities. Rather than try my luck a third time, I think i'll just buy the kit components separately as needed and steer clear of the test lead probes.	-1
The leads I replaced with this set were 18 inches shorter.  This lead set is 1.5 meters long.  The extra length is like having spaghetti wire mess to contend with if you don't need it, which I don't.  I get my meter out and put it away like 50 times a day and the extra length is simply a hassle.  I wrap my leads up neatly and take care of them.  I tried to get a shorter lead set that was compatible with the accessories in this kit and found that there are none in existence.  I checked with Fluke, and they were not helpful as usual.  I love Fluke tools but 800 pound gorillas don't care about their customers.  Now I'm looking for a similar probe tip accessory set from another manufacturer whom also offers the shorter leads.  I have had outstanding customer service from UEI whom deserves recognition for that, and will be trying to buy from companies who do provide that service after the sale if possible.  I can't help but feel the money spent on this set is a waste, because of incompatibility and suitability to my application.  If you use or like longer leads, then I would tell you to buy it because I love the probe tips and the quality.	-1
So what did I get:  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/TL910/dp/B000VRJH0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">TL910</a>&nbsp;CAT II 1000V 3A 1mm diameter Backprobe Kit CAT I 300V 5A Aligator Clip CAT I 33 V RMS / 42 V pkac / 70 VDC Micrograbber CAT I 33 V RMS / 42 V pkac / 70 VDC Micrograbber Lead CAT I 30 V RMS / 42 V pkac / 60 VDC Spade Adapter CAT I "300V 5A" Minigrabber CAT II 1000V 10A 4mm diameter Probe <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/TL224/dp/B0002SRINW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">TL224?</a>&nbsp;CAT III-1KV / IV-600V Modular Lead  I'd provide more catalogue numbers and links, but I guess Fluke doesn't want anyone to figure out what they're getting.  To those who don't like this review: My review is not about the quality of Fluke, but that Fluke's own description of this product is wanting.  Based on the description I ultimately ordered this as I thought it would meet my needs, but I did not and it has been rated accordingly.  If and when Fluke's descriptions are clear, I'll edit the review accordingly.  Overall I found most test lead manufacturers to be circumspect, a bit like shopping for mattresses.  Thank you, Amazon, for the easy return process.	-1
This is an overpriced, cheaply made/designed, and useless product.  It is very bulky when closed so if you need cargo space and fold it up, it takes up a lot of space.  Removing it from your car is a hassle (less so if you can store it in your garage, but again, it's bulky even when closed).  It's also cheaply made, with the a poorly designed piece breaking off that is needed to fold the walls.  And no, I never carried it by the walls (need to carry it by holding the bottom).  It's also a waste of money for such a lame product.  Like another reviewer said, I would have returned it if I had kept the box.  I never use it and it's not easy to get rid of due to the size/bulk.	-1
didn't fit on my motorcycle.	-1
have an 06' dodge sprinter w/ dually wheels. front covers are still on but spin after popping them in place. after drilling out the rivets to remove the center cup,,and notching the steel so i could get it over the hub,, i finally managed to get the rear ones on. Unfortunatley they came off on the first trip. They do not seem to fit the dodge sprinters w/ the 6 lug and 6 hand hole pattern and i'm having trouble finding any that do.	-1
bought these for my RV, They are a bit tough to get on , which makes you think they would be hard to get off and would not fall off. Well I got about 100 miles and realized I had lost both front covers and still had the back covers.  Needless to say I was disappointed. I made sure they were on and used a rubber mallet to install and make sure they were on.  So now I am 1/2 chrome and 1/2 crap on my RV.	-1
This battery pack was given to me as a gift specifically so that I had something capable of filling a motorhome's tires while on the road. When I tried to fill the tires, however, the unit overheated and started to smoke. It never was able to put the pressure over 95 lbs and my tires needed 105 lbs. I contacted Xantrex and they were good about sending me a replacement. However, the replacement did the same thing! Totally unable to fill to the proper pressure and started to heat and smoke as time went on. They worked fine for normal car tires, though it was a slow process. Now, even normal tires, the unit starts to smoke and overheat. My efforts to try to start the engine of a car with a low battery has never worked either! It just doesn't have the juice to do it and I've had to jump start it with normal jumper cables. All above testing has been done with the Xantrex battery at 100% charge (as shown on the digital display). On the replacement battery, however, the digital display stopped working. I finally just had to write this review so that others can be aware of this experience.	-1
I bought this unit in order to have emergency power for my C-PAP breathing machine. Upon examination the 110 volt power receptacles did not work. The compressor, 12 volt power, light, and jumper cables worked just fine.  During a recent summer storm we lost power and I could not sleep. VERY annoying. Very disappointing.	-1
I bought this coil to go along with my MSD distributor.  I was running a Pertronix coil and having had one fail last year, I just didn't trust it (though it was working fine).  I received the Blaster 2, put it on the car and it wouldn't start.  Double checked the wiring and still no start.  Re-installed the Pertronix coil and she fired right up.  I then tested the MSD coil with a VOM and it showed no continuity.  The coil appeared brand new and the packaging looked factory but it was dead on arrival.  Maybe a fluke, but if you buy one of these, check it before you go to the trouble of installing it.	-1
IT DID NOT WORK, OBVIOUSLY A FAULTY ITEM.	-1
I got a brand new eleldbrock carburetor 600 cfm right out of the box.and the check ball is missing.and spent a lot of time and gas looking for one.from eleldbrock dealers in town.and internet.with nothing to show for it.maybe a nice claw hammer might fix it.	-1
I did not factor in my stars cause I miss my auto hubs though. One star cause they work, and one cause they are easy to install. Take one off cause Warn wants me to deal with my issues. two cause my issue makes me need a tool to lock one of them in and its all scratched up now. And third star off cause they are both hard to turn! I might have had better luck if I paid less. Watch out, they have some bad ones floating around and selling them online is a great way for a slimeball to wash his/her hands. But hey, they work. I just feel like I was had. Everyone should get what they paid for. I paid extra and got less. BS!	-1
While installing the hubs, I noticed the mounting screws are small and cheap. The heads round out easily. My remedy for the hardware problem: I used my metal cutting wheel in my rotor tool (Dremel type), and cut slots in the screws and used a standard screwdriver to finish the installation.	-1
I do not recommend purchasing this item.	-1
Went the extra mile to buy Warn because I'd heard they were the best brand going. Most durable and dependable winches on the market, by reputation. Apparently that title is undeserved. At least this has been my experience.  I installed the winch and tested its function. Beautiful piece of equipment. Seemed to work without an issue. I took it to a parking lot to pre-tension the wire rope and stretch it as recommended by the owners manual before first use. Hand spooled it all out, attatched it to a tee and did a brief demo to my wife briefly how the remote worked. Hit the spool in button....nothing happened. Spool out? Worked fine. Spool in? Nothing. Seriously? I've never used this thing and it's dead with 100 ft of rope lying on the the ground. I pull out two pairs of jumper cables to use as leads to test the winch motor and found the motor is fine. Spools in and out without issue. So apparently the control box or remote is broken.  So I contact Warn two days ago and I've heard nothing from them. So I have an emergency piece of rescue equipment that is nothing more than a bumper ornament. At this point I'm not sure how to proceed. I'm utterly disappointed in my purchase obviously and dealing with an unresponsive company. I may have the only lemon Warn makes , but I suspect not.  Save your money and buy something less expensive because the Warn name apparently means nothing.  Update: I finally have a working winch!! After exchanging several useless emails repeatedly telling me to check and tighten connections, and sending me a pdf of the manual I already had, Warn support finally sent me the contact number of a local repair shop. I called those guys up (Weather's Auto Supply is awesome!)and explained the problem and they told me to bring it in. Originally thought it was the control box, but it turned out to be the remote. In the process of replacing the control box, one of the motor contacts got spun off and they ended up replacing the motor as well.  So. Final verdict? I've spent more time "repairing" my BRAND FRICKIN' NEW WINCH than it is worth. I've never used the stupid thing and have 9 months left on the warranty! I repeat what I said in my earlier review.  Save your money and buy something less expensive because the Warn name apparently means nothing. Save your money and buy something less expensive because the Warn name apparently means nothing. Save your money and buy something less expensive because the Warn name apparently means nothing. Save your money and buy something less expensive because the Warn name apparently means nothing. Save your money and buy something less expensive because the Warn name apparently means nothing.  There is no reason to spend this kind of money and have this many things wrong with it.	-1
Installed the winch early May 2014. Used it once in the desert, once in the mud, and tried once to recovery a Jeep from a 2' deep stream. The winch cable snapped in half well under its max weight. So I called Warn and was told that they don't cover their cables or ropes! So I paid an extra $200 for the synthetic rope for it to last less than 3 months? No a happy Jeeper right now!	-1
I gave it 1 star because I could not use it. It does not fit my 2001 GMC Sonoma. Bowed upon installation. Also, part of the ventshade is supposed to go under the side mirror housing, putting a lot of outward pressure on the side mirror plastic housing. I think, in time, this would make the side mirror housing prone to breaking.	-1
Does not fit the 2004 trailblazer ext like it says.	-1
Didn't fit	-1
bad fit not the same as old one	-1
Well I am sure they would've worked, unfortunately for me, they came in cracked/broken.  Was so pissed that I paid for them I decided to not return them, which is my fault. But geezes, they were literally shattered even the box showed signs that they were in split in half.	-1
I don't know which F350 these fit but it ain't mine. They were so far off, I thought it had to be a case of wrong part in the right box but I checked the numbers...and these DONT FIT.	-1
Size did not fit perfectly.	-1
Broke before I even put them on	-1
Poor quality, but the company exchanged them with out any questions. Good seller not the greatest product.	-1
THE WRONG PART WAS SENT AND WE HAD TO SEND IT BACK ALSO.IT WAS ORDER TO FIT A 2000 CADILLAC AND THEY SENT A SET FOR A 2000 TRUCK	-1
It would have been nice if they new this product would fit my car.  It did not so I still want this on my car but cant find it	-1
Poor quality. Rusts horribly and appalled that it doesn't come with the mounting kit...	-1
Five months old and bags already have holes. Junk. Waste of my time and money.	-1
Be aware - Air Lift Air Springs are very prone to leaking!  So, why might that be important to you?  Well, here's what it's meant to me.  I've had these on one of my vehicles for several years now and learned the hard way.  I bought this kit assuming they held air like tires, check them every once in a while like I do my tires and I'm OK.  Wrong!  Do not make that assumption.  One sleeve went flat within a couple of weeks of installation.  I didn't know it.  Running flat these things self destruct.  You will see this mentioned in other reviews.  It's common.  Anyway, I checked the other sleeve.  It had also leaked and was low but still good.  note: I plumbed each side separately with its own valve.)  A hundred dollars later and I was back on the road but the new sleeve also leaked.  I called the factory to complain and was told that, if I didn't like having to check the sleeves every time out, buy the compressor kit.  Well, why don't they be honest about it and tell you that right up front?  For many, like me, the Ride Control Kit is not an acceptable solution all by itself.  So, if you add a $200 compressor to your order, you're now spending $400.  And you have a lot of work staring you in the face.  Thinking twice?  Why not do it right and replace the springs like you should have done to start with?  They don't leak.  I can get real nice springs for $400?  And, in the long run the installation is a whole lot simpler.  See all those little parts?  They all have to go somewhere.  All those threaded things?  They go in holes you have to drill.  Don't forget to use jack stands.)  I will admit, the kit does work well when it is aired up.  I have to add air just about every time I use the vehicle and carry a small 12V compressor everywhere I go.  It's inconvenient (imagine cold, rain, wind, snow) and I think unkind thoughts each and every time, even when the weather's nice, but they do work.  If you're still convinced to band-aid your problem with this solution, do yourself a huge favor.  Go all the way.  Don't buy just the Ride Control Kit.  Get the compressor kit as well.  Allow plenty of time.  An extra set of hands is a good idea as is a spare vehicle for those errands to the store to buy other stuff you might need.  Watch your language if kids are around.  Read the instructions first.  Better yet, read them before you buy.  Look simple?  Why am I writing this so long after buying?  I just lost another hundred dollar sleeve.  My fault.  I forgot to check the air last time.  And, I'm deservedly grumpy.  Can you tell?  Don't let this be you.	-1
I purchased from this company and one of the bladders kept leaking and rubbed a hole on the side of the bladder.  Paid to have a replacement for the SO CALLED LIFE TIME WARRANTY and would be given a refund once defective part was returned to AIR LIFT.  Four month later and I am still waiting for my REFUND.  Just get the run around.  I will never do business with AIR LIFT again.	-1
this product has a large curve and will not lay properly on a flat roof or even a slightly curved roof; avoid this at all costs	-1
The tape came unstuck and it landed on the hiway.. A car behind me ran over it.. so it was trashed.. I would not recommend this product because on the corners you have to cut little pieces of tape to make the tight turn.. I think that is how air got underneath of mine and blew it off the car..	-1
Its been on my suburban for less than a year and it has split in the middle where there is a seam. Split the deflector in half.  It should be all one piece with no seam. poor design	-1
Did not fit 2008 escape as suggested.  But my return was seamless and I am very happy with Amazon for that	-1
This was supposed to fit my 2010 Ford Escape.  They come nowhere close to being the right ones.  I accidentally broke one while trying to install (no quick judgements please, I have installed a lot of these) so I knew there was no returns because of course it would have been my fault.  I should have looked closer at what they sent.  I checked again and they were supposed to fit my my Escape but no way, no how.  I will never order from Auto Ventshade again....	-1
after about three weeks of being on my truck, the adhesive tape that comes already attached to the visor, has come lose on one of the visors, in the middle.  you can see the tape is still stuck to my truck, but has come lose from the visor itself.  i followed the installation instructions exactly.  i'm pretty disappointed these didn't last more than a month, i really liked em while they lasted.	-1
I haven't order this hood scoop but I noticed something suspicious.  The photos advertising this hood scoop is misleading.  It shows two different photos of two different hood scoops.  The main photo is completely different then the second photo.  I ordered the double hood scoops that are shown in the second photo and they fit my S10.  But when I went to see if the single hood scoop in the main photo would fit my truck it says it doesn't fit.  I would be careful for anyone wanting to buy this hood scoop.  You might get ripped off.	-1
it wasn't aggressive at all, Is just a lil bit louder than stock. I should had order the supper 44 or the 10 series. I have a Cheyenne c1500 5.7 V8 but I didn't experience a deep rich sound like those YouTube videos . I will get the 10 series instead.	-1
Even though these were advertised by Amazon to fit my Yukon they did not. This created a half day of extra work. to take them back off.	-1
The screws weren't tight for the front frame, the screws and nuts they give you to attach the light to the bracket are too small and the nuts almost pull through the bracket. It stucks trying to get the washers and nuts and bolts and bracket all lined up to tighten everything together. But when it was all together and hooked up they did work. I would never buy these again because of the bracket system.	-1
A lot of time installing, and a whole bunch more time wasted looking for the air leak. Turns out as soon as I removed the air compressor from the system, it held 80 psi without issue. It wouldn't hold 20 psi for 5 minutes with the compressor. I can see how it would be handy to have onboard air, but it's not a necessity. Cheap compressor, but everything else seemed fine. Got my money back on this.	-1
Was and Gift	-1
returned it. no place for guage and to much wireing	-1
The pump works well, but the gage and display assembly with attached pressure switch takes a lot of space under the dash.  You'd think in a full size truck there would be tons of space, but there isn't, so the gauge ended up under the steering column, difficult to see.  I could not easily get to a ignition switched power source, and for some reason, the pressure switch that is supposed to activate when pressure is under 5psi has never worked.  The system does leak down at very low pressures (not with a load on though).  Since I wired the pump to the battery with a fuse, I don't want the automatic pressure feature running all the time, so I quit trying to get the pressure switch working and I just top it off manually when the truck has been sitting a while or it is cold out.	-1
The bag blew out on my very first use. I had a 16ft trailer attached to my Tahoe that was lightly loaded down for the trip to Alaska. I didn't even make it out of the States. I was running 50psi on the bags when they blew. These are a huge waste of time and money!!!!	-1
I bought this to go with a set of air springs from Air Lift. I never got it installed though due to the requirement that the compressor had to be mounted inside the cab of the truck. The instructions clearly state that the compressor cannot be mounted under the hood or under the bed of the truck. Apparently the unit is not weather safe.  Really? The compressor is about the size of a small shoe box and not easily stored. I will have too look around for someone else's compressor to use. with these air springs.	-1
Works great with no load and as soon as I hook up my travel trailer tongue weight 900 pounds the compressor starts running and the airbags go flat. So I have to pull the fuse to make the compressor stop running.	-1
This item does not fit the Jeep Grand Cherokee as advertised and returns are a pain do not buy.	-1
They were sold to me as fitting a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  THEY DO NOT.  Far to large and don't fit at all at the rear view mirror.	-1
Wrong item, will not fit a crew cab Ford F-250... For extended cab	-1
Dont waste ur time. Invest in leafs to add to the suspension. The bags installed ok. They do lift ur suspension. But!  U will never be able to raise ur truck on a lift unless u unbolt the bags or chain the suspension. Oh. In the instructions it said u. An out ur truck on the lift for a short period of time. What they didn't say was that the short period of time was a micro of a micro second. As soon as my truck was lifted on the lift. The tires weren't even off the ground. Just the suspension was moving. The threaded bungs in the bottoms of the bag simply pulled right out!!!  So now the bag is no longer boltable to the bottom bracket. If u want a bag set up. Go to a large truck larts store. Find bags that'll fit on ur trucks springs. And make ur own for far less!!!	-1
THE BOLTS THAT HOLD THE BAG TO THE BRAKIT HAS PULED OUT OF THE BAG ON BACK SIDE AND IT BROKE THE L FITING AND CANT SEM TO GET A PEPLACEMENT BAG ON THIS I HAVE TOLKED TO A FIWE DIFFRENT PEAPLE WITH YOUR COMPANY BUT HAVE NEVER GOT ANY INFO BACK ON THIS PROBLEM SO AT THIS POINT NOT HAPPY.	-1
Ordered this set of lifts for my Chev. And  After I picked them up and sent bar code off of box in for the rebate I realized I had ordered wrong ones.  They sure look pretty but couldn't return them with big hole in box (cut out bar code)  Maybe build a trailer some day and build it to suit.  Cheers	-1

it said it would fit but it didn't.sent it back. don't know if i got credit yet	-1
Not worth it, just buy the new ones. They were previously installed so I had to replace the adhesive tries a couple different kinds and couldn't get them to work. Had wind noise with windows up and windows would get jammed on them putting them up.	-1
Ok	-1
Ok, I have a 1989 chevy K5 Blazer, TBI 350 mild build nothing special, with a Y-pipe into 3in pipe to a 40series with dual out 2.5 into 3in tips. Now when I origianlly installed this set up i still had the catilittic convertor and the sound was kinda blah, muffled like blowing air through a straw. No real depth to it, So i had the cat removed and woah. Now it is ridulously loud, way way way more than I ever anticipated and it has a horrible drone. So from my personal experience if you want a obnoxiously loud truck that drones down the highway and yells "HEY LOOK AT ME IM DRIVING A BIG TRUCK" then this is for you.... if your like me and just wanting a good depp rumble that you can live with every day try another set up. Im gonna try something elsee as soon as I can. But as far as the quality of the muffler and the looks I can say it is great, been on there for about 6 months before I removed the cat and still looked brand new and it went though a good KY winter. So in conclusion, durable, looks good but loud way loud. not something you can live with daily.	-1
The rear window ventshades didn't fit the window channel but the front are great.	-1
If you have a 2010 Ram Crew Cab and this product came up do not purchase as it is for the MUCH smaller quad cab windows.  For some reason Amazon's (make sure it fits) app did not work on this one.  Luckily amazon was good about it and paid for return shipping I had to order mine from truckaddons.com and spoke to a salesman who got me the right part the first try.	-1
Not pleased with carb. Flood, can't adjust. Tried carb on two engine , same respond.	-1
Do not fit the 2007 Ford Sport Trac. After cutting, the channel mount visor sticks very well to (buffed) felt track. But curviture of the front visor is all wrong.	-1
terrible. had a good rain yesterday and went out to check how so called water repellent this was, lol well it sucked. it almost was like not having a cover on at all. Too bad its too late to send back.	-1
This cover is NOT waterproof.  A ton of water comes through this thing and pools on the top of my roof.  If you want waterproof, look elsewhere.  Its more of a dust cover than anything else.  Super disappointed.	-1
Very cheap material. No way is this waterproof. This is essentially the material you get in shipping boxes that covers things you don't want to be damaged in shipping. I can't see how it would last more than a year. I returned it because the fitment was terrible for my trailer.	-1
Do not waste your time and money on this. It lasted one month on my Coleman camper before holes started showing up. It fit loose and was under a pole barn so it should have lasted years.	-1
Only lasted 1 year in Arkansas weather.  Disintegrated on the top where it was exposed to sunlight.  Sides were still in good shape.  Might work better if parked in the shade as a dust cover.  As others have noted, this does NOT keep the camper dry.  I have had other covers of similar price that lasted 2 seasons.  I don't expect much more.	-1
order arrived in tore open box. The camper cover has a tear on it. am not happy at all!!!	-1
fits fine, doesn't do anything to protect my camper. I pulled off my cover and my camper was filthy, and the dust/dirt was baked on and left discoloration, I ended up having to hand scrub the white back. Into the garbage this went.	-1
Only lasted 6 months, bought two from Classic before, both lasted almost two years.	-1
I normally don't write bad reviews.  Unfortunately this didn't even last a season - barely 5 months and already started to rip at the corners.  I realize this isn't made out of some uber strong material - however under normal circumstances (simply covered in yard) normal wind shouldn't rip through the corners...  This is a dust cover at best.	-1
paper thin and ripped the first week.	-1
Very disappointed with this item. It's tattering and tearing in less than a year!. I live in So Calif, so there's no snow here...The material used in this cover is horrible! Apparently the fabric has no UV protection, so it appears that it sun rots very rapidly. I would not purchase this brand again, nor would I recommend it.	-1
Purchased in the end of December and two months later I discovered a two inch by two inch triangular tear in an area that is not in contact with the camper top. Not happy.	-1
This item is NOT WATERPROOF if your buying this to put on your trailer that sits outside hoping to keep the water off of it do not buy it. I purchased this item a week ago first rain on it today and the water goes right through it,i should have known since you can see through it that it is nothing more than a glorified dust cover an 8 dollar tarp protects it more than this i am returning it.	-1
After less than a year, I'm disappointed with the trailer cover. It was quite damp underneath and has holes where the trailer corners are (from just sitting) and a large rip in the center for no apparent reason from use. Certainly not useful for more than a season and not worth the price. Basically it's just a dust cover as long as it doesn't rain.	-1
I was very careful choosing this product and read all reviews carefully. Unfortunately, we have an older model (1996 Jayco) with an A/C unit. I ordered the 12-14' cover and it was great on the lenghth and width. However, due to our a/c it would not cover the sides. I was quite disappointed and will continue looking for one that will fit longer sides.	-1
I had a need for a new fuel pump on my 2007 Bayliner 175 open-bow with a Mercruiser 3.0 4 cylinder. The dealership wanted $165 and had to order it and wait a week. Amazon had this for $99 on my door in two days. It took ten minutes to install it and ten minutes to drive to the lake and enjoy the rest of my weekend. I highly recommend this pump if it fits your application. It worked great for me.  Edit: I got a few outings of mediocre use from this pump. The engine wouldn't run right, I thought it was timing, it was this pump. It finally seized up and stopped pumping all together. As a result, I'm changing my review to 1 star. This is not a recommended replacement. Now I'm off to find an OEM pump.	-1
Has failed twice on me now.	-1
Does not fit a 1985 Mecury GM 4 cylinder ... It's for newer style ..  Amazon issued a refund as soon a it was received by ups at the drop box..	-1
U-bolt's diameter is too thick to fit on the hitch of the 2015 Audi Q7's factory receiver.  Does not leave enough room between hitch and receiver to be able to insert a locking pin.	-1
Not a universal product depending on your specific hitch and its profile.  Bent easily at specified torque level.  Ordered three for various locations, will at most use one as one useless after torqueing to instruction level and hitches not compatible with design.	-1
I installed it as directed. Directions say tighten to no more than 60 foot pounds. So I set my torque wrench to 40 foot lbs based on the size of the bolt. Plate started bending at around 20 foot points. And it didn't really hold the hitch. Either the slots are too large to allow for smaller ubolts or the plate steel is too soft.  Also. The pictures show an anodized nut. While the bolt was stainless, nuts and washers we're just regular zinc plates hardware.  Sent it back. I'll just live with the rattling.	-1
This didn't work very well on my 2016 Ford F250.  This truck has a class V receiver and the clamp is NOT designed to fit this receiver even though it has a 2" Pocket for a class IV receiver.  They should have mentioned that this will not work on F250 Trucks.	-1
I have a Ridgid hitch installed on a 2016 Outback, and use a Curt folding aluminum carrier platform, and the Curt platform has a sloppy fit. I thought this might solve the problem, but there is no way to install it.  The U bolt is too short to accommodate the weld in the stinger when I try to put it with the bolts down. If I try to reverse it, with bolts up, there is insufficient room to get the bolts on between the receiver and the body of the car. Will be returning it.  I just drove 2100 miles without it, with the sloppy fit on the carrier, and it was fine.	-1
two stars since the ubolt and plate arrived in the package, but the washers, lock washers, and nuts were NOT in the package per the photos here and per the sheet (rev 0816, StowAway Hitch Tightener Instructions 020.6, 020.61) included with the ubolt and plate.	-1
Does not seem to fit my 15 Tahoe factory hitch very well.  The chain plate gets in the way, so the ubolt does not slide up flush with the receiver top to bottom.  Tried reversing it, putting it on the side, on top, no dice.  It works, but there is still play in the hitch cargo carrier.	-1
Black plate is very sturdy. The u shaped threaded bar has stripped. It locked the nuts on there and I ended up cutting it in half to take it back off.	-1
This product does not fit my hitch.. I would return this but my 30 days expired.  Would like to still have a return considered.	-1
It worked well until I tried to un-install it, the Nuts are frozen or stripped threads trying to take it off. No one can get them off and and not buying another one.	-1
these are completely useless for 1 1/4 in hitches, the bolts hang too low and make the ground clearance even worse, and forget about adapting a 1 1/4" to 2" adapter. the bolts are too narrow to fit over the 2 inch adapter. I got these to gain ground clearance for a jetta using a cargo carrier. the bolts on the 1 1/4 in hitch hang 2" lower than the hitch!!! and scrape over every thing and if damage the bolts good luck getting this piece  of junk off, will need a hack saw. And forget about using a 2" adapter, these bolts are too narrow. I got two of these for hitch and 2 in adapter now wasted $35 for junk. Better and cheaper to get to hit home improvement stores and get bolts wide and short enough to fit. don't wast your $	-1
This works assuming you don't have anything to work around, and that any adapters extend far enough.  I couldn't use this with a bike rack because the bike rack had a 2" to 1.25" adapter which didn't stick out far enough to "grab" the adapter...which was where I needed to reduce the slop.  Then I later got a cargo tray, and it sort-of works but it doesn't work well with the clamp-on-tube wiring holder I have, because this depends on the receiver having no other clamps protruding from it.  I was able to use it on the tray, I just had to put it farther down the pipe so it just barely grabs the end of the receiver flange -- it seems to remove most of the slop in spite of being not in the "right" position.  UPDATE: Finally gave out...during a recent trip with my cargo carrier, I was pulling out of a parkinglot which had a "bump" as it met the road.  Everything seemed okay but when I went to remove the hitch-tightener I found the bolts wouldn't budge.  Apparently the bump I ran over was enough to stretch (or somehow otherwise damage in a way that isn't directly visible) the threads so it was stuck on my car in spite of having no load on the shelf at the time!  I finally managed to get under my shelf with a big torque wrench to get enough leverage and loosen the bolts enough that it wasn't grabbing and I could slide the whole mess off my car.  I wish the "over the tube" bar was a bit heavier metal, then maybe it wouldn't have had trouble.	-1
So this hitch tightener is number one.  "Only because it is the cheapest" I got roped in on this. It does work but after a few uses the metal bends and the nuts come loose. I will buy the shim hitch tightener that won't bend this one maybe useful on a bike rack. It's just not going to keep its shape if you carry heavy loads.	-1
might be good for a very light trailer.  this u-bolt stretched under load and was rattling away in no time at all.	-1
Black metal piece tends to bend allowing slop on heavy loads. The ones with the metal bar across in place of the metal plate work better.	-1
tightened worked well for couple days then loosened up and I tightened it and now it still rattles around.	-1
I needed 2 of these.. one for my hitch to pull travel trailer, and one for my cargo carrier (carrying a moped) on the back of the travel trailer. I spent $46 on 2 dollar ubolts and brakets... and scrap metal steel worth literally nothing at a scrap yard... So that's what I did. returned these, bought own 2" u bolts, drilled holes,(local hardware stores sell) Angle Iron, and I cut the angle iron at 2' wide but instead of cutting it inhalf at corner of the "L", I left a 1/2 of steal so after cutting steel would resemble the shape of a "L" which replicates the shape of the bracket being sold here. Drill holes and you not only saved yourself a HUGE chuck of change but also didn't let inflation make the best of you and you can feel good about doing something yourself!!  With a little time and little effort, I was happy to save $40 and honestly it also feels good when people ask me about mine or me making them one.	-1
nuts got stocked and bolt threading was damaged (not so much heavy duty), I was expecting more from this name brand, STOWAWAY.	-1
is come in no really good conditions,is good package but still comes with scratch and is not that easy to remove those scratches because there are everywhere and is not looks good i just said because i installed in my car because i don't really like stay writing this stuff but it is necessary	-1
I purchased this Torin 2.5-ton floor jack (Mod# T84025) from a big, orange box store. The description here in Amazon, as well as the Northern Tools and Home Depot web sites said this is an "aluminum/steel" jack. You would think that the jack being made from "aluminum" would result in a much lighter floor jack than those made completely from steel. However, when the jack arrived at my door, I noticed the weight wasn't a whole lot different from my (then) current 3-ton jack. Even Torin's regular steel 2.5-ton floor jack (Mod# T82501) weighs 83 pounds, so a ~20-lb difference between the two didn't impress me much. Curious as to how an "aluminum/steel" jack could still weigh in at 60 lbs, I took my trusty magnet out of my toolbox. The only aluminum pieces on the jack is the receiver for the pump handle, the side chassis, the back wheels and the side handles. That said, this is a good-looking, stylish floor jack. It functions well, and the key details like button-head bolts, make this look like a well-designed and built device.  Pros: - clean lines; smooth finish - nice details (button head bolts)  Cons: - no pad on the handle to protect the lower edge of the car - not as lightweight as one would expect - no saddle pad - under load, one rear wheel lifts about 1/2" off the ground  If you're looking for a true light-weight floor jack, this may not be what you want. If you want a nice looking, lighter-than-some-others jack, then you'll like this one. I would have rated this at 4 or 5 stars if the description didn't make it seem as though the aluminum portion of this jack would result in a weight found in the lightweight, racing-style jacks. In all fairness though, the descriptions at all three web sites did say this weighed 60 lbs, so it's not as though the weight was misstated.	-1
Hydraulics failed on this jack after barely any use. I think I used it maybe 4 times over the course of less than two years. I actually have two of these exact same jacks, but now plan on buying something else. The one pictured on my review here was purchased off amazon. I used it only when two jacks were required at the same time, so it saw very little service. Nevertheless, it still failed recently and started leaking all over the garage floor. I'm not sure if it's even worth attempting to repair it.  I would advise against buying this brand of floor jack if longevity and/or safety are a concern.	-1
I have had nothing but problems with this junk jack since day one.  Do not buy it.  Total waste of money.  The handle and release mechanism has never worked correctly.  The "aluminum" in the description made me think it would be a lighter weight - easier to position jack.  WRONG.  It's a heavy jack and it's a piece of sh*t.	-1
I ordered a set of vent visors for my 99 f150 and loved them. They fit into the window channel, which gives them a sleek, finished look. The set that I ordered for my Excursion are attached to the vehicles paint with double sided tape. I think they look hokey, like a cheap aftermarket product. If I ever order another set, I will find a set that fits in the window channel.	-1
These didn't fit properly. They were just a little bit off, but enough to easily notice, especially while installing. I had to decide to cover the window fully, or have this fit in its intended spot. I had to bend these to get them to fit. About 15% of the 3M tape is serving no purpose because of improper fit. From far away, these look fine. They do their job keeping rain out and they are still hanging on, so 2-3 stars based on that.	-1
I have a 93 Jeep Charokee with Vent Windows. These not only prevent the Windows to open, but the Driver side Ventvisor Doesn't line up very well.  Passenger side is MUCH better. They would be ok on Jeeps WITHOUT Window Vents. I Plan on returning them. I would NOT recommend this for PRE-94 models.	-1
I have written you 4 times and contacted Amazon but no one will help me. I have explained that I had damaged product and I am only seeking a replacement to the damaged VENTSHADE. No one will help me and everyone simply ignores every request to resolve this. I will never buy anything from you again and I will not refer you to anyone. This was a simple fix but I guess not simple enough when you just ignore your PAYING customers. Very disappointed in this whole mess. I have asked for this to be fixed for 3 weeks now. Thanks for ignoring me except to get my money, Johnny Austin I AM STILL WAITING FOR HELP GUYS!!!!!!!!!!! MAYBE A CALL TO THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU WILL GET YOUR ATTENTION.	-1
I contacted the manufacturer and sent some picture upon her request and they will send me out a new one for me to try. Very easy to work with and quick when sending e mails also.	-1
it came off after 6 months.	-1
Didn't work for project. Product was well made	-1
Ordered this bug deflector for a Kia sedona mini van and received one for a GMC yukon?!	-1
right product for the wrong truck, or the other way around.....description wasn't good enough to pick the right item.....it's sitting on the shelf un-used	-1
I bought these because I was enamored of the set on my Ranger 4x4 that I bought elsewhere a long time ago. my first issue was they stick to the chrome trim instead of going in the window channel.  I don't think that will be robust in the long run. my second issue is they are very short on the front side windows.  the truck ones extend down far enough so they block the sun from my peripheral vision.  these never block the sun when it is to the side, morning or afternoon(commute time).  I hate swinging the regular visor back and forth as I drive they do allow you to crack the window while driving or leaving the car parked on a hot day.  although I can't open the window as much	-1
Wonderful easy to install product! Love the finished look ! Already getting compliments on how good they look on my car. Just one issue however!!!!! After a few weeks, the back passenger vent shade no longer sticks and started flapping around at the end when I drive and I have to keep it down with black tape.. I'm thinking about taking them all off because that one looks tacky....I'm a little disappointed now.	-1
Shade installs easy but installation plastic screw do not hold and vibrate loose.  I contacted manufacture about plastic screw problems and requested replacement parts. I was told since I purchased it thru Amazon I had to seek replacement thru Amazon.  Said it was Amazon policy. Amazon web site no help in seeking warranty.  I recommend if you must buy this item, don't purchase it from Amazon.  Beware that the plastic screws are cheap and will not hold.	-1
wrong size	-1
This Vent Shade is 1/2" inch longer no way it will fit or work for Odyssey I don't understand why this company don't check the measurement before sending them out. I am very disappointed!	-1
The product was supposed to fit a 2004 Odyssey, however, it is not an exact fit. Ii leaves a small gap on the very top rear where water will seep through. I had to get creative and ended un slightly cracking it as a result. The crack is not too noticeable but it will likely need to be replaced in the future. I do not recommend this product for a 2004 Honda Odyssey.	-1
Looks good but the fastening hardware is junk.  I did exactly as the instructions described, but the dang thing is loose.  It moves about and inch or left and right.  Seems there should be some rubber washers or something to hold this in place.  Contact the company and all they did was send out another hardware kit which didn't solve my problem.	-1
Damaged goods.  The box was okay but they didn't put the bolts into a secure bag so they came rolling around in the box. We thought the item was okay until we installed it today (got the product on Saturday) and found several scratched on the vent from the loose bolts.  This is not okay.  We throw away the box, so we can't return it.  We are left with a damaged vent shade. Not happy.	-1
Recieved this and thought it was wrong one.  they sent another.  holes do not line up on hood.  i was not going to drill holes in my brand new truck.  then they will want to charge you  for return shipment.  Spent 20.00 more for a lund or better quality.  avs is the cheapest brand out there.  Should have known you get what you pay for.	-1
Cheap cheap cheap.  One side shattered before I was able to affix it to the truck.  Absolute garbage - do NOT purchase under ANY circumstance!	-1
Was purchased with window vent shade kit from same manufacturer except Amazon other customers I guess bought vent shades for a 2015 F-350 but a hood/bug guard for a 2007 F-350.  Duhh	-1
The bug deflector looks super nice on my 2001 f250 ,however there are two things that kinda bugged me ... 1st- it needed a little bit of modifying near the 2 rubber spacers mounted at the front of the hood,the function of those spacers is to keep your hood ligned up with the fenders,so it took about 10 minutes of modifying "NOT A BIG DEAL" if you got some tools on your hand . 2nd -what pissed me off was that after I mounted it on the hood I tried closing the hood to see how the finished product looks like and Sure enough the hood won't close ,I had to shut the hood with more force In order for it to close . Still ...not a big deal ,it closed. After all that said and done I was shocked to see that there was a scratch near the AVS emblem on the front of the deflector and its really noticeable ,so now I don't think I'm gonna be able to return the product because Ive already done the mods on it ,so a piece of advise : inspect the product before you mount it .	-1
Product doesn't fit all the way around the front, leaves exposed area. Packaging was very flimsy and didn't feel protected. But package did arrive VERY FAST, and was installed in less than 3 minutes	-1
product is scratched, the plastic shrink wrap all torn product was full of dust, just a total mess.	-1
did not fit.	-1
Very unhappy with the fit. Had to do a lot of modifying to make it look right.	-1
I have used ventvisors by various makers for many years. Some were not very durable and cracked or broke after a year or two. I paid the premium for the Auto VentShade brand because I thought the quality would be superior, but was disappointed. Some of the pieces were scuffed or scratched to the degree that I was unable to buff out the defects. On other pieces, the plastic edges were conspicuously rough and jagged, and ragged tape was showing beyond the edge of the plastic (see photos). I made the mistake of installing these on my new car but, due to the shoddy workmanship, I'm not at all pleased with the appearance and will probably remove them. Really!!! Four pieces of plastic for $50 and this was the best they could do?	-1
This deflector, while well made, is not compatible with the 2nd generation Nissan Murano. The roof of the Murano is curved and there are seams on each side that prevent proper adhesion of the deflector to the roof. I installed following the directions to the letter and the deflector worked great the first day. The second day I noticed that the corners had already started to come unstuck  (2-4 inches on each side). This clearly posed a safety hazard as it was only a matter of time before the deflector came off at high speed in the rain or snow. I unfortunately had to return because it would not work with my car's roof design.  All in all this is probably not a bad product for cars with a flat, seamless roof.	-1
I'm giving then 2 stars only because when I purchased this bug deflector they had a promotion with $25.00 mail in rebate, the item it's good and it fits and looks great, however they didn't honor the rebate even after I sent a copy of my proof of purchase along with their rebate form, I'm very dissatisfied!	-1
First item didn't arrive. Amazon immediately shipped out a replacement to make it right. I purchased it as it says to leave 1 inch on each side of the sunroom. That measured out to be 38.5 inches for me. However the visor is too long and does not provide a very nice fit. I probably could of gotten away with a step down on the size. I drive a 2009 Chevrolet silverado. I also have noticed since install that it makes a noise when open that sounds almost like leaves are trapped up around the visor. However after close inspection there is nothing in or around the visor that could be causing this. So i assume it is the seal on the visor. Contemplating removing all together.	-1
I RETURN IT	-1
Poor instructions. Needs to be cut out around grill brackets to clear brackets on 98 GMC sierra. Otherwise decent product.	-1
Did not fit my truck, can't talk with anyone to find out why.	-1
Messed up, had to return,,	-1
My items I purchased were damaged & now I have to return. Not happy with my purchase.	-1
I had a heck of a time trying figure out the instructions and only then realized that the attachment pins, weren't long enough and hardy enough to stay locked-in their holes, to keep the hood shiled in place. I am still hopeful that I can find some soft plastic attachment pins, that are about a half-inch longer. I do not have the hood attached to my 2002 CRV at this time.	-1
This serves very little purpose. I no longer use it and just tie my two kayakes on to the luggage rack.	-1
I made a mistake getting this for two kayaks. Get the Hull-a-Port if you're hauling a 12+ kayak and 10ft kayak. It's MUCH faster to use that over this. It was taking me FOREVER to securely tie down my kayaks. Ended up getting the Hull-a-port during the sale and I am MUCH happier with it's easy to load capabilities. I just needed something that took less time and I'm not happy with this device.	-1
These do not work.	-1
Horrible never worked battery would definetly go dead don't get it	-1
I loved it the first time I used it but it quite working after the first use	-1
Did not do what it is supposed to do!  Do not feel it is worth the price!  Will Be Returning it soon!	-1
The Koolatron Battery Saver did not work for us. Although we already knew our car would still start after 4 hours with the Koolatron cooler running, this is probably too long.  We wanted to keep the cooler running for stops on the next road trip, but to shut off before the battery got too low.  We tried 2 of these units in 4 different cars, and the greatest time the battery saver would allow the cooler to run was about 4 minutes after shutting off the car engine.  The "at rest" voltage on the 4 car batteries ranged from 12.1 to 12.8 volts. We did discuss this issue with Koolatron customer service, but didn't come up with a satisfactory solution.  We did like the fact that Koolatron does have someone to talk to without a long wait, which is rare today.	-1
Does not work on Toyota Sienna minivan.  The Toyota Sienna minivan is listed on the seller website as a vehicle that this tent will fit, it does not!  The vehicle has one spot on each wheel well for the bungee cords to attach and the tent is not large enough to go under the vehicle.  On the top there is a large (6"-8") open "V" where the top of the tent and side meet which would allow mosquitos inside the car.  There are several styles of this type of tent, most much more expensive and larger.  I thought I would try this tent because of the convenience and cost.  I would not recommend this seller or product.  You will be forced to pay return shipping costs, because this is not a Amazon product, it is sold by a third party.  Buyer beware!	-1
Bought 2 & both were old & cracked on the back	-1
As other reviewers have mentioned, this item completely deteriorates just from being in your car. The materials can't handle heat? I'm in NY. The average heat that builds in a car in the sun is apparently enough to destroy this item. No direct sunlight necessary.  I had this organizer on my visor but never used it because the quality wasn't great to begin with. At some point it began to spontaneously crumble into a million black shards of plastic. I kept finding these black scraps around my front seat and at first I didn't know where they were coming from. Well, any time I pulled the visor down enough to block the sun, black crumbs were falling into my car. Once I realized where it was coming from I removed the organizer and it literally crumbled as I did so. Nothing left but a paper-thin piece of cloth and a few handfuls of black shards to pick up.  I purchased a different organizer from another company (Rubbermaid) for the same price, and couldn't be more pleased. It's heavy duty and still looks new after years of use. It has a much higher quality look to it.  Skip the headache. There are better items in this price range.	-1
Not a great product just about sums it up. It's purpose is to hold cds and it does a poor job.	-1
I didn't like this cd holder because glue from inside it got on several CD's and no matter what I do the glue won't come off it just spreads I tried warm soap and water no good ruined a CD spinning cleaner glue just got onto the inside of the CD cleaner maybe someone can make a suggestion	-1
I purchased a B.B. brand battery but was sent a generic, instead.  the photo and item name both mention BB brand but what I was sent was not the type shown in the photo (same size and voltage but not a name-brand item, that's my point).  I would not buy from this seller again.	-1
This battery will not hold up in the Rotax Kart.  I bought 2 batteries and neither lasted for over 30 minutes.  Both failed such that the voltage dropped to "0" volts under any kind of load and neither battery would take a charge.  This battery is junk for the Rotax application.	-1
Too small	-1
Broke, twice...get a flexible acrylic one	-1
It did not hold up. Plastic broke within 3 months. Would not buy again. Very disappointed.	-1
Looked nice but broke when the first rock hit it.  Suggest buying the flat type that is guaranteed for life rather than this product.	-1
ALL CLEAR ONES ARE ILLEGAL IN NJ!	-1
Was broken when delivered.  Poor durability.  Not worth returning.	-1
This cover cannot be used with a "trim ring".  Seems its designed to be used by itself.  It is so thick and poorly designed around the edges, you must use longer than normal screws/bolts to hold it in place.  The plastic is very easily scratched as well.  Just a simple wcleaning wipe with a soft towel will scratch the surface.  Cant see this one lasting very long.	-1
My glove compartment box is always a mess, so I thought this would be a great thing to get.  It is a good idea; however, it falls short because it is so cheap.  The ink on the registration wore off on the plastic, it gets stuck in there, and the heat melted off the glue for the velcro so I have sticky stuff all over now.  I don't recommend this at all.	-1
The material is of poor quality, which is understandable due to the low price.  However, registration has to be folded many times to fit this wallet. Why is it Registration Holder when registration does not fit it?	-1
I ordered this over the other Insurance/Registration holders because I liked that it did not advertise some company's name on the front. However, the product I received is actually says "BELL INSURANCE & REGISTRATION W A L L E T" on the front. It is a completely different product than being advertised.  The dimensions are also different than Amazon says. The real dimensions are roughly 5.1 x 4.75. For me this was a good thing, because it is already much wider than I need. There is Velcro that keeps it shut, but also partially blocks the view of your insurance/registration. The plastic is also a bit loose, although not really loose enough for stuff to move around too much. With a bit of wear I can definitely see that being a problem though.  Edit: The seller tells me that the product advertized on this page is no longer being made. Why I see them still selling on this page is beyond me, but they refunded me, so I am happy.	-1
bad plactic	-1
Very cheap. Threw it in the garbage	-1
The frame is fine and looks nice but I couldn't believe that the fasteners were plastic (very cheap plastic) I tried using them and they all broke! 30 minutes trying to get them out and then a trip to autozone to pay $2.99 for 4 screws?	-1
Doesn't work very well and broke after three uses	-1
It's all plastic.	-1
Quality is less than expected. Accurate within 3-4 psi.	-1
Product looks and feels VERY cheap!  I hope it works well and is accurate, but a I anticipate it to break due to its weak construction.	-1
Pretty cheap, I'd recommend Milton's heavier duty Pencil Gauge:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Milton-S-925-Pencil-Tire-Gauge/dp/B002XMW8RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Milton S-925 Pencil Tire Gauge</a>&nbsp;for passenger cars or one of Milton's other offerings per your specific needs. The Milton units are not much more expensive and EXTREMELY well built (in the USA). Way better than this flimsy plastic gauge.  It works, but the feel in hand leaves a lot to be desired. If you could buy these in bulk for like a buck a piece I'd say it was a great deal and give them out to all my friends.	-1
I thought this gage was steel after reading the description and answered questions from the seller. The tube is really thin steel but the head and clip are plastic. And feel very cheap and weak. I guess I should have known from the price.	-1
When I bought this it was on sale for around $5, down from original price $95.  That's right 90 dollars off retail price.  The description said it was fully made of metal, I don't remember the exact wording but it made it sound pretty nice.  This is absolutely not made of any metal whatsoever and absolutely not worth $95.  It's very light and flimsy.  However it does read to 100psi and it was only 5 bucks, so I give it one star for price and one for function.	-1
I do not know how anyone can say this product works.  The commercials show a man using the product on a black sports car, and it dries like new.  I have a black Cobalt and used this product for the first time today, in the shade, and in 74 degree weather.  I followed to instructions exactly and after rinsing I noticed the soap had left a white film all over my car!  The water was drying spotless but the soap wasn't.  The water also wasn't drying "before my eyes" either.  I still had to end up going over my car with a cloth to remove the soap film.  After I use all this I will not be buying a refill, if I even use it again.  Luckily this was a gift or it would be going back to the store!	-1
EDIT: Customer service for this company was NULL.  They simply ignored me for a week and then after persistence they finally told me they would not replace the 2.50 cent fitting!  That is pretty bad.  I was not impressed as soon as I opened the package with quality.  The fittings feel like the cheapest things you can make.  The gauge seems ok for the money and the hose feels alright, but the fittings are junk.  I had to destroy the fitting and the threads on my head to get one of them out which was a very expensive endeavor.  Another note is DO NOT thread this into a flathead motor, they will fit the threads but are to deep and will hit the piston...I KNOW THIS.  All together I would say as usual when you buy something cheap you get something cheap.  Look for a nice professional gauge set if your a professional shop, these are not worth the frustration and will not last at all.	-1
I am quite dissatisfied with the quality of product. The Compression Tester being used for the fourth time in a deep spark plug cavity, would not thread out. The hose crimp at threaded end would not hold and had to pull hose off of threaded insert of Tester. I was able to remove other end with long nose needle nose pliers. I was fortunate to be able to get insert out and made for a tense moment. Now can I find a small clamp to reattach hose and allow access to deep plug cavities.	-1
Works as advertised, repeatable measurements, and comes well equipped.  No complaints. -----------------------------  The above was my initial review.  I used the tool for the second time yesterday, and it got stuck in the spark plug hole; the hose would simply spin on the threaded bit - I had to get creative to extract it, but I finally got it out.  The knurled surface on the bit does not have enough grip on the rubber hose, and it spins when you try to un-screw it from the spark plug hole.  I even tried crimping it harder to no avail.  Serves me right for buying cheap tools.	-1
Product is great but need more of it, still rattled the plate number, better off getting others for the price like audio technix	-1
Ok, this pice of dynamat is less than a HALF a square foot, and its 10 dollars? wow. apply common sense here, nothing is worth 20 dollars a square foot, a piece of foam will do the same.	-1
This amount covered 4 doors on 2005 Tahoe and both A and B pillars. Did nothing to deaden the sound from outside car, from what I understand you need to do roof and floor for this to reduce sound to where you can tell and in some cases use a mat on floors. That would be over 800 bucks worth of material for a 6-8 db drop in sound. If your looking for a sound reduction find a cheaper material or get ready to spend close to a grand. 2 stars only because I noticed slight gains in music quality but even then I feel it may be in my head. before you say it wasn't installed right, I had a professional shop do the work.	-1
Installed half of the box in a 2013 Ford Focus ST. I targeted my door panels, the hatch area, and parts of the floor I could get to without ripping up the carpet. This product made NO appreciable difference to the road noise in my car. I measured 73~db on the same stretch of rough California highway before and after installation. In the end, all I did was add 8lbs of sheet metal and tar to my car.  Dynamat did absolutely nothing for the conductive road noises and vibration in my car. Unless you have panels and screws that are rattling loose, you'll probably experience the same disappointment. This product isn't cheap, either. The "stop road noise" in the product description is very misleading.	-1
Don't waste your money. This is a wallpaper seam roller that you can buy at the hardware store for three bucks.  It isn't intended for heavy materials like Dynamat. Jeeeez!	-1
Dynamat makes two versions of this roller, a cheap one and a more expensive one.  The more expensive one is rather overpriced and should probably cost about the same as this one.  This one, unfortunately, is so cheaply made that it is just not very usable.  The wood roller (instead of the hard rubber of the better one), means that it slips along the Dynamat instead of stretching it, and pressing it harder into the surface, which is necessary to get rid of the little gaps and bubbles that reduce performance.  Even though the more expensive one is overpriced, I still recommend buying it instead of this one.  If you buy this one, you'll probably be back in short order to buy the better one, and that will waste even more money.  Here's a link to the better one:  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dynamat-10007-Professional-Heavy-Duty-Roller/dp/B0007WTE08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dynamat 10007 Professional Heavy Duty Roller</a>	-1
Received diff item then shawn in picture.  Very small and plastic. Had no time to waste to ship back.	-1
Does not make a noticable enough difference in sound quality to justify it's cost. I installed it inside of my doors using the roller and lots of elbow grease. All parts of the dynamat that I installed have good contact with the metal. I would return this but it is stuck to my car door...	-1
I paid a professional auto sound dampening installer nearly $2000 to put Dynamat Extreme in my 2014 Toyota Avalon Limited that has soooo much road noise.  It was simply unbearable on the freeway.  I had the doors, trunk, firewall, and entire floor done.  I also had the Dynapad laid over the flooring Dynamat - I was told that would ensure sound coupling.  The only benefit was the doors but had very little if any effect in deterring road noise.  I was so angry at all the hype and promises on how wonderful Dynamat products are.  I feel the same way as the person who did his Toyota Highlander!  It may work on older cars, but the new more rigid body structure vehicles just cannot be helped.  If you go to Dynamat sites they typically display older cars - that should have been my first clue.	-1
Under the pressure of use the product quickly deforms. You might be better off with a better-made product. Nonetheless, for a small job, this would work fine.	-1
This roller do not work well. I only used it several times and it fell apart on me. The spindle or whatever that holds the roller in place broke off while I was in the middle of my work. I end up holding it with two hands to finish my project.	-1
I really hear no difference in sound deadening claims. It may minimize rattles but doesnt seem to have quieted road noise.	-1
I paid a local shop to install a double layer of dynamat in the front and rear doors of my 2007 Toyota Highlander.  $500 labor and $300 material.  It did "thunk" and blocked a lot of sound from passing cars but did not reduce road noise from my own tires... measured at 83 dB at driver ear at 35mph and 86 dB at driver ear at 65mph.  I read a lot of reviews stating that treating the floor, firewall and wheel wells would reduce noise substantially and bought another $600 worth of dynamat and mass loaded vinyl, and put off the job knowing it would be a hell bitch to do.  After more than a year of putting it off, decided to tackle it this week.  It was complete hell yanking out all the plastic trim.  You have to take it out in the right order, like a jig saw puzzle that only fits together in one order, and the pieces are not numbered.  There are 3 different types of trigger connectors under the driver seat alone.. and they work in inintelligible ways.  Every piece of sheet metal has razor edges and I was cut at least a dozen times just brushing against them.  It took about 3 grueling days.. pulling out the console.... you must release the gear shift to get the trim out, etc. Installing the mat was the easiest part, and only took about 4 hours.  Then I cut the heavy MLV and covered the firewall and under each front seat.. single piece.  And also under the rear seats.  Got it all back together expecting something fantastic... and was shocked and outraged that even before I turned on the Radio Shack dB meter, there was absolutely no change.  83 loud dB of tire noise at 35 mph and 86 dB at 65 mph.  I can only conclude as another reviewer did: that tire noise is 95% of the cabin noise, and that because of the way the vehicle is constructed... at least mine... the tire noise is transmitted through the frame and to the cabin... not so much through the flat panels on the floor.  The reason that there is "almost no sound deadener" on the floor panels, is that it doesn't help and car makers know that.  I am pretty close to outraged at the misprepresentation by this fraud industry, unless somehow my Highlander is different from most cars.  And the door treatment did boost the bass.. but door bass now overpowers midrange which does not aim directly at the listener, so most of it gets lost.  Horriffic waste of money for me.	-1
Not worth the money for what you get. If you want to do deaden the sound in your car you'll need more than these two little squares of stuff. If you are doing a repair and you need a small amount to replace some that was damaged this might be worth it but these two small squares alone in your door won't help one bit. I don't recommend these unless as I said you only need a bit for a repair job.	-1
When looking at these products, simply calculate the actual cost per square foot. for example this"speaker kit" contains 1.38 square feet, for around 22 bucks(price fluxuates like its a stock or something?)can u think of anything thats worth 15 dollars a square foot? there are so many cheaper alternatives. dynamat is an awsome product, and it does work. but for those of us not made of money, search this "butyl flashing tape" u will be glad u did.	-1
This brand is very expensive and it really does not perform as it's much less expensive and better quality competitor, FatMat. The adhesive was not even really sticky and the vibration damping was any good either. Thank God I got this small bad small taste of this Dynamant Extreme, because is not good at all and it's the most expensive of all the sound deadning brands. Go with FatMat, it's much better and less expensive	-1
Ok... well... I finally got my scan tool in the mail and I was all excited to use it.  I mainly bought the unit to assist me in diagnosis and LIVE PARAMETER readings, which it did none of.  I went through the horrible written manual and it mentions in there "Field Service", which is what Actron calls their LIVE PARAMETER readings.  I start reading the instructions to use this feature and all was good.  I plug it in, go through the instructions just to find out that the unit itself DOES NOT HAVE THE "FIELD SERVICE" option!!!!!!!!... so that means no live parameter reading at all, which greatly disappoints me.  I will be sending this unit back.	-1
Two things come to mind.  First, the "Scangauge II" does everything this unit does plus much more (calculates your MPG, etc), for less money (they have a website, check it out).  Second, if it's just a check engine light you're trying to deal with, don't go to a dealer or mechanic.  Auto parts stores (Checker, Autozone, etc) have scanners like this and will usually check your car for you for free.  No cost, and in less than 5 minutes.  Hope these suggestions are useful, rate my review as helpful if you like the ideas.	-1
Just save yourself the trouble and buy the extreme version instead.	-1
Sadly my product arrived damaged and I was unable to use it.	-1
I returned because it is just too much work to install and I find it hard to believe they would make much difference.	-1
If they were well made I wouldn't have to replace them all the time	-1
First: False advertising. The packing implies it covers four doors, nowhere on the product description does it say it takes 2 sheets to cover one door. The product photo hides where it says this on the package.  Second: It's a lot of money considering Ice & water shield (the kind used for roofing) has the same effect. How do I know? When I realized I'd been had on the packaging, I wasn't about to get ripped-off twice. I finished the back doors with Ice & Water shield, did a sound comparison. All four doors are the same size and have the same speakers, I faded back and forth, hearing no discernible difference.  Conclusion: Save your cash, find a neighbor doing his roof and ask for the end scraps.	-1
The fabric does not stay down when you move because it is too small.  Also, consider that if you bend down, the skirt will dip down.  There is no tie for the waist or some sort of snap at the middle point.  I'd consider this a design flaw.  The hood is short on the head.  The hood is even small on my 10 year old so I would not count on it protecting you from rain.	-1
While the lock seems ok, it is not what was pictured or what was written in the description. It has a regular key lock not the Type A key which is a spring loaded, 7 pin, high security key,(round key) as pictured or described in the write up. Disappointed with Amazon on this one. Never had any issues with anything ordered on Amazon til now. I specifically wanted the type of secure key pictured and thats why I chose this particular lock over some others I saw. Probably be returning just on principle.	-1
I bought this and another similar product to compare.  This was the loser due to it's smaller size and less cushion.  I'd recommend the other product for sale here:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/MAXSA-Innovations-37357-Park-Right-Car-Door-and-Bumper-Guards/dp/B000GKAZVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">MAXSA Innovations 37357 Park Right Car Door and Bumper Guards</a>	-1
cleaned ok but does not prevent water spots.	-1
Fell apart after a few months of use.	-1
Bad Customer Service Policies  The included manual includes a phone # to call, stating don't return these, call the phone # for replacement parts.  One of mine needed a 4x30mm shear pin (they call it a GB879-4x30 Spring Pin).  The pin was cracked in half length-wise new out of the box and fell out in 3 pieces.  CSR agent was fine but their policy is locate the part # and they'll ship it.  I located the part #, then they stated can't send the part because it's not in your manual.  Huh?  It's a part on the jack and clearly was defective.  They expect me to pay return shipping on 30 lb item to exchange it instead of just sending a 1/4 ounce shear pin in a USPS envelope which IS A PART THEY LIST.  It's even more ridiculous that I waited on the phone, got cut off waiting, spending over a half hour to find this out.  Besides the fact that I now can't use one of mine (!), it's a reasonable quality jack stand.  Stand plate metal is thick enough, reinforced legs 3/4" up, double locking is nice, especially if I end up having to substitute some other shear pin (which may not be the same shear force) because they refuse to honor their warranty.  Center column is reasonably thick iron, thick paint job on it.  Saddle is beefy enough but no center notch for unibody car *frame* hack points, but it does dip down and you can get saddle covers to adapt it.  Hey Torin:  If you don't want to honor a warranty, don't offer it.  This would have been no big deal at a brick 'n mortar where I could just inspect them at time of purchase and pick a different set instead of this extra hassle for a defective 50 cent part.  I want to add that their customer service rep was not rude or incompetent, seemed to do her job fine but was bound by their strange policy to not replace the defective part.  She did state I can ship the whole thing back but meh, I bet that costs 2/3rds of what the whole set cost, over 10X as much as my having to hunt down these shear pins somewhere and buy a pack.  Would only buy these again if I could inspect them first, and only then if there wasn't something else of fair quality near the same price.	-1
They are not flat and wobble diagonally. Tested on multiple surfaces and locations. Had to return.	-1
I thought this was a pair of stands I received 1 stand. It's a nice stand but I needed a pair.	-1
I ordered 4 of these total. For the purpose of supporting my whole car off the ground. On the box it says it is not designed to be used like that. In this ad it does not inform you of that, so now I have to return it at some lost of my time and money.	-1
Poor welds, the welds were sloppy with too many issues.  Small for 3 ton jacks and poorly constructed.  Will use for small projects but nothing more.	-1
Didn't even get the 2nd stand out of the box - first one wobbling on my kitchen counter.  I'm not a welder, but even i could see how poorly the welds were laid down.  Even the paint was marginal with large splotches of dried paint on top of the primary coat. I knew what i was getting in to at this price range and took a gamble.  The welds MAY be functionally strong enough, and the poor paint application purely cosmetic - but I really can't handle the fact the stand doesn't sit level - there must be literally ZERO quality control at these plants. Still deciding if I want to try again to get a decent pair of these, or just upgrade to the 6-ton OTCs, which are a bit out of my intended budget.	-1
I already own the Torin 6 Ton Jack Stands with the Locking Pin, and the Torin 3 Ton SUV Jack Stands.  Both pairs are great and I use them very often.  I needed another set, and liked the way the locking pin works on the 6 Tons, so I thought I would give these a try.  So why the three star rating?  Well, the pair I received - the pins were not aligned properly making them both a pain to use and moreover unsafe to use.  When I would raise the jack to height, and attempted to slide the pin in, it would not slide without lifting the extension arm with the other hand and "finagling" the pin into position.  Think about that for a minute - typically, I slide the jack underneath the car (which is still being held up by the floor jack), and I then slide the arm up to height, and insert the pin.  Note that I try to get this done quickly as the car is still only floor jack supported.  With these, I would have to find the height, and then have to try and use two hands while lying down under the car to jimmy the pin into alignment with two hands.  I did this once and realized these were not made correctly.  Not sure how these got through QC - then again, seems like lots of things get through "QC" these days....  So why didn't I just exchange them as QC issues happen all the time?  Well, I tried two sets and both sets had pin alignment issues.  Enough for my blood - I just was not one of the lucky ones I guess.  Two for two with issues on both are just plain bad odds.... besides, I am trying not to support companies that allow such blatant QC issues "slip through" for public consumption.  As a result, I probably won't be buying anymore Torin Jack Stands - and take solace in the fact I have two good stands already.  Let's face it - two for two on defective products is more than chance.  Sadly, I was not happy with these - and I really wanted them to work out.	-1
This thing sucks and dosent fit in the vehicles it says it dose. It also comes in like 30 pieces and you have to put it together with the horrible directions it has. don't buy waste of money and a lot of time	-1
