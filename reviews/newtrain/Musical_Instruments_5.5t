It's light and has great sound for interviews. I would recomende this mic for any station  and we are Z108.net visit us on the web and hear it live.	1
Good knobs.	1
I installed these on a Mexican Precision Bass, replacing the stock plastic knobs.  There is not much to say about them - these are cosmetic items. They installed easily, and look nice.	1
fit perfectly. look like the originals. Thanks	1
I had a Mexican telecaster that someone replaced the pots and control plate to metric Alpha pots.  Had to drill bigger holes in the control plate for my new CTS pots to fit, and then realized the knobs that came on it didn't fit the new pots.  These fit perfectly, and they look great!	1
Gives excellent base response. Highs sound natural. With a mixer, you can make it sound like your right there. Large diaphragm makes it just as good or better "Price" as a Studio mike. Own a studio mike, Can't tell the difference other than the price. Planning on getting 2 more. Get some noise from holding mike. Put on a stand and it's perfectly quite.	1
I've used these for acoustic gigs when I've run the sound, and the artists themselves can't tell the difference between these and an SM58 (with a windscreen on, the darker screen ball is covered up). From a sound standpoint, they're identical. Don't know yet about durability, as I've only had mine for about five years.	1
Excellent mic, rugged with great sound and zero extraneous noise.  Does not have an on/off switch which is a bit disappointing.	1
This thing has a napoleon complex, it sounds big but is small compared to others. I love it on hot, with the U.K sound it's perfect for me, especially since this is my first amp, I've heard others that haven't sounded as nice. And it doesn't get in the way either!	1
Stock, fits well	1
Excellent knobs. Much better than the ones that came on my G&L ASAT Classic	1
Bought the wrong size... wish these had adapter sleeves!	1
This is a very low entry level mando that someone decided needed a pickup.  The ONLY thing holding pickup in the mandolin are the two screws which retain the pickup to the pick guard.  The pick guard is then secured, sort of, to the mandolin with four screws.  Nothing secures the pickup to the mandolin, directly.  Consequense: the pickup is free to vibrate, rattle and shake around on the flexible pick guard.  How can that be a good thing?  There is NO truss rod in the neck of this mandolin.  While that might be acceptible on an eighty dollar mando, it's a crime in this price range.  Any natural wood neck is going to warp, eventually.  Neck warpage is a matter of fact caused by string tension and humidity.  When this neck warps, it will require a major overhaul to correct on this instrument.  The repair would likely cost more than the purchase price of this thing.  The tuning machines are junk.  The "knobs" on the tuners are glued-on plastic, meaning, there are no screw securing the knobs to the posts.  My mandolin arrived with a tuner knob broken completely off.  (The nice thing is, I was able to replace the entire set of tuners with identical parts for a retail price of $12).  The pickup is a single coil "lipstick" unit that, actually, doesn't sound too bad once you find an acceptible level of volume and tone.  The pots are terribly noisy to adjust when plugged in and powered up.  This is the sort of symptom I would expect from a 20-year-old piece of electrical equipment- usuall caused by an accumulation of dust and dirt.  I am more than a little disappointed that it presents such noise in this new mando.  All said and done, anyone looking at this mando should either spend a few hundred dollars more for something of greater quality or spend a couple hundred dollars less for a "nameless" mando of equal quality.  It's a shame that Fender has lowered itself to the point of putting its name on this junk.  I think Epiphone probably has the good sense not to follow suit.	-1
No issues with this purchase or seller.	1
The real thing	1
Excellent!!	1
the sound over the shure SM48.. i compared both on the same mixer.. also it is slightly hotter than the sm48.. for the price and sound plus its a real metal microphone with a sturdy case.. all i can say is wow! good job behringer on this one....	1
I originally was planning on purchasing 2- 3 packs of xm1800s, but after hearing the difference between the xm1800 and the xm8500 it was a no brainer. I was looking to get 5 vocal microphones on a budget for a band that sings loads of harmonies in every song. I really wanted Sure SM58s, but the budget did not allow it. I normally stay away from Behringer due to bad experiences with their consoles and compressors etc., but these microphones were a game changer for me. They have a very full and even tone without any mud or extreme plosives, also an excellent output level to the mixer. I was able to EQ them easily for both male and female vocal ranges. I was told by all 5 singers that they could here themselves loud and clear through the monitors. I was also able to get a nice even mix on the front end. I do not know of anything better for the price in live vocal microphones right now.	1

Certainly there are better mic's out there, but you won't find them for $20.00.  This would be a good starter mic for the novice who is just starting out.  I would recommend this mic to a friend.	1
Great microphone for guitar / singer.  Don't over pay for your microphone.  Behringer has got it figured out.  Great Deal!	1
Bought this so my mommy can sing karaoke on YouTube. Also my cousins use it when practicing before using the condenser microphone before home studio recordings with my focusrite 2i2 interface. my cousin and I can perform live at house parties and events so as to entertain the crowd. So it was something that was necessary. and not waste of money or an unwanted item. Also i don't really have to use headphones because it is a dynamic microphone which reduces loop back when using skype or playing video games and talking to your friends, so now i can listen through my speakers.	1
These knobs fit great for solid shaft potentiometers.  A small set screw on the side of the knob allows you to tighten it so it doesn't come off the shaft.	1
These simply are what they are. I mean, they do their job exactly as you would expect them to and they look and feel the part.	1
Great flat top knobs. Fit my Telecasters just fine. Would and will buy again. Been using them now for a few years.	1
Love these	1
good quality knobs	1
They are knobs.  They use a set screw.  You can use them on a split shaft if you align the set screw with the split (that keeps the shaft from bending under the pressure of the screw.)	1
bought these to install on my Jazzmaster. They are official Fender tone knobs, and work perfectly on the Fender Blacktop Jazzmaster.	1
Very happy with these knobs. Needed to replace all 3, but found that one of the knobs on my guitar was the OEM which matched these. I did order 2 sets, but only needed 1. Amazon gave me a refund on the 1 set return. Thanks Amazon : ) Also, the fit on my pots was just like factory. The locking screws is a straight blade screw (not a hex type). The chrome is flawless and makes my bass look great again.	1
overpriced for what they are but what ya gonna do? they are perfect replacements for the knobs gone missing from a 20th anniversary squier P-bass. Actually wish I'd found a way to buy just one as only one was actually missing from the used bass when I picked it up. Got a spare now I guess.	1
nice metal screw down to shaft knobs...not much more to add here....how much of a review can you write on a metal knob??..LOL!	1
Works great especially for the price. Just put a little more highs and mids when you eq it, and its pretty close to the sm58.	1
Nice mic - good quality, no problems and have used this heavy over the past year.  Sounds identical to my Shure SM58, but MUCH less.	1
I have ran karaoke shows for over 13 years. If you're familliar with a large event of people having too much fun, you can imagine how much abuse a microphone has to handle. A friend of mine that rents sound equipment turned me on to this exceptionally durable, reliable and affordable microphone. Sounds great and is perfect for my special needs. I use a lot of Behringer products and have had exceptional performance and quality from all their products.  A+++	1
Works great for the parties I use it for - sounds nice and clear. Sturdy construction. Much cheaper than comparable mics. I wish it had an on/off switch, but most mixers have a function for that anyway - no big deal.	1
I bought this to use in Children's Church.  Works great.  Has a nice sound.  Well made.  It has held up with all the kids using it.  Great value for the price.	1
I got one of these several years ago, brand new.  Lately I have been reading lots of reviews for gear again, and felt a need to review this mic.  Its a really good one for the money, similar to the SM57 or 58.  I now have an SM57, and a 58, both are great mics. The 8500 is good, very similar. I think if you take care of your stuff, and have realistic expectations, then its a good buy. For a time, I only had the 8500 mic for my home recording. I use the 8500 and a Peavey mic now as backups, and mostly use the Shures.  FWIW, my mic came in a padded case, with a mic clip, but did not come with a cable.  A lot of mics don't come with the cable, unless its some sort of package deal.	1
this is the best mic for its quality and its price. perhaps on par with other brands but very much affordable.i will buy another one of this.	1
While the guitar had a good overall feel about it, once I plugged it in and started to play it, I was as disappointed in it as so many others who just could not get by the dead pickups. I like another reviewer was torn between a blacktop (at a lower price) and this guitar. The problem with the blacktop, is that it had worse reviews than the 72. This may all come down to personal preference, but the guitar was sent back.	-1
I have over 120 guitars in my collection, and had high hopes for this one, but the wide range pickups let me down big time.  These pickups are supposed to run in the 10K ohm/5H range, so should be a bit above the medium output humbucker pickups; THEY ARE NOT! Admittedly, I like a hot pickup, and had never tried the wide ranges before, so partly my bad. I rarely return a guitar, and this is only the 3rd or 4th in the past 10 years of collecting guitars. I chose this guitar over the Blacktop, as it's reviews were worse than the 72 which had mixed reviews itself mostly centering around the muddy pickups, while the Blacktop bad reviews were around workmanship issues. While the 72 was not for me, I have been having good luck with the Fender FSR ash guitars, and have never returned one of their amps.	-1
What a great guitar. My collection includes a 1998 deluxe american strat, a 2008 deluxe american telecaster, a 2011 american standard strat, 2 american specials and a blacktop strat and this one is hands down the most versatile,comfortable and quality-sounding guitar I own, it screams FENDER Classy-ness for the lack of a better term. It stays perfectly in tune, it was nicely set up at the Fender Factory, Kudos to you guys! It is simply flawless, and the 3TSB is beautiful. The sound of the wide range humbuckers is powerfull yet nice and tight. Hope this review helps. Amazon delivered it on time and did an excellent job protecting my investment	1
Very high sound quality, especially for the price. It is a fantastic mic for gigs or for many applications. If you want a good vocal mic for recording, I would splurge a little bit and get something a bit better though.	1
I bought this mic for my daughter and it works well.  The only complaint that I have is that it does not have an on/off switch.	1
I haven't used this mic much, yet, but so far it has a great sound. It is loud and projects the voice out front of the music. For 25 bucks I don't think you can beat it. I'm happy so far. I may buy some more of them. It is not "too short" as one reviewer complained. It is a standard length just like the SM-58.	1
This has a much better range of sound than the Logitech H250 stereo headset with boom mike - voices sound deeper and richer. The one issue I have with this mike, I really have to blame on my environment - it picks up every noise in the room. If you have a sound studio this isn't a big deal; otherwise like in my case, I found myself doing a lot of editting to reduce or remove extraneous background noise in between talking.  I bought this together with a 15 foot XLR-to-1/4" mike cable, and plugged it into a EQ/mixer to remove any ground loop before inputting it into the computer. Works like a champ, but I can hear planes fly over in the background (I live a mile from a runway) and I can hear quiet noises in the same room, and noises from the other rooms in my house. Maybe I will build a sound-blocking studio room one day to get the full effect of this mike.	1
I like this mic very much. It sounds very nice for vocals and seems to be very well made. I do not use it in a professional capacity though but it certainly seems well enough made to stand up to plenty of use.	1
This looks and feels like a more expensive SM-58. For the price I will use it in places I wouldn't use a Shure...	1
20 dollar microphone that basically works?  Perfect.  Case, perfect.  Can't tell the difference between this and a shure that costs 5x as much.  Go OEM philipino manufacturers go.	1
Don't let the price fool you on this mic!  Does a really good job. I play bass and sing in a worship and praise band and  I have and use sure mics SM57 and SM58, but these Behringer mics hold their own along with my sures.  I really don't like Behringer equipment, however, these mics are an exception.  If you're on a buget try one of these mics out and you will be suprised!	1
These mics are working great for my podcast recording. I bought 3 and they all sound great. They look, feel, and work as good as mics that are 2 and 3 times the price.	1
Bought this mic for my daughter and she has been using it alot. Great quality for the money and works well. Mic is as described.	1
Items arrived quickly. Picks are good for mandolin.  I prefer to use Dunlop Ultex regular size 1.0 for guitar playing.	1
These picks are incredible and I would give them ten stars if I could! I won't use anything else besides fingers now if I can help it. I started with the teardrop but ended up switching to the tri after trying to buy some in a store and finding only the tri shape. Well they are awesome and the tri shape even better than the teardrop. They don't wear at all like regular picks, which I would trash quite fast playing acoustic, leading to having annoying beveled edges as you get on tortex or nubby shapes you get on cellulose. The .73mm have a nice bit of flex to them for strumming, but plenty of control and snap as well, for scalar passages. I hardly ever drop it and having three surfaces with which to play means that wear is even less than it might have been otherwise (which isn't much in any event).  If that wasn't enough, they really bring out those gorgeous mid-highs that people spend lots of money on boutique effects boxes to get. Your guitar's tone will get that extra little bit of mojo a good boost pedal gives, but without battery or cable.  If you don't like them, what are you out anyway, a few bucks? Give them a go,  you won't be disappointed.	1
I bought this from Woodstrings Music thru Amazon for my Fender Frontman 25R. It fits perfect. I'm mot sure why they don't list it as one of the amps. If you have a 25R don't hesitate, buy it.	1
The amp cover is nothing fancy, but it does the job and was reasonably priced.  It's what I expected and wanted.	1
I purchased 2 of these mics and they are just the best in my opinion and the members of my band.	1
I bought three of these for my podcast, and they sound great. They are not toy mics, but should be for the price. If you were not looking you'd think someone handed you a $100 microphone. If my show expands I will buy more of these great mics.	1
Arrived really fast! The product works just fine, Fits on import split shafts, like a Squier Strat, obviously the real Fender American Strats. They fit nice, just be firm and press it down. Look very nice, the comparison between the stock knobs on my Squier deluxe, those were "plasticy" feeling, these ones feel nice and smooth and there is a special "silky" coating on them and point being, they feel nice.	1
These look good and are easy to read. Installed on a 1976 Strat with no problems at all. The color is perfect.	1
They certainly came on time and were well packed. The best is that they fitted the guitar like new. The one thing I have learnt is that leaving quality guitars in shipping cases in the Tropics, where I live, is not smart. The original pack guard, and all white parts, turned brown. Without suppliers like this, what can be done? Buy a new guitar?	1
I purchased a few sets of knobs for trying different looks on my guitar build.  These are for Volume and two Tone knobs for a black guitar with rosewood fretboard and birdseye Maple Head on the kneck.  May have to build a Wine or a Red painted body and use these, as the Black body on this project is going to have Black knobs.  Knobs, kinda sounds sleezy if you think about it.	1
At first may feel stiff, but is the best. Even its deterioration clearly signals the time to replace the pick as opposed to eye-test wear and tear of other picks.	1
It works great for karaoke purpose! The sound is clear and loud. I used it couple times now and I don't have any problem!	1
I use these mics for live sound in place of the SM58s that they mimic. In the photo, they look they the same as the Shure version, but they are smaller in size in every way. They still have the heft of a 58 and they sound surprisingly similar. The metal windscreen is smaller and much tougher than a 58 - I use these mics when I'm running sound for bands that like to swings mics around and generally abuse them, but don't want to bring their own mics.   I bought 4 of these mics initially and will be buying more. A couple of them have been dropped, kicked, and thrown across the stage a number of times, but I can't tell them apart from the ones that have been treated better. With an SM58, I would definitely see some denting on the windscreen at least - not with these mics, though.  Having only used them for live sound, I haven't been able to tell the subtle differences between these mics and the Shure versions. They seem to have the exact same output and sound practically identical to my ear. I've tried other cheaper mics, but I generally stick with the more expensive brand name mics for my work - these mics are the exception and I would use them in place of a 58 without a second thought. The only downside I've found is that they pick up a little more handling noise when in a mic stand - touching or hitting the mic stand transfers more noise than with more expensive mics. Handholding the mic, or swinging and kicking the mic sounds the same.  A bargain at twice the price!	1
I've been videotaping product promos for three years now. I went from using lavalier mics, to shotgun mics, and most recently to this Behringer Ultravoice XM8500 hand held mic. I can honestly say that my clients have never sounded better. Full rich sound without the complication of having an on / off switch, or battery.  Also for some reason it seems to focus more on my client's voices, while picking up less of the background noise at the conventions I shoot at.  Thank you for a great value!!	1
I've owned this in the past and liled it enough to get it again. Very clear vocal mic, but if you are looking for the warmth of a shure sm58, you'll still want an sm58. This is a great, reliable mic for things like open mics and backup. I'm going to use it for Native American flute, vocals and percussion.	1
I understand that this is a VERY budget mic.  I put it next to my Shure SM58 and it sounded VERY close to that mic.  For the price difference it is difficult to justify the Shure, but there are gear snobs everywhere....I should know...I am one of them.  I rent out gear and instead of using my Shure mics I use this in case it gets dropped or whatever.  Sounds very clear, minimal feedback, and seems very well made.  I have bought Behringer products before and been happy with most of them and this one is one of their hidden gems.  If you need some good mics and don't have a lot of money I suggest trying a few of these out.  I think you will be very surprised.	1
love is a perfect microphone for karaoke and mobile DJ live use it to provide live entertainment and I love your reception is perfect and not recommend it	1
This is a great quality microphone and at a good price. Keep it mind it is XLR, for those that haven't noticed. XLR is a better quality than other connections. It's the same physical shape and size as a rock band microphone (Looking for a good comparison.), and is MUCH better quality. It's flawless in quality and doesn't give any feedback. I would recomment for anyone, especially having such a great price.	1
Bigger version of my favorite pick, this one sounds exactly the same but I personally prefer the normal shape/size.  Big thumbed players will appreciate this version though.	1
Best pick for steel string ( O,12 gauge sets)  and Nylon string. The most durable material that is widely available. The tone is also beautiful. I also use very small  Dunlop JazzIII ultex for electric w/ 0.09 gauge sets. This size facilitates strumming very fast (Al Di Meola style for example) and is also great for hard bop Playing Pat Martino style ( Pat uses this shape and also a Fender/D'andrea regular shape heavy pick) It must be stated that for some artists with a very wide dynamic range and extraordinary technique such as myself and some of my colleagues, more than one type of pick will be necessary, depending on our changing musical demands. If one choses to be  more restricted styistically in expressive scope, one pick size and weight may suffice. I professionally endorse Dunlop products because I use them regularly in my professional work as a musician. Enjoy!!!	1
They are Fender, of course they fit...	1
fit my cts pots for my strat project so very happy and very fast shipping	1
These are knobs	1
Great product !  Would Recomend To A Friend !!!  A+++	1
Well, it's a vinyl-type cover and it fits over the SCX2 nice and snug.  There is no padding, so no real protection, but it should be great for storage or short transport.  If this cost any more money, it would lose a star.  But it is surprisingly affordable, and is appropriately priced for it's functionality	1
I have a Fender Super Champ XD which it is supposed to fit however it is a super tight fit at best and is a pain to tug all the way onto the amp. You really have to force it on. The biggest  shortcoming however is that the opening for the amp handle is way to large and it's off center so the handle doesn't clear the edge of the opening. This all made me wonder if it's a factory second. I should have just spent the extra for a really good cover. If I were gigging more regularly I'd have returned it. The shipping was fast though.	-1
This cover fits my Fender Frontman 25R perfectly. It appears to be well-made, and is just what I was looking for. Highly Recommended.	1
Fairly nice. Fits my Vibro Champ XD perfectly. It has creases in it like the picture, but I don't care that much. It's also thin, but its only to cover my amp in my office, it never travels. If it weren't for the creases, I'd give it the extra fifth star. You will probably have to unplug your instrument before the cover goes on.	1
We needed a durable and reliable vocal mic for our home studio, and this mic has exceeded or expectations. It is a nice SM58 clone, and that's a good thing--vocal clarity is very similar to the 58, it is built like a tank, sounds great, and fits the bill nicely.  Came with a stand clip and a plastic case, and would make a nice addition to your PA or home studio.  The good:  Excellent build quality, hefty, nice sound, super price--has held up very well over the last year. The bad: None, yet.  The kids love it.  Summary:  If you're looking to outfit your band or studio on a budget, snag this mic.	1
This is a very nice microphone for the money and for general voice over work. I would not use this mic for professional singing, just spoken word.  I have many microphones, and this compares to the $50. range mics.	1
This microphone is good enough for semi-professional recording, but it creates noise when I use it, which is not good for professional musician.	1
I love these picks. I started out a guitar player decades ago and then wound up picking the bass for about eight years. I used a pick and got used to playing with the heaviest pick I could find. About seven years ago, I got back to guitar and just kept using the heaviest pick I could find I use my fingers to modulate how rigidly I'm striking the strings with the pick. Anyway, if you like a heavy pick, for bass or guitar, this is a great one. It stays put between my fingers really well. The only time I have issues is when my hands are super dry and there not enough moisture/softness to create a good grip but, that's not the picks fault. This would happen to most picks (except maybe some of the ones with a more softer grippy surface. The attack is precise. I've always favored the triangular picks for the three equal sides to use for picking, in case the pick gets turned around in my hand. It's a short reach to get to another point to use for strumming. If you like thick picks, it's definitely worth trying these guys. I get about fifteen-ish hours out of the picks, on 11-52 stainless steel strings...with a lot of rhythm playing. Good luck!	1
This is an excellent pick for acoustic guitars which I play. Unlike the traditional teardrop style picks that can only be played one way, you can easily play from any of the corners. This makes the pick orientation in your fingers irrelevant and much easier to flip from finger picking to using the pick. I find the .60 pick is a perfect thickness as well. I have tried using .50 picks and while they work very well, the .60 pick feels and sounds a bit more solid.  I would definitely recommend these picks to any player!	1
Perfect!! And a great price! Very happy!!	1
A very solid feeling, genuine strat replacement set. I won't kid you, they are good as top notch replacements made by authorized companies. My worry was getting a genuine product, but they seem to be legit.  The knobs are consistent with the proper white scheme I needed, consistent gold coloring for the numbers and letters and match all my other knobs on the other strats and fit properly on my CTS knobs.	1
Authentic Fender product. As advertised. They look great and work equally as well.	1
Great knobs for factory appearance.	1
just what I wanted, no prodution flaws briliant white tight fit gold accent in layed proper.	1
Item as described	1
Great knobs	1
great knobs, the color is lovely and the fit perfectly. couple of month of gigging they will look vintage 100%	1
Just like the original.  works and fits well.	1
Fits the amp, what else is there?	1
Love it. Just what I needed.	1
I purchased a 1972 Fender VibroChamp tube amp in pristine condition and want to keep it that way so I bought this cover for it.  It's not a perfect fit, it's a bit big, but that's better than being too small so it will work out fine.  The price was right and it will protect this little amp from bumps and dust.  It's nice and sturdy, thick and should last forever. Good value.	1
If you want to keep your gear looking as good as possible - buy this cover. The only thing better would be a road case.	1
Not really much to say here, except to say that if you are wondering if it will absolutely fit your Frontman 25R, it does so perfectly. Reasonably sturdy and well made, it does a nice job of covering the amp.  I recommend it!	1
I bought this microphone just in case my wireless ones crap out (its nice to have a backup). Behringer continues to impress me with their products, I have now built another mobile DJ system using only that brand and I AM IMPRESSED. Not an expensive microphone but comparable to the Shure SM58 at a fraction of the cost. Do the research and you will be pleased.  DJTOM66	1
I ordered two of them and both arrived within a week. I tested both of them, they sound quite good as the majority reviewers said (that's why I bought this !!!). And they are solidly built too, not one of the pretty light microphone that comes in with cheap karaoke machine. I don't expect to come with it, so no cable is OK for me.  Here is the BUT ...... : there is no ON/OFF switch, this really pissed me off. But this is my fault, I should have read the 1 star review first. The photo shows no ON/OFF switch, however this does not catch any attention. And all seller seems to have trouble to say "this product does not have this, does not have that..." It only says what the product does have. Oh well, I got stuck with two microphones without ON/OFF switch. I can buy an adapter with on/off switch for microphone.	-1
Nice	1
These were exactly the knobs my partscaster needed. The tonez just soar with these!! Add some pointer washers (or thumb-cutters) and you can accurately see if your tone is just past 7.3, or all the way on 8. Installation was a breeze, and the guitar just oozes Strat goodness.	1
I bought the white set. They are the standard type you find on basic Fender guitars. I have compared them to some old Squier knobs from the 2000s and these are much nicer. I'm not sure if these come on current Squiers. Best part is they are cheap so there's no point in buying generic.	1
Identical to original.	1
My 50s reissue Strat has 2 brand new black tone knobs and a really old vintage volume knob, which is losing colour. The new volume knob has gold letters/numbers and it looks freaking amazing. It was a pretty good buy and I'm completely happy with the product. If you REALLY take care of your guitar and you want to keep every detail as pretty as possible get brand new knobs ASAP!	1
Great to replace original white with gold trim knobs. Fit knobs well and quality of plastic is very good, but not great.	1
Covers are the missing piece of every Fender amp!  And then they make them hard to find....  This cover is a perfect fit for the GDEC 30.	1
Looks fine with clean edges. I will be using it this weekend.	1
Works Great!!	1
My original nut gave it up and snapped in two. This one was low. Had been hoping to make the switch without all the extra setup that ended up being required.	-1
I ordered this mic based on all the reviews that said it was equilivant to the SM58.  When I connected it to my PA amp all I got was popping noises and handeling noise.  No voice at all.  On top of that, the included clips mounting threads are too small for my On Stage mic stand.  Am returning it and will buy a real Shure mic to replace it.  Update I have since purchased the Samson Q7.  Much better mic.  This one really is as good as the SM58.	-1
This is a terrific value for anyone who wants something like the Shure SM58 but doesn't want to lay out $100. I bought it myself as a kind of experiment. I'm learning blues harp. I wanted to try out mikes that could be used for a combination of vocals and harmonic playing. For this reason, the mike had to be one that I could cup in my hands but also mount on a stand. While my Astatic JT-30 has the great shape and crunchy sound that harp players love, I can't (easily) mount it on a stand and use it for vocals.  The spherical receiver makes the XM8500 pretty easy to cup in my hands. The torpedo body mounts easily on my OnStage boom mike stand. And the low-impedance output feeds nicely into my guitar amps with no need for preamping or impedance-matching (and no resulting noise or signal loss).  The mike isn't perfect, but its low cost and generally excellent construction more than make up for the slight deficiencies. Here are a couple of more casual notes:  1. The mike in the picture looked bluish to me. What I actually received was a mike with a very nice black finish.  2. The product description seems to report a weight of 8.5 ounces. I measured this mike at 10.3 ounces. That gives it a substantial feel although the mike is still a bit lighter than similar dynamic mikes that I've used.  3. The mike has 500 ohms impedance and a frequency response up to 16,000 Hz. Bluesmen prefer a cut-off at 10,000 to give a midrange boost, but tweaking can compensate for the extended range on this mike.  4. The mike doesn't have an on-off switch, perhaps its  only real deficiency. These switches really are very handy.  5. In actual use, the mike dosn't seem very susceptible to pops, and there is no hiss.  6. The mike comes with a pretty substantial hard-shell carrying case with a molded foam interior that is more than enough protection. I find a smaller zippered case to be more convenient for pacing this mike in a suitcase, but if you are toting a fair amount of equipment around, or storing this at home, then the oversized case should work well.  I hope this helps.	1
This is a great mic. I have a few of these and they all work great and get the job done very well. Everyone talks down about Behringer products but i think everything they do is pretty good. This is a great mic and u definetly cant beat the price. I recommend this mic to every sound tech!!!!! Great job Behringer!!!!	1
I primarily use this for vocal recording for musical composition. Overall, this mic has been great, and catches just the right amount of my voice without any external interference. I sometimes have a fan going on low speed about 5 feet away from me, and it doesn't interfere, even while blowing on me. To be fair, I have a foam windscreen on the mic itself. I can recommend this to fellow musicians for a home studio. I am sure it may not be as good as some of the higher end brands/models, but this one works for me.

I'm a musician and i'm working on a home studio right now so naturally i've been buying lots of equipment lately and this was one of them, though what the hell i'll give it a shot, its cheap and it looks legit. This mic is amazing!! Its sturdy and very well made, plus it comes in an awesome case and the sound is fantastic! I would buy this if you're a musician on a budget, or even if you're not on a budget, its a great mic.	1
I have been playing and singing off and on for close to 20 years and currently host an open mic at a local coffee shop. I have used lots of great equipment and mics including the oft mentioned sm57 and sm58. While I did not have either one of those to do an a/b comparison - I DID have 2 high-end (over $100 mics) to compare these too. One was an EV and the other a rather costly older Peavey. These mics compared favorably to both with a slighter flatter frequency response. The signal was not quite as hot as the EV and Peavey, but far more resistant to feedback - even when turned up to match the hotter volumes of the other 2. Can't speak to their longevity or reliability yet, but seems sturdy and a nice performing piece of musical equipment. I feel that these mics will compare favorably to anything under 150 bucks. Great value & highly recommended.	1
I was skeptical of these microphones because of the low price, so I bought one to try it out.  I have to admit they sound fairly close to a Shure SM58. It is not identical, but I believe some people when they say they prefer this mic with their voice - the frequency response is a bit different and the XM8500 has a bit higher gain.  The microphone is a tad lighter in the handle than a SM58(making it balanced a bit more heavily on the grill side), but still feels very durable.  This mic is near the quality and performance of an SM58, and at $22 I am just amazed.  I am buying a few more, for live sound I can't see the reason to pay more for an SM58.	1
I mainly use this for vocals through a Motu unit into my computer.  Thus far it has worked great.  Like many others have said, this is a very solid feeling microphone. It also comes in its own nice little case, which makes it easy to move around and store safely.	1
What is there to say....Fender parts for Fender guitars; can't go wrong if one wants to keep the guitar stock.	1
Look no further. This is the second set I have purchased. Yes Im cheap. I've tried aging them myself to dismal results. Break out the five to seven dollars and buy these. Perfect aged color. Not over done.	1
It didn't take too long for it to arrive.  It is exactly as I expected the product to be. Would recommend this to my friends.	1
Dimarzio white isn't the same as Fender white, but it's also different than Parchment. Easiest solution for some Dimarzio white pickups I'd ordered and wanted to try out, was to get the parts together to pre-wire a pickguard and this is part of that. They are as described.	1
I used these knobs on a guitar which is about 10 years old, whose white pickguard had noticeably yellowed and was missing all but one knob.  I won't give this 5 stars because the color does not match the type of yellowing that actually happens to white plastic, but they fit well nonetheless and my client was happy enough with the result.  I have no doubt that these would match a "vintaged" pickguard color, so it should be a safe move to combine them with a new "vintaged" pickguard.	1
I used these to build a new loaded pickguard for my strat. They fit the pots perfectly and look good too.	1
These knobs are great and have the vintage look I was looking for. You need to also replace the selector knob and have the right pick up covers for these to work. I believe most people would want the whole kit.	1
It has its own case and inside of the case is a hold witch you can attach to a mic stand of your choice, would def get another one. Only problem is no on/off switch.	1
when you buy a 2 USD mic all you can think is, i'll have to buy another in about 2 or 3 months but this mic is really awesome, it starts with a great package protection, and its like a profesisional 20 USD mic	1
First of all this is NOT the best microphone ever made.  But for what they cost they certainly are more than I expected.  I give it 4 stars as a microphone period, without even taking the low cost into consideration.  They are so much better than the next cheapest thing that they are worth the extra $5 for sure. I bought one Behringer XM8500 then two more a couple of months later planning to use them as rehearsal microphones for a geezer band start up about 5 years go.  However, we actually have used these for vocals at some live performances when the sound tech's personal SM-58's are busy at another job.  I honestly think we sound about the same either way and maybe a little clearer with the Behringers.  At one time Alice Cooper and his band were using the Behringer XM8500's, however they may have moved on now for all I know.  These are not Shure SM-58 clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs.  They have a slightly hotter output and a more flat response to my ears while the Shure's have a more pronounced lower mid boost that makes the male voice sound bigger and sometimes more distorted if not eq'ed correctly.  They are an ideal backup vocal microphone since the Behringer behaves like a compromise between a microphone tailored for a male voice and a microphone tailored for a female voice and actually works well without heavy eq.  It also is if anything more versatile than the SM-58 as it can be useful as an acoustic instrument pickup microphone working for anything that you would ordinarily use an SM-57 to pick up.  It doesn't overload easily, has a high output and a tight pattern with about the same feedback rejection as the SM-58.  It has a reasonably decent blast filter, so if using it for outdoor instrument pickup you don't have to add a windscreen.  Another strength of these is durability.  My 3 have sustained numerous drops, a couple of falls happened while boom stand mounted so not only did the microphone fall but the weight of the boom stand was behind it adding more mass to the force of the fall.  No damage at all to any of them!  I used to cringe when they fell or got dropped but now I just shrug. One weak point about these is they are more sensitive to handling noise, but on the stand handling noise is no issue.  Mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters.  The stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable. If you want SM-58's you need to buy SM-58's.  If you want a good all around microphone in the $20 to $40 class then try one of these.  No on-off switch on these but we do have switches on some of the SM-58's we use and frankly the on-off switch is a liability!  I don't think you can find a better microphone new for the money and recommend them as a decent all-around microphone for the price.  You can pay more and get less.	1
Good microphone for the money, sounds a little better than my AKG D88S, knocked it down to 4 stars due to the fact it does not have an on/off switch. I am a user of Behringer products though, own 2 of their amps.	1
I am a professional touring and recording artist, OMEB, who typically sings through a beta 58. I have recently been very impressed with some of Behringer's products. Sometimes I will run sound for local festivals and needed a few extra vocal mics. I had read a few good reviews of this and decided to buy one. At $25 I figured I could chance it! I used this in place of my beta 58 at a recent show. The mic was much hotter than the 58, better bass response and the boosted highs in all the right frequencies! As far as durability... that is the question, but if you are looking for a great mic that doesn't cost $160 bucks... this is your mic!	1
This is a high quality microphone. Sounds really clear and noise is nonexistent. Works great with my new mixer. Built very sturdy with metal and not plastic. Shipping was great along with packaging. This is a very nice dynamic mic!	1
Picked up a pair of these 2 years ago as cheap spare mics.  Found they are indistinguishable from an SM58 to both singers and the audience!  Running the board I know it's different because it's a little hotter and a little brighter.  I see that as improvements over the SM58 which is lacking in both.  The only downside compared to the SM58 is slightly more handling noise (which you won't notice with the mic in a stand) and the black versus silver ball filter.	1
I was expecting a so-so mike for the price, boy was I surprised!  This mike is great.  One thing I did notice was that if it wasn't fed into a mixer you need some low impedance filters to keep the thing from buzzing, other than that it works great.	1
wow wow I can't believe it working wonderful. I'm using it karaoke online in paltalk. I did compairation with somes I have, it's perfect vocal. I connected it with mixer Alesis 8 input. I wish it's built with switch on/off Recomend to buyer. Thanks Amazon	1
I think my biggest letdown was no Fender engraving on this one, but not a deal breaker. The plate is thick, which is obviously important. Plating is good, and holes are properly beveled and not too small. This allows them to accomodate different variations of screws, as I don't think this plate comes with them.  My only issue probably has nothing to do with the plate but the body they are currently on, with the neck currently being used. The current screw holes seem to be too narrowly spaced in width (not length). This is a little odd, since the body seems to be cut for a slightly wider neck. But since the body is aftermarket and all this stuff varies and is a bit of a gamble until you measure everything, I can't really criticize the plate at all.	1
Very good fret wire. Did the job nicely. I would recommend these to any luthier out there, who wants to take some of the pain out of a fret job.	1
OK, there's nothing wrong with these fret wires. But I do feel the need to let people know that if you're NOT a professional and for some reason get it into your head that just because you've installed locking tuners on your guitar and watched a bunch of youtube videos you're now thinking to yourself "Yeah I can replace the three worn out frets on this thing," that I hope you're doing it on a guitar you don't mind wrecking.  I got it done, and from a distance you can't even tell the difference, but it is NOT an easy or simple tasks. If you don't have a fret press SPECIFICALLY MADE to get frets into the fingerboard, getting them in is NOT going to be easy (I improvised one out of a vice-grip, some rubber strips and a bunch of foam).  If you're not a VERY handy person who has done this kind of thing before, and you care about your guitar, have a professional do this.	1
These fret's were perfect for my squite strat. They fit great,  fileing takes a little time,  but that's to be expected. Great fret's thogh.	1
It arrived right on time. It fit my guitar perfectly! #10/32 threads size	1
Works well.	1
It fits perfectly in my MIM Strat and includes two tremolo bar tips, white and white vintage.	1
Good.	1
Just a fender whammy bar. No more, no less. But do yourself a favor and get yourself a Fender tremolo spring (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KZIKU/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) if you don't have one already. Makes all the difference in the world. No arm-jiggle, they protect the guitar wood, and the arm stays in any position you want without over-tightening.  It should be noted that the tips are not the threaded type. So instead of screwing on the tips, you press them into place. Im not sure if that is a quality of any Strat period or place of manufacture.	1
I was so excited. It came super fast but it didn't fit my stray :(	-1
Looks just like my original Tremelo arm, good quality.	1
Fits my 1991 Fender American Standard Stratocaster. Came with a vintage white and bright white plastic tip that you can switch out.	1
Perfect fit.  Works as it should.  Great price.	1
Fits in Mexican Strat Tremelo Bridge. Drives the wife crazy. Great purchase!	1
Perfect fit for a whammy bar that was missing from the used Strat I bought.	1
Fits Steel treem	1
Perfect. Fits like stock	1
A whammy bar.  A rock and roll star.  Yeah, baby.	1
Really nice bar made of stainless steel and matched up perfectly.	1
This fit my 1999 American Standard Strat perfectly. I originally bought another brand after reading a review that this arm would not fit the two post bridge - that arm did not fit. I'm attaching a photo to help other buyers who might also be misled or confused.	1
Great Fender replacement 10/32 threads, the biggest thing to look for in this stuff is the slightest differences, a 1/16 of an inch means everything, as does metric thread to standard thread. Be careful, and be creative. All can be fixed !	1
My original got bent at the threads and was difficult to use - don't know why I didn't replace it years ago, but glad I finally did.  Works perfectly.  As for the size, I have several strats and they have different trem arms so you need to check your existing arm to get the right size/type.	1
Fits my Strat just fine. It is the narrower thread. This will not fit Samick guitars, that one takes the thicker thread. Be sure you know what you ordering.	1
as advertised, great value	1
The pick guard has 8 holes (instead of 11 found in 3-ply ones) and in different positions. Works perfectly with CTS pots and fender switch. The volume knob hole is positioned a bit farther from the pickup screw hole, so the knob skirt won't scratch against the screw head (it happens in some modern pickguards. Some people buy flatter screws or keep the knob high in the shaft, both solutions inelegant). This alone made me happy. The plastic is a little softer than expected. Buy genuine, it pays up by being compatible, easy to install and good looking. Even the control shield plate fitted perfectly.	1
Fits well.  Looks good.  Used it on a Squier Classic Vibe 50s Strat.  One hole was off a bit, but that's due to the difference between USA/Mexican vs. Asian made strats.  Worked out fine for me.  Note: There is no foil backing on this model.  So, pick up some 3M copper foil tape and apply it to the back before assembling to cut down on hum.	1
I purchased this Fender American Standard Strat Tremelo Arm recently and all I can say is, it works. Perfect fit, nice finish,	1
does what it supposed to do.  What did you expect, its a piece of metal?  wish it had a black plastic end.  I think Fender over inflates the prices.  Wait OF COURSE THEY DO. its fender	1
Arm is not at the same quality Fender made 10 years ago, cheaper, thinner and less durable, suggest trying to find a version prior to 1996, or at least one produced in USA,	-1
I bought a used Fender Stratocaster with no bar for the tremolo. This bar screwed right in and works like a champ.	1
Basic Fender pot...decent price  originally equiptment .......dont overexpose to soldering iron heat when soldering ground to shield case nothing more to say the standard pot replacement	1
These are some of my favorite pots as a luthier. They last for a long time, they have great tolerance and they can be modified to nearly any spec you want. I love that they come with a capacitor, even though I only use these type on lower end guitars, because I generally only use Sprague Orange Drops,  It just adds to the great price. The best part was the very fast delivery, because I came into a crisis where I needed them soon, and they arrived before I expected.	1
I used this to replace a Pot in my MIM Telecaster. Works great. I didn't notice any change in tone. It just worked like the old one. But the main this is that it worked. And my Tele sounds as great as it always did.	1
Excellent Pots!	1
I was a little disappointed.  Don't know if it's a QC problem or if I just got some rejects but out of 6 pots, 1 was out of spec (315k) and 2 were almost out (289k, 205k).  1 was right on the money and the other 2 were within 10%.  They are CTL's so I'm a bit confused.  Other than that they work fine, they have the nut, washer and cap included (no knob).  I will be upgrading the caps.	-1
Hi, I thought these pots would come without the proper caps, it`s not on the description of the product, and they did, so I'm pleased by it, have not installed them yet... they are CTS brand, it`s hard to read what uF are the caps, I think they are 0.022uF the standard for Fender guitars	1
Young musicians drool over the guitars of the fifties. Well, so do we older ones -- but we do it with fond memories; with fingers, eyes and ears that remember the glory of those instruments and what they meant in our lives.  I, for instance have been playing guitar since about 1962.  Back then if a new guitar was too expensive for a young player we'd look for something a few years old -- and that brought us back into the fifties.  How many of us kick ourselves for selling that special first "good" guitar -- looking to trade up to something new?  How many of us dream of getting our hands on such an instrument again today?  Well now we can!  Thank you Fender!  The Classic Series `50s Stratocaster is the real thing.  Doubt that?  Just put one in the hands of an old rocker like me!  Seeing one and playing one for the first time, in my case a brand spankin' new, just out of the showroom, just out of the case, `50s Stratocaster in Surf Green was like getting into Mr. Well's time machine.  I plugged her into an early `60s Tremolux, turned on the power and... and... wailed.  This is the real thing.  The fingerboard tells me so. The bright, sparkling, tones told me so.  So did the buzz and hum. Off with those danged curlycue florescent lights. (If God meant us to use those things he wouldn't have invented Thomas Edison)  In truth a Classic Series `50s Strat is not for everyone.  Higher gain PUs were invented for a purpose. So were larger radius finger boards and more advanced two pivot-point floating vibratos.  But if you want to be able to create the sound and vibes of early rock -- the music of Buddy Holly for instance,, or of any number of surf bands, this is the way to go.  Just keep down the gain and enjoy the sparkle.  I can't speak highly enough of the Classic Series `50s Stratocaster.  The feel, the finish, the sound, the quality -- all are there. To the point of perfection.  Yes, thank you Fender!  You've done it again. Leo would be proud.	1
I felt like a kid on Christmas, seeing this guitar out of the packaging and on my guitar stand. Fender really got it right with this one, and the attention to detail is amazing. My guitar was set up with a nice low action right out of the box, and was almost in tune, which tells me it hasn't been subjected to much throwing around or storage here and there.  After a quick tune, I went through a few chord progressions and scales, and didn't encounter any fret buzzing or dulls spots. The daphne blue finish isn't as dark as the picture you see here on Amazon, so you might want to check out some pictures on Google to get an average estimation on color. I'm actually cool with the lighter tone of blue, as it looks even more vintage and makes the neck stand out more prominently.  Overall, just a gorgeous guitar that should definitely be a part of your collection.	1
This guitar is beautiful, plays like a dream come true, sounds great and is really comfortable to play standing up or sitting down. Ideal, like all Stratocasters, for fingerpicking too. I have a Les Paul I have had for years, a Telecaster from the 1970s, finally I have selected my Strat and it is my favorite electric, by far. I love the surf green, really nice and exactly what I have been flirting with for years. When I recently saw Stephen Stills with a green stratocaster on stage, that did it, I made my selection! I feel like this is a lot of guitar for the money, and it came set up perfectly! Fender's Mexico factory is really putting out some good, good quality stuff and I love the way it was set up! This green is awesome, and if you like green like I do, get it!! Sounds and looks very much like a late 1950s Strat! I went out on a limb and decided to go for the slick maple neck and fingerboard, over the years I have been a rosewood/ebony fingerboard man, and, I must admit I really like slick maple, very comfortable! The review says Sunburst, but what I have is the surf green! I love the surf green color!!!!!	1
If you're looking for a guitar that gives you that great '50's sound, this is the one! The only adjustment I made was raising the back two pickups to match the factory specs, other than that, nothing! Great looking guitar also, I got the daphne blue and love it, the color is a good bit lighter than the picture though. Such a comfortable guitar to play, is light and the contoured body is awesome and lays against me like a glove. I've always played Telecasters and have 3 of them and love them, always wanted a Strat that I could get that old time twang out of and this one is it! The neck and the slick finish are great, fingers easy and the bending potential is incredible! Super quality here also, I can't find anything wrong anywhere on this guitar and believe me, I go over them with a fine toothed comb! Tremolo bar is sick, love it and the look is great, works like it should, never messing up the tuning. I could go on and on but I will just say that, for the money, you can go wrong here,	1
Works great	1
Great replacement, excellent quality.	1
The resistance was a little low, just under 200K ohms, but I ended up mod'ing it to be no-load pot, so it didn't matter.  It comes with mounting hardware and a tone capacitor.  Bonus!	1
These are great - however keep in mind these will only work for front-routed guitars. The threads are not long enough for any rear-routed guitars.	1
Good quality, good price.	1
Good quality part.	1
good	1
Has worked very well for about 2 years and counting.	1
EXCELLENT PRODUCT	1
Completely Satisfied!	1
CTS/Fender, a nice good quality pot.  Also really awesome that it comes with the capacitor in case you're using it for a tone knob, and all the screws/washers/etc you'll need.  Many of the cheap-o pots leave off the nuts/washers, and virtually none come with the capacitors.	1
Good replacement for the price.	1
Works just like it's supposed to. I'd buy it again.	1
True OEM	1
Perfect for my guitars. Sounds great for my telecaster and my Stratocaster guitars. Capacitor are a nice generalized  choice. Excellent choice.	1
Works fine for my guitar. Beats listening to that noisy pot that was in my guitar. Easy to install and plays like new again.	1
250K is a round-a-bout number in this world. Beware the +/- of the GD&T.  Otherwise, expected variability aside, nice job with the 263K Splitshaft Potentiometer, Fender.	1
I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE QUALITY OF THIS PRODUCT. INSTALLED VERY EASY WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED IN THE KIT.	1
I used this to replace the mini pot that came with my son's Squier Mini Strat. The old pot was scratchy, turning free and worked more of an ON/OFF switch. The replacement is smooth, scratch free and was easy to install.  Great value, if I need 250k pots again, I'm definitely buying these again	1
My American Fender Stratocaster Deluxe HSS came with a tiny Fender microfiber towel to use when wiping it down.  I loved this little towel.  It doesn't scratch the finish, yet it cleans well.  The problem is, the one that came with the guitar is only a little sample towel.  I already knew the towel worked well, so I bought a normal-sized one.  It has not disappointed.  It is a large guitar towel that still fits inside the guitar case.  It doesn't scratch and works flawlessly.	1
I changed the pots on my Squier Strat from the cheap pots that were on there and this thing is definitely an OEM fender part. Can't go wrong with this!	1
I bought this to replace a recently busted (generic) volume pot. It works like a champ. I'm a stickler for genuine OEM parts so I typically by Fender only.	1
Quality, years of trouble free service, no static when you turn your knobs, there's nothing more aggrevating than a static pot	1
Used this to replace a dead volume pot in an older Strat-type guitar, and it sounds great!  The diameter of the threaded portion was a little larger than the original, Chinese pot, so I needed a cheap reamer (purchased through Amazon) to enlarge the pickguard hole.  It's a nice, smooth pot with no scratchiness.  nice big lugs to solder to.	1
Ordered 6, and out of 6, I have exactly zero flat washers. Doesn't match the picture. Caps are marked 223K, so, looking that up, they are 0.022uf. Pot, lockwasher, nut, and cap are what is included.	1
I upgraded all electronics inside a partscaster strat.  The original pots sounded a little scratchy which I probably could've fixed with a spritz of that potentiometer cleaner spray, but I was in the mood to yank all the parts.  I bought 2 of these pots and they came with 0.022uF capacitors for the tone set-up which I thought was nice (even though I used 0.047uF caps from Radio Shack for a tad more bass sound).	1
These were purchased for my parts bin.  They fit, they work, they are quiet and they won't make your life miserable.  That's all I want from replacment parts.	1
Al ser el producto fender original se ve que es robusto.. y con una buen duravilidad.. hoy lo instalare.. Saludos desde Venezuela!!	1
It's a great pot, nice sound and give to my strat a most. I recommand this ti anyone that want have great sound.	1
Good upgrade for my Squier Deluxe Strat. Although, note that if your pickguard isn't a Fender made brand, the hole in the pickguard maybe a little small. Not to worry. All I did was took a drill bit the same size as the "screw" (where the knob goes on, and drilled the pickguard, thus it fitting. Over all nice purchase.	1
Comes with a capacitor, so that's a bonus.  These pots are CTS and have a nice tight feel compared to Alpha pots.  Alpha are a little cheaper, have basically the same tolerance, are slightly looser in feel as you turn, and get the job done pretty much the same.  What it really boils down to is whether you prefer a slightly tighter feel, or a slightly looser turning knob.	1
I've never had one of these pots fail on me. Never had one go scratchy. I'm sure they will, as most pots will, but I've either been fortunate or these are very well made pots.	1
This pedal is superb value for money. You get a wide range of digital modelled amp tones of which a handful are truly excellent. The Brit high gain amp has the classic Marshall fat bottom end and slightly compressed upper mid range. The noise gate and compressor are both great, and both can be used in combination with amp models and an additional effect. The modulation and delay effects are as good as Line6 equivalents, and to my ears, some of the dynamic overdriven amp models are marginally more responsive than Line6.  I use this pedal in 'A1' configuration going into the effects return input of a 1x12 combo and it sounds great. The sheer versatility of tones you can get belies its price.  Couple of gripes: there is a 100ms delay/silence when changing presets. This is really annoying if you are kicking in a big sound for a solo and your first note gets cut off. The expression pedal is pretty cheesy feeling. If either of this is a deal breaker I'd consider getting the v-amp 3 and FCB1010 foot board instead. I mainly use this pedal as a rehearsal tool.  Here is how to recalibrate the expression pedal if you find it's not working across its full range: Remove the power supply plug from the X-V-Amp, and make sure that the X-V-Amp is placed on a stable surface. Look underneath the ends of the pedal to check that the rubber pads are seated properly. Start the calibration with the pedal fully open. Press and hold the keys "Delay" and "Reverb" together. Keep these two keys held down and reconnect the power supply plug. On start up, the display will show "PU" - which means "Pedal upper" Gently move the pedal fully forward (closed) until it reaches the end of its travel. The display will now read "PL". Caution - there is no need to apply too much pressure !! Gently move the pedal backwards (open) until the rubber pad rests against the casing. The display will now show "PU" (pedal upper). To confirm the calibration and return to the normal operating menu, either (a) Press and hold the keys "Delay" and "Reverb" together, or (if this has no effect) (b) activate the pedal switch (press down hard on the end of the pedal). The unit will re-initialise itself, but the original settings will not be overwritten.	1
Very good tool for the money.	1
I bought this to use in my studio and had bought another cable in order to port the output into my rack.  I bought a Hosa Cable STX105F 1/4 TRS to XLR3 Female Cable - 5 Foot to connect the unit.  Rock on	1
Makes changing guitar strings a lot easier. Well constructed and light. Fits in the accessories case in my guitar case.	1
...I mean in the hands you 'feel it' weak. But honestly it is still here and full... (more to add maybe)  I WANT TO CHOOSE THE COLOR!!! Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr	1
Showing the original list price as $68 is terribly misleading. That has to be the price of a multi-pack of cranks. The crank is worth what I paid for it but it's just one crank.	-1
The effects are pretty good, lots of choices and possibilities. The only downside is that you always have to go up and down the numbers to get to a specific effect. I know you can program it, but I would prefer to be able to jump to an effect without having to program it according to your (changing) favorites.	1
This lil unit is amzing and is just perfect for he beginner player or even pros can ue it. Has great effects!	1
I'm a fan of behringer, this is no exception.  It's nice. YouTube it? I like it does so much and no batteries, I'd say 5 stars but its got 2 things, 1st it's complicated. And 2nd it's plastic housed.   Which is that it's not a beat on, pedal included, I only use hand power to work this, that being said. It's great for modeling, I use for an older amp with no model board effects, it fills in great. Great starter for those tweaking sound...	1
Great little String Winder, except that it's black and everything is black encluding the guitar!  I lose everything that's black, so I break out the pink fingernail polish and jazz it up, that works...  It winder is strong plastic and the hook on the end is excellent to get the pens out.  Can't do without this!	1
DISCLAIMER: I'm an amateur guitar player, not a road warrior. I've used this winder to replace the full string set about 10 times so far and my opinion below is based on that experience.  It grabs the "head" easily and firmly and you can crank it quite fast without bumping on the adjacent ones, even when they're quite cramped like in a Strato. I have a Squier that has them even closer to each other and I have no problems.  On the personal side, I used to take months to replace the string set after one broke just for the laziness and the sweating of manually crank all 6. Now I replace the strings immediately and have the guitar ready.	1
haven't had a chance to use it yet but i am sure it will work well. got to be better than turning tuners by hand.	1
Cheap and works great at accelerating spinning on a new set of strings.  The built in pin puller feature is only so-so, because of flimsy construction, but was able to pull four out of six pins.  Overall I like it and giving 5-stars!  Yes, I would recommend it or buy another if I needed it.  Follow-up on 5/13/2013: I've used this tool to install about 10-sets of strings and it has been working great.  Another plus is that the 'head' that grabs the tuner knob is small so it does not hit the adjacent tuner while spinning.	1
What more can I say, it's a cover!  Fits, hopefully will protect from dust and junk getting on the amp.  IT did have to be aired out as it had that terrible plastic smell.	1
In my over 40 years of guitar playing I have always used Fender amps.  They seem to last forever especially when a cover is used.  This cover does a great job of protecting my amp from spills, stains, dust, etc.  No Fender amp should be without this beauty.	1
I love this pickguard, looks so cool on my red Telecaster, matches all the other chrome hardware, made of metal and does NOT scratch! Every one that sees my Telecaster loves it! Thanks! Good price also, saw several other sellers with this product, this seller had the best price by far! Packaged VERY well and delivered in a timely manner!	1
Not sure what can be said about these, except that when you lose one it is *really* nice to have a box of them in your kit.  As with screwdrivers and ball point pens, once you have enough of them around the problem of losing one becomes much less serious.  - J	1
great, pure Fender.	1
Purchased the 5-hole pickguard in eggshell for my MIM Baja Telecaster. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much since I hated the cheap, white plastic version that came stock. Black Bakelite looked good, gold anodized aluminum looked better, but somehow this one just seems right. It's a heavy, vintage thickness, rigid, and very high quality. The eggshell color adds just enough warmth as well. There is no shielding so you may want to slap some copper foil on the back.  Note that this is NOT for Squiers that are made in Japan. Should fit all USA and most MIM models.	1
Everything ok.	1
Perfect fit and exactly what I wanted	1
I purchased this for my Squier Telecaster, took very little fitting to make it work perfect. I purchased the Tele from Amazon also, after many reviews I realized the only string thru Squier was offered in the Tele package they sell. I bought it for the body, replaced all the electronic's, pickups, pots, switch, plug. I now have a great sounding and looking Telecaster. For 1/4 the price of a pure Fender Tele. Couldn't be more pleaded with both Amazon and Fender products.	1
good pickguard.  i wish they made a fender mustang pickguard for humbucker configuration	1
it fits	1
nice	1
very light mint color but it looks really nice against my black Tele	1
Great price on a high-quality polishing cloth. Not much else to say about it - it polishes my guitar very nicely.	1
use the cloth often to polish my guitar. The fender logo makes it look legit.  Recommended to one and all.	1
Item arrived as described and on time - Way larger than expected, but my son loved it!  Says it's easier to use than the smaller cloths we've gotten before.	1
This is a nice soft cloth that is perfect to use with the Fender polish. It is great for the finished body and even does well on the metal pieces like the saddles and bridge. It leaves no streaks when polishing and lasts for many polishings.  There is nothing on the packaging to indicate where the cloth is made, if that matters to you.	1
This is my second Fender Polish Cloth. They are basic, but that's all I need for a quick wipe down of my instrument after I'm done playing. The only slight negative is the fact that they tend to unravel around the edges. Even though this has happened to me, it didn't keep me from buying the second one. The fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me. It gets softer with time and use. Overall I have to say that I'm satisfied with the Fender Polish Cloth.	1
Had this installed by my friends at Guitar Center in Austin, TX and I love the look.  Very happy with this purchase.	1
These really hold the tremolo arm in place - simple string tension works wonders.	1
steadied my trem arm	1
Dresses up telecaster versus the plain white original pick guard	1
Great deal!	1
Fit well. Looks terrific.	1
Did not fit a project Squier Bullet Tele. Would never have been a good look with the amount of trimming I would have needed to do. Not one screw lined up with the old PG. I would have needed a router to keep it acceptable and then drill 8 new holes. No thanks.  It was beautiful, though. Definitely a vintage feel. Little more yellow than in the picture. Just what we wanted.	-1
Nice  classic fender part,great price!	1
Is your tremolo dangling down to where you have to reach way down to grab it? You're probably missing this little spring that goes into the tremolo hole just before you screw in the tremolo arm. Stevie would have had one, eventually. After years of letting that thang dangle loosely, he was about to scream!	1
Works well in my MIJ Strat as well as in various Squiers.  I only wish you could buy fewer at a time.	1
These springs work perfect for an American Stratocaster. I am not a nerd for name brand parts, however, in this case, third party, off brand springs have never worked for me. They are always too short, too long, or too big in diameter.	1
TIGHTENED UP THAT SLOPPY ARM  !!!!!!!!	1
Perfect fit. Cut right, drilled perfectly. Looks fantastic on my custom tele.	1
If you need a 5 screw vintage pickguard, this is the one. I'm using it on a 57 tele partscaster and it looks and fits fantastic. Note that it's a one ply which is consistent with 1950's Telecasters.  This is an excellent product.	1
It fits. Shipping was extremely fast from kmc music. Price was right. It's a fender. No issues at all with this.	1
The trem arm gets fixed!	1
Got a used guitar and it was missing the tremolo spring. Without the spring it just falls down. With the spring it stays where you leave it.	1
It was hard to see in the picture so i kindof kept my fingers crossed but when it came in it was evertitying it said it was. I planned on putting it on my classic vibe telecaster and it fit perfectly. It was the only white pickguard i could find with the 5-hole design. Originally i had a black pickguard on my vintage blonde telecaster (as manufactured) and it looks cool and all but the guitar had a more vintage vibe with the white on blonde color scheme. I still keep my old pickguard in case i change my mind but its been a couple months and i have yet to do so. Very satisfied with the product:)	1
Not much to say here, besides this is a Genuine Fender product, and very well made. The price might seem a little high for a pickguard, but it's worth it!	1
To me, guitars are kinda like Harley's, you gotta dress it up to make it your own. I bought a Sparrow Twangmaster tele clone from Canada. It has a killer, hand-painted hot rod flame paint job. The chrome pickguard adds to the hot-rod vibe. I figure if I'm gonna make the audience deaf, the chrome might as well blind them too! The holes did not line up perfectly. I had to drill one more hole that didn't match up perfectly. No problem, I don't imagine I'll ever remove it and I can't imagine selling the guitar either.	1
This pick guard really added pazazz.... to my old Tele. I'm very happy with the fit and the quality of this pick guard. This wa a great buy at a great price.	1
Upgrade your "plain white" Tele pickguard with this reasonably priced genuine Fender replacement part. Gives it a classic look!  No new holes to be drilled, fits perfectly.  Good quality and fast shipping.	1
A true Fender pick guard this inexpensive. One thing to remember is you must drill the Neck pup mounting screw holes yourself. No big deal though.	1
This is a nice pickguard.  Standard b/w/b pickguard.  This is Fender quality, so you should already know what to expect.	1
Perfect fit and function.	1
Good springs, they work!	1
These are really great. I was getting some wobble in my trem arm where there was dead space between up and down and the arm wouldn't stay put. Dropped one of the springs from this pack and there and the wobble is gone. Now my trem arm stays in place and there's no play between trying to bend up or down.  Only reason it's not 5 stars is that after you screw your trem arm in you kind of have to keep it at whatever level the spring allows or you have to cut it down. It's not a big deal though. They give you enough springs that you could play around with it if you wanted.	1
These really work, totally stabilized the floppy trem arm on my Strat. Now I can use the trem as intended. I have used cotton in the past but these are much more effective. Highly recommended!  EDIT: Be careful not to tighten much beyond the point you initially feel the pressure of the spring, one of them got stuck in my trem block after it eventually lost its elasticity, and was very difficult to remove (used a toothpick as a "screw" and eventually pulled it out). Use with care!	1
I bought 3 different SX Strat copy guitars and took a change that this spring upgrade for the tremolo arm to get rid of the loose movement of the arm. They worked like a charm even though not real fender strats. You might want cut the spring a few turns to get the right depth and angle of the arm, as those who have Fenders from Mexico have to do.	1
These do not work on a 2001 Mexican. They fall right thru the tremelo hole because there is nothing to stop them.	-1
just what I needed...	1
Used on a Fender Shawbucker Strat and had to cut the spring to about 3/4" the size so it would fit. When trying to use it without cutting it would not let the bar far enough into the bridge to catch the threads and screw in.	1
If you have a strat and actually use the whammy bar then these are a must. I am a very detail oriented person and I don't know what I would do with out these.	1
Fits in my Jimi Hendrix (Mexican made). As well as my 20th edition Squier. It helps not having to screw in the Tremolo arm 30 times just to get it somewhat snug. Also, when you go to use the Tremolo arm I've noticed that it takes less effort to press down on. Might as well try and see if it fits yours!	1
Fits like a glove...if you have a '65 you owe it to yourself to cover it... I use it whenever I move my favorite amp!	1
What to say?  It does it's job... covers my amp and protects it from dust and spills.  I think that about covers it.	1
Seriously, the guy I bought my second-hand Fender DRRI from did not have this cover.  I wish he did, because the amp was banged up (but has some cool mojo, I admit).  So, I bought this. Immediately. It fits right, that's all you need to know.  Also, the price through Amazon was the lowest I found.	1
Fit the tremolo system exactly.  Easy to install.	1
More than I'll ever need, but then again they're small and easily lost	1
I had no idea that these even existed.  Has made my strat style guitars' tremolo units much more manageable and cut down on the noise they generate by the swinging bar.	1
Great product. It makes my fender and squire temolos work as they should.	1
You may not even realize you need a new one, but keep them on hand and you will notice the difference.	1
Product is exactly as I expected. I use a Mexican made strat and a custom guitar with a strat style bridge and these springs have helped firm up the tremolo arm. I would have liked to be able to buy a smaller pack, but if you need these for a repair then these are great. I have not had any issues where the spring gets stuck in the bridge. However, the difference between spring and no spring is very subtle and may not be necessary for most guitar players.	1
I need these, Fender American Series Stratocaster Tremolo Arm Tension Springs, to slow the swing of the whammy bar on my Strat Clone I built and even though the Fender American Series Stratocaster Tremolo Bridge Assembly  should have had one.  I have a lot of extras now, but the price was reasonable.	1
I bought these for my Fender Stratocaster AS, fits perfectly and I have plenty of spares because I know I will lose a few.	1
Springs for my Fender whammy bars. Makes a huge difference.	1
Works exactly as it should.  I've had my strat for 15 years and didn't know it was supposed to have this part until I watched the video from Phillip McKnight.  I always left the tem bar off because of how loose it was.  Now I leave it on.	1
Based on the pictures and description on this cover, you cannot really get a real idea of how this cover is. I read as much reviews as I could, before buying this cover and even went on Google to try and get more pictures and info, but there was not much I could find. I decided to go ahead a buy this cover, because there were not many or at all of other options out there. I received the cover and it arrived with am approximate 2.5 inches cut on it. I did not bother in making a big deal and demanding it to be replaced, since I live in Costa Rica, Central America, so it would be too much of a hassle to return it and even if I did not have to return it, I will still have to pay a price to receive it in Miami, Florida and forward it to Costa Rica. So I took care of it and the end result was great. I grabbed a piece of PVC black electric tape and put some Elmer's polyurethane glue which is like bullet proof and pasted it on the inside and the cut was gone! So this is a very simple cover, meaning is not padded or thick to kind of prevent the amp from digs, impacts or dents, it is just like other users said ''a dust cover.'' It fits like a glove on my new, purchased on August 28th, 2015, '65 Fender Deluxe Reverb Reissue, that I can tell you that it fits 100% perfect. I have not test it's water repel properties, I don't even know yet if it is capable of protecting water drops, like when you take the amp out of your car if there was a light rain, but I will update this review on that later. I have to admit that my amp looks really pretty in this cover. I gave it 5 stars because the price was right, the looks are great, it fits and it even covers all the amp all the way down to the bottom of the amp, so 100% perfect fit and it does what it is design for, to protect it against a bunch of dust that gets accumulated in my bedroom and tv rooom and can also provide a little but maybe enough protection against scratches in some situations. I did not take any stars out because of the cut it came with, since I know that is something that I would probably end up getting sooner or later with regular use and when it happens, I can easily fixed just like I did when I got this cover new. Bottom line: I like this cover and will recommend it as a light cover that would provide the protection that I stated above.	1
Not as good as the original "canvas" like covers; does the job.	1
This cover fit my DRR perfectly. Service was prompt, as expected from Amazon. Highly recommended.	1
great cover for the price.	1
As advertised.	1
Awesome ... just what I expect from Fender.	1
If you use the tremolo arm and walk althrough the stage, it is a must. I bought this package and used it for my three Fender guitars. The arm stays steady in the former position you let it, ready to be used instantly.	1
great stuff	1
If you have a strat and you don't have one of these under your whammy bar, you need to get it!  It adds a totally different fill.  Quicker response.	1
have options now	1
Great accessory for stabilizing wobbly tremolos, as well as for providing a wider range of smooth settings. Did the trick on my 2 Strats. More settings options and no more buzz. Without the spring, my trem was either one wind too-tight, or flapping in the wind, with no happy middle.  Think the springs are included for all new Fender guitars w/Trems, but if you buy used like me, the previous owner might not have installed it.	1
just what I needed for my tremolo handle on my Squier Bullet Strat.	1
Fits into the tremolo arm cavity of my Yamaha Pacifica 412 perfectly, and tightens up the action of the arm as promised.  Tough little springs.	1
One of the least known details for Strats, wherever they are made and including Squier Strats is that the screw in whammy bat can be stopped from Flopping around and stay in one position by pitting one of these in the screw hole before screwing the whammy bar in.	1
These worked perfectly on my Strat!	1
There is nothing that does what these little springs do...period!	1
This is a great solution. The missing star is because Fender should have embedded this solution in their guitar tremolo somehow. This is a practically a patch - though works great. One tip for not loosing the spring - apply some Vaselin or other grease on it before you put it in place, and it will stay in forever. No harm to your guitar	1
Just as expected plus they were made in the USA which made my day! 100% satisfied, worked flawlessly.	1
Perfect for my 2001 American Standard Strat. Easy to install. I'm quite satisfied with both, the product and the service.	1
Good replacement for standard "Fender vintage style" saddles. Those saddles are made with stainless steel and will never rust, including the screws. I have it in a 1992 American Standard Stratocaster. It shines like new. No any rust 22 years later! Currently it's only equipping more expensive guitars, like the American Deluxe, Jeff Beck Signature... I highly recommend replacing the Fender vintage saddles for these!	1
Although these didn't fit my two point tremolo on my squier deluxe strat, I used the screws that came with it. So know that this product, only fits on the american standard two point tremolo. As the intonation screw/slot holes on the saddles, There not perfectly centered, there more towards the left. But they felt like they were really well made.	1
I am sure these are the real deal but I got these instead of what I ordered which were tuning keys for an american standard strat--so I sent these back and never used them	1
If you have a trem bar a must have , Works great	1
These springs function as intended. I recently bought a 2014 MiM Strat. Not sure if these don't come with the spring or the store lost it. Either way, I disliked the trem arm being either tightened in one spot or loose. A little research led to these and they make the arm easy to maintain in any position. Also, the springs got rid of the wobble in the arm.  As others have mentioned, they're easy to over compress, so only tighten as much as needed to get rid of the looseness.	1
Just drop it into the tremolo  hole in your strat and screw in the arm.  Works like the original	1
worcked very nicely	1
Great set of parts, must have on hand!	1
Great Quality, Thanks Guys,David Gab www.vevo.com new music Video By David Gab & Tom Graham	1
Did the job.	1
Another hidden gem in my reviews. Your tremolo Fender guitar should of come with one of these. the more expensive guitars have a piece of tape to cover the tremolo attachment hole, and still hold your spring inside. How ever once you have attached the tremolo bar once or twice you have probably lost this spring that should be seated inside.	1
Tremolo springs for Fender Strat's, works with American and Mexican Strat's.  I have both and have tried them in both varieties.  It does exactly what it supposed to do, apply pressure so the tremolo bar stays in place.  I have my moods where I want  it to swing freely, and that is usually dependent upon mood as well as the guitar being played.  Recommended if you are looking for this type of spring, i would buy them again.	1
Perfect for keeping your bar where you want it.	1
These are so good and strong I actually cut "em in half and they do the job perfectly. My Vibrato arm stays right where I left it every time. Bought two bags for a rainy day. Steve B.	1
These little springs are the ones you get with your Stratocaster new however, they get lost and the tremolo arms don't stay in place but use the spring and it works as it was designed..	1
I bought two, new, cheapo "Strats" and neither was shipped with this spring. I bought them for a Starcaster but ended up using a ballpoint pen spring instead because the Fender springs were too long. Worked great on the Squire Bullet HH. Priced right for a lifetime supply. Probably would work for the Starcaster if you cut them in half (don't put out your eye in the process!)	1
at GC the sales folks said these didn't exist and everyone just plays with the arm flopping  just nonsense  great deal  cut some stiff pickup foam and wedged it into the spring to keep it from falling out again  thanks Amazon	1
I didn't even know I was missing this under my whammy bar but wow what a difference it makes.  The spring fit my 20 year old stratocaster with no trouble at all.  This is by far the most simple upgrade I have ever performed on a guitar.  12 in the pack means I have more than I will ever need if I lose this little guy again.	1
All the literature says that these springs are for the Fender American Series Stratocasters, but they also fit perfectly on my 2012 Fender Standard Stratocaster which is Made In Mexico.  The MIM Strat has a vintage tremolo block instead of the modern one on the American Standard series.  Before getting these springs, I'd been applying plumbers tape to my tremolo arm to stop it from hanging loose but that always wears out within a week or two.  These tiny springs solve the problem completely and seem to last forever.  The package comes with 12 springs so I have plenty of spares in case I somehow lose one.  The price of this product is right and it's Made in the USA too!  Excellent.	1
A MUST HAVE if you own a SRV stratocaster because the spring can fall out so, so easily.  This can be inserted very quickly.  the price is right and you get a lot of them for the price.	1
These provide spring tension on your bar, stabilizing it for quick access. I didn't know about these springs until a couple of months ago. Now I know they are a necessity for best performance.	1
I unscrewed my whammy bar, dropped one of these in the hole, then screwed the bar back on. Now it will stay where I put it instead of just dangling straight down.  I was afraid it might not work on my c. 2008 Roland-ready Strat since it was MIM (made in Mexico), but it works great.  The down side is that the spring will fall out whenever you take the bar off. (My case doesnt have enough room to keep the bar on.) But thats not the springs fault. ^_^	1
This particular cover did NOT fit my Frontman 212R. I got one from MF and it fit perfectly. Maybe some covers are made in countries with different measurements, like with clothing. The shipping was on time.	-1
The only reason I needed a cover for my amp is because my cat likes to scratch at the mesh front of the amp and this keeps her off of it.  Perfect solution.	1
I needed to get my Fender Pro 185 amp protected from the dust of my practice area (a garage) this was priced right and readily available so i purchased it. I am pleased with it. I don't move the amp a lot so i can not state how it would hold up gigging. But for this application it is excellent. The material is not real heavy but seems rugged enough to last me.	1
I had searched for at least two years for a cover for my&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fender-Frontman-212R/dp/B001L8IJ0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fender Frontman 212R</a>&nbsp;not knowing that this was the one I wanted. Thanks to one of the folks at a big box music store I found it.  The construction is perfect for my music room. This is not a padded cover that you want to use when transporting your amp to a gig - unless it's raining. It is sturdy and will keep dust and light moisture off your amp.  And the fit is perfect too.  Not only is this attractive and a genuine Fender part, but the price is right. Not that my amp is the most expensive one Fender makes - far from it - but I take care of my gear and this is an affordable way to protect my amp.  My only complaint is how Fender names it. The product title hides the fact that this is for the 212R. I would have purchased this years ago had I known. Other than that I am thoroughly pleased with this cover.	1
After playing guitar for over 40 years and using Fender amps, a cover is a must.  This cover was made to fit my Fender Frontman 212R 100W amp perfectly.  Now, I have no concerns when traveling or storing my amp when not in use.  For such a small price, I know my amp is well protected from dust, spills, physical damage, etc. Naturally, Amazon provided very quick delivery.  I always receive my orders well before the estimated delivery date.	1
Great fit and logo! Wish they have used a thicker vinyl for better protection against hits, but it does the job well.	1
Quality is unbelievable. Far exceeded my expectations. Taylor-made fit. And looks good. For under 20.00 bucks. Well worth the money.	1
Well, it would be a nice case if the latches worked properly. They don't however, so I'm sending it right back. The latches are crooked, do not engage properly, are difficult to close, and pop open all on their own. I'm not entrusting this case to keep my Tele secure.	-1
It survived making it out here with me to my deployment so I should say its durable enough to be thrown around by baggage handlers.  The two locking latches on the outside are a nice touch, I like the way they open and close, very durable feeling.  The interior is plush enough, doesn't scream hi-end product but it works for me.  If it can make it through a half-year deployment without falling apart, it deserves a full five stars.  I don't need anything decorative and it fulfills what I need it to do.  Plenty of room for cables, picks, a notebook, whammy bar, maybe even a pedal.  If something changes I'll post an update, otherwise, for the price I really like it.	1
This case is beautiful, extremely well designed, and sturdy. Very plush black padding, and a very snug fit for my new stratocaster. The black exterior contains double white stitching, with adjacent small white piping creating an excellent color contrast. It also matches the color of my stratocaster.  There are three sturdy locks, that have a substantial snap sound when opening/closing. The case also has protective metal caps, to protect the case when lying down or when standing on its side. Initially, I was going to buy a less expensive case, but since I would be keeping this for a long time, I thought I should buy a nicer case that would look good,and protect my guitar for a long time! I'm certainly glad I did! Also, FEDEX delivered it a day early, and without a scratch or ding! JTB	1
Before buying this case I contemplated purchasing the less expensive "Fender Accessories 099-6180-320_130443 Pro Series Strat/Tele Case", but after reading the reviews of both and especially comparing the specs, I decided upon this case. Glad I did! It is beautiful and tough, deserving of the Fender logo on the case. Outside the white stitching and trim on the contrasting black give the case a really expensive and professional look. The chrome latches (spring loaded pop up type) add the stylish look to complete a classy and sturdy case worthy of any Strat! Inside I found an adequate black plush lining to protect the guitar's finish, neck support near the headstock and a compartment with a cover to keep things in place and protected. This case is sturdy enough for storage and travel. This case is outstanding for good looks and protection.	1
It has the look and feel I wanted.  The price could have been lower, but it wasn't prohibitive.  The guitar for which I purchased this hard-shell case was the only one of mine for which I did not have such a case; and I wanted to correct that, so I did.  That's why I like it.  Nothing to love; just a problem corrected.	1
I got this as a replacement for my early 90's Bullet Series Squier by Fender, which was cutting out and otherwise flaky. This switch fit in the place of my old switch, but did not come with any sort of wiring schematic, so you have to sort of understand how this style of switch works. It has two 4-pole sides, but I only needed one of those sides.	1
I was messing around with the wiring in a MIM strat and I ended up melting the switch. So I ordered this one to replace it. Worked out perfect.	1
Perfect OEM.  ONE WORD OF WARNING, if you are not good at soldering and/or you don't have a good iron, don't try this yourself.  The contacts are very thin and will burn up in a hurry.

Perfect for my Squier rework - ditched the 8 inline plastic jobbie and replaced it with a solid switch. You can WORK with these. Did bend the connectors up a bit to give a little more clearance in the Squier strat body.	1
Better than the stock part on non-USA made guitars, but being Fender brand, it's overpriced.	1
Bought this for my first electric guitar that I'm currently rebuilding (Peavey Raptor Plus EXP). Since it's just switching between the pickups, I wouldn't need a super high-end selector switch. This works great for the guitar and was a direct fit. Already a noticible difference between swifching it back and forth from the stock selector switch. The new one is much smoother in transitioning.	1
Works great and it was a real Fender switch. Yay!!!!!	1
Great	1
no more crackling sounds as I change which pup I am playing through. Awesome!	1
Works perfectly. Easy to wire, and feels exactly as the 39 year old one that it replaced.	1
perfect I like , did the job	1
Worked great and is good quality. Not the best out there, but definitely worth the money.	1
I swapped out an Asian switch with this and it made a world of difference! They supply a Black and White button for the switch. Nice positive click on each setting.	1
It feels like it should.	1
It went 5 ways and did it tastefully. I'm standing here beside myself.	1
as expected	1
Great quality	1
Any guitar with the cheap circuit board type of switch is destined to fail and or get scratchybto the point of irritation!!! Replace it with one of these tried and true designed switches and you'll never regret it.	1
Great product, price and shipping time.  Thanks.	1
This is a direct replacement for the 5 way switch in a Fender Stratocaster. It was priced right and arrived quite promptly.	1
brand new factory perfect	1
Quality replacement for Squier junk.	1
Replaced the switch in a cheap Squier Mini with this.  Works well however it was a tight fit in the Squier Mini as the body route wasn't a standard depth.  The switch works perfectly as expected.	1
This switch is well made and it is a Fender Genuine Product in original packaging. I have yet to install it but it is for sure a top quality part.	1
Fell apart when I installed it. Junk. Do not buy it.	-1
Very nice solid 5-way switch. It came in plain packaging. Works as it should.	1
Awesome item. well constructed	1
Got exactly what I ordered.  Much better than the stock switch in my Classic Vibe Squier.	1
Great switch. Fit my tele just fine and has no noise.	1
stock Fender, good price	1
Working good so far on my Ibanez Roadstar 2. No complaints!	1
It's Fender, it's 5 way, it works.  Not sure what else you can say.  Not sure it makes me play better, but it adds some interesting possibilities to my Telecaster.	1
I installed this with no problems, and it seemed more sturdy than the previous 5-way switch I had installed in my strat. There is no wobbling when selecting pickups, and when soldering in the wires the "wire holders", for lack of a technical term, stay in place. I had purchased a CTS 5-way switch before and it had both of these issues. This thing just does the job, can't complain for such a cheap price.	1
Solid switch. Easy to install.	1
Worked great in my squire strat with all new internal upgrades and copper shielding.  I did have to sand the guitar and put some electrical tape for insulation on the shielding around the switch since it was larger than what originally came in the guitar.	1
Very reliable and good quality.  Using these for upgrading Squire.	1
works good solidly built	1
nice switch for tele	1
GREAT QUALITY. ABSOLUTELY WHAT I NEEDED. DESCRIPTION AND PHOTO ARE ACCURATE.	1
yes I like these switches !	1
EXCELLENT PRODUCT	1
This is a genuine Fender Stratocaster five way switch. It is a top quality product that works perfectly and should last a lifetime if installed properly. This switch is expensive in comparison to similar products, but this is a case of "you get what you pay for." A word of caution to hobbyists who have never installed one before: Always use a low power soldering iron, "tin" your wires before installation and work very quickly when you are soldering the wires to the switch terminals. It is easy to damage the delicate terminals with too much heat, thus ruining the switch. (This is the voice of experience speaking to you.)	1
This is the real deal. Sturdy, solid, and it comes with mounting screws and plastic tipS, one black, one white.	1
Very good genuine Fender!	1
It's the factory switch, what more can you say? Probably more expensive because the bag says Fender. I'm sure they buy it from somebody for pennies but it is the real deal for American Strats.	1
Nice just be neat about solder or you can spill it inside a make the switch Jam Up !	1
Less expensive here than a well known chain in your town so I got several.	1
excellent Product	1
Works just like it's supposed to. I'd buy it again.	1
Another perfect fender part made by fender. I know parts are parts, but you get what you pay for. I would definitely recommend this for a replacement	1
Working great on my Stratocaster. Excellent purchase. Feels good to switch positions solid and quiet. I should've bought this to replace the original switch from the start.	1
I recently purchased a strat and immediately replaced all the electronics. I replaced the factory squire type selector switch *solid state type* with this factory mechanical switch... works great!!!	1
Bought a couple of these to build pre-loaded pickguards for strats. They work just fine, nice solid feel, screws included, and white or black tips. There are two rows of connectors	1
It works. It's smooth. And you can choose between the black or the white tip to grab it. It works.	1
I replaced a 5-way switch in a partscaster strat during a pickup & electronics upgrade.  The original switch worked, but I figured I'd replace it anyway.  This new switch works fine and has a slightly smoother feel to it (while switching).	1
Great product. It works and functions as it should. It does not steal from me, it does not lie to me, so its good.	1
When you go with a fender product you can count on quality. I recommend this switch for any guitar that needs a quality component.	1
this has a good weight, nice connections, and all together fender charm. pretty decent price compared to GC as well	1
First of all, a little Amazon 101 - review the PRODUCT, not the service or the vendor.  Giving out 1-star ratings because you had a shipping issue or because some third party (like Fender) didn't get you the right model is unfortunate, but it has nothing to do with the product itself.  All you do is create the impression that this is a poorly-designed product, when exactly the opposite is the case.  I have a Fender 5-way in my loaded pickguard as part of a Squier upgrade.  Beware that traditional Strats are 1 3/4" thick, where as many Bullets and Affinity Strats are slightly less than that.  As such, you might have the bottom of this switch hitting the inside of the guitar.  You might need to either live with this or shave/sand out a portion of the interior if that's the case.  But the switch itself works great and, really, is quite inexpensive relative to its importance!	1
I got a four way switch instead of a five way. All the packaging said it was a five way so I assumed this was just a one time mix up but apparently this has happened to a few other people. I just kept it (the four ways are more expensive and I'm planning on buying a Tele anyway) but if you're looking for the five way switch it might be better to look elsewhere.	-1
Twice I order two -5- way switches from this store , & each time I recieve only one -5- way switch. The other was a -4- way"packed in a 5 way bag. to have this happen once would be understandable, but twice in two orders is no accident. this company is not reliable. I did not need to open the items to see the differance, the seller can see what there packing & sends the wrong item.	-1
The package is not the same as the one shown in the description but it still has the fender logo and the screws do match the rest of the pickguard screws on my guitar. so, it is worth the money.	1
What can I say they are srews and they held my pickgaurd in place. they fit in the factory hole without a problem. nothing fancy they just work.	1
They have slightly more of a nickel finish than chrome and look way better, and they give u some spares.	1
These screws are not a shiny chrome, so they worked perfectly for my pearl pickguard and black Fender Strat body. They are good quality screws.	1
These are screws, people. They are replacements for the ones you lost. They do what they're supposed to.	1
Great Product	1
Exactly what I needed for my pickguard	1
Used these to replace 50 year old screws on a Silvertone (Teicho) electric guitar.	1
best screw real fender	1
Very nice pick plate. I've both 2 of them and both look great. Not too green. They have that classic vibe.	1
decent quality	1
ok, it is what it is. read the title. it fit perfectly on my 2000 Mexican classic reissue. i paired this with a mint back plate and aged white knobs and pickup covers. this all went on a lake placid blue strat and i'm very happy with it. notice the notch above the neck pup hole. this helps with access to the truss adjust screw. still it's a pain to do. that and the hole pattern are different than a standard strat, so make sure you know the difference. the pick guard is  solid and sturdy, definitely not cheaply done.the mint color is really light which makes it seem a bit more relic like. works for me!	1
Great pick guard with one issue.  The top screw hole between the middle and neck pickups is approx 3/4" further forward than on standard 11 hole Stratocaster Pick Guards.  Not a huge issue, but should be noted.	1
Expensive for some screws but worth it !	1
Screws fit perfectly in my Telecaster.  Thanks.	1
I know a screw is a screw,but these are more better because they have good centered grooves and good quality playing. They are the perfect diameter for the size of countersink in the pickguard.	1
Theyre screws, and they're the correct size	1
Perfect fit and replacement for rusty/worn pickguard and backplate screws on my Standard Fat Strat, made in Mexico!	1
Nice job with the chrome finish on the screws. I used these to replace screws from Warmoth Guitar as those were really dull and made an expensive guitar build look cheep.	1
great	1
Excellent product. Thanks Amazon.	1
My 04' Mexi Strat had rusted screws...these replaced the. Not much else to say about it. It's a screw and I don't know if these will rust because that will take some years. Anyway...cheap and easy to replace so pick them up if your pick guard screws are looking odd.	1
love it!	1
Great product!	1
Look great	1
Original Equipment screws from Fender.  Perfect for restoration, or just replacing the missing ones.	1
I replaced a bunch of rusty screws on my Strat and J-Bass.  They look great.	1
The right screws, good price, nice quantity, mounted my new MIJ pick guard to my Fender MIJ Stratocaster perfectly.  Old rusty pick guard screws look nasty. A fresh bag of these makes the pick guard look new on any Fender electric.  I've used them on several of my Fender electrics, always work great.  I'll be back for more.  Good music to all!	1
The heads are a little smaller than standard Fender screws but I did not have any issues with them.	1
These are screws. They fit in strat pick guard holes pretty good.	1
Nice product, fits perfectly and looks good.	1
Genuine Fender.  Right color and right size as always.	1
very much as discribed.....	1
Actual Fender product	1
they work	1
Works, fender brand so you know it fits.	1
Exactly what I ordered. Fender pickguard screws.	1
husband says good	1
Good quality screws. I was going to go the cheaper route, but decided to spend the few extra dollars. Haven't looked back since. The screws are holding up well and aren't stripping like cheaper ones would likely do.	1
good	1
Kudos to Fender for making an amp like this available at this price point.  It has 25 watts of power, a 10 inch speaker, a real spring reverb, and it's a traditional analog circuit without a digital processor.  It will make your electric guitar sound pretty much the way it's supposed to.  The downside is that when I compare this amp to what Fender was selling fifteen years ago, the Champion 110, it falls a little short.  The particle board cabinet is thinner, the speaker is less hefty, and the whole thing feels and sounds a little less substantial.  It's obvious that the bean counters really pushed to get this thing as inexpensive as it is, and they also moved production to Indonesia from Mexico.  Maybe weight is a factor in shipping it across the ocean.  All the same, I can still recommend it because it beats the crap out of digital amps and it gives you substantial power and a 10" speaker and real Fender tone and looks.  Fender probably figures that players flush with cash will prefer a well-made tube amp or an amp with tons of digital modeling, but I kind of wish they still produced a solid 25 watt analog practice/light gigging amp.	1
I really needed a new amp because i just started playing guitar about a year ago and i had some off brand 5 watt amp that absolutely sucked so when i got this i was thrilled. it was loud enough to practice with my little band and the reverb on it is great. It has a pretty good over drive but i have a line 6 floor pod plus to go along with it wich makes it just perfect. if u are intermediate then i would suggest this. not to much for metal people unless u want to buy a pedal to go along with it. i would know ;)	1
I just bought this and the 15 watt Spider Line-6.  This Fender is far cleaner sounding, and had a lot more volume with almost no distortion at all.  The Spider Line-6 is way inferior even though it has more bells and whistles.  I'm adding this comparison because I bought the Spider Line-6 first, and wasn't pleased with it, so I ended up speanding a second $100 to get this Fender Frontman which I am well pleased with.  So if you're comparing these two amps, my vote goes for the Fender by a mile. (although the Fender has reverb only, so if you're looking for a distorted sound then maybe you'll like the Spider Line-6 better).  But if you want CLEAN sound and lots of volume without distoration, this Fender Frontman is the way to go!  I'm well pleased with it.  This also has plenty of volume for actual performances in small places.  I can't imagine wanting more volume in a small bar or cafe unless you are trying to hurt people's ears.	1
Exactly as described. Replaced a few rusted screws on a Jag and a Strat. Didn't have the issues left by other reviewers. These are chrome plated Fender screws, 24 in total.	1
Good quality screws.	1
Why even have the option to review screws?	1
The best damn screw you'll ever buy!	1
Solid replacement screws ,	1
Purchase twice and will purchase again.  Great for projects or if you want to freshen up your old rusty screws.	1
Worked wonderfully, great product, great price, thank you	1
ok	1
It's a chrome plated screw of reasonable hardness sized to fit Fender pick-guards.  Not much more to say.	1
I could have probably found these at a local hardware store but they were handy and I got them online at a reasonable price and they do exactly what they're supposed to do and they work well... Thank you!	1
arrived as described, genuine Fender parts. Excellent!	1
Perfect fit	1
Perfect	1
Nice Gold, right fit !!!	1
I'm very happy with this amp. Great for use at home and strong punch if you know how to set it up. I'd recommend this little thing.	1
Great classic Fender reverb simulation. Crystal clear guitar amplification. Almost sounds like old Fender Deluxe at a fraction of the cost. I ordered a 2nd one for a friend who heard it and uses it on a pedal steel guitar.	1
I am very pleased with my Frontman 25R. I purchased as a practice amp. The sound quality is very clear, and it has all the volume you will ever need. With the gain and drive cranked up to 10, I set the volume at 3. That is all the volume I need for practicing in my home. You could actually use it on an outdoor stage at level 10. I cranked it up to test it, and the sound quality was still clear at 10. I would recommend it as a good economical all around amp.	1
It's a great all around amp.  I got this for practice, my main amp is a Peavey Classic 50 tube amp, but was surprised how much I like it.  This amp doesn't have as many features like effects or modeling but what it does, it does well. It's got a nice clean sound and is powerful enough for practice or even light gigging and unlike my Classic 50, it's pretty light and portable.  You're not going to find a better sounding amp at this pricepoint. In my honest opinion.	1
Screws fit perfectly for my pickguard.	1
These fit my franken tele just fine	1
Nice plating.  The size, and the threads seem to match up perfectly with the originals.  Glad I had the extras to mount the gold bridge cover...which didn't come with any.	1
Exactly as expected.	1
Nice Item	1
I have several other amps ranging from half stacks to twins and this little guy fills a definite hole. I mainly play an American Standard Tele and the 25R fits her like a glove. I love the tone and the reverb for $100 is amazing! The dirty channe is what it is, but the clean channel is worth the price of admission.  I can imagine using this guy for a small gig, but I mainly use it for practice and jamming over night while everyone else is sleeping. If you are in the market for a sweet little amp with a very rich clean channel and classic spring reverb you should look no further, this really is a great little amp!  **Update** If you are interested in a DIY amp stand that will enhance the sound of the amp, check out my review and amp stand plans for the 25R on my website!

love it	1
I got the Frontman mainly to use around the house for guitar and bass. The 10" speaker seemed like an advantage (especially for bass) over several in the same price range with 8" speakers. The first surprise was that the assembly resonated around the low A of a bass, even at quite moderate volume. We're not talking about gigging level. Hard to say if it was the speaker, the cabinet, or something loose inside. The second and almost simultaneous surprise, when I started playing guitar, was that the dog was clearly suffering, and began howling. The third, a little later, was that my wife, who's very tactful and wouldn't complain, went to the bathroom and gobbled a xanax.  It's a simple solid state analog amp. It behaves well and predictably with pedals and stomp boxes, and you can somewhat control distortion with the guitar's volume pots. In the good value for money column, it is a loud little bugger. If you can get up to 6 on the master knob without the neighbors coming over with pitchforks and torches, you're probably living in the woods. I wouldn't try that with a bass unless you want to shred the paper speaker cone. But above 6, another surprise: nothing much changes.  The tone is a lot like one of those early "advanced solid state" Fender amps that made people return to tubes. Sizzzzling. Remember those Fender amps with the shiny aluminum front panel? A lot of unpleasant harmonics develop as soon as you overdrive it. Basically a square wave running into a high slew rate power stage. That explains the dog, and the wife. It's perfect for one of those "plants die from loud rock music" science fair projects.  There's a VERY GOOD clean mode, and a little button located invisibly that switches to overdrive mode with its own gain and volume knobs, so you can set levels separately. A foot switch can be used to switch modes. There's a spring reverb effect that sounds choppy. And that's it. But when I say "clean", I don't mean "bluesy" or "jazz". I mean electronics, it's just a power stage. And it's unlikely to get a pleasing tone on overdrive, especially at low volume, where at best it sounds like a fuzztone. That's how solid state works, and why most guitarists went back to tubes. You would have to use external pedals/boxes, which sort of defeats the idea of simplicity. As a standalone practice amp, it's like getting a (hot) stick shift pickup truck where you wanted a sedan.  Now, I can understand that some people like it simple and hate computerized stuff because they don't "get it", others because they do, but have had enough techno-headaches. OK, so the Frontman is simple. But it's just not a nice-sounding circuit when you push it into saturation. So you'll NEED those not-so-simple external boxes that belong more with a performing setup. If you already have 'em, the Frontman WILL work VERY WELL for you, as just a clean power stage. Do you need a low-medium power stage?  I wanted something portable, self-contained, with living-room or coffee-shop power, AND that sounded good on its own at bedroom volume. I found that if I was willing to sacrifice a little in the wattage column, one of the more modern programmable "modeling amps" like a Mustang, with a little trial and error, could sound more like what I wanted WITHOUT requiring external boxes, and for the same minimal cost. In fact, feeding one of those modeling amps into the house PA is usable for performance. The Frontman aims at a middle ground that IMHO is increasingly irrelevant. It went back.	-1
Perfect just what I needed.	1
I needed some screws for a Jazz Bass copy project. I thought about trying to find the size at a Home Depot.  I ended up just buying these for $6 at GC.  Saved the hassle and spent a couple more bucks. They are more like a brushed nickel top.	1
again?	1
The Stuff	1
The right parts for the job	1
They are screws. Made of metal, have nice little spirals along the shaft and a nifty little cross shaped slot in the top to turn them with. They fit in the pre-cut holes on Fender pickguards and accessory pieces. Not sure how they could have screwed these up...	1
Perfect and there's plenty of them	1
excellent product, I am very happy and satisfied, I recommend	1
24 screws at a good price.	1
Good product  !!!	1
satisfied	1
Perfevt !!!!	1
Fender Frontman 25R Electric Guitar Amplifier that gives me plenty of volume and control for the price. It is a great product for the beginner to the more advance player.	1
I know that there are several good amps in the $100.  This Fender is terrific for my $100.  Looks and works great.  Far more power than I need for my practice are.  I like the reverb, accessory jacks and the amp's adjustability.	1
nice parts original	1
Exact match for existing screws	1
Great seller and great product. Arrived promptly with expedited shipping, very happy with my purchase.	1
Classic Phillips head screws. Excellent quality that fit almost every Fender ever made.	1
excellent	1
You get a 10" speaker and separate drive control volume with this amp; try to find those two capabilities in another amp for around $90.00!!!!!!!!!!!! This is by far the best practice amp I have found in the past 10 years and I own a butt load of new amps. I have actually upgraded to a Champion 40, but still use this amp as much as the 40.  Don't even think about it, this is one of the best (under $100.00) practice amps, unless you are looking for a gadget filled amp, and in that case you should look elsewhere, as this one is for turning on and going for it and not fiddling around with digital controls until you have just lost most of your practice time.  As an addendum, I would like to add that you should probably not try to replace the speaker as I have read from other reviewers. I have a few of these amps, so just for the heck of it, I put in a Celestion G10 Greenback (which costs more than the 25R) and was very disappointed with the results. This amp is not being carried by a lot of retailers now, but can still be had new for under $100.00 if you just do an internet search.	1
I was buying a pawn shop guitar, when paying they handed me this amp and stated it came with the guitar. I didn't expect to actually use it but what the heck, I could sell it and make a bit of money back. Got home to set up my new pawn shop guitar and plugged into the Frontman 25 just to see if it worked. I was surprised to find out not only did it work, it sounded very good. I own a Deluxe Reverb all tube amp and the little Frontman 25 had the Fender sound. What really was impressive was the reverb, it went from a nice echo to full fledge drippy surf sound. I actually took it to a few small gigs and it did very well, I normally use a Blues Jr for small gigs but the Frontman did a fine job. On some smaller gigs when all I need is a little reverb I just plug straight into the amp and it worked well, plenty of volume and smooth reverb plus it's small and easy on the back. All in all very impressed and have decided to keep it. I would easily pay full retail, it is a nice little amp, might even see if I can squeeze a 12 inch speaker into it!	1
You could go to your nearest hardware store and get these screws. But Fender makes it easy on you and separate and couple of screws in this convenient package. This is a very simples and easy way to update and maintain your old rusty guitar. Mine is 25 years old and this is the second time I replace the screws and to get a fresh new look for my Strat.	1
It actually looks more like a NICKEL than a shiny CHROME.	-1
Yup, they work!  Lol	1
If you buy a Fender bridge cover (ashtray) it does  not come with mounting screws so Fender makes you buy a package of about 20 screws to use the 2 you need for the bridge cover. So, these are those screws.  They are very nice screws and do the job they were intended for.	1
A perfect fender replacement.  for the squire P Bass pickguard screws.	1
The right screws	1
thanks	1
Very nice.	1
thank you	1
Fit great on my mexican fender jazz bass.	1
perfect....works great	1
i got mine yesterday and love it, it sounds grate ,i didn't know what amp to get, i looked and looked ,read a lot of reviews and even got on YouTube to see what people had to say, and seems this one had a lot of good reviews,, i knew fender has a good name for amps , and for the money this one was the one, i am so glad i got it , it gave life to my electric guitar, i bought mine somewhere else ,but still grate amp ,,i didn't want to spend a lot of money for an amp ,and didn't want to get something small  for 20 or 30 dollars less and would out grow with my music,as i get better playing guitar, but figure this amp will do me just fine for many years to come and it will. this will save me money in the long-run ,i am very happy with it,i like the five year warranty that came with it, you can't go wrong ,great sound,, and its not to big ,,nice size amp,,and  easy to pick-up,,nice looking amp ,,	1
I actually bought this amp at a pawn shop for $60, but i would have paid the retail price if i had bought it new, with no complaints. For such a small combo, this amp really packs a punch. It is plenty loud, and is just fine for smaller club gigs. However, you could use it in larger venues also, since you generally mic up your amp anyway, and get most of your sound from monitors. Anyway, the clean channel is what you would expect from any Fender amp, with good tone and crisp reverb. The high gain channel is really fat sounding. I still use distortion pedals, and generally leave it on the clean channel so i can switch back and forth between clean and distortion with ease (not sure if there is a foot switch for the amp, since my pawn shop purchase didn't include one), but without a pedal, the high gain channel performs adequately. For the price, this is really an upper echelon amp in my opinion. Kind of does away with the need for a half stack, unless you are really gigging frequently at larger venues or outdoors. Plus, it is far lighter and easier to transport, lol.	1
I usually do not write reviews, but I love this amp. It sounds great and gets a loud enough to have some fun with. Nice bottom end, nice tone,  and fun to play through. It is far better then the Frontman 10 and 15 ( which are basically toys compared to this) It is almost loud enough to have band practice with it (I have not tried it, but I use my Deluxe for that) I have recorded with it  - and even use it for practice in a big band (guitar does not need much volume for a big band) It is well built, solid, yet  light to carry. It has inputs for an ipod to practice with. It has a real spring reverb! Sounds great. Nice warm 'Fender' Tone (sounds almost tube) The 2 channels with very different sound It looks cool. I have tried many of these small amps at the guitar center and this sounded the best - and was one of the cheapest too. This is not a toy amp - it is something you can get many years of use out of from beginner to pro.  I have even used this for practice with an 18 piece  big band I play with when we rehearse in a smaller room - and with a little pre-eq pedal I have to take a bit of the mid out - it sounds great. For big rooms I need the power of a larger amp	1
Sounds great and clean, if you want something to practice, way to go! Not too powerful for gigs, keep this in mind.  I don't know if is the amp, but when I turn up the tone controls of my guitar, makes sounds like a fly.  Maybe i'm wrong and this is the good guy and the bad boy is the guitar.	1
I looked at amps for months. Finally decided on the Frontman. Wanted a practice amp but something better than the Peavey Rage 158 I had that sounded horrible and buzzed like crazy. At first I was intrigued by the modeling amps out there especially the Vox -the Fender controls were too counter-intuitive to use without having the manual in hand all the time. I looked at all-tube practice amps but decided that nothing was going to give me a decent sound without at least a 10 inch speaker. The tube amps at that size were great but broke the bank. The modeling amps lost their appeal, if I want an effect I decided using a pedal sounds much better regardless of what it is attached to (tube or  and much easier to use. I read a couple of the reviews on the Frontman which I had initially pooh-poohed and couldn't believe the beautiful clean tones and low end. I went to distortion and that sounds fine too-not as good as with a pedal but what I expected-I am mostly a "clean" guy anyway. Looked at the price of only $100 and thought, what am I missing? Decided I wasn't missing anything when I turned in a little reverb  I don't ever use a lot of reverb but I always use a little. I have had the amp a few weeks now and i am continued to be blown away at the clean tone.  By the way, it will play very vry loud before it starts to break up. Perfect practice amp. Great purchase, arrived in one day.	1
nice replacement for pickgaurd replacements	1
Excellent Product!	1
Strat project eye candy ;)	1
Nice quality and finish.	1
Perfect fit for my MIM Strat.	1
Powerful pickups for a great price! I personally wouldn't buy them for a second guitar, because the sound is a bit tinny and way to bright. If you use distortion and really drive them they are great for that, but clean is a bit on the ears. Some people are looking for this tone, I should have know I was getting a Stevie Ray Vaughn sounding pickup by the name. I was looking for a clear and warmer sound, more Hendrix/Mayer.	1
Very good	1
Can't have enough spare screws around if you build or alter guitars of which I do both.  I will order more of these as they were the perfect size with a good finish.	1
Honestly...what can one say about screws..ohh shiny... Actually excellent OEM style screws, no more scratches from torn slots.	1
fender orginial is the way to go...very reasonable price and made well. these fit just fine. will purchase again for other fender guitars	1
Just the item I needed to build my own personal custom made genuine "Fender" guitar. I was able to buy all the parts (here on Amazon) to make my own custom "fender" guitar at half the cost that Fenders website wanted.	1

muy bien	1
What can you say.... its Fender	1
Like it says made in taiwan sO who knows whats in it, lead, cadmium all heavy metals and not the good kind they also small not big for a fender pickguard. picture shown on amazon site is gold fender packaging i got the red package so maybe thiers a  differance, hence the 5 star reviews. also the same thing with fender neck screws not chrome but dull nickle garbage made in taiwan the only way i get fender chrome neck screws is when they come with a fender neck plate and those seem to be made in u.s.a. the only solution i can think of is buy from another company like ernie ball or dimarzio made in u.s as far as i know or go to hardware store and find what your looking for. contact fender for the die hards or seller who your buying from.as for these s' are going in the garbage.	-1
Exactly what they say they are. Came with over 20 screws, so plenty of extras over the 13 I needed.	1
Look clean.	1
I can't believe these were actually sent to me. The heads are smaller than normal pickguard screws and the metal is blackened. They come from Taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to China. I am sending them back. There is no way I would use these. Any screw you get from Home Depot would work better and look more attractive. I am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from Fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost.	-1
Pretty disappointed in the color. As the review title indicates, what I received is more of a 'black chrome' or dingy stainless color. These are simply not going to work with the MOTS pickguard I purchased them for. Perhaps they would blend in better on a black, black pearl or tort pickguard.  I ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result. Perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is 'bad'. Some are very dull looking. Very disappointing, really.	-1
This is my third Dampit. It is 1/2 the size of the other two.	-1
The look was hardly consistent with the photos.  The sound was bland.  I recommend looking on ebay for used maracas with more character.	-1
I hate leaving a poor review but I'm mad at myself for not paying attention to the obvious signs that this company (G&G) is going downhill fast. Please visit G&G's website for insight into this decline. Watch the videos and check out the empty "2013 products page coming soon".  Let's start out by saying the packaging was completely intact both from Amazon and the original box. Wrapped in plastic inside is the case. A minor tear in the fabric and some defects in the tweed show a lack of pride in workmanship. As I open the case the latch hasp (the U shaped piece that goes into the locking mechanism) goes flying across the floor. attempts to reseat it fail because it is not aligned properly and because the holes have been enlarged from the original forced seating. This will probably mean the whole system need to be replaced.  Not what you want to do for a nearly $200 guitar case.	-1
So I was really excited to get this case today, and upon opening the package, all my hopes were dashed instantly. After removing the case from its plastic bag, the first thing I noticed was a nice 1/8" hole in the tweed, just to the bottom-left of the carrying handle. It was so bad, you could directly see the under-surface of the case. Not good.  After noticing that annoyance, I inspected the latches, and they don't even sit flush against their respective clasps once closed! You'd think once they click closed, they'd be flush with their counterpart. Nope. Not on the case I received. They stick out about 3-4mm once closed.  As far as the finish of the case, the tweed looked good (except for that obvious hole), but the gold hardware on the case I received just looked awful. There were scratches and tarnish marks on nearly every piece I inspected. Thankfully Amazon has a world-class return policy, as this thing is going back in the morning. There's absolutely no way this this is worth $180.00, and at the level of quality? I'd honestly rather just put my Strat and Tele in their respective gig bags.	-1
I use, and am very happy with, many Behringer effects for my bass guitars.  I was excited to try this unit. When I opened the box, to my surprise, I found that the power cord was for use in some other country other then the United States.  There was no adapter included and I have no idea what country the plug was designed for. I returned the unit with absolutely no problems. DON'T let this discourage you. Amazon and Behringer are solid, reputable, companies. Just contact Amazon before you order to be sure you receive the appropriate power cord.	-1
"These are the best vintage straps you can buy for the price and they look cool. Fender also makes a better quality vintage strap with a leather backing instead of felt. After using both for years, I kind of lean towards these because they are not so bulky, and look a little more vintage authentic with the felt backing. I like the way the strap fits in the strap button better as well. They are also cheaper, which is a plus. I would use the thicker vintage straps if the guitar you are using is a particularly heavy one, say over eight pounds, as the shoulder pad will give you better support."  That was my old review. I have purchased, in the past, four of these straps and they were all fine. I just received a new one that has a made in China tag sewed onto the felt and it is garbage. I suggest if you get one of these Chinese made straps and it is made incorrectly, send it back. There is no reason to have to suffer such incompetence. I will include that your guitar will eventually fall off of one of these badly made Chinese straps. Use at your own risk. The holes at the top of the strap on the shoulder pad where the straps slide through are also cut wrong and too big. I would also like to ask the question of why these straps have become about three or four dollars more and they are being made in China. The only explanation I can come up with is greed. So not only are Americans losing their jobs, Americans who buy these badly made Chinese straps are also being charged more. Here is the letter I sent to the seller and also Fender:  "Why is everything made in China a disaster? I have purchased, thru Amazon, four of these straps and everyone has been fine. I believe they used to be made in either Canada or the USA [The leather was stamped Made in USA]. This is the first one where the "made in" tag is attached, which I would have to cut off because it is annoying. If you look at the picture on the Amazon website, you will see that the smaller strap has four adjustment holes. This one has one whole, so I cannot adjust the strap properly and the whole is right on the end so the strap doesn't go through the buckle properly. Further, the felt on one end feels like it has glue on it or something. Felt is supposed to be soft. This feels like it was sprayed with glue because the felt is hard and rough. Regardless of these issues, the strap button holes are way too small. They aren't even close to the proper size so that the strap ends flares way out, trying to hold on with the slit, and the strap is not secure. The strap button is being held onto with the slit of the leather. The strap will detach if the strap is left like this. I have included a picture showing you the ends of two of my straps to the right, and the ends of the new strap with the tag still attached on the left [I attached a photo showing both ends of two old straps and both ends of the new strap. The whole size is completely different. The whole size on the new Chinese strap is so ridiculously small that it shows the level of incompetence and horrible quality control on Fender's part.]. In order for me to correct these, I would have to go to my local shoe repair place, and the minimum cost of repair will be the cost of the strap. Why does everything made in China come complete with some problem or issue? It is extremely frustrating having to deal with this kind of incompetence for no reason. Even if they were made incorrectly, Fender has to be responsible for quality control. It doesn't take a genius to see the whole is the wrong size. I could see it the moment I pulled it out of the package. This is maddening. Mistakes are made, people are human. I can accept that. But this is flagrant. There is no excuse on Fenders part and this can't be the first time this issue has come to your attention, which is perhaps why you don't have anymore of these. It is a waste of my time to have to take pictures and type emails and all the rest for an eleven dollar strap. How do you want me to proceed?"	-1
It's so thin it puts a lot of strain on your shoulder even with the padded bit. And it's not really padded. Just broader. Not good at all.	-1
This not really vintage strap arrived today. I was looking at them a long time and thought they looked cool. Really they look cheap as they can get. The buckle looks silly and I won't put this crap strap on any of my nice guitars. I put it in a box with my other screw up. What was I thinking, I could get a nice guitar strap for $13.00. Just get screwed for that much. I ordered the $18.00 one and am hopeful on this one.	-1
Junk.  save you money. leather is too soft.  wears out really fast	-1
The ones they used to make in the USA where good. When they started switching manufacture to China they stunk. Strap buttons were to small, they didn't have the proper holes punched in the correct places, glue on the felt, pad belt holes to large, etc. The design is good, the manufacturing in China is poor. If you get one and it isn't right, send it back. Fender aftermarket products stink, in general. Fender QC has really gone down the tubes with its aftermarket parts.	-1
The quality is not what it use to be on these, I am very disappointed. I ended up throwing it away, I would of returned it but I had to mod the plastic base slightly to sit flush. As a degreed luthier I say stay away!	-1
Sounds like crap.	-1
Will no take off shipping oil	-1
Didn't work very good!  Couldn't see any difference.	-1
I ended up using brasso on all my cymbals, because these cymbal cleaners are a joke. I've tried most of them. When you use brasso make sure you don't wipe off the logos though!	-1
The microphone didn't work with my keyboard (it ended up needing a Dynamic Microphone). And if you get this, make sure you get an adapter so you can easily plug it to an amplifier too.  (I got a better deal at Radio Shack on a better mic, I could've gotten a better stand for the same price too, oh well...) When I finally did try the microphone on an amplifier, the sound was so soft, you can hardly hear it. I'll keep this for the microphone stand, although next time I'd choose a stand that doesn't have these three legs you can trip on.  When I got this microphone, the seller packed it badly. The box was falling apart, tape open, box was beat up, paper work falling out. I'd think twice before buying from a seller who's not Amazon direct.	-1
Every single one of these stands broke in either one place or another. Screws stripped. Metal pieces broke off. A nightmare. I've spent more time trying to fix these stands than actually using them. Go spend a few more dollars for better made stands. Horrible.	-1
I am a beginner to intermediate guitar player who plays acoustic guitar daily at home for fun. I have 3 guitars and I typically use the Martin Marquis Custom M1400 Silk & Steel 0.115  0.047 strings, which are absolutely amazing, on my steel string acoustics.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Martin-M1400-Marquis-Silk-Steel-Acoustic-Strings/dp/B0002GZQEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Martin M1400 Marquis Silk & Steel Acoustic Strings</a>. I saw these Martin Acoustic M140 80/20 Bronze (light .012/.054) strings as an add on item here on Amazon for $4.00 which is a phenomenal deal and decided to give them a try. They have great reviews and these same strings cost around $8-$12 at a local shop. These strings are also made by Martin, but they are definitely not my favorite. Please keep in mind the quality of the strings is top notch and this review comes down to personal preference and opinion as far as feel and tone, which is subjective. While I gave these strings 2 stars for perfect quality and packaging, I will never buy them again due to their feel and sound. When I put these strings on my Gibson Epiphone, they looked beautiful. If your guitar has a natural finish, these bronze/gold strings will compliment it nicely. Only the lowest 4 strings are gold, the highest/thinnest two are silver. These strings are the ones for you if you prefer a sharp harsh twangy attack without much ring. They sound flat, tinny, and lifeless to me. And its not just me  my husband who knows absolutely nothing about guitars or strings came home to me playing on these new strings and said whats wrong with your guitar?. I thought maybe they just needed breaking in and continued to play with them for a few days, but there was no change in the sound or feel. Playing on them made me NOT want to play guitar, which I typically love. I threw them out after about a week. Sound aside, I also could not stand the feel of them. They feel rough and clunky compared to my aforementioned favorite Martin strings which are silky smooth, easy on the fingers, and great for sliding around the fret board. I could have gotten on board with these strings if they were rough on the fingers yet sounded amazing, unfortunately, that was not the case.	-1
No, go D'Addario any day of the week	-1
I received a 12AX7 tube instead of the 12AU7 tube. I've heard that JJ Electronics are decent tubes for headphone amps but you definitely can not use a 12AX7 tube in a headphone amp that uses 12AU7 tubes. You get a really quiet and very distorted sound. The seller ToysNGamesEtc had a barcode on the tube box that said it was a 12AU7 tube but the rest of the box was clearly labeled as a 12AX7. I guess perhaps just avoid buying from that seller?	-1
1 out of 3 was DOA. Did not bother trying to return as the cost of shipping back was be equal to or greater then cost of 1 tube. Live and learn. Was retubing my Budda SDII 18 and fortunately I had a couple of spare pre-amp tubes laying around to get the jog done. Have tried other pre-amp tubes in this amp and for some reason to my ear these inexpensive JJ 12AX7 sound the best.	-1
Put it in... this one wasvery bright and very noisy. Lots more gain and volune than stock though, but not iseable imho. Worked, but not for me	-1
Bought 4 of these for my JCM 2000. Worked fine initially, but one out of the 4 burned up just outside of the warranty period. Had the previous EH set for well over a year with no problems. Disappointed.	-1
Noise was very pronounced with a presonus tube pre.	-1
I guess I got a bad one; I put it in my Orange Micro Terror and it was like a third of the volume of the original tube.  I got a Peavey something-or-other from a local shop (also an ECC83) and it was fine.	-1
These tubes were dead within two weeks. I biased them at 70 because they were a lot hotter and grittier than the GrooveTubes I had in my Fender HRD III and they still packed a lot more heat. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I didn't like that I didn't have the ability to dial down the distortion any. Even at it's lowest, it was pretty hot. Even biased at 70. All that aside, my biggest issue was that they were dead in two months and I am unable to return. Time to go spend my money (again) on something else.	-1
These tubes are utter s***e. I replaced all the tubes on my 1983 Mesa Boogie Mk3 and, as soon as I did, it sounded like crap and was noisy as hell.  I played a gig that weekend and the input section melted. I had to use a back-up amp to finish the show. Stay away from these BS tubes.	-1
Just was not what I thought it was going to be in reference to enhancing the sound...  Just not for me; However, this may be great for others...  Do some research, take a listen for yourself.	-1
This was a new experiment I will not repeat. The reed quality is not bad, but the cutting disappointing. One reed was split at the lip, cut too fine. I'll have to lengthen the face on the rest to broaden the sound.	-1
I got this in 2008 for my son. It worked for short time and then started to be very hard to open and close. Everytime he practiced, he had to ask me to open and close. Then it broke before even 6 months of use.	-1
This stand is a DISASTER every time we use it. Not only does the stand not allow any adjustment of its music support in any direction--neither tilting back or forward or turning left or right, the top is not attached to the bottom with any kind of fastener. It just slips on the post at only one angle and one direction, the direction of the base. So to adjust the stand even the least bit, you're going to need to pick the whole thing up. And every other time you try to move the stand a little to get it sitting right, you invariably forget and lift it by the top, which slips off the post, with all the music on it which of course falls to the ground, hopefully not during a gig. I HATE THIS STAND.  There are far better stands for the same price, like the SLM stand I use all the time, adjusts in every direction, and has fasteners for everything that moves or comes apart.	-1
Sent it back right away. Stand had a terrible creak in it and wasn't stable at the base. Got an On Stage tripod mount and couldn't be happier.	-1
While this has come in handy in a pinch, they are not made well.  The stand's attachment to the base strips very easily and the threads on the top of the stand do the same.	-1
This is a very amateurish recorder, not even suitable for kids. Sounds weak and cheap. Other Yamaha recorders I use play much better. Stay away from this tenor.	-1
You get what you pay for as these worked good for 10 or 12 gigs but then at least 3 of them were faulty. Too delicate (especially the actual end connectors) to last for road use. Might be OK for fixed installation or usage.	-1
Require lot of force to produce sound. Slide mechanism is good. Not worth price.	-1
I bought this recorder from Amazon while I was travelling in the USA. I don't like the sound that this recorder produces. It sounds like there is some sort of debris in the air duct that makes the sound not "smooth". However, a visual observation doesn't seem to show the existence of any debris nor any damage with the recorder. The fipple / labium etc look just fine. I am guessing that I might have gotten a bad copy. I have 3 other recorders of different brands and they all sound much nicer than this YRS302B.	-1
Personally I don't like the sliding sound from bass wound strings, unfortunately this product doesn't reduce it.  To reduce string noise lower the action and lift fingers	-1
applicator design is not as good as the fast fret.. contains more lube than the fast fret, but useless if applicator doesn't work right.. the lube itself is more like lemon oil, as opposed to the mineral oil in the fast fret.  I don't care for this one.	-1
Sturdy, but needs handles.  Poor carpet job on it.  Couple of the corners are lose.	-1
Although there are not many to choose from for the MXL condenser microphones (which is why i purchased this garbage), this one is really less than sufficient. The first time in use, the microphone stand was bumped and the shockmount hit the carpet. It was no longer usable so i had to purchase a hair tie to rewrap the clips. Crap.	-1
It looks good in the picture but it's not what I expected at all.  It's cheaply constructed, not good, almost garbage.  I purchased this based on the overwhelming number of positive 4 and 5 star reviews I read here.  I can't say for sure but this might just be a carbon copy of the one also available here for around $11.00 How does it perform?  I don't know yet and right now I don't care because I'm holding a piece of cheap junk that I don't have the time to mess with doing returns and everything else.  This isn't good enough to say is for amateurs.  Hopefully it does the job and I'm not going to worry about the $15.00 or so more that I paid unnecessarily.  WAY overpriced???  I WILL say that.  I'm very disappointed.  $35.00+???  REALLY???	-1
The ratio between the pick and thumb is poor. Very floppy and unusable.	-1
Just to echo the sentiment here, the thumb tab is too flimsy and doesn't hold securely.  I have large hands and was hoping that some of these reviewers were just small thumbed players.  I was wrong.  If that part was a bit thicker like normal thumb picks these would be great.  Oh how I wish someone could make this pick the way we all want.	-1
Not worth it for the price. Just buy thumb picks and flat picks and save money.	-1
way too thick for me, should've gotten the lightest one	-1
Quite a bit that doesn't work with this design. Meinl has a much better product ... for my personal taste.	-1
These are slightly heavier than a standard beaded chain, but actually in my opinion sound worse. They dampen the sound more than a standard beaded pull chain and are 5x the price.	-1
Not much sizzle.	-1
Good	-1
Not quite the sizzle sound of rivets. Dampens the wash.	-1
This rosin is trash. Has a huge amount of "flake off" all over your strings and violin- never had this happen with Pirastro or Bernardel. For this reason, I'd avoid this one and spend a few dollars more to get Pirastro or Bernardel. MUCH higher quality.	-1
This is a Novelty item, not a beginners practice tool. The Tone is not good.	-1
With no input plugged into amplifier, there is a horrible hum when plugged into wall outlet (multiple adapters tried), but even has a diminished hum using battery power only.  Plugging in an input source doesn't change the hum.  I even tried wrapping the whole amplifier in aluminum foil as an rf shield and that didn't change the hum.  The face plate is conductive, so when you touch it the hum intensity is maximum.  Overall, it does amplify, but the quality is so poor that it is unusable.  A real let down considering the Fender name.	-1
Not very good for a practice amp. I think it's a nice novelty item for a Fender fan to stick on a shelf somewhere. It would make a nice knickknack.	-1
Arrived hard as a block of Amber, not softer like other resins I've used.  It may have had a bad batch, I don't know, but I destroyed it trying to see if it was maybe softer under the top layer.  The rosin bar just shattered and I didn't even find any dinosaur DNA or mosquitoes(j/k!).  Was only a $3.00 loss, but worth the learning experience: I now know the difference between good rosin and bad rosin (This is BAD rosin!) and also it has nothing else mysterious inside. Since rosin lasts forever and makes a big difference on sound quality, I just bought the best rosin I could and will never buy this cheap stuff again.	-1
I loved this thing when I got it. Powerful enough to practice in a decent-size room, all the knobs you need, it's adorable and seems durable. Then a week later, there's the sound of something clattering around inside the box. I'm an electronics person, so I went to open it up- and oh wow.  Inside the box, the speaker is held onto the front by a few cheap metal clips screwed into the plastic. These screws are not properly placed so if you move this unit around at all you will eventually break the speaker free and it'll beat around the inside with 4 sharp metal screws stuck to the magnet on the speaker. Beautiful, right? It hurts the sound quality when the speaker is rattling around loosely. It's difficult to reattach the speaker, because the screws broke off the plastic they were embedded into. You'd have to glue it in place since the screws won't hold.  The rest of the unit? Oy. There are loose wires covered in hot glue trying to make sure the loose screws won't short something. If I didn't know any better I'd think this was a 1980s Chinese bodge job trying to rip off a real American brand. A few months later, and miniscule movements of the cords cause cracking and popping because the innards are working loose.  I'm tossing this unit and upgrading to something that's built correctly inside. If you really need a dirt-cheap unit, get someone who knows what they're doing to crack it open and cover the innards with more hot glue to hold everything in place- especially the speaker.	-1
It worked great, but only for a couple of months, and just stopped. Thought it was battery, but it was some problem with hardware. It is cheap, but still...	-1
Wow, it looks cool on the shelf, that's it. Worthless for anything else. Fender has made an overpriced piece of junk with Crap sound, crap electronics, and crap quality control would be better off if they just discontinued this piece of Chinese garbage!!!!!! Very disappointed.	-1
Did no function upon delivery	-1
Along with this amp I ordered the '57 Mini Twin. Both amps are as cute as buttons but it was almost impossible for me to get a clean sound out of either. Plenty of grunge type overdrive but not a fit for me. I did send both amps back!	-1
my complaint for this amp is that it was very hard to get ANY clean sound out of it. It would overdrive like crazy and was plenty loud. I did wind up sending it back for that reason. I was almost tempted to keep it strictly as a decoration because it is very cute. Looks just like it's big brother but decided not to spend the over thirty dollars for a bookend!	-1
The wrong instrument for me. Might work for others. Not criticizing.	-1
I've always used Elixirs.  Saw the good reviews for this set and figured I'd give them a try since they were 60% cheaper.  They didn't feel or sound as good.  Also, they didn't stay in tune well at all.  I have a Taylor 214ce and with Elixirs, I've been regularly surprised by how well those strings stay in tune.  Maybe these strings just don't mesh with my particular guitar, but they failed my test.	-1
Hard to play, not for kids, too frustrating, and I've been playing sax for 25 years. It was not enjoyable and the sound is just ok. Good idea just not executed well.	-1
Broke in less than a month.	-1
Don't know why I keep buying these batter powered amps.  I've tried VOX, Honeytone and now Fender.  This works, but does not sound very good and is overpriced.	-1
Wish I would have paid better attention to the size when comparing to other amps. It works but its cheaply made of plastic and looks like a toy from China. After a few days started giving off a odd sound; more rattling and distorted than when it first came out of the package. Could have bought a "real" amp for the same price but its my fault for over looking details because of the name Fender	-1
a lot of breath required on this.  it has a lot of resistance.  idea is good.  item not made well.  i wish i returned it, because i may never even be able to use it.  i do not recommend this.	-1
cheap crap	-1
I had high hopes for this instrument... but the fact that it uses a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FINGERING SYSTEM from a sax, a recorder, a flute or a clarinet is a deal breaker for me. All of those WWs use a 3&3 sort of fingering system, three fingers of each hand to give a basic scale. The Xaphoon adds the left hand pinkie finger into the mix. (That left hand pinkie has always been an "extra": G#/Ab. Now it's G!!?) This makes all of the patterns you've learned on your woodwinds over the years quite different. If would be no problem to learn a new system (and I'm still debating whether I should return this or not!) but this instrument is NOT an extension of the saxophone despite it's name. You really can NOT practice it instead of the sax as you would be practicing very different fingerings. At best, you could give your embouchure a little more time (this is quite close to some tenor/bari mouthpieces that I have played) but after nearly 50 years of playing the saxophone, I've just about got the embouchure down already. I wanted time to play licks, old tunes, scale patterns. This instrument requires a complete rethinking of these things. Heck, even playing by ear is tough because my fingers want to move the way I'm used to. A nice instrument for what it is... but it IS a NEW instrument, not one that will aid in learning your saxophone.	-1
Do not waste your money, this is a plastic toy not worth the batteries that go in it.	-1
Junk. Works as expected.	-1
there are much better ones out this one is big and bulky	-1
This hold picks but does not like to give them back.	-1
I use this style of pickholder to store picks on the back of the headstock on my guitars. This one is just too wide to fit between the 1st and 6th string tuners.	-1
I have super thin picks and could only fit four of them in here, and only two of my grip tips. Waste of money. I need different thicknesses of picks for different playing styles and this just didn't give me what I needed it for. The picks are also really difficult to get out except for the one on top, and that's only if you fill it completely. The last one or two in were almost impossible to slide out, and the spring inside is very flimsy and doesn't offer any give.	-1
cheaply built	-1
Awful!!! Want my money back!!! Doesn't hold more than 3 picks and it's way too big to carry around....better off keeping your picks in your pocket!! Save your money!!	-1
OK, the tweed covering is nice. The whole thing seems like it was built to last, being a mini and all. That is the only reason this got two stars with me. I play an Epiphone G400 with some upgrades to it and this amp sounds like crap when I turn the volume anywhere past a quarter of the way up. The tone does not make much of a difference on this, the gain just makes the speakers break up faster. I am afraid of blowing the speakers on this out. On a better side of this, when I play with the headphones in it doesn't sound too bad. There is an awful amount of static that comes across the headphones. I've tried two different headphones and I still get the static feedback. I bought this thinking that I could use it to not bother my pregnant girlfriend, sadly it is almost completely unplayable. I will be returning this as soon as possible for a refund.	-1
Dunlop has another pick holder that is better than this one. It has more.of a pick shape holds more picks and does a better job	-1
so i f you want to turn Distor t off, u cannot.  dig?  it s always on...always  if you like hard rock that way u need this tiny gig thingie	-1
difficult to remove picks from unit... not as convenient as I had hoped.	-1
I was surprised at how MINI the amp really is!  When it arrived, I was expecting a bigger amp.  It does work with the battery (that comes with it).  It does have adjustable volume and tone controls, but there is a buzzing sound with the bass notes that are played on my son's guitar.  We bought it for our 11 year old for his birthday and it is okay for him to practice with, but that is all I recommend it for.  At least it will be easy to carry and take with him on any trips.	-1
Meh. I have others I purchased at Guitar Center that I like better.	-1
It's enormous. Regular size picks come out.	-1
it was not in the package....wrong package i recive 1 set of 2 phones..	-1
Didn't work to well	-1
The size of the holder is probably better suited to those old bass style picks... Good idea, but the design isn't great - and if you overfill it it is annoying, but even with just a few in it, sometimes it isn't easy to get them out. So you end up putting picks in there poking out a little. Not sure if it is better than the Dokken-style blue-tac solution, even if you want something more hip and less hair.	-1
*Update 5/4/2016* I've purchased several of these buttons for Schaller locks and they worked swimmingly. The last set I purchased looked right, but didn't fit the locks. I contacted Amazon and they sent another set right away. The replacement set also didn't fit (the circumference was too large). I sent both button sets back and am now on the lookout for some different buttons. I'm no longer able to recommend these for the Schaller system.  I picked these up for use with some Schaller locks that I've had for years. I installed them on a ES-339. They look nice, and work great!	-1
Small telescoping are slips out often on all 3 I purchased -Thought I was upgrading but spent to much on this-I would not recommend to a friend-	-1
I have purchased several sets of these buttons only to find that about 1/3 of them don't fit the Fender lock.  The bad ones are too large and basically jam in the lock.  All of the buttons from the Korean made button/lock sets work fine, but the American made buttons are a crap shoot.  I still haven't been able to find the lock part made in America.	-1
These are not interchangeable with other fender straplocks http://www.amazon.com/Fender-099-0818-300-F-Straplock-Chrome/dp/B003BFYDBS/ref=pd_sim_MI_11?ie=UTF8&refRID=0RQ4P9C3X2W5XZP24W6Y	-1
These are not as useful as I have hoped.  Maybe they would work better for thinner picks but I find that my 1.14 ml tortex picks are hard to grab out of these.	-1
This one looked wood grain and black which I wanted, turns out the one that arrived was all black. Returned.	-1
I really wanted to like this product. I have been using a metal case that holiday lip balm came in, to store my picks. I thought a pick holder would be nicer, but my picks are back in the metal case and this holder is headed for the trash can. It is so hard to get the picks out of this holder, that it isn't worth it. It holds about 5-6 picks, depending on their thickness. I am still in search of a nicer pick holder, but don't waste your money on this one.	-1
It contains your pics, but so does an Altoids mini tin. The adhesive is a one shot deal. I'll throw it in my gear box, but won't buy another one.	-1
Does not dispense picks as easily as I thought - gets stuck constantly.  I ended up storing my picks in a mini Altoids container - works much better.	-1
It keeps making noise and getting loose. It was cheap but I gave up of using after a month. As soon as I find other better fit I will upgrade this post.	-1
This item may be a genuine Gibson part, but it's not an exact replacement for a 1990s era Les Paul Standard.	-1
Be careful with these mic clips the plastic is incredible brittle!  One other note, the mic clips do not detach so you're stuck with the Samson mic clips. You can't use smaller/larger mics with these clips...  still, not a bad option for a '57 on the snare side.	-1
I do not know why these have such a high rating. Don't get them! Check out shure a56d instead or lp claw, you're welcome!	-1
Product is made of low quality plastic parts and fasteners that fall off the drums with standard microphones attached (ie...sm57, audix i5), I had two microphones fall on the drummers heads and then the floor due to these poor items.	-1
It is OK, but it does not compare to the ergo holder. Which you may find here:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Dunlop-Ergo-Pickholder/dp/B0002GLDQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Dunlop Ergo Pickholder</a>. The main problem with this pickholder is that it is very difficult to get your pick out, and it is extremely fragile.	-1
Tried these "oooh" and "ahhh" classic nickel strings. I'm an expert shredder that can do everything the top players can do (you know who they are). Pure nickel strings are terrible. They are incredibly weak with an effect of reducing your pickup output by at least 30%. Do they sound warmer? Sure they do, but at the expensive of such low output? No way. I have several extra packs of these in my home. I'm still looking for them so I can throw them in the trash. I use the regular Ernie Ball power slinkys btw.	-1
I do NOT recommend buying  Ordering strings,having one of them snap while just putting them on; a complete nightmare. A complete waste of 5 dollars and leaves you agitated.	-1
I have very loud drums but to me these nylon brushes seem much to quiet to be of any use. I couldn't even get and sound while recording.	-1
The G and D strings are OK. But the A and E strings are depressed in volume, especially the E string which makes unbearable squeaky sound. Very puzzled as what is really wrong.	-1
This stand broke after a year.  I used it for 40-50 gigs with smaller amps (18 w Fenders and a Victoria Regal II).  But then it stopped working -- the back leg would no longer lock, so the stand couldn't support an amp.  I emailed the company for help and someone called.  She sounded familiar with the problem, and said that they could mail me the needed part, if I could drill-out a rivet, replace the part, and then use a rivet gun to put it together again.  I don't have a rivet gun.  The only alternative was to return the stand to the company on my dime -- about $13 -- so they could decide whether it was a "manufacturing error" such that it was "within warranty."  Even if it was, she said, they would not reimburse me the $13 shipping.  The uncertainty, delay and cost is too much.  I'm throwing the stand away and buying one from another company.  This is not the "ultimate" amp stand.  It's not even a good one.	-1
I have used this a few times but find it a little unstable for any amp larger than a 1-10 or may be a 1-12 sized amp. I use mostly 2-12's which run heavy anyway so I am not sure this is the right protect for me. I do like the built in mike attachment which makes it easy to mike your amp without carrying another stand. Just add a boom or flexible extension and a mike.	-1
I bought one of these from Best Buy a couple of years ago because I lived in an upstairs apartment, and was trying to be a good neighbor by decreasing the noise level caused by any of my amps sitting directly on the floor. This was the only stand they had in stock, and I wish I would have gone next door to Guitar Center. It doesn't feel very stable once you set an amp on it because it only has the one post for support in the back, and you have to make sure the amp's weight is distributed equally on either side of the post rather than just centering it. Also, the knob or whatever the contraption is that is supposed to keep the legs in place failed, and it won't even hold up my little Fender Frontman 25 without collapsing.  It's just a bad design in general, and I'm only giving it two stars because it lasted 2 years instead of failing right away, and I DO like the fact that it folds up into a very compact size, but for $30, do yourself a favor and get something a bit sturdier.	-1
The concept is great, the construction *seems* adequate and the size of the stand is perfect for smaller combos (1x8, 1x10 and 1x12 amps).  HOWEVER, I was using it with a small practice amp rated at half the weight capacity of this stand and the first time I collapsed the stand and went to set it back up, the locking mechanism failed.  The knob on the bottom clicks into the "locked" position and 2 of the legs stay in place, but the 3rd leg just flops around.  3 months in, one "use" of the locking feature and this stand is shot!  I had such high hopes...  NOTE:  I have written the manufacturer about this issue and will post updates if I hear back from them.	-1

UPDATE:  The manufacturer was very slow in responding and says the faulty locking mechanism is a result of "user error"!  Even when directed to the many reviews online citing the same issue with the locking mechanism, they claim that the customers are the problem, NOT the product!  They require the unit be sent back at the customer's expense for "inspection" to determine the cause of failure (i.e. user error vs. manufacturing defect) before guaranteeing any warranty service or replacement, which is entirely at the company's discretion. STAY AWAY!!!	-1
eh	-1
Just ok. certain parts on this seem to never tighten.. Pet peeve of mine Update - stopped using it.	-1
I really don't like the mated finish on the outside, compared to the smooth finish, but it's the function that's the most important.  And it functions accordingly.  Good value, especially with free shipping.  One year of use Update: after about a year of very moderate use, both end pieces (where mic clip is attached) are stripped and no longer will stay position.  I noticed the end pieces are riveted, or just indented, where they are attached to the arm.  Not sure how it can be fixed without drilling a hole and inserting a cotter, clevis pin or something to keep it from spinning.	-1
This device was mated with a stand. Upon receiving both items, the slop/wobble in assembling them together confirmed that this is not going to work. The MS7201B stand works great but it does not mate with this device. Using plumbers tape does not help this problem. Disappointed.	-1
Sadly, I have to revise my previous review, and I *am* going to use something else. I've recently been having problems with the lower screw (that holds the legs in place) slipping. This is not good when you hang your nice guitar up, and come back five minutes later and realize that the legs are flopping all over the place. I don't know what the problem is mechanically, but I've tried screwing the screw in as tightly as I possibly can, and it's still iffy. The stand is about 10-15 years old. Sadly, I think it's going to be relegated to my basement, as I no longer consider it reliable enough to bring on gigs. I've just ordered one of these (based on Amazon reviews) and will be trying it out over the winter:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Ultimate-GS100-Support-Genesis-100-Guitar-Stand/dp/B0002BG2DQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Ultimate  GS100 Support Genesis 100 Guitar Stand</a>  (previous review follows)  This is the best guitar stand I've ever used.  It's sturdy. It folds up very small. It's very stable. It's only one piece.  I'll never use anything else again.	-1
Well made considering the price. However I might as well have bought 2, there's no separate piece that would be in the middle. I might as well scratch my stands before I put them in there. Using a towel for now. Somewhat disappointed.	-1
The length was right, but you're N O T  going to get one, let alone two speaker stands in this bag. maybe a pair of microphone stands, or a mic stand, and a boom, but NOT speaker stands. Speaker stands are just way to big in diameter to go inside of this bag. It should NOT have been advertised as a speaker stand bag. There's just no way you're going to be able to close the bag at all. I hate false, and misleading advertising. It just absolutely frosts my bum when this sort of crime happens to me. I'm reporting this incident to the federal trade commission, and the authorities.	-1
Returned immediately. Too light weight for serious use.	-1
Flimsy compared to my On Stage bag. Not built for professional use. Doubt I would get a dozen gigs out of it. Sent it right back.	-1
Single hole bag - does not protect stands from each other.	-1
Cracked in no time. It was carefully kept in a good humidified room with other stringed instruments, however, the wood cracked in just two months. Not worth the repair.	-1
Not even a good wall hanging. Crappy craftsmanship, no kid will become interested in playing the guitar if they start on this piece of garbage. I sent it right back.	-1
I expected a little more from the reviews I read, but, i am somewhat disappointed. Still my grand son has show he will stick with it and he will get a major upgrade.	-1
Bought this for my 7 year old daughter based on the good reviews. Well, I shouldn't have.  Lesson learned, money wasted. The guitar itself is not very good quality, the tone is terrible, loses tune with the slightest movement -which is not a good feature for a novice learner. I thought the nylon strings would be better for tiny tender fingers, but they are so dull and muted. The thing sounds like a ukulele with a sinus infection. If you have a young one sincerely wanting to pursue music - look on ebay or craigslist for a real guitar, even if used. A little more money would have gone a long way towards a better music learning experience.  I will say as a positive though, the sizing was nice for my daughters small frame. Her fingers could reach the different frets and the guitar waist sat well on her legs. But, it didn't make much difference with the rest of it being shoddy.	-1
This thing is a piece of junk. I know the price is right, and if you're buying it to shut your kid up for a few minutes I'm sure it'll do the trick. But if you expect anything remotely resembling decent sound to come from it, think again. The tuners are crap, the intonation is horrible.  Mine arrived with a sharp dent in the back of the neck and several scuffs on the neck and body. On top of that, the frets were freaking rusted! I don't mean a spot of tarnish here and there, literally 50% of what was supposed to be silver was rust.  I don't know what damp shed this thing came from, but judging by the rusted frets I'm guessing this thing would have warped after a few months in my dry house. I didn't give it the chance and immediately returned it. The only reason it got two stars is because I didn't expect it to be perfect for the price. But this was unacceptable.	-1
I got this guitar for my 5 year old, she loved it, and proceeded immediately to decorate it with Hello Kitty stickers. The guitar looks reasonably well made (for the price) and arrived without major finish flaws; however the tuners can't seem to hold the guitar in tune for more than a few minutes. This makes the guitar less than useful.	-1
Update to this review: Originally I scored it perfect however after five uses the threads have completely stripped out/off. This is for mobile use to it has to be disconnected from the goose-neck. I never over torqued! when I say the threads stripped off, they are not even there anymore. It is as if the threads were painted on or it is made from aluminum foil. The goose-neck threads are fine and I never cross threaded. It may work for someone threading once and leaving it, but not good for mobile use at all.	-1
I figured I'd try a different brad, so I'm concierge this a personal injury self inflicted,  sound is good , clumsily , bulky, cheaply made. Made in china, Have a long way to beat even a cheap Honner,	-1
you get what you pay for.  sounds....eh...ok.  but for 4 bucks, this is what you get!	-1
I should have read the reviews carefully - it's definitely something different, but not sturdy at all, rubber bits come off as you strum, and there are complaints of skid marks on strings and fingers. Ouch! I'm much happier with my Friday the 13th glow-in-the-dark picks - that is an experiment that worked!  And who cares about hard pick sounds anyway? If you want something that sounds like your fingers strumming, why don't you use your fingers?	-1
I bought this as a pick for electric bass but found it was still not hard enough and it lowered my playing volume compared to a standard pick.  I tried it on acoustic guitar and again the volume is a lot lower plus the highs were quieter, too.  I just did not like these and don't see me using them.	-1
I bought one of each Soft, Medium and Hard Wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right, the Hard is as soft as the Soft. They felt exactly the same in fact. The Medium was the hardest out of the bunch. Packaging error? I have no idea. The fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing. So check with what you get.  Sound wise, the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar, making it sound really dull and muted. There is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that I do not think it is idea for strumming. The only reason I can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly, you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead.	-1
I purchased these picks, because I play bass in an alternate punk metal band. We play drop tuning and playing with a plastic or nylon pick creates alot of noise. I was hoping that these picks would stop the pick noise. They don't make that annoying plastic to metal sound, but they are very flexible. I need to have alot of pick speed. These slow me down way to much. The other reviews I read stated that these were like rigid picks, but no they are not. Too bad as i had high hopes.   Good picks if you don't have to tremolo pick, not very good if do have to.	-1
Rubber picks cause drag on nylon strings. They are useless in my opinion. Professor	-1
Was hoping to get a nice soft muted jazz sound but these picks are way too thick and with flatwound strings the sound and feel is awful....I'll stick with my superthin plastic picks and continue muting with my knuckle.	-1
NOOOOOOOOO	-1
These picks do cut pick noise but with an acoustic guitar they wear very rapidly and leave a rubbery residue all over my guitar. I don't like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups, etc. Big disappointment. I'm getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem. Back to the drawing board I go.	-1
I have always thought Behringer made sub-par Pro product, but I had never tried their stuff. I took a chance here, and I am now the owner of a completely melted Carver CM Series power amp. I am contemplating filing a claim for this, but the problem is I have no physical proof. Save yourself the headaches here. Don't ever buy Behringer audio gear. It's the lowest end of "fake" Pro gear you can buy. You get what you pay for in audio gear. Yamaha, ART, DBX are really the top three brands for crossover solutions. Now...to go spend $500> on a $70 mistake ;(	-1
This did not work straight out of the box.	-1
I purchased two of these as I know they are cheap.  One only works once in a while, requires a lot of jiggling etc. to get it spinning.  The other the pin fell out allowing the mirror ball to fall.  Nobody was under it at the time so it did not hurt anybody.  The pin just pulled right out of the motor!  I had a 12" ADJ mirror ball on it at the time.  Concept is good, but construction is too poor to recommend.	-1
IF this item worked it would probably be great, especially for the price. However, neither my husband nor I could get it to work, even after trying multiple things including different batteries.  I'm returning it.	-1
Listen:  There is overwhelming negative feedback for this item all over Amazon.com.  If you hang anything larger than a feather from the hook, the motor strips out and is rendered completely useless.  Specs say up to 12" disco ball...  You MIGHT be able to get away with a 4" if you're lucky.  Sometimes inexpensive means low cost...this one means CHEAP.  Do Not Buy.	-1
Started breaking apart after one use.  Stripping out, falling apart, doesn't fit easily around hoop, and doesn't look like the one pictured.	-1
I put this on a floor tom, and it held well a few times, but the plastic gripper thing slides off the hoop now.  It seems to be at the wrong angle.	-1
I bought a few of these drum mic clips to help speed up the break-down process after recording live bands. I was using cheap, hard plastic mic clips that secure firmly to the drum rim but are dificult to remove. And there's nothing I hate more than being in the way of the drummer when he's trying to remove his kit. I was hoping the screw-on clamp on these clips would be quicker and easier to attach and remove.  I was wrong.  It takes forever to unscrew the clamp enough to fit over the rim, then you have to screw them tight... but not too tight. I've used these clips a grand total of three times. I've already had two clips fall off because they weren't tight enough and one broken because I tightened it too far.  I've gone back to the cheap plastic clips (which haven't fallen off or broken once in over a year of use) and hold these in my kit as emergency replacements.  I suppose they would work in a studio setting, where you have lots of time to set up and adjust your drum  mics, but for my purposes - fast and cheap recording of live punk bands - these clips were a waste of money.	-1
This item needs improvement, its ok if you use the middle of the bar for the heavy condenser mikes and the side just to hold something like an sm58 in a holder, not with an extra bar, if you need to move you stand around, don't buy this one. I use it stationary only.	-1
It's hard to trust your expensive microphones on this thing.  The left and right thread-ins never lock into place leaving the microphone swinging left/right with a light push.  You'll be fussing with it a bit to get it right...	-1
I foolishly ordered this mike splitter because my needs were quite basic and this was the cheapest dual mike mount I could find.  I soon learned what a mistake that was.  As another reviewer pointed out, it is extremely difficult and frustrating to point microphones exactly where you want them to be because the mount has threaded instead of smooth holes.  So you cannot simply place the mike clip where you want it and then crank on the tightening knob, because the microphone studs are not threaded the full length of the shaft.  This can be worked around by using washers/spacers, but finding thin washers in this size is difficult.  The bigger problem is that the cast mount is attached to the brass stud (what your mike stand screws into) by nothing more than friction.  It is easily popped off, which can send your microphones hurtling to earth.  This is exacerbated by the pivot which, though it seems like a good feature to have, is actually a disaster waiting to happen because it cannot be sufficiently tightened and with a couple of reasonably heavy mikes, the thing wants to flop around.  This is probably the worst device of its type.  I strongly recommend buying a different product.	-1
I bought two of these bars. I have had many problems with them. They are very hard to tighten at an angle - in fact impossible to do without pliers. Also, some mikes can only be attached to certain posts - the knobs at the bottom will not tighten to the bar. I would not recommend this bar. On the other hand, the price was about the same as it would cost me to ship back, and thus I didn't return them. I would recommend using a sturdier stereo bar.  Update: After I removed one of the mikes, the side bars have now bent. They are not as thick as the center bar.	-1
Lousy product. I almost hate it (and trying not to). The design just doesn't make any sense. I bought it because there really isn't any other low cost alternative.	-1
good concept but does not work with some Mic clips the clips don't screw on the bar well.  the clips should all face the same direction when tightened but they don't some are off angle so that you can't place the mic in the holder properly.	-1
Move when playing	-1
I tried it for iPad. It kinda wobbles up and down. It has a light strip of metal without a bracing design so it flaps up and down when something heavy is attached to the end such as my iPad.  I only recommend it for something light weight.  There's better ones out there. See my review on the music stand. That comes with a solid extension arm...	-1
Bends way to easy..... had to get a replacement, and it ways the  same, don't put any pressure on it or it will bend every time.	-1
Really inferior quality. All 3 of the cables started to malfunction within a few uses. I've had/used other coiled cables (Radio Shack) that have held up. These didn't.	-1
OK, it was cheap (nine bucks at the time), the design looked good and sensible, and it seemed a perfect solution to a real need. I bought it without hesitation. HOWEVER(!), once hooked up, I was very surprised how flimsy it is. I have a 13" gooseneck, a light condenser mic and small shock-mount on it. At the slightest movement of the mic stand this attachment flaps up and down like crazy and will continue this way for a something like a minute if not stopped by hand. Obviously, any small bump into the stand will once again set this off. Using it at home, I've gotten away with not touching the stand while recording by being very careful, but obviously this unit is far from ideal. Since then, I've gotten another sidemount boom from this same brand, and though I haven't really put through its paces yet, this other unit is rock solid and far more adjustable and reliable, AND only costs a few bucks more (On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom). For anyone considering this product, I HIGHLY recommend bypassing this one and forking out just a few more bucks for the On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom. You will be far far happier.  Cheers!	-1
Flimsy conduction...after 6 months, mine have come loose.	-1
It "adapts" but is is really noisy when using it. It is very cheaply made too. I'd probably look somewhere else if I was going to buy again.	-1
As stated in other reviews, this endpin tip is not for a bass. Mine broke very quickly.	-1
I purchased the M-Audio FAST TRACK from Amazon because it had SESSON software.  I received the unit without SESSON and I sent it back.  Amazon sent out a second unit (no SESSON software) and a company called Austin Bazaar sent out a unit (no SESSON software) I kept the Amazon unit and I sent back the Unit to Austin Bazaar (unopened) and todate I never have received my $99.00 back from Austin Bazaar.  I went to Best Buy and purchased the SESSON USB for $49.00 (with SESSON)& M-Audio Support sent a burned copy of SESSON.  Bottom Line after spending $240.00 SESSON didn't work on any of my three computers.  I bought Calkwalk Music Composer 4 from Calkwalk for $39.99 & it works fine. A total $280.00 learning curve.	-1
Only for beginners not for anyone who needs a sturdy pedal. Too lightweight	-1
Giving this just a 2 star rating as I detest sellers that don't show enough photos or 3 of the same photo. In this case, the 1/4" jack and cord are not shown... these momentary switches come with straight plugs and 90 degree strain relief plugs.  This one is STRAIGHT.   Other than that, it appears to be all metal not plastic has some weight to it.  On the bottom ( also no photo) the whole bottom has a rubber mesh that appears to be well glued and soft enough to keep it from sliding as much as is possible. Also not shown in the photo is a little SWITCH by the cords entrance to the switch...it probable is to change if from normally open to normally closed, as some keyboards and electronics vary in what they need or do when this pedal is pressed....so, this is good.  MORE PHOTOS SELLERS !!!!!!	-1
The padding on the bottom, which keeps the pedal from sliding around, came off after minimal use.  I would like to see the pedal be more sensitive, as it seems I have to place all my weight on the pedal to get it to respond.  *****I really like M-Audio***** However, I will not buy another one of their pedals.	-1
I got this pedal for my new M-audio Keystation 61es. From the time a felt the pedal I knew trouble was coming... out of the box, it feels really sturdy, a bit TOO sturdy and playing for he first time works your calves well. Within about two hours of jamming on my midi controller, one of the screws fell off at the side... wow! what a disappointment :(. Luckily i THINK i have a plan... the screws determine how soft the pedal would be but they will keep falling out because there is nothing to keep it sturdy on the inside... i'll try to find some knots to suit and install them on the inside to keep the screws in place. this should help but I haven't tried it yet... guess I'll have to wait to see...	-1
I was torn between going for a more expensive realistic piano sustain pedal or this cheapie looking pedeal. I just needed a sustain pedal for some piano and synth work.  For the time being I am happy with it. This is just a basic sustain pedal.  It's either all on or all off. In other words, there is no control of how much sustain you can put on it, which I wish I had known before I bought it, but it works pretty well and it's pretty solid. You get what you pay for.  Update9/2010  This thing hasn't seen a whole lot of abuse or misuse, or even use for that matter. So it was a mystery why the rubber gripping just came right off after a matter of weeks. Oh well, not a big deal to me. It has either sat in a box (most of the time actually) or been on the floor when I need it. It finally crapped out on me this week. It just won't work at all. Tried it on 3 different keyboards, 2 different programs (it had previously worked on everything) and now it just doesn't register. Disappointing cause I was in the middle of composing. I thought maybe it was a software thing. Nope. Did all I could think of. Nothing. It's a pretty simple little thing so I tried opening it up, everything looked fine (Cheaply constructed, I mean it's a damn little PIN that is the switch and not an actual SWITCH) Even went as far as to replace the cable and solder a new one in myself. Still didn't work!  For as long as I've had it (about a year and half) it really hasn't seen a lot of use and only in my home studio. I'm a guitar player so I mainly stick to that, so I was upset when this thing just up and dies when I have a cheap $30 distortion pedal I've had since I was 13 that still works. I mean, I know it was cheap but, really?	-1
First I must state I did not purchase this from amazon, but rather a local music store. This product has a fatal flaw, in that it lacks double holes on the bottom finger position which makes it impossible to play the low F#. Half holing does not work, as between a flat g and a sharp F the tone breaks into a squeak. This also cripples the third register where the "half hole" is needed for F# again, as well as G, A, and Bb.  Clearly the intended purpose of this instrument is for a very young child who is too small for a soprano, who won't be playing chromatic, or using the upper register. The cheap YRS24b soprano, while not as nice sounding as the yrs302b, deserves the title of being a "real" instrument. This yrn22b however does not.  Spend the money for a yrn303b. or get another brand.	-1
I am disappointed with the durability of this pedal. This is the second one I have purchased for my son and it has stopped working like the first one. This one lasted longer than the 1st, which lasted a few months. It works great when it works but, the reliability isn't there. My son was on a great gig and it just stopped working. He has other M-Audio products but, our confidence with their products is weakening.	-1
I have been using this pedal for almost exactly a year. It constantly walks away form me on a carpet. Although this is easily remedied with some rubber feet, over the course of the year the amount I've had to press the pedal to engage sustain has continuously increased. I now have to press the pedal to the floor and lean on it for sustain to engage. These things should last YEARS... not barely a year.	-1
Despite its heavy duty appearance ... this pedal barely lasted me 3 months. I gig 3-5 times a week so it is constantly getting moved ... but gently moved and stored in a hard shell case. The wire coming out of the back of the pedal has caused it to sometimes work - sometimes not work. Usually M-Audio stuff is top notch. I have older and cheaper looking sustain pedals that still operate. I was disappointed in the M-Audio SP-2.	-1
DO NOT PURCHASE! THIS SQUEAKS! After maybe 2 months of use, this pedal now completely squeaks every time you press down on it. The pedal is also harder to press down on than a regular piano pedal, and the spring is too strong to simulate real pedal action.  NOISY + HARD PEDAL FEEL = DON'T BUY  FYI, I've been playing piano over 20 years, but then again, I guess this was on me for purchasing the most popular pedal instead of really doing my research =(	-1
I have purchased this item a few times because it feels pretty good and is so affordable. Unfortunately, they all eventually have a bad connection at the place where the cable meets the pedal base. I would purchase a different brand and/or spend a little more money if you want something that lasts.	-1
Bought this for Yamaha M08 keyboard pedal replacement. Unfortunately, it did not work on M08.	-1
Worked fine for a few months.  I alway put back in it's box when I moved it to practice and gigs.  but at my last gig, it stopped working,  I did get some sustain if I put my entire weight on it and found the sweet spot, but that's not practical.  I took it apart, but mechanically, everything looks fine, and I'm not engineer, so it's dead to me.  Too late to return it, just won't buy this brand again.	-1
Absolutely awful product. Breaks after 6 months or after moving. Had two of them, will not buy another one.	-1
2 months in, squeaks. Buy something else.  RMA? Sure but you'll pay for shipping. Casio makes a nicer one. Buy that.	-1
Something is wrong with the wiring of my pedal. When NOT pressed it is on full sustain all the time, and once depressed it becomes muted. Totally opposite from the way a sustain pedal is supposed to work.	-1
Broke in a gig after I purchased it in a weeks time. Very embarrassing.	-1
Squeak squeak.. so annoying. Pay more and buy a better pedal	-1
Stopped working in 4 months time with light to normal use.  I looked up the M-Audio Customer service number and stayed on hold for 45 mins with no response.  There are no manuals or warranty information online.	-1
PLASTIC PLASTIC PLASTIC PLASTIC!!! Works though.	-1
I've had 3 or 4 of these pedals and even with light use, they have all stopped working at some point. But before they died they functioned perfectly. Nice pedal, but apparently not made to last.	-1
dead after 2wks. But awesome while it worked.	-1
Doesn't work well with my Yamaha keyboards.  Boo!	-1
Seems like a good product. Not much for documentation or instruction on operation though which leaves a lot of hit and miss to get it to work the way I want. Better support = More Stars	-1
If you have win7, it might be okay, but it does approximately squat in win8.  In the company's forums, it is the general consensus among users that these cards are so cheap now because they are useless, and the company is soon to come out with a new line. Win8 has been out for quite some time, and still no fully functional drivers.  These cards ARE more than 10 years old. In fact most new machines don't even have a slot to accept this card.  Think about it.	-1
I have three audio interfaces (USB and Firewire), but wanted a card with no Preamp built in to it as I use a higher end one. So bought this card, yet it is worthless for recording professional music.  The input is so low, no matter the variable. I have separate Mic Preamps and Hardware compressors with gain controls, balanced cables and the like.... still card signal is too low.  Avoid this low end product as it is an expensive gaming card now.	-1
I've had travel guitars before and this is the worst one. My Martin backpacker was much better to play, better made and better sounding. This Washburn pos is absolutely the worst sounding guitar I've ever played. It sounds like a cardboard can inside a paper bag. Lifeless, muffled, terrible. Also awful to play. Don't buy this. It has super cheap tuners. Washburn should never put their name on this piece of junk from China. Really really bad. I played it once for a few minutes and probably will never pick it up again.	-1
I won't go into excessive detail on here. Plenty of other folks have given much better, more detailed reviews.  We were pretty disappointed with the overall sound of this guitar. It sounds like a children's guitar when playing it... We changed out the strings and added some very thin light ones to it and adjusted the neck a little bit. Did not do much for the overall sound, but did help keep it from going out of tune as easily.  After reading the reviews, I really had much higher expectations out of this guitar. If not for the size, and need for compact instruments while traveling on the road all year long, this would have been sold within the first week of owning it.  I would definitely say to adjust your expectations of this sounding rather childish when you play.	-1
After reading some reviews I thought I would give this guitar a try. It is such a good looking little guitar and I really wanted to like it, but mine had fret buzz right out of the box and just did not have an attractive sound, more like a banjo than a guitar. Of course , for the price, I'm not sure what I expected. It's great for practicing chords and picking and such, but not too good for listening. I ended buying a baritone Uke for the same price that sounds awesome and is even smaller, so that is an option to consider if ya don't mind using 4 strings rather than 6. Anyway, I definitely would pass on this one and maybe buy a parlor size good sounding guitar or a Uke if you really want to go small.	-1
I thought I could take the smell. I couldn't. Otherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad sounding. The case is nice too, but everything smells like the Chinese rubber smell at Harbor Freight Tools. (sulfur?) I tried airing it out for a week with no success.  If you have no sense of smell, get one.	-1
I purchased the Washburn Rover to take it sailing/motorcycling, etc. and received it a couple of days ago.  To be Frank (or, I'll be John if you want)this is really a child's guitar.  I think you could get one at Walmart for 2/3d's the price that would produce the same sound quality as this. The action is set very high though it does have a nice wide fingerboard and overall exceptable construction for what it is.  Also, you've probably read the reviews about the intense chemical smell from the straps.  Believe me, all true.  Don't know what this is all about but...wow.	-1
Needed a travel guitar to practice while sitting in hotel rooms on business. I wasn't all that concerned about sound quality. Mainly wanted something that was playable and had a decent neck and string action.  Very disapointed. String action was so high I consider this thing completely unplayable. Tried adjusting truss rod and it helped, but still very unplayable.  Sound was about what I expected, not going to play a concert with it, but good enough for practice use.  Nice case and accessories, and a great idea. But too bad the guitar itself is unusable and unplayable. I'm amazed at the good reviews, so I can only assume that most of these folks are not actual guitar players or have no experiance with anything other than a walmart guitar..  Returned and decided to look at other options instead...	-1
I read all the reviews before purchase. However I have no idea how anyone who actually plays guitar could have rated this product so high?? It is indeed possible I got recieved a bad copy, but I don't think so. I wanted to try one out before buying at a local music shop and they chuckled and said... no we don't carry them... I think I know why now.  I wanted something I could travel and take on a plane with me while on business. After reading the reviews it seemed this might be exactly what I wanted. I was not worried about the sound quality. I simply wanted something that was playable and that I could use to practice a little on the road. Scales etc..  The product it isn't terribly built, and there is a general appearances that some thought went into the design of this, but quite frankly I found this thing completely unplayable. It has a truss rod adjustment so I was able to get the bow out of the neck (the truss rod was not adjusted at the factory), however the action was so high I couldn't actually play a chord past about the 3rd or 4th fret. Even trying open chords it was.. .cumbersome.. So the decision to return was easy.  I suspect with some work I could file down the nut and bridge and to potentially get the action low enough to make this playable. However I decided to return this and not waste any more of my time.  I have read glowing reviews and I can only conclude that they were planted by the manufacture or the folks who bought don't really play guitar. Again I don't care about the tone (a bit like a Ukulele which isn't very good) but that isn't my issue it is the playability, and from that perspective this is useless. Get some strings and a wash board, you will have more success.  For people who actually play guitar and need something playable, there are some other travel options out there (more expensive) such as short scale guitars (baby Taylor, Martin) and some fullscale oddball travel guitars. I guess I'll have to investigate those..	-1
I personally found this keyboard to match my needs very well. I thought the keys velocity was more than adequate. If you are an experienced piano player you should be able to control the velocity well enough with the feel of these keys.  UPDATE: This started to bug out and send continuous midi which makes me have to restart the unit frequently in order to reset the keyboard... not super awesome if u ask me.	-1
Hear me out in writing this review -- I can see many other reviewers warmly endorse this product.  I ordered this and was surprised that the product has no AC adapter. That's right-- if you want to power this from an outlet rather than USB, you must order the adapter separately.  Let me explain some technology basics. There are two ways to "interface" a MIDI controller with your computer.  1) USB. This sends power and MIDI data down a single cable. It is high-latency (meaning it adds several fractions of a second to the keyboard input) and requires software to correct for this. This correction is pretty effective and most hobbyist users may not notice this latency.  2) A MIDI cable. This sends data over a type of data cable that has been around since the 1980s. This data cable has zero latency. It also requires that the keyboard be powered by a wall adapter.  For $200, it is fair to expect both options #1 and #2 out-of-the-box.  Few music professionals who depend on MIDI for a mission-critical application would use option #1. If you control instruments in a pro studio environment, you can notice the MIDI latency issues of USB. If you control instruments live environment in front of 100 or 30,000 people, you want separate power and data cables for trouble-shooting. Either way, professionals mostly go with option #2.  So forgive me if I purchased this with the expectations of a serious music professional. If I was a hobbyist (who did not have a tremendous amount of other gear sitting around) -- and I just wanted a quick and adequate MIDI controller to plug into my MacBook -- I might give this 5 stars.  Unfortunately, I bought this expecting to quickly get going in a professional studio environment using methods that have been industry-standard for almost 30 years. I was stopped dead in my tracks by the lack of a power adapter.  I would give this zero stars with no apology. M-Audio needs to take professionals seriously. Shave 50 cents off the profit margin and include an AC adapter with this keyboard. It has been a royal waste of my time and slap in my face. Time is money -- In the time it takes me to re-box and return this, I could easily have made the extra money it would have cost to include an AC adapter.	-1
5 Stars if you going to buy this as decoration. I got this and inside has rust in it, which means, someone used it before... Glad I took a inspection first.	-1
quality seems o.k. and it arrived in plastic. My daughter was given another kazoo for Christmas which looks to be the same quality and in a box....which was a better presentation for the amount of money.	-1
my kid like it but itmake them got sore throat ! :)	-1
Very poor instrument, more then expected.	-1
Metal has already come apart.  Prefer the cheap plastic ones to the cheap metal ones.  But this is a very pretty kazoo.	-1
I bought this kazoo and two cheaper Honer plastic kazoo. The plastic ones sound so much better that I am thinking about returning this, despite the small money involved, just out of disappointment. It is that bad. The membrane is barely responsive and the attempts to sing in this thing are just frustrating. Instead of being fun it just makes you look ridiculous and feel tired.	-1
Each day I have to reboot my machine because the audio outputs either stop working or start to pick up a lot of noise/static.  Searching around the internet seems to indicate M-Audio drivers for OS X are not to be held in high regard.  If you havea Mac, I would think twice about buying M-Audio audio interfaces.  (For the record, I have OS X 10.4.11).	-1
Unfortunately, I have an Intel Mac. I researched this item extensively prior to purchase and nowhere does it tell you that it has trouble with Intel Macs. The only driver on the M-Audio site is from early 2006 and does not support Tiger 10.4.11 which is what I am running. I installed the CD-ROM that came in the box, but the unit would not show as being hooked up to my Mac and I could not use any of my Pro Audio programs with it. I couldn't even open the M-Audio control panel on my computer. I then went and installed the most recent Intel driver from the M-Audio site and it got a me a little further; I could now open the control panel so that it could tell me that the device isn't plugged in. All of the lights are on on the device but it is not hooking up right to my computer somehow. Me thinks this is an Intel issue.  Of course now when I go to research this issue I find all the Intel problem reports that I didn't see somehow before I bought this item. Bottom line, this is an outdated item (it is a few years old and has not been updated) and it has outdated software support. I'm not sure if just the latter is the only problem or if the two issues work in concert with each other. I wish I still had my G5 so I could try this thing out and confirm that it really is an Intel issue, but I don't. I just have my 2.2GHz Santa Rosa MacBook Pro.  I am returning this to Amazon and now I will have to start looking for a mobile audio solution again. I knew this thing was too good to be true when I saw the price, and I should have gone with my gut.	-1
The HA4700 High-Power 4-Channel Headphone Amplifier was my first purchase from Behringer and I'm glad that this device is just used for musicians to listen to playbacks for overdubbing in my home studio.  My amp was noisy with some individual pots much noisier than others and a low background hiss throughout all outputs.  I only use it when I need more headphone distribution, otherwise I'll grab the signal off the board and send it into the tracking room. Clearly this piece of equipment was designed and built for those who want something that looks pro, but costs less... so, quality control problems and cheap components are what you get.  I won't purchase another item from this manufacturer, unless it comes highly recommended.  At some point, I'll probably replace the HA4700 with an ART HeadAmp Pro 6 which I've been able to check out at a friends studio and which seems superior for the price. The PreSonus HP60 looks promising, too although it's considerably more expensive.	-1
not good	-1
Range wasn't bad at all but sounds like your in a tin can. Very bad sound quality I will just use them for speeches at Wedding receptions.	-1
This I am not too impressed with used it one time and lost one Mic second time couldn't get either one to work so went back to wired mics	-1
Don't waste your money on this wireless mic setup.. Its cpeap plastics, breaks quickly and the range is more like 10ft. If your looking for a great non expensive wireless system that works great and provides great coverage and sound quality save up and spend over ,$100 for a quality wireless system. If you want even better then be ready to spend $400+ on a top of the line wireless mic set up.	-1
Out of using this wireless microphone system, I get feedback with the sound not turned up, and also, you can't say anything right over the mic when speaking to the crowed. Horrible mics, get a shure microphone. They are better, and they don't give you feedbacks than this crappy system here.	-1
The product was a total piece of crap. It has a 1/4 inch jack which is only mono. the microphones create huge feed back. the mics can be broken by dropping it a foot. this is good for nothing.	-1
Tried saving a little money on some cheap microphones.... I took them out of packaging, put batterys in, turned on and after 2 minutes with them, I put them back in the packaging and sent them back.  Worse Microphones ever.  Dont even waste your money.  They cut in and out and ALOT of STATIC	-1
I purchased these to use for our church group event at my house, and based on my experience with them, Amazon shouldn't even allow them to sell on their website. The range is very poor. I can't even get them to go 8 feet in a wall-less (?) room without getting fuzzy and breaking up. Plus, when you get out of range, in order to restore the signal, you have to go all the way back to the receiver and physically TOUCH the bottom of the mic to the antenna. One of the two antenna receivers broke while I was putting it away, and I'm not careless with my stuff.  So, trust me, you won't get any good use out of this model. Naxa is not a good brand. If you're looking for something cheap, but good, go with Nady. If you don't have too much of a price limit, go with Shure or Audio-Technica. You'll enjoy those brands much more.	-1
I thought well $16 what do I got to lose, the answer is $16 total waste of money. Awful quality, terrible feedback is ever couple seconds, unbearable. Don't buy this	-1
you get less than what you pay for...  this thing is garbage..save your money DO NOT BUY THIS...you will regret it!!!	-1
I bought this particular fogger because it was an inexpensive 700 watts and could cover a high number of cubic feet per minute. Paired with good fog juice, it actually works pretty well and will pump out tons of fog with the push of a button. I even got an American DJ Fogger Timer and it works well with this unit. However, there are some problems with this particular model. For starters, it leaks fluid. A lot of fluid. Don't bother filling the tank all the way; the fluid will just leak out and make a mess of things. Secondly, after you stop pressing the button, it seems like some of the fluid in the tubes will leak onto the heating element, so you'll see some fog periodically come out every now and then.  Pros: -Inexpensive -Produces lots of fog  Cons: -Leaks fluid -Fog will come out when you're not pushing the button  While I do like this fogger, I think next time I will instead invest in a better fogger as the leaking is a huge problem, especially if it's around other electrical equipment (like lighting)	-1
As soon as I set it up there was an issue with the sound not operating with the crossover. I tried to call seller many times over 10 days and I even called BBE ( MFG.) and no one to answer because mailbox full and could not even leave a message. When I bypassed the Crossover it worked just fine. I know it was the Holidays but this happened a week before and all thru the holidays I had to deal with not one returned phone call. I was not happy and would I recommend this to someone??? Just for the fact that no one returned my call and the fact that I could not even leave a message at BBE is enough to give this product a big fat zero.	-1
Had I read the description more carefully, I would have noticed this aspect of this strap.  Because I play only acoustic guitars, I do not want to use any accessory that might scratch or damage the surface of my solid wood instruments - including the new Guild that I purchased this strap for.  It looks great - tough and honest. However, the metal studs are a rather serious design flaw that render it a bad choice for acoustic use. Maybe for electric guitar players who want to add a touch of metal to their metal. My own fault for not reading more carefully before ordering. Don't make the same mistake!	-1
Way too short for an acoustic.  I'm 5'10" of average build and it's about 6" too short, and that's on a Taylor 110, which is not a huge guitar either.  My fault, I should have double checked the length before i ordered it.  But then again, I've been playing for  40 years and never bought a strap that's too short, so I just didn't think about it.  Other than that, it's a nice strap, and the leather has a different look on each side, one side is much more distressed leather look than the other.  I guess I'll rig some kind of extension.	-1
This feels like one of those products that someone designed, but never bothered to actually use. It looks and feels like a rawhide boot lace. Very stiff and hard. I applied some leather conditioner and tried working it in by hand, thinking it would be better after it was broke in a little bit, but no. While it did soften up a little, it became a shedding mess (like others mentioned). The "blasted" texture that appears to be glued on, balled up and flaked off such that it looks absolutely awful. It's also impregnated with a reddish colored dye that will run and get everywhere if you perspire. I imagine it's there to color the thing so it looks less like the sole of a shoe and more like a quality leather strap...which it really isn't. A few reviewers used words like "buttery soft" and "fine piece of jewelry", but the one I got is far from fine or buttery. Maybe I got a bad one that was left out on a street somewhere in the blazing sun for a few months, but even then, it's a glued together piece of rawhide, nothing fine or quality about it.	-1
Very short. I'm only 5'9" and I am on the last/longest option and it is too small. Does not look like picture either. It is painted to look distressed vs actually being distressed. quality of leather appears to be very good.	-1
I usually love Planet Waves stuff, so when I saw good reviews of this I was really looking forward to getting it. Unfortunately, this doesn't match up to the quality of other Planet Waves products. The leather is pretty thin and just feels like it's fake. The "Blasted" finish just looks dull. From the picture, I thought it would have a more "lived in" feel and look. As others have mentioned the holes in the ends are far too small to use with strap-locks so it's necessary to trim the leather away to make the hole larger if you're gonna  use strap-locks. Unfortunately for me, I made the holes larger before I realized that I could have just returned it to Amazon. So, I'll keep it as a back-up strap, but I don't like it much.	-1
Too Short	-1
This is the newest resident of the Box of Pitiful Things That I Purchased as an Overly-Enthusiastic New Guitarist. It's uncomfortable, and after removing/putting it on the guitar a few times, it will inevitably begin plotting the subterfuge that will end in your favorite guitar taking a slow-motion, head-stock-down nosedive, with the accompaniment of dramatic lute music.	-1
The material used is fine.  The looks are fine.  The length is horrible.  This is too short for most adults that play guitar.  It felt like I was holding my guitar around my neck instead of off my shoulders.  I attached it by the longest way possible and it was well short of what I could use.  To me this was a worthless purchase.  I just tucked it into a drawer and it will sit there and not be used again.	-1
Broke in the first day that I got it. Terrible.	-1
This was my first professional microphone purchase. After doing tons of research and talking to two friends that are in the recording industry I decided to go with an XLR mic and this one because of reviews and recommendations.  After ordering and getting the Mic I was unable to get it to work using an M-Audio audio interface which I assumed was probably a driver or firmware issue. After spending a week updating/downgrading drivers and motherboard firmware on my Windows 7 64bit computer and also testing on my wife's Windows 10 laptop I ended up ordering a phantom power supply and buying another audio interface from a local brick and mortar store. This still did not get the mic working. I spoke with an Audio professional and he walked me through a few hours of trouble shooting and again still was not able to get it working.  So after spending almost 300$ on top of the 100$ microphone I ended up RMAing it back as well as the other equipment I bought and went with a Samson C03U which worked immediately out of the box and cost me 90$ without any extra equipment. I'm sure it was probably just a fluke but it left such a sour taste in my mouth I didn't want another one.	-1
Construction is good, but this is the worst condenser microphone I've ever worked with sound-wise. We tried it against other condenser microphones at around the same price and it just didn't compare. It isn't that it seemed faulty, it just seemed dull and lifeless.	-1
So strange this happens on a brand new set of strings. This brand used to be trusted by me.	-1
I wanted to like these strings for slide playing, but they just didn't do anything for me and I swapped out the low strings for regular ones right away. D'Addario is a great string maker, but this set didn't speak to me. The wound strings sounded subdued and didn't sound right with the slide. YMMV.  I do use their reso strings and like them.	-1
Strings sound dull and not as smooth as I had hoped.  Took them off after a couple of hours and went back to Elixir.	-1
A disappointment. Flat sounding, back to Gibson Bright Wires.	-1
3rd and 4th strings were actually rough! I used Gibson flats for years, and they were mirror-smooth..guess I'll have to go back to them..	-1
Purchased these for a new Heritage H-575 arch top.  A few months later, the high E string unwound from the ball end.  Overall good strings, good sound -- this set simply didn't last very long.  I will replace with 12s however.  For me the 11s felt a little loose.  The 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box.  I have 12s on an Epiphone Joe Pass model.  I'll be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s.	-1
Tone-wise, Chromes can't hold a candle to Thomastik-Infeld Jazz Swing strings. I suppose that is somewhat forgivable since Chromes cost less than half what Thomstik-Infeld Jazz Swing string cost. However, what puts me completely off them, to the point that I'd rather use GHS Precision flatwounds if I couldn't find Thomastik-Infelds, is that they are very slippery under my fingers. I don't get the same kind of tactile connection with the strings that I get with every other brand of flatwounds I've every used.	-1
I bought 4 sets of these. The wound 3rd string broke on every set in a short time. One 1st string broke when I was stretching it.	-1
Very disappointed in these strings. Round wound, very twangy. Had bass at luthier and he recommended them, but he said he was disappointed in this set. They look like they are wrapped with bronze, not nickel. Now I know why they were so cheap.	-1
Stick with Ernie Ball.	-1
After trying many brands of strings, this brand wound up being my least favorite. The tone is very light and hollow. If you are looking for a good set of light strings, try earthwood frailing, or spring the extra bucks for the Elixr. They will give you a much healthier sound.	-1
Had to wait a week for them even though they were "prime". D'Addario really drug their feet with processing for ONE pack of strings. When I finally got them they looked and felt great but the D string broke before I even started tuning it up to standard tuning. Now I have three new shiny bright strings and one dingy old one that's dead. I would rate 5 stars had it not been for the dead on arrival string snap.	-1
These are okay, but after purchasing a set of these and a set of Rotosounds for my Hagstrom, the Rotosounds sound better, have more even tension string-to-string, and better low-end response, plus they come packaged in separate envelopes which makes it easier to install without getting the strings mixed up (d'addario packs them all in one bag which they pretend has to do with being green, but it's really just to save money...the plastic doesn't break down anyway and isn't as easily recycled in most areas.	-1
These are not designed to fit a 301/4 scale bass. They were short on the small diameter size by about an inch. Therefore, the strings buzzed at the first fret because the diameter was too small at the nut. Don't buy them, I wasted $16.00	-1
Through my Ampeg bass amp, the low E string gets distorted when you push the bass control above 7, and the upper 3 strings sound kind of plain.	-1
Ordered from Eat My Beats, Inc. I must have a deffective set or something because I did get a refund after it. I put my bass strings on just enough to where I don't need to hold them on and my bottom string just snapped. I have never had that happen before and will not buy these gauges again from this brand.	-1
They changed the length of the string by shortening them by a fraction of an inch and they barely fit on my nut. This last set actually routed out a groove out of my nut causing my string to buzz terribly while playing. I had to buy a new nut and change the scale of my strings after 6 years of no problems. and 3 different basses.	-1
I guess the size (length) of the strings have made the strings not as bright sounding and they go dead faster. I have played on them for a couple hours for exactly 4 days and they are dead. WIth the previous D'Addarios, I could play for almost a month. straight.	-1
do not buy this pack if you're expecting a 3 sets of strings. what arrived was a single set (6 strings). unfortunately I was in a position where i needed them right away and had to go ahead and slap them on the guitar.	-1
this is a first time for me I ordered two packs of these string and both of the #12 strings broke at the ball when I put them on ?	-1
It was not as described in the website. I used it for one day and the strings were already corroded. Don't buy it if you are looking for a corrosion resistant set.	-1
D'Addario XL and the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad strings! I've played guitar for over 20 years and have used all kinds of electric guitar strings. I thought I'd buy these "cheap" strings for practice, and use a higher end (NYXL) for gigs. Whoa, big mistake. Do yourself a favor and skip this low end product altogether. There's a reason they're cheap, and I'm thoroughly convinced now it's because they're made of the cheapest material known to mankind. After about an hour's worth of use, these things are absolutely toneless. These XL strings, after an hour of playing, sound worse than my NYXL strings that are 2 weeks old with more than 24 hours of bending, slashing, and strumming. Straight up, the XL is garbage. Period.	-1
I've played EXL110 for years and loved them, using hundreds of sets, but I think something most have changed with the production.  I've had three high E strings come unwound at the ball end in the past month.  All three were on gigs and now I'm stressed a set won't even make it through a whole show.  Come on D'Addario.	-1
I am really getting disappointed with these strings I never had a problem. My Hi E strings are breaking in the middle (between tuners and nut) not at a stress or contact point and (2) strings in the last week have come unraveled down at the bridge end, one on a ES335 the other on a Telecaster with a Babicz bridge, the string doesn't even have a turn in that bridge. I regularly bend a whole step not much more. I'm going to contact the company about this and I don't think these are imitations I have checked the bar code for that. none else having this issue? I had a B string break for no reason too.	-1
Some of my strings weren't fully wrapped, which in turn ruins the playability ofba guitar. Nonetheless, I got what I paid for. Dissapointed in quality, however.	-1
Too thick for drop D it is just in comfortable. Even in drop c they feel way too chunky.	-1
Strings 5 and 6 (b and high e) broke as I was putting them on, not as good as the EXL 140s. unfortunately cant afford to buy a new pack to restring my PXD void 1.	-1
I played these strings for like three months and still don't sound like Stevie Ray Vaughan.  I've also been watching all his old interviews on YouTube and not once does he admit to the fact that he would have been nothing without this particular gauge of strings.  Nor does he cop to the fact that he used a plain 20 for the G string.  I am not impressed.  I will never play 13s again until I hear an official apology from his estate.  Music used to mean something, man.	-1
Seat becomes loose after each set of playing.	-1
After around 10 years of using these, I am finally switching to a different brand. The last 4 3set packs I have purchased came with at least 1 string deffective. Waste of time and money. Sometimes you can tell the string is deffective right away, but other times it takes a few strummings. This last one started to de-tune by itself brand new.	-1
not happy ...	-1
Good for the price.  UPDATE I have been using this throne for 5 months and today it broke. waste of money.	-1
The first two sets of strings were fine, loved them. Just opened the third pack and found they'd left out the 1st and 2nd (E & B) strings. Bought them long enough ago that I can't ask for a refund - which I wouldn't ask for since I already used two sets. But I do think they should send me my other two strings.	-1
I bought this throne because I was on a budget. It is easy to set up but it squeaks a lot! look elsewhere	-1
They're probably fine for standard 7 string tuning. However, on my Ibanez RG7 string they're incredibly loose and wobbly even when tuned down a half-step from standard. Bottom line if you're playing in anything other than standard don't even bother. Personally I don't even really like these anyway but they are not the worst strings for the price.	-1
Yeah, so after breaking 6 Ernie Ball high e strings in a row on my Parker Fly AND Parker NiteFly SA I ordered Electro Harmonix and broke that one too, then I ordered these with the reinforced ball ends- to discover that YOU GAVE ME TWO LOW E STRINGS AND NO A STRING IN THIS  PACKAGE.  Thanks, so so much for that.  So far the D'Addarios are the only strings that have not broken instantly.  You guys in the string business seriously need to get it together.  I think I'm in over one hundred bucks on stringing these two guitars and it has been some kind of surreal nightmare.	-1
Broke fast. Real men should find something sturdier.	-1
Does not adjust well!	-1
Very inexpensive. You get what you pay for. You will need an extra cushion for the seat if your gig lasts more than an hour. Hard on the backside!	-1
What a cheap piece of Chinese junk. This went right back into the box.	-1
I bought these strings to use for my 6 string to tune to drop B ..what I got was no 54 gauge string and 2 extra light strings !!! So I was disappointed ..won't buy again	-1
Ill admit the price is great but seating on it for awhile i could feel the seat starting to sag to its side... Also i didn't like how the chair does not spin..	-1
I have had this for 4 months and honestly I would rather eat hot coals than try to use it anymore! I used it solid for about a week (hour a night) and ended up with the worlds worse case of numb bum! I switched to a solid wood dining chair which was a million times better (with no padding). Now I'm 6'2" and 200lbs, so maybe it would be OK for a child or someone who weighs 150lbs or less. Plus I found it to be too high without enough holes to lower it. So I had to take the pin out completely and let it just drop... I have now ordered a big throne for about five times the money of this stool and if someone told me it would cost me my soul i'd give it to them! Maybe a bit on the extreme side but it really is torture to sit on this stool and attempt to drum, on top of that I was attempting to improve my double bass technique which made it a lot worse...	-1
For $30 you would expect your legs Not to go numb after 15 minutes...Now for some one who doesn't weigh 185 lbs approx or more it may work. I did notice most 5 stars were for people buying for a kid so at that weight and rearend size it may work, but for me it was a waste of money I may put it on "another internet site for about 20"..If you are an adult buying for yourself don't bother....	-1
Why is this the number one rated drum throne?  It's very uncomfortable.  The seat is very hard.  So hard that my butt and spine were aching after sitting on this for 30 minutes.  Also the cushion doesn't rotate.	-1
Not the best strings.	-1
I recently purchased these strings twice within the same month. The first set's G string popped while I was tuning from Drop C to E standard as slow as possible and almost immediately after I started winding it popped. Then my high e string popped while loosening it from E Standard to Drop C. The second set I bought five days ago and when I set it up in E Standard and it played perfectly fine then I tuned it to Drop C; everything fine. Suddenly while starting to tune back to E Standard not even turning the peg a quarter of the way "snap!"  it broke. I do not recommend these strinags, particularly for their inability to be tuned back and/or forth, even slowly without breaking. For this reason I recommend Ernie Ball or Fender strings. The only positive thing I have to say about these strings is the bright, clear, soft tone along with their great ability to stay in tuning once tuned better than some brands such as Ernie Ball.	-1
Got these for my kids guitar thinking they'd be easy on his fingers.  They're too thin.  They barely register on the pickups, presumably no enough mass to get a good response.  They also go sharp way too easy if you play chords.  Switched to 9's.  These are horrible.	-1
2 strings broke while stretching them and can't get hold of D'Addario on their website!!! A little upset!!!!!!;;!;	-1
Amazing at first but after not playing for 3 weeks in my case they got rusted really bad...might go back to elixirs or other strings that won't rust as fast.	-1
Some say that this will fix all of your G String issues on a LesPaul type of guitar (I have a Gretsch Pro Jet). While this is true, it will also kill the tone of the guitar. I am not sure why, but this one string made a large impact on the tone of my guitar and I felt like I was playing a very dull guitar with almost no high end capabilities. This was a deal breaker for me since this made the guitar's high end (which is already the weak link on any LesPaul type guitars) even worse.  I would only recommend these string to someone who plays jazz and similar styles and has a tuning issue. Ohterwise I would say they take away more than they give.  In short, while it may fix the tuning issues with the G string it will also affect your tone negatively.	-1
Hi! I clearly remember buying a set of 10 normal light strings D'Addario (10-46). And i just received one set of strings. I mean ... apparently you made a mistake. you sent me a package of one set of strings, when in fact buy the set of 10. I really need to solve my problem because i want to keep my instrument working. I hope you can help me to give my opinion on the matter.  Thanks in advance for your attention...	-1
4 of the strings snapped Two high E's Two B's	-1
Was pretty fast shipping but the strings make a strange sound. When you play you can hear an extra sound that shouldn't be there.	-1
I've been using daddario for over a decade and I got really disappointed. the first set I opened was okay, but the second featured a very prolongued coating defect. I don't intend to return the whole package because I'm not living in the US now. but I definitely won't buy another.	-1
when I was young 12's were good .....at 70 not anymore	-1
ok	-1
i don't know if i just got a dud but, i went through 3 high e strings in 3 days. the first one snapped before it could get to e, the second one snapped while loosening the string (seriously!?). and the third one just snapped while sitting in high e.	-1
I have six guitars that I need to keep fresh strings on, and I thought I was getting a deal here, but I was extremely disappointed when these strings lost their punch almost immediately. I usually can count on D'Adario for a good, long lasting clean sound, but these guys just deadened out so quickly that I'll be going back to Ernie's from now on.	-1
Sound is great but quickly fades with corrosion.	-1
nunca llegaron a mis manos	-1
Sounds ok, durability really sucks... Just buy when there's not Elixir or Earnie Ball available.	-1
The worst, low quality strings I have ever used in over 3 decades of playing the guitar. I've used several different strings in my lifetime, from GHS Boomers to Fender Bullets, to my only true love, Ernie Ball Super Slinky's, and I have to say these are the absolute worst strings I've ever played... here is why... They NEVER stay in tune on any guitar I own (and I've tried themon several, from ESPs to Gibsons, to USA Fenders). I am CONSTANTLY tuning these POS strings. One chord after tuning and the whole guitar needs to be re-tuned. Next, they stay bright for about 2 hours. These are some of the deadest feeling/sounding strings I have ever played. I know a lot of people will disagree with me, and I really do not know why so many people love these so much. I thikn it's because they are cheap and marketed well. Sadly, like I said... to me, worst string ever made. Makes sense I was buying these 10 packs for like $16.	-1
I decided to get this because I have 14 guitars and buying strings can get expensive. Plus these are the strings I prefer anyways. Had high hopes for it but even looking at the picture I thought "I wonder how they get the strings to not bind up inside?". The answer? They didn't. First string I went to grab was the low E. I followed the instructions and held the rest of the strings in place while pulling and it got stuck. Pulled as hard as I could without risking damage to the string and it would only come out about 6 inches...and then it wouldn't go back in. I tried another string, same thing. I now had 2 low E strings sticking out 6 inches from the box. I had no choice but to open the box up all the way, take apart the plastic spools inside, unwind ALL of the low E strings, and then try to wrap them back up again. The result? I now have 25 brand new low E strings with finger prints all over them. Thought my problems were over once I finished with the 3 wound strings. Nope. Sure enough went to grab a G and it got stuck. Took some serious coaxing to get it out. I would rather pay the extra money for 25 individual sets of these strings than ever get this bulk box again. They didn't even wrap each bundle of strings in protective sleeves either so by the time I use the last few sets they will probably be corroded and useless. Especially the low E's thanks to my prints. Basically what I'm saying is unless you are a guitar repair tech and plan on changing 25 sets of strings in one week do NOT buy this. Waste of money.	-1
Do not buy these strings for an Extended Range Guitar.  I have a 28.625 inch scale on my Agile 8 string and the lowest string (the 74), turns into a 50 before it reaches the nut.  Ernie Ball 8 string slinkies have the exact same problem.  The only manufacturer who doesn't skimp on winding the whole string seems to be DR for their Tite Fit Tosin Abasi and Javier Reyes strings.	-1
I kept these on for about a week and switched to dunlop heavy core. They don't handle down tuning very well and they have a odd metal (not the music style) sound to them.	-1
I bought a set of 3 regular light gauge (.10) strings.  When I went to install the low E string, it must have been defective, because there was hardly any tension on the string I was winding when it broke just before the saddle.  I have included a picture of the break as a customer picture.  I was able to replace it with the low E string from the next set, however I'm still out a set of strings.  It isn't worth the hassle to return the pack, so I'm keeping them, but this'll probably be the last time I purchase from this brand.	-1
I've purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store. Mainly due to the low cost. They work okay, but are difficult to keep in tune. The guitars have to be re-tuned often when temperature, humidity, or playing more than ten minutes occurs. My biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion. Add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string, then the strings go "flat" sounding. These are not quality strings at all, just cheap Chinese Made quality. They are okay for someone that doesn't play often, but if you play daily or as a performer, avoid these strings. Better strings are worth the extra cost. You actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings. I've had this problem with all the D'Addario brand strings, both for electric or acoustic, 6 or 12 string guitars. The thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing. The tarnish and corrosion often ends up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time. Cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster.	-1
Let me start off by saying 2 things...  One, i usually don't write negative reviews.. this one is important though because this product has taken away my favorite hobby for over a month now...  Two, that in not an amateur player and have been around guitars quite a bit in my life so I know what I'm doing with guitars...  I've played and used MANY different brands and types of strings and until now my two "go to" brands for good strings at a decent price were DR & D'Addario (Thomastic Infeld's are the best IMHO, but they fall well outside of the "decent price" genre...)  Anyway, About a month ago I needed some strings and since I had heard of the new BT sets from D'Addario I thought I'd give em' a shot....  I've regretted it ever since.... (I ordered the  EXL120BT's)  To the point.....  I install the strings, stretch them a little afterwards, tune em, clean/polish everything, spray a small coat of Fingerease and let it dry, etc...  My standard string install method I've used a 100x over or more with no problems or no noticeable issues...  Then i start to playing....  (biggest mistake I've made this year so far)....  Around 2 minutes into playing on the new strings (I use a few Gilmour solos to stretch the strings out after I install a set) I notice that my fingers on my left hand are REALLY starting to hurt, (especially my ring finger)....  When I stop and take a look at my fingers, I can see little tiny "fine hair" like metal splinters ALL OVER each finger, and a few of the larger normal sized splinters most of us have seen from time to time...  Some are really small and difficult to see without a magnifying glass, and, others are your standard metal shard, but ALL hurt like %#!$@!!!!  ESPECIALLY when you touch anything with those fingers... (You know, like a guitar fretboard for instance)  Fast forward to today....  And I SWEAR that I am not exaggerating....  I have not been able to play guitar since this happened due to the pain in my fingers, and I have pulled no less than 30 metal splinters from my middle, pointer and pinky finger on my left hand combined.... (I have finally gotten them all out as of about a week ago, which is around 3 weeks after the "incident")  As for my ring finger, the last count on it was 63 metal splinters (most being the little fine hair-like ones that are difficult to see without a good magnifying glass and get out without precision tweezers, but feel like knife wounds when you touch a hard object) that I have removed...  There are still several in this finger of the larger type and are so deep that I am unable to get to them so far..  I'm going to have to visit a doctor for these most likely...  Needless to say, I will NEVER buy another thing this company makes...  If you had gone through what I have (and still am), I can assure you that you'd be there with me...  Worst experience in my life with a product..  If I was the lawsuit type, they would have one....  (& if this doesn't end soon, they may still)  BUYER BEWARE.....  Don't say you weren't warned....	-1
CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again	-1
I don't know what the problem is. I just went through 2 high E strings in less than a month. I ordered this pack and gave a set to my friend. I kept 2 for my self thinking they would last me,but the high E quickly broke off...the first time could've been my fault I guess, I was trying to stretch the string out but it broke off. the second time I was just retuning. since I do do that a lot. I go from standard sometimes all the way down to B..As I was dropping the string, it just broke off. i've used nothing but Ernie Ball slinky's since I first began playing guitar and those are the strings that i've pretty much stuck to. They have never broken this quickly ever.  I don't know if it's the quality of the d'addario's or my guitar has some bridge issues.. But I have never had strings break off on me so easily...Since Amazon is only offering Slinky's as add on items I went with these even though I had never used a set ....Maybe I was wrong to try a different brand I had never used..  UPDATE: I was contacted by the company and they were able to solve my issue. I think I may have gotten some old sets,i'm not quite sure,but the year on the box was 2007,i'm not sure if that was the year the strings were made or just a random date on the box. But the company helped out and everything is good now :)	-1
I managed to get through one night at a gig with these strings. I have been playing for 50 years and have used many D'addario strings and other products. These strings will not play in tune( and yes i did the intonation)!!	-1
Frankly I did not like the design of the dispenser. Prefer vacuum packed strings. I have six guitars, I change my guitar strings simultaneously each month. I think in this case comes to damaging moisture easily release them the ropes yet. Dispenser design really bad, hard to pull some strings that's not good, it hurts, buy this package by mistake, I'm sorry	-1
After putting the strings on the guitar I noticed that 3rd string had a different tint from other 5 strings. Also it's thickness was nearly identical to the second string and sound it made was somehow out of place.  Other 5 strings were in perfect condition but I ordered a set of 6 and expected to receive them all in a decent condition. I am disappointed, thus 1 star.	-1
Having used D'Addario happily (as well as other brands) over the years, I felt a bit pissed off when, several weeks after purchasing these, I opened them and saw that they had a lot of corrosion.  I like the enviromentally friendly packaging, but it may have not worked this time. Or else they may need some QC.	-1
I have played on D'addario Before,  actually the first string I started out on. Super light's are ok,  but can wear out real fast,  So, It's importent not to put to much stess on  them.....espescially if You do alot of tricks, pinched hormonic's vibrato's, extreme bend's,  etc  they will break.  Any skilled guitarist know's  to use  extream  caution when tuning....any strings,  I did try extra light (while they do soud nice,and have a nice feel to them)  I would not recamend these for beginer's,  cause beginer's tend to press hard, when they first stat out.  Personally,  I don't like D'addario's at all,  I find the tone to bright.	-1
I really like the stand, but when I opened it, it was missing the set screw that holds the neck support in place. I e-mailed amazon, but have yet to hear back from them. For now, it's just junk taking up space in my music room. Can't trust it to hold my guitar stable!	-1
GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.	-1
Does its job barely, kinda tippy	-1
Finally got around to actually putting a guitar on this stand, after having bought it months ago and setting it up (my kids took the guitar for it to school and kept it there - just got it back when their guitar unit ended).  I bought this as a "very good condition" used purchase, through Amazon, just to save a couple of dollars, and I made a mistake.  It's messed-up.  It looks fine, but it has a severe flaw.  Either it was manufactured incorrectly, or whomever returned it (most likely) stepped on the front legs, or something, because the upright part is almost perfectly vertical, and the bottom holder bars practically tilt downwards, which means if I put my guitar all the way in, it will fall out.  I've got another guitar on it now, but a had to put it in at an angle.  There's no top strap to lock-in the neck, either.  I really was not paying attention.  I threw away the box it came in, too.  Amazon might still take it back, but then I'd have to find a good sized box, probably pay for shipping, etc.  Pita.  I'm going to see if I can bend it back into usable shape.  Fwiw, I do own 4 others of these, that I bought brand new, and they're all fine.  I had previously given this item 5 stars, which a brand new one, manufactured properly, would deserve.  Btw, one newbie mistake people make with this is that the legs have to lock into place.  You have to exert some force to do this, and if you don't, the stand will lean wrong, and be unstable, so if you have one, and have this issue, first make sure the legs are clicked-in all the way.  Just don't crush the thing!	-1
Not sturdy enough..	-1
I had purchased two of the stands prior to this purchase, the quality of this one seems inferior to the prior ones I would not recommend the stand it leans back to far The build quality is subpar look somewhere else get a better one.	-1
Not very well welded. I'm replacing one that got broken in a party. It broke between the peg that goes through the bottom frame and the fork that sticks out. That should have been forged out of one piece of metal, or created in some sturdy way.  I'm only buying the same one because 1) the person who actually owns it won't notice if I replace just the bottom part with the new piece and 2) it's really cheap.	-1
The guitar stands are great, especially for the price, but one of the 3 was missing a piece at the top that holds the guitar in place. Not worth the hassle to return.	-1
Seems to be made well but a couple of real problems for me were: it doesn't hold 1 piece of sheet music. That's your regular 8 1/2 x 11 standing up. The clips don't cover that in the center and off to the side they just won't hold it. So putting my binder on it, and it's not a really big binder, the top droops down backward. Ugh, do disappointed.	-1
Doesn't stay straight, very crooked but aren't all these types of stands	-1
the stand is fine but the part that holds the music is flimsy and will not hold even a small binder	-1
This is junk. It was broken right out of the box. I can't even imagine how it could possibly hold up after a number of "Opens" and "Closes".  "	-1
I'm familiar with the On Stage Classic Series XCG-4. I have two that Ive used for years. The Amazon images above are of an On Stage Classic series XCG-4 guitar stand. But there is something wrong here. What I received is either a cheap knock off, or, On Stage changed their XCG-4 for the worse.  And based on reviewer photos. It appears others have also received a different item then what is pictured above by Amazon. Considering the issues they mention, I am not at all surprised by the issues they are having. This stand is not designed as well as the XCG-4s I know. End caps simply fall off. Neck yoke band strap is different size and not as firm. Body yoke is narrower. There is more play where the Vee groove sits in the bottom tube. Creating more distance for the Tee handle screw to travel in to hold the top tube firmly. T handle knob is smaller. Added up its not as easy to use.  Best I could find out from On-Stage was that they did change/modify the XCG-4 Classic Stand.  What those changes were, I cant say.  The silver label with silver underline reading; On-Stage only, is the one I am reviewing.  Knowing the previous iteration of this stand, I would not recommend this stand.	-1
Stand is not as tall as my other 4 guitar stands. Will not buy anothet.	-1
This is a piece of junk do not buy it. I bought this as a traveling music stand and thought it would be fine when I ordered it. It would be OK if all you were putting on it was some light sheet music.  However if you put  A heavier book of music on it the top just drifts backwards. You cannot tighten it enough to support anything substantial. This is a big disappointment.	-1
Too flimsy and cheap....	-1
Too flimsy, I sent it back - I think it was the sheet metal stabilizing the tray that was the least well engineered.	-1
This really needs to be highlighted its best suited for acoustic guitars, not electric.	-1
Meh... You get what you pay for. The neck guards pop off every other time you take the guitar our. Not the most stable units but you get what you pay for.	-1
Sorry, but the one I got is junk.  Waaaay too flimsy!  The tightening knobs stripped after only a use or two.  I have pinned it with a couple of machine screws to make it workable to take to jams, but it is clearly the worst stand among all the players, and one of the better players!  I gotta get to a music store to buy a replacement!  I can't believe that the positive reviewers got the stand I got, unless they are totally insane!	-1
Broken when I got it. But it still holds music. Very flimsy.	-1
Very cheap quality but it is cheap, so....	-1
Terrible buy. Had to tape it together with black electrical tape.	-1
Be aware that this music stands is somewhat fragile. The metal is thin. We've only had it for a few days and already one of the legs is bent. It is suitable for placing a few pages of sheet music on the support but not much more. My daughters music notebook with about 80 pages caused it to topple over. The height adjusts satisfactorily. It folds up and comes with a carrying sack which is convenient. It is just "okay" for the cost if it's used gingerly.  But if you are expecting a music stand like you had in school,  this isn't it.	-1
Band that secures guitar neck in place can easily come off due to the plastic securing pegs being somewhat loose.  Those pegs should be fixed in place.  The stem (long part) can also slide around after tightening it, although that was when lifting the whole thing by guitar neck and the guitar stand stem.	-1
Looks weird on the mics. Sent them back.	-1
Shipped with the neck bar bent. Everything else is nice about it. Except it's not centered.	-1
Poor quality. The dye color bled onto each other and permanently stained each other. Shure will not back up their product. A shame!	-1
It holds a guitar....barely.  Flimsy and cheap.  Bottom bracket keeps popping off.	-1
The product I received was a cheap imitation and not an authentic Shure product. If you receive this windscreen loose without Shure retail packaging, you should consider it to be a fake.	-1
Product does not fit SM58 Shure mic	-1
OK I really don't know where to begin with this review, so Ill just say it outright.  THIS STAND IS POORLY DESIGNED, MADE OF CHEAP COMPONENTS, UNSTABLE, UNSAFE, AND SMELLS *** REALLY BAD ***. I wasn't expecting much at this price point but figured Id at least get a basic functional stand suitable for home use.  This stand however isn't even usable.  First, it doesnt bode well when the first thing you see when opening the box is a PROP 65 sticker. That tells you right away the product contains cancer causing chemicals or substances. That reason alone is enough for me to return it.  Second, did I mention the HORRIBLE SMELL? This stand smells of acrid chemicals. So much so it gave me an instant headache.  My sense of smell is somewhat diminished and to me it was VERY strong. I can only imagine what it must smell like to a person with a normal sense of smell. I bought the double pack so it was double the odor.  I cant believe that with the over 1400 reviews that people aren't mentioning the smell. This cant be an isolated incident. I shouldnt be expected to smell that for a few weeks while who knows what chemicals off gas.  Now about the stand itself. The thing is made from cheap lightweight materials. The design is very unstable.  The rear leg is only 3  long and allows the stand to tip over way too easy. Theres no way Im putting any guitar on it.  For comparison, I have an older Peavey stand and the rear leg on that stand is over 6 inches long.  The nut and screw assembly for tightening the upper yoke to the stand base is a loose fitting pressed in thing that just spells trouble down the road.  The lower yoke that holds the guitar body just slips through a hole punched in the tubing.  No support pieces help to stiffen up the area where the yoke passes through.  Again another area that spells trouble.  I bought these stands based on overwhelmingly positive reviews for this item. I cant believe 69% of people rated this 5 stars.  SMH, I wonder what stand they were talking about because the ones I got are total junk.  Do yourself a favor and avoid these at all costs.  These are being returned and I'll order a different brand and style.	-1
I have been playing guitar for 40 years. I play 3 solo gigs a week singing and playing. I needed a new windscreen for my Shure Beta 58 so I bought a Shure windscreen. In less than 2 weeks the material began to deteriorate and Iwas left with black crumbs peeling off into my mouth at times while i sang. Horrible quality. I had to throw it away. I bought an On Stage windscreen and it is working great.	-1
I bought these to use with a specific group I work with and the screens did not fit my mic heads. I was very disappointed. Thankfully I ordered a different brand at the same time which fit perfectly.	-1
I read alot of the reviews, yet thought this would be OK for occasional use. It might be appropriate for holding a few sheets of paper, but that's about it. I found it to be very unstable for my use. My 30+ year old Hamilton music stand is much better quality. Disappointing.	-1
Stand is fine other than the completely useless "locking" mechanism which was my primary reason for purchasing.  The top "U" has push-on plastic endcaps, with essentially a rubber band between them.  When locked it's not too bad - but "unlocking" is pretty problematic.  Since the plastic pieces just push on, the typically simply slide on when you are attempting to remove the "band" - only they are not supposed to and the plastic piece falls out of the band and rolls around on the flood.  If you try what I did and use your thumb on the center of the plastic piece to stabilize it while removing the band the top of the plastic piece will fall off after a few times rendering the locking mechanism useless.	-1
I understand what some of the reviews are saying here, I don't give bad reviews; however this thing let my Martin D-28 Mama and Papas Edition #41 of 100 fall over backwards hard enough that it broke the capo that was on it at the time.  The back leg is way too short, so much so that it barely stands up on it's own, let alone holding a guitar.	-1
Seriously, why is this rated as high as it was and why in the world is the back leg so short?  Is this where the manufacturer decided to cut the budget?  Make the dang leg 3 inches longer and it won't feel like it's going to get tipped over everytime you reach for your guitar.  Jeez!  I immediately gave this to my daughter to use for her inexpensive starter guitar and bought the cool looking Stageline GS550A ( http://www.amazon.com/Stageline-GS550A-Wooden-Guitar-Stand/dp/B001VMOD2C ) instead, way safer and waaayy neater looking.	-1
really unstable.	-1
if you sing with your lips against the windscreen (at all, whether extremely light or you smoosh them) this screen will feel like sandpaper. It's the hardest material, most abrasive of any windscreen I ever tried. There's many other better solutions	-1
I'm giving this guitar stand 2 stars because the first guitar stand I received I only got the bottom half and had to request a replacement	-1
Satisfactory item. A bit flimsy and forward leaning.	-1
could have been of better quality, like they used to be. The fastener (to keep the guitar from falling forward) needs to be replaced by one that doesn't require bending, tweaking, ripping and torquing. It turns out that a simple rubber band does a much better job.	-1
Hey, here is a new idea for guitar stand:  Let's cut off the back leg and put a 2" stub instead.  I'm not joking.  Put the stand together and put it on the floor, it wobbled.  I nudged it and it fell over.  Less stable when the guitar's weight is added. This product is so poorly designed that I will never bother looking at the On Stage Brand again.  Save your $ and lean your guitar against the wall or couch: it will be more stable than this stand.	-1
It has nothing to do with Velveteen. Velveteen is a fabric. This is foam rubber, plain and simple. I was fooled. When asked, Godin Guitars/Seagull, has just replied to not use this against their finish because it will stick to the guitar. So, I will either be returning it , or covering the foam with some sort of barrier fabric. The stand itself is suitable for my needs, but deduct stars for attempt to deceive.	-1
I'm another reviewer who has, upon personal inspection, discovered that the rear leg of the stand is too short to provide staedy support for any beloved guitar. I returned it.  I've "First Act" brand stands similar in appearance but more intelligently constructed.	-1
This is the most widely used guitar stand.  It assembles easily, but does not adjust firmly, so it will always feel loose and flimsy. The neck retainer broke readily.  At least Amazon sells it at a fair price.	-1
All my other guitar stands are Ultra models with the orange rubber tubing.  This one looked fancier, and had a security strap, so I decided to buy one.  There isn't a lot of difference between this and the Ultra stands in terms of design, construction, or even weight.  Nevertheless, I can't recall ever having this much trouble with guitars tipping over.  Breathe on it, over it goes.  Look at it, guitar's in the floor.  A flatulent dog?  Guard your guitar!  The security strap keeps the neck from falling out of the cradle, so the guitar and stand kind of spill over as a unit.  I'm going to try popping the rubber caps off the legs and pouring some BBs in there for added weight.  I think it's just a question that this stand is a few ounces too light.  It's probably made of steel tubing one gauge lighter or something.  I'm on the fence between two stars and three, but the more I think about it, the more I regret the purchase, so I've decided to go with two stars.	-1
I returned this guitar stand because the back leg was so short that when we put a guitar on it, it tipped. Would not recommend this.	-1
This arrived with one end of the security strap and metal part...Broken! OK...I bought it on sale and returning it would not be an option...it would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy it! Obviously it was not the packaging which was more than adequate and there were no broken off pieces in the box. Of course,I could not recommend this product to anyone...most disappointing purchase!	-1
Got this for my Taylor 914ce Grand Auditorium. Noticed it is very misaligned and wobbly upon assembly. No way will I prop my Taylor up on it, but will chance my Yamaha APX500 on it, as long as it's suported by a wall. Overall not even worth $12, and you'd have to be crazy to try using THIS stand to suport and or showcase a Instrument that is also a Work of Art. Live and learn. Not recommended at all.	-1
Functionally, it's a great stand (and cheap), but it fell apart. Surprisingly, even though all metal, the joint holding the legs together rots and falls apart. Can't use it anymore...not as a guitar stand, anyway. It's a few years old; maybe they improved it since then. For $12+ I'd be willing to try again.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Ultimate-Pizza-Manual-Make-Pizza-Like-the-Pros-Used-To/dp/0980034655/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Ultimate Pizza Manual: Make Pizza Like the Pros...

Unfortunately there is no elegant way to clip the mic on a banjo so I had to return it. Never got to test it.	-1
Pros: It's cheap. Cons: it's cheap.  The corners lack padding and any protection beyond just the nylon. I'll be trading up for a better one soon.	-1
I bought this Stand because  is a very good idea  It is an excellent design for holding guitars wit the automatic grips and it seemed very sturdy at first --until the spring catch started to fail after a few gigs. I found that this was due to bad manufacture by use of plastic used to carry the pin that pivots the release switch to raise and lower the stand .The pins just tore the way too flimsy thin plastic cheeks and the stand will not click-lock into position anymore  ! Effectively rendering the stand useless! A disaster waiting to happen!	-1
I bought this after seeing a similar stand at a rehearsal and liked the idea of the clips that hold the guitar in.  I've had some of the cheaper everyday guitar stands, and had them knocked over in winds, people tripping on the stage, etc.  Thought this would be more stable.  With both of my basses on it, I didn't like how one of the basses would always hit one of the legs of the stand.  Also, if I removed one of the basses, the other bass would shift the balance of the stand and make it prone to tipping over.  I'm going to be returning this and probably get two single guitar stands.	-1
I'm sure it would be fine for pretty much all guitars, but for you banjo players out there looking for a double stand I wouldn't recommend this.  It's certainly sturdy and well-made, but the "locking" mechanism at the top was far too wide for my banjo pegheads, so it put all of the weight of the banjo on the tuning machines. Not good.  Perhaps if your banjo has a guitar-style paddle peghead you would have a better experience, but my Ramsey Standard & Reiter Whyte Laydie banjos didn't work at all so I returned it.	-1
These aren't very loud, more like a children's toy than performance ready. I would go with the king clave.	-1
I use this for my samba group and it's just not that loud. Might be useful for studio work or small intimate settings. For clave that cuts through, I recommend LP King Klave instead.	-1
I have been a big fan of Hercules Stands, and I own 4 guitar stands, 2 mic stands ( 2 - MS401B's), a music stand, and 2 of their boom arms. One of my MS401B's will not stay up. The other one is awesome and has worked great. I thought, no problem, I will contact Hercules support. I went to their website and there is no link for support. I went to the FAQ, and for Warranty info, they state:  "Hercules has different warranty policies for different countries . Contact your professional local distributor with any warranty inquiries." If you click on the link for local distributor, it lists stores where you can buy Hercules products. The product page for the MS401B has no mention of the warranty for this stand, and I did not see a way to contact Hercules directly. I called one of the "local distributors" and they did not know what the warranty was, either.  I purchased this from Amazon in 2011, and I did not really start using it until recently. So, just be aware that this is a fantastic stand when it works, but when it breaks, be prepared to toss it. Be sure to test it thoroughly before your 30 day Amazon exchange has expired.	-1
Very poor shape for my Yamaha F335 guitar.  Too baggy around the neck area; room enough for three or for necks.	-1
In less than one month. The shoulder straps went off. The seam go off.  It is very low quality. The designer made a good job, but the workers used very low quality and tiny thread.	-1
ok when i saw the bag i was impressed nice looking and perfect style so i decided to buy it but the bag just arrive home "12/23/11" and is way different from the one on the picture is a black bag with one ugly red line on the middle and it looks like is not going to protect my guitar i am really upset, i would not returned because i don't feel like fighting with no body but they shouldn't do that to the costumer we pay how much they asking so a least we should get what we pay for.	-1
Used to have a trombone snake that looked like this.  black vinyl with orange brush ends.  That was a yamaha snake that I had back in grade school and high school.  This doesn't even come close. The company that sells this packages it well, etc but the product itself is not adequate.  It went in the garbage.  buy a yamaha snake if you want a good one.	-1
Wanted to love them but they die fast and a few of them have slight burs or notches in them, seems like these are the discards from the actual manufactured ones	-1
I installed this pickup in my guitar and all I noticed is now that i have a bigger magnet pickup I have more un wanted noise. This pickup only enhanced my sound a tiny bit. I ended up having to copper shield my guitar which helped some but for what little change i got, I wouldn`t have even changed the pickup.	-1
Had to return them.  Heads were so cheap and had split lines in them that I was afraid to even use them as would be replacing heads fast.	-1
I was a bit skeptical that bridge pins would make much of a different to the sound of guitar, but a number of the reviews available on the web indicated they improved its tonal qualities.  Also, the plastic pins which came with my guitar appear to be rather cheap and thus, I thought there might be an opportunity for improvement perhaps on par with new strings or a pick more suitable to my tastes.  The good news is that I can say emphatically that bridge pins can change a guitar's sound.  The bad news is that they made my guitar sound absolutely horrible.  I experienced high pitched tinny sounds to the extent that I could only tolerate them for about 1/2 an hour before I felt compelled to remove them and replace the plastic pins.  The next day, I repeated the experiment with the same results just to ensure that something unexpected had not occurred during the installation process.  I will accept that depending on the guitar, these bridge pins may work for you.  In my case they absolutely did not.  However, for the price, it was a relatively inexpensive trial.	-1
These pop apart fairly easily. I ended up gluing mine to keep in place. Works fine but not remove able now	-1
I used it on my Epiphone Blueshawk with original strap button hardware.. consistent size as with other Epiphones I own.. however, it pops off. This strap lock has a good design, but poor implementation and cannot be relied upon to keep strap from popping off.  The rotating part of the lock even  winds up separating from the other half... so it is a useless  lock item. And: I am not moving around when I play, just sitting on a stool... ordinary movement pops it off.  One can get better results by jsut going to a local hardware store and buying some beoprene washers... they snugly go over strap post and only cost a few cents each.  No innovation, just a simple way to secure straps.	-1
Doesnt fit Gibson buttons.	-1
The hole will only fit over a small strap button. I have 3 guitars,  and it only fits over the button on one, and only if I use the nylon strap. It I use a leather strap,  the strap is too thick to allow room to put this button over it. Pretty useless.	-1
These are no better than Grolsh rubbers.  They're not as good as real strap lock systems.  They broke quite easily upon attempted installation.	-1
Great idea but it's so thick it takes up all the space on the nut, so no room for the strap end. So you need to add a rubber washer to raise up the nut about a 1/4 inch.  This might be okay for a solid body but no way I would do it to a hollow body or acoustic guitar.	-1
Doesn't fit many of my guitars. The hole isn't big enough for the stock/original strap buttons to fit through. Oh well.	-1
It's cheap plastic and doesn't hold the strap on.  You're risking dropping your guitar and you're risking damaging other stuff that the guitar will hit.	-1
I picked this up as a inexpensive option to put strap locks on my daughter's DRG Classic.  Its not a tremendously expensive electric, but its heavy and she's pulled a strap off once before.  In an attempt to get a low cost low effort solution - I picked these up.  What a disappointment.  The clips were difficult to get over her knobs and a thick leather strap... in an attempt to verify function, putting a thin strap on appeared to secure the strap, but a strong pull just popped them off.  In addition to the ineffective security of these locks, my daughter's opinion were that they looked terrible.  And they do certainly stand out as odd looking.  I bit the bullet and put some schaller locks instead and she's happy with them and they work very well.  Invest in decent locks, get the straplok or schaller style and don't risk your guitar... avoid these.	-1
I would have to say that this is a good idea but the product is just complete junk. If you have a quality strap then there is no room for this and if you use any force at all it will fly apart I just don't trust that it will hold together, it's just not worth the risk even if I could get it to fit. I have some locking straps that use a similar concept but they actually work and are far better quality.	-1
Don't buy this item, it fail me and I was fortunate not to drop my best guitar. It doesn't work properly.	-1
when turned a litte more that 180* the center pops out.....	-1
Used them on the back peg of an ES335. The pull of the strap eventually ripped them apart. Cracked and fell off. I tried both of the strap locks different ways until both had broken.	-1
Don't bother, too thick for most strap buttons.  If your strap is is super thin it might work.	-1
This looks like a good idea, but these open up on you when you'd least expect it to happen, which makes them defeat the intended purpose. Buy the ceramic beer bottle gaskets which cost peanuts and work great.	-1
I purchased these as well as the Jim Dunlop 7000 locks.  I recommend the 7000 model.  They both work the same way and are made pretty much the same way, but these are just to big and clumsy.  The 7000 model does the same and doesn't take as much space.  You will need the straps to either be thin at the ends or your strap buttons/pegs to have enough room for the strap and then these units.  This is true for either one of the models.  I have a regular nylon 2" Levy strap and these two models (7000 and 7007SI) work well, but I prefer the smaller, rounder model (7000).	-1
They only fit if you have enough room in your strap button, if not they will just pop right out. I threw mine away.	-1
Granted that at this price there isn't a great surprise that quality is bad, but some things do need said of these.  They are small. They are brittle and easy to break, and the material doesn't lend itself to this application in my opinion. The twist lock comes undone very easily. Thicker straps are very difficult to attach with these, and end up coming undone or popping it off across the room.  Most importantly, they fit very awkwardly on all of my guitars (many Deans, a couple of Epiphones, and a Gibson SG). The strap pegs on all of my guitars weren't accepting of these strap locks, even without a strap attached.  The primitive and ineffective method of 'securing' these locks is to twist the top part, which closes an opening over the strap peg (think of salt shakers with the twist lid).  If you're anything like me and value your guitar far too much to let it fall to the ground just to save a few bucks, don't buy these.	-1
Why go this route if your trying to protect your guitar or bass or whatever when you can get a proper one and really protect your investment you've spent the money on the gear and your going to cheap out on something like this....I tried 2 or these and if you use a decent strap there a pain in the ass and can pop off regular strap locks are the way to go....OR YOU COULD BE REPAIRING YOUR NECK THATS SOME REAL MONEY	-1
I don't know what kind of guitar you would use this on, the holes are way too small for me to use on any of my guitars.	-1
It also makes the strap real stiff on the ones that it does fit and is unsightly unless on the heel of an acoustic guitar.	-1
Hard to believe this was so bad. I have a Planet Waves locking guitar strap, which is a dream, and thought this would allow me to lock a regular strap. However, it is so thick that it can't really fit on a regular guitar strap pin with a strap, and when I tried to lock it, the two pieces came apart. Go with the Planet Waves Lock Straps.	-1
I even called Dunlop to see if these lok strap systems would work for an electric acoustic.  The guy at Dunlop told me "oh yes, they have been specifically designed to work with electric acoustic".  That is NOT the case.  I purchased multiple units, and it will cost me more to return to Amazon than it's worth.  But basically I know have hunks of plastic that I could use to make a sculpture!  Because of the bottom pin being the plug in for electric pick up, the thickness causes a problem and this plastic do hickey will not fit.  If anyone out there has a solution for securing the strap, please reply to this feedback.  What really frosts me is that I called Dunlop and apparently their customer service folks don't know their products well enough to be recommending product.  It's called, TRAIN your people!!!	-1
I received this and was looking forward to a new strap for my new 2013 PRS Paul's guitar, but open opening it the strap was hard and Greezy.  It was nasty.  Worse yet, the Greezy feeling was irritating to the skin.  It bothered me the entire day.  I would pass on this one as normally Levy's Leathers makes a nice guitar strap.	-1
I purchased three of these through amazon.  When I attached one of them to my snare, it clamped on to it "ok".  But AFTER attaching my microphone (ElectroVoice PL35 drum mic) the weight of the mic was too much for the arm of the clamp, and the mic kept "falling" over ONTO the drum head.  The arm of this clamp IS NOT strong enough to support the weight of a microphone.  It is weak and flimsy.  It will not hold up.  The arm of this clamp has a wing nut that allows you to adjust its angle.  There are no "teeth" on it however, and the weight of a microphone is too much for it to support which causes the mic fall over onto your drum head.  It is a weak and "wimpy" clamp that can not support the weight of a microphone.  VERY POORLY MADE  ***see my uploaded pic and notes (point your "pointer / cursor" over the 3rd and 4th pics)  I returned mine asap and got a full refund from Amazon...  Thank you Amazon!  The most professional retailer out there!  ALWAYS VERY HELPFUL!  Look elsewhere for a drum mic clip / mounting system because this one does not work.  Cheap plastic, poor design, DOES NOT function!	-1
RETURNED	-1
Good clip BUT ironically doesnt fit a Shure SM58 Mic.  The holder is too big.  Didnt worry about sending it back due to price.	-1
I'm now buying my third cable.  As everyone else states, they don't last that long.  I wonder if posting this review on the Shure PGX Wireless unit will get any attention from Shure.  There stuff is usually rock solid and lasts for years, these cables each lasted maybe only a year or two each.  For me that's only 40 gigs.  The first one I got to last a little longer by actually going in and repairing the solder joint but everything in there is so small, it's not at all like soldering a regular guitar cable.  The latest one broke in a different way.  The brass female connectors inside the end which goes to the belt pack actually started coming out of its housing.  Completely broke the connection inside.  I would buy something different if I could but the wireless unit itself cost around $300 and it's quite an investment to get a different unit.  So here I'll just keep throwing $16 at the problem.	-1
I know it's for a kid's set, but the quality vs. price is way off base. The difference in size is not so great that a better quality, used (full sized) stand would be a wiser choice. The hi-hat is one of the most used pieces in the kit, and should be more durable and smooth to operate.	-1
purchased this garbage very flimsy cymbals are cheap stand is junk i don't recoment this product at all not happy	-1
The pedal does what it's supposed to do, and as long as you tape it to the floor, it won't move. Otherwise, I'm constantly having to grab and reposition it with my foot.	-1
Extremely hard to assemble and at it's lowest height it is too large for a 48 piano keyboard. Was a pain to assemble and although it feels sturdy I'm not sure that this is an official Yamaha stand? I should've bought a different stand.	-1
Seems sturdy but I don't like the adjustment mechanism. It doesn't offer enough adjustment settings.  One adjustment was too low, the next adjustment was too high.  I had to make a plywood spacer to get the height that I wanted.  I suggest looking at other stands.	-1
This is very cheap.  If you have a small keyboard it will work fine.  If you have a large and heavy keyboard it will bend and break.  My wife couldn't use this for her keyboard due to it being flimsy.  I use it in the garage as a saw horse now.	-1
Piece of junk. We sent it back and bought a stand from a music store for $10 more that was all assembled and very sturdy.	-1
This is much smaller than advertised, and ridiculously expense at $32+ dollars. The turbine rattles and will not last long. The quality of the metal is sub par.  Volume is below what you should get for this price. Timbre and pitch are narrow and it just shrieks at the high end with a shrill cheap vibration. Sadly, this is Poorly Made in England.	-1
hard to slide.  cannot really play it smoothly back and forth like a trombone, just forward and than back	-1
Some reviews are good, some reviews are bad, and I'd say that speaks to quality control.  I decided to roll the dice anyway, and I got a shiny metal tooth chipping machine for my trouble.  The whistle looks great, and it feels solid and well-made.  The issue, as described by several other reviewers, is the fit of the piston within its cylinder.  In the case of my whistle, it's quite stiff, and getting it to move requires considerable muscle input.  What happens when you have a hard metal object in your mouth, and you apply a heavy amount of elbow grease to attempt to send part of it moving toward your face?  If you're not careful, you'll chip your teeth!  Trying to slide it down tends to pull it from your mouth, so when you try to slide it back up, you have effectively backed up to give the whistle a good running start at kicking you in the teeth again.  This is not pleasant!  I tried to get the action to loosen up by cycling it repeatedly across its full stroke, enduring many lewd comments from my family as I sat there on the couch moving my slide up and down repeatedly.  As I worked it, white grease started to work its way out the bottom, so the whistle definitely came lubricated from the factory.  I worked it until the metal started to get hot from the friction, and then I worked it longer. I added various brass instrument valve oils through the mouthpiece, as there is no way to remove the plug at the bottom without drilling out the places where it is peened into place.  In the end, I wound up with a foul-tasting, oily, hard metal tooth chipper that functions somewhat less poorly than before, but it is a long way from being even slightly usable.  I gambled, I lost, and so it goes.	-1
The strings have the sound I was looking for but two of the strings buzzed/rattled when strummed. It was not the action rather the strings themselves. Too bad because this is NJ company I wanted to support.	-1
I've been playing guitar for a long while and love elixirs, but people suggested trying out DR Pros. I like how they are priced but I think these strings were dead after a few weeks. While they are cheaper then elixirs...I will have to use 2-3 pairs just to equal the playing time I get with other strings. I was sad that I bought 3 pair but luckily they went quickly. They do sound pretty good during that first week or two...that's why I have more then 1 star. I would really do 2.5 but that's not an option.	-1
This is G7th's little brother to the G7th G7 Performance 2 capo which I own and love. This barely works on a guitar, at least a good acoustic one. It's too weak and flimsy in comparison to the same capo they make and market as the G7th G7 Performance 2 Capo....that's the one you want, and it will be the last capo you will ever use or buy. I needed a backup, and this doesn't qualify as a worthy capo on any level. You can tell the difference in size and weight....the G7th G7 Performance 2 Capo is more expensive, is heavier in weight and in girth. I wasted good money on this not knowing they added this cheap junk to get folks to buy in at a lower price point....$67 for the "good one," versus $37 for this junk. Buyer beware!	-1
did not work with my Martin OM28. The strings were muted no matter how hard I closed. Maybe the radius was off or something. I sent it back. Seems nicely made, but heavy	-1
nice looking capo but it doesn't function as well as I had hoped ... string buzz is a constant problem ... eventually I can get it to work but it is too much trouble and too inconsistent for gigging ... disappointed ...	-1
Doesn't clamp tight enough on Capo1 ... I missed the return date by 1 day, so I'm stuck with it.	-1
I have a high expectation on this capo when I saw the fantastic design and convenience for use, which however finally failed me. I cannot use it on both of my taylor and martin guitars, when I put it on my fretboard and squeeze it firmly and even excessively, the 4th string is always buzzing, I have tried different ways/angles to put it on the fret however it never worked once, I'll go back to my planet waves NS capo, really really really really disappointed at this capo	-1
Package - A nice display casing done well and is pretty standard music store packaging  Function - Well, failed miserably. The unit has a level around you thumb area. Pressing upward releases the tension and you simply squeeze the capo over the desired fret until there is no longer buzzing and you haven't gone sharp. All well and good in theory. This is the 2 unit and the last I'm afraid.    Problem A - the lever for the thumb doesn't release as smoothly as you need it to causing a fumbling with the capo as you are trying to release  and pull it off. It's extremely poor when your are stretching to place in on the end of the headstock. You will drop it occasionally.    Problem B - Especially the second one I purchased had a problem of sticking or being sticky while opening. Jerky almost. In fact, the second one stopped opening. It just closed more and more and then stuck in the closed position. I literally received the package from Amazon, tried it once, took it off 20 seconds later and it never opened again. Placed my return within 10 minutes of UPS leaving.  Final thoughts - In theory it's great. Just being able to place your desired pressure on the capo without a level and spring or tension bolt, is great...unfortunately these guys just haven't gotten the mechanics down on making this gig worthy. It's slim and light design makes it really desirable and I've desperately wanted this to work, but I'm afraid I can't trust it. Very disappointed.	-1
It's a bit of a hassle to put on and take off quickly. Not recommended if you have to change it up between songs unless you have plenty of time to get it on just right and verify it is tight enough so there is no string buzz or muted string. I keep it only as an emergency backup. I went back to using my Dunlop spring loaded capo, which works just fine and is quick and easy to put on, take off and move.	-1
I bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what I found is that although it looks cool, it's complicated (which for a capo is saying something). The release lever makes it difficult to get a good amount of pressure on the strings and nearly impossible to put it at the top of the guitar when not in use.  Bottom line: If you don't mind the extra effort and don't plan on keeping it on your guitar when not using, then maybe you will enjoy it. For everyone else, look elsewhere.	-1
This capo looks amazing, but it does not hold well. You cannot get the pressure of a Shubb or other similar capos. Consequently the sound it produces is not as clean. As has been said, this also contributes to other problems. The guitar does not stay in tune while using this capo and bending strings, or during hard strumming. It is also more expensive. I would send it back if it were worth my time. I would not recommend this capo or buy it again.	-1
First, this is a REALLY nicely built capo. Well-machined. Not cheap. Sexy curves and the joint is a thing of beauty. I've owned a couple for several years, but have now felt inclined to write this review.  However, there are a couple of issues:  #1 it is HEAVY---REALLY heavy...heavy enough to throw off the balance of your instrument if you're used to a specific one pay attention to these things. I've never had a capo that I had to worry about damaging my guitar, but this one is SO heavy that it can do serious damage if you drop it or scrape it against your guitar. It's a BIT slippery due to the "curves", so you WILL drop it sooner or later.  #2 it has a SMALL jaw size. There are lots of instruments I have (Martin acoustics and some big necked electrics) that I own that this thing just won't fit. I wish the company would issue "V.2" and widen the spacing to fit EVERYTHING, because this one is a deal killer for me, even though I've bought 2 of these capos over the years. I would also love for it to be MUCH lighter. I would like to have more angles to better grip the capo as well.  There should be WARNINGS about the necks this thing will fit, or better yet, remake the thing so it DOES fit everything...  Right now, I just cannot whole-heartedly recommend this capo. It makes a GREAT first impression; however, over time, the faults start showing up. BEWARE.	-1
Guess it's true what they say, you get what you pay for.  I didn't expect these speakers to be great but I did expect them to function.  Wrong.  Don't waste your money.  Power handling claims are a flat out lie.	-1
Powerful woofer, weak horn. Boomy sound for voice. I bought 4 and after 6 months one of them is sounding like AM radio. I drive them through a 100W behringer power amp.	-1
4 of the 6 screws that fasten the woofer to the .5" particleboard cabinet were stripped out, as a result the woofer dislodged from the cabinet, busted the cabinet, and left shards of particleboard everywhere. I found a .5" x. 5" tip of a utility knife inside one cabinet and a cracked vent-port from an over tightened screw on another. I was able to rotate the woofers 45 degrees, predrill, then fasten them securely to the cabinet. What really has me heated about these speakers is that the woofer dust caps were half-assed glued on and as a result, both woofers rattle really bad when playing music. Hopefully I can remove the woofer cone dust caps and properly glue them on (with a special glue that I have to order) to eliminate the rattle. I knew these speakers were not top of the line when ordering, but these things a nearly garbage. Amazon labels these speakers as "hazardous materials", so getting support from amazon is more than likely more trouble than its worth.	-1
Although a good value, my 1/4" plug would not engage securely in one of the 1/4" jacks.  I disassemble to find the jack was broken.  Rather than send it back, I purchased a jack from my local electronics store and replaced it.  It now works fine.  But my expectation is that these units would be inspected and tested.  Obviously, it was not.	-1
Ok truth is i bought 2 of these, the first 1 i got was packaged very well and when i went to plug up sounded even better, which is a great thing. Now my second one i recieved came to me broken and i sent back right away!!!! Good thing is that if u take good care of this monitor it will do good for u!!! Bad thing is that it was built very cheap which explains the price!!! The wood is very cheap wood and the plastic on the monitor is not very durable thats y i say u have to take real good care of it!!! Now if u bought this to be traveling with, then thats not a good idea but if u bought this for like a home studio or something where its not moving alot/at all, then u might be ok but i would not recommend this item!!!!	-1
I bought two of these recently and figured that for such a low price as long as sound came out of them, they would be worth it.  Regretfully, out of the box, one of them did not make any sound and had to be returned. The other remaining unit has some serious, basic issues.  The 1/4" jacks are wired so badly one jack was completely useless (because internally a wire crossed over in such a way to short anything plugged into it).  The other 1/4" jack was intermittent, mostly due to its inability to lock a cable into place inside it (because of cheap and flimsy connector parts). Lastly - the cheap material used to cover these speakers is damaged very easily, and after only a few shows has large scratches, holes and tears revealing the wood underneath.  They spared no cost-cutting trick to manufacture these marvels of the low-fi industry. I do not recommend these speakers - you would be better off taping your dollars together into a megaphone shape and shouting through them.	-1
Not the best.	-1
I've ordered 2 of these, at different times. In both cases, the speaker arrived firmly boxed up in multiple layers of cardboard. In both cases when I finally pulled the speaker out, the woofer literally fell out of the housing... the screws had ripped out of the pressboard. They didn't bother with 2 cent metal clips to prevent that. That isn't poor quality control, that's *no* quality control.  After I went to the trouble of cleaning up the mess, and epoxying the woofers in place (easier than shipping them back), they made an OK set of monitor speakers for a small PA.	-1
This microphone works with PylePro portable PA system decently, however, when hooked to a more professional system it fails miserably. whether wireless or wired it sounds as though you are in a tin can. Use as emergency back up only.	-1
Even if I were reviewing this as a wired mic (the product comes with a short cable to do so), I would only give it a 2. Very low volume in cable mode. But as a wireless mic, it is horrible. There is so much "white noise" inserted into the mix from the mic/receiver that it makes the karaoke DVDs/CDs sound like listening to a weak FM station with lots of hiss. I bought 2 of them - both exhibit the same poor performance. On top of that, the battery covers on both receiver units constantly fall off. Definitely not recommended.	-1
ITEM DOES NOT WORK AT ALL MOST OF THE TIME AND OTHER TIMES IT "MAY" WORK ON THE FOUR FIRST STRING ONLY, AND IS VERY SLOW. I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER.	-1
Could not figure out a way to clip it to my electric Skyinbow violin. Won't clip to pegs, won't clip to body, so couldn't really use. When I did get it to clip a few times (before it slipped off), I would play the note (with it set to violin) but nothing would register. Then when I stopped playing the note, suddenly the "A" or whichever string I had just played would light up, and it always showed a range--never a solid note (and yes, I was in tune). My ear works better than this tuner. A bandmate gave me a Snark, and it works MUCH better and stays clipped to the peg while I am tuning. When I tune, I tune the A, then do the other strings by ear, unless it is REALLY noisy. I double check everything with the tuner, and I am always spot on (and find this to be the case no matter which tuner I use, even an old school tuning fork). So the fact that this Intelli Tuner did not work for me indicates that it is no good. The reviews were good, so I was disappointed that it was a bad purchase.  Go with the inexpensive SNARK. It comes in a little bag you can tuck into your case, it seems to pick up minor tuning differences better, the head adjusts more easily and in more positions. The Intelli Tuner just didn't work as well.	-1
It's in a drawer somewhere.  Perhaps it's better than nothing, but was clunky, inaccurate, and never worked well in any way for me.	-1
Doesn't come with directions do we could never use it and 5 people we talked to couldn't figure it out either.	-1
This mic worked for 2 years then just DIED! It was never dropped or mishandled in anyway. It was kept in the case when not in use. What a piece of JUNK! Save your money! If I could give it ZERO stars I would.	-1
Mine never worked and I found out too late. I didn't open it until long after the return period was over. Total FAIL on my part, and shame on whoever made these piles of junk.	-1
My quick review of the MXL 770 is that it's not great--even for the price.  I purchased four of them and was disappointed.  Constant feedback issues, very "raw" sounding voice without any depth, picks up too much room sound, and "p's" pop even with a normal windscreen.  It's bad.  I really can't explain how some people recommend this for podcasting--they must not have tried out other competing mics in this price range.  I'm a podcasting addict and I've owned just about every popular podcasting mic on the market.  My review is comparing this mic to other mics, FOR PODCASTING (don't know the first thing about music recording).  Audio Technica ATR2100 - This mic is less expensive than the MXL 770 and in my opinion gives a SIGNIFICANTLY clearer sound.  On top of that, you get XLR AND USB options (although the xlr sounds a lot better than the usb--I tested it).  If you have more money and want something truly excellent, my "daily driver" mic is the Rode Procaster.  I've tested it against the Heil PR40 and for most voices I think it's an improvement.  Although, if you have a particularly whiny or thin voice then the Heil may be a better fit.  But those mics aren't comparable to the MXL 770 since they are much more expensive.  There are better options out there and you don't necessarily have to spend more money.	-1
Easily the worst product Evans has ever produced. Bought it, brought it home and installed on my kick to find out that it barely mutes it at all. Still too loud for any quiet convenient practice. My old Sound Percussion bass drum pad works much better even though the pedal chain rubs against it a bit due to using an EMAD head.	-1
I mean they do knock out the sound...but the cymbals  "feel" stiff and heavy. Ended up purchasing for Zildjian L80's...more expensive but does the trick	-1
I hate putting this on and taking it off in every lesson.  But it's the best lame solution that I've found so far.  And the sticks grab on it, so my students are constantly shifting it so they start making contact with the actual cymbal--Clank, Clank, Clank.  It cuts sound really well when they play directly on it, though.	-1
I bought this drum kick drum mute as part of the Evans Sound Off Pack, but I had to send the entire pack back due to this drum mute falling apart after two weeks. I exchanged it for a replacement of the same product, but the kick drum mute fell apart again after two weeks of use. I can't believe Evans even puts their name one such a cheaply made product. It does mute the sound for a week or two, but if you want something that works for the long term, look elsewhere.	-1
This doesn't do a good job muting the drums as I hoped.	-1
Did not come with the knob!	-1
BEWARE: The one I received looked slightly different, yet still marked as "OnStage MY300 SERIES", so not a 320, which may be better, but this thing is no "shock mount", being totally stiff with no hope of isolation. Vibration transmission is the same as solid clip. They did make 100% refund, so happy about that.	-1
The female 5/8 socket is not properly threaded and will strip your stand mounts.  Possibly a serious manufacturing problem w/ On Stage because I also bought an On Stage Mini Boom, and it has the same incorrect female thread spacing.  Returning both.  Stupid thing is that I also bought an MY325, and that 5/8 female thread spacing was fine.  note: I tested the fittings with various equipment, and am positive that the female 5/8 thread on this (and the mini boom) is bad.	-1
These pickups sound absolutely terrible.  The cheap pickups that were replaced sound better than these.  Wish I had of stayed with Fender.	-1
The slide is solid, but I just don't like it. My other slide is bigger on the inside and fits my fingers better. This one was a little small for my hands.	-1
it didn't do what I expected, but other musicians like it.	-1
Not for me, I could not get used to this product. But give it a try, perhaps is going to be better for you	-1
These picks are so thin that they bend rather than push the string.  Not for a serious picker that needs volume.  Not for banjo or resonator guitar,an amplified acoustic guitar, maybe.  I ended up giving away the pack I purchased, as they were not even usable for banjo picking.	-1
didnt work well for my yamaha and rocked for some strange reason.. i hated that	-1
The design is so poor that once set to the desired guitar position it will not posible to take it off because the loop gets too small.	-1
Don't understand how to use. Keeps falling off if you do not put lots of weight on the instrument.	-1
Works ok, but mine isn't finished one end is open for no reason	-1
not what i expected	-1
The item I received is crocked and bent so the stand will not stand level. I will be returning it.	-1
Wobbly	-1
This item arrived one screw short so I am unable to assemble it. Beware!	-1
The stand seemed fine but I could not assemble it because it did not come with screws to assemble the stand	-1
I got this in hopes of saving a few bucks vs a double. I put my Mixer on it and went to spin and it wobbled pretty bad, made me feel uneasy. My mixer is a DDJ-S1 and weighs only  20 pounds but it doesn't hold it securely. i recommend a double-X stand which i have several of and they provide a sturdy platform!	-1
The material is way too slick.  Because of the lack of friction any guitar that is neck heavy is going to move all over the place.	-1
After only 3 months of use the little black knob came off the end of the Pad Saver and left the whole fluffy part down inside our Tenor Saxophone. After the black knob came off the whole pad slid down inside the horn rendering it unplayable. We tried to use needle nose pliers to pull it out but they were not long enough to reach the pad.  After much frustration and many attempts I cut a piece of coat hanger, straightened it out, we attached some neodymium magnets to the end of the coat hanger and were able to get a grip on the metal center core of the pad, very slowly we drew it out of the horn, then threw it on the floor, stomped on it and cheered that the magnets worked.  We do live concerts and play at festivals, this would have killed us if we only had 20 minutes before show time and discovered this rotten pad had lost it's handle and slipped down into the horn making it completely unplayable.  Before it broke we liked it ok but after it broke in our horn with no notice we're taking it all the way down to 1-star. I would never store this in the horn, you never know when it's going to come apart and leave you with a job to figure out how to extract it. The little black part is poorly attached to the twisted metal core. I'm looking for a better quality replacement.  Good music to all!	-1
While these shove it style things are indeed effective in cleaning your horn, the problem with them is a simple lack of space in cases to store them elsewhere, preferably on the outside of your gig bag/case. When you leave these in the horn all the moisture stays in, causing pad rot and mold growth. A silk swab with a weight attached to it will do the trick, and your pads will thank you for it.  If you're a beginner, or buying for one, AVOID these.	-1
This was on my list of items to order from Amazon. (My instructor used this on a Saxophone that he rents.)  During the process of starting to select a Saxophone to buy a repair tech / player said "he personally"  would not use this product for the following reasons.  1st believe it or not this will remove moisture from the bore, but barely touches the pads. (Leaving them wet.)  Of course it will never touch the pads that are normally open.  2nd if you move this pad saver around in the Saxophone and then leave it in your instrument it keeps the moisture in the instrument. (Not good and I was told this would accelerate pad problems.)  3rd if you place use this product it and then take it out of the saxophone, eventually fibers will come off the swab and get into the Saxophone. (This can cause multiple problems.) One problem, that I was told about, is the pads developing "micro-leaks". (Fibers coming off is better or worse depending on the brand of the Pad-Saver.)  I was told this H.W. brand is one of the better Pad Saver brands. (But still not to use it.)	-1
I find it holds moisture if you leave it inside the mouth piece. Remove the reed and place the reed in a reed box. Run this through carefully and slowly. maybe twice. Place the mouth piece cover on and store the mouth piece in the case. Leave the saver where it can dry. It wasn't that expensive, so I thought I'd try it.  Be careful of what you shove down your Clarinet. The wire binder can do damage to the bore.	-1
The item is quite inferior, although the price should have allowed for better construction. The tiny rubber cap quickly slipped off the end of the heavy twisted wire, exposing the sharp ends and the rubber mouthpiece to damage. The tufts of the item quickly began to shed. I would not purchase this item again or recommend it	-1
These are large slip-ons for Manhassett stands that have the large, welded on type feet. They do not fit the newer Manhassett stands, like the Voyager, that have smaller feet that conveniently fold. The product description does not make this clear, and the photo is also misleading in this respect as it does not show how wide these things are. So, if you have a newer stand, make sure these will fit before buying them.	-1
The sound is not consistent.	-1
I got a pair of easily dented not-hardwood sticks that have a dull tone. Made in Thailand. Returned for refund.	-1
If I run this thing in and out of my tenor neck a couple times it come out wet.  However, if I follow up with a Hodge tenor silk swab, that comes out wet too.  If instead I start with the silk swab and then use the Neck Saver, the Neck Saver comes out dry.  It appears to be to be far less effective than the Hodge Silk swab.  I would have given it only one star but it is possible that if it sits in the neck, it would continue to wick moisture. (I think this is unlikely, but I don't know how to test it.)  However, given how much more moisture comes out with the silk swab I'm going to buy a second silk swab and use one for the neck and one for the body.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hodge-Tenor-Sax-Silk-Swab/dp/B0002F4YFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hodge Tenor Sax Silk Swab</a>	-1
I have used Elixirs for quite a while. I am a big fan of coated strings and succumbed to the hype on Cleartones.  What a disappointment!  First off they sound good as new strings but have quickly lost their sharp sound after a few days. Now they are starting to sound quite dull (one week). On original playing they turned my fingers black. Not a big deal and may be due to body chemistry. A big complaint: very annoying finger squeaks on the wound strings. (Not so with Elixirs.) They may last a long time but I'll never know as I will replace immediately with Elixirs. In summary:  mediocre sound, extremely difficult to control squeaking on wound strings, and not worth a premium price. I'm sorry I wasted time and money on these strings.	-1
It was suggested that I try the Cleartone strings, but having used Elixr PB for a while now, these strings fall short of my expectations. They are not as bright as Elixr and seem to have more diffculty staying in  tune. Gave them a try but now they're coming off.	-1
Counterfeit!!!  Internal packages clearly state "Made in USA", overwrap has "Made in China" barcode sticker, and D'Addario states string code has already been registered.  Reported to D'Addario and Amazon!	-1
