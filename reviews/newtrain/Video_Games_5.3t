okay i heard all the bad things about the game. but i thought nah it cant really be that bad, people are just expecting too much. well i was wrong, the game is that bad. and i tried so very very hard to like it. i love sports games and was addicted to nfl2k religiously, so when i heard sega was doing a baseball game i was waiting desperatly for it.   unfortunatly it doesn't come close to even triple play 99. the graphics are at times very very good, but  they have a tendency to repeat the same things all the time. the pitcher does the same thing on the mound every time.   the biggest problem is gameplay, it doesnt really have any. when you look at other baseball games out there on other systems this is sad. dreamcast has something to prove to both the people who have bought it and to psx addicts. that we havn't made a mistake in buying and supporting the system. but with a title as bad as this it doesn't help the cause.   the commentary is the flatest, dullest most braindead there is. the difference in quality between nfl2k and ws2k1 is huge. nfl2k is a very cool game and nfl2k1 looks even better. if this game had been to its standard we would have had something to really write about.   now my hope goes to espn baseball early next year.	-1
Well, the graphics are amazing and the batter pitcher interface is smooth  and well thought out.  The rest, however, should have been worked on a  little more. The greatest strength is by far the pitcher batter  match-up.  When playing against another player, the game simulates reality  very well.  The pitcher can set up the batter like in a real baseball game.  You can throw a fast ball high and tight, and then fake the batter by  going low and inside with a change up. The biggest problem I have is that  about half of all at-bats are pop-ups to the infield.  The rest are  harmless grounders or strikeouts.  This game is incredibly difficult to hit  with, and makes it lack really any playability. Other problems are that  stats are not readily available at the end of a game, the sound is  reminiscent of a bad Genesis game, controlling runners is a pain, and there  is not much control on defense. This game is like an untested prospect,  lots of potential, but not really ready for the big time.  Best to wait for  World Series 2002, if the Dreamcast can survive that long.	-1
Shenmue is an epic game, a masterpiece, a must have. Is weird as this sounds, its a combonation of Zelda and Crazy Taxi. This is a must own for Dreamcast owners. Its possibly the most realstic game ever. Get this game now!	1
This game is a good game, not great just good.  The graphics were state of the art a few years ago, but still pretty nice.  Sound is ok.  The control of the character is a bit cumbersome.  Nice game, although not FIVE stars, I would recommend it.	1
Look, I'm no expert at baseball games, so I may not have noticed some of the mistakes Sega made, but I did notice a couple:1. You can't control the  fielding until the computer catches the ball (then you can control the  player throwing it),2. The replays are repetitive and boring, but at least  you can turn them off. 3. Throwing the ball to the bases is kind of tough  because instead of pushing buttons that resemble bases like in other  Baseball games, you have to put the analog in the direction of the base,  hold it there, and press A. Besides those problems, I liked the game.  And it wasen't as bad as some people say it is. So rent it to see if you  like it or not. Don't let these bad reviews stop you from trying the game.	1
Shenmue is one of the best graphics games ive ever played on dreamcast. You get to go and fight a group of angels that are mad (lol). I think this should be one of the best games for dreamcast except one thing made it so incredibly stuped. DUH! The game is way too short. 3 discs should be alot but they are not. This game is about Ryo Hazuki from the Hazuki Dojo in Yamanose. His father was murdered by the secret man Lan di sama. He is Ryo's main target for revenge so he tries to kill him. (And for people who want to fight him you don't get too). Lan Di will not fight you until a girl named SHENHUA Jona meets you and you destroy him. There are 16 Shenmues if im correct. This game is great but its too short. And the weather and time are very accurate.	1
Ever since the launch of the Dreamcast, I've been hearing about a game called Shenmue. I've seen screenshots, first impressions, and previews. When it finally came somewhere around 2000 (hey ! You can't expect me to know all these things !), Sega has proven to RPG fans that it would become the future of RPG's. In Yu Suzuki's latest creation, you will play as main character, Ryo Hazuki in his quest for Revenge for the death of his father. Shenmue is an interactive game that keeps track of the times, changes, and events. For example: if Christmas was only weeks away, someone would be dressed as Santa Claus and some houses and stores would be covered up in Christmas decerations. Okay, that's enough. Now lets talk about how the game is like. First off, the graphics are flawlessly detailed. Some characters don't show much facial expressions, but most of the time, they'll make a slight twitch or an expression even. The sound is...uh...not bad. There's some catchy '80s style tunes (No ! We're not talking about Billy Idol or Aerosmith's music ! It's Sega's customizable '80s music) you'll hear when you go to a bar, somewhere around the outdoors, anywhere ! The voice acting is kinda horrible. Ryo's voice sounds great, but most of them are straight-up annoying ! The more I kept hearing Goro use his squeaky voice, I press the B-button to skip it so I can hear Ryo's. The gameplay and controls are cool. Controling the character isn't really that hard, if you have already played RPG's similar to Shenmue. Some people would complain how slow and unresponsive it is, but it's actually easy (that's what you get for playing to much corny adventure games, kid !). The best part of the gameplay are the QTE battles and the freestyle battles, where you can duke it out with neighborhood gangs and mad locals. The storyline is seamless...until Disc 3. The storyline on Disc's 1 and 2 have great stories, but Disc 3's story lags a bit. Most of the time, you have to race daily, everytime you got to work and after the race is done, you have to do some work as a forklifter. Wow...fun (sarcasm) ! There are times when you'll encounter a fight on Disc 3 (I love beating the tar out of the Mad Angels at the Yokosuka Harbor), which turns Disc 3 slightly exciting. And the most exciting part is, you get to play classic Sega arcade games like Hang On and Space Harrier (100 yen a game). So in the end, Shenmue turns out to be a perfect gaming experience for RPG fans. This game is so great, even some of those ignorant PS2 lovin' Dreamcast haters will give this pup a go. If you want to be taken back to the '80s again, Shenmue won't dissapoint.	1
I can't wait for the sequel I've had this since if first came out and I am still findings new things to do.	1
This game has one thing that's a brilliant idea and a very frustrating flaw at the same time: the time-mechanism. It really makes the game feel alive but sometimes I'd wish it wasn't there. Why? We'll get to that later... Let's start off with the graphics. I don't know why, but they really looked "Playstationish" to me, but in a higher resolution. Bad? Not at all! What I mean by this is that it's got highly detailed graphics and, playstation-playstation :), very impressive facialanimations. The downside is that the graphics are a bit rough, especially when you compare it to something like Soul Calibur or Sonic... nevertheless I'd give it 8,5 out of 10. Sound. Very uhm... Japanese! Or let's say stereotype Japanese-Americangibberish :) Yes, voiceacting is pretty bad and the voiceactors' lines don't really help them either. Music is OK but sound overall could've been a lot better... Now let's get to the most interesting part, the gameplay. It's very intriguing because of the real-time gameplay but frustrated the hell out of me sometimes as I said before. I'll give an example. Ryo (that's the maincharacter ;) walks very far to see someone. But, you are a minute too late and he'll say he's too tired. Then you have to go to bed and walk there all over again, and it adds up to 30 minutes in real life! Yes it's realistic, but it isn't FUN, and isn't that the main purpose of a game? This game really has an interesting idea, rather involving gameplay but something that, thank God, will be ironed out in part 2. And if they do that then there's 5 stars from me to collect :)	1
This game has great graphics, of course; but the game play is equally reciprocated.  In this game you are only allowed to throw and hit.  All the  excitement of robbing your opponent of a home run with a stellar catch or a  taking away a base hit with a diving catch is taken away.  You cannot play  defense at all!  Your job is to throw in the right direction, but that is  even tasking because the response time is so slow that you have to press  the throw button repeatedly.  Even if you get the throw off in time, your  player receiving the throw will take a couple seconds before he finally  attempts to make a tag; and by then it's obviously too late.  Speaking of  delayed reactions, the commentary is too monotonous and belongs with the  ranks of Genesis games.  I would take the classic, "Bases  Loaded", over this junk any day.	-1
THe first amazing elements that jump out at you as soon as you play this game is that Shenmue's awesome graphics and the vastness of the world you play this game in.  The technology of Shenmue is simply amazing, and helps the game span many genres of video games.  After playing the game I also thoroughly enjoyed its story and charectors.  For the most part this game plays like an RPG, but also includes bits that are racing, fighting, and speed tapping of buttons (I really don't know what genre that would be).  This combination of genres kinda hurts Shenmue because it includes them all, but truely masters none of them.  Finally, my biggiest complaint is that although the game is three discs long, it is actually quite a short game to beat.  I still recommend this game as a must play game for Dreamcast owners.	1
You play as Ryo Hazuki, a kind of shady young Japanese man in 1986 Yokozuka Japan. You must spent 12 to 15 hours a day "in game time" searching for clues to find his father's killer. I'll make a quick pro & con type of review:Pros: 1. You can play old arcade games ranging from "hang-on", darts, Punch-out 1 & 2. 2. Sparring with the guy in Ryo's dojo. 3. A daily five dollar allowance. 4. The forklift job is easy and fun. 5. The 70 man battle minigame is playable upon finishing the game. Cons: 1. You don't acually meet Ling Sha Hua, the girl who is in the opening sequence, who is in China. 2. Ryo is a more offensive fighter than defensive fighter. 3. The snow doesn't stick to the ground. 4. The in-game timer moves at almost an hour per minute. 5. The replay value is low unless you care for the actual weather. Buy the stategy guide for this game if you don't want to miss out on anything!	1
before i write my review i whant to get this straight shenmue is one of the greatest adventure/RPG's there are. First of all the graphics are crystal clear the plot and the fighting scenes are excellent and besides maybe not being enough fight scenes at points in the game this game is great. What else can you ask for i mean with know bad parts in the game this game is one of the dreamcast greats.	1
The game has great graphics and and very smooth gameplay but, the biggest problem with it is that you cant even field so when the CPU hits teh ball  you can just sit there and wait for the CPU on your side to get it. It  gives me the feeling of little control. The pitching could be better. I  mean come on you got this little circle with lines pointing off of it in  different directions you have to look in the book for WSB 2K1 to find out  which pitch is which. The aiming thing to bat. I hate that even though they  do have a cheat for it. Well I think they could have done a hell of a lot  better.	-1
The game has fantastic graphics,perhaps the best graphics on Dreamcast to date. But the gameplay leaves something to be desired. Although the fighting sequences are really good,the game gets boring sometimes. Ryo(the character) asking all people the same question,"did you see a black car that day?" feels a little boring. So this is not an addictive game .Overtall Sega has done quite well but the "somewhat boring gameplay" takes a lot away from what would have been a classic game.	1
There are some one-star reviews of this game. There are many more four- and five-star reviews, mainly because the kind of person you need to be to rate Shenmue 1 star doesn't often have the attention span necessary to write an entire Amazon review. This is where a lot of people are going wrong reviewing this game. They spend a few hours cluelessly wandering around, not using the Notebook which *tells you* what you're looking for now, not going to the fortune teller in Dobuita who *gives you clues*, not using their own mental processes to *think* about what Ryo should be doing, and on the basis of this conclude that it sucks. Not true. Usually the next piece of information can be found in a matter of minutes, letting you ever closer to the action sequences - Virtua Fighter style fights with up to 70 enemies (Shenmue was originally planned as a Virtua Fighter RPG), QTE reaction tests, movie cutscenes that can be amazingly realistic at times, minigames like forklift and motorcycle riding, arcade games (play Space Harrier all over again!), etc. Even mundane things like going shopping, feeding a pet cat, using vending machines.  There's enough to do. Now: the voice acting. The voice acting ranges from fantstic (Ryo, Nozomi, Chen Gui Zhang) to terrible (some passersby, children). Note that most of the important voices are great. It's almost a formula: the less plot-important a character, the worse their voice. Desperate loser Goro is a real overactor. But then in RL desperate losers *do* overact to impress. Why four stars? I'd like 4 1/2. But it is rather too easy (can't "Game Over" at all). It's also relatively short. But what is there is absolutely beautiful. The final disc in particular made my jaw hit the ground on more than one occasion. My final "day" of game time left a mark. Just like the final scenes episode of the final episode of your favourite TV show, you could tell: "This is it. This is ending, and soon." It's beautiful. If you read this far, congratulations! You have the attention span Shenmue would like you to have. Go buy. Now.	1
Shenmue takes place in Japan circa 1986. Lan Di, a warrior comes to Ryo's father's dojo in search of a mirror. Ryo's father refuses to give Lan Di the mirror, while Ryo finds out his father killed someone in battle a long time ago. Since he didn't give Lan Di the mirror he killed his father. Ryo sets off in an adventure to avenge revenge on Lan Di. Awesome game! Superb graphics, high detail. My only con about Shenmue is you have to walk around too much. A great mix of fighting, adventure, and RPG. Great job Sega! Lets hope Shenmue 2 is just as good!~	1
Shen Mue has received rave reviews from almost every on-line site and magazine that I have come across. But interestingly enough, almost every reader board I have seen on-line has expressed a very different opinion: This game was terribly disappointing. I'm an RPG fan, so I'm used to running around towns and talking to people, but when you're FORCED to do this for HOURS on end without any action, it gets tedious...and more tedious...and frustrating...and finally, you want to throw your Dreamcast out the window! I honestly think that the only reason this game received such great reviews was simply because it was one of the first RPGs on Dreamcast. Now that Grandia II, Phantasy Star, and Skies of Arcadia have been released, RPG-lovers have a MUCH better selection to choose from. Pick up one of those great games instead, and don't even bother with Shen Mue. From start to finish, it's just one big disappointment after another...	-1
Well I thought I was getting sooooooo much more after all the hype, but honestly this was just plain boring. Pretty to look at, but shoddy controls and not enough fun stuff to do. mostly running around talking to npcs[non player characters]and opening doors looking for npcs. YAWN!!!!!!!!Yes it looks pretty but unless you like long drawn out storys and watching a game more then playing skip it .....	-1
This is the worst baseball game I ever played. I had moreenjoyment reading the negative reviews on this than actually playing this game. Every negative review about this game is 100% correct. The only good thing about this is graphics. Game play stinks (I don't want the computer fielding for me or running bases)and what ever happen to the infield fly rule. I was cought up in 5 tripple plays because the batter popped up in the infield with two men on base. This is crazy!  A total waist of money. I'm putting this game up for sale after only having it for 1 day. ... Sega need to be sued for false advertisment. Most of the info on the back of this game is false. No hot or cold zones, no 32 different pitches (if there is, the game book doesn't tell you how to throw them), can't control base running, the men on base are running on every hit ball no matter what base they're on or the amount of outs in the inning. SEGA, CAN I GET MY MONEY BACK AND AT A 10% INCREASE OF FUNDS FOR PUTTING UP WITH THIS FOR A DAY. Pedro, I like you as a Red Sox Pitcher but disappointed that you got your face on the cover of this game. oNe	-1
Shenmue is an incredible experience right from the start. I just got the game on Sunday, and today, friday, i am just completing the 1st out of 3 disks. My advice to you is, don't believe what many people are saying about this being a boring game. It is actually one of the most addicting gaming experiences I have ever had... I play this more than I played Zelda 64. Sound:9/10 The sound is fantastic. I love how the tone of the music reflects what is happening in the game... In a tense situation, the music adjusts accordingly. One point off, however, for the sometimes annoying music at Ryo's residence. Controls:9/10 A lot of people don't like the controls at first. They are awkward, but after about a half hour of playing it will be like second nature. At this point, I wouldn't change them even if I could. Graphics:10/10 The best graphics on any console. Playstation 2 has so far been unable to match it. No detail is left out. Gameplay: 10/10 This is where Shenmue goes from being a good game to a fantastic one. The storyline pulls you in and doesn't let you go. Replay Value: 9/10 I haven't finished the game yet, but I can tell you right now that I will play it again. The storyline is one you would like to see repeated, and it is virtually impossible to do everything the first time through. RPG's however, eventually get old... but that is what Shenmue II is for! Even if the series is never completed... even if Shenmue II is the final chapter, I will never regret having played this game and will play it again and again. Reviewer's Tilt: 10/10 Overall score: 9.5/10 Folks, Shenmue is the reason enough to warrant the  on a Dreamcast. No true gamer should miss out on this experience. After completing the game, I will be sure to give you my final thoughts. By then, all of you should by this game!	1
For those not in the know, this is the Dreamcast's hype equivalent of, say, Metal Gear Solid.  The one game that is supposed to pick you up and knock your socks clean off.  And it does that, but not with constant action, fighting, or gun-blazing battle scenes. This is an exploration game, very much in the vein of the old Sierra games like King's Quest, Police Quest, and Space Quest.  It is less of a "beat em up" than a "talk and walk."  Because that is basically what you do: talk to person A, get a hint as to who person B is and where to find them, then take a walk to find person B.  There are little diversions along the way, such as taking care of a kitten, buying everything from canned soda to little toy trinkets, interacting with the largest set of characters ever seen in a video game, and more. The action comes in 2 forms: either TQE scenes, which are twitch reaction events that demand you hurry and press a button that appears on screen, and the other is the actual fighting sequences, where you use various moves to battle differing amounts of enemies.  The action is fairly few and far between, and you will spend most of your time walking and talking.  There is training time, but since it is not normally against an opponent, the action there is minimal. What made this game so jaw-dropping for me was the scope of it all.  You roam from city to city, meeting dozens of different people, all with their own personalities, visiting dozens of buildings and shops, each with its own flavor and purpose, and manipulating dozens of objects.  I give the game's creator (and all-around Sega mastermind) Yu Suzuki a world's worth of credit because coordinating all of the aspects of this game must have been a nightmare!  And to think this is only part 1 of 4! Complaints?  Well, compared to Metal Gear Solid, the voice acting in Shenmue is... well... laughably bad.  It could have really made you feel like you were living a fantastic movie, but the absolute wooden stiffness that the lines are delivered with along with their interminable slowness ("Hi...Ryo... how...are...you...today?") really ruin the awesome sense of realism that remains otherwise intact. The only other complaint from me is the stubborn control.  In most games such as this, up always walks you forward.  In Shenmue, whichever way you point the digital pad is the way you move.  This makes for some maddeningly uneven & unpredictable movements.  Luckily, due to the slow, exploratory pace of the game, the only place where the molasses control becomes truly infuriating is during the scant battle sequences. But, control and translation issues aside, this game addicted me like no illegal narcotic ever could.  You don't ever want to put it down.  Every event leads to another event, with more areas to explore and people to interact with.  The game is fairly easy to beat, but a game like this is meant to be an enlightening exploration experience, not a frustrating "do the same board 20  times just to get it right" kinda thing.  It really took me back to an era of simpler games, with epic storylines, and expansive worlds to explore.  I had more fun with this than with almost any other game in recent memory (all the way back to Metal Gear Solid on PSX.)  A landmark achievement that will most likely be one day crowned "Best Dreamcast Title Ever."	1
I was amazed from the very beginning.  breath taking graphics fluent motion and great sound.  the largest assortment of interactive characters then any other game (around 300+). Along with the top notch visuals and sound, Shenmue told a great story as well.  Revenge, honor, and love are all mixed into this great game.  I recommend this game to anyone.  And no lie, once you begin to play you will not be able to stop till your done.  Can't wait till the next one comes out.  Hours of great realistic game play, almost begin to wonder witch life is yours.	1
I recently wrote a review for Shenmue and I realize that my judgment was completely premature. I hadn't completed the game yet. In fact, I wasn't very far. Anyway, this game, though frustrating at times (trying to find people, etc.) is amazing. The graphics are crystal clear, control is great, fights are awesome, and the realism is unparalleled. People exist in Shenmue as they do in the real world. You have friends, enemies, and strangers that go about their lives and aren't concerned with yours. My personal favorite parts of the game include the following: 1.) Your job at the harbor. Driving a forklift is so cool! Plus, you race with your co-workers everyday before you begin your work. You are supposed to move crates around to different warehouses. It's pretty fun really... 2.) Real-time battles. I think there should be a Shemue fighting game because I loved these battles. There's nothing quite like getting in a fight with six people and using your moves you've learned from friends to beat the ... out of all of them. 3.) The instantaneous judgment situations. At certain parts of the game, a button will flash on the screen, and if you don't press the button you will (for example) get punched in the face. So, in conclusion, kudos to Yu Suzuki and everyone at Sega of America, inc. You've done a great job!	1
I have a library that covers over 30 Dreamcast games, and I would have to say that this one impresses me the most.  This adventure brings any gamer closer to realism than she or he has ever been.  Dialogues do not have to be read, but they are heard; and you feel like a third party member eavesdropping on a conversation every time the main character engages in one.  The graphics are not the only reason why I am impressed so much, but the fact that it spans all genres is incredible!  If you like fighting games, there instances where you can beat up some thugs; or if you like racing you can hop on a motorcycle and burn rubber.  Feel like gambling or playing pool, it is there; and if you want to go back to some classic Sega Master System games you can.  This is a must buy because it is the best game of its type that has ever been created, and it is the most revolutionary for all of its attention to detail.  This game is a must buy for any gamer.	1
I was all pumped up about Dreamcast's first baseball game. I went out and reserved the game. Bought it the day it came out, and found out that it was  a huge disappointment!  I've only played it twice so far, but I could tell  that they were in a hurry to get this game out! First of all, THERE's IS NO  HOMERUN DERBY in the game!  If you think about it, ALMOST ALL baseball  games have a home run derby. Why doesn't this game have one?  Another huge  let down was that this game only allows up to 2 players. That's pretty sad,  considering NBA2000 and NFL2000 gives you the ability of up to 4 players. I  also found that it was unusual that you have to hold down the "R"  button then release it to hit the ball. Also, PacBell park doesn't look  like the real one. The only thing that the game has going for it so far is  the graphics. It is by far superior then any other baseball game out there.  Now keep in mind that these were the things I caught after only playing it  twice. It probably has tons of glitches such as NBA2000 and NFL2000. Don't  get me wrong, there all great games, but they need to stop putting out  games in a hurry!	-1
I just got this game yesturday and I must say the graphics are amazing. The roster is even so updated that David Justice is on the Yankees. The  main problems are the slow down in graphics if too many people are on base,  sometimes causing you to get out. The other main problem is that your base  runners run even if your guy hit a pop fly, causing a double play for the  comp. NO FIELDING I might add! The comp controls your outfielders but you  throw the ball to your choice base. This is a good game for baseball fans.  The season mode is fun, but there is no home run derby(boo hoo). If your  not sure you will like this game, at least rent it. Thanks for your time.	1
Unlike some ignorant gamers, my opinion is 100% fair and unbiased. I have no favorite between Nintendo, Sega and Sony, and I never will. I'm a hardcore gamer--I play games to play games, that's all. The only reason I mention this is because everybody seems to be throwing that "fanboy" word around at anyone who shares their opinion on a game, Shenmue particularly (just look at some of these reviews). With that said, onto my review: If you're a gamer, you've already heard it all about Shenmue--some love it, some hate it. EVERY gamer has an opinion on this game now... And I just so happen to love it. First things first: Shenmue is NOT the best game ever like it was hyped up to be, it's not the best 3D game ever like Next Generation thinks it is, it's not the best Dreamcast game so far, and it's not even the game of the year. What Shenmue is, however, is Yu Suzuki's new groundbreaking masterpiece that could have been at the top of all those best of lists if it wasn't crippled with numerous minor problems. This game is pretty flawed... so much so, I don't even know where to begin. I guess my biggest complaint would be the control. It definitely takes awhile to get used to, as it's not very accurate or precise, it's a bit on the sluggish side, and sometimes it's overly responsive. The control isn't the worst ever, and I've played games that are worst (Parasite Eve just sprang to mind...), but it could have been so much better, too. My second biggest complaint would be the voice acting. In one word--horrible! If you thought Resident Evil was bad, you haven't heard nothing yet. Goro's line of "What's groovin', bro?" is the single dumbest line in video game history. But despite the voice acting being awful, it also has that it's-so-bad-it's-addicting quality to it that Resident Evil does. There's the option of just reading the text, yet, I never used it. The voice acting is so bad that it kept me wanting more. I wouldn't say that it's so bad it's good, because it isn't. Instead it's just hilarious. It's like those classic kung fu flicks. Don't get me wrong, I wish the voice acting was done by real professionals, but at least there's humor in the game. The music would be my next complaint. I've never really been a huge fan of video game music, and Shenmue reminds me as to why I probably never will be. Most of it is snooze material, while the rest isn't enough to be classified as music. Falling somewhere between the stuff you hear in an elevator and *shudder* J-Pop, Shenmue is a prime example of just why video game music won't--and, for the love of all things musical, shouldn't--ever appeal to that outside of its game realm. What makes this even sadder is the fact that you can buy cassette tapes in the game and then hear the .... My favorite part of the game was fighting. Sadly, there weren't as many fights as you'd think there would be. Also, and while this won't apply to some, I found the game easy. Clue A leads directly to clue B which points right at clue C and so on. And if all that isn't bad enough, I didn't see anything in the way of replay value either. Now, I can overlook all that stuff, IF the game itself is that good. And, let me tell you, it sure is. The story goes a little something like this: Arriving at his home, Ryo Hazuki realizes that something's not right as he looks around at the entrance. The doors are wide open, a sign is smashed, and there's a mysterious black car as well. As he goes in, he finds his friends have been beat up. When he walks into the dojo, his father, Iwao, and a mysterious man are at odds. The man is asking for a mirror that Iwao keeps refusing to hand over. Iwao and the man fight and Iwao is knocked down. As Ryo tries to interfere, the man uses Ryo's life as a trade for the mirror. After he is told where the mirror is, Ryo is free, and then the man and Iwao fight again, this time Iwao was dealt a devastating blow that kills him. And as the game says: "And thus, the saga begins..." Original? No; nobody is these days, but effective and enthralling? Very. The first thing you'll notice about this game is the freedom you have. You can search through drawers, turn off lights, train in the dojo, play classic Yu Suzuki games in your living room (Hang On and Space Harrier, to be specific), take pictures off the walls, and even use the telephone... and to think, that's just the stuff you can do at Ryo's house! Wait until you get outside. You can interact with anyone, go to the arcade (darts and QTE Title were my favorites), feed a cat, shop 'til you drop (you can buy everything from little toys to a bag of chips), drink soft drinks or coffee, and you even get a job! Actually, forget what I said earlier, the first thing you'll notice isn't the freedom, but the graphics. It honestly wouldn't surprise me if Yu Suzuki came out and said he hired a small third world company to work on the graphics alone for this game. The graphics are by far and away the best of any console game yet. PS2 doesn't have anything this good looking on its system, and it will be awhile before it does, too. Graphics certainly don't make or break a game, but they are a nice bonus, and even those jaded gamers who sneer will be drooling like a dog after seeing the eye candy this game has in store. Simply put--anyone who tries to tell you the graphics aren't impressive is a fool and/or liar. My favorite aspect to the game is the fighting system, or more specifically, the fights. The fighting system is surprisingly deep, with a lot of moves to learn and master. You have your standard punch, kick and throw moves, but it goes beyond that in depth. You can uncover moves by practicing, having them taught to you, or by buying them. But when it comes down to fighting itself, there's nothing like it. The fighting system is like Tekken or Virtua Fighter, but completely free roaming; you can run behid someone if you want. You more often than not fight numerous opponents, and this also makes things tricky as you could be fighting more than one person at the same time. Then there's the Dragon's Lair-esque parts of the game, or as they're called here, QTE (Quick Timer Events). For those that never played Dragon's Lair, the point of the game was to quickly press certain buttons at a certain time of event. For instance, when you're about to get hit, the A button may flash in the middle of your screen for you to push. If you don't do it quickly enough, well, you get hit. Simple as that. This happens quite often, and it's pretty fun, actually. Later in the game, you even get a job at the harbor moving crates. Riding around on your forklift is funner than you think, especially since you're work is often interrupted by a certain gang... And while I didn't love all the characters, I did like some a lot. Ryo, of course, and Master Chen's son (yeah, I forgot his name, sue me). Hype has a way of destroying a game. Just look at Metal Gear Solid (read: very overrated). And Shenmue is a flawed game. It's not perfect. It's short, and the ending just leaves it open to its second chapter, but it's a groundbreaking masterpiece that every gamer must play nonetheless.	1
This game is seriously cool, it has a very involving plot, and AMAZING graphics.  There is an overwhelming amount of speech in the game, and most of the voice acting is pretty good.  The battle system is very exciting, and works a lot like a fighting game, like virtua fighter.  It is very original. The game has some strong(ish) language later on in it, though, so it shouldn't really be for kids. It's also a little easy, but since they are coming out with like nine more sequels it's ok.  A very awesome game though.	1
Shenmue is graphics, voice, music, and a totally original gameplay experience. Imagine being able to literally pickup, manipulate, or view almost every inch of your gaming world. You can even pick up pictures off the wall for no reason at all in most cases. Or play games at the local arcade, real 80's games like HangOn. Then go get a job at the harbor driving a forklift for a company and getting paid. Then add it the character interaction and motorcycle driving and all the little mini adventures that paint this world full of different genres from racing to fighting to rpg this game has it all. Such a compelling storyline driven by the murder of your father by a Chinese martial arts guru that wears fine silk clothes with a dragon design. The game is exceptional. It covers 3 GD ROMs but the game comes with 4, the fourth disc is a biography and character info as well as alot of other extra stuff that really is icing on the cake for a great game.	1
Shenmu is an absolutely astonishing game.  The graphics are the best i have ever seen on the dreamcast, so if this is a starter for things to come then they have made me well happy.  The game has loads of detail in it from the proper sized shadow to the sky changing depending on the time of day and the real time factor.  There are plenty different ways to go and there are plenty of people there to help you as you go along, but there also people who won't be happy with you for asking them questions.  The fight sequences are one of the best parts of the game, and learning moves as you go along was also one of my favourite parts.  I also enjoyed the added touch that sega had added with the arcade games i loved playing some of the old classics.  This is the game that no dreamcast should be without.	1
This is a good game, but not a great one. I hate to say it (because I like the loose concept of the game), but I was disappointed with Shenmue. I have to give recognition to the fine artistry and graphical quality. However, herein lies the problem. So much emphasis was put on the graphics that they forgot to add the game. Shenmue really isn't a video game at all. It is more like you are watching a movie and every once and awhile you have to pause it, do some tedious task, and then you get to watch a little more. You really don't feel like part of the game. It often felt to me that I was not playing at all, but watching someone else play. I kept waiting my turn, and before I got my turn the game was over. This problem was also exemplified by the fact that you can not die (lose, be killed, whatever you choose to call it). I don't know about you, but I like a bit of a challenge. Not even having Ryo's fate in my hands made me feel even more like a bystander. One other problem I have (probably the most significant to me) is that after all that "playing" you find out that you are just going to have to wait for the next video game to see what happens. You can form your own opinions about that, but I have to admit that I felt a bit taken. I just wanted to play a game. I didn't sign up for some long-term deal where I would have to buy several sets of discs to find out what happens. They should call the game Shenmue: Chapter One. At least then you would know that your entire [money] is going to only one chapter and not an entire game. If you want to see some great graphics and casually watch one chapter of a story unfold, then this game is for you. However, if you want a challenge, the possibility of losing, a game that may come out differently if you were to play it again, I don't think Shenmue is for you. I recommend Half-Life and Final Fantasy 9 for many hours of video game enjoyment. Happy gaming.	-1
There is only one word to describe this game: Awesome!!!  This game has everything from a highly detailed 3D world unlike anything I've seen in a game!!!  Ever!  An awsome plot that makes you WANT to keep playing as much as you can so you can unlock the the rest of the story AS SOON AS YOU CAN!!!!!  "Magic Weather" and "Time Control" make this game even more life-like than most RPG's (Even though this game has RPG element's in it)!!!  And the QTE is something we've NEVER seen in a video game before!  Which makes this game more original than others.  Now some complain that the game is too slow, and for some it might come out like that.  This game is NOT for everyone!!!  However I think everyone should get the chance to play it and try something unlike any game we've played before!  Although I do find it annoying that this is only "Chapter 1" and we have 15 more chapters to go untill the game is compleat!  Which means we have to empty out a lot of pocket money to play the whole game!  But other than that this is a great game that should be played by EVERYONE!!!  And remember, it's only on Dreamcast!  Take THAT Sony!!!!!	1
Shenmue was a great experience.  Even if you're a total lunkhead and can't follow the plotline, there are so many ways to pick up additional clues without leaving the game itself.  The 'practice' system of improvement is stunningly realistic, if a bit boring at times.  I'd love to wait through and see the seasons pass (there was a guy in a Santa Suit on the streets at Christmas).  On the other hand, the game, while great in plot, mechanics and stunning visuals...was painfully short.  I flew through the discs and finished in no time.  There's a lot I missed, of course, but still, it would be nice to have more subquests.	1
This is the sort of game that should have come out on the DC ages ago. Spectacular graphics, an interesting story and a great concept.   the game does have some problems still, but they are not big enough to diminish the enjoyment this game brings.   If you can avoid all the hype and just play the game on its merits and hopefully we will see more games of this calibure being released.	1
Shenmue is simply something that every Dreamcast owner HAS to experience.  This is to say that there's no gaurentee he/she will LIKE it.... The game is an RPG-style game with occasional Virtual Fighter-style fights, along with some Dragon's Lair-type button responses.  There's even a few arcade sequences to add flavor. The story is very well presented- the main character "Ryo" is on a quest to avenge his father's death.  Along the way both exciting and mundane events occupy Ryo's time, from fighting rival biker gangs to helping a young girl with her kitty.  The story is rich and by the 3rd disk it may become your life. A couple words of warning- the game is rather short.  It can be finished in 20 to 25 hours of gameplay.  To me this is a plus, to others it might be a negative.  Also, the voice acted is, for the most part, horrible.  There are moments where the voice performance can be effective, but these moments are few.  This is something the player has to get used to or it will drive them crazy.  Parents note- there is a fair amount of violence (the fighting sequences) and a few 4 letter words towards the end of the adventure.  Final note- the box for this game says "The Experience Begins...".  Without giving too much away, those looking for a complete story might be dissapointed. In spite of this, Shenmue is one of the best gaming experiences I've had all year.  Like a good book, the game lives on beyond the time spent playing it.  I recommend every Dreamcast owner to give it a shot and see if they can make it past the game's shortcomings.	1
With all of the hype surrounding this game, I thought it would be a whole lot better than this. Of course by now you've heard about the great graphics. Okay, I'll give you that, but I want a game not a movie, so I care about how it plays and that's where 'Shenmue' falters. The gameplay consists of punch-punch-kick style action and at times it's restricted to you hitting one button along with the movie scene. 'Yawn'. I actually dropped off a little during part of it; no joke. While it is certainly a technical achievement, it's more movie than game.	-1
I have to hand it to Yu Suzuki and Sega.  Their games may not be immediate classics, but they are clearly groundbreaking, and players will look back at them and say "wow, I can't believe this game was that inventive". I've played Shenmue for only a few days, and I have to say it's one of the best games I've ever played.  The quality and attention to graphic detail is stunning.  Clearly, when you're looking at some characters' face it's hard to imagine that they are made up of polygons. Twitch gamers will not be happy.  If you're in for a quick, visceral fix you'll be disappointed.  But if you like exploring, like seeing what's behind the corner or underneath that tricycle or even what's in someone's desktop drawer, you will be estatic. Shenmue is just one of those games you can sit down and play.  Play and play.  Even without following the plotline to the tee, you can still do a million things. If you have a Dreamcast buy Shenmue.  If you don't have a Dreamcast, do yourself a favor and get one.  This game, and many others (hint, hint, NFL2K1, hint) are definitely worth it.	1
One reviewer already said he prefers Metal Gear to Shenmue so if that's your cup of tea then maybe this game isn't for you. But taken from an rpg/reality simulation game, this game is the best so far. You have to train and discover new fighting moves on your own. At times there are QT scenes where you gotta react instinctively for certain events to unfold. How many out there were too slow at first and managed to get the ball to hit the little girl? ;) You can raise a little cat while you're on your adventures. There's just alot of little mini things that may or may not have anything to do with the plot which makes this interesting. So, if you're the type that just wants to blow stuff up and likes a fast paced game, then Shenmue isn't for you. But if you're like me and love little distractions and have patience, then this game is great. Heck, I once spent 15 minutes just stalking one guy in Tenchu and that was fun for me. Of course, the game isn't perfect. There are little flaws like the dialogue becoming repetitive at times, not being able to skip certain scenes you've been thru before, or my biggest gripe..no analog control. It does get a bit inconvenient at times when you're in a cramped space and only have digital control. But still, this game definitely ranks up there as one of the great games. But like every great game, it might not be your cup of tea. If you don't like a particular type of game, why buy into the hype? That would be like me buying Madden when everyone says it's one of the greatest games, but I don't give a care about sports games.	1
Wario is back in yet another game.  Don't get me wrong, this is the best and biggest one yet.  There are four different sections to advance to, and  after you beat a level, you could unlock one of four treasures found in  every level.  Don't worry, if you get frustrated, you can always go back to  the temple to ask the mysterious figure where you should go next.  Besides  a weird storyline, Warioland 3 boasts many different moves including being  turned into a vampire or a ball of string.  Besides these, there are all  the familiar points of the game, but Warioland 3 adds a new minigolf game  to open passageways.  This is a good buy for a fan of Nintendo	1
This has got to be the worst game ever. I have nothing good to say about this game. The scenes, the graphics, the sounds, they are all BAD. Lucas should just stick to what he does best, Direct!!	-1
This game is exciting at first because the first few tracks are easy and it gets you comfortable with your racing style until the much harder tracks come along. I happen to be a big Star Wars fan and the pod racing sequence was essential in the movie. I have this game on PC already and decided to dish out [the money] for the Dreamcast version. It's pretty much the same, I wish we could play this game online. The bottom line is that I wouldn't say it's the best racing game out there but if you're a Star Wars fan that likes to race at simulated speeds in excess of 400mph+ then ... seems like a wise investment.	1
Very pleased! Arrived sooner than expected! Worked great!	1
Wario Land Games for the Game Boy Advance SP - I am going to discuss three of them. Wario Land II, Wario Land 3 and Wario Land 4.  These are classic, wonderful, wonderful games!  This particular cassette arrived in very good shape.  I ordered three or 4 each from the separate, available vendors and all arrived well in time. All are excellent.  I first learned of these Wario Land Games by spending many months learning, on my own, through the Wario Land 4 cartridges that I bought as people traded them in at Video Game stores. When the kids were getting older and ready for more aggressive fare, I suppose.  I loved buying them and seeing how far along the original owner had - had not - gotten.  I bought  a bunch of them while they were still available as I realized that it would only be a matter of time before the newer and newer games and consoles would cause these to not only become unavailable, but possibly unappreciated for the wonderful things they are. Not one of these former owners ever even had a clue that in addition to the "normal" version and the "hard" version, there is a Super Hard Version.  The amount of skills it takes to complete correctly the series in order to continue....are not written down anywhere that I could find.  There are helps on the Internet, but these people make assumptions that all gamers talk to each other and therefore learn what they need to know that no one can perhaps figure out. They leave out a lot.  I (at 75) had to figure them out for myself.  My wonderful childhood was wholesome and much less fast-paced...safer for playing out of doors, for example.....having an hour to walk home, eat lunch and walk back to school...today this is unheard of. But these games are an excellent preparation for today's hurried world.  The amount of coordination needed is tremendous.  I have learned not only this coordination, but patience (sometimes you must do something over and over and over and over), perseverance (and over and over more times yet) to get your timing right - discipline, and creative concepts that require to think like a kid!  Only then did I go back to try the Wario Land II and Wario Land 3 games.  Oh, my heavens! The Wario Land 4 really seemed easy by comparison.  Every technique that I had to teach myself to master in that set of games was originated in II and 3.  The characters are different and the stories different but I would have been lost without doing Wario Land 4 first.  It at least gave me a chance. The difference between II and 3 is that in II Wario has all his skills available.  It becomes impossible, just at the very last game, at least for me. Most important is that none of these games kills off the character.  You get to try and try and try until you succeed or throw the thing at a bed or a chair!  Then you try some more.  I don't know about it developing one's character, but all of the above disciplines do indeed get improved. And I bought two cartridges of the original and two cartridges of the later developed more up-dated cartridges of the Wario Land II.. The Wario Land II progresses logically.  The Wario Land 3 is maddening.  If it had not been for Penaldan (German?) I would never have EVER been able to progress anywhere!  Without achieving a certain treasure within a certain territory, you can not proceed to any other territory! You do not proceed in an expected typical order, but must achieve certain things at different locations. Blaziken 257 - turns out to be the name of a previous game's  fiery Pokmon character.  So I am thinking that the company put out these You Tube videos. I have written down the order for the 101 Episodes.  Without this "bible" there is no way to know how to proceed to succeed in the entire sequence.  And I do not understand how one person could so flawlessly execute these for us as examples.  I am a well-coordinated person.  It took me free time as I found it (a lot!) for over two days, for example, to master the  one skill to achieve what seemed impossible.  And this has occurred repeatedly, for each new skill to be accomplished.  The Game Boy little compacts fit in a pocket, they hold  charge for hours and they are exquisite. I pocket one whenever we go anywhere "just in case" there might be a few minutes to play and then store the progress until another convenient time.  In our lives we are playing in four community bands, teaching private lessons, working on our Victorian house and a few other things.  We eat out a lot. Life is grand.  just because these did not exist when we were kids, does not mean that we can not enjoy them.  I feel sorry for the fuddy-duddies who look on at me with disgust - well...actually, just one person - who thinks that I am wasting my time!  If so, it is mine to waste.  If you live as long as I have, you know what car repairs cost, what food costs, where things are heading in this country and in the world.  It is lovely to just stop time for a while, and play a Wario Land game where the character never dies! nancy morse	1
I remember my friend who had wario land (mario land 3) an it was aswome! Then later i wanted to get the game but they didn't have it funcoland (gamestop)and wario land didn't come out yet (not even a gba, i was like 9 when this happened and im 12 now) an i had a blast when buying a used copy of this game! it has awsome graphics and the only thing wario land 4 beats this game on is the music but they both have cool music an i may have liked this the most over 1 but i hate the insanly difficult golf thing! it drives me mad! i beat all wario land games (my friend has 1 an 2 an i have 3 an 4 lol) an ya they are all great so even if u only have 1 warioland game an cant possibly get the others, just have fun with it! Pros. Perdy visuals fun puzzles immortal longer than other warioland games (when u get ALL treasures) turn into different stuff fun replay story easy to understand whether you have the instructions guide or not an story has fun twists (you will NEVER guess who the last boss is) CONS hard golf mini game can drive any player crazy collecting all treasures is fun to do again an again (bring on the road/planetrips) ... Get this game wether u played a wario land game or not end of story!	1
The concept of making Wario immortal was, in my opinion, a stroke of genius, and handled flawlessly in Warioland 2. In this game, however, it wears thin very quickly, especially in the Boss battles, where one hit is often enough to send Wario flying off the screen, making it almost impossible to beat any given boss in less then seven tries. The game's level design must've looked good on paper, but is very poorly executed. You must go through each stage four or five times to find all the keys, chests and tresaures. Time of day is factored as well, and after finding a tresure almost every stage in the game is radically changed. For example, find the seeds in one level, and now there are huge vines growing everywhere in the levels you've already completed, allowing access to new areas and items. It can get very repetitives very quickly. Also, for some reason, Warioland 3 has the worst graphics of the series. The first game even looks better. Backgrounds are almost nonexistant, textures are bland, and, although this game was the first made specifically for the Game Boy Color, Wario is made up of only two colors. Huh? On top of all of this, you must track down your abilities, which Wario seems to have lost since the end of the last game. While this system worked wonders in Metroid Fusion, it's tedious and unnecissary in this game, the weakest of the otherwise outstanding Wario series.	-1
I own this game and it's really a great. Before warioland4 was in stores this game was the best. If you don't have this game get it. It is a long game. This game is almost like Super Mario World. But the difference is that it's in a different area and and also it has a different plot. If you played warioland1 in the days it was being sold you would have thought it was the best game ever that no game could have been better than it. But, if you played Warioland3 after you played Warioland1 you could have thought that game was more better. So if i was you i would have bought it right away.	1
I have this about a year out of the five i have it my fovorite good graphs for 8 bits and be besy colecting all 100 treuses so there lot to do and funny reactions like geting flat as pan cake if he  get on fire he start to run around .	1
Wario Land 3 is a great game for any fan of game Boy or of Super Mario. The game is basically like and Mario game, with different boards and many creatures to defeat throughout many worlds. When I first started to play the game I noticed that the graphics were pretty good for a Game Boy. Another great thing about this game is that you can save, a thing that some Game Boy games don't have these days. So, want a fun game that you know you will enjoy. Try this, Wario Land 3. I know you will enjoy this game. Just trust me. HAPPY GAMING!	1
Okay, so I bought two other 'off-brand' controller's in the past.  Sure they were slightly cheaper, but so was thier construction.  Within months of hardcore gaming, the two sub-par controller's now lie in an electronic graveyard because certain buttons no longer respond. The solution: spend the extra few dollars and get an official controller.  The construction is solid.  My orginal controller's from Nintento still work! Now about the Ice Funtastic color:  Pretty cool, even though there is a slight green tint to it.  At first I though I was shipped the wrong one...maybe the 'Jungle' motif, but it is indeed Ice.  Happy Gaming!!	1
A used original Nintendo brand N64 controllers is far superior than a new aftermarket brand controller. I've tried a few aftermarket brands and they end up falling apart (literally) are otherwise breaking while my used original Nintendo brand controllers still function. The main weak point of any original Nintendo brand N64 controller is the stick. This is almost always the part to fail, so much that sellers know a "firm stick" is a selling point. There is no question as to whether this will happen, but how long until you have to fix it... No worries, when your stick gets loose, buy a stick replacement. Replacing the stick is far less troublesome then some of the issues I've faced with the aftermarket brands. Completely satisfied with this purchase.	1
The kids use it and love it, so there isn't really much more to say than that...  Ice Blue is the perfect color.	1
My kids dug out our old N64 console and we realized we were missing a controller.  We purchased this and it seems to work just fine.  My Tiger Woods golf skills haven't faded much and we had a blast with it the other night.  If you need an additional controller this will do the trick.  I'm not a huge gamer so I can't comment as well as others by offering comparisons to other products, but overall it appears to be a solid product.	1
If you have to save money than buy it used but DO NOT buy an X-brand. Only Nintendo brand controllers are worth your money.	1
Lord Blazer is a game breaker, but it has a great storyline, one I actually remember unlike Wild Arms One!	1
love it great deal	1
Thanks again	1
Excellent game	1
this is a very good game. it arived in very good shape and played fine. i like this better them wild arms one.	1
I don't know how, but when these games originally came out, I never really noticed them.  Now, I'm delving back into this older series.  I already finished Wild Arms 1 and thought it was a decent game, so here I am, ready to start number 2!  Will it be as good as or even better than the original?  Let's find out!  Graphics (score 6/10): Well, the graphics are certainly a step up from the original Wild Arms, which were quite primitive for the time.  The problem, of course, is that while these graphics are better, they are still quite primitive-looking for the time this was released (2000, which was the same year are Final Fantasy IX).  Now, it may not be fair to compare this game to a game that no doubt had bajillionty-tons of money poured into it.  Still, it does look rather dated for it's time, and if you don't believe me, just look up some screen shots of the game.  On the bright side, the intro animation for both discs is done in a nice anime style (which as we all know is timeless and classic and ages well).  Too bad we never see those anime cutscenes ever again!  Music (score 7/10): The music is decent.  It's what I'd expect from a decent RPG, but it's not spectacular or anything.  The only tracks that really stood out to me were the Western-sounding whistle-y intro music on the startup of both discs.  Those were awesome, bu the rest of the soundtrack is pretty standard fare.  I certainly wouldn't run out and buy the soundtrack, but nothing grated on my ears and I felt it was good enough to push the game's scenes along.  No problems here.  Characters (score 7/10): You start off with three main characters (Ashley, Brad and Lilka).  You play a prologue section to introduce each in turn.  Later, three more characters will join the party, but it takes a rather long time for them to join.  These characters are not too bad, they all have decent backstories to them, but I did feel that they could've used a bit more unique personality to them.  Still, they weren't the worst characters I've ever experienced.  I won't say they are the most memorable characters or the MOST interesting, but they are good enough to carry the game.  The only real complaint I have is that a lot of the dialogue feels "off" somehow, as though it's been poorly translated or something.  There are lots of points of dialogue that had me scratching my head in confusion, and this hurt the characterization.  Now, that was the main characters, so what about the villains?  Well, these aren't the absolute worst villains ever, but the game makes the horrible mistake of having villains that only explain their motivations right before they die, thus having almost no development (yeah, I'm talking about all the Cocytus members).  As for the main villain, you do get to know a bit more about him, but he still comes across as a bit shallow.  Well, that's all I am going to say on that to avoid any spoilers.  Story (score 7/10): I'd have to say the story here is actually a bit better than the one in the the first Wild Arms game.  It feels like there's a bit more to it.  You start off in typical Wild Arms fashion by playing a small introductory segment with the three different main characters before they finally meet up for some common objective.  These segments serve to introduce the backstory for each main character quite well.  So what was that common objective they were meeting up for?  Well, it turns out that they have been recruited by a weird old rich Noble guy to be a special fighting force to solve problems in the world.  As I'm sure you can imagine, this leads to them saving the whole world in typical RPG fashion.  However, there are plenty of twists and turns (that I'm not going to give away) that keeps things interesting.  Although it's not the greatest RPG story ever conceived of or told, I'm pleased enough with it.  On a side note, for anyone wondering if this game is a chronological sequel to the first Wild Arms, the answer to your question is: I don't know.  It does seem to be set in the world of Filgaia, and has lots of references to the original, as though it could chronologically take place 300 years in the future or something.  It's rather hard to tell if that's the case, or if the developers just wanted to drop in a bunch of references for fun but didn't intend it to be a direct sequel.  I just don't know.  Now, there is one last thing to discuss...  I don't know exactly why, but this game's pacing feels really sluggish.  Even though I was mostly enjoying myself, I kept feeling like the game was dragging on and on (weird, I know).  I don't know if the plot just moves too slowly or if there's too much filler, but I kept feeling like I'd been playing 40 hours already, then looked at the in-game clock to see it'd only been 26 hours.  I mostly enjoyed myself, but the game could've been trimmed down a bit and not suffered for it.  Battle System (score 7/10): If you've played the first Wild Arms, this battle system should seem very familiar to you.  If you haven't played the first game, then you might be initially a bit confused.  The battle menu appears as a series of little squares arranged in a "cross" shape.  I find this irritating because I'd prefer proper words instead of tiny pictures.  Anyway, if you press and hold the Triangle button, it'll tell you what each symbol means.  Once you get used to that, it's just your basic menu-driven RPG.  You have an attack command, item command, the ability to use special moves, etc.  One nifty feature is that when you're walking around and get into a random battle, if you press the Square button or the O button quickly enough, you can sometimes avoid the battle altogether.  That's pretty cool.  The only real difference from the first game (and many other RPGs in general) is how the magic casting works.  In Wild Arms, there's this thing called FP.  It's built up during battle by getting hit and performing attacks and it's used mostly to perform special moves.  In Wild Arms 2, magic is also treated as a special move requiring the use of FP instead of the traditional MP system that almost every other RPG uses.  While this is rather nifty because you can't run out of MP in the middle of a dungeon anymore, it's also bad because you can't use any magic (especially healing magic) outside of battle.  While this was a bit irritating at first (due to my being used to the typical MP system) I eventually got used to it and it didn't' bother me anymore.  Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  I was hoping I wouldn't see this again, but unfortunately, the stupid dashing system makes a return.  Basically, if you hold the X button, your character will dash forward.  You cannot control what direction they run in until you either release the button or they crash stupidly into a wall.  It's really irritating when every other RPG on the planet just lets you run like a normal person.  Speaking of running, there's no analog control for this game, despite it coming out late in the Playstation's lifespan.  That's just ridiculous!  On top of that irritant, there's also the issue of diagonal movement.  There are several points in the game where you need to specifically angle your character diagonally (often on a tiny narrow path that you can fall off of) in order to shoot something.  It's very difficult to do this with the arrow pad and no proper analog control, which is quite irritating.  I have realized, though, that you can move the camera angle to point towards the target at an angle, and this makes it infinitely easier to angle yourself properly (this feature wasn't present in the original Wild Arms).  It's still rather irritating though.  Oh, and while I'm on the subject of irritating game design, let's talk about the "Search function".  You cannot see towns and stuff on the overworld map like a normal game.  You have to press the Square button every few steps before the town you're looking for will appear.  As if that weren't annoying enough, the town/dungeon you're looking for won't even appear unless you've spoken to a specific NPC or read a sign or something telling you about that place.  I don't know who thought this mechanic was a good idea, but they were clearly insane!  This is one of the most tedious and pointless game mechanics I've come across in a long time and it shouldn't have been done!  Sigh, well, that's all my complaints.  To be fair, the rest of the gameplay is fine enough, but those annoyances really stand out to me.  Overall (score 7/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  I'd have to say that I really enjoyed myself with this game overall, and that's it's a bit better than the original Wild Arms, at least in the story.  Anyway, if you're a fan of RPGs and are looking to reach into the ancient backlog of the PS1, then go ahead and give Wild Arms 2 a try; you'll probably enjoy yourself!	1
Wild Arms 2 is a nice addition to the famous Wild West fantasy series, but many may not find this as western as the other two. The lack of wild west aspect (save for the wild west music and towns) makes it seem somewhat stale in comparison to the first one and doesn't even compete with the third one. The game's battle system is easy to follow, but the monsters are a step up from the previous game's creatures. More than not, many monsters are faster than your group and abuse that advantage to no avail. The equipping of Guardians to boost parameters and gain an extra ability in battle is a welcome addition to combat and the use of ARMS (special artillery like the ones Rudy used in WA1) makes for some nice gunmetal action. Crest magic is back and comes with more features, including special rare crests that can cut the FP cost for magic or increase the power by 1.5 times. That and the fact you have six members makes this a more engrossing WA than the other two. Each character develops nicely even though one might expect more considering the game's length. If you want to do EVERYTHING in this WA, you're looking to clock in over 70 hours of gameplay.  However, this game is not without its one major flaw: the translation. Practically every line uttered by Ashley and Co. sounds very strange. Why? The game was translated word for word from Japanese which many who know the language know it's going to come out sounding very unusual in English. This has been this game's biggest gripe for everyone and discourages some from even playing it. I admit it was bizarre at first, but that didn't stop me from beating the game. If you can get around this problem, the game is fine.  The music is top notch, full of the usual wild west you demand from this series along with sad, happy, goofy, mysterious, serious and dark themes. It's all in here.  If the translation won't bug you, I would recommend getting this WA highly, especially if you haven't touched it yet. You might miss out on one of the better PSX RPGs of its time.	1
Wild Arms 2, like most sequels, would have the incredibly hard task of following the series dynamite debut back in 1997. While many think that sequels never attain the level of the original (thus the theory of diminishing returns) Wild Arms 2 holds up pretty well overall, but doesn't really break any new ground for the series.  Graphically, Wild Arms 2 pretty much follows in the path of its predecessor in that the game has it high and lows. Environments such as towns, dungeons and world map are now completely 3D, unlike the first game, and are very well done with lots of detail - as one would expect a last generation PSX title. Unfortunately, like the original, the graphics in the battle scenes are still behind the times (that's somewhat of an understatement). While they are better than first game's, you can tell that this element of the game probably recieved the least attention from the development team. While they're not horrible, it leaves you wondering what could have been.  Story-wise, Wild Arms 2 delivers another interesting and engrosing tale as the original did, even though this time it does take a little but longer for things to get rolling, but not to the point as in Star Ocean: The 2nd Story. However, once the story gets going, their is no turning back (the story is the main reason I like this game the way I do - it has some great twists).  Character development is strong as well, but not as strong as in the first installment. This is probably due to the fact you get 6 characters (1 is hidden) in this game in contrast to having just three characters in the first game. Having more characters means having less time to spend developing each one, but is a VERY welcome change from the first game and is a trade-off that works in favor of the game. I only wish that they empolyed this in Wild Arms 3.  As for battle system, Wild Arms 2 ditches magic points in exchange for the force point system. Overall, this works pretty well, but they're are more than a few occasions where you wish your abilties used MP instead FP. This is especially apparent when fighting the optional foes. Due to the fact a character loses all their FP when knocked out, their are points you'll find you can't defend or cast anything upon revival until you build up more FP. More often than not against the optional foes, they'll knock you into subbmission before you can build your FP back up. This isn't as big of problem with fighters as it is with mage-type characters, who rely on thier FP to cast spells.  Wild Arms 2 is also the hardest out of the three Wild Arms games. There is no duplication trick like the first game and you CANNOT buy Goat Dolls (an automatic revive upon knock-out item) as in Wild Arms. This and the situaution with the force points system makes the extra boss battles in Wild Arms 2 much harder than anything found in Wild Arms and Wild Arms 3. Basically, there is no easy solutions to some of the optional battles in WA2, you just gotta use pure skill, or dumb luck.  While not an amazing game or sequel, Wild Arms 2 is well crafted game worthy of any RPG freak or gamer's playing hours.	1
I bought this game the day it was released, which was a very long time ago. I am not sure why I am reviewing this game now, but it might have something to do with the fact that I am playing it again, and am almost done with it. Pros: Putting this as simple as possible, this game is by far one of the most "interesting" rpg's I have ever played...right behind Vagrant Story. The cinematic videos in this game are wonderful, and are fun to watch. There are six characters to choose from and play with throught the game, instead of just three from the original. On top of that, you get to play with one of the guardians, the gardian of desire, in one part of the game. In part one, there was a story about the blade of disaster, and the legendary sword maggess, and in this game, you get to actually use her for a short period. This game has alot of history and story in it. The game time to finish, is around 35 to 40 hours, if you rush through it. You will generally finish at about level 47 with your main character. If you want to finish the game, beating everything and leveling up completely, you will be at 99 hours plus, and will take you such a long time, that you probably will not want to finish it that way. This gives alot of diversity to the gamers...it just depends on what type of gamer you are. The new battle system dealing with Fighting Points(FP), is unique, and never been tried before in any game. And, all the characters specialize in such unique techiniques, it will be hard to choose who your main party of three will be. Cons: The graphics dealing with the world have been lessened from the original. The music is not as breathtaking as the original, but still good. And, the puzzles are not nearly as hard as the first game. In the original Wild Arms, there was a place called, De Le Metalica, and within this place, the puzzles were so hard, you wanted to quit before finishing it. In this game, there are a few hard puzzles, and a couple impossible ones, but the only way to get to them, is to go out of your way, and spend time working on things that are not required to beat the game. To find hidden bosses..etc. Overall, this game is wonderful. I am about 10 hours away from beating this game with everything done. I am at level 97 and all my characters are incredibly high in power. When I finish this task, I am open to any questions about the game, anyone has. I have found many things that the strategy guides don't have. (The only reason I am using one...is because I have already beat this game about 15 times) I won't help you unless you are really stuck. :) ENJOY!!!	1
When you look at the instruction manual it seems as though three characters are the only characters you can control through to the end.  In a lot of other RPGs, characters other than main ones are considered as 'sub-characters' and they usually stay in your party for certain length.  But instead, so-called 'sub's are as important to the game as the main ones. I thought the game captured a lot of human dramas such as 'love', 'trust', 'friendship' and 'importantce of each individual'.  I really liked the way each character's personality was revealed and developed throughout the game.  This includes finding out about their own identity, strengths and weaknesses, what friends are for and many others. In terms of gameplay, it is reletively easier than the first WA.  3D rotation enables you to view the map from different angles which helps to find hidden secrets.  This concept is very similar to Dragon Warrior 7. I found puzzles very easy and hardly had any trouble getting through any of them.  I think the puzzles from WA1 are lot harder and clever than WA2. Music is slightly better than the last one, but it still sounds repeatitive especially when you are solving puzzles.  Animated movies are played each time you load the game, which are different depending on which disc you are on. Personal skills are very useful when you are struggling with certain bosses but they are relatively easy to beat.  The other new feature is a player can decide whether or not to go into battles with some exceptions.  This can be very useful when you want to get through the dungeon or get to certain places more quickly but the downside of it is, it can become a bad habbit, therefore you may need to spend a quite a lot of time building up your characters. It is very shameful that the game does not support analog controller, although it could make things a little bit more difficult at certain spots. This game has very good storyline and the gameplay is easy to learn.  Just keep in mind that this was released in 1997 in Japan, so do not expect great graphics.	1
That's right this RPG is good. Although overshadowed by the famous Final Fantasy series (it's so sad that so many good RPG's are overshadowed by some of SquareSoft's bad ones) it stands on two strong feet. It plays kinda like SaGa Frontier one put not really. There are 3 characters, Ashley, Brad, and Lilke and you choose which character to play as as you go through the game. However your character will keep changing until all three get together to form one party. The battle system is ok, not great. The basic enemies become very easy to kill in one turn making this a relatively easier game.  The bosses have been divided up into different hit zones, a la Vagrant Story. If you "kill" a sub-part of the boss you get extra experience and money than if you just killed it outright. A nice idea. If a boss is giving you trouble you can just kill it quickly or you can lengthen the battle by taking it out piece by piece. When it loses a body part it also loses an attack. Players will be reminded of the Reactor battle in Parasite Eve 2. The Boss battles, however, have a nasty tendency to be fairly easy as well.  There are special attacks that the character can do when it gets enough FP and these can be cool or they can be really dumb. It's your decision. The nice thing about FP though is that it doesn't go away if you use a simple skill, only if you use one of the four character skills and your base starting FP goes up with your level. Example: at level 23 when a battle starts you will have 23 FP. Some I never understood why they were there so I never used them. Wild Arms also has summoned monsters in the form of creatures called Mediums that you attach to your character and you can summon them in battle if a certain character was in your party. The music is really cool. There is a nice spanish-sounding trumpet during the beginning anime of the game. Although I think only music lovers will know what a spanish trumpet sounds like. The only negative about the music is that the tracks are awfully repetitive to the point where it repeats itself ever 20-30 seconds. Bad parts. Game really should be analog not digital. I have a strong belief that RPGs and action games should be analog now-a-days and anything less is kinda sad. I would understand if it was made in 1998 or 1999 but this was made in 2000, late 2000 if I remember correctly not only that but the game is in XenoGears-like 3-D. Analog is not an option but a nessecity. Other than the control, the items should of been described. Some are self explanatory (gee I wonder what a healing nut does?) other's you sit and look and go "I don't know what that does." They really should of described the items rather than forcing you to hold the triangle button, since it doesn't prompt you on the screen to press it for describtion. There is also a system called searching. Towns, castles, dungoens and what-have-you are not shown on screen.  You have to find them using a little dinky radar-type thing.  This could make things go on forever if you have to search out a town in a giant desert (this does happen too).  And now for a random thought. All the bosses have really cool names attached to them. Like, 'The Garanguatuan Little Piggy Eater Grandol.' This one's made up but that is what they look like. I just thought that it was funny. Why don't other game bosses have funny names? (stupid question I know).	1
I bought this game as my first addition to my Game Boy Color unit, and it is awesome! The gameplay is challenging and entertaining, and the graphics are incredible! I suggest that you buy this game.	1
The original Donkey Kong Country has the best sound and graphics on the SNES and it is safe to say the same for this GBC version. (it also may be the must fun for Game Boy Color) The only problem is that an autosave replaces candys save point as the way to save which makes it a bit easy but that doesn't matter. Either this or Super Mario Bros DX is the best GBC title. Anyone who fell in love with Donkey Country like I did must get this.	1
love it.	1
Awesome! Exactly what I wanted!!	1
Good.	1
Let me start off by saying that I am a huge nintendo fan and the DK games are some of my all time favs. DK country on the super nes is a true platform classic.  Now when I heard that game was being ported to the GBC I was excited.  I remembered how great the DK Land games were on the gameboy, so I knew that this game would be just as good.   The moment I got this for my birthday, I hurridly popped it into my gameboy.  The game at first seemed alright, the sprites and graphics during gameplay Looked Like crap and moved super stiffly.  Even the older DK Land games had better physics.  But I chugged along with the game, upon getting further in the game I just couldn't take it anymore, the crappy gameplay got to me enough, I could not play it anymore, it kept pissing me off, this was nowhere near as fun as the supernes version.   In the end I ended up throwing the cartridge against the wall.  Be smart and stay away from this piece of junk, go buy the GBA version or supernes version or buy it off the VC.  I Love DK but this game is pure garbage.	-1
In a world where there were CDs, companies like Sega and 3DO had tried to capitalize on the concept of playing video games on a CD, giving the games enhanced graphics and sound. There is one company, however, named Nintendo, and it created Donkey Kong Country. Donkey Kong Country was a game that proved that you don't need CD-based technology to make games with flashy graphics. You just need to put in effort to fit it to your console. And years went by, it was ported to the 8-Bit Game Boy Color. Did it make the transition well? Well, the Donkey Kong Land games were great, so maybe this one would be good.  DKC's graphics were incredible on the Super Nintendo. The game almost looked like the characters came from a CGI movie. At least, at its time. Even the backgrounds had tons of details and neat movements. Here, on the Game Boy Color, the graphics are still very colorful and greatly detailed.  The sounds and music were memorable. Even when you defeat a Kremling (alligator enemy), his voice effect when he dies will always be remembered for a long time. As for the music, well, you can never go wrong with the sweet beats of Kongo Jungle and the King K. Rool boss battle.  The game is one of those games that show the characters on a map before actually going into the levels. Once you go to a level, you're gonna be expecting barrel-blasting, Kremling-smashing, animal-romping fun! There is a lot to do in Donkey Kong Country. As a platformer, it doesn't disappoint with its gameplay. You can even find and play as an Animal Buddy, like a rhino or an ostrich. Rhinos can knock everybody out of its way, while the Ostrich guides you safely across the level. It can also float in the air like Racoon Mario in Super Mario Bros 3. The entire game is a bunch of fun.  Unlike the original Super Nintendo version, this game can save anytime. So where does that lead Candy's Save Point to? It just so turns out that it became a bonus game area. Thank god you can now autosave. I kinda don't like having to struggle through a level just to get to the save point. Either I have to reach there or lose all of my lives. Now that that's out of the way, I can save the trouble for hard levels easily.  Overall, this is a really great Game Boy Color game. It's WELL worth the money.	1
I owned this game when i got a game boy advance and I can tell you: IT SUCKED!!!  Graphics 0/10- Terrible Graphics. Even an arcade game would have better graphics. other GBC Games would have better graphics. I am disgusted.  Music 0/10- They screwed up the music and put other stuff in the game.  Game Play -5/1000- harder and less fun.  Overall -5,000,000/10- Stay away from it.	-1
My little brother has this game. I played his, and it is just like the SNES game. I LOVE it. I have got to get one. If you have a game boy and love the SNES Donkey Kong Country One then this game is a MUST have.	1
This is a terrific game. It is unfair to compare it to other NES versions of the game. For the game boy color, this has the best graphics I have seen. The game play is great it holds my attention for hours. I am 32 year old adult. I love to take my Game Boy on business trips. This game has memory too so you can save the level you are on and go back later. You can save up to 3 different games in memory. There are also special features with little mini games. You can play in 4 languages. And there are special features for Game Boy Camera and the Game Boy Printer. I don't have these but my son does.	1
Donkey Kong is one of the best games to grace the Gameboy.  Admitidly it has less colours than its counterpart but the gameplay is amazing.  Donkey Kong is a must have game, there is so much fun to have with this game and there are loads of levels to complete so it willlast you a long time.  Hidden within the levels are secret areas which you have to find if you want to fully completely finish the game, that is where the real challenge lies.  Buy this game ASAP and you won't stop playing for a long time.  Enjoy!!!!!	1
I played Donkey Kong Country to death on the SNES, and I loved it so much back then that I bought this GBC version to see if it could live up to it, and it did! I immediately became addicted to it all over again- it's almost exactly like the original. The graphics & sound are not as good, but afer all, it's the gameplay that counts. Donkey & Diddy Kong can still bounce on tires, ride ostriches, rhinos & frogs, collect golden bananas, ride on runaway mine carts, cartwheel through enemies and swing on vines. If you've never played the original version, then you'd better get this one to see what you missed - it's an all-time classic Nintendo game, and definitely a must-have Game Boy game as well.	1
Even though i finished the SNES version, it is to long ago to remmember, so it's like playing a new game. Graphics are great, gameplay that is very addictive. Everyone should get this game	1
This game is a must-have for Sega and Dreamcast fans. There are so many great things about it, but it boils down to a punkish Tony Hawk with great music, interesting story and fantastic cel-shaded graphics	1
I wanted this game for at least 2 years, and after just getting it, I gotta say, the graphics & soundtrack get a perfect 10, but control wise & camera, its a 6/10  IGN wasn't lying (BIG suprise) when they said it takes weeks to get used to the controls, they're kinda unresponsove in some areas, especially while grinding on walls. as is the camera control, it is a pretty frustrating game to me, but the music & Cel shading almost make up for it.  its kinda hard to recommend it, and kinda easy. Im a gamer who needs tight controls in order to get the most, graphics aren't a huge issue, but this game has a certain charm that I love, like the japanese symbols and tokyo vibe to it. like worthwhile collectibles and art galleries, if you're lucky enough to get the internet working on it, im sure its awesome	1
Was factory sealed, day one brand new. Took me back to the old Dreamcast days.	1
If you own a Dreamcast, you have to give this game a try. If you liked the Tony Hawk games but want something a bit more ridiculous and silly, then this is probably something you'll enjoy.	1
The style of this game, the cell shading, the Tokyo street life, the ultra coolness.  It's the must have Dreamcast game, but now you can get it on xbox live for your 360.  I'd say yeah, the 360 version is better, but c'mon you gotta have this classic for the Dreamcast if your an old school game hoarding junkie.	1
Ho...ly...crap. That is the BEST Dreamcast game I own out of my collection (only 3 games, but who cares?)! The graphics are great, the gameplay is great, control is great, and camera angle is great! The plot is really interesting, too. The game gives you great challenge and sometimes it gives gamers a little dose of game rage. This is a great game for a great price (I got a used version). If you have a Dreamcast, BUY THIS GAME. It's well worth it...	1
This game is one of the Dreamcast's finest. It's fun, exciting and the visuals are pretty interesting. There isn't a lot of lasting appeal, but it certainly is worth the experience.	1
this game is very fun!! very cool looking!!! I'm recommending this game to all Dreamcast owners, its a must have!!!	1
When I first bought this game after getting my Dreamcast, I thought it was decent. I really didn't like the time limit, I didn't like the fact that the "spray" button and the "center camera" button were both mapped to the same button, and I didn't like the mediocre frame rate. But I liked the graphic style, and the soundtrack was pretty cool.  After playing the Xbox-only sequel, Jet Set Radio Future, I realized that it had everything this game was missing. Why put the primary function that needs a clear view on the same button as the one that resets your view - especially when there's no manual camera control (a problem with many Dreamcast games)? Answer: Don't, especially when there's a whole other button (the right trigger) that isn't being used. JSRF fixed that problem easily.  Why have a time limit when your character both moves slowly, and is always being chased by police? Answer: Don't. Get rid of the time limit, speed up the character's movement, and restrict the police encounters to certain areas. JSRF fixed those problems easily.  I'll admit, the better graphics and frame rate are the result of moving to a higher-powered system instead. So I won't fault the game for not being on better hardware when said hardware didn't exist at the time.  It might seem like I'm just bashing this game for not being the second one, but...actually, that's exactly what I'm doing. Jet Set Radio Future is more fun, less frustrating, has better controls, and (since it was briefly the pack-in game for the Xbox) is going to be cheaper. Buy it, and leave this one as what it is: a rather uncomfortable stepping stone to a smooth rock that's aged far better.	-1
Came with everything, and no scratches. Looked like it was bran new. Really happy with the quality of my product.	1
I LOVE this game! I first played Jet Set Radio Future for Xbox, and I wanted more! So I got a Dreamcast off craigslist simply so I could play this game. It's wonderful!  I think I prefer the tagging method of JSRF. A few other things I'm not too fond of are the time limits, and how often you're shot at. It seems like you're always being shot at with bullets, missals, etc.  Overall, definitely worth it! I'm proud to own all the versions of Jet Grind/Set Radio available in the US (even for GameBoy Advance, but the depth perception for that kind of ruins it).	1
This was probably one of the greatest titles for the Dreamcast and probably one of the most memorable games made.  This is one of the first games that used cell shade style graphics that gave it a really unique look and added to how visually striking the game was.  The premise of the game was simple: you're a hooligan with roller blades trying to put your graffiti all over town.  It's been awhile but if I remember there were other groups trying to do the same and police would try to catch you...that's about all I remember.  If you're interested in this title it sounds like xbox live and PSN will probably have them available for download in the future.	1
This game, like the console it was released on went under the radar among gamers. For those of you who have played the game know it pushed the dreamcasts capabilities to the max and was a fun-filled game for anyone to enjoy.  Graphics: The developers of the game went with cell-shading which was probably the best thing they did for the game. The characters and the way the game was done jumped out at you.  Storyline: Actually pretty decent, you play as a member of the GG's fight the main villian, Gouji Rokakku (or something like that), who is bent on taking over Japan using other street gangs and the cops to take you out. You can choose between Tab, Beat or Gum in the beginning and unlock more characters as the story developes. After you beat the game and get jet ratings in side-stuff in the game you can play other events as a member of Poison Jam, Love Shockers, Noise Tanks and even your dog Potts.  Controls: Its easy, you pick up the controller and start moving around-that simple. Doing grafitti at first can be tricky but once you get it down its very simple and fun (something they unfortunately took out in the second game). Your character moves really slow but you can press a button to help sprint you along but doesn't last to long.  Levels: Levels are easy to navigate and all the grafitte and cell shading is candy to the eye. One thing my friend and I did would go around the areas looking to see if we could find rails and boards and stuff to do tricks on and make circles around parts of the level for maximum points.  Music: The music in this game is incredible and you'll eventually start singing along with it and not even know it. There are a few songs that will make you go nuts but its only one or two.  Overall this game is fun, easy to pick up and an overall joy to play. I can't think of anything bad the game really does. It gets an easy 5 out of 5 stars from this longtime fan.	1
Rating:A  While the Sega Dreamcast will always be known for its niche following of specific licenses, and projects that were well thought out but never received the commercial accolade they so deserved, it is by sifting through the grains of sand and finding specific games of this long gone system that we find a hugely underrated, and classic game in the wake of Jet Grind Radio. Featuring a cast of characters that never seems to get old and the continuous joy of tagging graffiti and running away from the police becomes increasingly more enjoyable as you collect graffit souls that open up newer and bigger tags. While I personally prefer the quicker pace of Future, don't let that fool you into tinking this game is not as enjoyable, it's just not as polished, and as quick paced. In this iteration, spray-painting is accomplished by doing motions on the controller similar to StreetFigthers fireball motions, etc. The music is as equally impressive as the visual style, which at the time of this games release was one of the original titles to featre cel-shading, a technique employed just recently to Capcom's Killer 7, with excellent results. Perhaps a game like this deserves to stay as an underground success, but it is unfortanate that we will probably never see a third game in this excellent series, after the lukewarm sales of JSRF. Oh well though, at least we've got the two games, but who knows maybe one day SmileBit will grace us with another excellent entry into this forgotten artistic masterpiece of a game.	1
Jet Grind Radio is not your average skating game and that's what I love about this game.  It's hip, it's new and fresh something that's has never bin done before.  Jet Grind is not only a terrific Dreamcast game but it simply one of the best Dreamcast games next to Shenmue and Soul Calibur.  The game is an instant classic that no one with a Dreamcast should miss out on.  The game is extreamly original and a very underrated gem, heck this is better then the Tony Hawk series.  It has a pretty cool story.  You're are the GG's a skate gang that pretty much takes over other groups of skaters turfs and to make matters worse you are being chased by a ruthless cop and his minions(AKA swat teams)and Tanks, Helicopters and so on.  This game unlike the sequal JET SET RADIO FUTURE is more challenging because it has a timer.  The games level desighn just keep getting better and better and the best part about this game is.....THE MUSIC.  This game has the best music next to Metal Gear Solid.  The music will really get you into this game which if really awesome.  The game is also pretty original cause you can spray grafiti on walls, trash cans, windows ect.  And no game has ever pulled this off but this game is Cell shaded and is very well done.  Every character and level is so well desighned that your mouth will be drooling in such amazment.  Put simply...the visuals in this game are amazing.  I'm going to make this short and sweet.

Overall Jet Grind Radio screams Originality and awesome....  Final Verdict..  This game truly deserves its  5 out of 5 stars  And I'm sticking to it......Jet Grind Radio is....AMAZING..  Lates	1
If you have been looking for a while for another good Dreamcast game to add to your collection, look no further. Jet Grind Radio is one of the best Dreamcast games ever. The first things you will notice about the game is its graphics. Sega made Jet Grind Radio the first cell-shaded game ever created. Another nice touch is the funky music they play while you're playing the game. The story behind this game is great. The city Tokyo-to is under control by four spray-painting gangs. The GG's (you're gang), Poison Jam, The Noise Tanks, and The Lover Shockers. Your goal is to wipe out Poison Jam, The Noise Tanks, and The Love Shockers. However, the police force in Tokyo-to has had it with all the graffiti all over the walls of the city, on buildings as well as on cars and buses. The police force is willing to do anything to capture you and your gang. The object of the game is simple, yet extremely fun. In each level you skate around, collect spray paint cans, find the red arrows and spray paint your tag. But you must be careful and pretty skilled to avoid the cops, tear gas, dogs, missle-launching helicopters, and even tanks. This makes the game much more challenging and will often leave you dead before being able to complete the mission. After you beat some of the levels you will often be challenged by rivals to show off your skills. Other times later in the game a few punks will want to join your gang, but for them to join you have to be them and copy what your gang's members do. This is definitely an awesome game with tons of replay value. If you never had a chance to pick this one up for your Dreamcast, you don't know what you're missing.	1
If you like good music, good fun, and a good challenge, it's hard to go wrong with Jet Grind Radio. It's fast paced, unique and very hard to put down. The first thing that will grab you is the style of the game. The graphics are very nicely cel shaded and the music will keep you jamming along nodding your head. The music isn't all golden, but for the most part, it's wonderful. The gameplay is rather simple but very fun. Skate around, find red arrows, spray paint your tag. All the while avoid cops, tear gas, dogs, even missile launching helicopters. It's hard and frustrating at times, but it's oh so worth it. You'll keep coming back for more and more. The game stands up to repeat plays, and the style never wears thin. The story is entertaining and well told by DJ K. Unlike so many games where the story between levels is the dull part, you'll be jamming along with DJ K all the way through. It's quite hard not to be brought into the Jet Set Radio universe. It's very well done. If you still have your Dreamcast around and you never gave this one a shot, try it. You may be quite surprised. - Rirath_com	1
First off, i have to say that I loved the music in this game. All types of music in different languages. Wow. Now the game was pretty fun. Lots of tricks to perform and a variety of levels to keep it interesting. My complaint is with the difficulty of the later levels. Good grief, some are near impossible. That however is minor and doesn't affect the game too much. Story: 4/10 Graphics: 9/10 Sound: 8/10 Fun: 7/10	1
This is a very addictive game.  If you like Tony Hawk Skater you would probobly like it.  It has its similarities.  However, I'm not a big fan of the Tony Hawk games and I loved it.  You get to skate around on futuristic rollar blades spay paint the town, gangs and run from the police.  Its not really set up to be vulgar like the Grand Theft Auto games which is a plus for younger players.  I would definitly recomed this to anyone.	1
I'll make this short and sweet. You skate around huge towns, Spraying and avoiding. The sound track kicks...... something for anybody(and if not, blare yours and turn off the others). Create and download all types of grafitti imaginable. It is also only 10 bucks. So go out and buy it, and one last thing.... JET SET RADIO!!	1
I'll make this review short. The graphics are increadable with cel-shaded models (for that cartoon look) and has 5 huge cities with little slowdown at all.  Fun to play, easy to beat (but I'm glad to go though it another 3 times), and has one of the best soundtracks this side of the planet.  At $(...), I see no reason why you shouldn't go to the local store and pick up a copy.  Don't buy this if you plan on doing your homework.	1
This is the first game that would make any aggressive skate pleased. Me myself am a aggressive skater and the amount of tricks in this game is pretty decent. The only problem I find with this game is that you cannot control what tricks your skater pulls. Another thing I dislike about this game is the sometime annoy gameplay where you might find your self stuck and unable to move. On the other hand, the cel shaded graphics are really nice and the soundtrack keeps you from wanting to kill the volume after 10 minutes. All in all, you should get this game if you like skating or something different from the traditional skating games.	1
Really worth much more than the price tag, this is a game that anyone will like.  The fairly juvenile premise did turn a lot of folks off when the game was first released (myself included) but I am very glad I looked past that and picked it up. Awesome gameplay, good cohesive storyline, fresh stylish animation, very inventive and compelling level design that shows how much the Dreamcast as a system is capable of.  Not to mention a fairly decent amount of playtime in order to beat it, no arcade 5-minutes-and-you're-done syndrome.  Cruise around a portion of the city, bumping off opponents & painting over their graffiti.  Eventually the cops show up, which you can usually deal with just be keeping active and running away.  But then the Chief shows up, and this dirtbag has a loaded gun!  I still get freaked out when I try to run away and the dude is firing live rounds in my general direction as he's chasing.  Yikes! All I can say is "Try it, you'll like it!"  It may not be the ultimate skating simulator, but it isn't meant to be.  There really are so few decent original action games for the Dreamcast and that makes Jet Grind Radio stand out that much more.  The game is pure fun, no matter what age you are.	1
Everything about Jet Grind Radio has classic written all over it.  The anime style graphics and some great original gameplay keep you entangled in the game for days.  Not much plot, but who cares, basically you play an angry teenager skating around spraypainting public property and outrunning and outmanuvering the cops while doing it.  After the first real mission, the game gets downright addicting and even more fun than before, something SEGA is great at doing with most of their in-house developed games.  The soundtrack is surprisingly decent too even though I'm not into hip-hop at all, tracks from Rob Zombie, Cold, and Professional Murder Music add to the replay value. The only problem with Jet Grind Radio is that there is no multi-player internet mode which would have made this the greatest game ever made, but thats only a minor gripe.  All in all an excellent game that any Dreamcast owner should have.	1
this game is lots of fun i mean whats better than going around town spray painting walls and cars and getting the cops and other people upset with you. One thing i found that i was very impressed with was the animation is beutifal to look at. One other thing i was afraid there was not gonna be enough characters but alas i was wrong there are plenty of characters you can use to help spraypaint town.	1
To tell you the truth, I didn't like the Tony Hawk games very much.  In fact after about an hour of that game I was ready to throw my Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, or Playstation across the room if I had to play any more of it!!!  It wasn't that it was a bad game.  It just had NO point to it WHAT SO EVER!!!!  And that is why I didn't pre-order Jet Grind Radio right away.  I thought right away that this would be the same this as Tony Hawk!  Boy was I wrong!  While Tony Hawk was about nothing but performing tricks, Jet Grind Radio is a game that takes place in the future! Where the government has too much controll, and teenagers now have only one way to express themselves!  No it's not music.  It's graffity.  You have to spray-paint your logo everywhere you go, while avoiding the cops, F.B.I, Air Force, assasins, and watch dogs!!!  Sound fun yet?  There's more.  You can also creat your own logo's, get a bunch of new charicters to play around with, and perform tricks just by pressing the A-Button!!! While Tony Hawk gets old very quickly Jet Grind Radio keeps you intrested till the end!  [...] You can't go wrong!	1
When I first heard about Jet Set Radio in a magazine I was reading, I thought that it was totally whack and stupid.  It's actually pretty kool. There are tons of pros to this game, and they definitely outweigh the cons.  You get to go around and deface property by tagging it, and that in itself is a lot of fun.  You can unlock new gangs, and even a dog to skate with.  You can also do tricks and stuff like that, which earn you points.  The controls are okay, bu there are 3 buttons that you don't use, so if you have a turbo controller, don't bother using it. Of course, all games have cons, and the main thing I don't like is the fact that the police chase you, and you can only run away.  Also, if you're tagging some stuff, it may take long enough for that annoying police squadron to find you and shoot you.  If there was maybe an afterburner or something that would delay the police for a few seconds, that would be good. Overall, this is a very good game, and I enjoy playing it.	1
This game is the best. It's like tony hawk with graffitti. you do tricks and grind up and down rails. you have to collect cans to do all the graffitti in the levels. there are 3 different cities and 4 differnt gangs going against you. plus a bunch of differnt characters	1
It seems like such a silly premise to me.  You play a character that roller-blades around various locales spray-painting graffiti on things and running from the keystone cops when they spot you.  Nevertheless, this game is a lot of fun. The graphics for this game are actually quite simple, but the cel-shading effect makes them a breath of fresh air in a time when most 3D games look the same.  Everything appears like it's happening in a comic book, but has the depth and detail that you expect from a 3D game.  In addition to that, the sound is really good if you enjoy this kind of music.  Not everyone does and since only one track plays on any given level, you run the chance of hearing it... a lot.  My cousins would play the tutorial for hours... and just one track would play the entire time. It's exciting to play the game, though.  There's plenty to do and discover, but it's not a daunting task to do so.  Tricks happen almost automatically just from jumping in the air.  Things like grinds, flips, and spins require no series of controller manipulation and button smashing to accomplish.  And secrets are found by skill and accident in equal parts in my personal experience. There are some quirks to get used to or simply deal with regarding the controls, but it doesn't do enough damage to detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.  It's just another great game from Sega.	1
Jet Grind Radio is a really unique game. There has never been a game like this (as far as I know). The graphics are amazing. It goes perfect with the game and it's cool looking. You gotta see it to belive it. The gameplay is good and packs a lot of fun but the main problem is the sloppy control. Half the time you will be screwing up because of those ... controls. The sound is very good. There are so many songs in the game and the sound effects are sweet. But the cops get annoying though. Overall, this game was great and it's worth experiencing at least once. I recommend renting this first and making your decision on buying it or not. Graphics: 10/10 Gameplay: 8/10 Control: 7/10 Sound: 10/10 Replay Value: 5/10 (gets boring fast) Frustration: High  Fun Factor: 10/10	1
Jet Grind Radio is the kind of game you can just play forever (or at least it seems.) For those who "get" the premise, they'll find endless interest in trying to perfect their grinds, find more runs, more tricks, and just see how far you can push your ideas and the game. Jet Grind Radio is the kind of game that rewards those who like to really spend time with their games. If you're a more casual gamer, you may be disappointed that working through the game, seeing every level, is not that hard nor takes that long.	1
Jet Grind Radio is yet another impressively creative title to come out of Sega (which is why I'm so fond of Sega), and definitely rates as a success. The concept is simple, you skate around towns, tagging (spraypainting) certain objects while evading police officers, police dogs, rockets from helicopters, and other baddies. The animation style is really what cements the experience as being something out of the ordinary, though. Dubbed "cel-shading", the end result is something that looks very much like a cartoon. It's really beautiful to watch as well as play. The gameplay is fun, but has some problems. The first, which likely everyone has addressed, is camera control. There are 3 unused buttons on the controller, and the developers still decided for some unknown reason to double up controls. It's annoying, but you learn to live with it. The other issue that bugs me is that you're constantly on the run from police with no real defense other than fleeing. One other problem I have is with the menu system. When you boot up, you're given the choice of starting a new game, playing a tutorial, or loading an existing file. However, once you have a game in play (through creating a new game or loading), you have to reboot the system to load another. This is really a patently ridiculous feature and particularly annoying if you like alternating w/ a friend but keep seperate game files. One other note I should make is that the worlds may seem smaller than they were described by other reviewers at first. I was pretty aggravated and disappointed for a while until I got far enough that I was actually given the opportunity to skate more or less freely without worry of harassment by police, etc.. It's a bit into the game, but worth noting if you get discouraged. All in all, Jet Grind Radio is still a fantastic game, and definitely a game to get for the Dreamcast. There are minor points that really should have been taken care of, but other than that, a solid effort.	1
...but not without its faults. Jet Grind Radio is getting comparisons to both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Crazy Taxi--and it's obvious as to why. The jumping and grinding the rails, the tricks, and the skating vibe has more than its share of Tony Hawk in it. The arrows that direct you, the nonstop action, and the way it plays is very much like Crazy Taxi. So is Jet Grind Radio basically those two games put together? No! Definitely not. The characters and the graphics are superior to those two games put together, and the tagging element is original. My biggest complaint is the control--it's pretty lame. The A button is to jump, the R button is to accelerate, and the L button is used to both guide the camera and tag. The three left over buttons aren't used. Duh, Sega! It's so frustrating using the L button when trying to tag the bosses (I'll get to this later) and instead it refocuses your camera. There's no brake button either, which isn't too important, but would have been nice. What also bothered me was the lack of a two player option. WHY would Sega not put that option in here? Jet Grind Radio could've been one of my all-time favorite games had there been the option of two players. Ah, yes...my nemesis that plagues video games everywhere--the camera. It's bad enough that there's a cheap camera/tag button, but the camera has a way of screwing up like they always do. But what about the good points, you say? There's plenty of those, let me tell you... While I usually shy away from starting my praises with the graphics (they're not as important as gameplay, ya know), I can't really help it here. The graphics in Jet Grind Radio are simply astonishing. The cel-shaded world of Jet Grind Radio is unbelievable. Just watching this game looks like you're watching a cartoon--actually, that would be an insult the game. Jet Grind Radio looks better than the cartoons US companies put out (not on par with anime, but we can't have it all, I suppose). It makes Disney look like crayon books in motion. Unbelievable, I tell you, unbelievable. Next would be the gameplay. Addicting comes to mind, so does amazing. But the word that describes Jet Grind Radio best is FUN. I haven't had this much single player fun for my Dreamcast since, well... when was the last time I had this much fun? Yes, this is more addicting than Shenmue, and I think it belongs up there in ranks with it. I can't tell you how much fun it is grinding down a rail at top speed, leaping through the air like a superhero, and then tagging the wall. Sweet. The music to Jet Grind Radio is more quirky hip-hop than anything, and it easily fits the game (and, yes, I like it). There's some cuts from real artists such as Rob Zombie (why did they label him industrial though? Duh!), Jurassic 5, Mix Master Mike, Cold, and more. Some are complaining about this since (most of) the J-pop is gone from the import--I say good riddance, as I hate J-pop. But the music in this game is catchy (and even though I am a Rob Zombie fan, it still seems odd putting him in this game. Still a good [remixed] song though), and I enjoyed it very much. The characters are great, too. My personal favorite was Cube, of course (us Goths are neglected in games, so it's nice to see one in here--plus she's cute, heh). She has become one of my favorite video game characters of all time--she's cool, she's hip, and, well, she's a Goth. But I loved ALL the characters in this game, they all have an irresistable charm to them, and even the bad guys were great (Love Shockers!). One has to wonder why Beat is the main character though (I love the guy, but him over, say, Cube or Combo? Please). I would have prefered having Cube and Combo (you gotta love the fact that Combo skates with a boombox kicking out "phat jams") didn't come out so late in the game though--as they were my two favorite characters--but that's alright, I suppose. Like they should, the characters all have different statistics. One may be better at tagging, one might be faster, while the other might have a bigger life bar; so experimenting with the different characters is key here. Speaking of life bar, something that Tony Hawk or Crazy Taxi didn't have was enemies. At times this can get annoying seeing as how your only real defense is to flea, but they add a challenge to the game. There are all sorts of enemies that chase you--from tanks, to helicopters, to losers running up and tackling you, there's a fair amount of baddies to avoid. Te bosses can get annoying though, as you have to tag three of them onthe back--and like everything else you do, you're on a timer. They always knock you down and take off, this gets frustrating when you need one more tag and they knock you down and you die. The length of the game isn't very long, actually, but for some reason this didn't bother me, as I keep going back to it for more. All in all, Jet Grind Radio is one of the best games for the Dreamcast yet. It has a decent challenge, great characters, great dialogue, the option of creating your own graffiti, and it leaves you with a strong addiction due to its infectious, semi-original gameplay (and hey, there's even some more levels than the Japanese version...although I wish they stuck with the original name, Jet Set Radio). A must own masterpiece that deserves to be in EVERY Dreamcast owners' library. I cannot wait for Jet Grind Radio 2--Sega just better leave Cube in though if they know what's good for 'em.	1
Rather than re-hashing a genre that was old 5 years ago, SEGA has created something entirely new and fresh, and they have succeded. They took a risk and pulled it off. In Jet Grind you are a hoodlum/skater/dancer type who rollerblades around in beutifully animated environmentsm spray painting everything from police chiefs to playground signs. You can also create your own graffiti(nothing to ellaborate, but still cool)and that adds to the replay valua. The characters are so beutifully animated in fact you'll spend at least 30 minutes of play time just staring at Tab or Beat wondering how they could make it look so good. This game isn't good for any one real reason, it's just so totally funny , crazy, and original that you have to love it. Check it out.	1
This game is all based around the element of fun.  The game cannot be taken seriously.  This game seems to be a cross between tony hawks and crazy taxi, which i think is a good thing as i have like both of those games.  This game has a high novelty factor at first but it soons wears out as does your tolerance towards the gaming controls.  Overall its worth buying if you just wanna have a bit of fun.	1
It's not perfect.  The controls could use some work, and some of the levels are overly difficult. But you can't help but laugh and smile while playing the game.  It has a Parappa the Rapper quality.  The gameplay isn't perfect, but the fun factor is absolutely over the top.  Some of the Japanese tunes are a little quirky, but the majority are hip with deep beats that get even the most jaded gamer (and sister who hates video games) to tap their foot in unison. Buy it.  It's original.  It's fun.	1
Everything was done right with this game.  It's an amusing, interesting, unique game concept.  The graphics use an outline technique that makes a 3-d world of 2-d characters, to produce an effect something like "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?".  I generally can't take video game music, and I used to live in Japan and hated J-pop even more, but the soundtrack for this game is great, has some genuinely cool tunes.  Gameplay is smooth and fun, and baddies have an over-the-topness to them that matchs the cartoon atmosphere. There's unfortunately minor difficulties with slowdown and camera angles.  Aside from these problems, this is a game like Pac-Man, a really unique idea that's executed so well there's nothing that could be improved upon.  I think this is the best game for the Dreamcast (or any other system!) and strongly recommend it.	1
While this game may not teach a great moral lesson (graphiti is fun!), it's still a blast to play. It's got a whole lot of style and you can tell that it's straight out of Japan. I love the music too; it's strange, but in a good way. I just wish it was longer.	1

This game has such style and character that you haven't seen since the dawn of the original Nintendo.  This is the most hip and fresh game that I have ever laid my eyes upon.  Granted, Rob Zombie is not the best representative of "hip", but trust me...everything else is.  The animation is simply amazing.  Outlined 3D polygons on top of motion-captured characters...hugely detailed sets with an impressionistic style.  One little glitch is that the viewing distance is not as long as you would like it to be...items can be just out of view, even if you can see the background just underneath it.  And the camera angles can be a bit of a nuisance as I read in a preview long ago.  If you get stuck in a corner, you can't really use the re-center tool effectively. But make no mistake, the music and visuals leave an indelible impression on your mind that you will remember for a long time.  The soundtrack includes the aforementioned Zombie, Jurassic 5, Mixmaster Mike and many many more tracks.  And after the initial storyline, you can skate around the vast locations and race the CPU, make your own tags, etc.  One thing I would love to see is a two or more player mode where you challenge each other to tags, or races.  It'd be fun to even just skate around with your friends online and tag each other.  Capture the flag, the possibilities are endless with the broadband adaptor.  Till then, here's to the most original game in recent years.  Great job Smilebit.	1
The controls are crisp the speed is good and the graphics rock.  Compter AI is also good.  Deffinately worth a few dollars.	1
Picking up where the first left off once again we join the fight.  I haven't gotten very far in this game but I can see that it is pretty much like the first.  Decent graphics and humor surround you and a nice plot line is unfolding.  Definately worth the bargain price.	1
Welcome to 18th century England where Lord Palethorn has found part of an ancient book of sorcery (which should look kinda familiar) and basically manages to repopulate the world with zombies and other critters as he does the "go off and rule the world" thing. Sir Dan wakes up in a museum with only his own detachable arm as a weapon (to start off with, he finds a sword PDQ) and goes off to fight evil, finding some interesting characters, weapons and puzzles along the way! This game has some cool elements, like being to pop your head off, stick it on a crawling hand, and basically run around like "Thing" from the Adam's Family. It also has a neat storyline and, of course, hacking and slashing is always a blast... The play control needed a little help, however. The camera angles kinda drive you nuts, and life is hard to come by! Some of the bosses are a little hard to kill, and when you go to the next level, your little, battered life-meter is really frustrating as you get wasted by EVERYTHING. Sometimes it's best to make sure you save between levels... them beat the level your on again with fewer accidents. Also, if you make too many misjumps (which is easy to do), every one costs you an entire bar of life... the green smoke only provides about 200 points of recovery... then it goes bye-bye. If you make a lot of mistakes in a certain area, you'll pay for it later! Cool game, had a lot of fun with it, looking forward to Midieval III should they decide to make one(Sir Dan in the future with a light-saber or something might be kinda cool!), I just hope they make the camera angles friendlier!	1
Graphics: 7/10 - A bit unclear in places but you can definitely see how much effort when into making these creatures look fabulous and making the towns look realistic. Sound: 9/10 - The best thing about this game! The sound is thunderous and fabulous, it literally takes you into the times of MediEvil! Value: 7/10 - You won't play this game much if you not really willing to be very strategic, but it's definitely worth the money for a few weeks entertainment. Overall: 7/10 - MediEvil 2 is intelligent, entertaining and is put together nicely, it's very worth playing but only if you have the time to solve all the complex problems.	1
A few of the levels in this game aren't medievil,such as the gardens,the observatory,the academy,and the museum. But some such as the tomb,hall,sewer,cathedral are. Perhaps that's the only problem. You can play as DanHand,half head,half hand to get into small passages too. You also go boxing,when Sir Dan's friend,The Professer puts it on a Frankenstein-like body. You can even play without Sir Dan's skull on. And in the tomb you have to solve a puzzle of rescuing the Egyptian princess,Kiya. The main plot is that your favorite skeleton knight is awakened by a mad wizard named Palethorn,with the pages of Zarok,(remember that big chinned dress wearing madman who trapped the mayor,awakened the dead zombies,and tried his best to kill Sir Dan?) So Dan is awakened to attack the awakened dead. This game may be challenging though. And also you know,I suggest you buy the strategy guide. Get this game,it's fun.	1
1998 saw the release of Medievil on the Playstation. It was a fantastic game and top of the platform genre, rivalled only by Crash Bandicoot and possibly Wild 9. It was set in Medievil times, obviously, and, although a bit easy, was value for money as it is an enjoyable game from start to finish. The only glitches are the already mentioned lifespan of the game and a few camera angles. Fast-forward two years and the sequel is somewhat dissapointing. Gone are the atmospheric, 'MEDIEVIL' levels such as 'The Sleeping Village', 'The Pirate Ship', the time zone one and the one in the castle. Instead we have a museum, an observitory and Kew Gardens. These levels were nowhere near as good as the ones in the previous game, for they had a lot more atmosphere and had a more Medievil style about them. There were still a few glimpses of the levels from the first game, Kensington (The Sleeping Village perhaps?), Cathedral Spires and Wulfrum Hall are the highlights of the game. Apart from the above, there are no major differences. The camera angles are just as good, but can be just as bad. The control of the character is exactly the same and there is little change in the graphics. The major letdown is the length. After the challenge of the first game, this was even easier to complete. If you have the choice of buying a top class platformer then I strongly recomend Medievil 1 or Crash 3 though these can be a little easy. If your looking for a challenging platformer then buy Wild 9. I know I've slated the game quite badly in this review, but it is still a lot better than some games I've played. A 'b-grade' platformer verging on the edge of 'A'. A few more levels and this is one of the best games ever but after the superb original, this is a little dissapointing.	1
Dirty disc	-1
just like the first one you can complete it within hours	1
Awesome game, my son loves this game and so do e all in the house. It is fun, and it was shipped early and in perfect condition.	1
Happy that i order the game now i can play it again. So worth getting it and very happy with the product and would order this item again	1
At first I was having an excrutiatingly, PAINFULLY difficult time with the game... until I discovered a special input code that made my experience the BEST GAME EVER!  I thank you Amazon.com for your birthday contribution.  Furthermore, I solute you!	1
This rumble pak is a very neat idea to add to the games. Bad thing is it only works on some games. Check the red bar on the right of the package for the games to see if it says rumble pak. Good thing if it does because it is very fun when it vibrates like when you get tackled in NFL blitz or wrestled in WWF no mercy. It will be tons of fun. ENJOY!!!	1
Hey People! Rumble Paks says it all. You put it into your controller then BAM! It rocks! When you play a game with great sound effects, you feel your controller rumbling like you're actually in the game! I used this mostly on Golden Eye and Star Fox 64. Its great I tell you. The only thing is that you need 2 AAA batteries.	1
This is only a rumble if you are under 8 years old, otherwise it's ...tremble that is not worth the money or the AA batteries that you need for it. The Rumble Pack fits into the slot of your N64 controller, and then a save pack fits into the Rumble Pack, making the controller quite heavy! There are two settings for the pack, low and high. Another annoying part of the pack is that there are two modes, one to turn the Rumble Pack on, and the other to work your gamepack to save games. Its just a hassle, and the only games that really use it are Zelda when you are fishing and sporting games, so you can feel the action.	-1
this is a good product especially games with a lot of explosions and loud vibrations where u acctually feel a sample of the vibration like in first person shooter games where u feel like the forceback of the gunshot which is pretty cool exept the only thing i have to complain is there should be more of a vibration then i would have got 1 for all my controllers hopefully gamecubes built in analog in the controller will be better and it will save money too	1
The N64 Rumble Pak is a great accessory when you are able to use it. What I mean is that not all games work with the Rumble Pak. Otherwise when it is working with a game that it works with, the result is amazing. You can practicaly feel what is going on and what the character physically feels. Buy this but be aware of games it works and doesn't work with. HAPPY GAMING!	1
This really enhaces your gaming experience.  It shakes when you get hit in certain games.  I recomend everyone get one.	1
Rumble Pak arrived on time, but it was filthy dirty and broken. The housing is cracked and will not allow it to plug in to the controller. It's not worth sending back. Beware that it was listed as very good condition.	-1
worked well	1
Name brand rumble Pak works perfectly as expected. You can even mod it to run without batteries.	1
Great!	1
no issues with any of the four i bought	1
Dudd	-1
works great	1
It is a good product.	1
Son love this	1
Rumble on the effect is what I'm talking about Get rechargeable battery's for it tho that will save u in the long run	1
It rumbles! A must have for any n64 game.	1
excellent condition	1
great	1
works wonderful.	1
doesn't work at all	-1
Got it new works great, but no memory inside uses 2 AAA batteries. Adds more weight  to the controller.	1
IF you don't have to save and what that everyday rumble feel of todays games, then this is a must buy.	1
Remember the good times.	1
Great product What else can I say? This is a great purchase, this is more than awesome. I Truly recomend it!	1
I will never buy from this seller EVER again. The rumble pak don't work, plus the idiot didn't take out the batteries. I think I'll go on ebay and buy another USED Rumble pak that works GREAT!	-1
The Nintendo 64 is a classic console with some of the best games of all time. I find that a rumble pack clicked into your controller enhances the gaming experience tenfold! I bought a few of the official Nintendo 64 rumble pacs and everyone loves them. They make the controller vibrate and react to games like modern controllers do! They are well worth the purchase if your gamer and want that full immersive gaming session!	1
This is an absolute necessity for an N64 controller, because of it we can now play a multitude of games that we have for the system.	1
This rumble pak is cool to have on your game system.  Because when you get in danger you get to feel the rumble pak buzz in your hand and it makes the game more interesting to me.	1
Great purchase. One needs this to get the most out of the game. Great purchase for the Nintendo 64 to know when you have been hit.	1
There was nothing about this product that wasn't as advertised. It plugged right in, had the battery cover, and worked like a charm.	1
I'm going to whine for minute that Nintendo's rumble pack should not have had to use batteries.... Boo! But on the other hand it works great! Thank you!	1
Works great! Needed for a lot of N64 games. Just plugs right in and stays there, don't ever need to remove.	1
not pretty much to say but the truth, stay close to branded products stay away for third parties when it comes to items like these!!!! this specific gimmick for your controller is the only one that actually is strong enough and soft enough the quality end frequency of the servo is amazing almost as good as a dualshock 3, if planning to buy a rumble pak GET THE NINTENDO LICENSED ONE!!!!	1
i bought this so i could smash things in zelda with the hammer and throw rocks haha not much else to say, it is what it is	1
the rumble pack for the N64 fits nicely into the N64 controller and looks well, you need to AAA batteries to use it. works just fine	1
Let me start off by saying I'm a big fan of the Nintendo 64 system and it's controller. The rumble pack accesory sticks into the N64 controller and when you play the video games that have the rumble feature the pack makes you feel like you're part of the game and the action. I think the rumble feature became a standard in the game systems that came after it such as the Nintendo Game Cube and Microsoft X Box. I think the rumble pack has so much rumble to it that you not only feel it but you actually hear it. It gives another great sound to make an even better audio experience. The games that work with the rumble pack are even more fun when you use it. Some examples are the original Super Smash Bros,F Zero X,Kirby 64 The Crystal Shards and the epic Zelda game Ocarina Of Time. This rumble pack accessory takes 2 AAA batteries and the battery life for this accesory seems to be quite long so you won't be disappointed.	1
The nintendo64 rumble pak,has a much stronger rumble than i thought it would have! I am a 1st time owner of this rumble pak. I honestly did not think it'd vibrate as strong as it does! I expected a slight movement when it rumbled. was I shocked! This is true name brand'nintendo' not generic brand.maybe thats why? you'll love this feature while playing your game,great investment,which you'll never regret! :) This isn't just for kids,it's also for us mature big kids hee~hee~hee.....	1
Ah, I remember the day when I walked into Wal-Mart, saw Starfox 64 playing on the kiosk, and eagerly grabbed the controller... and to my astonishment, my hands were shaking with every explosion! I couldn't believe how much a simple battery operated shaking device could immerse me in the game, and it instantly ended up on my Christmas list along with Starfox 64 (which the the pak originally came bundled with, BTW).  Nowadays, the novelty of rumble has largely worn off, but it still remains an important part of gameplay in many genres. The shooter genre was somewhat revolutionized when gamers were able to sense every time a bullet hit them, and take cover accordingly without even needing to look at their health bar. Racing games let gamers feel the rumble of the rough off-road terrain every time they took a wrong turn... Rumble had existed before the rumble pak, but it was the rumble pak that brought this nifty technology to the console front, and made it a standard for every controller from that day forward.	1
the cheap thing that the nintendo 64 didn't have was a rumple feature. But with this rumble pak, the vibration u get from it really depends on what game u r playing. Like in goldeneye 007, the more automatic weapons u get, the heavier the vibration is.  if u want the best vibration, i suggest get this pak and also buy Star Fox 64, Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, and racing games.	1
The rumble pack was one of the greatest inventions to come out in the video game era. Now with the more updated systems the rumble function is built into the controller. That is not so with the N64. The Rumble Pack was introduced along side Starfox 64. When you get shot, hit someone, get hit, explosions, and many other actions will cause your controller to shake. It makes game playing a lot more fun. It's great in a football game where your sizing a guy up for a hit, you do it and then you feel the rumble. The controller will shake more if it's a harder impact. Lots of fun. There are some cons. You have to use batteries and you have to take it out to put your memory pack in. To me the cons don't come close to the pros and fun of the controller. If you have an N64 you must own a Rumble Pack. You won't regret it.	1
Im glad i got this. It really makes me feel like im in the game. Its also small and fits perfect into the controler pak, and its excellent for any games, though please note that some games won't allow it, but any way, worth buying.	1
I got the N64 for Christmas by a nice worker at a Chinese restaurant in 1999.  When I first tried it I was amazed.  I never saw 3-D graphics since I upgraded from the SNES.  Then I heard of the Rumble Pack, but I purchased a 3rd party one from Interact since it was cheaper, but it was big, heavy, and required 2 double A batteries.  Not to mention, the rumble quality was poor.  Then I threw it out and got myself a Naki Rocker Pack w/a built in memory card plus(this pack is battery free).  I was really happy with it for a year until I tried the official Rumble Pack. At that very day, I noticed a difference (the Rocker Pack's rumble was weaker than the official one).  I decided that it was time to put in some extra cash to get the real Rumble Pcak from the trustworthy Nintendo.  The only problem was that it required 2 triple A battries, but at least the performance is top notch.	1
Good product if your favorite games support it. The PS1 rumble feature is better implemented, though.	1
The Nintendo 64 Rumble Pak is a great addition to use while you play your video games. Too bad the Rumble Pak only works on certain games which are indicated on the game's box. But if you play a game compatible with the Rumble Pak, it's awesome. It vibrates if you get tackled in NFL Blitz, get wrestled in WWF No Mercy, or shot or hit in other games. You'll have a lot of fun with the Rumble Pak with your N64 games.	1
The Sega VMU is simply amazing. It is not just a memory card, but it also shows the last time you used your game, a clock and games that you can download of Sega Net. It also has a great LCD screen which you can use to choose your plays in football games so your friends don't cheat. The only problem is the battery power is weak and it the VMU only holds 200 blocks which is just enough to save one Sega Sports 2K2. The Sega VMU is still a great deal ...	1
Great buy	1
I love this classic so much	1
At the time this game originally released I was a young teenager.  I was hungry for videogames and had all the time in the world.  At this time, I played and beat The Legend of Dragoon.  I loved it.  Since those days I've often thought fondly of this game.  Now in recent days, I've completed the game for a second time, putting in nearly 50 hours.  What I've realized is that this game belongs in the past and I want to warn anyone considering picking up this game.  If this game is ever remade I'll be in line for it.  Until then I suggest we leave it in the past.  Story 9/10 The greatness of the story is timeless.  Truly someone took put a lot of effort into writing this story.  There are a lot of great twist and the character development is wonderful.  You'll start to connect the with characters in no time.  Visuals 4/10 For the time these visuals were top notch. By today's standards these graphics are lacking.  This is to be expected.  Sound 4/10 The soundtrack is perfect.  I could listen to the menu them all day.  The music in this game blows me away every time I listen to it.  I didn't really notice anything wrong with the sound effects.  The voice acting in this game is really bad and often goofy.  Not to mention occasionally during cut scenes I couldn't make out what the characters were saying.  There are no subtitles available during some scenes.  Very disappointing.  Mechanics/Gameplay 2/10 Normal movement in the game is occasionally hinder by invisible catches which is slightly annoying.  The battle system is somewhat lacking and get old really fast.  You are required to do timed button pushes for your normal attacks.  It's fun for a few minutes but not 50 hours.  My biggest complaint is that you cannot skip certain battle scenes.  Every time you cast your dragoon magic you have to watch a short scene.  I'm pretty sure I could have cut my playtime down by a FEW HOURS if I didn't have to watch these things every time.  The final boss also has a lot of scenes.  Heaven forbid that you should die halfway through that fight.  Basically my play through this game as an adult netted me nothing but some nostalgic enjoyment and watching a great story unfold again.  The gameplay itself was little to no fun.  Almost like a chore.  So now I warn you, leave this in the past.	-1
Works for me, great for the $ and is new !!	1
When I first saw this on Amazon I was quite surprised. I figure at this stage Sega would have off loaded their design to some third party knock off provider who would have jacked the price up due to it being a "retro" piece in gaming history.  To my surprise I was completely wrong. This is still officially licensed and manufactured by SEGA. The price for the VMUs are fantastic and the selection in colors is awesome.  If you do find some third party making these - forget them. Go straight to the creator and support the SEGA Dreamcast legacy.	1
Awesome classic enough said.	1
pro -good story - good characters - innovative combact system -good 2d graphics  cons -3d graphics are so-so - lame music -simple gameplay	1
thank u	1
works great	1
Works	1
It is such a great memory to see this again, just a reminder of how long memory cards have came. It works too.	1
VERY good condition and runs perfectly! One of the good memories of my childhood.	1
This game is a epic 4 disc and should take you at least 40 hours to beat.  It definitely doesn't hold your hand though so I do recommend finding a guide online especially if you want to get all the stardust (you'll need these to get special items).  It is backwards compatible with PS2 and PS3, yet it is still region locked.  I really enjoyed the story, cinematics, and lore.  It would be nice to get a prequel/sequel.  But what really made this game unique is the dragoon transformations in the middle of battle, which can be very fun, and additions added something fresh to turned based JRPG.  With additions you basically have to time every attack you do.  Other than that, it is definitely a old classic worth playing and has aged very well.  Go get the physical version, so if you don't like it.  At that point you can decide to sell it, with physical you are SOL.	1
Truly an amazing game. I wish there were more rpgs like the in today's modern gaming world.	1
I cannot tell you how happy I was too have gotten this game again to play it. So many memories. Could have gotten here a little faster though...Twas probably my impatience. Oh well, thank you!	1
This is the greatest psx game ever made lol. I've gone through like 4 copies of this game cause I play it so much	1
The inside of the case came broken and will not hold disc 3 in place. Regardless, the game discs and manuals are in good condition.	1
It's one of my favorite team fighting rpg games I've played. I really wish they had made more legend of dragoon games. But hopefully they bring it back in the future some time.. I've never hard anyone dislike this game that played it. So if you a big rpg fan that likes the final fantasy like games then you hit the jackpot playing this game. First you start out playing as a regular character upgrading weapons and armor and what not. But then after So far in the beginning of the game you'll find a dragoon power, giving you magical armor with wings, also giving yourself extra combo attacks with magical super attacks.  You will later find companions down the road which you'll find dragoon powers for them also.  Your attackers will be set off every 30-60 steps you take outta the town area's. They'll be a light indicator on the top of your guy's head showing how close you are to the next attackers set off battle. Every time you go into battle you'll gain experience points, items and gold, which will help you buy stuff, sell stuff in towns, and make your guy upgrade in his or hers levels.  The game itself is 4 CD disks. It's a good long length game, but a lot of the CD space I figure is full its detail in beauty and artwork which is way worth it. If I bought this game today i'd still pay $40-$50 dollars for it. This I believe is a well worth and needed game for the PlayStation, ahead of it's time.	1
It is great. It allows me to save video game data I played so hard for on the classic Dreamcast.	1
A very good option to store data for your sega dreamcast when getting a memory unit always try to get the one with the small screen and make sure its the original official from sega, this ones are named VMU this kind is better because some Dremcast games have mini games to unlock more stuff, you must win these minigmes, also try to get them brand new if possible with the cap and a transparent finish, they look cool.	1
The Sega VMU is simply amazing. It is not just a memory card, but it also shows the last time you used your game, a clock and games that you can download of Sega Net. It also has a great LCD screen which you can use to choose your plays in football games so your friends don't cheat. The only problem is the battery power is weak and it the VMU only holds 200 blocks which is just enough to save one Sega Sports 2K2. The Sega VMU is still a great deal for less than [money].	1
A classic, through and through, and yet probably isn't that well known. Sony gave us a great RPG here, and I don't think anyone saw it coming. Everything about this game emanates style. Great, unique gameplay, awesome story, and it's very different feel make this a truly great game.	1
Good game and rival to early PlayStation final fantasy games. A good reminder as how RPGs used to be.	1
Great game.	1
kids love it	1
one of my all time favorite buy it you will have lots of fun	1
Loved the battle system and the story.  It really is a great game.	1
Awesome game that really takes you back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
best rpg i have ever played	1
I played it on my PS2 and got to the 2nd disc after some lagging in the 1st disc. The 1st cut scene did not play but showed a later one on repeat. 4 days later while paying it on my PS3(minus the lagging gameplay on disc 1),the CGI scene played BUT JUMPED 4 times!!! It paused after the 1st jump. Plus,the 2nd disc refused to start up during the 2nd playthrough. I wonder if I can make it to disc 3,let alone the 4th one!!	-1
looks and is in really great condition, works really great, never a problem do I have when I play this game, thank you very much for this game!	1
i am a big fan of this item was so glad to get it, and it was everything i hoped it would be	1
so i bought a copy of this game and its condition was ok according to amazon. when it arived i was more than impressed with the condition of the game it was almost like new condition only thing was the case was a little damaged but the discs look amazing!	1
I HAVE GOT THE LEGEND OF DRAGOON GAME AND CASE WAS IN GREAT SHAPE SO WAS THE CD WAS IN GOOD SHAPE	1
Very under rated game.  They need to make a sequel for the newer systems.  The only problem I have with this game is the travel system wasn't as open as you would want and more straight forward.	1
only bad thing was the on several of the disc holders the center pieces were broken so the game discs don't stay in place.	1
It seems like the classic games will always have a place on my shelf. I do think this game is good but have never beaten it yet	1
loved it but if ppl want to write a book then thats on them but we shouldnt have to put this much on feed back	1
This is one of those games that gets mixed reviews from critics but great reviews from users. Where to begin? First let me say that I'm not an idiot who carelessly gives out perfect scores. But this game is just so good, it deserves it.  Combat: This is a turn-based game with an innovative combat system. You can have 3 members in your party. When it's your turn, you attack, defend, use items, or transform into Dragoons (more on this later). The attack system is really the innovative part. You time input of the X button as rotating squares align with the center square on screen. If the timing isn't perfect, your combo stops. You keep up the perfect timing until your combo is finished. With every 20 perfect combo you pull off-called "additions"-your addition gets stronger. The perfect timing sounds hard, but it's really not. It just takes a little practice, and seeing your addition play out on screen is always fun. There are anywhere from 3 to 7 additions for each character, and you switch out additions whenever you feel like it. There's plenty to master here with the number of playable characters. You later gain the ability to transform into a Dragoon, a flying warrior capable of performing magical attacks. In this state your attack and defense power increase, and you can level up your Dragoon Level in addition to regular level. You have a threat indicator above you that shows when you'll engage in battle. It increases in threat level as you move around and the screen fades to battle. Some might find this annoying, but I liked having the chance to get stronger.  Format: You play from a sort of backed-away view. It's third person, but not zoomed in like with Uncharted or Dead Space. You travel from area to area via the world map. Once you know what your objective is, you just go to the right area and go from there.  Environments: You'll encounter everything under the sun: from underwater settings to expansive deserts. And every place is extremely diverse with its own interactions. In a dragon's lair, you'll climb spiderweb-like strings. On a snowy mountain, you'll slide down slopes. In the desert, you'll get sucked into sand-whirlpools. Then there's of course the cities to visit. Each city has its own feel; you can enter shops, houses, castles, hotels-you name it. The developers were really imaginative with everything.  Graphics: Outdated by today's standards, but impressive for its time. You can still make out figures, so it's not too bad. Personally, though, I don't play games for their graphics.  Story: Very well written. It starts off as a simple rescue-the-damsel-in-distress but evolves into so much more, and I really can't give away too much plot detail. Just know that there are a couple plot twists and that along the way you'll meet new party members that you'll come to know and love. This is one heck of a 4-disc story.  Quests: There's plenty of things to do to occupy your time. Aside from the main quest, there's a few side quests that include freeing souls, battling an evil wizard, hunting a wolf, and collecting Stardust for items. Then there's even special enemies that drop special items. These are unusual foes you'll encounter on the world map that involve using a different battle strategy.  Gripes: As I've said, the graphics aren't the best, but put yourself in the year 2000 and they're mind-blowing. Another minor thing is that the voice acting is absolutely dreadful. But take heart, there are maybe 3 scenes in the ENTIRE game that use voice acting.  Overall: An incredibly awesome experience. It spans the length of 4 discs, is immensely fun to play, and is more than worth the $6 it costs on PSN. Do yourself a favor and play this game.	1
When you play this game, you'll notice how balanced the gameplay is. The weapons are decent and not too-overpowered, the items are limited to fair use, and armor is just-right. The story and dialogue was original. You can tell that the authors of this game were very sound people back then.	1
The game wasn't messed up! It kept freezing up at a certain part of the game. Not try a be a boob, but I'm just sayin.....	-1
I still remembered this game after all these years. I couldn't beat the first time I had it because the disk had gotten scratched. Amazon provided me with my baby after all these years. And its just as amazing as it was then, An amazing plot with a surprising twist!	1
This game has a certain charm that can appeal to younger folks. I do think seasoned RPGers will be disappointed though. Customization is pretty weak. Story is not bad but there's certainly been better. Graphics and cutscenes are beautiful. Battle system is kinda fun. Leveling up takes forever.  First disc was yawner for me. Almost gave up on the game. 2nd and 3rd disc however was worth the wait.  It's not a bad game at all. There was effort here. Seasoned RPGers expecting complexed strategies and menus like Final Fantasy or the Chrono series should probably avoid this. I can understand why people like this game. But I can understand others that don't.	1
This game is my all time favorite game, owned it long time ago when playstation2 wasn't even out yet. However my copy was lost and to find a brand new one unopened I was very happy.	1
Was trying to find this game for a while finally looked on here. This game has great interactive battle for an older rpg. Playstation sure had the best	1
What a generic title. Given the game, that's par for the course. The Legend of Dragoon is certainly the most generic game I've played on the Playstation. It's sort of sad, in many ways, that it was released by SCEA only months before Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy IX, and over a year after Final Fantasy VIII.  What's generic about it? Damn near everything. The main character is a spiky-haired blonde dude whose small village is destroyed by an evil empire, and who is designated the "chosen one" by a pendant, previously possessed by a mysterious stranger. Can you even name how many other games that borrows from? Do numbers go that high? And I forgot to mention, his representative color is red. Of course, the empire is still on the prowl, and Dart has to chase them with a diverse group of heroes.  And that's not even touching the translation- The Legend of Dragoon boasts some truly embarrassing translation errors. Square learned this lesson after Final Fantasy VII, which took a lot of flack for its stereotypes and writing, but that game had an interesting setting and strong enough characters to make up for it. The Legend of Dragoon wasn't just several years behind, it was at least two games behind by PS1 jRPG standards.  While the story is generic and perfunctory, it's not really the problem. Let's talk about the combat. The Legend of Dragoon's basis for combat is a series of timed button presses known as "additions." When one chooses the attack option, a reticle focuses in on the enemy, and a button must be pressed to time with the animation. While this basic idea has been done in other games, like Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy VIII, and the Mario and Luigi series, The Legend of Dragoon makes it the core of combat, and that's a fatal error. While timed button presses were integral to the games I mentioned, the important thing is that they didn't slow down the combat. The Legend of Dragoon's combat forces you to do this chain of animations every time you click attack, and when you miss, you get to see your character freeze in place as a number appears only once in front of the enemy. Random encounters, which are the majority of the game in RPGs, take forever and feel clunky. The Dragoon transformations- a flashy sequence comparable to Power Rangers- are also longer than necessary and the Dragoon attacks do little to change my complaints about the rest of the game.  The look of the game is very generic as well. While the pre-rendered backgrounds of the game look fine, the character models outside of combat are simplistic and poorly animated. The in-combat look is marginally better, and while the Dragoon transformations look good, the default character models aren't very detailed, and neither are the enemies. The combat environments look especially poor- many of the floors and walls are a single polygon with a blocky texture applied to it.  As far as I'm concerned, the great-looking cinematics don't count when we're talking about graphics, though it is worth noting that the ones in The Legend of Dragoon look great. But you might as well jump on youtube and watch all of them instead of playing the game, or rent Advent Children or The Spirits Within, or Shrek for that matter, if that's all you care about. The art design of the game doesn't lend itself to Playstation's technology.  I hesitate to speculate on matters like this, but The Legend of Dragoon strikes me as an attempt by Sony to cash in after the success of Final Fantasy VII. The game looks an awful lot like that game, with a fantasy setting substituted for a steam/cyberpunk one. I wouldn't call that an improvement.	-1
This game was made and published by Sony(Japan) and brought over to the United States. I'm glad they did because The Legend of Dragoon is a great game with great story, gameplay, graphics, and sound. So don't miss out on this incredible game done by Sony.	1
well this game has a very fun and unique battle system however it gets much harder to use the techs as your learn the higher level skills/the story is really good and has a great plot twist but is very slow getting anywhere for instance it has 4 disks and you find out the plost twist and the overall jist of the story at the end of disk 3.this game aslo has a very low exp rate which is kinda hard to level without eating up a massive amount of time.the voice acting is surprisingly great for a playstation game and for a game period.its aslo very straight threw gameplay so if you like a game with sidequests or hidden stuff this game might not be for you.	1
This game is very replayable first of all!  That's the most important thing I look for in a game.  Although PS1 games are from very long ago, this game has great music and graphics for its time, and most of all... it has an awesome storyline!  It takes a little skill to master the dragoon moves, but once you do as well as the heroes' upgraded moves you'll find this game very fun to play.  Just make sure you look at GameFAQs to find all the Stardust locations.  After playing this game once or twice, you'll find it a breeze but not too easy.  If you're into RPGs, this game is a must have!!!  ABC	1
I just recently purchased a dreamcast with a bad VMU so I had to get another one. Great little memory card for the Sega Dreamcast. Only one thing I had an issue with was that the battery in my VMU didn't last long at all, which wasn't too bad. Just bought some CR2032 batteries and that was resolved. Not worth taking off one star for that.	1
An essential item for any DC owner. The frustration of replaying difficult levels combined with the impossibility of progress are driving reasons to purchase this inexpensive accessory.	1
I already did a small review about the green VMU, so really you can just click on the green VMU on your screen and check that out if you want... Fine, I just do the pros and cons real quick here. Pros: -Can play mini-games on it -Capacity of 200 blocks save data -Act like a second screen for a lot of dreamcast games. Cons: -Buttons felt really cheep, even when you get a bran new VMU -Some games will eat up the 200 block of save data really quickly -Battery life is short  There happy? Now sho... Off! Off I say!	1
Simply put if this isn't a Sega Brand VMU i can't tell the difference. This thing works just like it is supposed.	1
works	1
Arrived broken. I don't know what I expected. Should have left it in the original box...	-1
Is one of my favorite games. When I first started playing it, it was doing good. Then it kept freezing and I had to return it.	-1
This was a gift and he loves it!  Came allot sooner than expected and was in excellent condition!!	1
works great	1
Saves games great	1
I got a Sega Dreamcast from a flea market with one controller but no memory card. This is working great so far.	1
Came quick as well with the rumble pack. Came in original package. Great collector item.	1
Awesome	1
Love it, it looks brand new and cheaper then used VMU at flea markets. Really good deal since it's in original back	1
I own a few of these Dreamcast VMU memory cards and they're pretty great. Designed well and they display graphics when playing Dreamcast games. You can even load a version of Tetris onto one for some super portable gaming. Although don't expect the batteries to last long. And a HUGE drawback is lack of actual memory. This problem is easily solved by putting a larger memory card in the secondary slot of the controller. A must have for any Dreamcast owner.	1
I love it. It saves your data and you can even play games on it. Depending what game you have of course. I am very happy with my vmu.	1
This game will always and unfortunately be compared to square's final fantasy VII. Sony unfortunately brought that upon themselves with the main character looking similar to Cloud and Lloyd having silver hair like Sephiroth. Despite all that Sony put out an excellent game that noone should miss.  Story: The story starts 10,000 years before Dart and company and brings along many twists and takes you along an epic journey. There are evil emperors and dragons to fight and control as you progress throughout the game. Again, the story is as old and original as you can get, boy likes girl, girl gets kidnapped, boy saves girl and world. Again remember its not the story itself but how the story is told that makes it great. There is a lot more to the story with 9 different playable characters each bringing their own story into the mix to help complicate the ultimate goal.  Graphics: This game is visually stunning from the cg clips that help drive the story along to the random battles. 3-D battles with stunning visual armor and Dragoon transformations are done really well. Dragons look rather funny, but everyone has there own take on how dragons should look, I wasn't to fond of most of them as some didn't look like dragons to me. I still don't understand why games like this and final fantasy don't have their characters armor change when you go into fight modes. They could take some notes from the makers of Legend of Legaia.  Combat System: I did like the "addition" system but an option to just hit a button and go through some random battles would've been nice. Dragoon transformation was awesome and unfortunately can be a rather long and annoying process making some boss battles last over 30 min's and thats with the shorter transformations. Magic usage was dissapointing as you can only use them while in Dragoon form and you only get 4 spells per character except Kongol who only gets 3. The spells and dragon summons are nicely done and Rose has a well....its different thats for sure. It would have been nice to change out Dart in the party so you could use different character combinations. For the most part its nicely done and an enjoyment to use.  Characters: Dart is your main character who is afraid to admit his emotions to Shana. Shana is your heroine who gets kind of annoying with self confidence issues but is easily overlooked. Rose is your quiet and mysterious character who is probably the most loved character in the game. Lavitz becomes Darts best friend in the game and is a loyal knight to the King. Albert is the King in the country you live in and is a key part in the beginning of the story. Haschel is an old martial arts and tries to be the comedic guy in the party. Kongol is your typical "dumb" strong guy and is used in most of your battles. Meru is your fun loving annoying character who has a lot of energy. Lastly there is Miranda who I thought was only a space filler and brings nothing to the table storywise or in fights.  Music: I liked all the music from the battle music to the love story music and all. The diologue was about average for rpg's but with everything going the way it was going at the time they needed to bring a more realistic and mature dialogue to the table.  The game is four-discs long and you can put in 65+ hours easily. The bad diologue is a turn-off for a lot of most gamers but you can easily figure out what is being said. The linear exploration of the world map wasn't great but did keep you progressing in the story and kept things moving along. Overall the cons in the game are easily over looked and forgotten about. This game gets an easy 5 out of 5 as Sony put together an extraordinary rpg that needs a sequel.	1
"I will stop you to go forward" the portal watcher of Ulara said to me, the main protagonist.  Of course what she meant was "I won't let you pass."  Above is just one hilarious example of the terrible dialogue in this game.  The dialogue is consistently this bad throughout the entire game, demeaning the characters, story, and entire game to amateur level.  Dungeons are the heart of this game's gameplay, which are long and tedious.  Same areas are used in different locations with at least one battle in each area.  The numerous battles and repetitious dungeons make the gameplay incredibly slow and dry.  Supposedly this game is well known for its cool battle quirks.  This is true, almost everything you do in a battle is effected in some way by player performance.  However I did not find this to be enjoyable.  After hundreds of battles I was pleading for the game to automate my attacks.  Repetition of button-timing and button-mashing mini games during battles became tiresome extremely fast.  Soundtrack was quite nice though, paralleling Final Fantasy series quality.  This however doesn't make up for the rest of this mess.  With poor story and gameplay, this game is not something I enjoyed playing.	-1
How else you gonna level up your chai?	1
Works great and is priced reasonably.	1
Works good.	1
If you've played other Japanese RPGs then you have a good idea of what you'll get from this.  I picked this as my introduction to the genre as I wanted to play a regular or average JRPG first to establish a good baseline as a comparison to the games I'd play later on.   I had a blast playing it.  Over 120 hours (most people will take less time - I'm a grinder) of playing time is a spectacular bargain considering that you'll pay far less than $10 for it.  The melodramatic story was a particular joy.   The most annoying part was the addition combat.  Maybe I'm totally inept but I was NEVER able to hit a level 3 combo and usually missed the level 2s.  Since the most powerful combos go up to level 7 that can be a problem.  But you can still win the game without doing well in addition combat - there are artifacts in the game that will allow you to hit the additions all the time.   I could go on but it would all be repeating things from other reviews.  The MAIN reason I'm posting this review is to help out the PS2 players who experience lockups or freezes that keep them from completing the game.  I had that problem as well and was able to fix it.   First off, I experienced rare random crashes but was always able to restore from the last save and continue the game without that crash repeating.  Save often!   There are 3 boss fights that will crash the game if you use Dragoon mode.  At the end of those fights, after the experience points roll up, the game will just freeze.  It will happen EVERY TIME if you use Dragoon mode in these boss fights.  (btw, the game has a LOT of boss fights.  They're very entertaining)   The solution to the first 2 fights is NOT to use Dragoon mode.  (At that point in the game your characters are at least as powerful without Dragoon mode anyway.  You just use different tactics to win.)  Those 2 fights are vs. Lenus & Regole at the end of disc 2 and the boss battle at Aglis on disc 4.   The 3rd boss fight is the final one against the big bad.  The solution is ... don't worry about it!  Go ahead and use Dragoon mode.  It doesn't matter if the game locks up because the game's over after you win anyway!  You still get to see the closing credits and what happens to each character and so on.  It might be possible to win the last battle without Dragoon mode but that fight is SUCH a struggle (it took me over 45 minutes to win on the first attempt) that I wasn't interested in trying it again without using Dragoon mode.   Summing up.  Good game and if crashes on your PS2 you can work around it.	1
When I heard this game was the Final Fantasy Killer, I just had to play it, being an avid FF fan. And I have to say, I was impressed. This game was great. A tad on the long side, but it hasn't stopped me from replaying it over and over. The characters are all fun and interesting, even with the whole Sentai thing going on. Sure, you can guess what'll happen by looking at the characters costumes, but it's actually very fun. The music is memorable, and the graphics are great as well (for a game this old). The story is deep and involving, much like other RPGs, and will keep you interested throughout the game's 4 discs.  The only bad thing I can say about this game is that the addition system, while innovative and fun, can also be tedious. By performing additions, you level them up and gain bonuses. These additions each need to be used a rather large number of times, forcing you to spend large amounts of time fighting just for the sake of using the additions. And considering how each of your characters has their own additions to master, it can take a very long time to master them all. Longer if you have trouble performing them repeatedly.  I'm waiting for this game to be re-made on a new system, but in the meantime, if you don't mind playing older games, you should definitely play this one.	1
great product	1
Worked as advertised.	1
this is the best RPG ever IMO. the unique and interactive turn based battle system was before its time. many people say there needed to be a sequel to this game for the PS2 and now the PS3. i'd settle for a remake or a prequel.    the story itself has interesting twists. at first its "save the girl stop the god of distructions, kill the dark monster that killed your family" but thens its like "wait the god of distruction will come along if you save the girl and btw...your friend you've been traveling with is the dark monster....oh but your pop is sorta not dead"  then you have the dragoon transformations which change the way you play when you attivate them. each character having their own element and attacks. it can compete with any of the final fantasy games. some will say FF7 is better but thats usually because it was their first RPG and it fits in with the whole being emo is cool thing.  but this a great tale of revenge, justice, and homicial retribution	1
This is a classic RPG that keeps you involved in the story line. One of the first action RPG's that made the genre a favorite of mine.	1
Right now I havn't beaten the game, but it is fun and worth a buy. I got it for about 5 bucks, still packaged. Story is good, playability is pretty addicting like most rpgs. It is a long game though, so if you have a lot of time on your hands, I suggest definately playing it if you like rpgs. I don't think it's as good as ff7 or ff10, which are my favorites, but still a great game and worth the money if you can get it for under 10 bucks.	1
Legend of Dragoon  is one of those role playing games that definitely gets credit for a story and events straying from typical. These warriors obtain these gems that allow them to transform into armored warriors and slightly change the course of battle.  The game features some nice cutscenes, nice graphics, SOME interesting characters, and an interesting plot only brought down by some uninspired or drab locales, a somewhat predictable or cliched set of events, and a few annoying voice overs.  Graphics- 7/10  Prerendered backgrounds that are quite lovely. Beautiful and action packed FMV sequences that are definitely worth watching. Transformations that are eye catching. Some of the character models are a little blocky; however, they animate quite well in and out of battle. They animate with such fluidity fit the game quite well.  Sound- 7/10  The music wasn't exactly epic, but it worked. Some of the music was a little monotonous; but it was suiting.  Sound effects were quite pleasant. Earlier in the game, you could hear the rushing of the water. Every action had a suiting sound effect.  The voices were both good and bad. The voices of the characters fit them perfectly, but some of the voice acting didn't quite fit with some of the actions of some of the characters; they were good for the most part though.  Story- 8/10  The story was quite enjoyable and unique. The story didn't drag too much and kept its pace. The one thing I can say is that the story itself didn't deviate too much...or at least the events that occurred during the story. Everything just falls into place nicely. The fact that the game revolved around warriors able to harness the power of "dragoon armor" was pretty cool.  Gameplay- 7/10  The gameplay is typical RPG fare. It seems the two ways to determine gameplay lies within how exploration takes place and how battles are played. Exploration takes place as most of the RPGs do; the battle is turn-based. Fighters can time their attacks (using X) to do a combo attack that can take more damage than just initiating an attack.  You can also transform into dragoons during battle which actually add to the strategy of battles. There is a basic attack that requires you to time your button presses which (like the character chain/combo attacks) can deal more damage the more times you press the attack button at the right time.  I recommend this game to anyone who's looking to play an RPG that is a little different in terms of characters and abilities. The Sailor Moon-esque element this game has definitely makes it different from a lot of the other RPGs out there. It isn't quite the "Final Fantasy VII" that the back of the box (or perhaps reviews) made it sound to be, but it is quite good and worth the try.	1
Good price. Item was received in box with original manual and packaging. The battery tab was still present and it works perfectly.	1
Excellent!!!	1
It's a VMU, and it works with all the games I've tried it with.  Included batteries were good.	1
It's a stylish blue memory card, not much to complaint about here. If it's your only one, like it is mine, it's a must have because it's the only way to save any game.	1
This game is incredible, and anyone who knocks it is most likely a Final Fantasy fan or just a moron.  If you have a PSOne or Two, buy this game and play it and you'll experience some true storyline and character development that takes a game from being just a game to being a great one.	1
I am a huge RPG fan, and when I saw this item on [...], I had to get it. I've had this game in the past, and now that I have it again, I can relive all the time I spent playing it. Great storyline, awesome gameplay, and overall one of the top RPGs for playstation.	1
This is the coolest memory card ever! Why can't another system be like this mini game boy and screen!	1
Perfect!	1
A Very Useful Tool! A Must for Dreamcast Owners! It also has a very cool function for fames like Sonic! Where you can Play a mini game on it that will effect the major game!	1
One of the most unique things about the Dreamcast was its use of memory cards that had LCD displays on them, which showed images relating to the game you're playing and even had minigames that could be played. It holds a decent amount of save data on it (although larger games like Shenmue take up most of it), and since each Dreamcast controller has two slots for VMUs, you can have up to eight of them set up at once without having to switch between them. The battery live is very poor, even with modern batteries (a brand new set only lasted a few hours each), and it uses a specific kind of button battery that may be hard to find. Also, both of them that I bought had slightly faded screens, but that is to be expected with old LCD screens.	1
Came with a new battery, in box.  Functions well and has no damage whatsoever.	1
i thought that this was a good game until disk 2 when it would not go any father so good luck	1
This came brand new in its original packaging and works great.  Now I can play Rez & Ikaruga again!  Thanks!	1
Was useful for my dreamcast controller and system, never failed me once. very good buy and would buy again if needed.	1
Actual Sega brand memory card. Battery even included with the device. Works exactly as expected. Nice blue color looks great with the blue Dreamcast controller.	1
i'm surprised they still make these new, I had to pull the tab on the back to initiate the battery and it works great, love the blue see through color	1
I bought my copy of Legend of (the) Dragoon when I got my PS2 (shortly after the PS2 release).  My Son and I fell in love with this game playing it time and time again.  The disadvantage was we couldn't play it together.  We stopped playing Legend of (the) Dragoon for two reasons.  Disc 2 became unreadable on either our PS2 or portable PS1.  The release of Final Fantasy XI for the PS2 sealed its fate in our home.  Recently, though, I find a video combining Final Fantasy XI with Legend of (the) Dragoon.  It reminded me of the fun I had with the story line, playing the Dart character, and how I got into fantasy role playing games.  So, I'm going to buy a replacement copy, pull the portable PS1 out of mothballs, and play Legend once again.  My only regret is Sony didn't do a follow-on to this wonderful series.  Honestly, I'm still waiting (yeah, I know I'll be waiting forever).  In the meantime, I'm playing FFXI and loving every minute.  Why is FFXI so great?  It's the real life players and my Son and I can play together even though we're separated (whether it be 5,000 miles or just a few).	1
The game as played by my son has an entire story line to it with many characters and places, lots of imagination.  He talks about it often, and put aside other games just to play this one, so it must be good.  Received product quickly and in good condition.	1
This game is pretty good because of its: multiple characters, items, weapons, armors etc. So for a long story, short this game is definetly worth picking up because you will have so much fun with it.	1
I have been playing RPG's on computers since I was able to first buy a computer. From the very first days of the text adventures like Zork from Infocom, back in the late 70's, until now, I have enjoyed RPG's on computer and console.  I'm no authority on RPG's by any means but for a console game, Legend of Dragoon is off the hook. It's a fabulous game with many of the RPG elements I appreciate: leveling, spells, magic items, lots of monsters, good storyline, etc.  Like Zelda on NES and Shining Force II on Game Gear, Legend of Dragoon has given me newfound respect for console RPG's. I have not played Final Fantasy so if that is the measure of a console RPG game, then perhaps I haven't truly experienced what a console RPG can really be like.  But, suffice to say that Legend of Dragoon has me wanting for more. If you're thinking about getting this dated game, even now, do it. It's well worth the money.	1
I played this game for several days, because although I was having very little fun from the start, I couldn't identify the reason. Usually, when I dislike a game this much, I always have some overriding reason why, such as "the story is a bore," "the battles are tedious", or even "the graphics are so bad that I can't even see it". LOD had none of these problems, but I just couldn't get into it. I got all the way up to disc 2, and yet it still felt like pulling teeth just to turn on the PSone, so I put it away and bought .hack. I wound up having a lot more fun, even though that game's story didn't make any sense--go figure. By reading the reviews here, it seems that plenty of other people were disinterested too, so I'm not alone I guess :)	-1
I love these little Virtual Memory Units (VMU's), they save game data as well as let you ply mini games from the "real" games you have saved on them, just plain cool.	1
so far so good, saved games well. has been dropped a couple times but no damage to files or the case.	1
Legend of Dragoon is one of those games that you either love or despise, I of course belong to the later group.  As one reviewer already mentioned, Legend of Dragoon was Sony's answer to rival Square-Enix's insanely popular Final Fantasy VII. I have to laugh when it took them three years to cook up this title that can't even dent the Final Fantasy fanchise.  I don't think the Final Fantasy series is the greatest thing since sliced bread (I actually like the Wild Arms series the most), but the only thing Legend of Dragoon really had going for it was its graphics, which I will admit where pretty sweet at the time.  Outside the graphical engine, Legend of Dragoon is second rate RPG in every category. Lame enemies, lackluster story, generic locations, and some of the worst music to ever accompany an PSX RPG ever (it's really that bad). Fights are also annoying due to the so-called "Additions" system which has you doing timed hits all day (yeah, that's what I call fun when I have to hit a button 8 times in a row at just the correct moment just to attack).  Other problems also arise, such as the fact no one can use magic outside of their dragoon transformations, meaning their is really no way to heal your characters except for items (which you become way too dependent on in this game, and can only carry so many). Outside the dragoon tranformations the battle system is very weak.  Play Legend of Dragoon only after you have destroyed every other PSX PRG. By that time you'll realize that this is not what any and all PSX RPG's should be compared against. Even if Final Fantasy is extremely overrated at times, even the worst FF is better than this. I don't think I'll play this one again.	-1
They always say that the Virtual Memory Unit, or VMU for short, was ahead of its time. And they said it with good reason. This baby was slapped into your DC controller to store game saves but it did more than that. It displayed your score in Sports games among other things. Some games even had mini games that could be stored onto it for portable play, like the well known Chao Adventure which acted as virtual pet.	1
This is the coolest memory ever released for a Game Console (Not the newer generation). Its has some preloaded games on it but the memory is not a lot, about 200 blocks.	1
Don't think I can say much more than I have in the title.  They can easily charge more on the basis that it's something that's been out of production for some years now but nope... reasonable price, clearly never been opened, comes exactly as it did "back in the day".  Battery inside with that little strip to prevent from corrosion - something that definitely would have happened by now :P	1
When I first bought my dreamcast about two years ago (ten years after it came out) i thought the vmu looked interesting. it is and its useful for some things but they couldve done better, the battery life kind of sucks but hey what can you do. its an interesting little device	1
Its the original, still working after 10 years on a shelf somewhere.  An interesting design, but light on storage space.  I would recommend the VMU tool which can be found online and burned on to a CD.  This program will boot up on your dreamcast and allow you to unlock additional blocks on your vmu and customize the image on the screen and install minigames.  There are so many reasons that the Dreamcast is still a relevant system 2 and a half generations later, and this is one of them.	1
I don't want to purchase one of the aftermarket VMU units that holds more data because they don't have a screen or support for the mini games you can put on the VMU. What a shame. This Blue VMU looks nice in my grey controller. I also have a green one so I don't get both of them mixed up. I highly recommend the official VMUs. Don't go 3'rd party. You won't be disappointed!	1
The VMU was a pretty cool piece of tech back in the day, born out of the Tamagotchi craze of the late 90's this is not only the source of memory for the Dreamcast but is also a portable gaming device. It has a small monorcome LCD screen, A and B buttons, as well as sleep and mode buttons. It works by being inserted upside down in the DC controller, very similar to the expansion solts on the Xbox and N64 contollers. You will notice there is a square opening in the contoller to see the screen during gameplay. It serves as a secondary screen, almost like the GBA did for the GCN. The screen works for various games in different ways. In NFL 2K1 you can use it to call plays so your oponent can't see what you're about to do, in Resident Evil it will display your heath meter without going to the status screen. You can also use the VMU outside of the controller. They can be used for mini games in various titles, and in Marvel vs. Capcom 2 you can trade characters if you link 2 of them together. They do reqire 2 watch batteries to run if not powered by the system. I'm told they don't last very long, but it does have a sleep function to help with that. I've never had a VMU with a good battery, so I can't say. You can tell if the batteries are dead if they beep when the system boots up. It has a slot on the bottom for a lanyard of sorts, or to be worn around the neck. I suppose if the DC had ever taken off it would be a cool addition, as it stands most kids probably don't even know anything about it. Finally it's primary function is a memory card. As such it does what it's supposed to do, saving and transferring data is a no brainer from the dreamcast's dasboard. There are the occasional files that cant be transfered (they have a red box instead of black around the icon in the dashboard) the problem can be alevited by booting the data up with one VMU, changing it out with another and saving again. Not the most elegant solution but it works because they can be hot swapped any time you aren't saving (otherwise the file will be corrupted). It comes with 200 blocks (128 kb) of flash memory. I got to be honest, it's not a whole lot, so I suggest getting 2 of them. If you need more memory than that a good option is the 4 way memory card which has 800 blocks of memory. It lacks the other functionality mentioned above including the screen but it does offer more memory. I reccomend against getting 3rd party, it doesnt pay to take the chance of losing your hard earned data to save a few bucks. Especially now that they are dirt cheap. The screens can be customized on the dashboard and come in a variety of colors to differentiate them apart. If you have a Dreamcast this should something you already own, if you're buying one, this should go along with you're purchase. It really is essential Dreamcast gear.	1
This game is beyond amazing! it's one of the first where they actually talk! and the battle scenes and the way the characters fight with additions is almost unmatchable!! This rpg is by far one of the best ever made and probably one that will always be one of the best! a unmatchable storyline and graphics are great!! a game that everyone should play.	1
I'll admit this game isn't perfect, and other RPG's for the PS have better graphics, animation, characters, storyline (though this is one great storyline), and certainly more emotion (I felt very little remorse for any of the characters)> However, this game has one fully unique feature that sets its combat system above any I have ever played: the additions. A quick explanation: the additions are combos that require precision tapping of the X buton, or O button when an enemy counters you (this can get extremely hard, as they'll likely counter during the hardest part of the combo). Each addition is different, the paces get harder as you go, but my god it's rewarding to see a completed addition and watch the enemy fry. I've seen many games that incorporate combos, but never an RPG that incorporates them so effectively.   Other pros include the animation sequences (though they sometimes appear in the most unlikely and random spots in the game, whereas others that should have animation do not), the voices/sounds, the looong storyline (lots of twists), and of course the Dragoon transformations. Cons include the poor world map (you have to move in select lines, you do not have free roaming like FF games), the cheesiness (oh yeah, on a scale of 1-10 this game ranks an 8 in cheesiness, and no we're not talking about cheddar), and the other bits I added earlier.   Overall a fine game, a bit in the shadow of other games that came out near this one's release (such as FF9, which lacks in storyline but is far superior in graphics/animation), but it has enough unique qualities to stand alone, and it really boils down to the combat sequences with the help of additions and Dragoon transformations.	1
I rember playing a demo of this game a long time ago and I loved it so I just had to buy it and I have owned this game for years now and I have beat it 3 times sence then and it can be compared to the Final Fantasy games. This has been my favorite game up untill Final Fantasy 9 came along. The price is worth it,the story is long (just the way I like them) and the game has "some" voice acting in it, I love the battles you can Transform into dragoon warriors (Think sailor moon but with out the nudity)And this is kinda what made me watch sailor moon in the 1st place now I own all the dvds. There are alot of nice CG'S in this game to help the story. and you get alot of main charaters to place in a battle formation anyway you like. Over all if you like Rpgs/final fantasys/pretty soldier sailor moon you will enjoy this game. Buy it!	1
This game was one of the greatest game i ever played. I have to say that the graphics of this game was a perfect ten. There is no way you can badmouth the storyline and the cinematic movies and i have to say that this game is good enough to challenge Final Fantasy 7 as  One of the best RPG's ever made. Seeing how other Sony RPG were so disappointing, Sony reedemed theirselves with this powerful Four disk adventure. It is game worth checking out.	1
if you have a dreamcast..you probably have more than one of these...the cards without the screens are probably still cheaper and chances are you won't need the screen anyway.	1
Simple fact, the VMU was the best memory card ever made. And, chances are, it always will be. With it's own screen you could see in the controller while playing, it often gave you extra information or mini-games you couldn't get elsewhere. Played cool animations while you were playing, and mostly just sat there and looked cool.  If you managed to get a battery for it, you could even play some extra mini-games after you pulled the thing out of your controller. It was like it's own little mini-gameboy getting stuck into your controller. It's just too bad game designers decided to go back to the boring old flat memory cards after the dreamcast died.	1
This is OK and the bad thing is sometimes you have to replace the battery which allows you to play the mini games.	1
This thing RULES ALL MEMORY CARDS TO THE POINT OF NO END!!!!! So what is the matter with it? No they are wrong, I saved one 2K2 game and one Capcom vs. SNK 2 game on the same VMU, believe all when said "A must have!" It truly is!!!!!	1
The Legend of Dragoon has a very innovative battle system that uses combination attacks called "additions".  This is innovative partly because it does require constant concentration and precise timing to execute.  Basically, additions allow your characters to increase the damage caused by their physical attacks.  You have to push the controller buttons at the precise moment in order to execute these additions.  And, do not expect to master all of the additions for any of the characters.  The most powerful additions require too many timed button presses to execute reliably. The story is fairly standard RPG material.  You play as the main character, Dart.  Dart is on a journey to avenge the destruction of his village and the death of his parents.  Along the way, he meets up with some very eccentric adventurers who follow him on his quests for their own personal reasons.  What starts out as a journey for revenge turns out to be something more significant.  As the story unfolds, it turns out that what people have believed for 10,000 years may not be the actual truth.  What God had in mind for humans may not be in our best interest.  Dart and company travel across three nations to try and unravel the mystery. This game is a very good alternative to the Final Fantasy series for those who love to hack, slash, bash, and cast spells.  The battle system here is much better than Final Fantasy X's.  This is perhaps the most sophisticated RPG for the original playstation.  Playing the game in a PS2 supposedly gives the graphics a boost, but I have not had a chance to compare them side by side.  I can say that on a PS2, the graphics are very good.  The soundtrack sounds great and the variety is wide enough so that the game is pleasant to play for long hours at a time.  I believe it took me over 100 hours to finish the game and the side quests.	1
This game is so much fun I've played through it 3 times. It has good graphics, great gameplay, and an awsome storyline. It's not a Final Fantasy, but who cares, this game's got it all!	1
If you are one of those losers that sit around and have to be "loyal" to final fantasy, then you should be shot.  This game is a great rpg that everyone should play.  the only bad part of the game is when you fight with sissy a** Shana during the first disk.  I have beaten this game 3 times and i know everything there is to it.  Probably the best part of the game is the additions that you must perform to maximize your damage.  If your a clumsy piece of s*** than your gonna suck at this game.  These additions are hard, and when i say hard i mean "hard."  This game has a great storyline, great characters, a fun battle system, and is one for the ages.  If you are stuck and need help u can instant message me (my screen name is the same as my nickname).  I know this game inside and out and i know other rpg's inside and out and this is truly a great one.	1
Considering past memory cards for past systems may not have had all the memory one could have hoped for, Sega decided to change things up when they released the Dreamcast. The Dreamcast VMU (Visual Memory Unit) is a step ahead in designing home system memory cards. Included is a small LCD screen with working buttons to play mini-games along with other features (for example raising Chaos in Sonic Adventure or playing a Pac-Man type game with Namco Museum). You can take the top off the VMU and transfer files into another VMU or link it up to play mini-games together. The VMU can hold up to 200 blocks of memory, and while this may seem like a lot, most of Sega's 2K2 sports titles take just about 200 blocks of memory just to save options let alone a team season. Not to mention that after a while the battery life of the VMU LCD screen will die, and that happens quicker than expected, but the LCD screen isn't necessarily needed if your just using the VMU as a memory card and nothing more. All in all, I would recommend at least 3 or 4 VMU's for Dreamcast owners; they're cheap and affordable and you can still find them at game retailers.	1
The Sega VMU is simply amazing. It is not just a memory card, but it also shows the last time you used your game, a clock and games that you can download of Sega Net. It also has a great LCD screen which you can use to choose your plays in football games so your friends don't cheat. The only problem is the battery power is weak and it the VMU only holds 200 blocks which is just enough to save one Sega Sports 2K2. The Sega VMU is still a great deal ...	1
An excellent product for it's price. The only improvement I could think of is to increase the memory capacity and sell for a higher price. Sorry to see the Console Empire of Sega has fallen.	1
what can you say about a VMU. first, always buy the real deal, not a third party product. i've seen so many other bad reviews about 3rd party vmu devices that i wouldn't consider getting a non-sega. go buy them now though, because hardware will soon be "hard" to come by. i've still found several of these in retail stores, but nowhere online unless you get used. unfortunately it looks like people selling used are asking over twice the normal price. yes it holds 200 blocks we all know that, and we all know that it shows little pretty pixelated icons to represent the game you are playing. maybe i'm the only one who tried this, but if you are playing a two player game, and you have your vmu in the 2nd controller, you can't see an icon on it or access it. as soon as i moved the vmu back to the first controller, voila, the icon and the option to access it. personally i haven't played any little tiny games on it, but i have taken my saves with me to other units with ease. if you are going to play games on it, just get a game boy! atleast they have colour screens and you can SEE them :) anyway. the only downside on this is that i have lost the little cap that goes on the end of it, because, the controller doesn't have a little place on it to store the cap when you have the VMU installed... so...the lesson learned is that if you remove the blue cap, don't forget where you put it while you are using the vmu, because it's good to protect the connectoids when transporting it to and from. so far i've used the same VMU for 4 games, and no issues with saving, retrieving or accessing. they should make this in other colours like grape, or aubergine.	1
This is one of my favorites, it has great battles and charecters. allthough i think that alot of people don't like it.  i think its a great game that everyone with a playstation should have.	1
Legend of dragoon is the closest thing you can get to final fantasy without actually having final fantasy.  The characters are interesting and the plot is immensely creative.  The combat system needs a little work, though (it relies on well timed button taps and if you don't get them just right, you wind up doing virtually no damage) and some bosses are just a little too hard, even by normal boss standards.  This game has countless hours of gameplay, though and once you get into it, i gaurantee your family will be seeing very little of you for quite a while.  have fun!	1
Legend of Dragoon was said to be one of the PSone RPG game that could be compared with the Final Fantasy series. This game does have a very good story with twist of plots. The in game movies are really good and with good sound effects and voice over. The environments in the game are also very well done and detailed made, which is a huge credit for the game. This game also adopt both types of battle encounters - random and touch base, which feels like utilising both ways to attract gamers to play it. The battle system is very Final Fantasy indeed. Turn based menu with different commands. The biggest feature is the Addition which requires skillful timing to get the biggest damage on the enemies. Nonetheless, it will be frustrating if you are in a boss fight and just missed one button that your can't finish the addition. The upside is you can purchase item (but at high cost) to ask the computer to finish the additions perfectly for you. Also the enemies will counter attack you if additions are done manually, which adds the difficult in physical attacks. Magic attacks are limited to using magical items, which lacks flexibility. At the same time, you can only hold 32 items at one time further limits your flexibility as some useful items are reuseable and must be kept to get your through the games; that leaves limited space for magical items considering you will need to use a lot of healing items if you characters levels are not high enough. The most annoying part of the game is the SNAIL PACE levelling up. Since all the experience points are shared by all members in the battle, this largely reduces the points each character can get in a single battle. Considering at a certain level, you need more than 10 thousand points to level up and every battle just earns you 200 points! This might be the reason that many people just finish the game with great effort at level 35-50 ....The highest level you can get for your characters is 60 but it will take you more than 400 hours to get most of your characters to that level. After level 60, the character will continue to receive experience points but without levelling up ...Another annoying part is sometimes the character selection screen just pop up without a reason and you will find that your original party was moved and substitute by other characters, which will then require you to choose again without a reason. Also good items are very difficult to find and some of them cost you a huge fortune to get. The development of the characters are also not as flexible as those in Final Fantasy for you can only equip them with certain stuff and some of those stuff are really useless. Anyway, the game does have a good story and some good graphics, considering it is a PSone game. Just need to bear with those pretty annoying characteristics of the game.	1
Simply one of the most entertaining, engrossing, and lengthy RPG titles available for the Playstation. Amazing!	1
My first impression of this game wasn't very good. The battle system wasn't easy to adapt to at first, the translation didn't draw me in and I found some of the characters to be damn annoying, so I put the game away to collect dust on the shelf. One day I was bored so decided to pop the game back into my PS. And I instantly changed my mind on how I viewed the game! Where should I start? Well the game is based on a VERY BIG world, which is seperated into each of the four discs. Each disc is used to travel each of the four major continents, and locations on them. You play as Dart, a male mercenary who has returned to his new hometown after adventuring for awhile, looking for a clue as to what destroyed the town he was born in. He arrives to be attacked by a dragon, and is only just saved by a mysterious woman. He thanks her and runs off, to his village only to find it has been ransacked, and his childhood friend, kidnapped. And so the adventure begins. What makes this game unique is the fact that it has a battle system unlike any other. The only one I can think of that comes close is the Shadow Heart Judgement Ring system. The system here is to press the 'X' button at the right time, through the combo, to execute it properly. Though an enemy can counter during your move, which turns the spinning Square red, which means you must press the 'Circle' button else your combo is interupted and you take damage. Another exclusive feature of the battle system is that when you defend, you gain some lost HP. This is an asset in a dungeon, where you are nearly dead, as you can continously defend in battle until you are back up at full health, the command also reduces damage done by both spells, and attacks, and negates any status ailment effects. Thus you can not be killed instantly, poisoned etc etc when you are defending. The other good thing about the battle system is that if you ARE poisoned or dispirited, all you have to do is change into your Dragoon form, to get rid of the effect. Changing into a Dragoon costs SP, and allows you to use your exclusive Dragoon attack, or perform Drgaoon magic. SP to turn into a Dragon is gained with each successful combo hit on an enemy, or can be gained when your character is damaged whilst a certain item is equipped. A down side to the game is that you may only carry 32 items with you at once, meaning you have to choose carefully which spell items you want to keep,and whether or not you will need healing items, and medication. It makes the game alot harder, especially during a boss fight if someone dies and you find you have no Angel Prayers in your inventory. The other downside is the translation which can seem a little incoherent at time, but is still quite easy to follow. What drew me in about this game is it's storyline, and the voice acting in the CGI cutscenes. The story keeps you engrossed and guessing right the way through as to who is who, and what is what. With such a colourful cast of characters, including the comic Meru, who falls over as her victory pose, what is not to like about this game?	1
Legend of Dragoon was a good RPG. The battle system consisted of the traditional turn-based battles. Each charcter had 3 to 5 unique combos that you had to learn. Yes had to, without the combos fights are pretty futile. The boss fights are very fun to play and watch, as your charcters {as well as bosses} do flashy exagerated moves. That alone makes battles funner than your average RPG. The storyline is pretty original with its share of twists. All is not well however, for the game takes a serious downfall in character design. You'd find yourself thinking "haven't I seen him in another RPG?" To make matters worse, due to the characters wearing obvious colors, "via - Power Rangers" you'll know your future party members before they even join. This game kept me occupied for a good while. Characters didn't interest me, but the combo learning and flashy boss fights saved it.	1
Of all the mysteries of the universe which I encounter each and every day, one puzzles me more than others.  Is it quantum theory? No.  What about how life originated? Nope.  No, that mystery is: how in the world does this laugher of a game still command such fanboy clamoring? The Legend of Dragoon was never a huge success - the title was heavily discounted pretty early on. I rarely buy anything but new games, but I only purchased this when I found it used at a store. Strangely, two copies of each disc was put into the case. I figured early on that I hated this game, and returned one copy of the disc, together with the case, for a full refund. Thus, I got the game for free, and I still think I didn't get my money's worth. I recently replayed it, in hopes of giving this a more "balanced" review. I still don't get it.  Let's start with the story. Is it offensive? No, but it's certainly generic, and boring to a fault. I won't spoil it, because people look unfavorably on such things, but it lacks any sort of imagination. This can't only be the fault of the localization (which is atrociously bad - read on). Expect to be accosted by boring titles like "the Black Monster", who appears once every randomly-selected number of years to do bad things. Color-coded heroes? We've got 'em; Power Rangers live on! And of course, I already commented before on the "spiky-haired protagonist following a silver-haired antagonist" in the earlier iteration of this review. Because, you know, I've never seen THAT before.  I have seen few translations as bad as the translation of Legend of Dragoon. It is laughably stupid, and the telling of a story is at LEAST every bit as important as the story itself. Homer Simpson's immortal phrase "He card read good!" would actually be an improvement of some of the dialogue here. Maybe it's more "authentic" in regards to the original Japanese. Yeah, and maybe the protagonist of Star Ocean 2 was really named "Crawd" instead of "Claude" (that's true, BTW). I don't know. I don't care. A translator's first goal should be to create something readable by non-specialists.  A lot of people have praised the soundtrack. The same words come to mind - generic, derivative, non-specific. The boss theme is particularly bland. Moreover, the recording is poor. It reminds me of the muted soundtrack of FFVIII, and it is nowhere NEAR as interesting as many of the soundtracks on the PS1. Putting this game up against, say, Valkyrie Profile or Final Fantasy IX is just unimaginable to me.  But soundtracks and stories are no longer reasons to snipe JRPGs (at least, given the lousy releases this generation). What about the gameplay? Well, needless to say that even if the story and soundtrack were as "beautiful" as many say, the gameplay alone would probably be enough to give this 1 star. It. Is. Atrocious. This might be the single most boring game I've ever played; even as a veteran of TONS of lousy JRPGs going back to the NES, I have never been as bored with battle and general travel as I am here.  Where do I even start? Battles occur randomly, and the load times are absolutely atrocious. It takes forever to get to the point of fighting a battle. If it were not for the derivative story, I would think that the developers never bothered to look at Final Fantasy VII. Every time a battle is encountered, the screen kind of...melts away in lines of sand. It takes forever. The encounter rate itself is not overly cumbersome, but it's frequent enough that you will notice this immensely. I would estimate that simply waiting through load screens adds as much 5 hours of time to your gameplay. That is no joke.  Battle is turn-based, but your attacks depend on rhythm games, similar to Guitar Hero. This isn't a terrible idea in and of itself, and if used sparingly, it could have really spiced up boss fights (such as the implementation of QTEs in the original GoW). But you have to do these stupid games for every single battle. It is incredible to me that people have the patience to put up with this. It's not difficult by any stretch of the imagination. It's just remarkably tedious (and I mean tedious in the way that killing 60,000 enemies for 2 of the 900 battle trophies in Star Ocean: The Last Hope is tedious).  Moreover, battle works from a defensive frame of mind, rather than an offensive one. In other words, you rarely go all-guns-blazing. Unless you over-level (which takes less time than fighting it out as the developers intended, BTW), expect to defend often. Expect to burn items. Expect to leave dungeons to re-stock. None of this adds difficulty. It just adds time and tedium. In some ways, I'm happy that the story was so perfunctory - if I were actually interested, I might have hated battle even more. Occasionally (VERY occasionally), you will have the opportunity to power up into your colored Power Ranger form. This is fun, but it's too rare to really enjoy, given the number of slog battles you will fight.  Finally, to add insult to injury, the game freezes. It's not so often as to be unplayable, but it's often enough to show just how rushed this job was (incidentally, to answer other reviews, this game freezes on PS1, PS2 and PS3 - an equal-opportunity offender).  Another major annoyance is the fact that you have to switch discs simply by moving from town to town. Again - did the developers not play FFVII? This actually made me give up on the game years back, when I initially purchased it. It was the reason it took me almost two years to finally put it out of its misery.  I just don't get the love for this mess. It in no way commanded this respect at the time of release. The game sold pretty poorly in Japan, and while it did OK here, it was nothing special. Reviews at the time were mixed. The sad truth is that even the dreck that the JRPG market currently offers today is often better than this. For example, I think Cross Edge is a better play than Legend of Dragoon. If you're looking for a great nostalgic game of the PS1 era, do yourself a favor and avoid this - there are TONS of great games available in the JRPG's Bronze Age.	-1
this game is among the best ive ever played, it has the best cartoony graphics ever, next to Grandia 2.  well anyways on to my AHEM! proffesional review. Graphics 10/10: oh my god, they are incredible by any standards. no blocky textures here just amazing cartoony graphics, the CG graphics are also incredible, on par with the best ive seen. if your a fool who thinks if a game doesnt have ultra flashy graphics it sucks just check this out and your world shall be aletered. Story 8/10: its really in depth at first with many plot twists but all the same its your usual, get amazing power, save the world from big evil sorcerer while killing giant monsters and bosses. Gameplay 10/10: the innovative combat system makes chaining attacks to inflict psychotic amounts of damage is great but some are irregulary hard to pull off. the whole game is great with extensive amounts of charcetrs control which is a good thing.	1
First off I'd like to say I should not be the judge of this game, Because i've barely even started it. I should not be the person to tell you whether or whether not you should buy this game. Graphics:10/10. You'll either love them or hate them (I loved them). It's a mixture of really good 2-d backgrounds and 2-d/3-d people. Sound:7/10. The voice acting there is, is pretty good. Other than that everything is just average. Control:8/10. Not much to say. Easy to pick up and play. Cinemas:9/10. Aren't too many but are sweat graphics and pretty cool. overall fun:8/10. This is a unique, fun game with few flaws	1
This was an amazing game; the movie scenes and the plot were wondrous. The plot developed slowly enough to keep it mysterious but the game moved quickly enough to keep you interested. The twists and turns of this epic story were really good; you couldn't really predict what would happen next. The graphics were great and I loved the battle system. It did take a bit of getting use to, but once you got the hang of pushing the buttons at the right time it was very exciting and fun. Extremely well made game, I could replay it over and over again.	1
"Legend of Dragoon" is similar to Final Fantasy games in that the battles are turn-based; involve weapons, items, and spells; and players get the option to levil up their characters for stronger attacks and more HP. On  it's own, it is a fun, satisfying, and worthwile game. But it definitely doesn't hold a candle to the FF games. Though the battle system is familiar to any RPG fan, it is the graphics that really give this game the edge. Boasting "3 years in the making, with a design team of over 100", their efforts were well spent. The battles are challenging enough, while the enemies are challenging and diverse. In terms of control, it is similar to most of the FF games, so it doesn't take long to master battles and manouvering. As the game progresses, the characters get stronger, allowing them to inflict even more damage. Overall, this is a challenging and rewarding game. But sadly, this game is tainted by a few minor flaws. The cliched "Unlock the mysteries of the past" plot is nothing we haven't seen before, add to this the paper thin characters that we couldn't care less about.  There are some technical flaws that need addressing. First, the number is items that can be carried. Why is it that you can carry 256 "Armed" items (weapons and armor) but you can only cary 32 standard items (like healing potions and cure potions, which is what you most often need)? Another flaw is that, unlike the free roaming of FF games, you are confined to the dotted lines on the world map. So there is little room for exploration. One thing that particularly bugged me about this game is that the plot is so linear, meaning that the side quests that we enjoyed with Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 3 are not prevelant here. But these are minor flaws, considering that the point of the game is to fight until the end to save innocent people from bloodshed.  This is not a deeply involved RPG, but rather more like an action  game with RPG undertones. Not bad at all.	1
This is a great game, its funny, fun, exciting, and mkaes you actually think in some parts.  It starts with Dart (Main Character), in the woods, and then he gets attacked by a big green dragon, and then another character comes in and saves Dart. You go on into Seles, and run into some enemies.  They are very tough since you only do about 1 or 2 damager per hit.  Well, this isn't a walkthrough, but there are tons of walkthroughs about this game. I suggest that you level up any chance you get, there are some really tough monsters in this game.  It is a fun game. The sad thing is, wherever I walk, there are 10 games almost exactly like it.  I mean this game is almost exactly like Final Fantasy 7, the main character has a big sword in both, both have a girl that they keep around and.  There are many similarities between the two, and I am just rambling on. I've read a lot of the reviews, and most are right in what they say and I agree with them, but I like the game, and I hope you like it too, happy hunting. Mark_Sigel	1
This is the first RPG I couldn't finish. Its not because it was difficult. I stopped playing out of my own will because ths was, simply put, the most generic, boring RPG I have ever laid my eyes upon. What would have become a great game changed into a catastrophic failure. First off, these characters looked like they were taken from FFVII, given a different haricut, and stripped of all their personality. Dart looks a lot like Cloud. Shawna looks a lot like Tifa. See some sort of resemblance here? Now if only the in-game 3D models moved and looked as good as Square's offerings. The characters lack any real depth of color, and the animation is choppy. The music lacks any power at all; this was also the first game I turned the sound off for. The songs were too repetitive and the voice-overs were pathetic. Now my main gripe: The plot. What kind of half-assed shit is this? As one person put it, "I've seen a Power Rangers episode with a better storyline." The plot does nothing to keep you in its grasps to make the game at leats somewhat attractive to its players. The first plot twist will occur at the end of the second disc. That's about 20-25 hours away for things to get interesting. That would be a little forgiveable if only the characters weren't so damn boring. Each character sounds the same, they lack diversity, with one exception: the really big guy that sounds like a retard (I can't remember his name at the moment). I will, however, give credit where credit is due: This game, while it has lackluster character models, also features some of the finest looking FMVs and backgrounds to ever grace the Playstation. If you're a gamer that enjoys great eye candy most of all, this is the game for you. If you enjoy strong plots, go with Xenogears (if you can find it) or Chrono Cross. If you like three dimentional, realistic, likable characters, pick out a Final Fantasy or a Lunar game.	-1
This was a great game.  The storyline, while not completely original, was very well written; the sound was great; and the graphics were amazing.  The backgrounds were some of the most detailed I've seen.  Also, the combat system was nice in that it did something new that went beyond a mere push of a button for an attack. The combo system used in this game takes timing into account during battles.  Timing button pushes to the display onscreen results in more hits and additional combos the more they are used.  The Dragoon aspect of the game was very interesting as well, but it seemed underutilized.  That is probably my only complaint about the game.  The battles were such that you really only used the Dragoon agains bosses because you'd want to keep using combos in regular attacks to increase your power.  That's only a minor complaint though. The sound was great.  It was very full and escaped the high, whiny music often found in RPG titles.  The story, while as I said not original, is very well done.  Characters are very well developed and interaction is good.  This adds to replay value because you can't really use all of the characters throughout the game, but need to focus on one group.  There are enough characters to choose from that in replaying the game you can use all different characters. This is a very solid game.  Not as good as Final Fantasy VII (but I doubt any game will be), but much better than Final Fantasy VIII.  The combo system is a nice addition.  I highly recommend it.	1
I have to admit that I was like many people who compared this game to Final Fantasy.  I thought the beginning of the game was kind of boring, but since I paid my money for it I did not stop playing it.  After a while I started to get really addicted to it.  I learned to love it.  No it isn't Final Fantasy, that was established with the name of the game, there aren't very many games that are Final Fantasy.  If you like rpg's I think you will like this game, and stick with it if you don't like it at first, it gets much better.	1
People who expect too much from a game should be ashamed of themselves.  You people need to understand that this game is NOT Final Fantasy.  Don't even expect this type of game to be like it.  People who have given this game bad reviews have honestly not given this game a fair enough chance. The storyline, was awesome.  It needed a little bit of fine-tuning, but otherwise, good.  The battle system is also really unique.  You use a special ability called "Additions", for when the cross [X] button is pressed at the proper time, you can increase the power of your attack. The translation of the game can leave somebody a little bit frustrated from time to time, with some bizarre grammatical errors (ex.  "Oh my god?!"), and some of the dubbing over with the CGI was out of place. If you take away those errors, this really is a good, high class game.  The battles can get a little bit repetitive and boring, and the battle music could take a little bit of time getting used to, but some of the music composed is breathtaking and unforgetable. Give this game a chance, and rent it.  Or, if you're the type of people who like every single game you've ever played, buy it, enjoy it.  Regret it you will not, guaranteed.	1
I've nearly finished this game and I must say I have really enjoyed playing it.  The storyline is engaging, the characters interact well and the graphics and sound are pretty.  Once you get the hang of how to make the characters do their special attacks, you can really do some damage.  Be prepared to hang in there for 70+ hours, though - this game has four CDs.  Each CD is a different Chapter in the story.  I can't give Prima's Strategy Guide for this game five stars, though.  It helped me once when I was stuck, but it is surprisingly vague in most of its walk-throughs (as a lot of these guides tend to be).  I consider Legend of Dragoon a fine addition to my RPG collection.	1
In my mind tied for Number one as the best role player out.  The only other game that competes is Vagrant Story. Dragoon pulls you into a deep  plotted story involving a group of strangers who seem to come together by  coincidence, but you soon learn they are brought together for one reason,  The legend of Dragoon, and the dragoon spirits.  This game involves  dragons, monsters, evil villians and some truly mind boggling puzzles. One  of the few games you can't stop playing, and when you do, you begin  wondering when your gonna start again.  If you know anything about  entertaining video games, then you know about this.	1
It's pretty damn hard to find a well kept Dreamcast controller these days. I'm very glad I bought this product.	1
Got it used so it was a little dirty (too be expected) but it worked great, and makes my dreamcast that much snazzier.	1
The setup of the Dreamcast controller is cool and it comes in different colors. This one happens to be blue and it's just like the other controllers. It's not hard to get used to this controller and just like the others it can hold tremor packs and the VMUs. The only set back is that the cord comes out of the front instead of the back. There is a little hole that you can put the cord through but it would've been better if it was just put through the back so it wouldn't be in your way while you're playing. Overall, it's a cool controller.	1
Considering how bad the first one was I didn't expect its sequel to be any different.  It wasn't combines the worst of all worlds, chessy soudtrack, chessy graphics and a missions operations manual that defifes all logic and reason.	-1
This game was actually a freebie when I bought Star Trek Deep Space Nine Dominion Wars. I recently bought Star Trek Starship Creator Deluxe which was made a year before this Warp 2 sequel. Starship Creator Deluxe has much more ship constructions to chose from than the new Warp 2 has to offer. In Warp 2 you only get Akira, Soveriegn, Intrepid, Constitution, Defiant, Galaxy, and Klingon B'rel Class Ships to construct. In Starship Creator Deluxe (which by the way includes Starship Creator and Starship Creator Add-on) you may construct from more than 10 different ships - Excelsior, Miranda, Constitution, Defiant, Akira, Oberth, Prometheus, Soveriegn, Intrepid, and Galaxy. Warp 2 has less ships and the missions are pretty boring. You could sleep through it and the mission would still be successful. The computer plays the missions out without any real play control from the player. You can however design that dream starship you always wanted to create. If you really want to buy a Starship Creator, I would recommend buying the Star Trek Starship Creator Deluxe which allows the player to create 10 federation ships whereas Starship Creator Warp 2 allows only 6 federation ships and the additional one Klingon B'rel. On a plus side, Warp 2 allows the player to export their designed ships of Akira, Galaxy, and Defiant into Star Trek DS9 Dominon Wars multiplayer mode for gameplay online. However the Galaxy class starships that are exported into the Dominon Wars Game turns out to be invisible (A really big bug/glitch!!!) Some ships appear to not have been modified at all during exporting - such as Akira class ships and they appear to be discolored (example: Engines powered down, and lights on the ship are off even during combat). Gameplay = 3/10 Graphics = 2/10 Sound = 2/10 Value = 3/10	-1
This seems to be the general sentiment about this game and its true: It has all the problems that the first version has.  You get more ship hulls to work with, that is true, but that's about it. The game still has the same lame missions that take forever to play and ARE NOT FUN! Also, the user interface is still pretty much the same.  The developers needed to make some major changes in this version, such as being able to captain the ship you built (even in a limited "Star Fleet Academy" manner) and to unlock better hulls and equipment other than using the "credit" system. How about promotions to higher engineering positions? That makes more sense. I downloaded a money cheat so I could mess with different hulls without playing all those tedious missions. This extended the game's life on my PC by a week but I still got frustrated by not being able to fully interact with my creations. I though that was the whole point behind this game.	-1
Not quite as fun as I remembered.. but hey, I guess 10 years of newer, better graphics might do that. It's still fun! Brings back a bunch of old memories.	1
Rogue Trip is definitely one of those car-combat games you need to own. Like its' predecessors(Twisted Metal 1&2), it's full of frantic, crazy action. Only this one is a bit more zany and humorous, not as serious as the Twisted Metal series. It came out around the same time as Twisted Metal 4 but blew the doors off of that game. These guys know car-combat up and down. Sad to say, though, It's the first and last of its' kind. Seeing as Singletrac(Incog. Inc.) got its' TM license back, we'll probably never see a sequel to this one. And that's a bummer. I woulda loved to see one. If you love car-combat or just love car games, look into Rogue Trip...you won't be disappointed.	1
The creators of Twisted Metal 1 and Twisted Metal 2 makes another great game.  This game is definitely a good predecessor to the currently famous Twisted Metal: Black. This game is basically a car-combat game with a mission statement: pick up passengers, earn some spending cash, and take them to see the sites around the country, from the Washington, D.C. Mall to Hollywood.  Throughout the game, you basically use the cash to repair your car when it's damaged and upgrade weapons to attack your enemies better.  The controls are similar to Twisted Metal, and for the veterans of Twisted Metal, it shouldn't take too long to learn these controls.  The characters are also remarkably similar to Twisted Metal 2, but this game offers a humorous take on Twisted Metal.  You have characters ranging from Ratman to Agent Orange, and their vehicles are really insane.  The Specials range from a cutter-saw of the Ratmobile to the Stinkmissiles from Agent Orange.  The bosses aren't too hard either, and they are beatable, once you figure out their vulnerabilities.  The graphics and scenery are actually very spectacular, even for the Playstation.  The sparkle effects of missiles is a good piece of eye-candy.  The cars even have a nice shine to them!  The arenas are actually fairly large, and they are not claustrophobic and small like Twisted Metal 3. The major failure lies in the multiplayer, especially if one of the players is greedy.  Both players have to assist each other for it to work properly, and often, one of the player will die in the process.  Within two or three levels usually, the game will be over.  Overall, a great game, and this game should be included in any Playstation library.	1
My brother talked me in buying this game about 10 or 11 years ago at Revco I got it for $20.00 I've been in a lot of pawn shops flea markets and use game stores and never one seen this game at any of them it might be rare who knows well I'm glad I bought it you should get this its a good game.	1
Rating says the game is good, but it's definitely not for everyone.  Those who are used to the Final Fantasy series by Square will probably be  disappointed by this game because, quite simply - they are of different  genres.  FF is a pure, solid, RPG game without a trace element of Action,  Adventure, or Puzzle.  Vagrant Story, on the other hand, is a combination  of all 4 above genres - and the result is not only fun and entertaining,  but exciting as well. Breakdown- Graphics - Absolutely beautiful  detail, high polygonal characters with lush backgrounds and well-designed  dungeons.  It's good to see that Square does really good work with graphics  even without touching CGI FMV.  Lots of little graphical tweaks (like  accurate shadows, detailed faces) make this game beautiful to watch.  Best  of all, all of the cut scenes are presented using in-game graphics, with  almost cinematic camera shots and techniques - it feels like you're  watching a movie. Music/Sound - Great for atmospherics, but nothing too  memorable for me other than the intro music (played alongside the only FMV  sequence in the entire game).  This is probably the poorest section of the  game, especially given Square's reputation for hiring composers such as  Nobuo Uematsu to do their wonderful orchestrated music. Storyline - Two  thumbs up, the story progresses at a nice, even pace and there aren't any  ridiculous twists and turns in the plotline that make it sound forced.  The  ending is one hell of a clincher...and definitely some of the clearer work  that Square has done recently. Characters - Well developed, etc. etc.  I  like the characters.  We get to know them relatively well, and any  information that we don't receive isn't very important to begin  with. System - This is where the game shines.  The Parasite Eve style  battle system, offence/defence chain abilities, and workshop ideas are all  awesome.  Plus, for the hardcore gamer, technicalities such as weapon  vulnerability, elemental affinity, and monster type all play a role in  effecting the damage you do. It's a great game.  Buy it.  But only if  you're not one of those narrow minded people who thinks there is no Square  outside of Final Fantasy.	1
Amazing graphics, with easy to learn game play, and a story line seeming fit for a movie spectacular.  Follow in the steps of a lonely warrior  unsure of his past, searching everywhere for the answers while on the trail  of an evil black magic wielding villian.  Face off against dragons, golems,  zombies, ghost's, and some of the most amazing monsters, and bad guys you  have ever seen.  A True classic, Not matched by any game of any genre.  Finally a game that gets better and better, the more you play. one of those  games you will never want to finish, and when you do youll want to do it  again. Untouchable.	1
In the year 2000, Squaresoft was pretty much at the top of its game.  In that year they had a string of successes with games like Chrono Cross, Legend of Mana and Final Fantasy IX all dropping by for some time.  Strangely enough one of the most overlooked games during that time was a little gem called Vagrant Story.  Helmed by Yasumi Matsuno (better known as the mind behind Final Fantasy Tactics), it was a game that he knew from the moment it came out would only appeal to a particular crowd.  Vagrant Story wasn't for everyone.  Indeed, many a gamer either couldn't get into it or downright hated it.  Those who did get into it, however, fell in love with the game.  Matsuno has always had that "You'll love it or hate it," appeal.  This may also be because Matsuno's approach to designing a game has always been "different" than the typical developer.  There's no game in Matsuno's library that is as complex as Vagrant Story, however.  If you can get into it it's a rewarding and challenging experience.  Patience is required but for the time of its release it was probably one of the most reaching and original games out there.  Vagrant Story is set in Valendia.  A cult lead by a man named Sydney have abducted the Duke's son and taken him to the abandoned city of Lea Monde.  As Ashley Riot, your job is to infiltrate the city, find the Duke's son and stop the evil cultists.  Throughout the journey you'll also run into the Crimson Blades who are also out to stop Sydney for their own reasons.  As Ashley enters the city of Lea Monde he gets caught up in a game of cat and mouse with Sydney, who has a mysterious power to see into the past of his victims.  As you play through the game there are many moments of betrayal and characters out to serve their own ends.  It seems like a simple story at first, but as you dive deeper in it becomes more complex and engaging.  Though there are moments when it's slow, Vagrant Story isn't exactly long enough to mind some of its pacing problems, the likes of which are slowed down less by the actual progression of the story and more by the actual gameplay itself.  In the year 2000 most JRPGs were the same old typical turn based stuff.  Allies lined up on one side, the enemy on the other.  Vagrant Story does away with that.  Instead it takes on a more active approach to its combat.  You can walk around in normal mode or battle mode.  In normal mode your weapon is sheathed, as is your shield.  In Battle Mode you are ready for combat at any time.  Enemies roam around the map freely.  Vagrant Story fashions itself as a dungeon crawler.  Many dungeons are quite big.  When you enter a room there are usually two or three enemies.  When you engage them in combat you must bring up a battle sphere (referred to as a matrix).  Upon doing so you can select a different part of the body to attack.  Either their right arm, left arm, legs, body or head.  Each one affects different stats in some way and has its own HP listing.  For instance, if you keep attacking an enemies legs you'll reduce their movement.  Keep attacking their primary arm and their attack goes down.  Keep attacking the head and they'll eventually be silenced.  Keep attacking the body and their defenses drop.  You can also chain together attacks by setting them to different buttons.  The more you chain attacks together the greater damage you'll do.  Some chain abilities are designed for damage output but others are designed to restore HP or MP while others may silence or paralyze an opponent.  Chain attacks take time to master, however.  Each time your weapon strikes an enemy you have a brief second to hit a button.  If your timing is correct Ashley winds up for another strike.  Hit the button too early or too late and the chain stops.  While it's easy to chain attacks together, the game makes sure you don't take advantage of it by giving you a stat known as Risk.  When your Risk is low your is high and you take less damage.  As your Risk increases your accuracy drops and you take more damage.  On the other hand Risk does have its upsides.  You have a better chance of landing critical strikes and your healing magic will heal far more HP.  So you can take your chances.  Your accuracy is lower but your damage output (if you hit) is higher.  You take more damage but you can also recover more damage.  There are also defense abilities at play that work exactly as you think.  When an enemy strikes you, just hit the button corresponding to the defense ability set to it and Ashley defends himself.  As with chain abilities the timing is important.  Some defense abilities allow you to reflect damage, others let you absorb HP and others are just meant to help your defense against certain elemental attacks.  Vagrant Story has a deeper system than most games and we've only scratched the surface of what it is.  Certainly there are also various magic spells but they're used in the standard fare you would imagine them to be used in.  First you use a grimoire and then Ashley will master the spell.  Some require specific targeting but for the most part there's little complex about using magic in Vagrant Story.  What is complex, however, is keeping so many things in the background in mind.  For instance, every enemy has a class they fall into.  Human, Dragon, Beast, Phantom, Undead or Evil.  And they're all weak to a very specific weapon type.  We're not talking swords or anything like that.  We're talking either edged, blunt or piercing weapons.  Likewise, you also must pay attention to the elemental affinity of a weapon you're using.  Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Evil and Light.  It seems like a lot to take in at first... and it very much is.  Using the right weapon against an enemy makes the difference between dealing a lot of damage or dealing no damage at all.  The good news is that all of this can easily be manipulated through the games various systems.  You might start with a sword that doesn't deal a lot of damage to humans at all... but the more you use it the better it will be against human type enemies.  You can raise any weapons attack against a certain class just by using it on that class.  Thus, you do more damage the more you use a weapon.  Likewise, as you go through the game you'll find various gems to attach to a weapon as well to help improve how much damage you can do to a class.  Some enemies have elemental weaknesses as well which you can also attach gems to your weapon to exploit.  It's not just your weapons, but your shields as well.  You can easily attach a gem to a shield to improve your defenses against various classes and affinities as well.  All this amounts to a fairly complex game when you consider all of this.  But it also means that you'll find yourself constantly micromanaging throughout your journey.  You'll enter one dungeon where a weapon you've obtained and attached gems to works really well only to enter another dungeon where you have to change all of it.  It is certainly possible to go through Vagrant Story with just a single weapon, but you'll feel the need to change it up eventually.  Not only do all those class and affinity matches matter, but eventually you'll want a weapon made out of a different material as well.  You start with a lot of Bronze and Iron stuff that affects class and affinity damage, but you'll also find yourself using better material later that deals greater damage with little or no penalties at all.  Vagrant Story is actually a game that, if you grind enough, can be really balanced with its complex weapon system.  Every weapon has the ability to grow its class and affinity damage.  And wouldn't you know it, Vagrant Story makes sure you CAN do this.  Later in the game you'll come across various workshops that will allow you to make and combine your own weapons.  You could easily make a weapon that deals heavy damage to every class and affinity type in the game.  It takes a lot of grinding, but it can happen.  What's nice, however, is that outside of the boss encounters the game isn't too punishing.  If an enemy is weaker to a blunt type weapon but you prefer your edge type the damage isn't nearly as well affected as your class and affinity are.  Even so, however, there are lots of spells that can be used to boost any affinity you're lacking or that can be used to strengthen your attacks and equipment.  Likewise, you'll have plenty of spells that can decrease your enemies stats as well.  Unlike most games, Vagrant Story wants you to learn and utilize every bit of its system.  Particularly in its boss encounters where knowing the class and elemental affinity of your opponent is your key to victory.  Vagrant Story is a challenging game, but only to those who do not understand the mechanics of the system.  If you're fighting a water elemental enemy for instance, just boosting your attack and casting a spell that boosts your weapons fire affinity (as well as having the proper gems) will save the day.  If, however, you're not willing to micro manage and prepare for each boss, Vagrant Story is more than happy to punish you for it.  This is not a game where just knowing the basics will help you succeed.  This is a game that expects you to actually learn and utilize the system at play and isn't going to hold your hand to get you there.  If you aren't willing to read the game's instruction manual (or willing to read the Quick Manual in the game itself) then you'll find Vagrant Story to be a challenging and frustrating endeavor.  If, however, you spend the time to learn the complexities of the system, Vagrant Story is surprisingly easy.  The most challenging boss won't be a match if you understand what to do.  About the only thing that might hold you up is that Vagrant Story is large and sprawling.  The dungeons are huge, but more than that, the game isn't always telling you where to go next.  You'll often come across locked doors that you need to have a certain key or sigil for.  And when you get that key or sigil you'll need to find the door itself.  The good news is that while the game won't guide you back there, it has lots of tools to give you an idea of where you can or cannot go.  Each sigil has flavor text that tells you which dungeon it can be used it while the in game map always marks locked and unlockable doors for you.  Again, if you're not willing to utilize the system you'll be hopelessly lost.  You may still get lost, however.  While you'll know which doors can and cannot be passed through thanks to your map, the game still doesn't tell you WHERE you need to go a lot of the time.  There's a lot to explore in Lea Monde at least.  It's a huge game where there are lots of things to do off the beaten path.  Going back to old dungeons and grabbing equipment from otherwise locked chests or rooms is nice.  It's a shame, however, that most of Vagrant Story's best optional content is saved for after completing your journey.  Much of what you do must be done in a New Game+.  Many of the optional bosses and optional dungeons can only be played on replay.  While this sounds like a chore at first, it's remarkable how fast Vagrant Story moves.  Your first play through may take a moment because you're getting lost, but once you've experienced it once you'll come to learn that Vagrant Story is a pretty short game.  In a New Game+ you'll find these new areas pretty quickly and they'll keep you busy for a while.  Vagrant Story is close to perfect for its design.  For everything that seems like it'll give you trouble there is an opposite solution that will always work for you.  However, beyond its complexities what you realize is that Vagrant Story is most certainly not for the fast paced gamer.  It's short, but it won't feel short the first time through.  The battle system will make everything feel slow.  The combat always stops so that your enemies can cast spells and in some cases this is a lot.  Combat may seem very active, but at some point it's the same turn based affair you've always known.  But when enemies and characters take certain action everything stops while it's being executed.  This is not an action/adventure RPG, it's very much just an RPG.  In moments where all you want to do is get through the dungeon without engaging your enemies in combat this is particularly annoying as you'll always be stopped so they can have their attack.  Likewise, as a result of this you'll often have to stop and take a moment to heal any sustained damage.  While it's nice that your HP and MP will regenerate in normal mode, enemies are going to do damage quite fast when you're not interrupting their blows with your own (and even the normal enemies can do quite a bit of damage).  Other times Vagrant Story can feel downright unfair.  When I mention about having to really prepare for boss fights or else the game will punish you?  I'm not joking.  There will be bosses that, without the right preparation will take you down with a single cast of a spell.  Other times enemies will employ some strangely strategic tactics to make sure you don't stand a chance.  If you aren't willing to utilize the tools the game gives you it's not going to be a rewarding experience.  In an interview Matsuno described the game as being for "hardcore" players (a definition that has certainly changed from what Matsuno meant then) and he is certainly correct in that regard.  Vagrant Story is a game that the player can't hope to succeed in without fully understanding the systems at play, and the learning curve is a pretty steep one.  Many video games really ease you into things and make things quite easy in the event that not everything clicks for you immediately.  Vagrant Story knows no such forgiveness.  As such many a gamer is probably turned away from Vagrant Story because of its complexities.  There are a lot of things to keep track of, a lot of micromanaging to do and a lot of preparation that comes before every boss at a certain point.  All this culminates into what is still widely seen as a very complex game.  In some instances, without the aid of a walkthrough (at least for bosses) Vagrant Story can appear to be needlessly challenging without understanding the fundamentals of the game.  Even for hardcore players, however, some of the micromanaging can be a bit much.  There will be stretches where you'll feel like you're spending more time in the menu than actually exploring and playing the game.  As you use various weapons and grow fond of a favorite this will ease off, but until that point Vagrant Story is pretty strict about it's combat system and is surprisingly meticulous.  There isn't room for a lot of error and sometimes this can be grating to those new to Vagrant Story.  Even intimidating at times.  Many of Square's other games are far more accessible than Vagrant Story.  As I said, however, once learned Vagrant Story is a surprisingly easy game.  In fact, it can be a little too easy to get overpowered when you realize just how combining weapons and raising affinities really works.  So much so that it can be really easy to take advantage of it.  Once you know what class and affinity you're dealing with Vagrant Story is a pushover.  To make sure you can't get too overpowered, Vagrant Story has limited inventory space.  You can't simply run around with all your weapons.  Eventually your weapon inventory gets full and you'll be forced to dump a few in a container.  The same goes for armor and other items.  It surprisingly balances the game, but once again, can be a big hassle for those who aren't particularly big on micromanagement.  As far as Playstation games go, Vagrant Story was among the best looking ones out there.  Certainly games like Chrono Cross look a little better, but Vagrant Story, especially for all it does at a time, is quite a good looking game for its time.  The art style is very nice.  What really makes it work is the tone that goes along with everything.  It's a very dramatic story.  The dialog is some of the best written in any game Square has ever published.  The presentation is just overall very nice.  The dark and dreary tone is enhanced by the soundtrack which is just as magical, dramatic and dark as the game itself.  Everything about the presentation gives you an idea as to what kind of world you're stepping into.  This isn't a lighthearted fantasy.  A great deal of JRPGs have a tendency to go the more adolescent or more juvenile route with a lot of themes and intrigue, but Vagrant Story doesn't do any such thing.  Many characters are put in situations that feel hopeless at times.  It's a dark story filled with betrayal and political intrigue and it will shove this in your face.  And there are A LOT of politics in Vagrant Story.  And the deeper you dive into the story, the more interesting it gets as revelations are unveiled and character motivations come to light.  Vagrant Story is not a game for everyone.  It simply is not.  It's complexities and micromanagement systems can make the experience tedious for some players, while others may be turned away by how difficult the game will be without understanding them--especially because the game will punish you for neglecting to learn any of it.  This isn't a game where you learn the basics and keep going.  This is a game where you MUST dig into the systems and the mechanics because it's unrelenting if you don't.  However, those willing to dive and learn the system will see a Playstation game unlike any other they've ever experienced.  With a great story, some great localization and a very creative battle system, Vagrant Story is a hidden treasure.  It may not be simple and it may not fashion itself approachable, but the more you get to know it, the more charming it becomes.	1
It's an old game but still demands a sequel. If I remember right this was a time when Square fans were crying out for something new, different and innovative. Out comes Vagrant Story.  This is the most impressive PS1 game I ever played. However you are either going to like the combat or you won't. You will like the old school difficulty or you'll hate it. This game is a DnD dungeon crawler with an unusual combat system. Like Parasite Eve you operate within a battle grid picking body parts. It's hard to say whether this is turn based or real time. Guess a combo of both but surely unique and deep.  In my opinion the graphics, music, atmosphere, story and depth of gameplay is stellar. Never seen anything done this well on the PS1 other than Soul Reaver. Buy it. It's a classic!	1
This is one of those games Square released that seems promising, but falls short in one or many of ways.  The bulk of the game takes place in a dungeon. You guide Ashley through a series of rooms all while battling bats and cave-dwelling creatures you come across.  The battles take place in a real time fashion; however, fights run on a chain system. When you attack an enemy, an exclamation point appears above Ashley's head as an indication to press another attack button to continue your onslaught. Ashley has a variety of weapons he can equip which changes the way he attacks his oppoenent.  Instead of HP, Ashley has an "indicator" (starts out green to indicate full health) that determines his health. It is divided by his arms, body, etc. When the health of a part of his body is depleted, it is safe to say that that part of his body no longer functions until his health is restored. While the idea sounds cool, he is only character under the player's control. The game CAN be difficult.  Exploration takes place in a dungeon. The player will reach a room where a spell is necessary to get through the door. Sometimes the spells are easy to locate, and other times the player must backtrack through many rooms to obtain the necessary spell.  The graphics were among the best. The game had somewhat of a comic book feel to it--the character nicely animated and bore many details. The detail really brings a certain feel to the game and the dungeon, despite being a dungeon, actually looks quite nice.  This is one of the few games I will say is completed for or less for its story and gratification, not fun. There isn't much fun to be had as there is a lot of backtracking and scouting to be done with little or no deviation. The spells do add to the game, but not much.  Pros: -Graphics -Interesting Story -Intriguing Battle System -Interesting Villain -Chilling atmosphere  Cons: -Too much backtracking -Entire game takes place in a dungeon -How Many bats must I fight? -Where do I have to go next? -I forgot which way I was going/came from  If you must try the game out, I recommend renting it first. If you're a die hard Square fanatic, love games with a dark feel, or love dungeon crawlers, you will like it.	1
I never got to far playing this game. Up to the first save and after that I'm stuck and can't proceed in the game. So I really didn't like this game.	-1
Vagrant Story is the kind of game that is either love it or hate it. There really isn't too much in between. It features great characters and one of the greatest stories in any game released to date, but the amount of attention that must be paid to weapons and stats (along with some redundancy in battles) can really turn a lot of people off.  Let me start with a bit of the story. In the game you play the role of Ashley Riot. A man who is entrusted with the duty of being a Riskbreaker (essentially a one man army) who is entrusted to enter the lost city of Lea Monde to try and figure out an assassination plot that he has been framed for. At the start of the game this is all you know. You know that Ashley went to Lea Monde and was never seen again. Three days after he left, they declared him the murderer. Now you have to find out what happened in the city of Lea Monde and uncover the truth. With a supporting cast of characters lead by the wonderfully evil Sidney Lostarrot, Vagrant Story weaves an amazing tale of lost pasts and hidden truths (with some black magic and whatnot thrown in). Be aware though, the story isn't all happy like you will be apt to find in the Final Fantasy series, it goes much deeper into human emotion and psyche.  As for the gameplay, well, this is where it is either won or lost. Essentially the game is a dungeon crawler that has you wandering the dungeons of Lea Monde until you find a neccesary item to continue traversing through. There is a lot of backtracking but luckily half way through you learn a teleport ability that cuts down on that. You can think of it as similar to the backtracking in Resident Evil games for those familiar (find a locked door, need such and such key/item, find item/key elsewhere, go back and proceed).  All the while you will be encountering various monsters of different classes. While it may not seem like much, monster class is critical to how effective you are at the game. You have the ability to craft your own weapons and armor, each one can have special affinities to different classes. Essentially this means you will want a weapon that is effective against each different enemy class. This is where all the in depth stat management comes in (as well as a lot of use of the EQUIP function....). Attacking enemies is done in real time and allows you to pretty much attack indefinately as long as your timing is good for chaining attacks together. On top of that you can target individual body parts on every monster to weaken different stats (legs = movement, head = intelligence, and so on and so forth). By doing this and inflicting enough damage to one body part you can effectively nullify your enemies strength. Although it can be apt to take quite a while.  Graphically, the game is fairly bland even for PS1 standards. It is made almost with a sketch visual, where there are multiple lines to every section of the characters (similar to what you would see in preproduction sketch books). Although it does work extremely well and seems perfectly natural in the twisted reality that is Lea Monde. All scenes are done in the same graphics engine (no CG) and there is no voice acting so all words are said in speech bubbles. Again, odd, but it works.  The game is definately quirky and is definately a bit of a niche game. It is pretty long and requires the player to really get in depth into what they are doing to truly appreciate all the work and the amazing world that has been imbedded into Vagrant Story. If you can do that, it is one of the most rewarding gaming experiences you can have. If not, then consider your self one of the masses, because that seems to be the general view of the game.	1

This game is not perfect as the Famitsu review would lead you to believe. Famitsu has only given like 5 games a perfect score... this being one of them.  The characters, design, music, story, atmosphere, and presentation are all top notch and beautiful. The story is sursprisingly mature and the characters are all memorable, especially that mystery man Sydney.  So if all of those things are so good and put together, why did this game 'ultimately' fail when it was released? Because of its gameplay.  The gameplay 'could have' been fun and classic but the makers decided to bog it down with a tremendously confusing, tedious, and unintuitive menu and weapon system.  The base of this game, its weapon system, is beyond complicated. Each weapon can be either piercing, blunt, or edged like a edged sword or a blunt hammer. Then each weapon has about 20 'affinities' such as light, water, physical, undead, etc. Then throw in the fact that each weapon must be made from seperate parts such as a blade, a grip or hilt, plus 1-3 gems. Lost yet? You should be.  But thats not all. Each weapon has damage points, kind of like health for weapons, and phantom points which inscrease special attacks. Throw in the fact that the longer you fight the more tired or excited your character gets, which leads you to miss more often and take more damage as the battle goes on.  This game does have an awesome quick menu that can be used with the L2 button. This menu lets you do anything from find items to use magic with one push of a button. However, for some reason there is no weapon quick menu in a game almost totally based around your weapons! To change weapons, and you will often, you have to make about 5 clicks through slow menus which can take anywhere from 10 secs to a minute.  This games difficult learning curve has turned away so many players without the patience to learn this games ridiculous systems. After all, hitting a boss for 1 damage, when he has 500 health, can be very frustrating, and i don't blame them.  In the end, this game is both brilliant and ridiculous. It has been voted one of the greatest games of all time and for good reason. But it also failed on a commercial and gameplay level by not selling enough copies. And thats for a good reason too...	1
While I would have agreed with most negative / melancholy reviews about this game when I originally recieved it, I must say that many years later with nothing to do I picked this game back up and inserted it.  Having beat the game the first time and now on my second playthrough (tragically my save file from the first game is long gone) I'm going to have to say that this is trully a great game.  Though I could agree that a quick menu to changing weapons would have been a nice addition, I spend sooooo much time in the menu just to customize my hero to my specs I never noticed.  This is not the standared RPG that FF7 presents nor is it anything like that of Diablo.  Born from the mistakes of Chocobo's Dungeon, Parasite eve (1&2) and ofcoarse the infamously terrible Eheirgiez Dungeon (I spelled it wrong and I don't care) This game has managed to take what was good from all those games and build off it.  While Customization abounds in this game, if you lack either the intelligence or the patience to play this game then I suggest you go back to a conventional RPG and forget you ever heard about this. While what may seem like nothing but tedious gameplay, try putting this on par of a beginers experience of D&D your first play through. (because I can gaurantee that after your first run, you'll know exactly what to expect on any upcomming situation.)	1
This game is about to get a lot of attention, more attention than it's had in the years since its Spring 2000 US release. Final Fantasy XII looms on the horizon, and it's the creative vision of Yasumi Matsuno. Vagrant Story is another of Matsuno's brainchildren. Once FFXII has been out for a couple of weeks and everybody's beaten it, a lot of those people are going to find out about Vagrant Story for the first time and go scrambling over to eBay to get a copy. This review is for them.  Almost everything about Vagrant Story is par excellance. The story, the script, the characters, the graphics, the soundtrack... The English translation is especially spectacular, due to its masterful coloring with "Olde English" which adds so much flavor to the tone and atmosphere. This is one of the ultra rare cases where the English translation is arguably far superior to the original Japanese script. Unfortunately, all of these shining examples of fine craft and "video game design as true art" is all for naught because of one single fatal flaw: The game simply isn't fun to play.  Where the game ultimately fails is in the game play. First of all, the game is extremely focused. It's all dungeon crawling and fighting. There are no towns to explore and shop in, no NPCs to talk to, no minigames. Once you enter the dungeon, that's it. You will progress through different areas and get a change in scenery from time to time, but there is almost no variety in the gameplay. You move from room to room, you solve the occasional crate puzzle, and you fight enemies. End of story.  The battle system in and of itself is fine. It's an interesting hybrid cross between standard real time action combat and traditional RPG turn based combat. The problem is, at the very heart of the battle system is an abysmally UN-fun weapon and armor system. There are several (eight?) classes of enemies in the game- Beast, Human, Dragon, Undead, Phantom, etc. The enemy classes are paired off into diametric oppositions. e.g. Using your weapon against a human enemy will make it stronger against humans, but weaker against phantoms. (sic) On top of that, there are specific weakness ratings. An enemy might be weak against blunt weapons, but almost totally impervious to edged weapons or piercing weapons. And then there are the usual elementals as well- fire, ice, earth and so on. Finally, each of your weapons has its own "wear" rating. The lower the rating, the more worn out the weapon, the less damage it does. You must repair your weapons in workshops, which are few and far between in the game. Another thing you can do in workshops is disassemble your weapons and reassemble the parts to make new weapons. Whether the new weapon will be better or worse than the weapons you sacrificed to make them involves much trial and error. The end effect of all of this is that as you play the game, you are literally constantly changing weapons. Yet the creators of the game didn't bother to implement any sort of quick menu for weapon switching, a la Secret of Mana. You have no choice but to spend 45% of your game time opening the main menu, opening the weapon menu, finding the right weapon, opening the accessory menu, changing the elemental jewels on the weapon, etc. etc. etc. All they had to do was come up with some sort of quick menu for changing weapons, as Seiken Densetsu 2 did seven years earlier. As it stands, Vagrant Story is a micro-management nightmare. To call the game tedious is an understatement of epic proportions. There are those who insist that a viable alternative is simply slogging your way through the game using whatever weapons you happen to have, whether they're effective or not. It can be done, but it makes the game even less fun. Why anyone would want to take on a boss with several thousand HP by doing only 1-3 points of damage per hit is beyond me.  As is always the case, no matter how flawed a game may be, there will be a small niche group of vocal supporters who insist that it's the greatest game ever created, and that people who don't like it just don't "get it." Beware of misguided fanatics. But hey, then again you just might end up being part of the 5% of people who play this game and come away thinking it's the bee's knees.  EDIT- Apparently the star ratings aren't displayed exactly as they were input. I gave Vagrant Story ** (2/5) for "Fun" and **** (4/5) "Overall."	1
Recently on G4 Tech TV I was watching "Filter", and they were counting down the top 10 underrated games of all time, and to my amazement and joy, Vagrant Story was rated the #1 most underrated game ever. There could be no title more worthy, and it saddens me that it has a 4 star average here on Amazon, though it's not really suprising.  Vagrant Story was one of the final Square games to come out for the PS1, and went by almost unnoticed. I didn't actually play it until it was a couple of years old. The graphics are without doubt some of the best ever seen on the PS1. I wish we could have had voice overs in this game, but such things were still pretty uncommon on the PS1. The sound is very good, light on music and heavy on creepy, atmospheric sound effects that really enhance the feeling of being lost in the huge mazes of buildings, tunnels, and dungeons.  As it is, the dialogue is absolutely exceptional, and the story is complex, twisting, and really makes you think. Good and evil end up not being quite what you think they are. The story has a heavy emphasis on a religious, crusader/inquisition type group of characters, as well as incorporating sorcery and magic. I could never explain how great the story and characters of this game are...it's just magical. The world just sucks you in.  The entire game takes place in an old abandoned ghost town on an island called Lea Monde. It is one of the most phenomenal environments ever created for a game. Much of the game takes place underground in old tunnels, vaults, caves, storage areas, and a huge variety of buried rooms, but there are also many areas where you emerge and have to explore the city aboveground. The feeling of the game is very lonely, and the old abandoned town of Lea Monde is amazing to explore.  The amount of detail that was put into this game is just incredible, and it is evident at every moment just what a labor of love it was for those who made it. Not only is the game itself exceptional, but the plethora of details they incorporated makes it an all time classic. For example, on the map screen, every single room in the game (and there are a lot) has it's own unique name. There is one dungeon where every room (and there are at least 30) is named after an implement of torture! It's just great.  There is a huge variety of enemies, and an in game encyclopedia that fills up as you encounter them. Combat is very difficult, and it seemed to me at first even too difficult, but once you get the hang of it, this game has one of the most fun, and definitely most unique, combat systems ever devised. With each swing you take, you can choose where to aim on the enemy (left or right arm, legs, body, or head!), and depending on the enemy, armor, and what type of weapon you are using, you will have a different %chance of hit and damage. There are about 6 or 7 types of weapons (blunt, piercing, slashing, etc.) and a HUGE variety of different weapons within these categories. Within this there are different gems that can be attached to your weapons to make them more efficient against certain types of enemies, give them elemental attributes, etc.  Truly, this game has an almost intimidating amount of detail, but that's what makes it so great. You can armor all parts of your body, and every single weapon and every single piece of armor is customizable by combining lesser weapons and armor in workshops that can be found among Lea Monde. Materials range from course materials like wood and iron early in the game to silver and platinum materials later. Weapons have to be created and specialized in for different creature types. For example, I usually had a spear I used against dragons, a holy mace and a holy dagger for undead and zombies, and an axe that was most effiecent against humanoid creatures. Plus, you can actually name every weapon you create, which adds an awesome finishing touch to your arsenal.  There is so much about this game that is great that I could go on for another hour and hardly scratch the surface. This game is thought provoking, its deep, and it is CHALLENGING. Not for wimps! There is so much to explore, so many hidden features, such endless customization, this game just never gets old. And, it has a new game plus feature, so you can replay it with all the skills, equipment, and magic you've acquired. Damn, I didn't even touch on the magic...there is a huge variety of magic spells you can learn as well!  I've played through it probably 3 times over the past few years, and it remains fun every time I play, and I still haven't maxed out Ashley Riots potential.  This game may not be for everyone. It is hard, confusing, and very deep. But for those of you that love fantasy games, a good story, great characters and dialogue, tons of character/equipment customization, and a big challenge, give this game a try. You can get it for cheap now, and even though it's a little dated, it may be one of your best game purchases in quite awhile.  On a final note, I'm thrilled to know that the people who are responsible for this game and for Final Fantasy Tactics are the main creative force working on Final Fantasy XII right now. It should be phenomenal! I can't wait.	1
For me this is easily the best game on playstation. Though we have moved on to the next generation of videogaming, it is hard to not go back to this game. The story is deep, the game mechanics are genius and the graphics out do all other psx games out there. This game differs from your standard rpg in sense of how the game is played. There is no leveling up, no towns to visit, or world map to explore. Also the fighting system allows you to have total control. Knowing your opponent is key to beating them. The enemy is divided into classes and you must fight according to their strengths and weaknesses. For ex. if your opponent is a dragon you will have to beat through their tough scales or find a way around them and find a weak point. The enemies aren't your average cannon fodder either. They hit and run, cast spells and play keep away. They will draw into a corner and gang up on you or get you in the open area for an ambush. With enemies that actually use brains and brawn you have to be prepared. This is where the game shines. The weapon and attack system. You start with your basic weapons and armor. As you progress you pick up better stuff and eventually be able to make new weapons and armor. Combining your old stuff you can literally make a new item. I've spent hours combining weapons and armor. Realistically as you use weapons and as your armor takes damage it loses its' strength. At the shops you can also make repairs to your inventory. The battle sysstem is tedious but fun once you get the hang of it. You draw your weapon and a sphere surrounds you. Depending on distance and SIZE of enemies and the range of your weapon you can target body parts. Taking out legs can slow and in some cases immobilize the enemy. Warning this does work both ways so protect yourself. You can cast spells on the fly by use of a quick pop up menu activated by pressing a few buttons. Also as you defeat more enemies you gain break arts, attack and defensive draws that will keep you alive in close battles. My only complaint is that this game is not for everyone. Many will get bored with the slow beginning or find the weapon system to complex to get involved. Most of all that there is no voice acting. I personally favor the text reading but most will find that outdated. In any case this game is hard to fault once you really get involved and is hard to put down. It never got the publicity it deserved, so few will tell you that they have heard of the game. But do not let that discourage you by any means. If you can find a copy get it. If you have the patients to get through the first hour for mainly learning the gameplay mechanics you will not be disappointed.	1
Square has always been known to develop quality titles and Vagrant Story proves its still one of the best in the game industry. Created by the same team who brought you Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story offers something quite different yet refreshing to the world of gaming. You are hero Ashley Riot, a Riskbreaker agent who chases the mysterious cult figure Sydney Losstarot into the city of Lea Monde. Throughout the game, you'll attempt to clear your name for being accused of murder while uncovering remnants of your past. Vagrant Story proves you don't need an overly epic storyline to make a game impressive, and this game definitely has one of the best scripts ever written for a video game.  Unlike other big-budget Square titles, which the storyline or visuals are the dominating aspects, gameplay is the star of Vagrant Story. As fair warning, this is NOT a game for casual gamers, which someone can just pick up and play. While battling, you target enemies' bodyparts with the use of a sphere grid. You'll learn to chain combos but your "risk meter" will rise, making you more vulnerable. You'll also learn to forge your own weapons and armor, do puzzle-solving and much more. The visuals are outstanding. You feel as if you really did visit Lea Monde with its dungeons and ruins. The character designs are equally amazing and the graphics push the PlayStation to its limits. Sound-wise, the music is hauntingly atmospheric and everything from the grunts and groans of monsters to the sounds of magic spells accent the game perfectly.  Although the difficulty level is a bit high and requires some patience and even frustration, it will still be an interesting but rewarding experience for anyone who really does get into it and understand the gameplay fluidly. The amount of time and effort you put into the game will determine how much fun will you have in the long run. You have to become deeply involved and immersed in order to enjoy Vagrant Story, but once you do, you'll realize you are playing one of the most unique games ever created. It's really like no other, even though it didn't receive enough recognition that it deserved. Give it a chance, it may grow on you.	1
The three draws of this game.  One helluva story revolving around intrigue--incredibly written.  Unique battle action emphasizing timing and weapon management. DEPTH. . . This word doesn't properly describe it.  This game, if you attempt to fully understand all of the management options, is almost overwhelming.  Monster type and element affinities for each individual weapon is a start to this depth.  Then the variety of weapons (anything from crossbows to swords to axes to sledge-hammers), each attuned to further damaging a few different types of enemies comes next.  Not only must you micromanage with a magnifying glass, but you must also power up a certain type of weapon for each of the six classes of monsters (can usually get away with one weapon per two classes).  This adds a strategic element to a game based in action. If you need a thinking game that doesn't fail to please, give Vagrant Story a try.  It may be your cup of tea.	1
I can't believe that I have waited THIS long to review this game.  I feel somewhat stupid actually.  I purchased Vagrant Story when it was first release because I was expecting alot out of it.  I'm sure you all will understand how great this game is when you understand that I am still playing it.  It's not as if I am playing this game all day long everyday, but because of the New Game Plus feature this game offers, I have beaten this game through and through about seventy nine, or maybe eighty times by now.  My stats are incredibly high, I can now go through the entire game with just my fists and beat down bosses and smite everything that walks.  I still need a weapon for the final boss,... But hey, that's my opinion.  Basically if you end up reading this review and havent' played this game YET, then my suggestion is to get ahold of it ASAP.  This game is one of the best square has put out in a long time.  I know that now there is FFX and some others, but still this game was way ahead of its time in the gaming community.  Play It, Buy It, or just Watch others, but do something you don't know what your missing.  Enjoy!!!	1
okay the graphics are stunning and about as good as the humble ps1 is going to get but I've got quite a few criticisms of this game so here goes: 1) Its hard to know what you're supposed to be doing half of the time so a lot of the gameplay is spent running around doing nothing. 2) The combat is ok, but it can be VERY annoying a lot of the time due to the 'affinities' of weapons and the 'risk' system. 3) Weapons and affinities are a good idea, but the way they are implemented is dreadful. I found it infuriating. 4) The weapon creation system is appaling and it is almost impossible to find a combination that does anything. And when it does there is no way of checking so it ends up just as a (bad) time wasting issue. 5) The story is okay but its hard to get a feel for the characters and get involved with the story as in mgs and ff games. Overall, I wouldn't buy this game(...).	-1
Looks like Square finally stopped paying too much attention to how the game looks and has focused on the game's story.  This game has the most well written story that I have ever seen in my decade of game-playing (which stems back to the Atari).  The dialouge is beautifully written and seems to be genuine Old English scripting.  The musicis kinda bad though.  I really didn't care for it as it sounded more like etheral background music with no real melody line, just chording.  The weapon and armor design is a nice touch too.  You can make your own weapons and armor by combining blades and armor pieces to form stronger (or in many cases weaker) weapons.  This coupled with a simple Risk system and battles become a lot of fun to try to master.  This comes even more into play with bosses.  The bosses in this game are very difficult, but their difficulty can be slashed if you have the right weapon to use against it.  The game plays very much like the game Brandish (for those with SNES).  You are Ashley Riot and arein a giant maze-like area and you hack and slash your way after the evil Sydney who has kidnapped the Duke's son.  You travel from area to area gaining treasures and defeating bosses and that pretty much is it.  I would get the game if I were a veteran RPGer who is waiting for a game with a strong story instead of a bunch of pretty pictures then get this game.	1
Quite frankly this game doesn't live up to all the hype.  I still can't believe how people say the graphics are so good since they are all completely dull dark and dreary, not to mention blockier than most SNES games I've played.  The sound is nearly non existant.  hardly any music in the game at all, just a plethora of drips squeaks squeals and puking noises.  Gameplay isn't too bad, though it isn't exactly the most fluid I've ever played, and the objects in a room tend to get in your line of sight all too frequently, no matter how you swing the camera view.  The battle system is a Parasite Eve clone thats been tuned up to the point of being almost too complicated to use.  it takes practice for certain.  The monsters are outrageously easy if you simply use hit and run tactics.  the bosses on the other hand tend to be amazingly hard if you don't know what you are doing.  Plot is relatively non existant in this game.  the opening movie pretty much gives you the basic run of the game.  the game tends to lead you around by the nose for the first hour or so and then you have a very limited number of option available for the duration of the game.  Its just another dungeon crawl.  I love Dungeons and Dragons but even that gets boring if you do nothing but one dungeon exploration after another and thats really all this game is.  the true value of the game comes from being able to find a multitude of weapons and armor and then being able to make use of various workshops to combine those items into more powerful armaments.  unfortunately this is tedious and time consuming, taking up more than 3/4 of the game.  Overall they just took a rather bland game and tried to cram in all kinds of technical stuff, taking nearly every RPG option you could think of and trying to put it all in one game.  If i wanted to spend all my time reworking weapons i'd have been a blacksmith in life.	-1
This is a really fun game, but only if you have some time on your hands.  I've been playing it for about 5 hours and I have only finished 15% of the map.  It can be kind of frustrating for people who have no patience, or people who's I.Q. only has two syllables in it.  Once you figure out the battle system, it comes along pretty well, and the fights are not really all that easy.  If you have your doubts about it, try renting it.  For most people a rental would be enough time to tell if this game is worth the money, but it isn't enough time to finish the game.	1
When I first heard that Vagrant Story was reputed to be "Medieval Gear Solid", I wasn't impressed, as I didn't care for Metal Gear Solid.  However, after hearing some more about Vagrant's storyline, and its similarities to Parasite Eve (my favorite PS game ever), I tried it out.  Result?  I have a New Favorite PS Game.  Gameplay-wise, Vagrant Story is a mixed bag:  it's too action-oriented for RPG purists, and too RPG-ish for action purists.  To me, it combines the best features of RPGs and action-adventure games, resulting in one of the most innovative, challenging, and gripping games I've ever been lucky enough to experience.  Using manga/comic-style voice bubbles was a stroke of genius -- too often voice translation RUINS games.  It's hard to believe the fading PS can produce such incredible graphics.  When the Wyvern came crashing through the ceiling at the game's beginning, my heart lept.  The "hero", Ashley Riot, is one of the most intriguing characters ever.  I was unsure until deep into the convoluted, immersive plot if Ashley's intent were for good or ill.  The story is fantastic, the characters memorable, the soundtrack and sound effects atmospheric perfection, and even the dialogue is amazing.  And the battle system....ah, the battle system.  It's a masterful blend of strategy and reflex.  First you must choose the correct weapon with the correct affinity -- doing this is half the challenge.  For example, you'd want to use a weapon with fire-based affinity against, say, a water elemental, AND you'd want to make sure your weapon has a high Phantom class ranking (an elemental is considered a Phantom class creature), in order to have a maximum chance of inflicting a maximum amount of damage.  Then, timing becomes precise as you could allegedly Chain attacks together until the end of time, although a Risk factor (which simulates tiredness during battle) makes this highly unlikely.  Ashley also has defense abilities that could, in theory, render him impervious...with the right decisions and perfect timing (and Risk allowing).  How's that for a twist?  Add to that various spells, both offensive and defensive, and Ashley is a force to be reckoned with.  Add to THAT his determined nature and hazy memory, and you have an unprecedentedly heroic character.  As you wander the dungeons beneath the city of Lea Monde in pursuit of the mysterious Sydney Losstarot, Ashley will encounter dozens of creatures:  bats to dragons, zombies to minotaurs, ogres to elementals, and enemy human soldiers, many of which are Ashley's match, physically and/or magically.  A battle I fought against a particular dragon lasted almost thirty minutes!  But Vagrant Story has more to it than a shining battle system.  The story is told through seamless cutscenes that are a Square trademark, bearing you along with revelation upon revelation.  And if that's not enough, after playing through the game, you gain access to new areas, foes, and weapons -- talk about replayability!  Vagrant Story is one of those games that demands a lot of time to experience fully, and rewards without question.  It has as much depth as any game I've ever played, both in terms of gameplay and story (plus I love the fact you can name your various weapons -- watch out for the Brain Flayer!).  Any gamer who is looking for a fresh challenge coupled with a riveting, twist-packed plot and fabulous characters should look no further than the genre-bending Vagrant Story -- a definite highlight in the outstanding PS library.	1
Vagrant Story comes to us from the same group of people who brought us the  strategy masterpiece Final Fantasy Tactics.  And like Tactics and many of  Square's other games, Vagrant Story shines with a great story and superb  gameplay. Before I get started in bringing out this game's high points,  let me bring to light its aspects that some players might view as  shortcomings.  First, know that this game is complete dungeon-crawling with  no towns to purchase equipment from and no people to converse freely with.  But unlike some games of this type, where the only real fun thing to do is  to find a rare item or encounter a boss, I found Vagrant Story's 3-D  landscapes fun to explore, and the battle system makes any enemy encounter  fun and worthwhile.  Also, to help break the monotony, there is the  occasional challenging block puzzle to solve, in which a player moves  various blocks in order to reach a certain door or treasure chest, and the  cinematic cutscenes that advance the story provide entertaining  intermissions.  Another thing to know is that it will take a few hours to  get into this game, the reason being that until you learn "Chain  Abilities," the battles seem awkward and tedious. Speaking of  battles, Vagrant Story features a fun, yet in-depth battle system.  To  start, each enemy has an enemy class.  They can be beast, human, dragon,  undead, phantom, or evil.  Each time you attack an enemy with one of your  several weapons, that weapon will grow better against that enemy's class,  while growing weaker against a different enemy class.  For example: if you  often attack wolves with your crossbow, sooner or later your crossbow will  go up a point against beasts, while decreasing a point against undead.  Also, there are six element affinities in which a weapon can accumulate  strength, and each element is strong against another.  Water extinguishes  fire, air disturbs water, earth blocks air, fire melts earth, and light and  dark cancel each other.  So, since bats are air-based, a weapon regularly  employed against these flying mammals will gradually accumulate strength in  earth, making it a better weapon to use against air enemies. Then there  are the "Chain Abilities" that I mentioned before.  At a point in  the game, your character will learn a few "Chain Abilities."  Afterwards, each battle you encounter will slowly bring him closer to  learning another.  Each "Chain Ability" has a certain effect,  such as adding 10% additional damage to an attack or healing your character  by 10% of the damage your attack inflicted.  You assign each "Chain  Ability" to a different button on your PlayStation controller, and you  execute them after your initial attack by pressing the appropriate buttons  in the proper rhythm.  So, while attacking an enemy, a player can use his  "Chain Abilities" to attack again, heal himself, and end off by  poisoning the enemy.  By pressing the appropriate buttons at the right  time, the player can have a chain of more than 20 attacks in just one  encounter with an enemy.  This makes battles much quicker. Throughout the  game, players will amass quite a collection of blades, grips, gems, armor,  and shields, which can be combined to create different and better weapons,  armor, and shields.  Combine a blade with another blade to create a more  powerful blade; snap on a grip that may make it even more powerful; place  in a gem or two to improve its attack against certain enemy classes and  elements; and behold!  You have a unique, customized weapon, and you can  even name it. With great gameplay, outstanding grpahics and animation, a  fitting soundtrack, and a good, though complex story, Vagrant Story turns  out to be one of Square's best titles and among my top ten favorites on the  Playstation.	1
This game for starters is one of the best games for Playstation. I love  the graphics, the rich textures add a lot to Lea Monde, and the speed of  play is incredible. It is truly amazing that these guys are running the PS  with a 66 or 75 mhz CPU and I not sure but I know that that is pretty  incredible. The best part of this game is that it is fit all onto one  little disk. But really that is a lot of space. Zelda:Ocarina of Time was  fit onto that 64 Megabit cart and it is pretty awesome. Want to experience  the Sixth Sense of Video games first hand? Buy this game. You will not be  sorry. I find it not only challenging but incredibly addicting. This is one  of the more interesting titles I have ever purchased. But one of the best  also.	1
I can't believe Square Soft put out a game with game play and a storyline as lame as Vagrant Story.  The battle commands are unwieldy and  time-consuming, and the dialog balloons are rather childish and  distracting.  Granted, some of the effects and characters are neat, but I  have to say the best thing about this game was the opening sequence.  After  that, it's a disappointment for experienced gamers.  I played the game for  about three hours until I couldn't stand it anymore, thinking I would get  used to it, but I just didn't like it.	-1
My son loves this game! It is easy to view, understand, and play. Wonderful graphics and sound. Really fun to play and can be used as an educational tool as well. Makes a person think! Great price and buy!	1
another good frogger game but the first frogger for ps1 is better	1
Item as described.  A pleasure to do business with! !!	1
Not as good as frogger	1
My granddaughter used to play this game when she was small.  She is now a teenager and wanted to see if she could get and use it for the PS.  She loves it, and I love it for that reason.	1
I stayed away from the first Frogger release, only because I was never a fan of the arcade version and I had read horrible magazine reviews about it.  When Frogger 2 came out, I read reviews stating that THIS is what the first Frogger SHOULD have been.  So I gave it a shot, and we loved it right away. The graphics/playfields are entertaining and FUNNY in some spots.  The control works quite nicely (a problem in the first game, I understand).  And the multi-player option is GREAT!  Jumping on your friend to slow him down, while making that "SPLAAAT!" sound never gets old. The 1-player mode is also fun and challenging.  This is definitely a game where patience is a virtue--it pays to study the mechanics of the various obstacles before you make your move! Very fun, cute, and colorful--I think most people would be happy with this game.	1
Great graphics,great control,and great sound! Each little fighter has his or her story and cute ending! This is great for kids,too,as it contains no gory bloodshed whatsoever! I rented it,loved it,and now I want to get it!	1
This is one of my favorite fighting games. I've had it for a couple of years now and I just got finished playing it a few hours ago. It's still a lot of fun. I think the reason why I like it so much is because it doesn't take anything seriously. You don't play it to become the best "Pocket Fighter" champion in the world. You play it because you want to have a good time. And the game delivers.	1
Pocket Fighter no doubt should be considered "childish" This game packs them all as with all the other Street Fighter games. The cuteness of the characters actually throw me off and I lose each time, watching it while you play is much fun. I wonder if there is a Japanimation for this game.  I love this game, it reminds me of that game called Vampire Stalkers where you have all hte fighting attributes and super combos with a wacky extra punch and kick using animals and objects. In this game they use a donkey, and a hammer, and other weird things to defeat your enemy, and like in MARVEL SUPER HEROES where you collect gems to power up, the same rule applies here as well on this game. Each time you hit your opponent gems come out and other treasures that  you must collect, but watch out not to get punched or kicked while your trying to grab the gems..  Awesome game and a collectible, don't ever sell this game, it will become a valuable collectible, and the cost value will increase.	1
Why oh why Capcom will you not stay consistent? Once again our favorite company has had a flash brilliance by taking a classic theme (Street Fighter)and adding a wonderful twist. This game is VERY addicting for any true fan of the SF genre. Bringing in characters from other titles (Darkstalkers) Pocket Fighter has a great theme. What if your favorite characters from the Capcom universe were little kids able to beat each other senseless! This game is awesome! A little cheeky with the cuteness, but it's more than made up for with hours of trying to pull off multiple hyper combos in a row! (If your as good as me.) Pocket Fighter is going to be a collectable soon so get it while you can!	1
The arcade version of Darkstalkers (Vampire Hunger/Saviour)was a great, dark fighting game with a lot of atmosphere that doesn't translate real well to the Playstation.  The variety of characters is quite good and the  game play is identical to that of other Capcom fighting titles (i.e. Street  Fighter).  The amount of characters available is what saves this game.  It  lacks the classic factor of Street Fighter, but lacks the improvements of  2D fighters like Mortal Kombat.  If you can find it cheap, it may be worth  the cost, but the quality of this game does not demand that you buy it.  Fighting game fans who want a large selection may enjoy it, but if you want  a good 2D get SF or MK or move on to the 3D's with something like Soul  Blade.	1
check out the Darkstalkers Art books that JUST CAME OUT.  Udon has done a great job with these new books.... plus, they will be out of print soon, so get yours today!	1
Darkstalkers 3 is the cream of the crop among Capcom's massive list of 2-D fighters. Marvel vs Capcom 1&2, Marvel vs X-men, Street Fighter vs Marvel, Marvel Super Heroes, etc. It dosen't matter because of one great universal rule...if you know the moves from the original SF you can play these games. What sets DS3 apart is it's upgrades in the gameing experience. Until now (if you were good enough) if could link hyper combos after knocking an opponent down. DS3 offers you the chance to not only "hit 'em while they're down", but chance to do a hyper version of that move. That's the basic theme of DS3. Classic Hollywood monsters driven by a Street Fighter engine with all the moves you know and love. The icing on this cake though is: hit 'em with a special move, a hyper special move, or a hype combo. That's why any true capcom junkie loves this title...	1
Darkstalkers 3 - Circa 1998  GOOD:  - Good Balanced 2D fighter  - An old school fighter that really stands out art style or theme wise  BAD:  - Loading times, short but still there  - Not much bonuses  - The games art style or theme is not for everyone  WILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:  - Really off the wall looking/acting fighters based on old Hollywood "B" movie monsters but with anime look and feel  - Surprisingly plays similar to Street Fighter Alpha  GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:  - Samurai Showdown 4  - Guilty Gear (original)  ADDITIONAL NOTES:  - Practicality same game on Sega Saturn and Playstion Portable  - Darkstalkers franchise has been through a few names the original was called Darkstalkers and the second was called Night Warriors  - Darkstalkers 3 has all Fighters and moves from Darkstalkers and Night Warriors	1
First I'd like to say I enjoyed this game, while not as well known as the Street Fighter series the Darkstalkers series is by far more enjoyable. The cast of charactos is diverse and the animation is much like that of the Vs. series, Wacky and over the top. The downside is it's hard to appriciate on the playstation. When compared to the first darkstalkers on playstation the charactor animation actually got worse!!! It's choppy and even upgrading the speed to turbo you can still see the painfully obvious missed frames. That said it in NO WAY compares to the Sega Saturn Night Warriors (the second in the Darkstalkers series). Sure there are more charactors and some pretty backgrounds in this, but they also suffer from poor animation!! If you have a Sega Saturn just stick with Night Warriors, if not then this is the best your gonna get. It's sad how the playstation mars the graphix of 2-D fighters like this, If you can look past the playstations downfalls this is one of the most fun fighters to date.	1
This game was good at first,but after a while it gets boring, Unlike usual fighting games that I could play hours on end. I do,however,think it was clever that they tried to mix horror and put it into a fighting game. All the characters and more are back from the arcade version, but the lack of frames compared to the arcade version will disappoint you. The main reason I got this game was because I enjoyed playing Marvel Vs. Capcom, and it had not yet come out on the Playstation. My favorite character was Morrigan,so the main reason I got this game was for Morrigan.	1
This is a great item for anyone that owns a Playstation 2.  The only decision that you have to make is whether or not to get the horizontal or the vertical stand.  I wanted the horizontal stand because that way the family pet can not knock the system over.  This also does a great job of keeping your system off of the carpet or dusty surface you may have to set your system on.  The colors and everything match the system, and for 10 bucks or so, this makes a great addition to your PS2 accessories.	1
When you see the "Vertical Stand" and "Horizontal Stand" listed next to each other, you may think that they're similar products. Don't believe it. If you stand your PS2 unit vertically, a hard jolt _could_ cause the unit to fall over, which _could_ cause damage to a disc in the drive. The vertical stand will prevent this from happening. This is A Good Thing. If you stand your PS2 unit horizontally, it will not fall over unless you pick it up and drop-kick it. (And if you do that, the stand won't do anything but injure your foot, and you'll probably void the PS2's warrantee.) A stand is _not_ necessary for a PS2 in the horizontal configuration. The Sony PS2 horizontal stand will _not_ improve your PS2's stability. It will _not_ lift your PS2 by more than an eighth of an inch or so. It will _not_ make it easier to access any of the PS2's controller ports. It will _not_ significantly improve the PS2's cooling. In short, the PS2 horizontal stand has no practical use whatsoever. So is it a completely pointless product? Not quite. If you look at the picture, you'll notice a raised blue strip at the front of the stand. When you install the horizontal stand, this raised blue strip covers the bottom half-inch or so of the PS2 (at least the parts of it not used by the ports). In my opinion, this _does_ make the PS2 look marginally better (though it looks perfectly reasonable on its own). So if you're looking to make a minor fashion statement for your PS2, then by all means, buy the horizontal stand. Just don't expect it to be anything more than that.	-1
According to Sony, when the PlayStation 2 was first designed, it included the blue bar that comes with the horizontal stand. For whatever reason, they decided to remove this feature. Maybe to get to get us to dish out another 10 bucks, but most likely because while it looks cool in the horizontal position, the blue bar would look pretty bad when the PS2 is used in the vertical position. Asides from that, the horizontal stand is completely useless. It does not add any extra stability to the unit, and when you pick up the PS2 to move it you must move the stand too, they do not become attached. If I were you, (and I did the same thing), I would put the 10 bucks towards a vertical stand, which is both cool looking and useful.	-1
You cannot guess how many places I went to just to buy this game! Every place I went to was SOLD OUT! It took me several weeks until I finally  located one. Now I can understand why this game is so hot. The game is  great! The graphics and the motion of the characters are superb. It gives  you 3 game modes, (1)Arcade-which is just like the coin-op arcade version,  which I never get to play because there's always someone on it,  (2)Exhibition-which is similar to Arcade, but you can change the different  settings and (3)World Circuit-which is like a season mode where you start  off ranked #300 and have to work your way up by challanging other players.  You also have to earn money to unlock secret characters, clothing, new  strings and others. What's cool about the World Circuit is that it has  these mini-type games (similar to what Crazy Taxi has). The biggest  disappointment is that it has real tennis players, but NO SUPERSTARS such  as Agassi & Sampras. They could have at least made a "create a  player" mode. Overall the game is simple. The buttons are easy to  remember, no need to read the instructions. Also, the overall menu  operation isn't complicated at all. Just think of it as PONG with  outstanding graphics!	1
What an amazing game.  The graphics are amazing.  The controls are sooo simple and the gameplay is fantastic.  Even if you are not a huge tennis  fan, I'm am sure you will have fun playing it with your friends.  I like  everything about it except for a few MINOR things.  One:  No Agassi,  Sampras or Rafter?  Two:  The players dive too much.  Thats about it.  A  great game.	1
I've been playing tennis for years, and I can say without a doubt that Virtua Tennis is the best tennis game on any system, bar none.  The  gameplay is simple yet effective, the graphics are astounding and the  control is (for the most part) spot on. You will have hours of fun playing  this game. But prepare yourself, for this is one of those  "easy-to-play-yet-incredibly-hard-to-master" games.  On the World  Circuit mode, for example, you'll breeze through all of the level one  matches.  However, the level two challenges will teach you a lesson in  respect, believe me.  You'll need to hone all of your skills to master this  game.  To that end, there are several training mini-games such as bowling  (where you serve to knock over bowling pins) and cannon ball  (where you  hit balls from ball machines, trying to hit them).  I found a few of these  frustrating, as most of them are timed and the winning requirements are  very strict.  Plus, these games also level up as you beat them.  However,  stick with it, and you will prevail. There's a few bad points to the title.  For example, be prepared to hear the same three sounds when your racquet  hits the ball.  Also, there's not much speech in the game.  Announcers and  grunts...that's about it.  But, those are mainly just nits. My biggest  gripe is with the animation.  Visually, it's stunning.  But, once your  player begins an animation, he will follow that animation to completion,  even as the ball zips by.  This resulted in several missed shots for me.  All in all, if you're a tennis player, fan or just a casual observer, you  must buy this game.  It's that good.	1
Out of all the sport games I have for the Dreamcast system, this has got to be the best. The graphics are the tighest and game play is butta. All  the moves all the serves, backhands, forhands, slap shots, trickshots and  much more. This game had me and four other friends up to 3am battling for  bragging rights. NBA2k has to take a back seat to Virtua Tennis, but only  until MLB2k1 is released at the end of this month. For tennis lovers and  all around video game sport lovers like myself, this game is a must have.  The price is right and well worth it. oNe	1
"Very fun but very frustrating"  Virtua Tennis is a simple and fun tennis game that anyone can pick up and play. However, there are two major problems with the game. They are the computer AI and the overly difficult challenges near the end of the game.  Gameplay: 7  Virtua Tennis has three different modes of play in which you can play both singles and doubles matches. In Arcade mode you basically play five tennis games. If you want to move on to the next opponent you must beat the current one. If you lose one match you are eliminated. In the Exhibition mode you just play one game with the players and court of your choosing. In the World Circuit mode you must travel the world and play matches of increasing difficulty. There are also training stages. In these you must do things like knock bowling pins down and smash boxes off of the court.  There are only two buttons in Virtua Tennis. The A button button is a regular shot and the B button is a lob shot. Lobbing hardly ever works. About 90% of the time you try a lob shot your opponent will smash an impossibly hard to hit shot back in your face. You can also dive for the ball. This almost never works. If you are lucky enough to be able to hit the ball when you dive it will usually go out or leave a very easy shot for your opponent.  At first there are eight players to choose from. By playing through the World Circuit you can unlock eight more. Each of them have their own strengths and weaknesses. While some of the players, like Tim Henman and Mark Philippoussis, are fairly well known, none of them are huge superstars. I really don't care about that though.  There are also ten courts to choose from. There are four different court surfaces that play quite differently. This is a very nice feature because your strategy slightly changes depending on what surface you are playing on.  Virtua Tennis can be very addictive. It is easy to sit down and spend many hours with this game. I found it hard to put down the controller after playing.  One flaw in the game is the computer AI. When you are playing the computer it seems like most of the time they have a pattern. Whatever side of the court you hit the ball from the computer usually hits it to the other side. I frequently found myself sprinting to the other side of the court before the computer player would even hit the ball. Your computer partner in doubles is even worse. He simply doesn't do his job. I have felt like throwing the controller through my TV screen many times because my partner would just stand there and let the ball pass him. The computer will also sometimes lunge into your side of the court to hit the ball.  Another thing I don't like about the game is how absurdly hard it is to get some of the special outfits. I have spent about five hours trying to get one of them but I still have not been able to do it. It's so frustrating it has actually given me a headache before.  Graphics: 8  Overall the graphics in Virtua Tennis are good. The courts are incredibly realistic looking and the players are pretty well done even though their reactions repeat frequently. The audience looks very bad when you see them up close. The backgrounds don't look very good either. The court looks so good that you probably won't often notice these things.  Music and Sound: 5  The music in Virtua Tennis is awful. You hear the same terrible rock music constantly while you play. It seems like it is the same music playing over and over again.  The sound is better. The noise the ball makes when it is hit sounds realistic. Each player makes a different sounding grunt. The announcer does nothing but announce the score after every point. Luckily there are no commentators.  Length: 6  The length of the game is fairly short. The World Circuit should probably take a few days to complete and the Arcade mode can be beaten in less than ten minutes.  Replay Value: 9  The game is so fun that it can be played over and over again without getting boring. I have played the World Circuit through twice and enjoyed it both times. It might start to get a little easy after a while though.  Overall: 7  Virtua Tennis is a good game with a few faults. It is definitely worth the price it now has.	1
I have to admit I was rather surprised i liked this game. When my brother gave me his Dreamcast, this was one of the games he gave me along with it. I'm not a fan of watching tennis, and I can't play worth anything. But the game turned out to be fun. Like most of the Dreamcast sports games, it isn't too difficult for a player like me (one who doesn't play all the time and isn't a phenomenal player). The graphics are nice, and game play is easy to figure out and really works well. There is a save option and the game turns out to be quite fun. I say yes if you are asking whether or not to pick up this game.	1
I give this game 4 stars because its a great game the best on any system until Tennis 2K2 In this game you cant do much but what can be done is great This is very realistic tennis gameplay ecsept for the ball speed which is kind of slow and the players are people you've never heard of If your looking for a better game get Tennis 2K2	1
I am not a tennis fan at all but when it comes to this game, I am always up for some Virtua Tennis. The career mode is pretty good. Win matches to get money so you can buy players, levels and wears that can later be used in normal and multiplayer mode. The multiplayer is the best! It is a four player game that is always fun to play. This is always an alternative for multiplayer. Get this game if you have a big family! IT IS DEFINATELY WORTH THE PRICE!!! I hope that this review was helpful to you!	1
Okay, I hate watching tennis, I don't mind playing it, and tennis games usually put me to sleep. I played the arcade version at a local arcade and it really surprised me. I just had to get it. It is really addicting and the world circuit is really fun. You do fun trainings like crashing pins and targets and you have a partner. You can save money and buy characters for the arcade version. This game is awesome! GET IT NOW!	1
Overall the game is great nice graphics and sound.  The downside to this game is that you only play with two buttons.  Another con is that the play is unrealistic.  You can dominate a point from no man's land and can't hit topspin, slice, or anything like that.  Although the gameplay is unrealistic, I'm a tennis addict in RL, I still find myself paying again and again.  Great game overall.	1
I'm not really a tennis fan, but I still enjoyed this game.  Virtua Tennis is great because almost anyone can pick up a Dreamcast controller and start to play this game with some degree of skill.  Virtua Tennis isn't too deep as far as gameplay is concerned, but should still please most gamers.  This game really shines when taking on a friend in a match or doing a small tournament amoungst a group of friends.  The only downside to this game is that it might be a little too arcadish for a serious fan of tennis to enjoy.	1
Who would have thought that a Tennis game would be this amazing? Addictive and fun at the same time, Great graphics and a great selection of top tennis players of today give this game an authentic feel.  A deep professional mode gives you hours and hours of non stop fun.  The game all around is top notch and a must have for any gammer especially sports fanatics.	1
This is the best tennis game ever. The graphics are amazing and the game has so much to do. If you hand didn't get tired from banging the ball back an forth you'd never be able to quit this game. It's fun for parties, it's fun for small get togthers, it's even fun if you're all alone. If you are into Tennis get this game, even if you hate tennis this game will make you like it. You will play this game until you're hand losses oxygen. This is a must have to add to the sega sports collection, which is the best thing on the DC. Go Sega Sports!!!	1
Not many tennis games keep me interested for long, but this isn't the case with the addictive play in VIRTUA TENNIS. The graphics are stunning as players look lifelike and the courts truly look as though you're playing at Wimbeldon or the French Open. The gameplay is simple, but also presents a challenge to master, especially in heated two-player matches. The two-player singles matches seem to always be competitive with several games coming to deuces. The world circuit mode isn't as difficult as some here have said, but it has kept me busy with the many levels and training modes that must be completed. I'm not sure why Sega chose not to include women, but it surely was a mistake. Actually, I think more people recognize Davenport, Hingis, Seles, and the Williams sisters than they do the men, besides of course Sampras and Aggasi who are absent in this game. A deeper world circuit mode, more options, and obviously more players would have helped make this game better, but overall there's not a better tennis game available. This game puts WORLD SERIES BASEBALL 2K1, which was released around the same time with more hype, to shame. I can't wait for the sequel to VIRTUA TENNIS	1
If you are a tennis lover, you know how important it is to play tennis as it is meant to be played - fast, hard, with skill, and with smarts.  Virtua tennis offers all these features but also offers wonderful graphics, fantastic sound, numerous players to choose from, several levels, many courts and types, and a training area with couch.  This is a must have for all video gamers who like tennis.	1
Sorry about that title, tennis fans, but I don't really get into the sport all that much.  I think it's kinda dull, personally.  Not after playing Virtua Tennis, however.  Why should you like this game?  Here are a few reasons. First, a backstory:  I heard this game ruled on about 19 different levels, so I was curious when I picked it up.  I figured, at worst, I'd just sell it back.  I'd seen it in the arcade and figured there wasn't much to it.  That's not true and true at the same time. The game is REALLY easy to get into.  Once you figure out the play controls, you'll be overhead-smashing like the rest of them, but it doesn't end there.  It's so deep, so intricate as far as shot position and hitting the ball, that you get a rush after a series of volleys and that drop shot makes it past your opponent.  It makes you look into what shot you'll need for what surface:  Some shots (and movements) aren't the same on turf as they are on clay, on grass, etc.  THAT'S what makes a sport game awesome:  When you can play it, not knowing much about the sport, and getting really into it at the end (the NHL series on Genesis was like that). There's a lot of gameplay here, as there are a number of characters to unlock, as well as a few challenging (and fun) minigames.  The minigames are pretty cool and original...using your tennis skills to knock down bowling pins, dropping shots in trash cans, playing Hollywood Squares without the washed-up celebrities or Whoopi....it's really cool. The main reason why I like this game is this:  I have a 7-year-old nephew, and whenever he comes over he makes a beeline straight to my DC.  He's been playing it recently, and he really likes it.  That's why I like it as well:  It's easy to get into (anyone can do it), hard to put down, and it'll keep your guests entertained for hours.  If you like sports games, looking for a party game (4 PLAYER ACTION!!  WHOO-HOO!!!), or something that's not along the same vein as the Resident Evils, Mortal Kombats or other fighting games, pick this one up.  It's easy, fun, and you'll feel unbeatable after conquering one of the harder minigames. As for selling it back, well, get your own, fanboy....	1
This has got to be the best tennis game that i have ever played.  The game is so easy to get into, the controls are nice and easy to get to grips with.  The graphics are quite good on this game, and possibly thr best i have seen on a sports game for some time.  The playability fot this game is great you won't be able to put it down especially when you play against your friends.	1
I am NOT an avid tennis fan. That being said, anyone who owns a Dreamcast NEEDS to buy this game! The graphics are stellar, it looks like a televised  broadcast. The difficulty is adjustible so that tennis impaired people like  myself can still compete. Sure, the big names are missing and there are no  female players but that's the only gripe I have. Singles tests your ability  to read the other player's style and adjust. Doubles is great as you not  only have to recognize the opponents' tendencies but also your partner's as  well. And finally, there are MANY training sessions that not only help you  hone your skills but are just plain FUN! In fact, I found the bowling pin  training session to be so much fun I play it over and over just for fun.  This game has it all. Strategy, coordination, technique, practice and  training. Its actually quite addictive. I find myself losing a match and  screaming at the TV while adjusting my strategy and when I finally beat  him...I yell in victory!  Yeah, my roommates are growing tired of my  yelling and cheering but it is the most fun I've had with the dreamcast in  awhile.	1
Shouldn't Sony be focusing on the PS2?  Since they are diverting their resources to the PSTwo, the PS2 must be throwing in the towel.	-1
I loved the size of the new PSTwo, but it is still overpriced.  You can buy an Xbox for this price.  Even though the Xbox is larger, it has a more powerful processor and comes with a harddrive so you don't need to shell out even more money for memory cards such as playstations require.  True playstation has a larger number of games, but xbox has many high quality games coming out in the next few months.  Such as Fable, Halo 2, MechAssault 2: Lone wolf ect.  Pros. 1. Small size and portable 2. Large game selection from PS1 and PS2 titles  Cons. 1. Priced as much as an Xbox (When this hits $100 dollars next year I will be first in line to buy it.) 2. Games graphically challenged compared to xbox 3. More money for memory cards including special memory cards for PS1 game saves.  Sony,take a hint and reduce the price of PSTwo or bundle it with memory cards, two controllers, and a game for this price.	-1
The Playstation 2 has been out in the USA for four years now, and has gone through a number of subtle redesigns, but none as dramatic as this.  This new PSTwo is remarkably tiny, and you almost need to hold it in your hand to appreciate just how much Sony reduced the size of the machine.  The design feels a lot like a laptop computer -- especially the top-loading optical drive -- and is doubtless cheaper for Sony to produce.  This time I feel that we the consumers get a slick product in return for the company's increased profits.  It's delicate, but no more so than the original PS2.  There are no major compromises in this machine: like the previous design, it has two memory card slots, two controller ports, two USB slots, a progressive scan DVD player, a built-in infrared remote receiver (for controlling and watching DVD movies), and the AV outputs as the original PS2.  Optional video cables can change the signal from the default component to S-Video or composite, just as before.  An optical audio jack is also present for digital sound output.  What's missing?  Not much.  The Firewire port of the launch PS2 has long been abandoned, and is also absent here.  You will need to use a new multi-tap if you want to play one of the few games that support more than 2 simultaneous controllers.  You'll also be unable to plug in the "PS2 HDD," the hard disk drive albatross that will likely never be supported by Sony again outside of the online Final Fantasy game.  No great loss there.  As a DVD player, the new PS2 is at least as good as any other lowend machine that does progressive scan and has DTS and Dolby audio and digital output.  I'm using it paired with an official Sony remote and plan to return the cheapo machine I bought when my old DVD player wouldn't change layers on the new Star Wars set properly.  My new PS2 not only performs just as well, it also plays hundreds and hundreds of games for both Playstation 2 and the original Playstation. It also plays DVD-R movies, though not MP3 CDs or VCDs.  The machine has a built-in modem and Ethernet port for online play.  There is no additional cost for most PS2 online games, but in my opinion Sony's online implementation is not nearly as easy or smooth as that of the XBOX.  Even after this redesign, the PS2 is still the "weakest" of the current game consoles (compared to Microsoft's XBOX, Nintendo's GameCube) in terms of graphical power, and despite this new design, is still the most expensive since you will need to purchase an 8MB Playstation 2 memory card in order to save your games and settings.  Nevertheless, it's a great system even if you already own one of the competitors, because of the large software library with many exclusives and lots of quirky Japanese titles.  The new design is cool enough to even warrant getting a second PS2 system even if you already own the original.  If you don't have a current-generation video game system yet, and you want one, this would be a good one to start you off.  The PS3, when released, is likely to be little more than an evolution of the types of games represented on this system.  There's a huge number of excellent low-cost games on this platform, with something for almost everyone who loves games.	1
Certainly a space saver, this a great unit if you have a small area or running out of room on your a/v rack.  Top loading is a plus since it eliminates the need for moving parts.  Also an integrated 10/100 Ethernet ports and IR for the DVD remote.  The minus is the HDD.  But only few games are able to run to a hard drive.  But all the retail stores have this unit already, why is Amazon.com releasing this product Oct. 31?  As for overheating, which was common in the older units, will return is only issue I'm concerned about.	1
doesn't read discs very well	-1
This has been so far a great investment. It has been working perfectly and I have not had any problems so far. I got it for a good price too.	1
Great system and works well! Can't play ps1 games on it, but i'm not too worried about it. I mainly bought it for ps2 games. I would recommend!	1
Works great. For my grandson when he comes over. He enjoys it.	1
My little girl loves this game, it has a good story to it and keeps kid's attention for a while. True to Winnie the Pooh there is no voilence and just wholesome fun. Well worth it for a 4 years old that like Pooh bear.	1
Although signficantly easier, this is where the Spyro games should be heading: More character interaction, minimovies, and a beautiful 3D world. The game is straightforward -- Tigger looks for honey pots along with miniquests given to him by his friends -- avoiding woozles, hephalumps, spooky trees, water, crows, bats and prickly thorns along the way. My only beef with the game is the baffling lack of instructions -- what's the timer for? How come we finished and are only 61% done? Still, little kids (the target audience) won't mind a bit and parents can, I suppose, look in a hint book for the answers ... there is a hint book, right?	1
Thanks	1
A+ packaged carefully. In good condition. You can't go wrong with the 7000 series model of PS2 as far as slim models go, pretty reliable.	1
Works fine, just a tad bit dirty with some scuffs.	1
Everything ok	1
Thanks	1
Came with 2 of everything in original packaging and was an amazing price.	1
also....I forgot...the controller didn't work so I had to order another one	1
Nice	1
Great replacement	1
I got it on stand by, checked it out, works perfectly well, thank you very much!	1
I checked out the system, it's in very good condition, works really well, thank you!	1
IT ARRIVE ON TIME IT WAS BRAND NEW NO PROBLEM AT ALL	1
This was bought for my son, but he loves the system. Arrived on time as stated and was in excellent shape.	1
Playstation 2 is one of the greatest systems of all time.	1
normal	1
Nice machine.  Great design adjustments.	1
Great product. [:	1
This is a great game system! My boys LOVE it! They play all day on it!	1
works good	1
The product performs as expected. The supplier is excellent. Would recommend purchasing from them if they have a product you need.	1
excelente	1
I love this console cause it can play both the PlayStation 1 & 2 games, plus it is slim and fits well under my stand. I like the way the controller is made it fits my hand perfect and I can reach all the controls on it easily, unlike other controllers that are to big and bulky.	1
It came with everything that was promised.  The system was in very good condition including the game. The packaging and shipping was excellent.  My granddaughter loves it.	1
What I like about this Playstation is the need for the bulky external power supply has been eliminated. The power cord plugs into the console directly to avoid excessive clutter. I use my AV/component video cable I bought from Game Stop to get the best picture because the one that came with the unit doesn't always produce the brightest image. I've had good luck with it so far in other respects as far as game performance, memory card and controller functionality. For those who still have Playstation 2 or DVD game software and need to replace their old console, this one will work well enough.	1
this item is just what i wanted.all was good nothing missing or broken. so far its working great. im really amazed you can still find these new!!!!!,	1
i have had loads of trouble with this device,  first off the fan unit plug was not correctly attaced and the plug leading to the bord was busted so i had to get out my soddering gun and permanently attach the wires to the bord, i have to have a larg fan running on it at all times or it overheats and shuts down even with the fan working (thow i think it has more to do with the power suply then the Ps2 (a cheep aftermarket one that came with it.) i had to take a laser mounting tray (the moter and rotater) from another ps2 because the one it came with is no longer working for some reason.  how ever it works great other then that and being a huge computer/game console geek  i enjoy trouble shooting and repareing it just as mutch as i love working on computers so, it may be a lose/lose but at the same time its a win/win	1
I love this game you buy cars and monafiy to make them go faster the tracks are fun and well done	1
this game is so badd i don't even want to talk about it one thing to say is the car control is horrible. whats a racing game with no car control. sega how could you let this one out of the door. AAAAAARRRRRRRHHHHHHGGGGGG!!!!!!!	-1
This prouduct was great no problem I would buy again.  I loved it, it arived early it was more then what I expected.	1
OK, first thing's first: if you want a racing game that you can just throw into your Dreamcast and play for a short time every now and then, you'd be better off going for something like Ferrari F355 Challenge or Rush 2049. This game is very involving, and you must expect to spend a long time working your way through it if you want to be successful. While casual gamers are treated to 'quick race' and 'time attack' modes, the bulk of the game lies in the championship mode, which requires a lot of time and effort to conquer. Buying the game just for it's 'single race' mode is like buying a Ferrari just for the comfy seats! You start off with a little amount of money, then you gradually earn money and cars by winning races and special challenges. You might assume that the game doesn't get interesting until you've acquired the Dodge Viper and souped it up, but this is not the case. The fast cars are almost impossible to control on the very difficult courses, so you would be better to use a slightly less powerful car. Of course there are fast tracks where you can be a speed demon, so choosing the right car for the track is important. There are four classes of car based on their engine displacement: Extra, B, A and SA class. At the start of the game you will have to pass tests to earn each license. There are about 24 license tests, all from different manufacturers; if you can beat the current record for each license track, you will win a special 'works car' from that manufacturer. However, you are as likely to win all of these as you are to land on the moon tomorrow. The license tests are easy to pass, but to win the works cars is near-impossible, and will take you a LONG time. This isn't a negative aspect mind you, I enjoy the fact that the game offers so much to do and will keep you playing for months. If you win every race/challenge in the championship mode (of which there are a lot) you will unlock a new mode called 'world speed king'. I can't say much about this though, as I'm a LONG way from seeing it! The control in the game is superb; each one of the 130+ cars handle just as you would expect them to, and tweaking them in the garage makes a noticable difference to the way they perform. Arcade-style-racing fans will find the controls far too twitchy and unstable; this is definitely aimed at simulation fans although the controls can be configured to suit your liking, including steering sensitivity. I have used both the Dreamcast controller and the Madcatz MC2 Racing Wheel, and both worked excellently. For the ultimate experience however, I have got to recommend the racing wheel and pedals - you won't believe how realistically at handles the cars. Although you probably can get through the game without too much mechanical tweaking, you will find it much easier to invest a little time in learning what you need to do to improve your performance. Practically EVERYTHING is adjustable and replaceable, from the wheel base distance to the gear ratios, and you can buy plenty of parts, from $2,600 aluminium hubcaps to $80,000 turbo engine makeovers. Unfortunately there is no online multiplayer option, but you can play with two players using a split screen. You can also connect to the internet to get tips from the Sega GT website (which is, unfortunately, rarely updated) and also register your best lap times - however, don't expect to see your name at the top unless you are prepared to lose all your spare time trying to shave off 2 seconds from your already perfect lap! The graphics are beautiful, there is hardly any draw-in and the frame rate never slows down. The cars are stunningly rendered. Cars are offered from the usual predictable manufacturers, including Toyota, Dodge, Ford, Honda and Mazda. The selection of cars is more than sufficient; I have heard people complain that there aren't enough, but trust me, 130 is plenty. Especially since you can build your own from scratch, and this is where the game gets really interesting. The 'Carrozerria' allows you to build your very own car however you want it, with 2 million different combinations possible. At first you can only build E-Class cars (with a displacement less than 1000cc). To build better and faster cars you will have to pass a series of tough tests in the car you have made. Persevere long enough and you can soon be building 5000cc, 3000hp (yes, you read right) monsters. You will have to build your own cars to enter some of the races in the championship mode, most of which have restrictions on what you can race in. Build as many cars as you like, and if they turn out to be substandard, well then you can always sell them to some sucker in the 'car dealer' option as a 'limited edition concept car'. ;-)  Each car does handle differently depending on how you choose to build it and modify it, and it will take a lot of experimentation for you to get it just right. You can save your cars onto your VMU to rave your friends, which is a nice feature. The game also offers a mini-game for the VMU (which takes up 128 blocks), and you can earn cash and unlock special cars for use in the main game, though if you aren't interested in that then you won't be at a disadvantage. Still, it's a nice little bonus to keep you occupied while you're away from the Dreamcast. The main game uses 42 blocks for its save game file. The biggest drawback about this game is its lack of any damage modeling whatsoever. So, when you crash your brand new Dodge Viper head-on into a wall at 250mph, you won't even scratch the paintwork. You can just carry on as if nothing happened, with just a little rumble on the jump pack to indicate you hit something. This can distract you from the realness of the game very quickly, and that is something no game should do. Given the sheer depth of gameplay though, it is just about forgivable. It would also have been nice to be able to race more than just 5 other cars, but you can't have it all... The menu interface is quite clumsy and can quickly get tedious, but you just have to put up with it. By the way, if you select the 'Internet' option from the main menu, PLEASE remember to save your game beforehand or you lose everything you've done in the previous session. Unfortunately the manual has no mention of this - I learned the hard way! Generally, this is one of the best racers available for the Dreamcast and if you are someone who likes to get really involved in a game then you will love this. However, others need not apply. I would give this 4 and a half stars, but since it is so damn impressive in most respects I'll bump it up to a 5....	1
Its about time that the dreamcast had a decent driving game, and its more or less a rip of of Gran Turismo, and i don't mean that in a bad way.  The graphics are good the game play is excellant, i haven't been able to stop playing it since i purchased it.  You have to get licences the same as in Gran Turismo so if you have played it you will be familiar with the concept of the game.  This is the closest the dreamcat will ever get to a Gran Turismo and i think its a job well done	1
Sega GT is a beautiful game.  If you don't own a Playstation, and have never tried Gran Turismo, you should definitely get this game and see what the fuss is about.  Sega GT is a Gran Turismo clone, but it is a good clone, and feature for feature, they are mostly equal.  You still race real street cars on GT tracks, slowly building up your funds and buying more exotic cars.  The gameplay style is fun but realistic.  If you own and love Sony GT, then Sega GT will defintely get you excited about the genre again. So how does Sega GT compare with Gran Turismo?  It's a mixed bag overall -these games are neck in neck for every single feature- but I still prefer Sony GT.  Gran Turismo is has more cars, more tracks, and a better training/liscense mode.  The analog stick on the Dualshock is easier to use, although the physics are practically the same.  If you've just spent 200 hours playing Sony GT, then Sega GT will certainly seem foriegn to you.  The tracks also seem more fun to drive, and GT2 has rally racing, so its like getting Sega GT and Sega Rally in one game.  Finally, there is more soul in Gran Turismo - you can really tell that the developers love cars. Still, Sega GT holds its own in many ways.  While the individual tracks aren't as inspiring, they certainly hold their own, and overall there is a more even progression from long fast courses to tight twisters.  If you like a certain style of driving, you will find more examples of it in Sega GT than in Sony GT.  The graphics are bright and clear, a pleasure to look at, and you can see farther ahead on the track, meaning your driving can be a smug more realistic.  While the analog stick isn't as nice on the Dreamcast controller, the 2 analog triggers are perfect for breaking and acceleration.  It really is the best gamepad overall for a race game. Sega GT adds some needed realism with car collisions.  In Gran Turismo, the cars hardly respond at all when you collide with another one, and I could often come screaming into the inside of a curve and slam into another car, using it for "braking" and thus passing it with extra speed.  Sega GT can cause spins and severe loss of speed when you collide, so making your way through a pack of cars is very intense, and can take the entire race.  Qualifying is now necessary.  In essense, it's a whole new game. Also, Sega GT added a "create-a-car" model, where you build a vehicle from the chassis up.  The bodies are usually based on real cars, so don't expect huge visual leaps forward.  However, these new cars are often completely untuned.  I found I could get great improvements out of the custom cars by tweaking and experiementing with camber settings, gear ratios, etc.  In most normal street cars, the settings are usually set at their optimal level, so this adds another great level to the game for me.  Unfortunately, there is no indepth tutorials on this aspect, but no game yet provides this detail, so it's not required. Get this game.  Like Gran Turismo, Sega GT is a most own.  The differences are negligable, but the fun is not.	1
The ps2 slim is better than the original in that it operates a little faster, it's more space efficient, and it has the upgrades, such as the IR port for remote control access, and all that. It seems a little frail if standing on its side with a stand, but there are other aftermarket stands for horizontal and verticle that make it more sturdy. I used wireless controllers, so I didn't worry about cords pulling the unit off the stand.	1
I had sold my PS2 a few years back to afford to buy the PS3. I decided that I wanted to put a PS2 in my car so I purchased this one. It works perfect and looks great on my car's tv screen.	1
I've played video games since the Nintendo Entertainment System sat in my family's living room. Since then there have been several ones that stand out and the PS2 is one of them. This is one of those systems that you just never get rid of because some of the games were just so awesome. Like the "Need for Speed" games not to mention God of War and Final Fantasy X. Sqaured away system.	1
I really haven't found a need to purchase the Wii, PS3, or X-Box 360, because the PS2 still has an enormous library of games that I still haven't gotten to.  This slimmed down version of the PS2 surprised me by how lightweight and small it was. The external power supply was wonderful, especially being dual-voltage. It's easy to slip into a backpack and takes up remarkly little space in your entertainment center.  I have heard of instances of overheating, but I have left the slim PS2 running for almost 24 hours before and it never degraded in performance, much less overheated. Perhaps this was true in an earlier model, but not this one.  If the sales are any indication, there's much more mileage left on this system, and more than enough games out there (and CHEAP!) to keep you occupied. I'm not going to bash the next generation systems, but the PS2 still works wonderfully for me, and I don't feel like I need anything better (relatively speaking) right now.	1
I got this for a whopping $99 at target and have spent hours playing guitar hero with it.  Pro's. Small form factor (can put it in a backpack)  Con's. Small form factor.. They should have put the memory slots BELOW the controller slots for easy access.	1
Durable, fun ps2 just as advertised. Stands up to 24 hour continuous teenager abuse. A+ all the way.	1
The PS2 is an awesome console. If you own the Wii or Xbox 360 get the PS2 because it still has cool games. The PS2 has awesome video games like God of War 2,Star Wars Battlefront 2,and the EYE TOY. I also like it because you can download your data from your PS2 to your PSP. Just a great old console. ENOUGH SAID!!!	1
***The ratings contained in this review are not my own personal ratings but are intended to best aid a beginner or novice in the gaming world***  I am what you may call a gamer aficionado. I have been around since the NES release and have played them all including back dating myself to the Atari 2600. This review is intended to clarify some points for the more casual gamer, and will cover this and last generation of consoles by maker.  Nintendo - The first in my list because this is the first you will recognize. And we will start off with last generation, the Gamecube. Gamecube was intended for children. And let it be known that it didn't disappoint. Gamecube has released some very solid titles, including Metroid, Mario, Zelda, and Smash Brothers. I know there are going to be comments made about this, but remember, this is for the casual gamer and the casual gamer will enjoy and appreciate the quirkiness of Smash Bros. without noticing the minor flaws. So back to the review. The Gamecube has maintained solid four-player gaming and has re-released a few titles (Zelda: Ocarina of Time) that will make it well worth the purchase. Not to mention the Gameboy Advance interface (Especially for you Pokemon fans) and the price. The Gamecube is by far the cheapest "new" console on market. But the Wii, in addition to being the cheapest new generation (I refuse to call them next-gen anymore) will also play all the old Gamecube games (A feat X-Box missed the mark on). And for those of you who knew that your parents grew up on NES or just really want to know what 16-bit gaming was all about, the Wii includes an internet feature which will allow you to download all the classics you missed out on (read as They will charge you to play classic Nintendo games). There is a one time fee involved, so don't fret too much (although it's a little high for someone also shelling out around $50 a game for other consoles as well). The Wii is fun and innovative, and if you want to feel more involved in the game, Nintendo nailed it. The new controllers are completely motion sensitive without losing the function of an analog stick. The button systems are intuitive although a little frustrating (i.e. you point the controller just off the screen when trying to aim). Nintendo did a great job growing up. The Bad - Although the cheapest in the bunch it is also the most difficult to find. I got lucky and bought mine just when it was added online. You'll probably have to ask when a store gets shipments in and trail the truck in from the freeway. Also, although the Wii plays all old titles, you'll still have to purchase "old" controllers to play them. The online is fun as well. Mii's alone are worth it. BUT, the store will frequently freeze unless your wireless internet is set up just right. (There is a connection for wired internet, but what do you need that for if the Wii has a wireless modem built in?) The verdict - All in all, you'll be incredibly happy with a Wii and for a Casual Gamer you may not need anything else. All things considered: 5 out of 5 for the casual gamer. The joy of playing this fun console, the price and Wii Sports which comes included with the console far out-weigh the inaccuracies and glitches held within the controller and the fact that this little thing only produces picture in regular definition, not High-Definition..  X-Box - Microsoft threw it down when they teamed up with Sega to create what they hoped would be (and may still become) the ultimate gaming console. The original X-Box was created to be very much a devoted computer: devoted to gaming. There were even computer mod chips readily available to enhance your playing experience and the hard drive was upgradeable. Granted the casual gamer would need a friend to do the changes and probably wouldn't even know the difference (except for the interface) unless that same friend pointed it out. Now this is a new system put out by a "new" company, so there is no backwards compatibility (you can't play any old games). The controller is probably the most comfortable (in my opinion) and the games are mostly nice to look at. There are some moments (Halo) when you'll even find yourself standing still in the game to stare at the scenery. Being a new system make sure you at least get Version 2 (I had a V 1 that heated up very quickly, but I kept the V 1 controller for my own comfort... it's bigger, my hands are big... enough said). But when it came down to it, Microsoft's online play was probably the biggest achievement. For the first time, there was an online community that eased the ability of online console multiplayer. Of course I'm referring to X-Box Live. Which lives and strives in it's updated version. X-Box Live is a must if you want the X-Box 360. How else can you boast about your achievements? Which brings me to "Gamerscore". On the X-Box 360, Microsoft introduced Gamerscore as a method of getting gamers addicted to playing. And it worked. I can't tell you how many times PacMan ate three of the powerpellets and died making it to the fourth. But about the 360. The console sends picture in High-Definition. That's 720p HD by the way, not the 1080p Sony and Blueray are pushing. What does that mean? That means better, more realistic picture. But not perfect or "super-real" which is a term that has been used to describe Gran-Tourismo HD for the PS3. It means seeing your car splash through puddles, seeing skin stretch with joints bending and muscles flexing. And speaking of HDTV, The 360 will play HDDVD's, but only with a $150 driver. Otherwise, you'll be limited to the same old 480p. The 360 has focused primarily on the First-Person-Shooters, it seems, gaining some ground in Role-Playing-Games. Which leads me to say, for the casual gamer, This console could become a little expensive. X-Box Live has built an arcade in which (once again) you pay a one-time fee to play old games (as well as some new ones) off your console. Also, unless you're going to spend $35 every three to five games for memory cards, you'll have to pay at least $100 for a hardrive. The 360 plays "most" of the old X-Box games, and they are working on updating their software continually to try to add more. Another annoyance is that every game you play will download an update for it's online play, achievements and sometimes even patch an in-game glitch. This I am classifying as an annoyance because it 1) takes up memory and 2) isn't a one-time deal. Some games will have three or four updates the first time you play. But I have nothing to complain about as far as the interface, playability, and mid- to high- level games for casual and hardcore gamers. Did I mention the computer sync which will allow you to operate your computer from your X-Box? The Bad - Although X-Box 360 is nothing to scoff at (unless you are a die-hard PS fan that refusing to acknowledge the PS3 is/will be a failure) it may be a little daunting for the casual gamer who wants a quiet, quirky, fun platformer. There are a few out there, and they do seem to be increasing in number (what with now trying to compete with the Wii) but the 360 doesn't seem to have anything mainstream that isn't full of glitches. Thank you Sonic The Hedgehog. The casual gamer will find him/herself in the arcade more often than playing a real game. The console heats up (still) quickly which means (once again) make sure you get at least a Version 2, and even so you may want a cooling unit (NOT NYKON). The console sounds like a jet engine. And I don't exaggerate. There is not doubt about when it is on or off. Everything is expensive (Thank you Microsoft). Games are $55 or more, controllers are $40, memory is $35 a pop, even arcade games are no less than $6 and most run $12 or $18. Microsoft even went so far as to maximize profits by ceasing production of X-Box games to focus on the 360. The Verdict - This console is my second choice for Casuals. The 360 is certainly more grown up and you'll be able to grow up faster on the 360 than on a Wii, but unless you know someone who you trust to recommend games to you, you'll end up getting difficult games and miss out on the fun. Don't worry, you'll get your chance to be pwned! But if you jump out to Gears of War online Versus Match too soon, you'll just get slaughterer and frustrated and crawl up with BeJeweled in the Arcade. After all is said and done, the 360 gets a 4 out of 5 for the casual gamer. Make a friend at your local game store - someone who won't try to sell you a $60 game because it's `pretty' - and go out and get your game on.  Playstation - since it was introduced, it was Sega's only competition, N64 was old and Gamecube didn't bring back the following they had hoped. After Sega CD, Sega Saturn and finally Sega Dreamcast (probably the most under valued console of gaming history) Sega threw in the towel and sided with Microsoft to aid with the X-Box. Playstation has been loyal to fans and works backwards compatibility all the way back to the PSone. But we will ignore the PSone and skip straight to the PS2. The PS2 has focused, it seems, in RPG (Role-Playing-Games). Try saying "Final Fantasy sucks" in a crowded room* without invoking both applause and anger. *I don't actually recommend this, and I assume no responsibility for those that do try and get beat up.* These RPG's span from the quirky and fun to the Dark and Brooding. So there is no sense in talking about finding something you'll enjoy (as long as you like RPG's). There are plenty of platformers as well. Although the PS2 has probably the best selection for the casual gamer as well as more of the mainstream titles, it's controller is the most uncomfortable and possibly the least functional. There are four "triggers" that are not pressure sensitive. This makes racing very difficult. I went so far as to change the settings to make the throttle the second analog stick. The PS2 is a horse. You can play for hours without fatiguing the console. Of course, most of the games are meant to be played for hours at a time. There are wireless capabilities, but it requires buying separate wireless controllers (the wired controllers are only about 6' long) which will have you connect a receiver into the front of your console. Memory is fairly cheap, especially if you find a sale (which happens frequently) and you don't mind buying third party (Not Sony). Sony is a name drop and you should expect to pay the price for it. Playstation has also included online play, but it is through ISP's (casuals should have their friends set them up to begin with), not through a community. You'll notice I'm speaking about the PS2 like I have the new-generations of the other companies even though there is a PS3. That's because the PS3 is NOT for casual gamers. PS3 ended up in a "anything you can do I can do better" kick and offered up specs that far surpassed any console that has preceeded. But they paid the price. Or rather, you'll pay the price. The console has a base price of $600. Although it is the only console to offer 1080p High Definition picture, it is very difficult to find good games because, 1) There aren't that many games - it is very difficult to program for the PS3 - and 2) The games that do exist never live up to the hype. Sony has simply made it too difficult to publish a "good" game (read a game free of MAJOR glitches) on their new console. Leave the PS3 for the Playstation devouts. It is NOT for the casual gamer. So I return to the PS2. The Bad - The PS2 controllers are slightly uncomfortable. You may want to get third party controllers and accept the fact that you'll have to sit no further than six feet from the console. The triggers (although there are four of them) don't have enough play to be effectively pressure sensitive. The online play is through ISP, which can make it difficult for a casual to get involved (I recommend inviting a friend over to help you out). Because it is last-generation, it produces picture in regular definition. There are upgrade wires (component and S-video) to improve picture quality, but it's still not high-definition. The Verdict - The PS2 gets a 4 out of 5 for casual gamers (the PS3 gets a 2 out of 5). There is nothing that can be said that I haven't already. The PS2 is a great console, but lacks a few creature comforts that in this day and age, a console needs. No surprise as it is last gen. This console is going to be the cheapest, seeing as it is older. But with several updated models (Slim, Silver) and the capability to play DVD's without a remote, it will fit your entertainment area nicely. Although this console received the same score as the 360, I feel the PS2 will rank 3rd simply because the price simply doesn't make up for it's age.	1
I wish I had done my homework before purchasing this system.  It has half the ram of an regular xbox console.  Game performance was slow.  Navigating was slow.  Size is great.  It will fit anywhere.	-1
I actually only bought this machine two years ago, I spent a long time battling with the fact that there was no in-game surround sound, and not having as good of graphics as the Cube and Xbox -- that kept me from buying it.  I guess I had a change of heart somewhere along the way and decided to give it a try.  I'm glad that I did.  The library of games is almost unbelievable, the only other system with this many titles is the GameBoy, but I must say the variety of genres on this machine is unmatched by any system.  When you go into the game store they have one wall almost entirely devoted to PS2 games, that's tough to argue.  The accessories could be a little more diverse, I recently purchased the Eye-toy and found it to be fun, but it would have been nice to have a Sony wireless network adapter and maybe a HDD like the original PS2 had.  With games like God of War and Killzone this machine has truly been a workhorse.  If you're looking at buying it, even though there are many next-gen choices, go for it.  Sony is committed to PS2 for a ten year period, so there are still many years of service you will get from this machine, and decent titles will still be coming out for it for years to come due to the installed user base of 100+ million owners.  In conclusion:  This is a great machine, and it works great to play DVD's too.	1
Because i'm not a game geek, i only wanted a video game to entertain myself with very good quality and price, i bought this one and i'm very glad with my choice.  I've bought some accessories and games and spent less than only the PS3 console costs. and i mean, memory cards, controls, wheels, games, etc. less definition? it's good enough for me, i can live with that.	1
Having been an owner of a "slim" and small PSONE for several years, after saving some money and wishing to update, I finally bought this new, super slim and small PS2 update system.  If you have a perfectly functioning OLD PS2, there really is no need to buy this.  However, if you're an old, holdout PSONE or malfunctioning OLD PS2 owner, the price justifies the purchase of this new PS2.  The original PSONE update I purchased, as well as some 30 or 40 games purchased for it, all still functioned perfectly, up and until I decided to upgrade (finally!) to a true, blue (black sort of) NEW SLIM PS2.  I think the price should still come down further to about $100, especially considering we now are now (as of this writing) in the PS3, XBox360, and Wiiiiii era.  Which may be a good or bad thing, such as it suits you.  But having studied all systems, if one is on any budget at all, and doesn't have a PS2, buy this.  Buy it now.  You may wait for the price to come down (though that seems unlikely anytime soon given PS3 problems), but at around $130, this is more than a great Vid Game system purchase.  And while one can not only play hundreds of old PS1 titles (all of which mine have performed perfectly on this new system), hundreds more PS2 titles are also readily available, and for peanuts relatively speaking.  While the PS2 (compared to PSONE) graphics are indeed a huge leap in quality, some games from the old system, basically play as they did before.  In other words, if you expect the PS2 to "enhance" old PS1 games, it is a hit and miss sort of thing, and might just be in the mind and eye of the beholder.  Some old PS1 games look a bit better on this, but no worse certainly, but others present a basically PS1 performance.  Which in itself is not too bad, considering the vast and great PS1 game libraries.  Only when genuine PS2 games are played are the incredibly more vivid graphics evident, though it all depends on the game actually.  Generally, this is a giant leap in video games and graphics compared to the PS1, though there ARE some drawbacks.  Nothing to nit-pick about, but in many PS2 games, one MUST use the analog (joystick on the PS1/PS2 controller) sticks to operate a game properly, as the DPAD (general updownleftright) simply won't work.  While this is annoying at times, adjusting to forgetting the DPAD and using the analog joysticks is really not that much of an adjustment, for any game.  I don't know the tech details of why they just couldn't make ALL PS2 (and PS1) games playable with EITHER the DPAD or analog joysticks, but then again, adjusting ain't that a big deal.  If you are used to PC games and PS1 games utilizing the DPAD, adjusting to the loose analog joystick controls will involve a short learning curve, at worst.  If you're going to buy this, by all means, at the very least (in addition to any games you may buy), you need at least one memory card.  Buy the Sony brand if you want to avoid later problems.  Shipping from Amazon was super fast, and without problems.  The unit itself is barely bigger than a DVD case itself.  It's so small, but I've experienced absolutely no problems with overheating, etc.  Be warned however that, there really is no POWER OFF button on this system.  If you do not unplug the unit between gaming sessions (lasting a day or more at least), remember that the machine is still on, and this can be ascertained from the red light button on the unit itself, which tells you that your PS2 is still powered up and ready to go.  If you're not going to use the system for awhile, simply unplug it from the AC connection.  I'd suggest getting an AC extension cord for this connect/disconnect/reconnect, since handling the actual PS2 slim plugin may cause damage with too much plugging/unplugging.  I only have a 56K connection to the internet, so I can't really comment on anything PS2 NET related content, since this particular slim system DEMANDS a broadband and/or DSL and/or CABLE connection to get into any PS2 online functions.  If you want to use this to connect to the net, be aware that you need to have an ethernet/broadband adaptor (more money), plus a high speed net account.  Really though, if you're making the jump from a PS1 to PS2, just forget about net connections for awhile, buy a few games (research them first via the web, and look for cheap bargains), and enjoy your PS1 and newly acquired PS2 games in sublime glory.  Remember, for any PS1 games, you will need a PS1 specific save card (really cheap these days) to save data to resume PS1 games.  If you already had a PS1 and memory card(s) and saved data, no big problem.  Just plug it into one of the PS2's memory card slots to continue.  After awhile however, you will find that you're playing you're old PS1 games (if any) less and less, and PS2 games, more and more.  SO by all means, the very most basic thing you need to purchase with this item, is a good Sony PS2 memory card.  Then you can go wild with searching out and purchasing PS2 games.  I am completely satisfied with my new slimline, tiny PS2, and can't recommend it strongly enough to those who do not already have a solid, functioning old PS2 or who have opted for the Xbox or Nintendo route.  If you have a lot of PS1 games, certainly get this, because you will spend the next year or so "updating" and enjoying.  And this unit is SO SOLID, and shame to those who question it within that frame of reference.  As an aging hipster (early 50's), I have saved all of my PS1 games (which run perfectly on this), have purchased several 80's/90's early video game collections (which run perfectly on this), and a few newer and older first generation PS2 games, all of which, simply knocks my socks off.  It's a shame that Nintendo and Super Nintendo games are not available for this system (Wi and their wacky, money-grubbing folks would rather charge you $$$ a single game than just release a PS2 collection), but so it goes.  With some careful research and buying however, and the absolutely necessary buys for this basic new slim PS2 (the system and a memory card), a few RETRO (retro rules!) and a few newer PS2 specific titles (and may I suggest some Need for Speed, Burnout, Star Wars, etc.), for under $200, you're going to be busy for a long time.  And oh yeah, this plays DVD's (movies, etc.) and AUDIO (or audio burned) CD's wonderfully, and you really don't need an extra DVD player remote.  This DOES NOT play burned CD's with MP3 files however, but so what?  It does just about anything else a Spiderman can, can.  No carping on minor exceptions here.  Extremely easy to set up, solidly built and functioning, if you're really not rich enough to afford the next gen for now, this new revamped PS2 will keep you happy for a long time to come if you're still living in the dark ages of the old school (retro-matrix-borg collective), Nintendo, SNES, Sega Genesis, Atari, PS1 days.  And if you're rich enough, there's broadband/cable connection!  Why carp?  As I write this, for now... and if and until we get some sort of Star Trek Holodeck VR experience in a video gaming system, unless you have the bread and can go for an Xbox360 or PS3, and have broadband/cable, plus a Hi-Def tv/monitor, this is your video game console best buy.  Please Sony, by all means, continue to create and release new PS2 games for a long time to come and try to bring that PS3 price down.  Which I think, shall be, in the near future hopefully.  So it is written, so it shall be done.  Fingers crossed...	1
I'm probably the last person on planet earth to upgrade from the PS1 to the PS2, but now that they're down to a really reasonable price, I couldn't resist.  And boy, am I glad I did!  The gameplay is much more fast paced in the PS2 games.  The PS1 was hampered by the directional pad, but with the analog sticks on the PS2 the characters can move around much quicker and with a much better sense of direction.  And the selection of games is huge, I've only got two so far but I've got about 25 on my wishlist.  This new slimline model is really small, not much larger than the DVD cases that the games come in.  You need to buy a memory card or you won't be able to save your games.  That's about it.  I hooked mine up and it works fine, no problems with overheating (after 3 hours I can barely tell that it's above room temperature).  No problems with noise, it's virtually silent.  Overall, highly recommended for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun with a gigantic selection of games, but doesn't want to spend an absurd amount on a next-gen system that only has a tiny fraction as many games.	1
I recently got a slim PS2. I had owned the standard PS2 system for a while before I eventually sold it and got this version, and this version offers tremendous improvements from its sleaker look and space convienence, to the ease of exchanging disks, to the built in online support. Now if you own the more clunky older version of PS2 and are fine with it I wouldn't put this slim version as a must have product, but unless you plan on picking up one of those new consoles soon (Wii, 360 or PS3) I would say it's something you should concider.  To anyone who has never owned a PS2 and have at least a casual interest in video games this product is simply a must have, and what it comes down to beyond anything is games. There are over 1,000 games that have come out for the American audiance spacifically for the system, and it plays virtually all of the over 1,000 games that came out for the PS1. I hear there are certain PS1 games that don't work with the system, but I have tried numerous games out and haven't had a problem. (Be aware that you need a PS1 memory card to save PS1 games and a PS2 memory card to save PS2 games) In the end the game variety will satisfy any gamer no matter what their tastes.  So bottom line owners of the original PS2 should concider an upgrade, but it's really a must have for those who have never owned a PS2 before. It offers something for anyone, unless by chance they just plain hate video games all together.	1
I use this console when I play ps2 games and also ps1 games. Sometimes I have to push the power button several times before the power goes off. That can be a little annoying. I prefer the Playstation1 game console. It is so much easier to operate, but it doesn't play ps2 games. To bad!	1
In my country I could buy a console with a higher number (modern), but you send me one a little OLD.  So, this console get burn !!!.  I did not return this item because is very expensive for me, I live in Costa Rica.	-1
So many games. Personally I bought this console to play fighting games, especially soul calibur 3.  For my 7-year-old daughter the gamecube is better, she has it since 2005, she has tried many many rentals, and her favorites games are the Mario party series, Zelda games are good too.  The ps2 dominates the dance and karaoke games.  So, I'm trying to say that the ps2 games are mainly aimed for boys and adults, and the gamecube is the better choice for kids.  Now, the wii, ps3 and 360 are another story, but I don't have enough money to waste it in consoles, I have a wife and a daughter.	1
Although most people are now in the market for PS3, PS2 is still GREAT fun for the budget-minded gamer.  The graphics are good, and with the optional remote, PS2 becomes a convenient little DVD player!  Great for the "AVERAGE" gamer.	1
I used to be a Xbox and Xbox only fan.  But now that I tryed playing this ps2  I think I have changed my mind. I got one for xmas this year and it runs like a beauty.  Sony, I love you	1
Now that PS3 is out, PS2 has become more affordable than ever. I have a PS1, and this system allows me to play all of those games. It also works as a DVD player as well, so I can keep it in my gameroom as the sole DVD player as well. The system does run warm, but not much warmer than any of my other DVD players. And Many new PS2 games are still coming out, so this system is not dead yet. Sony has a winner in the PS2, and if PS3 is half as good as PS2, it will be the monster of gaming systems for a long time coming.	1
Okay, I had been having problems for over a year with my first, original ps2 - disc read errors, some dvd/games that wouldn't work, and frequent disassemblies to try to remedy the problems.  A couple of weeks ago, I finished with a ROUGH week of finals (senior in college) and wanted to get some games to celebrate.  I went Saturday morning the day after finals and bought Resident Evil 4 and Gran Turismo 4(the game I was really after).  I stick GT4 in, and the opening movie was going like 1 frame every 10 seconds and the disc was making a bunch of noise.  So I figured I had to take it apart again and readjust the white dial that changes the lens height because it wasn't able to read the disc properly.  The top cover of the playstation slid off my desk while I was working on it and pulled the power/reset ribbon cable out of the socket - so I had to fiddle a while to get that back in.  Then, the controller/memory ribbon cable came out of the socket, and I fiddled with that for a while and could never make it go back in.  Finally, I said SCREW trying to fix this, I'm getting another playstation.  Although, I didn't drive back out that weekend to get another one, so I had two new games just sitting there doing nothing until Monday afternoon after work.  Surprisingly, I had to look at 3 different stores before I found a slim Ps2.  I've been using it for about a week, and I LOVE IT.  It plays all my games, DVDs, its quiet (no noisy PSU fan anymore), I think it seems to load games slightly faster, AND it has a built-in IR sensor - I hadn't heard anyone mention that in all the reviews I read, but this is a GREAT feature - you don't need that bulky thing that takes up a controller slot anymore to use your DVD remote - and you don't have to reconfigure anything. Oh, AND it has a built in network adapter - I'm glad I didn't waste money on one for my old ps2.  Also, I set up the network adapter with zero difficulty.  I've heard the top-loading disc tray being considered a disadvantage.  I disagree.  Less moving parts - less possibility of malfunction!  The lens is exposed for easy cleaning (or damage, so be careful).  I think this design works for longer - just look at how long portable CD players work vs. bulky stereos that have ejecting cd trays.  My past stereos always skipped during songs or wouldn't play it all, but he ol' discman always worked better.  Also, no hard drive capability.  From what I've heard, the hard drive is really only having if you want to play FFXI, but that game costs like $12 a month or something and I've heard it's not that much fun anyway.  One other thing, I think I've read that the slim ps2's are difficult/impossible to mod.  Not an issue for me, but maybe that would bother some people.  I love this thing!!!	1
With all the hype about the PS3, Wii and XBox 360, take another look at the PS2. It has a huge library of games, a reliable system, and is inexpensive!  The PS2, which launched in December 2001, uses DVDs as its storage medium, meaning the unit can double as a CD and DVD player. It is small, light for carrying around, and doesn't have the sound or heat problems that the 360 and PS3 have. It's extremely sturdy - we have two PS2s and haven't had any problems with either one.  The graphics on the PS2 are very impressive, especially some of the later games where the game designers had years to learn how to take advantage of every last detail in the system's design. For a long while the XBox had a clear advantage with graphics, but with some of the recent releases, like Final Fantasy XIII, the cut scenes were just gorgeous.  Speaking of Final Fantasy, with the PS2 you can play all games from the PS2 *and* PS1 series - meaning you can play every Final Fantasy game that is out. That alone could keep you occupied for months if not years. Guitar Hero is another fantasic game that is only on the PS2. The guitar controllers literally cannot plug into a PS3.  Here's a pretty clear indicator of how good the PS2 system is. We've had the XBox 360 for a year, and got the Wii and PS3s right when they came out. Even so, we were still going back to our PS2 to play the games we had on it, rather than bother with moving our save games up to the PS3. The games were really that good.  Sometimes it's not about high def super graphics. Sometimes it's about pure, fun gameplay. The PS2 has perfected that over the years, and there are numerous games on this system that have legions of fans. There's even a network port if you want to play online. Note that it doesn't have "built in wireless" - you have to plug a bridge or other wireless adaptor into the port to have it connect to your home wireless network. This is really easy to do, though, and I have full instructions if you need them.  Well recommended, even in an age of next-gen consoles!	1
This may not be the latest technology, but the DVD/Gaming unit is still very much a excellent unit to own. First off, the price today is very affordable, the game selection is excellent (new and used), and the controlers and such are very similar to PS I, so not much transition to start to play this.  I prefer this unit over X-Box original, even though X box does have a slight edge on graphics.  Very solid unit, and one to buy if you want to have great graphics without the price shock of the PS3 and X-box 360.  This newer/sleaker version still has all the bells and whistles, but takes up much less space. Try it, you'll like it.	1
I traded my Xbox for a PS2 because the PS2 has far more and better games like the: Final Fantasy Series, the Resident Evil series and a great list of RPG... I think the PS2 wins because of the game list but nothing else.  This version of the PS2 is smaller than the original, making it easy to carry and easier to break (its true) its more fragile and it can break if you are reckless with it. I play Resident Evil 4 (was the reason i changed my xbox for a ps2) every day when i have my free time and i have experienced that the PS2 system overheats quickly after 1 hour of playing and I was like "It cant be..." I touched my PS2 and it was very hot that I Just needed to take a break from Resident Evil 4 or even put my own Fan to cool it down!  However... the Playstation 2 can play DVDs which makes it the only system of this generation that can play DVD without a kit (ahem, xbox). When I first put my CD into the PS2 system I noticed that there wasn't a big improvement since PSX, the magic lens are there and you can clearly see it. which means that if it gets dust or if you accidentally touch it your PS2 is GONE.  I still don't know why the PS2 is best selling compared to Xbox or Gamecube.. maybe because of what i said about the game list? yes THAT IS! The controller are the same as expected so don't expect any changes here, sorry.  Dont worry these are just minimal mistakes. PS2 is possibly the best console of this generation (gulp), is enjoyable due to the fact that you get to choose from a wide collection of games. You must buy it you won't be dissapointed.	1
I GOT A PS2 AND I ONLY HAD IT FOR ONE YEAR AND BROKE. THEN, I GOT A REFUND AND BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE AND THAT BROKE WITHIN A YEAR TO!!! SO THATS WHY I DIDNT BUY ANOTHER ONE BECAUSE I KNEW IT WOULD BRAKE IN A YEAR TO. I DONT KNOW WHY IT STOPED WORKING THE STUPID PICE OF CRAP KEEPS SAYING ERROR READING DISC AND NONE OF MY PS2 GAMES WERE SCRATCHED UP!!!! SO DONT BUY IT!!!!	-1
Although the PS2 was the leader of the last wave of consoles it was the least appealing in graphics and game play. I personally would suggest the Xbox if your into features like a internal hard drive with out memory cards, crisp graphics, custom sound tacks, online play out of the box, responsive analogs and controls, or the Nintendo game cube if controls, children's games, and even easier game play matter to you more. I would not recommend this to any one unless they have a soft spot for the controller which is comfortable but when it comes to game play it is the least responsive or if you really like kids RPG's or final fantasy games. The DVD player is an awesome feature but too beware of over heating on the smaller model but this is a very rare problem. Personally I think it has always been over priced. If you notice it is still the same price as the Xbox, which has greater features, or the game cube that has better graphics and better first party games. Now I did point out allot of negatives about the system but it really is the least impressive when it come to actual games. What is impressive is the amount of games in the library. I say age will play a factor. Online is available only on the larger version of the console.	-1
This is the first gaming system we have purchased for our children, and it is a big hit. After shopping and comparing, we decided to get the PS2 for 2 reasons: 1) The price was good compared to the Xbox and, 2) Huge game selection for all ages and interests. A month after purchasing the PS2 we have got our entertainment value from it already. We hit the local video store and took many PS2 games for "test drives." I like The Shadow of the Colossus, and the many fantasy and RPG games available. My wife loves good old Sonic, Pac-Man, and all the arcade games. My daughter loves Curious George, and Chronicles of Narnia. If you are looking for a family gamily system, the PS2 is flexible, and a great value.	1
I haven't owned a console game since the early Atari because I didn't want even more hardware clutter to worry about. So I played PC games for years. The reason I switched to a console was to avoid clogging up my PC with software, drivers, peripheral hardware, IRQ conflicts, and other things that cause the Blue Screen of Death in Microsoft Windows.  The question was, which console to buy: Playstation 2, XBox, GameCube, or PSP?  Sony made the answer fairly easy: The new PS2 is portable, relatively inexpensive, doubles as a CD/DVD player, and most important, has thousands of titles available with backward compatability both now and in the upcoming Playstation 3.  The console is incredibly portable (it has a wall-wart for power, however). The games I've played so far (about a dozen) have excellent graphics and gameplay. Best of all, the games WORK--no crashes, no fiddling with sound and video cards, no Blue Screen of Death. For all of Microsoft's babbling about "Plug and Play", Playstation 2 is the only computer device I've seen that actually does it.  The only reasonable competitor in terms of number of games available is XBox. But there are a lot of things going against XBox:  1. Graphics vs. Price: XBox 360 graphics are known for being "better" than PS2, but you have to be pretty picky to notice the difference. PS2 games look fantastic, and just keep getting better. Any difference that exists doesn't justify the price difference. Not even close.  2. Portability: XBox is a big clunker. PS2 is only slightly larger than the DVD cases the games come in. I can travel with it easily.  3. The Future: PS3 is coming out in November 2006, and it will surpass XBox 360 features in every way (including HDTV). And it will play all previous Playstation games.  4. No Guitar Hero: Guitar Hero is (currently) available only for the PS2. And Guitar Hero is too good a game to miss.  5. Bill Gates: XBox is a Microsoft product, and Microsoft's legacy is to be known as the only company to consistently produce products that don't work for a quarter of a century. Otherwise I would have been happy to keep my games and computer software all in one machine.  The bottom line is that I had my PS2 playing games within minutes of opening the box, have enjoyed them more than any PC game, and it has never, EVER crashed--No Blue Screen of Death. If I decide to get a PS3 later, I can still play all my current games.  And they just dropped the price by $20 in April 2006.  The only thing I don't like about PS2 is the need to buy ridiculously expensive, relatively gigantic memory cards to save games. 8MB cards sell for the same price you can buy a 512MB Compact Flash or SD card if you shop around. The memory card is expensive, huge, and unnecessary. If they can fit 1GB of memory into a tiny iRiver MP3 player, Sony could have fit something--anything--into the Playstation 2. But they wouldn't have sucked their customers dry of cash that way, would they? It smells like MacIntosh when companies use proprietary hardware like that, and the PS2 loses one star because Sony resorted to this sleazy tactic.  Otherwise, the PS2 is a five-star product. Aside from the memory card issue, I couldn't be happier with it.	1
I bought a mini PS2 and was fashioned with it, it looked amazingly it was fantastic, until with a friend we realized the most interesting lie of our lifes, we discovered that this new PS2 has a lot of problems that the old PS2 block will never have. I traded 1 week after that the new Mini PS2 for an old Block PS2 with a hardly very difficult problem, cause they didn't want to get it.  The Mini PS2 has a lot of problems, first the lector lens is more at the open air, you can see if when you open the top part of the PS2, while the Big Block PS2 lector lens won't be seen, unless you open it. This makes the lens more weaker and it can get dirty more easily than the big PS2 lens.  Second the power source for the Mini PS2 is attached just next to it, while you are playing over an hour long the PS2 will overheat more than normal and it can get damage for that, even the lens can get overheated. Instead the old Big PS2 had a separate power source, so that it won't overheat the PS2 nor the lens.  Thrid the new Mini PS2 is more fragile, so if you drop it, it will break even if you drop it to the ground from 1 feet above the ground it can break or get damage. Instead the old block PS2 can resist all hard handles... so you just care it and mess with it.  To be honest, I prefer my new Old Big Block PS2. I been rude to that and it won't let me down, so if you need to choose, pick up the Big Block PS2. ITS WAY BETTER!  UPDATE: Okay I just got an update for you guys, there is a reasonable amount of Mini PS2s that are getting damage between the first 6 and 12 months, I have had friends that regreted trading or selling their old PS2 for the Mini one... as it won't last long, it will break, overheat or get burned! HA what do you think about it?	-1
To me, this current generation of games has remained one of the most unique, and dynamic eras of all time, especially for companies like Nintendo with their compact and convient Gamecube, Microsoft, with the surrealistic experience with the Xbox, and the newly released Xbox 360, and as well for Sony. Sony definitely catapulted their way nearly a decade ago with the successful Playstation system. It really became the very first system to really push the limits of the CD-ROM technology, where other systems like Sega CD, Saturn and Dreamcast have failed. Now what was then, still remains as now.  The Sony Playstation 2, is a much more powerful video game system that really delivers. This smaller, thinner edition of the PS2, absolutely delivers to where other CD-ROM systems have fizzled. The video game system doubles up very nicely as a DVD Player, for all your movie watching need for films of all kinds. The game library remains absolutely endless for so many video gamers of all kinds that you can play here like Jax II, the reved up Gran Turismo 4, Madden '06, the highly acclaimed Reseident Evil 4, and many others. You also can play games on this system with the backwards compatability from the earlier PS1 pr PSX.  The control of the system is also as unique and similar to the previous edition, but it is very simple to respond, and easy to use for all gamers.  All in all, with all the hype for the next generation consoles like the Xbox 360, and the Nintendo Revolution, the Playstation 2 by Sony is a absolute delight for all gamers of all kinds. Even though I actually don't own a PS2, I've played it enough from friends and relatives to know that this game system is a really big bundle of fun. I absolutely recommend this video game system.  Price: B+  Convience: A-  Graphics: A-  Sound: B+  DVD capability: B+  Control: A 1/2-  Fun & Enjoyment: B+  Backwards compatability on PS1: A  Overall: B 1/2+	1
You have to love this classic.  Sony should have added some sort of memory bank eliminating the memory card (sold seperately)to the new model.  One very positive note: the library of games is endless.	1
Playstation 2 is a hard system to beat... and trust me I have had almost all of them. Starting back in the early 80's with the Intellivision and then I moved on to a Nintendo (old school variety), Sega Genesis, Playstation 1 and so on. Of all of those system only the original Nintendo has had the staying power of the PS2. There are literally thousands of games for you to play!    Does the system have flaws? Of course, but so did the Intellivision (I remember I used to have to "blow" into the games or even take the game apart and clean the contacts with a pencil eraser). Nintendo games wouldn't always play, and when they did you had to write down HUGE passwords in order to continue/save. Then Zelda came out with its internal battery/memory so you can save on the game...this was great until the battery wore out a year later!    What are the Playstation problems - well they can be a bit moody and it may suddenly decide to reset itself (all of the other systems did this as well). Mine will not read the cursed "blue discs" (these are discs with a blue backing instead of the standard silver), and a few other minor annouyances, but nothing too big    What is great about PS2? Almost everyhing else - first there is an amazing array of games - from "Kingdom Hearts' (one of my favorites) to "Friends" (a trivia game based off of the tv show - my wife's favorite) to the dancing game with the camera.  Next, thegraphics and sound play are also outstanding. While some complain that it may not be on the level of the XBOX or the Gamecube - all I have to say is that it they beat the crap out of the Intellivision and the Nintendo (both of which I logged many, many enjoyable hours on).    In summary, while some of you may want to wait in the huge lines and pay the incredible amounts of $$$ for the Playstation 3 or the XBOX 360, but for me (at least for now) my trusty PS2 will work just fine!	1
I have used this for a few years now and have enjoyed my time with it. I have bought the stand to make a vertical system and have some extras like the remote control which I highly recommend if you like to watch DVDs. As a games console the PS2 is the leader and so it has a limitless choice of games, however I will say that for some reason over the past few years there has only really been a handful of solid gaming entries and everything else is mediocre and PC graphics are a way ahead of the PS2 now, so if you are a game player looking for the best gaming experience then the PS2 is not for you. What you need is a new computer and a very good graphics card with an ADSL modem or better. PS2 games can be very expensive (4 top shelf games and you have the price of a PS2 - 20 top shelf games and you have the price of a computer we where just talking about.) If you own a PS2 then a DVD store rental card is a bonus and really that rental store card is what the PS2 is about for you. If you do not have that card then I hope you have lots of money or friends to trade with.  I find myself using this box for mostly watching DVD movies and renting games. I buy a new game once every two months (usually a top shelf game) and that keeps me going. For the PS2 I think the type of game that suits the console best is a 3rd person survival game or something like Grand Theft Auto. Beat em' ups are good on it as well. However the PC dominates Sims, RPGs and 1st person shooters. Maybe the PS2 has some influence on sports games like SSX and Tony Hawk but everyone knows that the better experience for these games is on the PC. So what games you prefer really has an impact on if you want a PS2 or not. Maybe a PC is really what you need?  I watch lots of DVDs and with the remote control the PS2 plays like a joy including a special region-free disc that you can buy (its dirt cheap) allowing you to watch anything that comes on a DVD. I have found some incompatibility with some movies (2 in 300) but this is mostly the fault of the DVD producers and not Sony. So 99.9% of movies will play on a PS2. That is not bad. The image quality is not the best but pretty darn good all the same. You can also hook up surround sound to the PS2 no problem and play Dolby Digital or DTS. The PS2 does have one drawback in this department though. The internal fan makes a hell of a lot of noise so you need to keep the sound up to send that to the background. It can be annoying at times. As a DVD player the PS2 has really been used to the max and I have only good things to say about that.  I have also used the PS2 to play CD music through my televisions sound system. It has made my hi-fi system now redundant. So as a console it has lots of media options other than just the games console and that is what really makes it worth its while. However as a games console I must say that I have not been let down that much (games like GTA: Vice City, Silent Hill 3, Manhunt, MGS, Devil May Cry, made the console for me) but there could be a lot better first class PS2 games out there by now. I think there are less than 10 really outstanding games on the PS2 and a way more options on a PC for better games.  Anyway what you like in games is up to you. I have had the PS2 now for years and it is a workhorse that still does its job. I have no complaints about this system except maybe to hope that more developers try pushing the limits of what this box can do. I am currently looking forward to the new Resident Evil game.  Pros:  - Relatively cheap console.  - A wide of variety of games to choose from.  - Expandable.  - Great DVD player (with remote control improves this vastly).  - Reliable and rugged.  - A standard that will never phase out.  Cons:  - Games are very expensive.  - The fan makes a lot of noise.  - A PC maybe really what you want.  - It has taken ages for some good games to arrive.  Overall this a great evolution for the games console. If you have the money and want a portable media system that plays games, DVDs and CDs then the PS2 is really convenient and manageable.	1
This re-designed Playstation2 is truly a sight to behold, literally.  Just pick this thing up and you'll marvel how Sony ever managed to shrink down the PS2 in size and keep virtually all it's features intact.  Just about everything from the original model PS2 is still here, including the features to play old PS1 games and DVD's, as well as a built in modem for online play.  The long abandoned Firewire port is not here, as well as the plug in for the PS2 HDD hard disc drive, which as a previous reviewer mentioned, will likely never be supported by Sony again outside of the Final Fantasy Online failure.  The sliding disc door, which was subject to malfunctions, is also gone here, replaced with a top loading feature.  As for the system itself as a whole, the PS2 stood as the best home gaming console on the market a few years back, but things have changed.  These days, that claim can't be so sure.  Sure, the graphics aren't as superb as they are on Microsoft's XBox, and the online play can't compare to that of the XBox Live either, but the system's exclusive library of game's were at one time second to none.  Since then, Rockstar's controversial Grand Theft Auto series found it's way to the XBox, and some of the past few first party games, particularly the sports titles, have dwindled in quality.  Right now, Microsoft's money making machine has the advantage, but with the upcoming next-gen systems set to flood the market next year, who knows who will come out on top.  That aside, if you have yet to purchase a current console system, the PS2 is an excellent choice to purchase, considering that the system has a huge library of games and possibly the most third party support of any system today.  So if you're looking to buy a current system, you really can't go wrong with this super sleek, newly designed PS2.	1
this is the same ps2 just smaller and is portable and has all the problems of the original design fixed. Like the remote censor thing is built in it so u don't need those censors that u plug in the controller slot. It plays, Ps2, ps1, dvds, cds a incredible system get it.	1
Comparing the Xbox and the PS2, PS2 has the graphics and a good amount of good, worth your time, games. Such titles such as the Ace Combat and Final Fantasy series make it a good balance between performance and games, but it only has two controller slots and you have to BUY the multi-tap adapter for four controllers(I think that was a wrong move by Sony).There aren't that many multiplayer games that are fun enough to give your opponent that "IN YOUR FACE" attitude. There are still not enough games to appeal to people with different interests. Most of the Playstation-only games are quite the same. Some concerns are that there have been complaints that the wires may fray and can be a danger, and the CD tray might freeze or get jammed. If you treat your PS2 carefully, you shouldn't have a problem. At least it can play DVDs. Look at AMAZONs average rating(as of 8-11-05 and has been like this for a while). The Xbox--------avg customer rating = 4 stars The PS2---------avg customer rating = 4 stars The Gamecube---avg customer rating = 4 and a half stars.  KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF REVIEWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE. It looks like the people are more satisfied with the Gamecube.	1
The nice thing about the new slimmer PS2 is that it's smaller so it's easier to carry around. It also has a built-in Network Adapter so you won't have to spend extra money on one. The only downfalls are that it's more fragile than the original model, it can't play blue-discs very well, it has a tendency of getting warm way too fast, and you can't connect an HDD to it. But that's ok, because it has a built in online adapter.	1
I bought this new design just recently and I love it. it's really small and thin and easier to fit in our smaller house. I really think you will enjoy this, it's  definately better than the old and thick, chunky ones.	1
Due to the fact that there are many reviews for gamecube that say that it sucks are are obviously written by people have no idea what they're talking about, I will write my own review for ps2 that reflects the 'tards that write for GCN:  asthis saystem is really suckyd i have horriblesd gframmer and can't typesr worth craap. Anywaqys,, insteasd of syaying anytghinmg important, i willl just saty that PS2 SUXXX abnda get a gamecube. Bnow all you crappy reviewesirs kn ow what o fee;l laikie  Anyways, that's it. The disgustingly sad part is the fact that tons of these reviews get placed on amazon and no matter how often I report them, nothing happens. Welcome to my sad little world.	-1
The Sony Playstation 2 (PS2) is one of the best home consoles ever made, and now it comes in a new, sleek design that's easy to take with you anywhere, even your friend's house!  The PS2 plays Playstation 2 Games, Playstation games, DVD movies, and music cd's.  Hardware: The slim PS2 is about 1/4 the size of the original PS2 and weighs less than half of what the original weighed, yet does almost everything a regular PS2 does. It also has a built-in network adaptor with dial-up and network (broadband) jacks.  Accessories: The Slim PS2 has a lot of accessories, just be aware that it is not compatable with some of the Old PS2 accessories. Also be aware that if you're a fan of FFXI Online, this new slim PS2 is not compatable with the PS2 HDD (Hard Drive).  Games: There are a lot of games available for this system. I recommend for starters the Greatest Hits games, these are usually the best PS2 games and go for under $20.  Overall: I highly recommend this system. In my opinion, it is better than Xbox in terms of game selection and features. Sony most probably will be making and publishing games for this console for a long time, even when the PS3 comes out. Just look at the Playstation, which was released in 1994. They stopped publishing games for that console in 2004. That's a 10-year lifespan! Hopefully Sony will do the same with the PS2.  THIS REVIEW WAS UPDATED ON MONDAY, JULY 18, 2005.	1
if you don't have a playstation 2 and thought about buying one , so i suggest you buy the smaller one ! yes , there are two types of playstation 2, big one and small one , but the small one is much better! first of all, it's much smaller (75% smaller then the other one )and it's also more portable. it's about the size of a very thin book. you can hold it in one hand! also , another thing is , it has a built in network adaptor to play online game , so you don't have to buy one of those because it's already built in ! so, like i said , if you thought about buying a playstation 2 , buy this kind !	1
Playstation 2 is the best console in the world - if you don't believe me buy one and see! There are so many extras in the world of Playstation 2 like singstar, eye toy, as well as exculsive PS2 games. And there is already the newer design to the PS2, it's called the Slimline, it's the size of a DVD case, seriously. And what makes it better is that Playstation 3 will be coming out next year!	1
This is a good product.  Why I say different feeling, because although it is another version of PS2, it is different because the loading of the games is quite faster than the old Playstation 2.  So that I don't have to wait that long.  Good product.	1
HEY DUDE OUT THERE I TELL U WHAT TIS PS2 IS REALLY2 COOL...I EVER HAD PS1 N XBOX...BUT TO ME THIZ IS THE MOST STYLE GAME CONSOLE...	1
the ps2 is a great home gaming system. It has more titles than any othe system and has veryu good grafixs. Not to for get it the only system that plays Grand Theft Auto San Andreas right now. I have had my ps2 for 3 years and I have had no problems with it and I have friends with gamecubes and X boxes and all of them have had problems with thier systems.	1
PS2 is hands down, the greatest and most popular video game system ever made. If you don't have a PS2 by now then purchase one immediately. Video games are Part of so many people lives. Also if you Purchase this system then I recomend New games Like Midnight Club 3, GTA san Andreas.	1
This system is redesigned from the old ps2 and is significantly thinner (about the with of a small paperback book) and weighs 50% less and it's all for the same price as the older models, and still has the 2 usb ports for headsets and keyboards as well as OPTICAL out for Dolby Digital high quality sound. The only changes made were that they did away with the IEEE 1384 (I-link) port so you have to get the new designed multitap for 4+ players, new upright stand, you CAN NOT use the ps2 hdd with this system, top-loading disk tray so there's no more malfunctioning disk drive, intigrated IR reciever for remote access without the small adapter for some of the older ps2 models (also allows you to turn ps2 on/off with SEPERATELY SOLD SONY ps2 remote) and this system has intigrated network abilities (including dial-up internet)so you don't have to buy an adapter. This system also has the best game library and features games like ratchet and clank 3(highly recommend) and jak 3. The game library has 2X more games than that of the xbox and more choice and less "kiddie games" than the gamecube. The graphics are great but the x-box does has better graphics. This system is my favorite out of all three and I would recomend getting it.	1
I unwittingly bought a PS2, not knowing that I'd get a god awfull small game controller. I used it for a month and now I can't hardly move my hands or my fingers. Don't buy Playstation 2. They've ruined my future. I'm writing this review right now by using a voice typing program that Microsoft published especially for people who've ended up in my poor situation.	-1
Sony your the best! Buying this is highly Recommened. I bought it for 300 Cha Ching but it was worth it. I hope it does not let you down.	1
Well, I have to give it four stars because I haven't had it for very long (3 months), and I only have the PS1 to compare it to.  So far, however, it has worked great.  After owning a reliable, fully functional PS1 for the last few years, I expect nothing but the same from this gaming console.  The only problem I've had is that it doesn't seem to want to recognize one of my Dance Dance pads.  Strange.  It's not the pad, because it still works with my PS1.  And the other pad works fine.  *shrug*  I don't know what to say about that.  You can use your PS1 controllers on the PS2, so you don't have to buy extra stuff to play two-player games.  The compact design may help it travel more, but I don't intend to use it for that.  I've been playing Grand Theft Auto:  San Andreas mostly, but I've rented other games, and I've been happy with the way they've all been running.  The graphics are truly amazing.  The processing speed blows my mind.  I don't know, however, if people shouldn't just wait for the PS3 to come out next year (2006).	1
I've been a fan of Sony's gaming machines since the debut of the PS1 all those years ago.  When my big old box of a PS2 (one of the first to come out, mind you) up and died in November my heart was broken. But, thankfully, the PSTwo's were coming out the same day. What a great coincidence! I ran out and bought one.  Flash forward four months. Here I sit staring at the now-dead PSTwo. She will no longer play any games or DVDs, giving instead the dreaded "The Disk Could Not Be Read" error (modified up from the old "Disk Read Error" message--thanks, SONY!). Lens cleaners have failed and there's no little white wheel inside that a felt tip marker and some internet help can adjust (as was the case in the older models). Did it overheat? She gave off a nasty smell..and it's known that the PSTwos get very warm to the touch, despite being loaded up with heat sinks and yes, even a little fan that does a great job blowing the already scorching hot air on to critical parts. Was it just an unlucky, bad unit? Did it have something to do with Sony's rumored use of cheap parts? Do these new units have some inherent design flaw which results in a very short and terminal lifetime?  I don't know. You decide...just keep this in mind before you plop down a hundred and fifty bucks. The PS2 is still the best console with the best selection...buy criminey! Whatever happened to the days when you'd buy a product and it *wouldn't* fall apart after a few months??  Happy gaming...	-1
I am tired of hearing people saying this ps2 has no fan. It does. It has an internal fan. I have had no problems out of it. I can sit and play gta san andreas and not have to worry about over heating. So if u don't have one, and u have that old piece of crap ps2. Don't judge this one	1
PlayStation 2 is a lot of fun.  The graphics are pretty realistic and the games are a lot of fun.  There are so many features that make it the best gaming system out there.  First, it has there biggest game library available. PS2 & PS1 games can be played on PS2 so there's a game out there for everyone.  Next, about 85 million Americans (about 7 out 24) own a PS2 so there are a lot of people to play with.  And PS2 gamers are all different ages from five years old to forty year old "kids" and probably a lot of people even older than that.  Also, The new PS2 model comes with a network adapter built in the PS2 so you are ready to play people online without buying any extra accessories (except a phone (dial-up) or Ethernet (DSL or Broadband) cable).  Some games can play online with a dial-up and Broadband Internet access but most games play online with a broadband access only.  Broadband users need a broadband or DSL modem and an Ethernet cable (wired users) or an Ethernet adapter (wireless users but not all wireless accessories are compatible with PS2 so make sure to check first).  Dial-up users can just plug right into a phone jack and play.  The best part of PS2's online play is that its FREE!!! (unlike XBox for $49.99 a year or GameCube's $9.99 a month for the two games available for online play).  Another good thing about PS2 is accessories and games are easy to find and abundant in many places.  I also own a GameCube and games are harder to find and are more expensive.  Also, most GameCube games are intended for little kids and also there are pretty much no online games (except for two).  PS2 games are available pretty much anywhere (I've seen some racing games at Pepboy's and Auto Zone and some games and Menard's [a hardware store in the Midwest]).  Memory cards and controllers are cheap and available in a lot of places.  Another good reason is the size.  It's very small (the picture makes it look big).  It's about a little more than an inch high, nine inches long (from the left to the right) and about 6.5 inches from the front to the back.  A vertical stand is available to make it take up hardly any space.  One last good reason to buy it is the extra things available for PS2.  One reason is the EyeToy.  Its exclusive to the PS2.  Its like a web cam you put on top of your TV.  You use your body to play the game. (games include fighting a guy, riding a skateboard, heading a soccer ball, using your hands to dance and use maracas, and to swat away evil things.  A LOT MORE games are available).  Also, a dance mat is available for dancing games (like the games available in the arcades).  These games are a lot of fun and make a great game for parties.  One last accessory is a gun controller.  You shoot guys on the screen (for certain games [Time Crisis 1, 2, 3, and more]) like the games in the arcade.  Also, PS2 can play audio CD's and DVDs without buying any extra accessories (a DVD remote is available but not necessary unlike XBox).  This is why you should buy a PS2.  The numerous features make it a the best system to buy out of PS2, GameCube, and XBox.  For choosing a system, I recommend to choose based on which system your friends have, what games you like on that system, and what features you want.  I recommend NOT choosing based on who has the better graphics or to pick a system for just one game.  PS2 is definitely worth the $149.99 and is my favorite system.	1
If u want a ps2 u should get this but if ur new to gamming u should first get an XBOX, i just bought a ps2 for Final Fantasy! Sony has really over priced there ps2!	1
I purchased an XBox two months ago and I like it allot especially conisdering all the bells and whistles it has. I like the XBox and I highly recommend it to everyone as it is possibly the best "overall" gaming console available. My last video game machine before this was the Dreamcast which I still consider as one of the best video game consoles ever released.  Neverless, I have wanted a PS2 system for quite some time since there are so many great games that have been made for it and I had recently heard that SONY had released a newer and smaller version with some improvements. Several days ago after searching around for stores that carried it I finally found a place that had it in stock at one of the large electronics chain stores. A friend gave me  a new DEMO of a boxing game by EA Sports (Fight Night Round 2).  After opening the box I realized how small this system was which I really liked.  It is a little bigger (a half inch longer and an inch wider) than the size of two DVD boxes stacked on top of each other.  I popped in the DEMO game and WOW! I love this little powerhouse of an entertainment system.  I actually played the DEMO boxing game for hours. I was so excited about my new little system that the next day I ran out an bought "Hot Shots Golf Fore!" golf game, a Logitech wireless controller, and the Sony 8MB memory card.  I have the system set up on top of my rather small bedroom dresser next to a 13 inch TV. I can play music CDs, DVDs (including  recordable types) and of course all PS2 & PS1 games.  This new PS2 is really a "must have" considering SONY has made many small improvements in the machine compared to the older and larger PS2s.  The new slim PS2 plays DVDs and CDs very well and it supports wide-screen TV format, progressive scan, Dolby surround, DTS, etc.  I did a detailed visual examination of the laser pickup and the rather beefy laser tracking motor and it seems to be really well built despite the new slim PS2's smaller size.  The top loading flip mechanism is similar to the old PS1 design and there are quite a few vents to provide good ventilation for the main processors.  I believe SONY is using a newer, smaller, slightly faster, cooler running PS2 on a chip for the processing. I found the load times not to be a problem and in the system setup you will find settings for faster DVD player tracking and there is even a graphic enhancement setting.  One of the main drawbacks and a big reason for me not buying a PS2 before now was what I read about problems with the DVD disc tracking system which caused read errors, slow load times. There were also problems with jagged graphics in some of the earlier games.  In the games I have played so far on the new slim PS2 I have not seen any of these problems with the machine.  I will admit that the XBox does seem to have more detailed textures and background graphics especially on the massive games like Halo 1 and Halo 2 but compared to the games I played on the slim PS2 I have not noticed a night and day graphical difference between the two machines. It is also important to remember that most software companies write a game title to port across multiple systems. When you get the XBox version it often is not that different or maybe just a notch better graphically than the PS2 version.  When a game is written exclusively for XBox then you can see where the extra power of that system enables more capacity for programming eye candy but this is done most often for the exclusive games.  I have not tried the broadband online gaming for PS2 but from what I have read most people agree that the XBox is far superior for online gaming if you don't mind paying the $40-$50 a year for Microsoft's XBox Live subscription service.  PROS:  Small footprint, very portable, many small enhancements over the previous PS2 version, built in high speed ethernet and built in modem for online gaming, largest game library of any console, plays DVDs, CDs, PS1 and PS2 games. As of right now while I write this review the online internet game play is free of charge.  CONS: Not as graphically powerful as XBox. Not as well designed for online broadband gaming as XBox. The PS2 is the oldest design of the current generation of available console gaming machines (Gamecube, XBox, PS2).  It uses outdated 8MB memory cards and there is no larger capacity hard drive storage like the one that comes standard with the XBox or as was available as an add-on for the older large PS2. You must purchase a multitap if you want to use more than two controllers.  Despite being the oldest of the current consoles this is really a great little machine. It is well designed and it seems to be durable. I highly recommended the new slim PS2 to all console gamers even if you are a current owner of the XBox, Gamecube, or older large PS2 game systems.  The bottom line...Five Stars!	1
Sony failed to consider one thing for this redesign.....A FAN!!!!  I had to replace my original PS2, which finally died after about 5 years of abuse.  It took me forever to find one of the "newer, slimmer" PS2 consoles.  I did manage to buy one, and within 2 days of use, it died.  I took the stupid thing back for an exchange, but the EB Games where I bought it was out, so I got a refund.  (Great customer service by EB Games, by the way.)  I got to talking to the girl that was working there, and she said that these have been recalled because they have been overheating.  The fan that they put in it is just way too small to handle the heat generated by the unit, and the design is too small to allow proper heat dispersion.  Apparently Sony is being very hush-hush about the recall, but now I know why I couldn't find a single one at Best Buy, Circuit City, Wal-Mart, Target, HH Gregg, or K-Mart.  I was driving around all of Northeast Ohio for a day, getting more and more curious as to why none of these stores had any.  I didn't think it was because they were super-popular, and it seems as though it certainly wasn't that.  Way to go, Sony - Unleashing a redesigned piece of crap instead of just investing the time and dollars into developing the PS3.  Dummies.	-1
I'm happy I own a PS2.  I enjoy playing the games and they're pretty good.  Some of the great things Sony did with their systems are worth a mention.  At first, I owned the 30001 model.  Then, I sold my unit after buying a 50001 model, which included the internet adapter, and now plays DVDs in anamorphic widescreen.  (My old model did not play them anamorphically.)  I bought the newer unit because I read an article in a videogame magazine that said there was a graphical improvement in models 33001 and later.  I don't remember exactly what the improvements were because I read it a long time ago.  These newly-redesigned, slim models make transportation easier.  The power pack is now externally in the A/C wire, which means that's where all the weight went, but the unit is still smaller.  Although I prefer the new unit, I have two things, which are not really large enough to make complaints, but they may interest people who are considering buying the new model, or even replacing their old model with the new one.  You probably already know the newly-designed PS2 cannot use the hard disk drive that was sold with the Final Fantasy game a while back.  If you bought one of these, you should keep your old one.  Another feature that changed is the method of ejecting the disc from the player.  I think the idea of this new design is pretty good for guys like me that like to keep their console close by when they go places; however, the disc now ejects differently.  Before, one could eject a disc by pressing a button and a motorized tray ejected out of the face of the unit; now, it ejects like a portable CD player, meaning it has a lid.  When you press the button, the lid pops upward and the disc must be pulled from a spindle in the topside (if it's lying flat).  At first, I thought the redisigned unit would now fit inside a certain spot in my entertainment center, but I cannot do this because the disc now ejects out of the top, and this means I need room around the top.  Not a big deal, but a factor.  That's it, but if I may be critical of Sony for a moment without turning it into a smashing contest, Sony has always had one single flaw they never amend: the accessory-compatibility issue.  First, in all of Sony's PS1 & PS2 machines, there are only two controller ports, which means PlayStation games rarely have four-player modes; so, unless you're a James Bond game fan, you probably didn't pay the $30 for the Multitap.  This reinforces itself: since most people only have two controller ports, PlayStation videogame companies mostly make games that don't utilize the Multitap.  Second, although it isn't hard to get an older model of the PS2, (again) the hard disc drive doesn't work with this new model.  Third, the first, original PlayStation models had a Sony LinkCable port, but the Dual Shock model and afterward (including the redesigned PSOne model) eliminated the port.  This means games you could normally play multiplayer by connecting two PlayStations with the LinkCable, you cannot do this anymore.  Although not many people have the LinkCable, even fewer people have access to the feature now.  Perhaps this has nothing to do with the PS2, but it does help prove Sony's history of designing a machine around its peripherals.  In other cases, the changes were virtually always inarguable improvements to their unit.  Why doesn't Sony make four controller ports?  I don't know.	1
Sony deletes the functionality of the hard drive upgrade and calls this an improved design. I beg to differ!  Find the original full sized model unless you plan on putting this in your car or live in a very small box or van "down by the river!"	-1
I just got a ps2 when they came out with the slim  design. I decided to get it since it looked so cool,  I havnt had a ps2 yet and there are so many great  games for it, and was getting kinda bored with the  gamecube. Man is this thing small! its so great!  I bought the gta double pack since ive honestly  never played the games and there great! playing  them on this small system is so fun! i bought  lots of Greatest Hits games for this system, like  max payne, gta double pack, devil may cry 2,  kingdom hearts and a few more. This is like  the best system! I own a gamecube and had an xbox,  Gamecube is great and all but Is lagging on any  great games right now, and the xbox....  ive had so much problems with it...  its broken so many times! so many errors! the xbox  is just a crummy machine and is so huge!  Get the new ps2 you won't be dissapointed!	1
The new design on the PS2 is a great improvement - particularly the top load.  Buttons can be a bit difficult to hit without a careful inspection, but the stationary top-loader prevents some of the problems with the original's tray design.  It's small enough to store easily, and I like it a lot more than I did my original.	1
Primero,  esta versin super delgada es bastante porttil, muy manejable, pero para manipularla hay que tener mucho cuidado porque da la impresin de ser muy frgil, especialmente la puerta del lector de discos.  Los menes son muy sencillos lo que facilita la configuracin del equipo.  Es excelente que tambin pueda reproducir pelculas en DVD, aunque el equipo se calienta muy pronto, se obtiene muy buen desempeo de audio y video.  Sus 128 bits permiten ejecutar magnficos juegos como Prince of Persia The Warrion Within sin mayor retardo y utilizando el mximo de efectos visuales, sombras, iluminacin y vistas panormicas.  Su capacidad de conectarse mediante cable telefnico y cable de red con otros equipos lo hacen un equipo con muchas capacidades de comunicacin ampliando las oportunidades de diversin en lnea con otros jugadores!!  En fin, estoy muy satisfecho por haber adquirido este equipo.	1
I have heard that alot of people have wanted one of these but they don't make enough of them. Some people might think that it looks fairly horrible,wrong! i thought the slim design is better for a much smarter look and great for less space. Twice as small as the original and cheaper in some cases than the bulky. This really does look nice out of the box so smart and dosen't look anything like a games console. If you are thinking about buying one, buy the slim design, you won't be dissapointed when you see it out of the box.	1
The new, slim design of the PS2 is great! It just blends in with all the other A/V components around my TV. It isn't much larger then the cases that hold Playstation games.  The only thing I don't like about the new design is the top-load disc player. The design is better, no motorized drawer jams to worry about, but the part that opens and closes feels really flimsy. Not a good feel for the part that gets the most use.	1
First of all, i don't know what that person was talking when he said that, "Gamecube is the best", first, Gamecube doesnt even play cd, dvds and it mostly has corny kid's games. It is a child-based game system between ages(3-13). PS2 is the best because of it's retail value and the fact that it has more games than XBOX and Gamecube and they also have much more discounted games than either of those systems. There are so many games to choose from when using PS2. Yes, the PS2 doesn't have as good as graphics as the XBOX but at least you don't need a remote control to play your dvds or cds, just use the paddle for PS2. Besides, Sony in general is the best name brand of the three. Microsoft is not noted for making good hardware products, their networking essentials do not work well at all. When XBOX first came out it had major issues of over-heating and in some instances I heard that some actually caught fire. I think Microsoft caught on to that and fixed the problem some-what. I work in retail for Circuit City and Gamecubes hradly sell at all, we never run out of it and it always seems that we run out of PS2's every single week. Overall PS2 is the Number-One game system out there right now.	1
Everyone keeps reviewing PS2 in general, and it's completely irrelevant. This is a NEW version. So let me review the one I got.  This is the new smaller design, a little bigger than a DVD case. While it may look cool, it is NOT recommended. The only pro is how cool it looks.  The CONS:  Will accept PS1 Memory cards and old PS2 Memory cards BUT will not let you use them until you reformat them. This means if you wanted to continue that game you had saved on there, DON'T COUNT ON IT.  The door for the game tray is a flip up instead of a drawer. You'd think they'd have learned not to go back to this since their last design failed so frequently with this function.  The only reason you should get this Playstation is if:  A - You have never owned a Playstation before  B - You have no friends that own Playstations (so you won't have to worry about bringing games over eachothers places, or showing your pal where you are on the game via his Playstation)  C - You don't intend on playing your old games on the new system, in any way shape or form. (Except by starting at the beginning and replaying the game all over again).  Maybe I seem a little bitter, but my main grudge is that I just got home from playing a game I started at a friends house, put 4 hours of work into, then brought home. Then I popped the memory card in, played for another 4 hours (all the while, saving and having the playstation tell me it saved successfully).. when I realized that the game I was "overwriting" was actually the same game over and over. It never overwrote anything. So now, when I turn off my playstation, there goes 4 hours of work.  And what happens when I put in the NEW PS2 Formatted Memory card to see if I can save on that? oh HELL NO. Ofcourse not, it won't even recognize the memory card while the game is still in.  Thanks a lot Playstation. Atleast if my new XBox screws up, I can save it to the hard drive. Jerks.	-1
I sold all of my video games when I went to college but this new model Playstation 2 finally convinced me to buy a system again.  To me, the redesign is a huge advantage over the other systems. I have friends who have the old model of PS2, and they all love this sleek, streamlined machine. So does my fiancee, who calls it "the sexy little game system."  I don't want to get into the juvenile "PS2 vs. XBox vs. Gamecube" debate, so I will just say that I chose the Playstation 2 because it has the biggest library of great games available. When you consider all the latest hits like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Madden 2005, and Metal Gear Solid 3 --- and then combine that with the appeal of playing any of the classic (and affordable, usually $20 or less!) PS titles like Final Fantasy Tactics and Crash Team Racing, for me this was undoubtedly the system I had to have.  Any doubts about the system's hardware stability, spread by online rumor-mongering, were unfounded. I've had this new PS2 for over a month now; I play it for hours at a time; and it has not overheated, crashed, or frozen up even once.	1
Sony did just fine with original PS2.  Sure its graphics aren't nearly as good as Xbox, or have a hard drive like the Xbox, but it has way more games, and allot of them are really fun.  Instead of optimizing the HDD, Sony has cut it out.  It made the system quiter, but reduced the size of the fan-which equalls more disk errors and game freezes and it happens faster than ever.  This system is completely pointless and insufficient compared to the original PS2.  I love Playstation, but I cant give this system praise like all the other PS2 fans out there because it was made by Sony.  Here is how it is-Xbox is a much better system, PS2 has many more fun games to play.  Put the two together and it would be impressive at least.  I suggest anyone looking to buy the new PStwo to spend the extra $40 and get the original, or an Xbox.  If you want to buy a present for your kids, this flimsy toy thing will be smashed within a month, waste of money and time.	-1
The new-design PS2 is IMHO a vast improvement over the original PS2.  Not only is it slimmer and prettier (take that, Xbox!), but it's also quieter, loads games faster, has better DVD support, and has built-in networking.  The last feature is especially cool for those of us who never bought the network adapter for the original PS2.  Considering old PS2 + network adapter packs are still selling for $180 or more online, the new PS2 is a steal.  OK, so PS3 this is not.  It's just a souped-up PS2, or PS2+, perhaps?  Is it worth your $150?  Let me put this way:  if your current PS2 works fine and you have no interest in online play, then don't bother getting this one.  The slim design alone is not worth the price.  On the other hand, if your PS2 is wearing down (judged by game-loading failures, whines from the motor or fan, flashes on screen, ...), or if you want to do online play but never bought the network adapter, here's your chance to get into the action and own a shiny new, prettier-looking PS2.  PS2 is still relevant in teh game console world today (Nov. 2004) because of its vast game library.  Its graphic engine is inferior to Xbox and Gamecube, but not really by that much in real-world terms.  It's great.	1
I don't see the point in this remake. For one thing the disc drive is now toploading so if people would buy this becuse they don't have much space in their cabinet can forget it. For example if you had slipped it into a small space you would have to remove it when you want to put a game in. Althought this is slim and great looking i don't reccomend it. What has annoyed me about sony is that the more popular the playstation gets the quality gets worse because they think that it is so popular that it won't matter. I own a ps2 (fat) a gamecube and a x-box. out of the 3 the x-box is the best then ps2 then gamecube (purely because of the amount of games) My ps2 was given to me about a year ago and it was one of the first ps2s made because my cousin bought it on the launch date. I havnt had any problems with it at all but most of my friends who own ps2s have had something go wrong with them. I think that the more popular ps2 gets the cheaper sony makes them for so they break more. I reccomend the fat ps2 because it has sliding disc tray and iy is sooooo better. One of my friends has the slim ps2 and it is tiny, About the size of a ps2 game case. But the disc toploader feels flimsy and when you open it it is not a smooth action. If you have buy a ps2 buy a fat one because they are the best in my opinion but buy an x-box because they are the best or just buy an x-box.	-1
First off let me start by saying, this is NOT going to be a PS2 bashing. Though we all have our opinions on the three systems, the fact is that they are all great systems in their own right. That is to say you won't go wrong no matter which one you choose.    Let me reiterate, this is not a bad system. It has several great games (Final Fantasy X & X2, Grand Theft Auto Series, WWE Smackdown Series and several others). Though it must be noted that Gamecube and XBox both have great exclusive titles. The graphics are outstanding and they may not even be the best of the three, but they are great, certainly better than anything we had just a few short years ago. They definitely have more benefits than everybody else (free online gaming, the Eyetoy, and more games. As far as controllers go, I like Gamecube's a bit better, but this controller works wonderfully well too and is well laid out. (You won't be searching for the buttons like you do on XBox controllers, that is my one true complaint with that system).    One thing that irks me about the new design is the lack of support for the hard drive.  It's not a huge issue unless you want to play Final Fantasy XI or take advantage of HDD capability as with ESPN NFL2k5.  Not a big deal, but something could have been worked to support it.   I do like the smaller, slimmer design.  It certainly helps when you have many systems old and new and are lacking in space to have them all setup at once.  You almost have to see it in person to truly appreciate the size reduction this thing has undergone.  While the old one is regarded as somewhat of a "clunker"; this thing is small, sleek, and powerful.  I wish they could have found a way to include four controller ports (should be an industry standard) as opposed to just two.  It's not a big issue but a bit annoying for those who enjoy playing multiplayer sports games.   Anyway Playstation 2's biggest downfall is in the fragility of the system itself and though I have experienced no problems personally, I have heard of a few from close friends.  1. Disc Reading Error (This is very likely a non-issue with this newer model.)  2. Malfunctioning Disc Door (This is no longer an issue because the system is now top-loading.)  3. The power cords tend to wear out faster than average. (Not a big deal, the cords are fairly cheap, but it could present a fire hazard.)    None of these things would be a huge deal except that the PS2 comes with a measly 90 day warranty (Do I hear 1 year anyone?)    I'm not trying to say this system is junk. It does have durability issues more than anything.  Some of these problems should be lessened/eliminated with the new model. I personally prefer Gamecube but only by a small margin. All of you who immaturely spout "PS2 rules, Gamecube & XBox suck" are not only lying to yourselves, you're doing a great disservice to the readers who depend on these reviews to make an important decision.    The bottom line is the Playstation 2 is a great system and definitely worth the money, but it is not gaming perfection as some make it out to be. Try Gamecube & XBox as well. All three are extremely fun!!!	1
The PS2, is... just... great...  REMAKE- 5/10  Sony doesn't  need to think about a new little slick and slick design... They really need to concentrate on making the next gen console, PS3. (Even though this is nice, but i think it's just about enough remakes...)  +======+======+=======+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=============  PS2  Games: 10/10 There are many exclusives for the PS2, including Jak 2, TEKKN, -----EyE tOy-----, and more.  And the system is backword compatible, which is great!  Graphics: 8/10 Great graphics! (but not perfect)  What I would expect from the PS3 is Revolutionary graphics... (that you don't get on a good PC)(The XboX graphics are a bit better, but the system is DISGUSTING! and has less titles)  Controller: 10/10 It's as simple as it's gonna get. And simple=comfortable (plus very good vibration, almost "anolog" vibration...)  Accesories Needed: 5/10  You gotta get a memory card, (not built in with online), and why don't Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft sell an extra controller?!  Outside apperance:(PS2) 7/10  Nice and pretty compact... (look at the Xbox...)  Outside Apperance: (PSTwo) 10/10  Great compact thin small and slick design...  Overall: (PS2) 8/10  Overall: (PSTwo) 9/10 (internal hard disk needed!)  I Reccomend to get the PS2! (not Xbox/gamebube/  ???Dreamcast???/!?!?!?!?!?!?SNES?!?!?!?!??!?!/------NES----)	1
This new playstation 2 is awesome.  To answer some quick questions I get asked a lot about this is does it have better graphics or faster loading.  NO it does not.  It also does have an HDD bay which sucks for the final fantasy players.  Luckily I don't play that so I'm in good shape.  The new playstation is 1/3 the size of the original makeing it very convinent to carry around.  You may notice that it doesn't have a fan so your wondering is it going to overheat.  Not really because it has a very nice intercooling system that keeps the ps2 at a appropriate temperature.  It does tend to get a little warmer then the other ps2 a little faster but nothing to worry about.  If your looking to save room in your entertainment system get this.  If you have a older playstation 2 and have room and it works good just keep that.  The new playstation is cool but it's just smaller.  Hopefully it's not going to break fast like the older ps2 model.  If your planning on purchaseing a playstaion 2 and you don't have one by this one instead of the big one.	1
First, I love the new "PS Two" re-design! I was impressed when I first opened the box and saw how much smaller & lighter Sony had made it. Man, the buttons are tiny! I like the top load instead of the front open tray. Less mechanical parts = less to potentially break/wear out.  I do wish it was available in transparent colors that matched the controllers. That would rock!   The previous PS2 online pack w/ the built in adapter was clunky looking but included a game (ATV 2) at the same price(150). I don't know why they don't offer a game w/ it anymore.  I noticed the blue LED when it's on was lost for some reason, blue is the PS2's color!  Anyways, I see a lot of people complaining that it's still 150$ and not 100$ like the "kiddie" gamecube. Personally, I'm just happy it's FINALLY half than the original 300$ tag and it's been improved. ie: Quieter , a lot smaller, a lot lighter, built-in network adapter, updated interface, progressive DVD, etc. This and my XBOX will hold me over until the XBOX 2 and PS3 are finally 150$.	1
The original PS2 had many different versions. Now, here is the very best, PS2 version, and it's even MORE better than Xbox and Gamecube than it was before.  =Graphics=  The graphics are waaay better than Gamecube, but not as good as Xbox. 8.5/10  =Number of Games and Their Quality=  Playstation2 has the best games and more games than Xbox and Gamecube. 10/10  =Number and Quality of Controllers=  Playstation 2 has the best handling of controller, better than Xbox and waaay better than Gamecube, however there are only 2 controller ports and you cannot store memory in the controllers. 7.25/10  =Loyal Games=  PS2 has many loyal games that either come out for PS2 first, or don't go over to other consoles. There are Tekken, Grand Theft Auto, Gran Turismo, Final Fantasy, and Kingdom Hearts, and maybe even more. However, alot of the games went to other platforms. Tekken went to GBA, GTA went to GBAC, GBASP, Xbox, Dreamcast, and PC, Gran Turismo went to GBA, and one of the Final Fantasys went to GC, so they aren't very loyal to PS2. 08/10  =Other Generation Gameplay=  Playstation 2 can play PS1 games, wheras for the Xbox cannot play PC games and Gamecube you must buy the Gameboy Player to play Gameboy games on it.  =The Future=  Plsyation 3 has been heard of for a long time, and so far it will have better graphics, and memory card storage to the controller.  =Online Gameplay=  This version of PS2 has a builtin online combo, so you don't have to buy an extra HDD!  Overall, I'd definitely tell you to buy this PS2 if you already don't have the original. But even if my review did not convince you, I'd suggest you buy Xbox if you don't already have it because it is very good and the next best thing to PS2. Don't buy Gaecube. The quality is just horrible.	1
Sony's refreshening of the venerable PS2 is both a marvel of technology and a mild disappointment all in one teeny tiny little package.  Yes, it's no PS3, and many fanboys will discount the redux as "money-grubbing", choosing to stand by their Xboxes or Gamecubes.  However, to completely dimiss the redesign out of hand will be a mistake to anyone interested in a more portable game console.  Make no mistake, as popular as the other guys' consoles are, there is no game platform with more titles than the PS2.  And that huge library is full of fantastic games that are still very much "in" (GTA:San Andreas and the Gran Turismo series come to mind).  It's hard to argue against the borg that is Sony, and having the largest selection of titles makes the PS2 a fair choice, regardless of your game genre or system preferences.  But on to the new top-loading PS2 itself: this thing is small. While it lacks the motorized CD tray, anyone who travels frequently, whether it be a visit to a friend's house across the street or flight across the country, will appreciate the miniscule size of the box.  About a third the size of the original, the new PS2 is perfect for slipping in a backpack, or tricking out your bling-bling ride.  What makes this even more impressive is the integration of the network port.  Once a separate pay-for option, the built-in networking (both ethernet and dial up modem no less) not only makes the price more reasonable, but definitely ups the cool factor a notch.  The system is also very quiet and surprisingly cool, despite a reduction in internal fans.  There is one noticeable issue with the new size, however.  There is no hard drive interface, so Final Fantasy gamers with hard drives are out of luck (at least until they make a USB or other type adapter).  Overall, the smaller PS2 is a console worthy of consideration.  It's a great choice for both newcomers to the console world as well as folks with extra cash burning a hole in their wallets who need a travel-sized system or replacement to their existing PS2s.	1
The New designed PS2 is just under 9in Long, about 6in Wide, and barely over 1 in Thick. It's just a little bigger than a VHS tape. It has a top loading system,the door pops up . The hole in your game disk clicks into place. Just like a portable CD walkman. It's much ,much ,smaller than the first design. I love the small design. The only negative is no memory card is supplied. The main reason to own a PS2 is ,simply , There's just more games than other consoles. I also own an Xbox . Which of course is the best of all consoles graphics wise ,plus its internal hard-drive. But you need to buy a dvd remote to play dvd's on the xbox. The PS2 plays dvd's  right out of the box. So both consoles,have there little trick to squeeze a little more cash out of your pocket . If you wanna improve graphics on your PS2 ,I strongly suggest you get either an "S" cable, Or a component cable. First look at the back your TV ,if you have a black input that's kinda funky looking,thats an "S" video input and underneath will be red and white for audio input. If you see any blue input than that means you have also component input which is the best video input for graphics. There mostly on expensive tv's. But most TV'S have an "S" cable input which is better graphics than the supplied RCA plugs ,red,white,yellow ,that come with the PS2. You'll notice a difference in clearer graphics with the " S" cable ,or even better the "component" cable. Sony makes a good "S" cable,about $29.00. Ive tried the monster cable's ,but I had some problems with my cable. I'd stick to the SONY brand "S"cable. But Iv'e heard that madcatz "S"cable at walmart for $10.00 is just as good. With so many good games coming out on the XBOX . It's hard for me to say the new PS2 is a good buy ,not because of quality,but because of price,But $149.99 aint bad and I got a memory card for $19.99 at Circuit City. The PS2 has tons of games .Much more than the XBOX. Maybe wait until there's a good ps2 bundle .But the the new PS2 design rocks. It's highly portable. I have both systems xbox,and ps2. I like PS2 cause it has more games. I like the Xbox because it has better quality graphics,almost computer quality. If I was forced to own just one system. I'd probably go with PS2 ,because there's more games for that console,and it's very small now,and portable,It would easily fit in a backpack. But with HALO2 coming out I must keep my Xbox which is my personal "favourite" console system. But the PS2 "controller" is the best designed. All in all the new designed PS2 gets my thumbs up for quality and design. Get it if you can afford it. All three consoles have there pro's and cons. I'll leave it up to you to make your choice.	1
I have played Star Trek Elite Force and when I saw this game come out I thought it was going to be just another Elite Force. I was pleasantly surprised that the programmers have taken some care to put in elements in the game that really MAKE it a Star Trek experience. For example the Tricorder. When I play the game I actually spend most of the time using it. When I beam into a new site for the first time it is the first thing I am compelled to use.  The tricorder is important because it helps you locate objects you need and allows you to scan for shield modulation frequencies so that you can penetrate enemy shields- very important for your survival. Because of this the game creates an authentic Star Trek experience that Elite Force lacks- I felt like a starfleet officer doing things a starfleet officer would do! Elite Force on the otherhand made me feel like a Quake player running around in a Star Trek universe. The game is solidly built. Nice rendering. Projective shadows help add to the mood. Good music- but missing the original DS9 theme. No problem just swap their MP3 with the correct one :) The biggest thrill was running around Ops and the Promenade. It really gives you a new perspective on what DS9 was really like. (Make sure to look for the fish bowl on the promenade- a nice touch). The game is more difficult than I expected- even on the first level. I guess authenticity gets in the way sometimes. But fortunately cheats are well documented online- so no worries there. The only reason I give it a 4 out of 5 is that this is basically a Quake/UnReal game.	1
First off: I would like to give this game 3 and 1/2 stars but that is not possible. Its a pretty good game but it does have some negative characteristics. Pros:  The level designs were great, very pretty. You do get to explore DS9 itself. You get to run around inside the Defiant, which was pretty cool. The use of the Tricorder in the game was a neat idea. Modulating phasers; another cool idea. You have the option to play as one of 3 characters, each character has a different series of adventures. People and things "blows up real good"; nice damage effects. The game ran fine on my machine (I have a 3Dfx card). This is always a plus, ha-ha. Cons: Avery Brooks didn't supply his distinctive voice to the game. Too bad! In my opinion, some of the levels were too difficult at times. I spent too much time walking around in circles for no good reason. Some of the levels turned into "find the key" adventures. I'm tired of that little game plot device!	1
I love this game because you  have a story similar to Indiana Jones in a Star Trek mission. Searching for ancients orbs and following a legend. You can play three (independent) characters and save your progress in mission. You solve puzzles and kill "bad boys" and "creatures".  Wonderfull graphics and medium requeriments for your PC.  I gave 4 stars to overall rating because you will need to download two patches (first a big and after a small patch) for a good experience in this game.	1
I never new that this game even existed until I got it with star trek ds9 dominion wars, I got its jewel case so. The fallen is a puzzling, 3rd person mystery adventure good game. And it uses the glorious unreal tournament engine to pack in all the action to make in this game!!!It really has good graphics. Great gameplay. Good sounds, good music, Excellent graphics, oh and this is the first ut engine game to use projected volumetric shadows, but unlike in jk2(jediknigh2), it doesn't slow down the framerate!!!!But, there are some downs about it! One of the downs is the puzzling ALMOST impossible levels! Although the AI is normal, good. Fair enough! I reccomend a shiny NEW pentium 2 400mhrz with a 16mb 3d accelerator video card, the memory should not me shared and directly for it. I reccomend 128mb ram, that is required for most games these days, but for the really high tech ones, 256mb ram is reccomended. I also reccomend a high end good a3d directxcompatible or eax high end directx compatible sound card! And I reccomend 600mb of harddrive space for complete installation!!!And sci-fi star trek unreal fan is a must get this game! Just buy it! Enjoy it! I reccomend it! Your welcome!!!ps. I also reccomend directx7 of higher!!!!	1
I love this game its a little short but its great for any one who loves star trek	1
...and starting at the begining won't help much in this case.  I kept delaying reviewing "Evolution 2: Far Off Promise" because to put it frankly, I didn't know what to make of it!  I thought the first game was one of the best RPG's I've played because although the story wasn't as developed as some RPG's (Like "Final Fantasy," "Grandia," and "Skies of Arcadia!"), but the gameplay shined through and proved that gameplay DOES make a difference in a RPG!  And while the gameplay is improved (If not the same in some spots), and the story is better developed, there are some changes that MUST be delt with here!!!  First those annoying random dungens are gone.  Now this good because now you can make a maps, but it's also bad because if you play this enough times getting through the dungens won't be a challenge because there's nothing new here that you havn't seen before!  And just as a side note there are also secret doors in the dungens you can locate with the rumble pack!  Now as far as the charicters go, Sting didn't pull a "Squaresoft" and start with a new cast and because of this we now have Mag, Linear, Gre, Chain, and Pepper for a second time around!  And there's nothing wrong with that!  Graphics are of course great!  Now for some reason even though we have all these advanced stuff the game was strangly not as fun to play as the last one!  I don't know why but for some reason I just didn't find myself getting it this game as much as the last game!  I still recomend this game to anyone who liked the first one!  But since I still don't compleatly know what to make out of this then you be the judge on if this is better or not!	1
The story line: you are an expert safecracker, the best of your kind,  hired by Crabbe & Sons, the leading company in the field, to crack  their latest safe in less than 12 hours. Your reward: heavy financial  retribution, and perhaps... (no spoiler here :) You start by breaking  into the company (a nice old mansion in the London suburbs). From the  beginning sequence onward, you just crack safes all night. It can get  pretty addictive! My wife started cracking and couldn't stop until she was  over. The puzzles are varied, a mix of ingenuity, mathematical skills,  resourcefulness, and exploration (curiosity always rewarded). But you don't  need to be a genius: all the hints are scattered in the game. Look at all  the objects, take notes of the objects you cant't take with you, and walk  around until you are stuck. it's then time to think about what you have,  your next step, etc. The game is very well done, despite a couple of  bugs. the most annoying is actually common to other dreamcatcher games for  the MAC PowerBook: they don't handle the trackpad very well, and you can't  scroll your inventory (only beginning and end). Since it's in alphabetical  order, and Key comes about in the middle, it's most annoying. But I  discovered you can get around by clicking very shortly on the scroll  buttons (tapping is hopeless; it always takes you to the beginning or the  end). The game is not that short, and you'll need to take a few pauses,  and restart (unless you're a master safe cracker with an eagle eye). Most  useful is to find the map of the house at the beginning of the game. Avoids  to draw it by hand as you're walking along :) And since time is counted,  you might want to save after each safe, and restore from there once you  know how to crack the next one. Just avoids you to be short of time at the  end. We did it loosely and had plenty of time still left at the end. What  I liked best, is that you can guess. Even if you have not seen all the  clues, but guess how to crack the safe, you can go ahead. That means also  you can redo the game without looking for all the clues (in case you forgot  to save). And you can crack the final safe without having cracked all the  other ones. Actually, we never got around to crack the jackpot safe (it's  apparently random, and you can only try so many times). But we managed to  guess the missing letter anyway. And some of the safes are really darlings:  they'll make you laugh and feel good about yourself! It's a great game, a  great concept, and I'll definitely buy the sequel. So should you :)	1
This NES game is nothing like the movie.  You ride a skateboard through a street and dodge very deadly objects, such as soda cans, bannana peels, kidney beans, etc..  That's it... the whole game is you on a skateboard, a side-scrolling screen, trying to avoid objects being thrown at you.  Why are objects flying at you? who the ---- knows????	-1
Although this game is really old (for a video game anyway0 it still ensnares you with its simplicity, and its simple but addicting gameplay.  As you (or you and your friend, because it is two player) journey through a series of "caves" you blow bubbles that capture enemies, and pop them as well to advance to the next level.  There are over 100 hundred levels that come in different shapes and with different enemies as well.  I can honestly say that I can sit down and play this game for hours on end, and still be entertained FOREVER.  Bubble Bobble definately ranks high on my list of most entertaining games to play.  This one is a must get if you are afan of old school video games, it is a classic that entertaines the player very quickly and easily.	1
Do you like Paperboy, but hate the part of the game where you have to play as a paperboy? Then Back to the Future is the game for you!  Forget about a story line. You start as some guy (I assume Marty?) running down the street. You have to dodge hoola-hooping women, charging beefcake men, and bees (or maybe humming birds). Just like in the movie, you can grab a bowling ball and shoot these obstacles before they hit you! Occasionally you'll have a chance to grab a skateboard, but that just makes you crash quicker. Can you make it to the end of the block before 200 seconds runs out?  The only thing in the game that kinda ties it to the movie is a picture of Marty, his brother and his sister on the bottom of the screen, which fades away as time passes. Of course, I only know this because I've seen the movie, and it really looks more like a picture of George Washington, Jack White and Nosferatu with a bad toupe (now that'd be a great game!). You have to grab alarm clocks to keep it from fading, which makes perfect sense.  Let's say you make it through the five or so levels like this, which are all pretty much the same... It'll get you to Lou's Cafe (hey, something from the movie!), but that's when it gets even weirder. "Bullies to go!" it says as Marty walks in. He grabs someone from behind the counter and slides her down to the end of the room. Then it says "Boy, they sure threw you out in a hurry!" and you have to replay the last street level. Once you beat it, this happens again! And each time, you lose a life until it's game over! Is it even possible to make it past this part of the game? After several attempts, I've concluded that no, it is not possible.  If you want to flash back to a time when video games made no sense and slapped any random movie title on a cartridge so that it'd sell, then this is the game for you! But if you're looking for anything that has to do with Back to the Future - music, characters, story, a DeLorean - then you've come to the wrong place.  But of course, 1985 was a simpler time, where video games were usually one or two impossible levels that created endless frustration... and we liked it that way!	-1
The back to future game is very cool plus it a hard 2 find 1 it reminds me of the movie	1
If you're a TRUE fan of Back To The Future,you WILL like this game. Okay. I know some things in this game are not 100% based off the film,but it's still a really fun game to play. You play as Marty McFly! I mean,how cool is that? You can't do that in any of these newer games made today. Open you're mind,and realize that this game is good.	1
I'm 33, and at the moment have brought out my NES for my son(and for me)and now I'm grabbing all of my favorite games of my childhood, and among the many of them is "BTTF". The many negative reviews and other people saying "this game sucks",hated it for the simple fact of it's extreme difficulty. You have your basic simple premise to dodge bully's,hoola hoop girls, pits, and oil, ridiculous I know, but fun. The controls are basic and easy and are are smoothly done for it's time. At the end of a few blocks of skating,dodging and throwing bowling balls at your enemies, your first mission awaits, and it's the mini games that frustrate so many gamers, yes it's difficult and it can be done and therefore it has a good game-play value, not simply a game you beat and put in the dust-pile of old games. There's four mini-games(the cafe,the school of blocking hearts,the dance and the finale in the Delorion.) Maybe for me it's just the nostalgia factor but I'm playing this on break and still cant put it down. Your a true gamer if you beat this one.	1
Back to the Future is one of the more popular movie franchises in...the movie industry. The game based off of the movie.....was a bombshell. It isn't even based off of the movie, since there's barely anything that relates to it.  You play as a guy who's supposed to be Marty, but doesn't look like him. You walk through streets, collecting clocks and shooting bowling balls. That already sounds nothing like the movie. The music is as annoying as the game itself. It loops until you turn off the game.  There is this one scene, however, where you play the guitar (In an awkward way), and different music plays. However, it's not Johnny Be Good. Instead, it's a garbled 8-bit mess.  Could the game be any stupider? Yes, it can.	-1
LJN has a bad reputation of medicore or terrible games but they made some decent or good games but this is one of their worst yet to come.  Loosely based on the 1985 masterpiece "Back to the Future", it seems your in Hill Valley 1955 as you must try everything to collect clocks to save the time and your life from being erased from existence.  In this game everything is out to get you from bullies, girls with hula-hoops, men with glass plates, bees and darts. Here Marty is all dressed up in black like a punk instead of wearing his red jacket like in the movies and the music in this game loops over and over again like it makes you a bit crazy. There's some good things in the game that help fight enemies such as bowling balls you can use to throw at them and bad things like the skateboard which makes you go fast but you can't stop as this game goes in a bit of "Paperboy"-esque route of racing. There's even some hard mini-games which is a breath of air from the horrible music playing such as the hit the bullies game which you have to kill 60 of them with milkshakes, a game where you have to avoid being seen by Marty's past mother and the hardest one where you play at the high school prom.  All in all, it's a real piece of junk from LJN that should be avoided even if you are a fan of the movies.	-1
Even if this game costs a quarter, stay away!!  NES produces crappy games from exciting movies on purpose and LJN is guilty for that!  Its a cruel marketing tool to get kids to spend their hard earn money on crappy games!  I played it once on a website that allows you to play NES games and boy the controls suck!  Its horrible!!  Why?  I'll tell you!  -1 When did Marty sport a black shirt?  It wouldn't hurt if these game developers make it red! -2 Creativity is horrible!  Throwing milkshakes at bullies, dodging hulla hoop girls, park benches, bumble bees, clumsy moving crews holding pieces of glass (that you can't see until you knock into them).......what more can I say!!  What kind of deadline was LJN tryin to reach!  No excuse!! -3 Graphics were horrible (even for 1989 NES game)! -4 Music score was horrible (same song loops over and over and it wasn't even in the movie) -5 Overhead view of game in play gives me a headace and jump button is worthless if you can't jump over anything!  Like I said, controls are akward! -6 Ending is short and it sucks!  After all that work, trying to beat this difficult and horrible game, you get a crappy ending.  Many LJN games for NES have these so beware!  Don't buy this game!!  Also, stay away from the "Mario Bros" rip off sequel (II and III)!	-1
This game has nothing to do with the movie. The only thing famileur is the logo and the clock tower that arnt anything more then the start screens.  You run through the streets and have to collect a bunch of clocks while avoiding running into the hooler hoops girls and killer bee's and the ever so deadly park bench.  This game has nothing to do with the movie at all. It's more like a run and dodge 'em game like Frogger only on a scrolling screen that seem's to go absolutly no where.  The next game was a little better, but still only 1 stars, but least that game had the deloreon in it.	-1
Beyond awesome!	1
great game	1
ty :)	1
Great game.	1
Cartridge of the Game looks Awesome, it Plays Awesome & the Game is Awesome!, i actually got to the Boss in the game but he is Impossible to beat i'm gonna get my cousin to come over 1 day though so we can play it together and only then we might have a chance. Lol!	1
This is a fun one or two player game. the puzzles are fun and engaging. you will have hours of fun with this classic NES game.	1
Bubble Bobble is one of the only NES multiplayer games that lets both players play at the same time, and is actually playable. Most multiplayer NES games make you take turns and isn't really two player its just see who can get a higher score(like Super Mario Bros.). And most of the few that do have two player on screen support are unplayable(like Battletoads). Bubble Bobble has a fun Two player game mode that two normal people can actually beat. Highly recommend.	1
Bubble Bobble is a game in which you control two cute dinosaurs in a weird world. You must kill enemies by shooting bubbles at them (they end up inside the bubbles) and then pop them.  That became a huge and addicting experience in an 80s arcade game. What's even better was that you get to play with a friend and team up to progress through the game.  The NES version is no difference. The graphics, gameplay, and everything else are all the same as what you've seen or heard in the arcade game. Sure, the NES had its limits, but back then, and even today, it's a near-perfect port of a game that people will never stop playing for generations to come.	1
the instant my friend and i started playing! i love this game, and for any old school gamer out there, you MUST get this game... if you don't already have the game, that is!	1
There was a time, shortly after Enix released Dragon Warrior VII for PSX, that this game, with a major PlayStation facelift, ALMOST made it onto the newer system and into new gamers' game libraries.  I think it was released in Japan, but fate frowned on us and financial concerns led it to never reach the US. Who cares?  ME!!! :~-{ (my emoticon is trying to cry)  So many RPGs I play engross me, offer me many hours of fun and enjoyment, but fade from memory within weeks of completing them.  Not this one.  The story, the game's layout, the amazingly deep characters for this old an RPG, and Necrosaro all keep this game right up there with Lufia I and II and Final Fantasy IV and VIII and Xenogears and Chrono Trigger on my list of favorite RPGs of all time.  And I will never get to play it on a newer system.  :~-{ :~-{ :~-{ :~-{ :~-{ :~-{ :~-{ :~-{ I'll quit pouting long enough to remind myself - Eureka!  The NES version is still out there!  My NES long since kicked it, but if you have any, ANY means of playing this game do it.  It is one of the best ever made.  But never on PSX.  Back to the handkerchief. :~-{ :~-{ :~-{	1
As the title implies this is Enix at it's very best.  THe last Dragon Warrior game to appear on the NES and it goes out with a bang.  Lets start with the length of the game, 5 chapters, five stories all eventually intertwined.  A crew of 7 main characters, and at least 7 or more alternate/ incontrollable characters.  Literally over 50 or more hours of gameplay guarentee, and an incredible story that rivals even the Great Final Fantasy of today.  Obviously to a gamer who is just entering or was weened on the likes of Final Fantasy 7, 8, and 9 they might be disgusted by the repetitive level building, or need to actually search for a few things, or ancient graphics, but the masterful story will keep most in tuined.  In  fact if my memory serves me right ENIX is remaking this title for the PSX and plans to have it out before the sytem dies (They had an SNES remake but the system died before it was released).  If this game does return to Amercian shores it will be worth purchasing no matter what.  Own this, buy this, steal it, import it, it doesn't matter oen this title.  YOu will not be disapointed.  I still play it to this day (When my system works).	1
Here's a quick story.  It's rather sad I'm afraid.  Not sad as in tearful necessarily, but in a life-changing and tragic kind of way.  When I was a kid in the late 80's my mom took me to either Sears or Woolworth in Delaware so we could purchase a video game.  At the time I thought Bionic Commando looked kind of cool from the little bit of information I knew about it based on gaming magazines and perhaps even word of mouth.  To my surprise the game was actually available so we purchased it, bring it home, I pop it into the NES... and it doesn't work.  All that appears is a black screen.  I had this same issue with another game at a yard sale called Marble Madness and when I took it back they allowed me to trade it for Robocop.  Good trade there, however...  Despite doing everything in my power to get Bionic Commando to work that one summer afternoon, it does not.  A brand new game popped in the NES but the black screen wouldn't go away no matter how hard I try.  When I take it back... I decide to get another game... and the game I get is Yoshi (a puzzle game).  No, not Yoshi's Cookie- just Yoshi.  A Tetris-like puzzle game.  I think this deserves a big "AHHH WHAT WAS I THINKING?!?!" moment!  Seriously, Yoshi instead of Bionic Commando?  *smacks self really hard*  Anyway, it's now a quarter of a century later and I'm getting to know Bionic Commando for real this time.  I'm actually rather surprised at a couple things.  First I thought the game was more open world than it really is.  The areas look much smaller now compared to 25 years ago obviously, but I really thought the levels were huge even back in the day.  The game doesn't really deliver much concerning a feeling of exploration, but what it DOES do exceptionally well is provide a slice of shooting, bionic arm swinging entertainment that made me realize why I wanted this game so much back in the day- it's unique.  Swinging from platform to platform instead of jumping on them like in every other game was an original idea that undoubtedly influenced Nintendo to create the same concept with the grapple hook in Super Metroid a few years later.  Simply put, swinging from your bionic arm all over the place (at fairly good speed too, which is another surprise) and shooting the bad guys is absolutely fun.  There's a LOT of strategy involved in finding the right ways to swing your bionic arm.  Sometimes the path isn't always clear whether it be up, down left or right which requires the player to give the game a strategic approach in order to succeed.  You have to look thoroughly at your surroundings sometimes and be a little creative in order to get around.  This isn't always easy however, since even when you do eventually find the right way to travel there's a severe threat of danger around many corners (usually gunfire).  Be alert when you play this game.  At least you're given up to 6 hits (the green bars you see in the top left corner) before you lose a life.  Each hit takes away one bar. Your life bar builds slowly throughout the game.  Also ALWAYS collect the 1-ups for goodness sake!  They help a lot.  Also notable is that there's other games such as a top/down view involving your character moving upwards towards the destination shooting everyone in sight (this one's fun but somewhat repetitive since it's frequent and doesn't offer much in the way of variety), the ability to choose where you want to go on the map screen, and the many battles with the superweapon which is basically the games occasional boss fight.  The battle is always the same however the danger surrounding it increases and changes as you progress, as does the challenge level, so these fights don't feel repetitive at all.  And I absolutely LOVE the melodic heroic music that makes up many of the theme songs.  Okay so the bionic arm swinging concept wasn't fully utilized or maybe it was and the limited space of the NES cartridge assured the game had to be short, but who cares seriously.  This game's awesome and just downright fun to play.  The storyline that involves saving a commando is memorable since the characters in this game are actually full of personality which isn't something I can say about most NES games.  The text is readable and memorable too.  I highly recommend picking this game up.  It's better than Yoshi, haha!  Oh and before I forget to mention it- if you like this game, I seriously recommend another NES title called P.O.W. (Prisoners of War).  While that game is significantly easier than Bionic Commando and doesn't contain as much exploration (or the bionic arm) it's equally fun and satisfies your desire for gun shooting action and adventure in the same way as Bionic Commando.	1
This game is a very special game to me, it got me into classic gaming and it was also the first NES game I really got into. This game is so unique in terms of mechanics and style. Instead of most platformers where jumping and running is the main focus of the game, Bionic Commando flips that on its head. in this game you cannot jump at all. But you have a super cool bionic arm that has a grappling hook attatched to it, so to get yourself around the levels, you need to swing from platform to platform. The level designs are mostly excellent and takes full advantage of the bionic arm. One thing I love about this game is that your character has a lot of weight to him, he doesnt really move fluently on the ground, but when you swing it is more efficient and faster than walking around, I love this, it encourages you to use the arm in creative ways and fully master it. While I love this game, it has its fair share of flaws, the boss battles are pointless. If you really know this game, you know the many ways to defeat or for the most part completely skip a boss and go for destroying the generator instead of actually fighting them, while I think its cool, I still wish the bosses were more interesting and varied, THAT was fixed in Rearmed though. Also the weapons....they could be better, the game offers different weapons every time you defeat a boss, while the weapons are pretty good, there is no way to switch between them in game, so the weapon I stuck with throughout the entire game was the rocket launcher, because that thing is uber powerful. But those are my only flaws with this game. This is my favorite NES game of all time, any fan of oldschool platformers who are looking for something different should give this game a try. Plus the remake rearmed is AMAZING, so you should pick that one up too.	1
I played this game when I was a young boy, and I am very exited to play with my children some day. Because I know that games like these help with eye and hand coordination and its a fun game that everyone can pick up at any age.	1
If I were to rate every video game I have ever played in terms of how advanced it was for ITS OWN TIME, this one certainly would rank in the top 10, maybe even the top 5.  These days, I have a PS3, along with several old systems like the original NES, Sega Genesis, and N64.  Sure, the PS3 games obviously crush all the games from the other systems in terms of graphics and depth.  But still, the one game I still enjoy playing just as much as all the new games, is the old NES version of Bionic Commando.  For 1988, this was one heck of an advanced game.  I just remember being 12 years old and spending hours and hours with my friend who owned this game back then, trying so hard to solve it.  We eventually did, but it took alot of work, and all in one sitting, because you could not save and start at a later time at the same point in the game (like Zelda and a few others of the day).  Nope, you had to go start to finish, but you could however collect an unlimited number of continues along the way if you knew what to do...and boy will you need them, especially when trying to get past areas 6, 11, and 12!  Obviously, it has great graphics for its time, but there is so much more.  For one, the game is non-linear, you can hop around to different levels and play them (to a degree) in whatever order you like, so long as you have found the proper radio communicator for that level (there are 4 different ones).  There are tons of special weapons and items to collect along the way, and you have to learn when to use which ones on which levels (you can only bring one gun, one communicator, one special item, and one protective item with you).  There is the rifle, rocket launcher, wide cannon, three-way gun, and machine gun...there are 4 different communicators, alpha (red), beta (green), gamma (blue), and delta (yellow)...there is the pendant, the helmet, and the bullet proof vest to help protect you...there are special items like the flares, energy restoring pills, the rapid fire device, and the iron boots.  Quite complex features for 1988.  The game is also great for its backstory, cool looking scenes, complexity of levels, and cool background music.  You are a highly trained commando, sent to rescue Super Joe, another commando who has been captured by the enemy!  This enemy (who is supposed to resemble the Nazis) is out to take over the world with their superweapon and you must stop them!  They are also trying to resurrect from the dead, their former leader (Master-D) to help them activate this weapon (and he has a coincidentally similar appearance to none other than Adolf Hitler).  You have to navigate through enemy bases, forests, seaside ports, neutral areas where you may not fire your weapons, underground sewers, bunkers, and factories to make your way there.  You will fight everything from common soldiers with rifles, to grenadiers, to one man mini-helecopters and tanks, to platoons of attacking soldiers, to enemy bionic commandos, to huge robot warriors, and much more.  And best of all is the bionic arm...you cannot jump, so instead you use this arm to grapple and swing your way over obstacles and deadly terrain.  Sounds hard, right?  Well it is!  But you will get used to it, and actually will come to appreciate what you can accomplish with it!  If you had this game as a kid, buy it and bring back some great memories.  If you did not, buy it and try out one of the great all time classics!  Hours upon hours of highly addictive fun!	1
When you think of great games for the 8 bit nes, people think of Super Mario Bros, Contra, Metroid, Punch out, Rygar etc. Bionic Commando probably isn't on everyone's list but that would be attributed to not having played the game!  I actually got this game by default for my birthday b/c Punch Out was sold out at three separate stores. Seeing that my dad probably didn't want to drive all over town to find Punch-Out, I got bionic commando as a kid merely basing my choice on the cool looking cover (a guy with a bionic hand while holding a bad ass gun in his other).  The gameplay is interesting. You can select certain levels instead of being forced to in a sequence. One noticeable difference and good change of pace from all games is that your character cannot jump (only walk back and forth). You utilize, yes you guessed it, your bionic hand to swing from wall to wall to get around. It's a very clever idea to say the least.  Overall, it's a great game.	1
Forget the 2009 remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Bionic-Commando/dp/B000ZK9QFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Bionic Commando</a>, this is the real deal. Bionic Commando for the NES is an excellent game with some inventive 8-bit gameplay mechanics. The story is simple - it follows Radd Spencer as he goes to rescue Super Joe, another commando who was captured by bad guys. Radd is equipped with numerous weapons and a bionic arm to help him rescue Joe and defeat the bad guys. A short and sweet NES backstory in the vein of good ol'&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Contra/dp/B0009VRFFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Contra</a>.  The game is unique in the fact that you cannot jump. Huh? You have to be able to jump to get around the levels right? Not necessarily. In Bionic Commando, your bionic arm acts like a grappling hook and you use it to climb platforms, swing across spike and fire pits, and to pull down out of reach enemies. It's an interesting game dynamic, and at a time when every other game character could jump, it was almost revolutionary. The available weapons are standard; you've got a rifle, a wide gun, a 3-way gun, a rocket launcher, and a bazooka. I think the rocket launcher is the best choice for almost every level. There are also a bunch of items you can find, but none of them are that effective except for the bullet proof vest.  The map screen is also interesting. Instead of progressing linearly to the next level, you're in a helicopter and can choose what area you want to go to next, occasionally running into enemy forces and battling them in between levels. It is an original concept that was refreshing at a time when most games went straight from point A to point B. The game is bright and colorful as well, with each level having a different color scheme and enemies. The enemies vary from soldiers with guns and enemy bionic commandos to sentient slime and giant supercomputers. The human enemies you kill drop bullets, which when enough are collected, your life bar extends one point. You start with three energy points and can work your way to a total of eight.  The controls are tight and work surprisingly well. Using the arm takes some getting used to, but the game takes that into consideration by making each level depend more on the bionic arm as you progress. By the time you get to Levels 11 and 12, you'll be a master at swinging, grappling, and landing.  All in all, a really good addition to the NES library that has some unique 8-bit innovations and is a lot of fun to play. A must own for anyone with a Nintendo.	1
Bionic Commando is one of the greatest NES games. The graphics and sound are good. The gameplay is unique because you do not jump. Instead, you use your arm to grapple and move across a place. There are enemies that move about on the map. Overall, this game is pretty hard. However, that is a small flaw to this great game.	1
Let me first say, I grew up with this game and may be biased, but I really like this game.  It's a fun and fast paced shooter for the NES. It's not a huge game, and can be beaten within an hour, but it requires some coordination and practice.  Pros: 1. Exciting and fast-moving gameplay 2. Cool power ups 3. Music is great! 4. Easy game to "pick up and play" 5. Level variety (supply drops, search and destroy missions, rescue missions, etc.) keep the simple gameplay interesting.  Cons: 1. Length is a tad short 2. Very easy to accumulate maximum power ups quickly (could be considered a pro by some) 3. While the music is great, I think there should have been music in the actual levels, all you get is a jet engine sound and shooting sound effects. This is really my main complaint about the game, especially since the title screen/game over/space station music is all pretty rad. 4. Would have been nice to have a plot background in the opening credits, as you kind of just jump in to the game without knowing what's going on.  All in all, a good game.  And with this game being so dirt cheap, I would say there's no excuse for it not to be a part of an NES enthusiast's collection!	1
I'm not saying that this game inspired Starfox, but chances are pretty good that it did. Like in Starfox, your flying vehicle is made up of polygons. Where Starfox has R-wings, this game has an F-14. There is a nice variety of levels, ranging from slow-paced scroll-and-shoot, to high speed chases among polygonal mountains, to supply-dropping missions, to behind-the-shoulders shooting, tricky landing sequences, etc. Your craft can turn left, right, increase and decrease altitude. The weapon selection is nice, but the price you pay for that are some sometimes clunky controls. Tap a button once for this attack, but Press a button once for this one. There are some cheats for this game, but I've never gotten any of them to work. A controller with Turbo-fire comes in handy, but watch out on the last battle, or you'll shoot past the ending!	1
6/11: If you were to conduct a survey and try to find out the top ten hardest NES games, you will invariably see Fester's Quest in there. Yes, its reputation for being notoriously difficult to play is much richly deserved. Some have said that it is a straight rip-off from another game made by Sunsoft called Master Blaster. Quite frankly, I just don't see it. Fester's Quest is in a class of its own for different reasons. I am not going to say that it is a good game to play because it is not. For most part, I feel the difficulty of the game is attributed to bad programming. One thing is for sure: there are no passwords, making it a very arduous and draining game to play because once Fester dies, he will have to start all over again from square one. He can be hit by anyone, and it only takes two hit points to die. The maximum is four, if two health bars are found, which is nearly not enough. At least, the programmers had the decency not to take away my inventory and also force me to go through the bosses all over again (thank you...because if that is going to be the case, I guarantee you that Fester's Quest deserves the number one or two spot for being the hardest NES game ever made). Two, the problem with gun upgrades, it's impossible to go from level 8 to 7 (or 6, 5) and then back to 8. So, what do you do when this happens? You need to downgrade (yes...purposely downgrade) the level of the gun to level 4 before rebuilding it back up because you won't see a blue gun upgrade ever again in the game until you do this method. It takes a good ten to fifteen minutes of killing off the spawned green balls in areas 1 to 5 or green crowns in the spaceship area to pick up the downgrades and upgrades. So, it is absolutely imperative that once you have level 8 gun and level 4 whip, do not ever touch the red ones in the entire game; do not even think about going crazy with the whip. Most of my time playing Fester's Quest was wasted due to restarts, walking from square one to back to where I died (I must have done it like dozens times including going from square one to the spaceship about five times), and gun downgrade snafu. Ok, I am going to give some strategies in each area and how to beat it as I beat Fester's Quest without a game genie which took me roughly 9 hours to accomplish in one sitting with a normal NES controller. Yes, the game takes a great deal of concentration and energy out of you. That's why it is one of the hardest games in NES history. Area 1: A word of warning, you may notice that Fester, if he is hit, will walk extremely slow. A lot of players is misunderstood, after the moment it happens, that's how the entire game will be like, and then they will proceed to turn off the power. To solve the problem, you need to go to menu and select Vice Grips and then press A in the game to enable it. Now, Fester can move fast. If you have no Vice Grips from beginning, it's best to restart it and make sure to never get hit again until you reach the second house where Wednesday is in to get them. Anyway, to start the game off, it's imperative to build your gun up to level 8 before going to first boss. The whip (an extremely important item to have) won't come until Area 2. I just find Area 1 very straightforward. The Area Boss is pretty easy to defeat if you move around it in circles and setting off the TNTs as it goes from left to right and vice versa while avoiding the whips. You will find yourself going through Area 1 all the time, so make a habit of going to every house to pick up the TNTs, Vice Grips, Potions, and Invisibility. Area 2: Make sure to pick up the whip and start upping it to level 4. Now, a word of warning: DO NOT GO CRAZY WITH IT. Just take your time with it, and if in doubt, use the gun very often. Otherwise, be prepared to farm for gun downgrades and then upgrades for a good ten to fifteen minutes. Of all bosses, Area 2 Boss is the toughest. So how to beat it: when the Boss throws the whip on one side, get over to there immediately and use the missiles until it's gone. For example, if you are moving to left side and the Boss throws a whip on the opposite of your direction, immediately turn around until you are where the whip was previously thrown. Then, use level 4 whip and whip the Boss. It will take a good twenty or so hits to beat it (not an easy task). Use your instincts to when to use the Invisibility, and go to the Boss and whip it as fast as you can before giving up to avoid any hits. When you are low in health (preferably one hit point left), use Potions. Area 3: Make a habit of picking up the Missiles every time. The Knight Boss is easier this time. He is just too slow, so use the missiles and move around a lot. When you are all out of missiles, use the level 4 whip and Invisibility. When you are low in health (preferably one hit point left), use Potions. Area 4: Thankfully, the shortest area of the game. The Boss is easy as well. Just watch his jump before he begins to shoot three bullets in a predictable angular fashion. So, just get in between the gaps and use the missiles. Make sure to move from left to right and vice versa in a small segment of path. There is no reason to go all the way to one side and also the other side. When you are all out of missiles, use the level 4 whip and Invisibility. When you are low in health (preferably one hit point left), use Potions. Area 5: Finally, we get Nooses, arguably the best item of the game, but sadly, it's not allowed in fights with Bosses. You may use all Nooses as you like prior to fight with next Boss, but when you have defeated all of the Bosses and have to start all over again by walking from square one to Spaceship, don't ever use any of the Nooses. In fact, don't ever waste any Missile, Potion (one is okay, but that's it), and Invisibility until you get inside the spaceship. Once inside, it is okay to use Potions, but nothing else. I demand you to have at least 3 Potions, exactly 5 Invisibility, and exactly 20 Missiles during the Final Boss of Spaceship Area. You must have 15 Nooses inside of Spaceship Area, no exceptions. If you feel that you are in a serious shortage of any, well...all I can say is: Good Luck and enjoy your walking all over again. The Boss is easy because it's the same as before yet with an additional feature. Like before, find your gaps and use missiles when ready. Just keep walking left to right and vice versa. When you are all out of missiles, use the level 4 whip and Invisibility. When you are low in health (preferably one hit point left), use Potions. Spaceship: Be absolutely sure to have gun at level 8 and whip at level 4. The whip is more important than the gun anyway. If you find yours low in any, it's fine. Just go to the hallway where you see the green crowns and use the gun to farm them all until you are properly geared. A word of advice: I do not recommend ever using the Nooses on the Eyeballs. You can easily kill them with level 4 whip. Just time it perfectly to get them as soon as it lands. Don't even think about using the gun on them either because you will get them all mad and they will all come at you mad hopping. The only times you will use the Noose are when you see the big monsters with flying arms, the wheelie bugs with bright green mass in center, and the huge green robots. Going from start to finish in Spaceship Area, there is enough of Nooses to take care of them all with probably two to three leftover. So, it's pretty easy actually. Final Boss: Probably the easiest of all Bosses, as soon as the fight begins, use the Invisibility and start whipping (level 4 is a must) at the machine gun box as fast as you can until it dies. Every time your invisibility runs out, keep using another and use Potion as soon as you have one hit point left. Move over to the other machine gun box to take it out in the same way as before. When both boxes finally are destroyed, walk to the farthest right side. Now, you are completely 100% safe from being hit. Now, time to use all of the missiles. Notice that the targets will be on two boxes and the center mass of the organism. Switch around the target until it's at the center mass, and unleash it. You will beat the game when you take your time with the missiles. Like I said before, it's very imperative to have 5 Invisibility and at least 3 Potions to beat this Boss.  The ending is garbage, but the game is garbage anyway. All in all, Fester's Quest is not an easy game, and after beating it, I don't feel like playing it ever again in my life.	1
this is based on the addams family i like the gun you get you can actually power it up the gun looks more like a space gun you collect other things along the way from different members of the addams family i only one thing i didn't like about it is that you have to go through a maze to get to a boss hat took some trial & error i maped out the areas in 5 locations you may want to do that so you don't get stuck & when you reached the UFO you won't feel as lost as you figh your way through aliens & beat the final boss it's easy to destroy once you take out the 2 guns & then walk to the right side of the screen firing homing missles at a safe distance	1
Fun game to get back into. Loved this old nes game when I was,a little kid in the early 1980s	1
I guess its a great game if I only know what I am suppost to do lol. you really should give it a try	1
Have you ever wondered why they didn't do an Uncle Fester spin-off movie where he fights aliens in a neighborhood? Guess they couldn't talk Hollywood into that no-brainer, so it must have gotten bumped down to the video game world. Hopefully Cousin It's Barber School Adventure is up next!  This is one of those games that makes you wonder about the video game industry back in the day. Would they just greenlight anything that had a semi-recognizable name on it? Apparently yes. Or at least they'd take some crappy game and slap a name on it, because this clearly has no ties to the world of The Adams Family beyond the title.  But let's put the story flaws aside and focus on the fact that the game is impossible to play. Fester only gets two life bars, which go fast when his laser gun (he has a laser gun) proves relatively ineffective on the aliens. You can shoot the non-moving ones four or five times to get an item, but even with upgrades I was unable to kill the jumping aliens (which look suspiciously like the Legend of Zelda jumping creatures). Each venture into the world lasted a minute or two, and once you die the game is over and you start again.  Pressing pause only brings up further questions. You can select between a gun and a whip for a weapon, but I couldn't figure out how to change it. There are various items you can collect, including keys and money, but I never got anywhere that they could be used.  As far as I can tell, this game is impossible to play... forget about playing through to the end, because even surviving five minutes seems like a grand achievement. Does Fester even have a quest beyond survival?  This game ranks up there with Back to the Future and Karate Kid as one of the worst movie tie-ins ever. I mean, come on!	-1
It works great!	1
This controller the bittons had to be mashed so hard it hurt.... which isn't possible when playing something like the mario games	-1
ok	1
Works but came to me dirty and some of the rubber components had to be replaced not thrilled but the controller is old	1
Great buy! Would highly recommend this seller! : )	1
Thank you, the one i recieved was in great shap and works just as well as i remember.	1
Fantastic, authentic, original, high quality controller (with official Nintendo logo) in very good condition. Plays games better than I remembered!  CAUTION: If you want an authentic controller, don't just click and buy this product. You need to look at the available used listed items and check for an authentic quality controller from one of the specific sellers. Be warned also, each seller may have different return policies.  I selected a used controller in collectible quality condition that had pictures of the actual item posted by the seller and said they were authentic original controllers. It cost me about $6.50 and I got exactly what I wanted.	1
The A and the B button are wired correctly. 10/10	1
Solid and fairly clean. Works like the day it was manufactured.	1
The controller is in very good condition but the Start button needs to be pressed harder than the other buttons,, that is the reason for the 4 star rating, I recommend this seller.	1
In very good condition as stated!	1
Much better than a generic brand. Coloring is a little off but works perfectly	1
Couldn't beat the price, and received a near mint condition original NES controller.	1
Great product! Brings back great memories.	1
I usually raise a few eyebrows among fellow NES enthusiasts when I reveal that I do not have this game in my library.  The truth is that I wouldn't have it in my house. (EDIT: I do now)  On its face, it looks like a great game.  I enjoyed the graphics and sound the first time I fired it up years ago.  The story was fun and silly, and there was plenty of humor in the level design & characters' super-hits.  Then I reached the third level, and the difficulty just shot through the roof.  Perhaps the most telling event was when I attempted to leap the first of the lava pits.  I lined myself up at the edge of the platform, leapt...and passed right through the far bank.  I lost several lives before I realized you have to line yourself up in the MIDDLE of the platform, a substantial distance back.  The game is loaded with counterintuitive occurrences like this one.  I reached the conclusion that Battletoads isn't really a game.  It's a sequence of button-presses you must execute in a specific order.  You don't PLAY Battletoads, you memorize the sequences, much like those Sega CD games where you just match the on-screen controller directions while stuff happens in the background.  For example, the speeder-bike level is actually harder if you look at the screen.  The best way to play it is to make notes on where the walls appear and look at those, with only occasional glances at the screen to check your position.  Worst of all, there are a limited amount of continues, which is completely unforgivable in a game demanding so much trial and error.  Subsequent levels are worse, the Snake Pit being my least favorite.  I think I only ever beat the speeder-bike level once as a child, then died within seconds of beginning the following ice cavern.  And I'm a player who can beat Contra with one life.  I went back years later and beat the game using an emulator to save states, and you know what?  I still didn't enjoy it.  It's just not a very good game.  I prefer to look at the screen when I play.  EDIT: I finally purchased a copy and a game genie, sat down and practiced each level, and legitimately beat the game.  No game genie, no warps, no codes.  Having seen all the game has to offer, I changed my score from 2 to 4 stars.  5 for the ingenious level designs and more variety in gameplay than some games that are released today, -2 for the ridiculously broken challenge (I can beat the game; I think I now get to call the challenge broken!), and +1 for the fact that its stupid impossible difficulty has made it an endure for decades after its release.	1
Once consider the eigth hardest game at the time of it's release on the original NES consule. Here is a walkthrough of boss static damage resitance and moves and other stats and tips. You don't want these statics close the web page now if you want to discovere these statics yourself. The first boss this guy gut to using wraps to skip some of earlier leavel does not have a very good attack strategy if you are experience our are using cheats. He just jump around and fire bullets at you kind of like bubble man in Megaman 2. Hit him with about 22 times the boss will go down The next boss who  he fights looks a ombination of Rockstead and a rock solider from the nija turtles early series has a damage resitance strength of about 24% damage resitance. For the fnal boss the black queen hit her with 22 air kick atack see goes down. The vortex boss before  her has about 3/4 of this damge resitnace strength this for the vortex like booss.  This kid skipped some level so there might be other bosses that you may have to figure out the statistic on your own have a nice day and may the toad be with you. Her is the damage static for the second boss on battle toads arade game.  It is enormous  snake will kill you wih one bit if you don't have infinite health on doging its  strike and hit in with 32 attacks and this boss goes down like the shark in jaws. Anybody got snakeskin boats in a size 12! The robot mouse boss is a beheanath this boss takes had a riduculous high 63% damage resitance  the strongest boss in the game until the giastic robot final boss at the very. Also to inform you some of normmal enemies get beffer after this especially the two musuclar mouse enormous mouse badguys.  The next boss is a giant some what muscular mouse who has the ability to enlarge him him self to to hugemous size and mass about equvalent of maybe 1000 wreasler maybe more. Hit him a few times and he will shrink back down as he jumps and slams the ground in his bigger form. Regradeless of his size 24 hit total when he is both sizes and he goes down!  She you next fall Jerry. You will reach the final boss hit who has defrense strength than super shreder on Hard mode. Hit with 190  multil shot flame throw blast in the head and arm this super high stamina boss goes down you have beaten this game if you have enough credits or infinite credits to survive long enough to bring it down. Cheas I higly recommend due to high boss damage resitance and speed and attack status. I have just one thing to say toads rule!	1
love it work really good	1
Works fine. Very fast shipping.	1
Out of the 3 NES Double Dragon games, I think those of us who played all 3 and weren't just stuck with owning one of the 3 back in the day would probably overall agree Double Dragon II is the best of the series. Double Dragon 1 was tough, but fine, Double Dragon II was just about perfect, and when we heard DDIII was about to come out, anticipation was at a high to play it.  However what most of us found was a game not equal to DDI or II. I think like many at first who played this after the first 2, wondered why the heck the game was so hard and lacked options to make it easier. Both the original games started off on the street, this one starts in  a Dojo... okay, maybe they wanted to try something new, but it seemed to be wrong from the start. Straight away you start off against 1 opponent, once you beat them you have to go talk to a friend dieing on the side of the screen who tells you he tried to stop the new bad guys, but he couldn't, and the main person to beat is... that's what it says, "is..." leaving it like a mystery as he dies. I guess that would be fine, but it's the way its shown... DD1 has a cut scene of Marian being kidnapped before you play, DDII explains it in the intro that you can skip, but in DDIII you have to wait a few seconds for this on screen dialog/talk to hurry up and finish before you can resume, and that is just an annoying step backwards.  Next up you find your moves you got used to from DDI or DDII are again something different. I used to think the only way to improve DDII would be to have included the ground punches and head-butt moves back into the game. Now DDIII has a few familiar moves, but lacks in them. In Double Dragon II you relied a lot on your jumping 360 kick that you could preform from the jumping up or down, or jumping to the left and right, in Double Dragon III you can only perform it by jumping up and down, you can not execute the move jumping in either direction, which is a shame. Also needed was the return of the jumping-power-knee and super-uppercuts from DDII, but they are sorely missed in DDIII... even the reverse elbow smash from DDI would have been a nice addition.  So what has been added to the 3rd one, move wise? Apart from regular kicks and punches, the only returning move is the jumping 360 kick, which you can not do jumping left or right now. A run feature has been included and a move where you can jump and flip over your opponent, grab their hair and throw them across the screen... you can also now do a move where if you run at a wall, you can bounce off the wall with a super flying kick, which is a decent move if you can do it.. and there is also a couple of double-team moves for 2 players; one is a flying kick your partner helps throw you in, and the other is a joined hand dancing spin kick fest that is probably the best move in the game, but can only be done in 2 player mode... Double Dragon 3 really had lacked in quality from the other Double Dragon games as being a great game on 2 player, or single play.  It almost seems like this game was being designed, and new ideas where just not working; so instead of scrapping the game or improving what flaws it had to be a great game, they released a demo and forgot to tell people to send in their thoughts to help improve the game. Even in the 2 player intro screens, the game says the two heroes are Billy & Bimmy Lee... Bimmy? A spelling error like that in a NES game? Or maybe it is correct, maybe Jimmy Lee refused to be in this sarky game,  so ACCLAME asked their retarded cousin Bimmy to be in it instead? The other thing that bugs me is your enemies are not supposed to be Shadow Warriors from the previous Double Dragons... then why does Linda, Williams and whatever other enemies make a return?  What makes this game harder from the previous DD games is the lack of options, there simply isn't any. You can make the game even harder by selecting 2 player B and beating up player two so you can solo play against twice as many enemies... but if you wanna make the game easier, you will need a pro-action-replay or something to help you cheat.  The biggest issue with this version is extra lives... there isn't any! You get 1 life... you die, you're out! Do not pass go, do not collect 2up hundred dollars... nope, you're screwed. If you can manage to beat two other character in the game, some slow and fat ninja guy and a samurai, these guys will become your extra life. You can choose to select these guys by pressing select and choosing them to take over, or if you die as who you are in the game, one of these guys will take over as your main character... what I do not get is why the heck couldn't Jimmy be selectable in a 1 player game as your back up life? There is a little trick you can do to make that so, what you do is start the game on 2 player B and beat up Jimmy, or should I say, the retarded cousin of the Lee brothers, Bimmy, who accidentally misspells his own name on the game-play screen as Jimmy. Anyway, beat the first baddie, then beat up JimmBimm until your next hit will be the one that kills him. Then position him sort of in the middle of the room in a way that when you perform your jumping spinning 360 kick, he lands on the guy you have to talk to. If done right, Jimmy will activate him talking to you guys, instead of dieing. Then, make sure BillyBobJim doesn't die during the battle with the next few bad guys. Once the Dojo enemies are gone, have Jimmy exit the room first, then Billy. When you emerge from the room on the street, Jimmy will be gone, but if you press select, Jimmy is there as your 2nd option of character and your backup life.... however, don't use Jimmy till you have reached level two, as he will still have the ready to die energy he had from your beating until it regenerates in level two.  Now, as I was saying about the extra guys you can choose. They are useless, what moron thought it would be a good idea to allow you to use two extra characters that are just about useless? As boss enemies, they are decent, but to play as them is pretty weak, especially if you lose Billy/BimpDaddyJimbo and are stuck playing the rest of the game as one of these losers... as I did, getting stuck with the Samurai guy to finish the game off and yet somehow the dead Jimmy still gets the glory in the end.  So, I haven't said many positive things about the game yet... one option I do like is your option to swap characters during game play and have a special weapon you can choose to use at any time... however, unless you know how to rom hack like I did and add Jimmy as your second character by default play, and also have unlimited use of the special weapons... not to mention invincibility... then they are more something you have to plan and use strategies for when you are going to use them and how. Using cheats like that was the only way I could beat this game. Maybe you are good enough to do it without using any methods of cheats... but being someone who can beat Double Dragon II with my eyes closed and then coming into DDIII like someone who dies on the first goomba of Mario Bros, it really pi..cheesed... me off.  Once game play was over and done with, I was not impressed one little bit with the ending of the game. At least the first II Double Dragons showed something that made you feel like you had passed the game.. but this ones text "where are they now" screens really do show the lack of thought and imagination put into this game .."Billy & BJimmy rode off into the sunset to teach Kung Fu, while FuMan Chu and Tom Cruise become emperors of Kmart discounts" what kind of ending is that? No scenes, no decent ending, just a "what happened to them, bye" screen. I hate these games that are so hard to beat, and reward you with nothing once it's over. I suppose it's not quite nothing, nothing would be a single screen with no pictures saying, "thanks for playing, sorry you wasted so much time to see this text, bye". But this game here may as well have said just that.  So I guess that's why I don't particularly like DDIII. Not on the NES anyway... least the Arcade version was pretty decent and even allowed a 3rd player... but most importantly, had extra lives for as long as you could drop coins into it. And you know what the worse thing about it is? It's one of those rare times when you can truly say, even the Sega had a better version the NES. Sure the nes version isn't as bad as the GameGear version, but it's sad when even the GameBoy has a better version then the NES.  I think with the lack of effort put into the game, and it's terrible reward for beating the game, that is why it is so hard. The game makers don't want you to be able to beat it, so you can see just how unrewarding it is. At last moment before they decided to release it, like I was saying before about it being a demo... I really think game testers where thinking that the game is so bad, give people 1 life so they can't advance to the end and see just how sh/badly we have made this version, but because DDI & II sold so well, this one is guaranteed to make us a few bucks anyway, so just release it as it is now, no one will see the end of it anyway.	-1
That's right, folks! This is another beat-up-the-bad-guys-and-save-the-girl video game from the makers of. . . actually Technos made this game. I know next to nothing about Technos. Double Dragon is a game of three distinct trigger actions: jumping, punching, and kicking; and seeing as how the standard NES controller has only two trigger buttons, Tehcnos decided in part 3 (as with the previous games) to make jumping accessible by through pressing the both the punch and kick buttons simultaneously (there is lenience so both buttons do not need to be pressed at the exact same time). From a jump, you can perform one of three attacks as Billy or Jimmy: cyclone spin-kick (A or B), arial kick (left or right and B), or monkey-flip your opponent (left or right and A). When monkey-flipping your opponent, you somersaut over your opponent, grab his/her head or hair, and toss him/her through the air. This is especially fun when fighting on ledges -- just make sure you don't get too close and fall off, yourself. On the downside, there are no playable females (which seems to bother only myself). You can still fight against a few female thugs though. Another hex is the high level of difficulty that stems from the questionable play-control. For example, the first boss (who somehwat resembles the Jack of Hearts) has a long reach which makes him hard to hit and he often ducks when you try to whack him with your cyclone spin-kick, leaving you open for attack, thanks to a lagging recovery. You also cannot monkey-flip some enemies. As for Chin and Ranzou, these two have slightly different attack methods from the Double Dragons: Chin has a diving Kamikaze head-butt which is activated through jumping towards your an enemy and then pressing A. When your press A or B after jumping, he does some weird air dance that only attacks from one side. His weapon is the iron claw, similar to Vega from Street Fighter. Yagu Ranzou is (in my opinion) the best character. He uses a katana instead of his bare fists and he can use his other weapon 20 times (as opposed to Chin and the Lee brothers who can only use their's five). Ranzou's weapon is the shuriken (or flying ninja star). You can play as Chin and Ranzou only after you have beaten them. Billy and Jimmy's weapons are the nunchukues. Note: in case you buy this game used and without an instruction manual, you need to hold the Select button for two or three seconds during gameplay to activate the options menu for using your weapon and/or changing characters. Have fun.	-1
Join Billy and Jimmy in a similtaneous brawling on the streets game. This is the same game as ever, just with less graphics. They tried to incorporate a new idea to this game by having Billy and Jimmy on a quest around the world to find Billy's girlfriend Maria. The game gets very old quickly because of how long it is and the lack of enemy variety.	-1
This is one of the best looking games on the system with brilliantly detailed graphics, high speed, and nice parallax scrolling. Unfortunately, the gameplay doesn't hold up very well. This game is brutally and unfairly difficult. It is a side scrolling beat' em up similar to Double Dragon or Final Fight, though nowhere near as good as the ladder. The moves all work and some are quite funny to watch. However where the difficulty comes in is in two player. This is often considered to be almost unplayable, as there is one huge, unavoidable flaw- Friendly fire. Yes, you can actually damage your teammates. If you aren't careful then this could entirely break the game. While the graphics are nice and the control works, the difficulty alone and the broken nature of two-player mode make this one of my least favorite of the Rare's NES offerings.	-1
I have bought two of these with the standard (new) buy button, and both cases were eerily similar. I ordered this, expecting to get an original NES controller or at least a tolerable 3rd party controller. The NES knock-off controller that comes in the box looks fine at first glance. Pretty much indistinguishable from the real thing, visually, except a QC sticker on the back and the red-lettered Nintendo above the two face buttons is gone. However, when you pick up the controller, you start seeing the problem.  The first thing you'll notice is that the paddle is heinously lightweight. It's paper-light. If you put this down with any tension in the wire, or if you accidentally touch the wire, the controller will shoot like a rocket towards the console / floor. And you will be accidentally hitting the wire often, because the wire is several feet shorter than the original controller. That means you'll have to get creative on where you place it - no stashing it next to the TV, it's gonna have to stay near the console. And you are, too, while you're playing.  Now I can tolerate how it handles out of play just fine if it plays well. But this is where the generic is just shameful. The original NES controller had a very reasonable roll to the control pad, and some respectable size tolerances on the face buttons. The control pad, for starters, is way too sensitive on the diagonals. You cannot play Contra with this controller, because you will accidentally get up from the prone position with bullets at standing-chest-level on a regular basis. And it's just flat out uncomfortable anyways, being a very hard plastic that has a very sudden "give" to it, as opposed to the original, which was more gradual about the downpress motion. The start and select buttons are plastic instead of that rubberlike material, which makes them clicky and feel far less pleasant than the originals (I wonder if it'd be nice to have all the face buttons be rubber...). The red face buttons are loosely moulded and wobble quite fiercely, but besides the obnoxious rattling won't present any gameplay issues.  It's a terrible controller, only good if you need to have a quick Nintendo fix on a left-or-right only game and you just can't stand the thought of buying used. Otherwise, pass on it.	-1
OK the NES controller is a good controller just don't buy it off amazon. You can get it cheaper at your local video game store or Ebay. Also you don't have to wait for shipping trust me staring at a NES knowing you can't play it is painful.	-1
This is just a Tomee controller. When I first plugged it in to play the d-pad almost was completely unusable. After taking the controller apart and cleaning it a little bit, it started to work a little bit better.	-1
Is it just me, or is this game impossible to play? Unfortunately my Game Genie went missing about 15 years ago (and it didn't work in the top-loader anyway), so unless everybody else is just straight up better than me (a possibility), they've gotta be cheating.  I was lucky to get out of the first room (a challenge in itself), but even after I started to get a hang of it, I could still barely make my way into the first level. Is there more than one level? This is supposed to be a long game? How can anybody possibly know that?!?!  You get one life, and no continues. Yeah, I know, right? Enemies are tough and repetitive, and if you're lucky enough to make it on top of the building, they can easily knock you off and send you back to the start screen. Maybe it's easier with two players, but my second controller must be hidden with the Game Genie.  Whatever happened to making games that are fun to play? Forget about fun... how about playable? Let me play for more than ten minutes without screaming in endless frustration. Who are these impossible games made for? Suckers, I suppose. Chalk me up as one. Stupid Double Dragon...	-1
A friend gave me money to order this for him. I personally didn't like this game. It's the worst in the Double Dragon series.	-1
Battletoads 2 Stars - So much potential, but the difficulty really prevents most players from getting very far  Ah yes, "Battletoads".  In gaming culture, this game is home to one of THOSE levels.  You know, the kind that appeared impossible when you first played it, and then . . . after a broken controller and lots and lots of swear words and three hours later STILL appears impossible.  Then you YouTube the level, and like watching someone play Eddie Van Halen's Guitar Instrumental "Eruption", you see someone pass the level with (oh God) apparent ease!  These players must be cheating!  There are lots of levels like this in the NES catalogue.  "Adventure Island" 8-3.  "Ninja Gaiden" 6-2 and then the end bosses.  "The Legend of Zelda" Dungeon Six.  The Dam level on "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles".  (At least with TMNT at least the title of the level makes you feel like you're swearing which is probably pretty cool when you're twelve).  Pretty much the ENTIRETY of the nightmare that is "Ghost and Goblins".  Also "Silver Surfer".  Of course the level I am referring too is the speed bike level, which is the third one early on in the game.  "Battletoads" is one of those games that Tradewest, the developer, had crafted in hopes of turning into a TMNT type franchise.  Colorful characters, over the top villians (in this case a Darak Queen), and anthromorphic toads.  For early 1990s the concept fit right into popular culture.  There's only one problem.  The game is hard.  As hell.  Yes, you want challenges. But honestly, so many people stop at level 3 because they can't get past the friggin' stage.  And this was a game marketed for kids.  By the time you give up you're so beat and humiliated you don't want to see another battle toad as long as you live.  It's kind of hard to feel connected to a franchise when you can't even get past the third level.  What is so unfortunate is that beyond Level Three there are some intrinsically intriguing, well designed game play (the Surf level, the Elevator Shaft, the Dark Queen's Tower).  Unfortunately most people never saw that game play.  Then there is the Snake level, which is almost as insane as the speeder bike level.  Of course, there is a SECOND speeder bike level, and this time the stones you crash into are MOBILE!  An earlier reviewer said that "Battletoads" isn't a game, it's a sequence of memorized button sequences.  While that could be argued for a lot of games, it gets to the heart of the main problem with "Battletoads".  For a game primarily marketed for kids, the game is simply too difficult for its main audience, and for most other players as well.  Of course, TMNT had similiar difficulty issues, but that was already established.  Another rather famous attribute to this game is the co-op game play.  Although Nintendo has said in recent "Iwata Asks" interviews that they have been trying to get co-op gameplay in "Super Mario" titles since 1988 with "Super Mario Bros. 3", other developers were able to get co-op play without issue (this game, "Contra").  However, given how frustratingly difficult this game is, there is a gamebreaking bug which if you get to the Dark Queen's Tower with two players (which is highly improbable to begin with - you think the Speeder Bike level is hard with ONE player?  Try TWO!), apparently there is a game breaking bug that completely freezes the game.  That would be so rage inducing I'd probably just throw the NES out the window.  Tradewest who owned both franschises did a cross over title, having the "Battletoads" team up with "Double Dragon", another legendary video game franchise with the 1993 title "Battletoads & Double Dragon".  Although Tradewest owned the "Double Dragon" franchise back in the early 1990s they have since sold the tile..  Although a genuine cross over, the focus is largely on the "Battletoads" franchise.  There are also some inconsistencies between the "Double Dragon" canon proper and this title.  The game is also very difficult, just like the original "Battletoads", though thankfully there are no God-awful speeder stages or snake stages this time around.  Overall, decent game that is marred by its most famous attribute: its difficulty.  And the fact the difficult stages come so early on, it prevents most players from really seeing what the rest of the game has too offer.  The video game website IGN rated this title as the 76th greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time.  (For those looking for great unknown NES/Famicom games, you simply MUST play "Moon Crystal", a criminally unknown Famicom exclusive. The graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo "Ninja Gaiden", amazing music, in depth gameplay, and a fantastic storyline. Absolutely amazing! Had this been released in the US for the NES, I feel it would be as revered as the other heavy hitters in the NES canon)	-1
Definitely the very WORST in the series.  This title comes with the Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection for PS3.  As great a collection as it is, this game should never be a part of the Metal Gear canon.  The overall level design strategy is god-AWFUL.  I didn't find the gameplay too challenging, but I threw in the towel when I had to fight the tank in the desert.  Apparently, the only weapon that can destroy the tank are mines.  I had 10 mines on me, and they weren't enough to take it down.  You REALLY think I'm going to go back through allllll those rooms and look for a supply of mines??  You gotta be kidding me!  They could at least have some mines to raid out of a truck at least 2 or 3 screens away!  But nooo....  The best part is that mines are the ONLY weapon that could do damage to the tank.  Grenade launcher?  Nope.  Remote-controlled rockets?  NOPE....not even those damage the tank.  You would think that the people who developed this game could reasonably assume that other heavy-duty weapons other than mines would damage a tank.  I'll say this....if Hideo Kojima had ANY part to play in this game at all, he really should be ashamed of himself.	-1
This is probably the hardest game I have played & most tedious. I'm a fan of the Metal Gear series I prefer Metal Gear Solid for the ps1 over this,  but with that being said this is an ok game that is CHALLENGING & has a super long password for each time you get a new item so you better break out a lot of paper lol. Metal Gear for the NES is probably not for everyone,  but if ur a fan of the series & happpen to pick this up cheep it make a good addition as a novelty item in a collection that has a bit of nostalgic feel.	-1
First of all I would like to know,just why in the hell is Kyle Reese on the cover of this game?? I swear to God,the very first time I've ever seen this game in the video store back in the day,I could have swore that this was based off a movie and Michael Biehn was the lead character. Anyway,that aside..this game is an absolute and total nightmare!! Even Hideo Kojima himself,was ashamed of this monstrosity. This version was NOT how Kojima originally intended the game to be!! The gameplay is absolutley awful and the punishing difficulty,shows NO MERCY on you!! The graphics,music and sound effects are promising,but the horrid gameplay,the extreme hardness and the crappy controls,completely put those to none effect whatsoever. Overall,if you wanna enjoy the original "Metal Gear",how it was meant to be..then I recommend picking up "Metal Gear Solid 3:Substance" for PS2 instead,which includes the REAL original "Metal Gear",and not this lackluster insult to such a great iconic video game!!	-1
Hideo Kojima the creator of metal gear was NOT involved in making this version of metal gear! Check wikipedia if you are doubtful. This game was made by money grubbing game makers.  Unlike all other metal gear games this one isn't about trying to be stealthy. It's an imitation of a run n'shoot type game. I repeat the creator of metal gear was not even involved in this.

The Little Mermaid for the GB is a very average game. In this game, you go through sidescrolling levels with some up and down movement. You can use shells to open boxes and kill enemies. There are powerups that you can use to defeat enemies. You use bubbles to trap enemies in the game. It is extremely easy to beat. The graphics are pretty good for a Gameboy game. The sound effects are average with nothing special about them. This is a very mediocre game with nothing special or overly bad about it.	-1
Boring.  Gameplay uses non-intuitive, inconsistent rules.	-1
could not play on retro NES	-1
they said they tested their games before shipping but when i got the game it wouldnt play. i was so looking forward to playing it too :(	-1
didn't work at all. we tried eighty ways from sunday to get it to play but it would just do a weird little demo.	-1
I could not believe how terrible this game was. The controlls are sloppy and the gameplay is horrible. You cant do anything. If you pick up a weapon or something you cant do anything with it. Avoid this game!	-1
Adventure Island seems cute and innocent when you play it just to pass time. When you get the ambition to beat it, however, it reveals itself to be an exceptionally frustrating and unrewarding experience. A difficult game it is - and in a very bad, bad way. Released two years after Super Mario Bros., Adventure Island quite obviously apes after that game - 8 worlds, 4 levels each, recycled palettes, damsel in distress, big bad guy to defeat - and yet it lacks everything that made that game so enjoyable.  Master Higgins is the hero; a weird, chubby little man in a baseball hat and a grass skirt. He has to rescue his girlfriend Princess Leilani/Tina from the evil Witch Doctor. You know, I actually think the Witch Doctor on the cartridge is really cool. How deceptive. Everything about this game just feels... bland. And weird. Coyotes that appear when you jump over flowers and eggplants hidden in eggs are the least of the weirdness. Super Mario Bros had an imaginative setting as well as a host of imaginative characters, from the minions to the boss. This game seems to lack imagination; the enemies are everything from bats to octopi to frogs - that's right, frogs. And the in-game Witch Doctor just looks terrible; he seriously looks more like an out-of-shape wrestler than an anthropomorphic rhino, and it's a real shame.  The music isn't anything to shout about either. My favourite is the march tune that accompanies the wasteland levels, where an already difficult game becomes even more frustrating. The forest tune is also fascinatingly eerie. The rest is standard platform stuff. Not bad, but nothing that really stands out, either.  Now, I love a good challenge, but that's precisely what Adventure Island isn't. It's a bad challenge. What I mean is that you are not allowed to make one mistake, ever. Unless you're riding a skateboard, bumping into any hostile entity (be it snail, frog or bonfire) will kill you, end of story (and getting knocked off the skateboard usually hurls you into the path of an enemy). Your only weapon to begin with is an axe. If you manage to stay alive long enough, you may be able to upgrade to a fireball. You really want that, because Adventure Island is just full of enemies at almost every turn. However, when you die, you lose EVERYTHING. And not every level even has a weapon.  But of course that wouldn't be hard enough, now would it? There is a heartless energy bar that constantly depletes. If it runs out, you die, and it doesn't take long for it to run out. You constantly must mitigate this by collecting fruit scattered across the levels. However, in later and particularly sadistic levels, you must pass entire areas between the (admittedly merciful) checkpoints without obtaining any food at all! Consequently, you are practically forced to run rather irresponsibly through levels, as well as avoiding any enemy which you may (and most probably will) run into. This means that you must develop a habit of premature action, because it's usually too late to retaliate to danger by the time it rears its ugly head. The controls make an already difficult task even harder. Master Higgins is extremely unresponsive and difficult to manoeuvre. And this game is just full of parts where precision is essential. It's incredibly easy to fall into a pit or run into an enemy, even if you see them coming.  If this wasn't bad enough, you only get a 1-up when you collect 50,000 points - which usually takes about 8 levels to obtain. And unless you find the hidden Hudson Bee at the end of the very first level, there are no continues. Yes. Many necessary power-ups are in hidden and usually quite not obvious locations. Even with visible power-ups, it's impossible to tell what's in which egg. If you're very unlucky, you'll release those horrid eggplants, which will stay on your tail and zap away your energy until you only have a couple of energy bars left. This goes beyond challenge and just becomes horribly unfair; not only can you not make even the most understandable mistake without being severely punished for it, but you practically can't find the few things which will help you!  Ironically the bosses are the easiest parts of the game, even if they increase in difficulty. At the end of each world (you will learn to tell when it's coming up), you will enter a palace and battle the Witch Doctor. The same strategy can be employed to defeat him each time, the only difference being that he changes heads (his only weak spot) and that he shoots his fireballs more rapidly. Still, those short bouts with him are as close as the game gets to atmosphere.  Isn't it strange that Adventure Island was released two years after Super Mario Bros., and that it tries to imitate it? It's strange because this game absolutely lacks everything which still makes SMB so much fun to play; good graphics, imaginative setting and characters, good controls and gameplay. There's no big climax waiting at the end, either; the King Quiller mentioned in the manual (sort of a master Witch Doctor, I presume) was never manifested into the real game, and I can tell you that he was the only reason why I completed the game. There's no sense of reward for enduring all the hell the game puts you through; you get a congratulatory screen and little else.  It just isn't fun to sit through this game; in fact, it's hard to imagine it was intended to be a fun experience at all for anybody who's not an absolute gaming wiz. It would be talent wasted anyway. The thing is, while Adventure Island can be a cute time waster from time to time, it's almost unplayable as a proper game. There is nothing rewarding about its so-called challenge; 100% attention is required at all times, and yet your few power-ups can be taken from you faster than you imagine. Adventure Island is undoubtedly a rather unremarkable and wickedly-hard game. If you actually beat it once, you probably won't want to go through it again. I know I don't.  The very best thing I can say has nothing to do with the game itself - new versions of this game on the PS2 and Wii make excellent work of the Witch Doctor.	-1
Unfortunately this game came to me used and had the Super Mario label on it but it was actually some weird bubble helicopter game that looked like it had graphics from Atari....	-1
This game is so so but the thing that kills it completely is the horrible, stupid controls.  Mario seems to have greese on his boots as he always slides of edges and makes crappy jumps to his death no matter what you do.  The graphics were pretty good for the time and the game is some what fun for about a half hour before it gets too repeditive to the point where you never want to see it again.  Mario 3 is the best one. This game only sold so many copies because it was shipped out with every NES  system.  Nintendo Entertainment System saved the gaming market not this crappy game.	-1
...Bad Dudes is a lack luster game. Once you beat it, it goes out of rotation and eventually gets traded in. I would not suggest this to anyone. I would prefer Double Dragon, River City Ransom or even the TMNT Arcade Game before this one. Don't waste your time or money.	-1
I don't quite get the appeal of Maniac Mansion.  It's strictly about solving puzzles while roaming the rooms and hallways of a really small mansion.  It's not action-based or interesting in any way other than the ironic and comedic portions that involve aliens and their many hilarious one liners.  There's strategy in making your way through the house but it's kind of tacky due to the game being so short and feeling incomplete.  There's no action whatsoever so the replay value is nonexistent which is another major issue with the game.  Maniac Mansion feels like it's caught between Home Alone and A Boy and His Blob except it lacks the suspense of Home Alone and the clever puzzle solving and adventure of A Bob and His Blob.  I'm not sure whether Maniac Mansion is based off a movie or not because the music is memorable enough to reach a level higher than video games.  It's fully developed and well-written enough to be comparable to a TV show theme.  That's what makes me suspicious that the game may be a video game version of a movie or show (or perhaps cartoon).  Each selectable character has their own theme song, and with the orange-haired guy the music is exceptionally memorable because it's some kind of groovy upbeat, danceable tune multi-part song that sounds like mid 80's Frank Zappa.  The orange-haired lady has a theme that reminds me of the late 70's/early 80's rock band the Cars.  Really awesome and catchy music at least.  Though the story doesn't make a bit of sense and the game is based entirely on solving clues Scooby Doo style, at least the occasional dialogue provides a few short laughs.  Otherwise a really forgettable and highly overrated video game that you'll never play again unless it's 20 years later and you're looking to take a trip down memory lane.	-1
Mega Man V is definitely the weakest of all 8 original Mega Man games.  It's so easy that you can beat it with the Mega Buster all the way through.  You don't need any of the weapons because each of the bosses dies very quickly as good ole blue Mega Man.  I beat the game within a couple of days [...].	-1

This is a dull, near impossible flight simulating game. Its not all that based on the movie, there is no real story, you are just a F-14 fighter in hostile territory. You have guns and select the rockets and missiles to use before each mission (level).  It is a nice flight simulator, but its just dull with long periods of sky, no clouds, no sea, no land, no obsticles. Then there is the challenge. Enemies firing rockets at you from sea and air. One rocket and you're dead, I suppose its like that in real life. Enemy jets get behind you and you need to shake them before they destroy you with their rockets or missiles.  Then halfway through a mission, you will need more jet fuel, so the flying fuel tanker flies in and you need to get the fuel just right or die trying. At the end of each mission, you need to land on an aircraft carrier with perfection. Too fast, you crash, too slow, you crash, too high, you crash, too low, you crash.  Its a prescise game, so if you love prescision, this is your game! However, for casual gamers, this is a frustratingly difficult and unfun game.	-1
NES Top Gun Hated this game growing up!  I never could land the freaking plane! Impossible.  I got this game back in the mid 1980s when it came out.  I hated it.  Namely because I never could land the damn plane on the freaking aircraft carrier.  For a mid 1980s game, it's a fairly decent, if boring, flight simulator.  But don't think you'll be getting a real flight simulator.  You just chose your plane, then you you fly in this big boring blue frame for a while, and try to dodge missles.  There's no real music.  That's the whole game.  There are four missions, but I only got to the third mission.  There's a good reason for that.  But what makes this game so notorious for those who remember it (my generation, basically), is landing the plane on the aircraft carrier.  When you land the plane, you get a long approach, in which the game will continually tell you to press up or down on the control pad, to made sure you are aligned properly.  And no matter how meticulously you follow the instructions, YOU ALMOST ALWAYS CRASH.  I can remember being a little kid and getting so frustrated at this game because I could never land.  My brother landed once or twice, but that's about it.  The other bad part is, I think in mission 3, you have to fuel midair when a big fuel plane comes up on top of you.  Just like landing, you have to press up or down to make sure the cable that will transport the gas from the fuel plane to your aircraft is properly aligned.  Just like the landing on the aircraft, you can never make the connection.  If the connection is not made, then the fuel aircraft will break the connection, leaving you to certain death as you will run out of fuel  before you reach the aircraft carrier, which you won't be able to land on anyway.  The reason why I could never get past mission three is, if I remember correctly, you have three lives.  You lose the first two lives on the first two missions because you can't land, then you lose your life because you can't fuel.  I think the fourth mission has to do with a space shuttle, but I never knew any of my friends who had the game to get to that level.  Just a really bad game.  Google Angry Video Game Nerd's review of it, he is, as usual, spot on (beware, he has a lot of adult language to the point his reviews are borderline obscene, but still funny as hell).  Oh, also, this game has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE.  The movie even came out well before the game.  NO CONNECTION at all.	-1
My recollection of this game is that it survived a *very* short time in rotation as the lead Mario property. SMB had taken America by storm and changed the way NES was packaged and sold. People - *old* people of 30 years or more would get the thing out at parties and challenges would start, to the point that some wives would hide the cords when hosting guests.  SMB2, however, was a damp squib. The game play was so radically different to SMB's run-jump-and-squish that people were not happy with it. Hell, I sat with one guy and we couldn't figure out what we were supposed to do from the start screen. After a few minutes we just played something else.  I recently scored a copy of this for the Wii (with the other Mario Bros games) and started to explore it. The vertical drop start was stupidly annoying but I did eventually get it started this time around - after an inordinate amount of time wastage.  In fact, it is no accident copies of SMB2 for the NES are rare. NES hurried SMB3 into production that featured a more natural SMB mechanic and added a sort of modest exploration mechanic too (and stuck in some ace puns like the flute from Legend of Zelda which has a *very* different effect in SMB3). SMB2 faded into well-deserved obscurity.  It wasn't just that the game wasn't as much fun as SMB and SMB3, it fought you when it came to figuring out what you were supposed to *do* and that is just poor design.  Yes, I get that the game has its fans who think it is the best thing since sliced bread. Good for them. I wouldn't have it any other way. There was a short-lived buzz of interest in the early Nintendo Fun Club magazine (which became Nintendo Power later in life) to prove they are not alone. But to claim this game has all the appeal of its predecessor or successor is stretching the point as far as the buying majority is concerned. Even Spy Hunter is more fun than this game in my opinion.  I also know the eventually unveiled "real history" of this game, which was irrelevant to me by the time it was made public. I always knew it as SMB2. Excuses about it not being a "real SMB game" are lame and beside the point.  This is the only SMB game I am never tempted to re-visit.	-1
It is a side scrolling game where you play as all 4 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and pause the game to select a different turtle. Donatello has the longest ranged, slowest and most powerful. Rapheal has the quickest, shortest and least damaging. Michaelangelo and Leonardo are somewhere in between. This game is more difficult than fun. Difficult as opposed to challenging. Most everything can kill you quickly. There are top down areas (which seem almost pointless) where you wander from sewer to sewer where the real side scrolling action is. Foot soldiers and various other enemies that don't quite make sense for a turtles game.  This is a game that requires some prescision and the turtles control pretty poorly. There is quite a bounce back when you get hit. Jumps are tough to control. Not a good game at all. It is just a missed oppertunity for what could have been a great debut for the turtles on the NES.  The next two turtle games for the NES were much better.	-1
As a kid, I actually somewhat enjoyed this game.  It came to Nintendo's virtual console, so I decided why not download it for a change?  After all, in the late 80's early 90's I really enjoyed this game.  It was really something to have.  Years later it's apparent of two things: The game was horribly designed, and it CAN'T stand the test of time.  The fact that on Nintendo's VC it's also a dollar more than the other NES games is also questioning.  It's hard to make a game this bad.  If you were a fan of the Turtles a long time ago back in the early 90's the first thing you'll notice about the game is that it hardly has anything to do with the show at all outside of some of the major characters.  Outside of that there are no foot soldiers, and most of the enemies you encounter you never saw in the show in the first place.  You will come across Bebop and Rocksteady but none of the other enemies were actually ever in the show in the first place.  Kind of daunting.  What really makes the game horrible, however, lies within the gameplay.  Firstly, the turtles themselves are unbalanced and put to unfair use.  You can switch between any of the turtles at a time, but for the most part, only one of them is of any use to getting you through the adventure.  Michaelangelo and Raphael are completely useless, as their weapons lack to the range to actually do anything.  Leonardo is alright, but Donatello is the only real useful one here, as he's the only one who can attack downward and at a range.  More than likely you'll only want to use the other three to sacrifice so that Donatello can do some beating up on enemies.  The way the levels are designed is also horrendous.  You basically walk around an overworld map and go into sewers, warehouses and whatnot.  The problem is that you never know where to go next.  This non-linear style wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many blasted dead ends.  To make the experience even more grueling, the game is just FULL of enemies that will respawn almost the second you turn around.  You could go through a tough warehouse fighting tons of tough enemies, only to find you can't go any further.  So now you'll have to backtrack and you may have to fight all those enemies again.  So if you don't lose a turtle getting to a dead end, you'll probably lose him getting from it.  The game isn't really difficult, it's just unfair and frustrating.  The fact that two of your four players are completely useless tells you something.  The later turtles games were far better than this.  Skip the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.  It's so unfair that the experience is frustrating.  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II and III were far better, and there's still no turtles game that beats the all time best: Turtles IV: Turtles in Time.  If you need a classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fix, the first Turtles game on the NES isn't going to do it.	-1
Mickey Mousecapade Three stars - somewhat playable by today's standards, but there's better fare out there  "Mickey Mousecapade", the first of a series of highly successful Capcom games using Disney trademarks, was published by Capcom in Nintendo but actually developed Hudson Soft in Japan. It the only Capcom published Disney game not actually developed by Capcom. Several sprites from the game are directly lifted from other Hudson Soft games.  "Mickey Mousecapade" is certainly one of the more obscure titles in the Capcom library. The game has some rather ugly graphics (even for an NES title), but the game certainly has its own style of charm.  There are numerous regional differences between the Japanese and North American versions. The stage bosses are all different between the two versions, and so is much of the enemy roster. The Japanese version is more heavily based on "Alice in Wonderland".  The plot of the game is to rescue a friend of Mickey and Minni, who turns out to be Alice of "Alice in Wonderland". The final boss is Maleficent from "Sleeping Beauty" in the US versiona nd the Queen of Hears from "Alice in Wonderland" in the Japanese version. Pete, who is often the final boss in Disney games, is the fourth boss in the American version.  Strangely enough, there is a Hidden Mickey embedded in the circuit board, clearly visible when the game cartridge is disassembled.  Like the NES "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer", the graphics are ugly and primitive.  Although published in Japan in 1987, "Mickey Mousecapade" was published in 1988 in North America, the same year "Ninja Gaiden", "Blaster Master" and "The Guardian Legend" were published.  The grapchis are so bad the game looks like an NES launch title rather than one published later.  Ultimately, Capcom's other Disney games far outshine this title.  Unless you are nostalgic for this title, the NES offers much better fare than this.  Although to be fair, the NES also offers much WORST fare than this game as well.  While Mickey Mousecapade does offer some enjoyment, I would recommend "Duck Tales", "Duck Tales 2", "Chip and Dale", "Chip and Dale 2", "Little Mermaid", "Aladdin", or "The Jungle Book" over this travesty.  The video game website IGN rated this title as the 877h greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time.  (For those looking for great unknown NES/Famicom games, you simply MUST play "Moon Crystal", a criminally unknown Famicom exclusive.  The graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo "Ninja Gaiden", amazing music, in depth gameplay, and a fantastic storyline.  Absolutely amazing! Had this been released in the US for the NES, I feel it would be as revered as the other heavy hitters in the NES canon)  If you [likes hooters]  Two stars - barely playable by today's standards	-1
Capcom usually creates awesome games after Disney titles, but when they came out with this, it was questioned whether or not Capcom were capable of licensing Disney titles since Mickey Mousecapade was its first.  Its a s**tty game!  It starts off as a ok game (you find magic stars in a Fun House and shoot random animals and moving deadly furniture), but the formula goes on and on and on...  The levels do get harder (too hard for a kids' game), but the repetitiveness and cheap deaths doesn't fair too well.  The cheapest death is when Minnie falls off the ledge, your character (Mickey) falls with her.  She is a liability throughout the whole game so controlling her while playing as Mickey can be a b***h!  The second cheapest death is getting hit and stopping in midair (especially when you're over a cliff or water in mid-jump).  This doesn't give you much time to steer your jumps, but its better than the "backwards hit" bulls**t found in other games.  The game frustrated me as a kid and I never got past the final level because the damn eagle is always kidnapping Minnie and rescuing her is always a hassle.  Also, on the pirate ship level (Level 4), you might as well turn the game off if you didn't happen to get the second magic stars for Minnie in level 1.  Pegleg Pete will throw a zillion of knives at your direction so it will be impossible to deck him without loosing a life.  The only trick is making sure Minnie has her stars because she'll be immune to Pete's attacks (making sure she jumps on the ledge of where Pete is attacking is kind of a hassle).  Without a word of mouth from a friend who happened to make this trick work through trial and error or with a Nintendo Power magazine, you're stuck.  Though the internet will may now give you a clear walkthrough on this frustrating abomination, its not worth a dollar (go buy a McDouble cheese burger with it instead of this s**tty game).  Other Disney titles that Capcom will make in the future would be a huge improvement in gameplay and graphics such as Duck Tales, Rescue Rangers, and Darkwing Duck so try those out and stay away from "Mickey Mousecrapade," please!	-1

Ok, the original version of SMB 2 was only released on the Famicon which really sucks. This version of the game was a remake of Doki Doki, that is why the story seems really strange for a Mario game.  I will reccommend Mario All Stars, if you want to play the original version of this game. At all costs don't get this Doki Doki crap.	-1
Wow, Metal Gear II: Snake's Revenge is really awful.  I'm totally shocked since I like the first one on the NES.  Snake's Revenge just does so many things wrong I don't know where to begin in describing the many noticeable problems.  Let's start with the way Snake moves.  He moves slow and clunky this time around as do the enemies, whereas on the first Metal Gear the pace moves swiftly.  Nothing particularly great mind you, but a lot better than this.  Stealth and infiltrating is comically an afterthought now.  Yes that's right- you know how you're supposed to avoid being detected by guards?  Know how you're supposed to walk up behind them or sneak around without being noticed?  Well Snake's Revenge seems to abandoned this great concept unintentionally with horrible gameplay and slow, uninspiring animations of the tiny characters and foes we see on screen.  You can practically walk directly up to a guard and be mere inches in front of him without him freaking out and spotting you.  What in the world?  However the funniest thing about this game is that the animations are so pitiful when you punch or shoot someone to death, they show no reaction to the fact you just damaged them so they freeze in place, then a moment later they simply disappear.  LOL!  The first Metal Gear was a lot better than this.  Most of the gameplay involves walking throughout abandoned and very generically created storage facilities with a strong emphasis on finding items (such as the overuse of collecting and using key cards) in small rooms to advance the... not the plot since the game practically has none, but to advance to the next boring part of the storage facility while equally unimpressive music appears throughout your little quest.  I actually think the horrible animation of the guards along with your character and overall taking a few steps back compared to the first Metal Gear is the biggest issue I have with this game.  The lack of enemy variety is another problem, as is the repetition of looking for items, rescuing trapped people that give simple useless advice with laughably bad grammar, and of course the unbearably slow play control are MORE major issues.  This game is a disaster all around.  The challenge level goes up a lot just as soon as you find yourself in rooms with floor traps such as disappearing floor tiles that expand really wide and other types of traps that require carefully maneuvering around in order to succeed.  This is all rather difficult.  The game has a way of making the boss fights really difficult and swarming you from many different directions but countering this with simplistic guards roaming the hallways in the other portions of the game, so Snake's Revenge has major imbalance issues.  In fact most of your time is spent walking back through the tiny rooms where you came and loading up on ammo since ammo reappears in the same spot the moment you leave the room.  You can easily fill up on ammo this way.  Not that you really need much of it except for the inevitable boss fights.  The story is nonexistent and unexceptional, and I can't think of a single reason to ever play this train wreck of a game.  It's just awful no matter how you slice it.	-1
Truly, this is the worst Zelda game in the entire franchise.  I remember playing this when I was a kid back in the early 90s, and I was disgusted by it then.  Now 20 years later, I am STILL repulsed by it.  It's exceptionally frustrating.  I have nothing against it being a side-scroller, but trying to attack enemies is ridiculous and very difficult.  You die a LOT in this game, and I don't have any patience for that.  And when you lose all your lives, it's truly game over.  Horrible.  They really should call this game Zelda Souls, after the Dark Souls franchise.  Stay away from this one!	-1
The damned thing has never worked. Not one time. I carefully and properly cleaned it after being fed up with it, after trying any combination of tricks to get it to work -- tilting the cartridge, moving it from side to side, etc. -- and still, it refused to work. Nothing but a black screen on the Monitor and a golden cartridge that might as well be giving me the finger. Not satisfied.	-1

If only it were possible to rate a zero, this game would have earned it. Not only should this game NEVER have been made, every copy found to exist should be destroyed. It's an abomination to the license and one of the worst games ever created in the history of Nintendo. Yeah, I'm a fan of Zelda. No, I don't like easy games. I like games which challenge my skill & intellect, not my patience & sanity. I disliked Zelda II when it first came out but gave it a second chance when offered as a free download to my 3DS from Nintendo. After a very solid second shot, it's now deleted from my system. Where can I even begin?? There are no rewards for defeating opponents. The control is appalling. There's no strategy involved. It's too easy to get hurt, almost impossible to heal, and no matter where you are in the game, dying forces you to start over at the beginning. This isn't a game. This is a violation of the Geneva Convention. Unless you have a mental disorder which causes you to enjoy having to complete the same monotonous tasks OVER AND OVER, don't bother. In fact, the game could even cost you hundreds to play. For some, the torment & frustration could cause you to destroy a perfectly good console. It wouldn't have taken much to turn this into an enjoyable game. It's as though the designers were TRYING to kill the Zelda license. Thank God it survived to have a third title. But the second title should have been recalled & buried.	-1
Double Dribble is an awful basketball game despite what anybody says. I've hated it back then, and I hate it today. The controls are pretty choppy, and all the game amounts to: dunk, steal, dunk, and then some. The shooting is impossible to do; I just have a lot better chance making a dunk than shooting from anywhere else. My teammates are quite useless when it comes to playing defense. The only best part of the game is the dunking scene. But since I do it like every time, it gets really boring. What's with the halftime show? The game won't let me to skip that, forcing me to watch the dreadful display of cheerleading. All in all, playing Double Dribble is like trying to eat lots of mayonnaise and nothing else.	-1
This is a must have for those people who just want to one up their friends. You both play as spies in a single building. Each building is a level, and there are only eight levels. As the spy your mission is to find the exit to the building before the other spy. Ofcourse the other spy is looking for the exit too, so you must set traps, such as spring doors, buckets of acid over the doors, bombs, and other traps to stop him. When one of you die, you start at the beginning of the building again. Its a nice game, but there is no challenge in the one player mode, so it goes by very quickly.	-1
I had the misfortune of getting this game back at the end 1989 for my NES. At that time, I also owned an Atari 800XL with Ultima III: Exodus and Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar, which are really enchanting RPG, if you don't mind the crude graphics, so I was hoping Hydlide would be another Ultima, but boy was I wrong. Let's get with the music: it's some of the worst video game music I have ever heard! Cheap ripoff of the Indiana Jones theme song which keeps repeating itself over and over every 15 seconds. I never wanted to play this game unless the volume was turned off because the music will get on your nerves in no time flat. This "music" (which I refuse to think of as music) sounds like the worst garbage you'd hear from a music box. The graphics are very crude looking, and even for the 8-bit NES capability, it's really horrible (the graphics of Bionic Commando is miles better than this garbage). Heck, even the old Atari 8-bit adapation of the Ultima series looks better. How about playability? Well you have to run in to slimes and other monsters and press the A button to try to destroy them, but more chances than not, you'll end up killed. Often if you stand in the wrong vegetation, or you stand in the cemetary, your hit points drain without even monsters touching you (until you gain enough experience points). Basically in this game, you're supposed to collect all three fairies before you're able to kill the dragon. It took me ten years to finally win the game. That was in 1999, I finally won the game because I was finally able to find that third fairy. I didn't realize I was supposed to kill two wizards at once with the wave spell to get that last fairy. Perhaps the worst of this game is when you want to save it. You need to obtain an unnecessiarly long password and write it down. More chances than not you have written the password incorrectly and you pretty much lost what you accomplished in this horrible game. The Ultima series were wonderful, spellbinding RPGs (as long as you owned the Atari, Apple, or Commodore 64, rather than the NES or SNES adaptation). Hydlide is now regarded as not only the worst fantasy RPG ever made, but one of the worst ever made for NES. I have no idea what the makers of this game were thinking. Perhaps they were trying to cash in on the Legend of Zelda fad of the time and fell horribly flat. I have played much better NES games, including their adaptation of Willow, as well as Shadowgate, which means you are much better off checking out those games than Hydlide, unless you want to see just how bad games can get.	-1
Small controller, not very good for big hands. It is very hard to use. I would recamend a nes dog bone or nes reqtangle controller too this one	-1

Extremely bad graphics!	-1
Probably the only good thing to come out of Russia, Tetris was made famous during the heydays of Game Boy and became the highest selling game ever, mainly because it was included with the Game Boy. So, the NES version of Tetris became inevitable. So, here you have it: Tetris for NES. There is not much to say. It's rather a purposeless game with no end and no clear idea of what to aim for. I personally like Dr. Mario more. All in all, people like playing Tetris, but I don't. Check my youtube videos in how to beat this game by typing in "Mr. Math Expert" and the name of the game. so you can learn how to.	-1
This game for me is a weak attempt to copy the game 'Tetris'. It just  isn't as fun or challenging as i had hoped. The only plus that i see with this game is that it would be preferred over tetris by children because of the colorful graphics and cartoon look. So if you have children and are looking for a good clean kid friendly game to keep them entertained and expand their hand/eye coordination then this game might be a good choice.	-1
can buy a new one of these with no yellowing on it from allied records and comes with original controller and av cords	-1
Great gaming system!	-1

it only played super mario bros, and only when it felt like it.	-1
I grew up in the early 90's playing Mario, Punch Out, Zelda and the like on the NES. Honestly I was never truly that fond of it. I was never impressed or blown away by any games for it, I only played it to pass time as a kid. It wasn't until the release of the PS1/N64 that I became a hardcore gamer. Then the further graphical development of the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube only solidified my love for gaming. I never enjoyed the countless side-scrolling titles, I was always wanting something more in graphics and something less tedious. Not to mention the failure rate of the NES, not reading games, having to replace the 72-Pins over and over. It was an unreliable hunk of mediocrity.  I'm sure many consider it a classic and that's ok. I however don't share those same fond memories. I have chosen to let it die with the times and can't say I've missed it.	-1
Love the opening scene showing a knife charging down from the sky and landing in the eye of a skull!  This game is really bizarre.  I'm not a fan of the concept but it does blend RPG elements with side scrolling in a way that's not completely awful.  With better execution it probably could have been a great game.  You can choice between 6 characters called camp counselors (because the story is that these counselors have been selected to look after Crystal Lake for the summer not knowing Jason's out there).  3 boys and 3 girls, each containing their own abilities.  Some characters can run fast while others are slow with terrible jumping.  They can all do the basics at least which is run, jump, use weapons and row canoes.  Right away this seems like the game is trying to be more complex than necessary.  The object is to walk to different areas of the lake preventing Jason from harming children (15 in total) and you also have to keep the 6 playable (counselor) characters alive as well in your quest to keep the children safe. You have to kill Jason at least 3 times, but perhaps the game is random and more deaths are required.  Not sure.  Gather weapons to face Jason, strategize by finding health potions, keys to unlock hidden cabins in the woods or lake and distribute weapons among the counselors so everyone remains alive and well.  Nice strategy.  The difficulty is high due to the confusion of figuring out where to go and Jason popping up and causing problems (he gets faster and harder later on).  It's hard to figure out where to go because the game wasn't worked on long enough to differentiate one area from another, so many places look exactly the same.  Probably my biggest problem with the game (though to be fair you are given a map even if it's confusing, inaccurate and sends you heading the wrong way).  The map is useful in determining where Jason is however- a green dot on the map will indicate which cabin he's in so head over there as fast as you can or he'll kill a counselor.  I don't like the limited moves during the cabin fights with Jason- you can only move side to side or duck.  Well besides using a weapon too.  Your weapons include rocks, knives, machetes and torches.  You have to be close to enemies when throwing rocks to land your shot because the aim is in an arch direction which means a lot of times you'll miss.  Near the beginning you come across a lighter need to light fireplaces and a knife.  Whenever you hear a beep it means Jason found a counselor or kid, and you only have a limited amount of time to find the cabin containing Jason.  If you don't find the cabin in time he'll kill a counselor, but if you DO find the cabin in time a kid will say "Thank You".  Speaking of cabins you often have to enter them for a variety of reasons.  This is where the strategy comes into play.  Inside these cabins you can battle Jason for one thing, or help your counselors perform actions such as cure an injured character, switch between counselors, give a weapon to someone in need or pick up notes.  The way you search the lake/forest area is by finding paths north and south that you'll often see as you walk across the screen.  This is really clunky and awful level design in my opinion because, again, the paths all look very similar, and every path you take is dominated with the same few enemies (mostly zombies) that it turns into a bundle of confusion after a while.  To be fair the backgrounds offer nice variety using different colors to accurately show different times of the day.  This sort of helps differentiate one area from another.  The scenery approaching nightfall is the most interesting, but it's only temporary since the game uses a day/night cycle.  The caves and forests look okay but I've seen my share of those over the years.  Plus they can be confusing too.  While I normally never base a game on graphics, the way you take these many paths and end up on different screens is particularly clunky and low budget looking.  An NES game though, I get it.  Jason isn't the only boss fight either- there's also a purple haired demonic head that appears sometimes.  I should mention that the boss fights aren't like the ones you'd find in most 2D games- these ones are positioned near the top of the screen as the camera changes into a first person view which is probably supposed to capture the tension-filled feeling of the bosses being in front of you (I don't feel the tension though).  I don't mind the different view but the boss fights themselves are *really* mediocre.  With only Jason and a demonic head, the game feels incomplete.  Also, LOL!  For a while I had no idea the purple monster coming after me was Jason.  I thought it was just some purple monster.  Running from Jason (or Jason running from you, heh) are a numerous and redundant occurrence throughout this game.  Wherever you go you're treated to more zombies (geez haven't seen enough of those!)  Other enemies include wolves and diving black birds (all poorly animated).  That's about it.  Really bland small selection.  Also you come across Jason WAY too many times for such a short game.  This is clearly because the game doesn't offer enough variety in levels and enemies, so they throw several Jason appearances your way to make up for it.  Not that it matters much, but the game doesn't follow the movies at all.  I understand for the sake of a video game stories are often changed, but I think more suspense could have been implemented such as say, changing the concept so you're constantly running or hiding from Jason.  However maybe that would have backfired in a big way if Home Alone is any indication (one of the worst games ever).  Then again Home Alone would have been a lot better if there had been more ways to take out the robbers, and the home itself was bigger.  The same problem here too- Friday the 13th just needed to be a bigger game.  I think my biggest gripe is that Friday the 13th just isn't long enough.  It's just not enough on all counts- not enough enemy variety, not enough stage variety (really feels like I'm going through the same 3 or 4 areas the whole time), a sophisticated concept revolving around fighting Jason that was okay but could have been made better with more places to explore and more dangerous predicaments, Jason not being intimidating whatsoever (unless you count how fast he gets near the end which of course increases the cheapshots because your character can't move nearly as fast as he can), etc.  It honestly doesn't make sense that Jason wouldn't feel like a threat considering he pops up unpredictably a lot of times, but he's just so laughable sporting purple that it's hard to take him seriously.  Well until he gets faster with better weapons near the end- THEN I take him more seriously!  Others might see the underrated appeal in the game and the sophistication behind the concept, but it could have been done a whole lot better had the game simply been bigger.  A lack of a map in the woods and caves is just bizarre and only contributes to the confusion.  The lack of a scary atmosphere is favor of more straight forward music is another strange feature of the game.  It really feels like the concept behind Friday the 13th was worked on very well until a certain point, then the game was released incomplete.  The game feels 60% done.  Perhaps the release was following a strict deadline who knows.	-1
I rate it here because it works only five minutes and won't stop freezing up. I disliked this product. I would not recommend to anyone.	-1
Pile of crap.	-1
You play as a sportscar on your way in eight races against cars that all look the same. The play control is really bad as you can only go forward, nor can you even turn around, just move left and right. This was the first racing game for Nintendo, so what do you expect? There is still big challenge as you cross checkpoints to get more time, which makes the game so challenging, because there is so little time and the races are so tediously long. Another big thrill about the game was it is the first and only game that features 3D! The game came with 3D glasses and a 3D mode. Even though it never looked at all 3D, which is why this never caught on and no more 3D games were made.	-1
Only good to a certain point. Game would freeze	-1
No energy tanks, fancy gadgets, spike invulnerability when hit, and two less robot masters than most games in the series make this debut the bad kind of hard. The stages and bosses are EXTREMELY hard without the right equipment. The next one, Mega Man 2, is where greatness would first be reached.	-1
It's been said that everyone has to start somewhere, but man, what a stinker of a starting point!  The prerequisites of all that is Mega Man are present; the multi-tiered platform stages, those wacky bosses, the "rock-paper-scissors" weapon mentality, and it all would've been great if it wasn't made with 1986 NES technology.  Many of the major sins present include slow and choppy scrolling, uninspired level art, repetitive level design, and Mega Man climbing a ladder way too slow and dropping like a rock when falling from a great height.  It could've been more, much MUCH more, and looking back after being spoiled on the later games it's hard to consider this the genius it was meant to be.	-1
The unit came to me in completely different shape than was described. It looked yellow, there was a crack on the top, and it didn't include any of the extras that was in the picture. I sent it back and got a refund.	-1
i was expecting this item to work since i love the classic games.  when i recieved it i was highly annoyed.  it didn't come with any cords or anything. which i already expected and i had to order them from amazon to get it to work. unfortunatly the only play i got out this was the red light blinking on and off. no game screen nothing. just a waste of money.  its better to buy these systems brand new or check reviews on these items...	-1
So my order arrived very quickly which was a pleasant experience. However the system I ordered showed it come with the gun and controllers. When I opened the package no controllers, no gun, not even a power supply chord. Was very disappointed that they didn't state this on the order form. Now I have to hunt down the "accessories" Power chord and 1 controller aren't an accessory they are a requirement. I cant even test the unit to see if it works until that stuff arrives. I won't be doing business with the company who set this out again. Amazon is still my favorite source for online shopping but they should ban these people from selling on their site if they aren't going to ship what they show	-1
it wasn't even zelda for the NES. it was ocarina of time.	-1
Ugh, why do people like this game. Trying to kill enemies with the awkward 4-way sucks, there's no direction to where i'm going and exploration is a boring chore. One of the worst games on the NES.	-1
meh	-1
The game is good but apparently the seller I bought this from is not. It took 3 times for the game to even come up and it randomly crashes! The seller said it was in good condition and it was not. It was rattling, and the outside of it was a bit rough looking. Be careful who you buy this from!	-1
The Legend of Zelda Bad condition. Was supose to be in colletors grade condition was broken cart looked like it was threw a war had replaced screws on it .	-1
The nintendo Revolution will be backward campatable through the nes games of the '80s so why would you waste your money on this? In with the new out with the old.	-1
This is in my opinion one of the best Zelda games in the series and the one that started franchise over 25 years ago.  Excellent gameplay, solid puzzles and a great story. Not to mention the classic tinny 8-bit soundtrack the plays over and over again in your head.  However unless this is a stolen top secret prototype originally wrapped in vacuum sealed plastic and your a classic video game collector with your money burning a hole in you wallet/pocket/bank account.  This classic genuine experience can be had for a few dollars through Nintendo's own emulation on any Wii system (or other means of emulation on your PC if you can get the ROM).  I really recommend for any gamer young and old to experience this classic gem; I also recommend you be smart with your money.  This seller needs to be packaging up and selling whatever it is they were smoking, $1600.00 for this is just insane and beyond ridiculous.	-1
Although the first in a popular series, this isn't the best and is incomparable to Super Metroid. Granted the game is big, which means there is lots of exploring, there is one set of closely related problems that make Metroid less than steller, all related to attacking: Samus curls (or does nothing if you don't have the ball) when you press down so she cannot duck and shoot, disabling her from attacking small anemies on the ground until she has the ball-bomb or wave beam much later in the game. Additionally, Samus cannot shoot diagnally in any direction and she cannot shoot downwards. In my review of Super Mario 64, I said that one shouldn't only complain about what a game does NOT have; however, these features would be practically essential to the game. Buy only if you are a hardcore Metroid fan or you really want to play the game that started it all. Otherwise, look somewhere else.	-1
I got this game hoping it would be just as good as any sonic game on the market, maybe even better! This game is WAY to easy. Don't get me wrong, the graphics are incredibale! There is just no point to this game. My friend also has this, or I should say HAD it. He smashed it and threw it in the trash he hated it so much. Don't buy this. Get sonic and knucles instead.	-1
Game kept freezing	-1
Sorry but this game is too much bad aged	-1
Game didn't work	-1
The game is not booting all times i power on, i have to try few times to do it successfully. Connections are very used and might be this the problem. Its only acceptable. Anyway, great game.	-1
This Game doesn't play.  I bought it and I thought it was my Nintendo but it's the game.  Wish I had returned it.  Now, I wish I could play it but I cannot.  I probably was a sucker from this user that sold it to me.  UNHAPPY	-1
This game is way too hard to be fun. Of all the final fantasy games this one is the worst.  The PS1 version is a lot better and not has hard as finding this one. Which is long out of print.	-1
Didn't order this	-1
I'm done with this. I couldn't beat this when I was ten and can't beat it at 35. Games are supposed to be fun, this is simply a repetitive reflex test with no story. Plenty of other awesome NES games to sink hours into. I'll pass on this classic.	-1
All the Megaman games are way to dawn hard, esspessially MM 6 thats insane.  I have played all these and the only one I enjoyed and played alot was Megaman 5 on origional gameboy the rest just pissed me off.	-1
Super Off Road is a very cool and fast-paced racer for the Super NES and Sega Genesis! But for the original NES? Well....it probably would've been better if the same development team was behind it. Rare was behind this version of Super Off Road, and unfortunately, it suffers quite a bit.  It's not exactly a BAD game, but it's very weak in comparison to its 16-Bit counterparts. All of the cars move too slowly for any enjoyment out of speed, and the races tend to drag. The music is also a big step down. Gone are the gritty, catchy, and radically memorable tunes, and in are exclusive, just okay-ish songs.  All of the game's mechanics are still there, though - Using nitros to move a little faster and purchasing upgrades are all present and accounted for, and they work just as fine. Just a shame the sense of speed and the audio department are really lacking. It hurts the game as a whole.	-1
Not impressed	-1
I was under the impression this was a game for supernintendo not nintendo. So in that case I was very unhappy when I opened the package and saw the wrong game =(	-1
the game sucks and its not realistic. this game would be fun if it had blood and if mario died instead of being defeated then it would be more realistic and fun, but i cant blame the people from the 1980s thinking blood was too violent. thats bull and this game sucks.  By the way, PROBLEM /v/?	-1
"Dear God, please let this horrible game be a figment of my imagination"  Nope, it's real.  What an unbelievable piece of overrated garbage Super Mario Bros. 3 is.  For the life of me I don't get the appeal of this game.  Through each of the eight boring worlds it's just the same thing every time: run to the end of each and every extremely short, uncreative level collecting worthless crap so you can move on to the next short, uncreative level.  Super Mario Bros. 3 is complete baboon poop.  It really is.  Nothing good about this game at all.  No reason for Mario or video game fans to remember this crappy adventure.  No reason for this game to exist.  Thank God there are sensible people out there such as myself to give you the honest truth.  Let's get right to the point and talk about all the stinky things:  One, and this is the biggest reason Super Mario Bros. 3 isn't any good.  You can only play as Mario and Luigi.  In Super Mario Bros. 2 you can play as the Princess and Toad in addition to Mario and Luigi.  Not so here.  In this game, Mario and Luigi don't even have anything unique to separate the two, so they are basically the same exact person (except Mario is red and Luigi is green).  Remember how high Luigi can jump in Super Mario Bros. 2?  Well now he jumps just like Mario.  Absolutely no reason for this.  If anything, Luigi should have MANY more interesting things about him this time around since, after all, Super Mario Bros. 3 comes AFTER Super Mario Bros. 2 and you'd think the most logical thing would be to continue adding MORE things with each new series.  But in this case, you get less.  I guess Nintendo FORGOT to make Luigi stand apart from Mario.  Another problem: this game is so freakin' predictable.  Gee, after the desert world I go to... a water world?  You don't say!  What?  There's an ICE world and a plant world coming up?  No way!  And what's THIS I see?  The final world will be BIG DARK EVIL FIRE WORLD?  I didn't see THAT coming.  Thanks Nintendo, for making Mario fans look like complete idiots.  Way to go.  Other serious problems become noticeable after a couple hours of playtime such as the fact that you have to do so much boring jumping in this game.  You have to jump on top of (or over) SO many things that it becomes an absolute chore after world 3 (if you even MAKE it that far without shutting off the game, that is).  If you find anything exciting about jumping over pipes or jumping on top of goombas or picking up and kicking buzzy beetles, then I recommend seeking professional help.  Ok, what else makes Super Mario Bros. 3 suck so much?  It can't get any worse, right?  Yes it can.  After you beat the game a message comes up on the screen that says "Thank you, but our princess is in another castle.  Just kidding, hahaha".  You mean to tell me, after all that long, hard and tedious work making it to the very end, Nintendo is going to joke around and make like the adventure isn't over yet?  Before the "just kidding" part, you might very well rip apart your controller or punch a hole in your TV screen all because Nintendo wants to play around and pretend there's still more to the adventure.  I can't even think of appropriate words to describe how angry this makes me.  Tears of anger are almost dripping down my face.  Nintendo NEVER should have done that.  I bet that most people who first seen that message really thought the princess was in another castle and came THIS close to killing the nearest living thing next to them.  Bad Nintendo.  And guess what?  You have to face one of Bowser's kids at the end of every world.  I'm not kidding.  I was honestly expecting to fight Bowser's WIFE before fighting him, but it never happened.  That's probably for the better.  Who knows how horrific she looks.  I'm still trying to figure out what everyone sees in this game.  It's old and forgettable.  Honestly, I think nowadays the only people who enjoy Super Mario Bros. 3 are older folks whose children have moved away to college or to start a family, and they left behind their NES and Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge so their parents had something to do.  All these older folks miraculously happen to enjoy the game so now EVERYONE acts like it's the best game of all-time.  Well it's not.	-1
Although I'm not too impressed of the cover art of this title, but what I found to be much unimpressive is the horrific gameplay.  For those that don't know, the famous Italian actor name Fabio Lanzoni is the model posing with the sword on the game's cover like a bad-ass and its a common marketing tool to get kids' parents (including a horny middle aged housewife or single mother - lol) to waste their hard earned money on a mediocre game for their kids.  For starters, the character's (Kuros) sword attack is very short range and awkward (you don't stand a chance against any melees when neccessary).  There are other alternative attacks like projectile spells, but they deplete your magic very quickly and they must be conserved for the elemental boss battles of which swifter than lightning strategies are mandatory.  Weapon upgrades don't help as much and you can't perform a jump attack which is neccessary for those multiple airborne creatures that must be warded off.  The jump configurations are useless and I thought it was me, but its hard to steer while in the air. The game's music is pleasing and so are the graphics and color schemes.  The game's objectives are simple and to the point - defeating all four elemental guardians who stand in your way to obtain the iron sword you must use to defeat the evil Malkil in the Icefire Mountain.  To progress through each level, Kuros must find a golden artifact for each Animal King for each elemental domain and they will help you advance toward the domain so he can find the neccessary magic spells and armor/weapon upgrades (range of the weapon still sucks) needed to defeat each Guardians.  As I said before the controls are very flawed and adding on the the difficulty is the absent "after hit" invisiblity, fast depleting life bar, difficulty in seeing whats ahead before its too late due to the screen's influent pace, and limited continues.  Iron Sword looks like it could've been a very good game, but due to the mild success of the previous game and the cover art of the game, it misleaded many gamers and kids wasted their money and time on this mediocre title.  The game designers are laughing their heads off and collecting their money while many frustrated gamers like myself are biting the controls as early as level 1 because we die from multiple enemy attacks due to the cumbersome controls.  The game designers didn't want to repeat the same formula as simular themed great games like The Legend of Zelda, Gauntlet, and Castlevania, but I think they took three steps back by trying to emulate an average game like Capcom's Ghosts & Goblins, but they failed.  I wasted a good $5 on this title and I can't take it back.	-1
ninjas always rock. it's a scientific fact. this game is not science. i bought this game knowing full well how bad it was. it was a novelty purchase. some games are so terrible they become quite entertaining. from the campy dialogue, to the unclear objectives, and to the run, jump, shoot ninja stars mechanic, this game is bad. where is the kitana sword? not here. the story line is......who cares. ninjas should do awesome flips and throught punching, and slice through enemies with a sword. should one purchase this game? no. unless you are like me and like to watch trainwrecks.	-1
What a shock. That's all I can say. Secret of Mana (SoM) and it's ilk that used the same game engine (most notably Secret of Evermore) defined, in my  heart, what a live action RPG should be. There where several key things  that defined the SoM game.   One was the co-op play with another player  (up to three players total). This allowed the game to be put into the  "play at parties" pile. Games are fun by yourself, even more fun  when two skilled players are in on it. Sadly this is poorly implemented in  Legend of Mana (LoM). It's bad enough when the other player has a hard time  interacting with the game world. Worse when you have to go to a  "special" place for that second person to join. Even lower still  when the NPC's are unstable. By that I mean in SoM the two NPC characters  only left the main character alone for any great amount of time once, after  joining the party. LoM NPC's don't stick around for very long. At least the  other player can "import" their characters.   The other was  the incredible item wheel. This gaming innovation allowed the player to  quickly select any item or spell in the heat of battle. This wonderful  innovation in gaming is sadly missing and once again players are forced to  suffer through menus.   And finally, the battles stink. SoM allowed  complete and total freedom when dealing with the baddies (Except for the  level bosses). You chose to stay and fight or you chose to run for cover.  LoM battles are loaded on an area by area basis and running is not an  option. This isn't a problem at first but your patience will wear out very  quickly after you fought the same dang monsters for the 26th time.   I  own the Japanese sequel to SoM. Suffice to say it is not fair to make this  kind of punishing leap to the American market when the American market  expects a sequel to SoM and not Seiken Densetsu 3. ALL of the key elements  that made SoM a sleeper hit in the US is missing in this one. LoM is  nothing more than an empty collectors item. Although this game does have a  few redeeming qualities. I gave one star to the eye-popping eye-candy,  which make this a great game to watch. And the colorful world is a joy to  explore, but strip it all away and what do you have? An empty game that is  trying to cash in on the underground success of SoM.   I give another  star to the insight of ingenious programmer who configured the controls for  one-handed use. You'll need it when your brain reduces it's operating level  to a minimum while playing.	-1
I loved Secret of Mana, the earlier Mana game on the Super Nintendo, and loved it -- among many other Square games. I was really happy to get my hands on this new Mana game... but I am incredibly disappointed in it! The game has no storyline. After a neat intro, you control a very generic guy or girl character (named "YOU") that rarely speaks. You choose a spot on a blank map for your home, then place other areas of the game on joining spaces, eventually building up a big world. Other characters in the game come and go as little "mini-quests" pop up (bookended by a cute title and little "The End" scene whenever you complete the quest). Completing the quests basically consists of walking around an area on your map and killing enemies and a boss enemy. This brings up the battle system, which is a step back from Secret of Mana. Instead of the fast-paced gameplay of SoM, you are drawn into little battles when you near enemies. Battling mainly consists of pushing buttons quickly while near enemies. The graphics don't allow for much detail, so any sense of strategy is hopeless. You have little real control over the other characters in your team (unless you go through the trouble of setting up two-player play, which is often more hassle than it's worth). The graphics are nice, though incredibly happy. Still, it is as if players are controlling a small part of a nice piece of animation... the animation, however, has no plot or sense of coherency. The graphics do not make up for the incredibly bad gameplay and lack of story. Even if you were a fan of Secret of Mana or love Square's other games, do not rush out and buy Legend of Mana. Instead rent the game and, if you like what you see, then consider buying it. I am disappointed I bought the game without previewing it first. I don't think I would have wanted to see the game through after seeing its poor quality.	-1
The first Mana game, Final Fantasy Adventure, was awesome. So was its remake called Sword of Mana. And Secret of Mana, for the SNES, was an amazing classic beloved by many after all these years. So what happened with Legend of Mana?  First off, this game doesnt have the free flowing world and fighting of the previous games. There is no linking areas to travel between. Each area/dungeon has its own little space and must be found by doing quests. After you have obtained the new area you can place it anywhere on the world map, for reasons not wholly known or cared for. Its a very strange concept at best.  And the battles. Oh, what a terrible system!  When you enter a battle, all of which are preset and cannot be avoided, your character moves in stutter steps. He/she moves somewhat like a fencer, a pace at a time. This makes for awkward movement. And if you want to dodge enemies you have to move up and down. Want to attack? You can only attack the left and right. This two-way dodge/attack system was totally uneccessary compared to Sword and Secret of Manas free moving combat.  And the difficulty of the game... or lack there of.  In battle you can hide in a corner and slowly replenish life. Have a teamate? Stand close to them and you will regain life about 3x faster then normal. And sometimes defeated enemies drop candy which replenish all or most of your life. Oh, and after every battle you regain ALL of your life.  There are more ways to heal your character in battle than to attack!  All in all this game is a garbled mess. Its a failed attempt of Square to make a 'unique' Mana game which strays from the original formula. I cannot believe this game came from the same company as Secret of Mana, the Chrono games, and the Final Fantasy games. Avoid at all costs.	-1
Despite all that, there is a right way to do them, as well as the wrong way, which they just did.  If you want a plot that works, make every action depending upon your specific reaction have roughly ten possible outcomes, but then merge them later weave 20 or 30 separate plots depending on what you have done, and that can suddenly shift if you do something really odd, and make the story alter entirely.  Instead Legend of Mana appeared from when I played it to be nothing more than a bunch of loosely strung together garbage- go to a town, solve the puzzle, hear a bunch of drivel that doesn't add up to anything else in your head, get the item and build a new town.  The only thing that was recurring was that the faerie princess kept losing her way from what I played, but what did that have to do with anything.  This is an example of a good nonlinear plot:  You are a child in a town that gets destroyed by an evil overlord. The survivors worship you as the hero and fully expect you to right wrongs and destroy the overlord (base plot).  Now as you set out, you're swinging your sword about like a fool and you kill a cat by accident. You get arrested for animal cruelty, and put in prison.  So then in prison you meet a rogue girl who sets you free, and she tell you that the overlord is small potatoes, that the real problem is this organization that is supposed to be the law but is imposing too harse penalties on minor offenses, so under her tutelage, you become a career criminal.  OR you continue on your way and the overlord send an assassin to poison your drink, but she has a change of heart and drug it instead.  You get sent as a slave to be a gladiator, but you fight well and impress the army and instead fight in a war.  OR you continue unswayed and finally reach the overlord's castle only it seems the townspeople were lying, the guy is really a paladin who saw extreme corruption in the town, and put an end to it, and he has proof. So you march right back tothe town and see that he was right.  This is nonlinear plotline, the plot can make any twist imaginable throughout the game, even sacricing the original antagonize or even the hero.  Assume the hero died in the thief story, the plot might now revolve around the rogue girl, and her adventures.	-1
This game has very good graphics but the excitement is not so high. This game is very theoretic and leaves you thinking. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this game just because it wasn't as fun as I thought it would be. But hey, that's just me! It's a good game if you're in to serious philosphies and wonders about life.	-1
I have liked every game Dreamcatcher has ever released, but this one was a little tough to swallow. In typical Dreamcatcher fashion, the graphics are wonderful and the music is very relaxing and laid back. I think the reason for the calming music was the fact that this game is very annoying. Now. I consider myself to be pretty good at solving puzzle games, and if I get stuck, I call a couple of friends and we work these out together. But neither of us liked this game very well. the clues aren't detailed enough and many of these puzzles are repititious. You don't know if you have done the puzzle right until the end of that sequence. Very annoying. when they speak to you, it's like your speaking to Confuscious. Very hard to discern the clues they are giving. My suggestion is spend your money on another Dreamcatcher game: Traitors Gate. That is a game worthy of all point and click puzzle solving game players.	-1
I would have given it two and a half stars, but I'll have to give it two.  There are some fun puzzles in this game, but it lacks a lot. One -- some of the puzzles are badly unoriginal.  The worst example of this is a player piano that imitates the game "Simon", where you have to remember the tune and play it back.  Other puzzles almost repeat themselves Two -- the puzzles do not interact with the game play at all.  The game is basically just a walkthrough movie, with puzzles here and there to solve so that you can make it to the next part of the movie.  In this respect, it is somewhat like the game "Fool's Errand" Three -- the animation moves too darn slow in the puzzles.  When you click on a move, the characters or icons on the screen move annoyingly slow. Overall though, if you buy it cheap off the rack, it will be worth it for you.  But it is still not a great game at all.	-1
Will Sim City 5 ever come out EA Games!? I'm bored of Destinations already and love my city building games but one can only create the same city over and over with different designs before it gets to old!	-1
Don't get me wrong Sim City 2000 was great I loved it.  But this game is just Sim City 2000 with better graphics.  Thats all I have to say.  Im mad I bought it when I already have Sim City 2000.  Oh yea you can not make farms, I tried, its imposible.	-1
Sim City 3K Unlimited is definately a great game, but it doesn't work correctly on many systems.  This is the only PC game I have ever encountered that my CD drives scratch just by using it (mind you I have no clue why. I excanged it twice already).  It only works correctly running windows 95 or 98, none of the 2000 editions (ME, 2000, XP).  If you are a fan of the Sim City Franchise, buy this game and make sure you have the reccommended requirements for best gameplay.  Otherwise, I wouldn't reccommend it.	-1
SimCity 3k has great graphics hands-down, but if you've played oyther SimCitys then you've played SimCity 3k. The gameplay is identical with minor tweaks here and there, but with most of the hype that went into this game left out. You can't tweak individual buildings, or really get into the management of a city as you would like to. Once again things like subways and buses operate without an revenue generation (what country in the world gives away public transportation?), thus tying your economic fate to basically taxes (which are a simple model as well) and some policies. Graphics are great, but the gameplay is the same as before.	-1
Quake for Dreamcast is a HUGE disappointment!!! The games has a useless, irrelevant single player on par with Outtrigger and since online in no longer available the game is all but virtually useless except if you have friends over. The game play is a little too fast and control on the controller (although it can be customised) is difficult. Aiming and tracking enemies becomes unbearably difficult with the controller and brings the game down more than anything else!! Nothing is more frustrating than trying to dodge and return fire through strifing, it is accomplished much easier in Outtrigger! Overall Quake Arena is a serious let down!! I have Quake 2 on my PC and enjoyed the single player missions which are in NO WAY found in Quake Arena! I was really excited to get this game as I read all the over-hyped reviews on this site and others...but my heart was broken by frustrating and frantic speeds coupled with annoying aiming or lack of aiming mechanism. I was first introduced to the genre through the multi-player Deathmatch of Rainbow 6: Rogue Spear on the DC and that was a much better experience with my friends. The idea of stealth, sniping, throwing grenades around corners and planting c4 all made that title a much better investment. Quake Arena lacks ALL that and exchanges it with fast running... shoot... run out of ammo... run... run... shoot with no strategy... run etc. You get the point. The game simply has you running VERY fast and struggling to process all the action. On the plus side the game has good graphics, sound and the ability to turn blood OFF...thats it the positives end there! My final word is simply this..."Look elsewhere for a good FPS"	-1
I rented this game with some of my friends mostly because I think Sonic is really cool and I thought this game would also be.  I couldn't believe it!  Besides this game being Mario Party with different characters it has a huge learning curve.  I will explain...Sonic Shuffle is basically a board game in which you get cards that have numbers from 1-6 & S (S is a random number from 1-7) in which you use to defeat enemies and screw up your oponents.  A gem is placed somewhere on the board and it is a race to the jewel...as soon as you reach the jewel you have to face an enemie that defends the gem and if defeated you win the gem.  The learning curve is not knowing where to go.  The computer knows exactly which way to go, and even shortcuts to the gem!  I'm not saying I am a sore loser but they could atleast make it an easier learning curve AND not have putten a N64 game onto a 128-bit system (mario party).  If you are looking for a fun party game, look else where and see what other 4-player games they have out for Sega Dreamcast.  Good luck shopping/browsing.	-1
Wow, what a let down.  Having played and enjoyed both Mario party games on the N64, I was looking forward to seeing what the dreamcast could do with a sonic board game. While Sonic and friends have never really reached the same level of character recognition as the Mario and Luigi crowd, I was hoping the graphic muscle of the DC would at least squeeze some light hearted fun out of Sonic Shuffle. What we found when we played for many hours last night was dissappointment and frustration. First, the graphics look just plain bad in my opinion.  The opening shots and menus look promising but the actual game screens made me think I had seen better on the N64.  In particular, some of the environmental effects like water looked awful, like the animations were running about 4 frames per second.  Very choppy and unpleasant to stare at while you are waiting  for the computer players to take their turns.  You can't turn them off by the way, so there is no such thing as short game.  Between that and the long load times, you can expect to be spending alot of time just sitting around yawning. It's the gameplay, stupid!  Even with lousy looks, this game could have emerged from the depths if it had good, engaging gameplay.  Instead, this is an example of what NOT to do in a video game.  Without going into great detail, I will say the the computer players cheat, the mini-games leave you with no control over your characters, and ultimately the complete random, unexplained nature of why and when things happen will make you feel like you are completely out of control of your character's fate.  You may as well just sit back and watch what happens, because nothing you can do will really effect anything. This game is one of the worst I have seen to come from the folks at SEGA, who recently have been putting out some fantastic games- Jet Grind Radio and Skies of Arcadia would make me buy my system all over again. I'm thinking that maybe Sonic Shuffle was made by some sub-team of developers working in some broom closet in the basement of the Sega building. They should be fired or sent back to game design school.	-1
Before I wanted this, I expected this to be a fun, entertaining experience.  Instead, I got this: bad AI, boring gameplay, and only 8 playable characters.  I expected more out of Sonic Shuffle.  On paper, Sonic Shuffle is great:  picking out cards, moving to spaces, and getting the most Precious Stones.  In practice, it is the opposite.  This is a very boring game, and with the AI, they can be very hard to beat, even on the Easy difficulty setting.  The game's story is horrible:  A fairy named Lumina asks the Sonic team to help her get Precious Stones and save everyone's dreams from Void.  Yeah, it's a baby story.  The graphics are suprisingly good.  The sound is so bad.  This game doesn't live up to its full potential.  Add minigames that are either frustrating or confusing, and you've got one of the worst games ever made.	-1
I am a fan of Sonic the Hedgehog.  I have been there for better and for worse (like when they added the super-annoying Amy Rose as a character).  I have always liked Sonic as a video game character.  Nonetheless, this game is awful. First of all, the premise of this game is stolen from the game Mario Party.  Cloned games can be alright, considering that the developers don't rely too heavily on the origial game for inspiration and design.  Sadly, the makers of Sonic Shuffle do exactly that--they rely completely on the design of Mario Party to patent their game after.  They make no attempt to hide the fact that they are copying off of Mario Pary.  And when game developers create a clone, it should be equal or better than the original, or else, they'll have to deal with the fact that not only did they not have the creativity to make their own game, but they could not even use the success of the game that was their predecessor to create a successful game in their own right.  Sonic Shuffle is a textbook example of this.  The game boards are pointless and poorly conceived.  The story behind the game is uninspiring, and does not catch the imagination.  The minigames are stupid, and not entertaining in the least.  I would avoid this game at all costs, unless you want to give someone free money for a useless piece of software.  Or maybe you could use the CD as a designer coaster or something.	-1
When I first read about Sonic Shuffle it got mixed reviews but since I was desperate for a new experience in gaming for the Dreamcast (the best system that never made it) I bought the game. I must say that it has sweet cel shading graphics and thats it! This game is really uninspired and tedious! My biggest gripe (among many) is that THE MULTIPLAYER GAMES ARE BORING, UNINSPIRED AND JUST PLAIN SUCK!!!!!!!!!!! I was origionally drawn to it by the boasts of many mulitplayer games but boy was I fooled! There are probably three (if so much) of these games that are fun, trust me the mini ames are BAD!! One game puts three players in a frying pan and the fourth player gets to turn it and toss it as if they are making pancakes, WEAK SEGA, WEAK! DO NOT BUY THIS MESS!!! IT IS NOT FUN!!! TAILS IS THE MOST ANNOYING CHARACTER EVER CREATED I HATE THE WAY HE ALWAYS HAS TO CALL SONIC FOR EVERYTHING!!! SOMEONE AT SEGA SHOULD GET A CAREER CHANGE AND GO INTO LICKING ENVELOPES AT THHE POST OFFICE, A JOB THAT REQUIRES LITTLE THOUGHT BECAUSE HE OBVIOUSLY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO PUT INTO SONIC SHUFFLE TO MAKE IT ORIGIONAL OR FUN!!	-1
I have Mario Party 1 and 2 and they came out befoe this. Sonic Shuffle is a mario party wannabe. The mini games stink on ice. And its pointless,all you do is pick a card and it walks by itself. If you wanna good sonic game get sonic adventure 2. This has bad graphics and takes a long time to play.	-1
I'm gonna get this out of the way right now: this game is aggravating. It starts off slow and does not pick up. I first got a taste of it at my friend's party last weekend. We were both pumped to play it and couldn't wait for other guests to arrive so we could have four people playing at once. Well, the excitement wore off as soon as we started playing. The game board was right out of Mario Party and didn't look too exciting. The mini-games were dull and too short. Before too long, the other guests watching were getting bored out of their minds. And so were the people playing. But it's not like we didn't give it a chance! We persisted. We wanted to like it! Then, my friend did us all a favor: he turned off. Sadly, the rest of the guests cheered. Not the sign of a good game. I'm sticking with board games.	-1
These Sega Sports games all suffer from the same problem: they rely on looks and not on gameplay. This game is repetitive drivel and I can't find a reason for recommending it. So I won't.	-1
Having just played Homeworld and not really enjoying it, I tried this one, the second game in the series (I bought all 3 at the same time. Shouldn't have done that.) And so far, I can't even get the game to play. I installed and uninstalled twice. I have downloaded updated drivers for NVIDIA GEFORCE FX 5200 128meg video card. I have changed all of the settings over and over again. And still can't play. I see the beginning story in the aftermath that follows the end of Homeworld, of them rebuilding. But as soon as I see the ship fly in on the first cutscene, I get kicked back to Windows. My recommedation is if you have XP, don't get this game. So far, it's more trouble than it's worth. So now I guess I will try Homeworld 2.	-1
Well, somehow they managed to make a follow-up that is not as good as the first. Please note that the people who made this sequal are NOT the people who made the original, even though Sierra handles the production. Pay attention to the negative reviews this game has received, many fans of the original feel a bit betrayed by this one. Yes, there are some tweaks that are good: waypoints for movement, you can make vessels fly around in circles, some different ships. However this game does NOT have the magnificent ambience of the original, the voice overs are sickeningly American-accented, it simply does not have anywhere near the class and atmosphere of the first. Don't get me wrong, it is a good game and if you are starving for more Homeworld then go for it, but don't expect the beauty of the original. If you do not have Homeworld, GET HOMEWORLD. It's better to enjoy the original first. You won't lose anything by playing that one first. Then play a demo of this one, and if you can stomach it, go for it. Sierra, get your act together and make some cheap original Homeworld mission packs, thanks, that would be well appreciated.	-1
This is by far one of the most boring RTS games I have ever played, and I have played alot of them. Just like in most RTS games, you have to collect resources. I spent most of my time waiting for the resource collectors to bring the resource. It was so boring. The single player mission was spent over half the time waiting. Waiting for resources. Waiting for your ships to build. Waiting for researches to finish. The graphics were ok, but given the fact this was a 1999 game, I can see where the graphics would have been pretty good though I believe Total Annihilation, Starcraft, and especially Age Of Empires (which all 3 came out before Homeworld) looked better. The ships looked cool, but if you zoomed in on them, they looked pixally. And the cutscenes were just ok. It was cool to be able to see a 360 view of every ship though. The battles weren't anything spectacular. You couldn't really see of hear any of the fighting going on. Just the same droning music over and over (the music was cool the first few missions, but gets rather boring later). It was also impossible to follow the battles as your camera follows one of units or the other. The best thing about this game was the story. The story goes like this: A spaceship was found buried in sand here on Earth. Using that technology and the history found on the ship, they built their own ships so that they could head to their real Homeworld. As the story unfolds and new enemies and friends are made, the story keeps this game going. At least for me, that is the only reason I continued to play this game. I read all of the reviews on many gamesites including Gamespot and Gamespy and many of the reviews here, and maybe my expectations were high, but one review said that no has since done what homeworld has done. And I believe the reason is who would want to. The idea about completely 3D space game is good in concept, but it takes away from the gameplay too much. This is definitely nothing like the games I mentioned before, but having played over 50 RTS games, this one didn't do it for me. Next up is Homeworld Cataclysm. I bought all 3 Homeworld games at the same time because the price was cheap. So I don't feel like I was cheated too much. Game wasn't for me, but maybe it is for you.	-1
i bougfht this game with great expectations, but i didn't like it in the least bit, its got an awsoem story lien and greta gameplay, i just don't liek 3drts, to you 2d rts fans, this is nothing liek a 2d rts, i found it very boring, and extremely annoying how the veiw system works..	-1
I got Perfect Dark for the N64 the day it came out and was actually surprised that it was better than I had expected. When I saw the same title for Gameboy, I figured it would be a portable version of the great N64 game. Boy, was I wrong. This is easily the worst game I own. The controls don't work, the sound isn't good, and the game play is horrible. Almost entirely the opposite of what the N64 game was. In fact, really the only thing in common between the two is the title and main character. In short, if you liked the N64 version, don't bother with this game. If you hated the N64 version, I suppose you might like this.	-1
When the Transfer Pak was initially introduced for the Nintendo 64, there were very few games that used it. Pok&eacute;mon Stadium and Mario Gold (see reviews) were the first ones, and Mario Tennis was coming. At the time, I had recently bought Perfect Dark for the N64, and I'd heard that the GBC version would use the Transfer Pak. Based on that, I bought the GBC game. Oops. My first mistake was expecting an N64-type experience from this game, and that's simply not possible. Perfect Dark was so good for the N64 that it couldn't be translated well for the Game Boy. However, it could still be a good game in its own right. Well, it's not. The controls, to say the least, are poor. It's difficult to aim, difficult to tell where you're aiming, hard to tell what's happening, hard to see where items are to pick up. It's just difficult to play. I couldn't even force myself to go through the first level. The sound is nothing spectacular, and while the cut scenes are interesting, the graphics themselves are poor. The cartridge also comes with a built-in Rumble feature, but that really doesn't add anything to the game other than weight. I can't recommend this game in any way, even for its ability to unlock features in the N64 game (which I couldn't find in the GBC manual and will accept on faith). It's simply not worth it. If you need to get into things in the N64 version, find some cheat codes on-line and save yourself some money.	-1
Martian Gothic is a cheap "Resident Evil" clone set on a space station, and boy does it live up to the motto "you get what you pay for"...  There is so much wrong with this game, it's hard to know where to start. I'm not talking about bad graphics or script, becasue those are actually quite good. I'm talking about sheer unplayability. Did anyone actually test this prior to release? First off, the game features 3D character movement on top of static scenery and fixed camera angles, which looks ok, but on several occasions, the angle you see actually masks significant information like a branching corridor, a cupboard or shelf, or even a door...which all but halts gameplay as you find yourself totally unaware of what to do next. Secondly, the puzzles are downright evil. There's no way you would be able to work out unaided what you are expected to do in some circumstances, and the sheer amount of items the player finds in the space station or has to carry around is very wide ranging - people who have played it will surely recall the most confusing ones as the  "babybug", the map featuring ants on a rock in the MOOD chamber, the stone heart, the syringes, the two screwdrivers...they all added up to one massive headache for me. Solving puzzles like these is not fun as far as I'm concerned, there are absolutely no pointers as to what you should do. Plus some items are actually functionless throughout the whole game, which in the case of keys (I finished the game with unused keys still in my inventory) is downright misleading.  Most worrying of all, there were several moments in the game where it simply did not work properly. Whether down to bugs or a faulty disc, I don't know, but I remember times when the screen would go blank between camera angle changes and ...stay blank. The game would freeze and only a re-boot would restore my poor PSX. Furthermore, on some occasions, monsters would appear from nowhere, or not even register point blank hits (I'm talking when they were SUPPOSED to, ok!). I have even read that the port over to the PSX from the PC version of the game missed out certain graphic effects that would otherwise have prompted the player to understand certain important points in the game - for example an invincible monster that had to be made vunerable before it could be killed was made in two different colours (before and after) in the PC version so that you could tell the difference - a luxury denied the humble PSX owner!!   The bottom line is that these problems combined make the game darn near impossible to complete without endless patience, psychic powers or a very good walkthrough. Shame really, because somewhere in here is a good idea trying to get out. There are three playable characters in this adventure, and the gimmick is that they are all infected with some space disease that means instant death should they ever actually meet each other. So, much gameplay revolves around solving puzzles that cannot be done by just one pair of hands...how to get three people through this death trap filled with zombies and mutant monsters, all co-operating, yet without ever being in the same room, is actually a great idea for a game. The graphics and soundtrack are fine...and the voices are very well done. I don't have a problem with the concept of Martian Gothic. But it has too many problems with it that ruin all the other good points. If anyone ever re-released it with all the bugs removed it would be great fun to play and a worthy purchase. As it stands, it's a total failure.	-1
Let me explain this game....  however bizzare it may be. Basicly you are some business tycoon building shops, renting different businesses, and getting rich. Perhaps some 60 yr old retired business man may enjoy this, but definately not the general public. However, it still has a good side.... starting shops, apartments, ect.. but that becomes boring and repetitive after about 1-2 hours. Definately not worth more than $5	-1
This game gets boring after an hour or two.  The interface is a bit confusing at the beginning.	-1

Step into the real world with a new and highly competitive version of Monopoly. This is not competitive like you roll the dice, see where you land, buy the property, then build houses once you get a monopoly. This is a game where at any given second you can lease a property from the city (where then it goes to auction instead of you just buying it) or you can build a residential or retail area without owning the land (you just rent it). It makes for some interesting things, such as someone will build lots of buildings on rented land, then another player will buy the land out from under them. Once you start enjoying the game, then it unfortunately ends, because this game goes in scenarios, not full-length games (like playing a demo that cuts off after 10 minutes). Its also very tedious, because its the same city over and over, so you basically go build the same stuff over and over. The scenarios sound basic (make 100 sales, earn $3000 profit in one day, reach an empire of $20,000, have the most money by 1945), but they are difficult at times because the game does not offer insights as to how to complete the scenarios. There are nice smooth 3D graphics to the game, but the tools to create buildings are troublesome.	-1
This game is very difficult for beginners to pickup. After playing the home version with the DC controler I realized how much I miss those twin sticks. Trying to get use to the controls takes a very long time and the pay off isn't worth it. Graphics are only as good as the arcade version (perfect port of the arcade visually), which is now dated. Hardcore Virtual On fans seem to like it a lot, everyone else should pass. There are better rewarding games that take less time to figure out. Oh yeah, where is the Internet play Activision?	-1
One of the biggest mistakes of my life was purchasing this travesty of computer programming. It runs terribly, and I have a new 533 system.  The time frame is not paced, and the options are not as smooth as the package  promotes.  Bad production indeed!  And the biggest factor that it fails to  anywhere close to fun.	-1
I am not much of a game expert, but I do know what I like to play. I decided I wanted the game because the concept of running my own airport would be fun. I even read a few of the reviews on amazon. My husband seen the game at [local store] including in a pack with other games. He only paid [some money] for the pack and I see why.  First the box said airport tycoon, but the cd saids Air Mogul. I guess it is the same game. When I first seen the graphics it was awful. I still thought there would be hope. The game play is not easy to understand and the game tutorial was worthless in fact it was mess up itself. I just didn't like it at all. I was very disappointed. So if you are just a person who like to play games just for the fun of it, and not one of those hard gamers don't waste your money on this game. It wasn't even worth a few dollars. Now one of the other games in the pack I am currently playing is RailRoad Tycoon 2 and it was definitely worth the few dollars.	-1
if your looking to play something similar to the amazing and legendary game chrono trigger.. this isn't it. its by far the furthest thing from it story line is not bad but the battle system is just a jumbled mess	-1
I purchased this to be a shelf ornament, never to be opened.  If that's not your thing then at $9.99 you really can't beat it for an amazing game.  But I already have an open copy and wanted a clean sealed copy.  The plastic on it looks like a repackage, is loose and almost falling off.  The box it was shipped in was extremely well cushioned to the point it wasn't sliding around inside yet the front was scratched and had holes in the plastic.  I can only assume this happened while being stored in the warehouse.  Bummed out but not worth the hassle to return.  So re-cap. + Great Game  - Even though new not collector condition	-1
Ordered a "new" copy of this and the second disc would not read. I returned it and ordered a new copy and AGAIN the second disc would not read consistently. Amazon must have bought a defective batch of these discs, this is really sad because I really wanted to play this game.	-1
I grew up with games such as Final Fantasy 3, Secret of Mana and, of course, Chrono Trigger.  When I first heard there was going to be a new game I freaked out, ran out and pre-ordered the game as soon as I could.  When I finally did get the game... It was one of the biggest let downs of my gaming life. You can't rightfully make a game, call it a sequal to one of the best SNES RPGs and then largely ignore the first game.  I played it, I beat it, and I felt very unsasfityed. This didn't scratch the itch I had for more Chrono Trigger goodness, why Square decided to ruin their franchise with with garbage is beyond me.	-1
In good  condition but does not save.	-1
this game does not save.  it also doesn't work half the time i try to play it.  it freezes in the menu screen.	-1
battery screw up made me sad I forgot to read that, game plays like it should. brings back the olden days, they need to do remakes for the new consols but as long as we can fix it at home with a new battery we will keep playing them!	-1
I have played almost every rpg ever made for almost all systems, thats how long I've been a gamer and Chrono Trigger will always be in my top five, not for the story but just for sure fun-factor and inventiveness. In hindsight, I don't actually believe Chrono Trigger is nearly good as I once did when I was a kid, but it still blows this game out of the water.  I didn't hate this game either, don't get me wrong, but its just not there. The graphics for the time were amazing I suppose and the battle system is different(often to the point of annoyance), but different isn't always good. They tried to create a plotline as lofty and intricate as something like Xenogears. You go to so many places and meet WAAAAAAY too many party members to the point where they all seem to lose their respective "face." You only really need the first two main party members and then pick one more from the other gazillion to form your party. Honestly, I thought the choice to add so many potential members was quite stupid. Also, I feel the storyline is too confusing. Havign beat this game a few years ago I remember almost nothing of what actually happened except for the fact I had already forgotten about most of it before I was even doen with the game, which usually doesn't mark a very enthralling affair in my eyes.  Many people love this game, and I suppose if you try to play it as a game set apart from the Chrono "franchise," as it were, it is a fair stand-alone outing. The Chrono tag is merely a means to an end, however, it is there to sell the game. This game has nothing to do with the original except in name and the use of timetravel. I would not recommend this game as a good rpg to start off on if you've never played one before. If you want the best of the best rpg's then go pick up Persona 3, FF7/FFX/FFXII, Xenogears, Star Ocean, or Suikoden 2/3/5, to name a few. This one can easily be bypassed.	-1
Please promise me you will never play this.  It is not worth your time.  If you paid money for it, try to find the person you gave that money to and kick them in the shin.  Hard.  Then throw your copy of this game in the dumpster.  Seriously though, this game is absolutely terrible.  The graphics are bad even for the PSX, the combat quickly becomes boring as all hell, the story line was confused and the fact that there was a second dimension pointless.  There was no reason for there being 40 something characters, most of them were exactly the same statwise, and all of them were poorly designed.  The most annoying thing in the world, bar nothing, is having to re-equip all your character's spells whenever you switch characters.  You have like 50 spell slots.  God.  I don't think I even need to say it, but those crumbums at Square couldn't pull another hit out of their oversized victorian tophats if they wanted too.  They should really stick with straight to video Final Fantasy 7 anime movies from now on, lest they risk making something like this again.	-1
This game falls short when it comes as a sequel to the illustrious Chrono Trigger.  The weaknesses/strengths with this sequel are as follows: Story & Characters: No connection is made to Chrono Trigger until well into the game, also very few characters from the original CT are mentioned, or shown.  Espeically the sorceror Magus (you do see a passing mention to his real name in a letter to Kid, thats it, o and he may be one of two guys in the game), not too mention they got his sister Schala's face structure and skin color ALL wrong at the end.  Also the first ending is quite weak and dumb. The 40 character roster is ridiculous, having this many characters stresses quantity rather than quality.  Many of the 40+ characters have no personality (besides an accent or odd way of speaking) or story or plot threads behind them.  Most of the characters in this game have no individuality. The sory is somewhat confusing (as well as the two Dimensions, see below) as its hard to keep straight what happens between the two nearly-identical worlds. On Dimensional Travel: The dimensional travel back and forth between worlds would of been great, that is if Square would of put at least a little bit of distinction between the two worlds so they do not look nearly identical (perhaps give different continental shapes as in the first CT).  This adds for a lot of confusion when you are completing tasks when going back and forth between worlds. Levels & Magic: Instead of leveling up (like in normal RPGs) you gain stars for defeating bosses.  So the game leaves you wondering if you ever got stronger at all or if you ever will.  Also magic is not learned it is assigned by "color".  And this gives the game even more of a completist "pokemon" feel (not too mention the 40+ characters) by classifying the characters all by color, again ruining any chance of individuality between characters.  About the only individuality characters have are different tech skills. Sound & Music: The opening, well-orchestrated theme "Scar Of Time" will blow you away.  The other music in this game is very well done, some of it being slight remixes or remade versions of music in the original CT (except this time its played with real instruments and not synthesized).  There is one point in the game however where you will want to turn down the volume. Although accompanient lacks in some areas (like the acoustic guitar themes) the sound overall is great. Graphics & Animation: Absolutely breathtaking!  The animation for the spells during battle are well detailed and flow very smoothly, this section along with the sound are the game's strong points. The game for a hardcore CT player (I swear I played Chrono Trigger so much I had every detail memorized) is somewhat below average.  For one thing there are too many characters (keeping it at 10 max would of been fine), secondly this game was developed to begin with not as a sequel to CT but rather for a Japanese Satellite System called BS where players in Japan can play together (it was called Radical Dreamers back then), and many of the developers and designers said in interviews it is not a true CT sequel (if we are lucky the loyal CT fans might see a real sequel, we can dream cant we?). The bottom line is if you never played CT you'll enjoy this game.  But if you are like me and were expecting a good sequel to a great game youll be disappointed like me, for some of the many reasons Ive stated above.	-1
...Being a fan of the legendary Chrono Trigger, I was enthralled by the coming of this game.  "Chrono Cross" is actually not a true sequel (as said by the creators), but originally a game called "Radical Dreamers."  Anywho, this game DID NOT live up to my expectations at all.  Read on to see why.  THE GOOD First of all, the graphics are actually quite colorful.  The backgrounds are well colored and animated.  The battle graphics also flow quite well.  Even if some of the characters are not all that great, they are nicely created.  However, these are the only good points I can say about the game.  THE BAD About the characters: there are about 40 characters jammed into this game and they virtually have no personality.  It's like the creators wanted to boast about the character quantity as opposed to MEMORABLE, AWESOME characters that we play the game for.  Who cares about 40 characters?!  The music: The remixes of Yasnuori Mitsuda's themes from CT are actually excellent, but the rest of the game's music is strictly mediocre.  Quite a shame, considering the same musical composers from CT are here.  The battle system many have boasted about is not that great at all; You virtually don't even level up.  It's pretty much a Final Fantasy Materia/Xenogears combination of a battle system, but it comes off very heavyhanded (not to mention the colors are annoying).  THE UGLY The critical point about this game is the fact that it doesn't really transcend well into CT.  The Glenn here is NOT Frog (as many have said), and is a very vindictive character that we quickly dismiss.  Schala was VERY MESSED UP at the end of the game, being blonde and in different physical shape.  Lavos was supposedly killed in CT and yet, he somehow survives... something which the game doesn't even explain it well at all.  Which leads to the worst part about the game: the storyline.  What could've been a unique storyline is muddled by inconsistencies and loopholes (examples: humans evolved after apes, BUT in CT, the people were human LONG BEFORE Lavos entered Earth; Lucca supposedly gave up her purpose in life, that is creating machines, to be the head of an orphanage, which goes against Lucca's character.  She also talks about regrets, which contrasts the more confident Lucca from CT; The game states that Guardia was destroyed and the Masamune was stolen, but why even bother when it doesn't even appear as ruins in the game??).  AND THE ULTIMATE SIN... Robo appears in the game VERY BRIEFLY, and once you find him, he dies!  He was my favorite character in CT (in a close race with Frog) and killing him off like a worthless character was the ultimate sin.  Speaking of Frog, the game assumes that he died and the Masamune was stolen from him.  OVERALL If you take away the references to CT, it doesn't hurt nearly as much, but it's still a rather generic RPG.  RPG fanatics no doubt love this game (which is why this game is very overrated) and I would've given it three stars.  However, since it blatantly defies the CT legend with a muddled storyline, unappealing characters, merely average music, and just for being VASTLY OVERRATED... this game doesn't deserve anything above 2 stars.  You'll hate me for this, but I demand that an RPG has a decent storyline, a decent battle system, and appealing characters.  This game fails in all three departments.  ONLY GET THIS GAME IF YOU'RE AN RPG FANATIC.  Otherwise, pass it on, ESPECIALLY if you are a fan of the classic Chrono Trigger.  On a closing note, don't get me wrong, people; The majority of Squaresoft's games are excellent.  The point I am trying to make (by the statement at the very beginning) is that there are TOO MANY fans out there that are blindly devoted to the company; they make hits and misses like everyone else.  Fortunately, this is one of their few misses.	-1
this game looks good, and the story is great but the game does not deliver the goods. The problem I have most with the game is serge the main character never talks, that is just plain lazyness you just get the feeling that serge is just  lifeless and is not intristing at all. Since the game has so many characters in it, it seems that most of the other characters as lifeless as serge and have no pointe in ever bieng introduced to the plot. I feel thair is a limit to the number of characters in a game that will still make the game intristing. And I am sorry Game Informer, but this game does not restore my faith in the modern RPG(you have to read thair great magazine to know what I am talking about) Square could do better, I have seen it done.	-1
When i first saw this game i thought "since i only have a PS1 this would be good "  but when i played it. it was just a shooter game nothing like the original star trek or star trek next generation or any of the others i mean none of there ships were in any of the other shows at all. Its just a star wars game ina a star trek disguise. I'v got nothing wrong with star wars but when you want a star trek game you don't want star wars.  The other probablm is that i cant get past mission 5 i'v played over 9 hours trying to beat it! I looked up cheats and their is only one: beat all levels and all wepons and some other stuff. I'm really disapointed. A better game is star trek encounters for PS2!!	-1
This game has an extensive bunch of moves, maneuvers, special items, secrets and it has a huge amount of Spiderman memorabilia in it. This is a very detailed Spiderman game because it is a whole 3D world, you as Spiderman or one of his six playable alter egos can swing from building to building, hang upside-down, create a web shield, web the band guys or create web boxing gloves. Everyone is included, like Venom, Carnage, the Scorpion, Rhino, and a 50 ft Mysterio. You must beat them each in a unique way, rather than just beating them up. There are twenty-five levels, however, the big downfall is that you can beat the game from beginning to end in only two or three hours, which makes it like a movie. To add playability to the game you can pick up secret outfits, characters, 3D profiles on bad guys and even comicbook covers documenting the history of the comic.	-1
The guy who sold it to me said the battery was working and it wasn't and because of that while I was in the middle of the game it somehow moved the battery out of place so I had to start all over again.	-1
Game was not in working condition as indicated by the used-very good status. The save battery was dead. Indicated this to the seller. Seller advised purchasing a battery kit.	-1
the game doesnt save	-1
I was in the mood for some nostalgia, but the game won't save. I have to start over every time I play it. I'll still play it every now and then	-1
The game played but it was unable to save a file without corrupting it every time so that was b.s.	-1
Whoa, were do I start. This game was by FAR the worst turok game EVER. The graphics are horrible(except for the talking), caracters from previous turoks come back and look COMPLEATLY different. I mean, not even remotly close. The sound is okay. The music is all the same though. Lets see,gameplay. The AI is horible. The enemy stands there and shoots at you. Unlike its previous game, where the Dinosoids would hide behind crates and throw grenades, or self distruct, ect. The guns are like worse versions of T2s guns. The only gun I like is the hardest gun to get. The story line is bland. Nothing really happens. It has nothing to do with all the othe turok games. All of a sudden, things just happen. Over all, it seems the game had a lack of intrest when they made it. Notice Iguana(who made the other two turok games) didn't make this one. Tells you something just by that.	-1
Graphics look ok, sound's ok, but I for one do not wish to spend a few hours studying the manual before being able to play a game.  And even then it's a drag to input all your commands and having to return all your troops and credits to the staging area at the end of each mission!	-1
First, let me say that I whole-hearedly agree with the review by Tiberius. Back in the glory days of Counter-Strike (2001-2002), this game was the be-all end-all for 1) Online video games, 2) First-Person Shooters, 3) PC Games, and 4) Any video game basically. It had real-life weapons, the graphics were superb at the time, the maps were extremely well-made, the system requirements are still obscenely low, and damnit it was fun. Then, inevitabely, the hands of time began to take their ruthless, indiscriminate toll. Video cards supported better graphics, new (and yes, better!) games came out (Battlefield 1942, Unreal Tournament 2004), hacking became the unmistakable poison of Counter-Strike, and a lot of the cool, casual gamers grew up or moved on. From 2000 to 2004, Counter-Strike went from an utter joy to a sensation to a fading diamond to a nuisance. By 2004 to present day, it has become a problem. Great games and great game developers are losing tons of money because people are still playing this game after five years on their mom's worn-out 640 Megahertz Pentium III PCs running Windows 98. Counter-Strike is still one of the most popular games of all-time, with a ridiculous number of people playing it on average a day, because people just don't seem to have enough self-control to give up their hopeless addiction.  Today, server admins are, for the most part, humorless dictators, and will not stand for anything that deviates from this game's undeniable, monotonous drone. People are still playing the same maps from the 1.0 release, that have completely lost all their zest and initial potential. It always feels as if I've played the same round a thousand times before, and I probably have. Even the custom maps are sickening in their monotony. fy_iceworld is fun for 3 consecutive seconds. Many other popular custom maps in heavy server rotation are the same way, and all look disguisting. I've played on probably over 500 servers, and downloaded probably over the same amount of *quality* custom maps, and not more than 3 have I ever seen a server run in its rotation, or voted on by the players. Furthermore, people are still playing the game using dial-up, and CS veterans are always complaining about camping, even if its a tactic used to complete the objective. As far as the objectives are concerned, Counter-Strike has basically become a deathmatch game. No one will listen to anyone's plan (on the rare occasion there is one), no one tries to rescue the hostages, and everyone always calls someone a "p***y" or "nub" if you use the auto shotgun or AWP. And to top it all off, Valve cancelled the outstanding won.net and replaced it with this Steam garbage, a utility soaking wet with incompetence.  L337 Speak has also gained mass popularity to the jaded Counter-Strike culture, and has become its own incessant frustration. But I won't even get into that. If you're new to CS, don't bother, veterans of this game are far from friendly, and you'll probably get called a bunch of names involving lots of zeroes and threes if you're a beginner. For now, if you want to indulge yourself in a great online game, check out World of Warcraft, Battlefield 1942, Sven Co-Op, or even Team Fortress Classic (a dated game with an *awesome* community that has yet to lose its initial charm).	-1
I'll make this short and sweet for you.  I went to a cyber cafe so I can play this "gem" and see what all the fuss is about on this game.  OVERRATED.  I have no idea how people prais this as "THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!!"...How silly, This game is just plain average..  If you wanna play a nice Game from Valve..I don't need to tell you but I'll give you a hint....H***f L*fe...This game is just pure garbage and the Online is boring...And I don't need your flaming or bashing just cause One mans opinion differs from yours..  The good  Visuals are good I guess  Bad  Very Mediocer  Plain boring combat...Nothing new  Online isn't that great  Extreamly Overrated...TRUST ME..  Gets boring after awhile  And yes I played this out for more then an 1hour...2 bucks I'll never get back  2.1 out of 5 stars....  Extreamly Overrated, Not worth my 2 bucks, and that's all I got to say....  Peace	-1
I give credit to the graphics but this game is no different then most Multiplayers...I played this at a computer/arcade place er what ever there called nd I didn't like the game that much... The gameplay is alright but Nothing special....BUT IT IS FUN WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING WITH FRIENDS I CAN TELLYOU THAT But over all it's very overrated...	-1
Counter-Strike is a spectacular mod for a spectacular game.  Half-Life, though somewhat outdated now, is still one of the best FPS games ever made.  The gameplay is superb, and the mods that have spawned from the game are great in their own right.  Counter-Strike is one of those great mods.  Counter-Stike is so great, that Sierra decided to sell a retail version of the game.  This is why I am giving this only one star, in spite of the spectacularness of the game.  Go to pretty much any website where games can be downloaded, and you can get this game, provided you have Half-Life, for free.  Yes for free.  The file however, is fairly large, but even so, it is probably worse to buy a game you can get for free than it is to leave a slow internet connection on all night so you can get this game.  Basically, this game is great, and though it is worth the price, it is still available for free, so that price isn't worth it.	-1
I don't know why Sierra really bother to repack Half-Life in yet ANOTHER version! What else are they going to do? A Halflife Pack with Counterstrike, Day of Defeat, and Action all in one? This is a waste! A waste of time and money, for Sierra and the consumers! I'm only talking about the product, Counter-Strike is actually not a bad mod, since about 90% of the Half-Life gaming community plays it, there is no room for other mods. This is bad for the people that are tired of Counterstrike and are looking for something new. Buying Half-Life by itself is cheaper, you can download Counterstrike for free anyway.	-1
NOT a single player game net only. [stinks] if you cant get a fast connection.	-1
The frist tribe's wus awesome but this one is full of bug's for instance if you acidently hit the windows key your computer it locks up and the only thing you can do is a hard restart and as long as it has been out they still have not fixed it. P.S. this is a common problem and everyone i know bought it and won't play it for this reason..........................	-1
I'm an avid FPS (first person shooter) fan, and I was very much looking forward to playing Tribes 2.  I'd read many glowing reviews and heard lots of buzz about the game.  Unfortunately, after three separate attempts to get through the tutorial, I was hopelessly bored with the game and annoyed with the physics engine.   Bottom line is that this is a complex game that is probably a lot of fun for people who are big into teamplay and resource management, but if you're a die-hard shooter fan like me, I think you'll find that this game's lack of polish and emphasis on complexity is not your cup of tea.	-1
If you have a Voodoo card (don't believe the box which says it is 3dfx compatable), don't buy this game regardless of your machine specs. I am using a Voodoo5500  and I am lucky if I get 20fps out of it(not unplayable,but not worth it either). The game is so fogged in, that you might as well be playing indoors. It does play ok over the internet though. If you have an Nvidia card(Geforce,Geforce2,TNT) you will probably have better luck. I really liked the first Tribes and thought this one would follow in its footsteps.	-1
I will give an honest review and personal opinion that makes sense. I love playing these first person shooter games and I play things like Unreal Tournament and counter-strike and rogue spear most frequently. I was expecting a great game from what I read on reviews and from word of mouth on the internet (can you really trust it?). I have a P3-667 Mhz with 128 MB of RAM using a Voodoo5500 AGP card.  The game runs pretty decent going on 800x600 (16-bit) on Direct3D mode.  However, OpenGL is a different story.  Even on 640x480, it was really choppy and unplayable.  Although the graphics looked superb in OpenGl,  this game is a machine hog, as everyone has stated earlier. This game sort of reminds me of Team Fortress Classic and how everyone needs to work together. Problem is, nobody does.  Everyone just runs around shooting and killing anything.  I played on several servers and there is no team work as people mention about.  Even though it's a team based game, team work is not there because everyone wants a piece of there own action.  So it was not fun in that sense.  The weapons, to me personally, are like 'whatever'.  They just shoot plasma, lasers, rocket, etc.. and you just hit people.  People are just flying and driving vehicles everywhere and turrets are firing everywhere.  For some reason, this game just wasn't fun.  Sure, I got the hang of the game farely quick, but I found myself wanting to play Counter-Strike instead.  The thrill is just not there as in Counter-strike. As for technical problems - none for me.  Everyone else, on [...] on the forum have so many problems.  But I have not seen any serious problems on my computer.  My personal recommendation is to wait for this game to drop in price and get Counter-strike, if you haven't done so all ready.	-1
After the very classic Super NES title "Super Castlevania IV," Konami released another Super NES game in the form of "Dracula X."  I'm not sure whether the Genesis game "Bloodlines" preceded it or not, so I'm not going to make any judgments in terms of which came first.  I will, however, state that Bloodlines is a FAR better game than this... thing.  It's extremely rare nowadays and for good reason.  Here's the lowdown: THE GOOD The graphics are VERY GOOD FOR THE SYSTEM.  They are ALMOST, OH SO CLOSE to the graphics represented in Playstation's "Symphony of the Night."  I'm not kidding.  Unlike some other reviewers, I liked the level designs; they weren't perfect, but they certainly weren't terrible.  Unfortunately, these are practically the only two things I can say positive about the game.  Wait, three things: It's rare, so many people didn't waste their money with this.  Ha.  Didn't think I'd find another one, did you? THE BAD Oh man, with so much potential you'd think this would be a classic with its storyline that links to Symphony and its high-quality graphics and level design.  The bad comes crashing down on this one; you play as Richter Belmont (like in Symphony), but the whip doesn't twirl around (it only stays straight) AND IT NEVER UPGRADES OR CHANGES WHEN YOU DIE.  I could've spared this game some dignity with the lack of movement for the whip, but why did they make it to where it's always the same?!  That's going against Castlevania tradition!  You've always been able to change your whip and why this game doesn't is beyond me.  Also, the music is very subpar, mostly consisting of rambling techno noise and heavy metal-ish music (which normally would've pleased me...) that doesn't really go anywhere.  Richter also walks VERY SLOWLY, almost like the Game Boy titles, and the jumping is horrid here.  It's almost as bad as controlling your character in the N64 Castlevania's.  I can't emphasize how bad this is.  BAD, BAD, BAD. OVERALL I HIGHLY -DO NOT- RECOMMEND THIS.  I'm a huge Castlevania fan and I even know not to buy this game.  If you do buy it, get it for a decent price.  I saw this store have it for 80 bucks with a torn label AND CARTRIDGE ONLY.  My friends, Super Castlevania IV was FAR BETTER than this piece of plastic.  Ultimately, this game had great potential but it comes off as rushed and uninspired.  I hate to bash on a Castlevania game, but I had to. I also noticed (and apparently reviewer Ted did as well) that many Castlevania fans seemed to like this over Bloodlines.  I can't fathom a reason why since Bloodlines is a better game.  Sometimes, you people make me sick.	-1
This was a let down indeed,all graphics nothing more. The controls are downright horrible ,you can't use your whip multi-directional like you could with (CASTLEVANIA BLOODLINES AND SUPER CASTLEVANIA)and he walks slow in this game,even the special double requires you to mash the buttons. Also whats going on with all the jumping I feel like I'm on the 8th level on Super Mario Bros,not a Castlevania game,the difficultly was unpleasant and the level design was unforgivable. In addition what who ruined the Castlevania music with this techno garbage,unless you like gay techno(which is all techno by the way)you will be looking for a mute button. THIS IS A RARE AND UNHEARD CASTLEVANIA FOR A REASON,IT FLATOUT STINKS,GET CASTLEVANIA BLOODLINES OR SUPER CASTLEVANIA OR EVEN S.O.T.N IF YOU HAVE A PLAYSTATION BUT AVOID DRACULA X,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED	-1
While i do like the PS 2 line up of games the system itself i have lost all confidence in.  My first two PS 2's (the old bigger version) died from the disc read error problem.  I thought maybe in the new design this problem was addressed since the laser lens is more easily accesible and you'd think that would make it easy to clean it and stuff.  Well the new slim i bought a year ago just stopped reading discs to and i tried to clean the laser lens and it has no effect whatsoever.  I have bought 3 playstation 2's in the last 4 years.  If i buy another one it will be my 4th in 4 years and will bring up my total spent on new PS 2's to about 800 dollars.  More then it costs to buy the upcoming PS 3 on a much lesser system.  Conveniently they die on me after the warranty is gone.  I have 200 games that are all dust collectors now cause i refuse to buy another PS 2 again.  They have no durability whatsoever and the life of the systems i have owned seems to be just over a year on each.  Thats not acceptable.  I take good care of my systems and it doesn't matter.  With time the PS 2's just stop reading discs for whatever reason.  Then they want you to buy another one or ship it somewhere to be fixed (and charge you for it of course).  If it was an isolated thing with one faulty system i would have no problem with it.  But when all three systems i buy die from the same exact problem thats not acceptable.  Theres an obvious flaw in the building of this system and Sony simply refuses to address it and fix the problem where it starts in manufacturing.  Because people keep flocking to the store to but them Sony won't bother to fix it cause as long as they see profits that translates to them as being no problem with the system.  My advice is to avoid Sony console systems until they one day show they can create one with some durability.  Especially with the new PS 3,if that one ends up having the same flaw as this system its going to cost alot more to keep replacing.  For the time being Sony systems are a bad investment.  They just don't have long lasting durability.  My original Nintendo lasted longer then all 3 of my PS 2's combined which is pretty sad considering that the first nintendo had a bad reputation for durability.	-1
Bad language	-1
I'm getting a screen tearing/rendering issue. I assume this console was untested. I learned my lesson. I wouldn't recommend buying used consoles if you cant talk to the seller. I tested 2 different video cables (component and composite) with multiple games. So far i'm 2/2 from receiving broken consoles. First the original xbox now a ps2.	-1
I used to like syphon filter, so I got this game jus to trythe newerversion of it.. aand itwasn't myfeel anymore! a good game for syphon fans, (ifya STILL like it..) but.. not for me!	-1
I got this game after purchasing a PS3, thinking that even if this game wasn't all that great, I could use the two microphones (which came with a USB adaptor) for Karaoke Revolution games.  I was wrong.  Because the microphones are not actual USB mics and have to plug into a USB adaptor, Karaoke Revolution games do not detect these "SingStar" mics.  Secondly, SingStar does not give you the option to remove the lead vocals from the songs.  This defeats the whole purpose of Karaoke.  Even on Karaoke mode, the lead vocals are still there.  Lastly, The game has a very small selection of songs, and there are a handful of tracks that are "medleys", which are basically a medley from choruses of the same songs that are already on this game.  Conclusion.  This is NOT a Karaoke game, as it does not give you the option to strip the lead vocals, and the microphones included with the game are not compatible with any other games for the PS2 or PS3.  If I was given the option, I would give this game ZERO stars.	-1
This would be a great game, had Konami already not released five (six when the American Idol one comes out) better Karaoke games for the PS2. You would think that when releasing this game in 2006, Sony would look at its competition and make it equal or better. They did not. I apologize that so much of the review is comparing it to the Karaoke Revolution series, but it's a natural comparison, and unfortunate for Singstar Rocks, as SR is by far an inferior product.  I have a lot of the same complaints as others. There are no unlockables. Even though KR's strange costumes are seldom used in our household, it's nice to see things being unlocked as you sing more and better. Singstar Rocks does not do this.  The big thing is with the PS2 having two standard USB ports, why they would utilize the mini to USB adapter. This renders the mics useless to the KR games. If they're worried about being able to use an EyeToy simultaneously to two mics, maybe they should have included a USB mini hub instead. It infuriates me that with all the decent USB mics on the market that Sony again would go proprietary (of sorts).  Another complaint is the lack of adjustments. In song, KR (dating back to the original) allows you to adjust the vocals, mic and music. Singstar Rocks has only a master volume that doesn't see to do much.  It's also unfortunate that Sony stuck with only Sony artists, as they are missing out on a ton of others. The song selection is very random due to this and a couple are very strange selections to have on a sing along disc. There are multiple songs on here that do not make a lot of sense. Of all the Rolling Stones catalog, why would Forty Licks' "Paint it Black" be the one to appear. Lame!  In a vacuum, the game is fun, but its song selection, lack of options and its proprietary options all make it fall extremely short to any of the other Karaoke Revolution. Don't waste your time with this one. Get *any* of the KR series over this one.	-1
....this product did not work, guessing it was just an isolated bad part but the return process was not worth the trouble or money spent	-1
Came in horrible condition, fortunately needed the bios only. Not as described tho.	-1
This item did not come in a box with any plugs or controller. I am very disappointed. Not sure if it even works yet, have to wait for plugs to come now.	-1
I'd give this game 0 stars if that was possible. The graphics were pretty good, yes. But if you've played one level in this game, don't get frustrated about not getting far, they're all the same. I played this for 5 minutes, thought wow this is cool, played it for 5 more, and realized how much it really ...(stunk). Waste of $, don't let anybody pay you to buy it, or rent it for that matter.	-1
Before playing this game you should play the preceding title of the series "The Mark of Kri" which is a truly fantastic game. It introduces a beautiful atmospheric world, unique controls, great action, and an interesting story. One of the best title's I've played for the PS2.  That said, I have a bone or two to pick with the sequel here. I really wanted to give this game a shining review but I have to be honest with you. For the record I found this game to be quite beautiful like MoK and the controls were very much alike. I became accustomed to fighting alongside a computer controlled ally and learned to like it. I played as the new characters and came to like them too.  The painful things about this game are the bugs/glitches! I've played a lot of PS2 titles, I can safely say that even among the worst titles I've played, none of them had this many bugs. What happened Sony? Did you pull the plug on this one and rush it to store shelves? Here's a list of bugs I have experienced commonly in this game:  1. In stealth mode, half the time, enemies somehow magically see you when you're completely concealed around a corner. 2. Floors disappear and stay gone during play, and make you appear as if you are walking on air. Sounds cool but it isn't. It's sloppy. 3. Sometimes when you flip a switch and you computer ally attempts to flip it too, door jam closed instead of opening for you. 4. Your character gets stuck in a wall sometimes permanently. 5. When attempting to complete level challenges such as completing certain combos on enemies, the correctly and successfully performed combos will go undetected after dozens of attempts. (this one really irks me) 6. You computer controlled partner freezes in place 7. The entire game freezes.  It's heartbreaking really. I love the series and the story but I can't help but get really frustrated at the sloppy programming behind this game. I expect more from Sony, especially since MoK was such a wonderful game. Try it at the very least.	-1
I thought it's ok until the bugs start to happen very often that it just became so annoying. The game freezes alot! This doesn't happen with any of my other 50+ games, so I know my console works fine. No wonder I was able to buy this game brand new for only $5...it's garbage!	-1
This is a very unique game, as you compete as a unicycle! Does that sound bad or what? You compete in four circuits, each having five different races. The races are head to head races, time races, and trick competitions. Yes tricks, to go faster in this game, you must do a trick, like a backflip, front flip, rotating flip, or several combinations of tricks to earn points and to go faster. The game is very fast paced and it will raise your reflexes just playing it, or it will make you really dizzy because of the backgrounds to the race levels. This game is also played from a side view like a Mario game.	-1
didnt work	-1
I got this on the cheap thinking that it would be a decent racing game. I was wrong. I didn't know what to expect, but cars that handle EXTREMELY unrealistically, graphics that are just average in my eyes (compared to NFS 2 Hot pursuit and GT 3) and a general unexpected hardness in gameplay made me sorry I got this game. The cars are fake, which isn't too much of an issue but you have to make the fake cars good. If you're looking for a fun racing game with realistic cars, go for Need For Speed 2: Hot Pursuit, and if you want a good driving sim, go for Gran Turismo 3. Rent this if you must, but don't spend a lot of money for it.	-1
When i first got this it was hard. Then i played it more and more, I used the slowest car and i beet the game in about 3-4 hours. The game is to short, when you beet it all you have are the time attacks and the races were you try to beet a fake computer guys(time attack). And how the hell do you get medls!	-1
This game was just a reminder to me why I switched from Ridge Racer to Gran Turismo.  The graphics are decent especially in the replay but thats it.  The controls are horrible and if the announcer would show himself on the track I would gladly run over him.  The game itself has 14 courses (that includes the reverse)and 18 different cars.  But there are only 2 different views to choose from.  When I bought this I was excited and thought it was the racing game that was going to hold me over till Gran Turismo 3 comes out but I was wrong.	-1
RR V came with my PS2 bundle so I can't say I wasted money on it. I was just happy to finally get a PS2. Anyway, the graphics are amazing as you would come to expect on the PS2 platform. The music is fantastic. There are some awesome techno tracks. The car selection is cool. You can even choose a little modified Honda Civic Hatchback. I have played this game for about two months, off and on as I get bored with my sports games (madden, fifa, etc...) and it is decent. I am not a big car racing person so I guess my review is a little more negative than most but this one just has more negatives than positives. I hate the following: 1) The announcer is lame. The whole deal is some radio DJ announcing the race coverage in a "So Cal" voice. I thought I had one of the members of Blink 182 in my TV...Dude! 2) The steering sucks. I like to have a car that hugs the curves not one that slides around like a pig in mud on a rainy day in July. 3) The car never gets damaged. I hit a wall going 110 and the car just slides off...wish my real car did that. 4) The game is hard, but hey I already told you I am not into car games. I will take you on in Madden any day of the week! My advise: Rent before you buy!	-1
The RR series has always been sort of self-explanatory.  Realistic looking cars in a realistic environment, but playing like an arcade racer.  No great amount of depth (like the Gran Turismo series) but not quite as cartoony as Beetle Adventure Racing or Top Gear Overdrive. This is just more of the same.  Is it the best looking RR ever?  Yeah, and it should be, given that its the only PS2 version of the bunch.  And, truth be told, it should look better.  It does score above-average marks in the style department, but the highly Japanese flavor to it might turn off some gamers.  Basically it is what it is: another Ridge Racer game.  Type 4 was good for PSX, and a lot of people expected more from this one, but didn't get "the next level" of RR games, just another in a series. If you want a decent racing game, wait for Gran Turismo 3, or if you've been a RR devotee, then by all means go for this one.  For most gamers it's a "been there, done that" kinda thing.	-1
I really, truly, do not understand how Settlers has managed to get to a fourth release. I would have thought this game would have died out after the first. Everything about the game is annoying and confusing. You need to produce all sorts of resources from different spots, and it's not clear when you need to produce something you're not. This can lead to a lot of head-scratching while you try to figure out why exactly your miners aren't mining. You really don't have that much control of the individual units the way you do in almost every good strategy game. The combat is dull and not particularly tactical, and the graphics are pretty dated. Most of all, this game just isn't fun. It feels more like a tutorial in a free market economy than a game! Pick up Civ 3 or Age of Empires 2 if you want an historical strategy game.	-1
It has that bulder's gate blahh feel to it.  Very slow moving.  I have an extremely high-end system and it moves very slowly, just as bulder's gate does.  What is the fascination with that style of game???  Sure it uses ad&d rules but it does it so gruelingly slowly!...  Anyway, I played Arcanum for a day and the novelty of the ability to fire a gun in an RPG wore off due to the terrible interface.  Top that off with the ... quality of the Sierra name (it's become apparent they rush developers into releasing buggy low-quality software with cool packaging - cheers to their marketing company!) and you're looking at one crummy game.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.	-1
I hate writing negative reviews.  I like writing positive reviews about things that have entertained or educated me, but sometimes something gets me frustrated enough that I feel obligated to inform others. While I normally start with complaints, I feel it necessary to start with the good things about Arcanum.  Arcanum has the potential to be one of the coolest games ever made.  It has an original story, an immersive world with colorful characters, and a variety of playing styles to suit anyones prefernces. Unfortunately, all of these positive things are shrouded in one of the buggiest pieces of code that has ever come across my PC.  Characters and Items either fail to appear, or disapppear for no apparent reason making the main plot impossible to further.  It's one thing to get stuck in a little subplot, but it's another thing to get stuck in the middle of the story simply because of technical errors. I spent hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong at times, only to visit the game forum at the official site and find message after message complaining about "bug this" and "fix that".  The current patch has done nothing to help me.  I think my bugs maybe a little worse than others, but almost everyone has experienced at least minor bugs and glitches. If this were some impulse buy I would have just given up and moved on to something else, but Arcanum, when working properly, is a really great game.  That's what makes it SO frustrating, the fact that hidden under all that bad programming a great concept is dying to come out.  I expect more from the guys that created the Fallout series which are some of the most entertaining games ever made.  The guys over at Troika should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this game as a finished product. Hopefully you won't experience as many showstopping bugs as I did, but be warned, they are out there.  If you don't believe me, just visit the official site boards and look for yourself.  Hopefully, Troika will make this game playable, and if they do I will gladly come back here and edit my review.	-1
Stuttering graphics, severe slowing during actions, cheesy graphics you'd expect from about 5 or 6 years ago......[PRICE]Not only that, multiplayer is practically nonexistant, the patches are extremely unreliable, game freezes AFTER the patches............ Take my advice.........stay away from this and all other Sierra Products.  Keep in mind, this is the same company that came out with the little gem Rage of Mages.............	-1
This game was not as good as everyone made it out to be.  After playing this one I did not get any others of the series.	-1
I don't see how anyone could possibly like this game. I couldn't get into it after several tries. The game play is the worst thing about it, the perspective is awful, movement sucks, one fight can last a very long time, even it's foundation is bad and even that is being generous. I see that many people like it, but the old infinity engine games are so much better in so many different ways. I don't even like them, but they hands down beat this game. It's a big step in a very bad direction for the series. It might have a lot of depth for all I know, but it's so terrible that I couldn't find out. Playing it was like being repeatedly stabbed with pins, it drags on and on. It's incredible how narrow, boring, slow, drab, and awful it is. The best things about it even make it worse. After playing Baldur's Gate 1 & 2, Icewind Dale 1 & 2, Dragonshard, and Demon Stone this is by very very far the worst of the bunch. I wish there was some redeeming quality to mention here. Usually I try to throw in some good point no matter how bad something is, but I really can't come up with anything at all. I've played video games my whole life and I would rather play pong than this waste of space.	-1
It's a shame.  Looks like this could be a good game but after installing the whole game, it just would not run on my computer.  After reading the reviews, I'm leary about installing patches - so I just uninstalled.  BioWare should never have released a game that works only on certain computers?	-1
Neverwinter Nights is really not a computer game in the traditional sense.  It's more of an electronic version of the pen and paper role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons.  If you are an avid D&D player who can't get your group together at your own house, you now have the internet to do it.  While this is fine for pen and paper D&D groupies, the rest of us are left out in the cold. Basically, Neverwinter Nights is set up in the hopes that a community will help it grow.  The game comes with a sample campaign to play but it also comes with a complete editor that lets anyone design their own D&D adventures.  Either with the official campaign included in box or some of the community made mods (there are already 500+ available online), you can play Neverwinter Nights by yourself or online with a group of players.  To further enhance the pen and paper D&D experience, there is even a dungeon master client in the game.  If you don't know what a dungeon master is I can already tell you you're purchasing the wrong game.  Basically, a DM watches over the mod and controls the adventure to hopefully provide a better game for the players.  Sort of like an invisible referee. This all sounds great when reading it on the back of the box but I'm not sure it really works.  For one thing, while the editor has a lot of capabilities, every map has that same square-look to it to fit in the D&D grid system.  Nothing looks natural and after playing a few mods you've seen everything the game has to offer and it all starts to repeat itself.  Also, for a game that relies on the community to invent new adventures, the editor is more difficult than it should be.  If you don't know programming basics, you're going to have a difficult time with the editor as every simple action has to be scripted which is basically simple C+ programming.  To accomodate this new system and catch up with its competitors, Neverwinter Nights also has a new 3-D system that reminds me of hack and slash games like Diablo more than the company's previous classic release Baldur's Gate I and II.  In fact, the official campaign included in the game is NOTHING compared to the Baldur's Gate games and I would recommend that you not buy this game if the official campaign is the only thing you will play.  The included campaign is boring, linear and not that creative, it's more of a sample for the editor rather than an epic adventure. If you plan on only playing online, be careful if you only have a 56K modem.  You'll never be able to host more than 3 players on your computer without lag.  Also, you'll have a difficult time joining the large servers with 20+ players if your connection is slow.  Neverwinter Nights comes with an ingame browser that divides online games by category.  You can join the action channel, the roleplaying channel, etc.  Most of these games are called persistent worlds and are basically smaller versions of Everquest. While they can be for awhile because of their small size and limited equipment, quests, etc., they never provide much fun.  The best way to play the game is to get together with a group of friends and meet on a weekly basis just like you would the pen and paper D&D.  While you can find people to play with through online fan sites, you'll have a much better time with this game if you already know people that own it and are willing to play the same mod with you at scheduled times. After trying this game for a month, frankly, I feel cheated.  I bought the game because it promised gamers that even if they didn't want to play online or use the editor they could play the official campaign included in the game by themselves and have just as much fun as they did with the company's other epic releases Baldur's Gate I and II.  That's a misleading claim because the new mechanics of Neverwinter Nights and the boring campaign included are pitiful attempts to live up to the company's previous PC D&D games.  This game is really only for people that want to enjoy an electronic pen and paper version of D&D, the rest of us should move on to Icewind Dale II or Morrowind or hope that another company manages to design a great singleplayer RPG as fantastic as the Baldur's Gate series.	-1
This game is an insult to the world of Dungeon and dragons Come on even Pool of Radiance is better than this. What the heck is this going back to the old format of dnd games Hello there, gamer want perspective like diablo2 Baldur's gate where you can see your charcter see in slash, cast a spell not a permenant camera following you has if you were in a maze. Extremely complicated for nothing thank good i have a geoforce2 asus 7700 powered by nvidia or else is it back to store for a refund or an exchange. I got nothing else to say that wasn't said from the other reviewers... Get Warcraft3 and Diablo2 or even Pool of Radiance, Icewindale... GhostRider666 the spirit of vengeance	-1
alright i thought. a true AD&D game from the company that created the classic baldur's gate series and other great games that ran well on my computer. unfortunately, this game barely runs on my mid-high range system. the game literally stutters along with constant 2-3 second pauses. i find that many of the other people in the bioware tech support problem were having the same issue without a response from bioware. after much research, i discovered there is only one solution to this problem and this consists of using a third-party graphics program (costs about 20 bucks to register). this program will not allow you to see any of the in-game movies and the performance is still slow, sluggish and just unplayable. to play this game, it comes down to either buying new hardware, waiting months for a patch that might not be released or just returning it. from what i've read on here and elsewhere, i see that this game isn't even worth playing even if it ran flawlessly on my system (to save space i won't repeat what others have said). my advice: get warcraft III. if you want a real authentic AD&D experience, play in real life for now as this game doesn't provide it even if it runs smoothly on your system.	-1
The game crashed my hard drive and forced me to BUY a new one. All of that happened after I unsuccessfully tried to install and run the game. I have a computer and engineering background, so this senario is not typical for me!  I know what I'm doing and if it takes too long or if it crashes, most likely, it's not my fault! The whole installation process was lagged (it would take several seconds for every move you'd make to respond) ... in the middle of the installation I was already frustrated but decided to finish it all the way, and then restart my system and see if it made any difference. Well, it didn't. I tried any display settings I could think of. I updated (or checked for updates) on all my drivers. I double checked anything I could possibly think of ... and at the end, the game ran slower than a snail ... and to add insult to the injury, the next thing I knew, the infamous blue-screen was there!!!  Last time I had a "blue microsoft screen" I was running windows NT, not XP!!  Need I say that I was never able to recover my computer, or the data on my harddrive? I had to buy a new hard drive as the old one had been damaged beyond repair and ended up losing lots of data. You've been warned! Buy and install at your own risk.	-1
I hope i'm not the only person out there who isn't tired of Lara.  It's not just the blatant pandering of her body, but the fact that the Tomb Raider games have been using the same graphics with minor tweaks for years now.  And still she sells.  I'm confused.  The only difference between the old Tomb Raider games and this one is that now this game is on the Dreamcast, so the graphics don't seem to be the same old thing over again.  But I'd say let's move on people.  They say Lara's dead in this game anyway, so let's let her die.	-1
Lacks the polish of its predecessors but a great game in its own right. I originally bought this because people told me it was the same as Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars for SNES. It is NOT ANYTHING like that, but it is another enjoyable series in which I look forward to the next incarnation.	-1
paper mario is very boring at the end of the game there is nothing else to do you can't get more exp points.this game has horrible graphics i don't give a damn if it's paper. there is really nothing to do at the end of the game.	-1
This is the WORST game I played. At first I thought this game would be excellent because I LOVED Super Mario for the SNES. When I put the game in, I wasted so much time on a LONG and boring intro that you HAVE to watch. 2nd Mario talks to EVREYBODY in the game, which adds to more boredom. May I also include there is no sound? 3rd, everytime Mario has a battle with a stupid bad guy, it goes into a scene similar to Pokemon. You do your attack, than Mario gets attacked himself! What is that?! If I made the game, I would just make it so Mario and him fought normally! 4th, the graphics are just terrible. 5th, the music REALLY got on my nerves. So ignore the majority of people that say it is the best.  In my opinion, the game is sad and just disgraces the N64.	-1
Koudelka was a game that I really wanted to love. I picked it up during my old game store raids as a kid, during the golden era of RPGs (1994-2001).  Koudelka sat shining on a shelf at my locally-owned video game store. As a unique blend of role playing elements set to a gothic timeline, I was immediately hooked. When I got home and popped the disc in, I was so ready to dive into this unique world.  Unfortunately, I never truly had the chance. The graphics were only decent for the time, with even lesser-known titles showing much more polish. The music was very disappointing, especially given Hiroki Kikuta's wonderful tunes in the Mana series. What really ruined the experience for me was the battle system. It was jagged, slow, and quite bland - the polar opposite of Sacnoth Games' intentions.  As a person who bought and beat almost all of the role-playing games of the PSX era, this one stands out as a true let-down. Out of my 21 RPGs for the original Playstation, this is the only one I did not beat. It stands among my otherwise proud collection, a sad sign of good intentions scarred by poor execution.	-1
If you have a four year old that has, for some reason, an affinity for prefab pop music, then this might be the game for you.  For the rest of us, this is a waste of money and time.  Wow, you get to choose the costumes and the hairstyles!  That is hardly what I call gameplay.  As for the gameplay itself --- if you know the difference between a triangle, circle, etc. then you are 90% percent of the way there.  Again, your preschool tots might find this a little daunting, but they will be the only ones.  One reviewer compared this to the old game SIMON, but that game emphasized good memory skills above everything else and is in fact still more challenging than this pre-fab nonsense.  Save your money and your time & avoid this boring, unchallenging garbage.	-1
American Idol could be the worst game of the year, just by the looks of it.. Look at how bad it is. The grapics are horrible. They are some of the worst graphics ever seen on Playstation 2. I saw some screen shots. There are many Dreamcast games that look better than this. I bet its boring too. I heard it took only ONE hour to beat. ONE hour. ONE HOUR!!! $50 for one hour! Are you people insane? Spending $50 for one hour of gameplay, probably with no replay value either. The show may be horrible, but I have a feeling this may be worse.	-1
For those of you who actually like Royal Rumble for the Dreamcast I must say that you are deprived! If you want the best wrestling game on the Dreamcast go track down "Fire Pro D Wrestling", an import game. This game has over 200 wrestlers and the most indepth create a player mode found in ANY wrestling game. Heck you can even edit the origional given wrestler costumes, wanna see Bret Hart in a blue jeans, then just edit one of his costumes. Wanna see the Rock in a shiny gold shirt and long black dress pants, then just edit one of his costume choices. You can edit costumes for everyone if you like, from Andre the Giant to Hulk Hogan to Dallas Page to Goldberg to Vader to Shawn Michaels to Chyna to Ric Flair to Y2J to Hawk and Animal and any of the japaneese wrestlers. EVERYTHING you want in a wrestling game is HERE!! It also supports 4 players and NEVER suffers from any slowdown. The cast of characters Fire Pro D range from stars from the WWF, WCW, UFC (yes Ultimate Fighter Championships) and numerous wrestling organisations in Japan. This game rocks! There are numerous game modes like Royal Rumble, Battle Royal, Survivor Series, 3 man tag, 4 man tag, 2 man tag, single match, cage match, barb wire match, submission matches and MORE. This has the MOST moves per character in ANY wrestling game. I dare any Smackdown fan to compare the two, they will loose BADLY!!! Overall the game is what a wrestling game on the Dreamcast should be and not the disappointing mess called Royal Rumble!! IMPORT THIS GAME, ITS A MUST HAVE!!!	-1
This game is garbage because of the few modes you can play and limited wrestlers. Sure it is good to get 9 wreslters into the ring at one time and it is kind of fun to fight in the parking lot near the street. But once you play it for a week or less, you get really tired of it. I suggest selling your Dreamcast and buying a PS2 or an XBOX which both have better (wrestling) games. Thats why dreamcast went broke. It had such good potential but the people did not put enough good games. Most were too much arcade like games that you got tired of. The rest was all sports. Well actually mostly all the games are better than dreamcast on the XBOX and PS2.	-1
lets just get this straight when i bought royal rumble i was looking for the next smackdown. One problem it nothing like smackdown first of all there are only 2 modes a regular one on one match or a royal rumble where there can be 9 people in the ring at one time. Yes i know the royal rumble match sounds cool but it is as boring as a one  on one match. In other words this game gets one star for being fun for 5 minutes.	-1
This has to be the worst WWF wrestling game i have ever played. Their are no create a wrestler options, no season modes, limited choices in wrestlers.control get screwed up at times. the game certainly does not take advantage of the Dream Cast hardware. I've played this game for about 30 minutes and simply became disgusted. Do yourself a favor and get something else	-1
Well it's safe to say that all the WWF games for the dreamcast.  Just keep on walking and get something else.	-1
I got this game from BlockBuster (I did not buy it) I was thinging o cool this is cool I got home played it.... THIS GAME WAS SO SO bad well not that bad but WM2000 and no mecry is 100% better then this. Its ture its ture. Thats all.	-1
I am serious. This game is the worst wrestling game ever made next to WCW Nitro for Playstation but it ranks up there with it. This game has two modes, no endings, 20 Characters, no entrances lame move sets and looks like a really nice textured Smackdown. I suggest u rent it for a night and when ure ready to throw it out the window return it. THQ failed at making a game and im appauled at the way this games average review is 4 stars. THIS GAME IS BAD! And this is coming from a gamer of 20 years....	-1
I love a good RPG.  Their is nothing like exploring a new world.  Taking on a new life.  In short getting away from yourself for a while. A good RPG will do that.  It's too bad nobody told the people at THQ about any of that. This game could be summed up in one word.  Boring. Nothing much happens.  When it does, you hardly notice. It's story does nothing to draw you in.  The graphics are ok at best.  Not the game to show off your PS2 that is for dang sure. Pop-in is horrible and I am surprised how Sony let this little gem slip by for the launch. Not really a game that shows off what the system can do. Some odd things make it into the game.  The people for one thing. They are in a word, ugly and so is the guy you control.  I am not sure what the artists were thinking but ... These are some ugly folk!  I am not saying they are not well done, they are.  The problem is that they actually look ugly.  Very odd choice.  The game play is so boring you may find that after about 20 min, you just don't care anymore.  The Quests are boring. The locations are boring.  Even the story is ho-hum. Nothing much is going on in this world. The music and voice acting are quite good but the game just never gets any momentum going. It feels lifeless and your role in that world seems aimless. A good RPG is a work of art.  A gentile balance of game and story line. If FinalFantsty and Zelda are like a Pollock or a Picasso then this game is paint by numbers portrait of a clown and some balloons.	-1
I don't mind the barely-better-than-ps1 look of the graphics.  The graphics were good enough.  I was getting into the story, combat was interesting, I liked the way characters leveled up, the side-quests were often amusing, looking forward to summoning all sorts of monsters until...  I couldn't even get past the first big city when one bug after another combined the make the game distasteful.  I'm sure it's possible to work around some of the bugs except, at MOST, this is just an average RPG and it's not worth trouble to fight the bugs when there are dozens to hundreds of playable RPGS that AREN'T so buggy.  I was impressed enough by what I did see in the game that I'm likely to give Summoner II a shot - very few bug complaints on that game.	-1
The graphics on this game were very disapointing and the gameplay is not too great either.  Only reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because there is a storyline, something many games are lacking now-a-days.  I would not have bought this game if I had taken a closer look at the graphics.	-1
This games graphics are awesome, but the one thing I hate about it is the way the dialogue is.  It is in light blue in a dark blue box, and I can't see it for the life of me!  I play in a bright room too!  I haven't gotten very far, but the game hasn't inspired me to do it.  A real disappointment.	-1
Upon starting Summoner for the PS2, I was immediately dismayed by the "Now Loading" screen thrust at me before anything even started. I waited for about ten seconds, only to learn that the loading was simply to throw a quick THQ logo onscreen. To add to that, the loading for actual in-game play is much longer. You can actually walk to the kitchen and grab a drink, come back, and still see the loading screen. As for the gameplay, the so-called "combo" system is simply engaging in combat, and pressing in one of four ways on the directional pad during combat. The combat is extremely stiff, and aside from random grunts and moans, nothing special. The overworld movement is not too bad, however, with the camera keeping up fairly well with the main character. Graphically, this game is a disaster. Choppy framerates, draw-in that is downright laughable, and a graininess that would of been criticized even on the PSOne. At one point, you enter a harbor area, and see the open skies ahead of you. However, as you step forward, you see a castle form not even 500 yards ahead of you, causing a friend of mine to joke that they had a cloaking device. In terms of sound, the music is quite nice, really. The failure comes through in the aforementioned combat. With that exception, I have no real gripes about the audio. The game itself would be very well had these flaws been dealt with. The storyline is intriguing, and the characters are fairly well designed. The quests are enough to keep you occupied for some time, and varied enough to avoid boring you. The dialogue is splendid as well. Overall, Summoner is a potentially good game gone horribly bad. Obviously rushed before the draw-in, combat, and graphic errors could be corrected, the mark was missed. Hopefully this will be a lesson learned for THQ.	-1
Hmm...I'll start with what's good: the game is fairly fun, it has a reasonably cool skill system, there's enough side-quests to keep you entertained much longer than the game actually takes to beat, the characters have some amount of depth (and differ rather greatly), the graphics are fairly nice, the music is quite good, the voice actors fit very well with their characters, it's the best rpg-ish game on the PS2 (which, honestly, isn't saying much at all), and, most importantly, it has a great hidden movie (press X in the credits). Now for the bad: there are enough random side quests to make the most hardened player of BG2 cry, and very few of them give you the option to not take them on. That means if you only want to do a few of them, you'll have to sort through the ones you don't want in your quest menu. Also the character AI is the worst I've seen since Warcraft 2. Characters will run off on their own to initiate a battle across the battle map, or will throw fireballs at enemies that are healed by fire while your other characters in the blast radius get hurt (after the same attack on the same enemy has failed to have a positive effect the last 20 times it's been tried). The sound cuts out all the time (probably one out of five areas/encounters has only the background music and footstep sounds) and I have yet to hear the sound from the Dragon summons. Probably the most frustrating thing is the messed up experience system. I won't go into great detail here, but after 20th level, you need 20 times as much experience per level, but still get it at the same rate....and you're getting fewer skill points. So why does this get such a low rating? The real reason is that while it's on the Playstation 2, it seems like it was given as much effort as the average Super Nintendo game....from graphics to sound to depth of game, it's an inferior game taking up the shelf space of a superior system.	-1
So, to most of the GR readers, I'm warning you to stay away. It's the video game equivalent of going to the library and reading a Golden Book instead of Tolstoy. But if you have a really young sibling or even a child of your own who definitely likes Pikachu and can bear all his long term annoyances, there might be a possible Christmas present there.	-1
I like Poke'mon, but do not buy this game! The peoffesor runs the whole thing, Pikachu never listens, there is a time limit (...).  Be smart, don't buy it!	-1
Alright, I may not be the biggest Pokemon fan there is, but I know a flop when I see one. I don't know about you, but I'm sick of seeing those little Japanese toys that you have to feed and take care of, and if you leave it for a second it dies. I suggest pulling out one of those old Tamagotchi's, it will save you some cash. Overall, I give Hey You! Pikachu 2 stars. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because even though this game is pointless, that Pikachu sure is cute! I would only recommend it to people who's kids are die-hard Pokemon fans.	-1
Don't let the cool box art fool you. This game is just the opposite of what the box art suggests. It suggests fun, great visuals, and a stellar, epic storyline. In (game) reality, the fun comes in very small, almost untraceable doses, the visuals offer a palette of dark colors that blend the setting with characters and items, and the storyline is neither epic nor stellar. If that doesn't chase you from the game, then the rest of this review most definitely will.  The Good: + The level-up system is actually rather good + The dialogue will make you laugh--whether it's meant to or not  The Bad: -- Somebody let this game out into the market -- Long sequences of boring combat -- Many people might not even find their way out of the first castle  The Ugly: :( The character and monster designs  Storyline--1/10  Unfortunately the script-writers don't provide the characters with any intelligent dialogue. In fact, it's laughable. The game doesn't take itself very seriously, which makes things even worse. Take for example what the main character, Alaron, says when the party stops to rest. They sit before a campfire and the camera zooms on Alaron's face. He says, "Ah! Pass the marshmallows." Not only is this not very funny, but it grows annoying when you have to watch this scene every time your party rests. The best line of dialogue, though, belongs to the knight, Abrecan. When the king sends Alaron on a quest and offers as a reward to make Alaron (who is at the time a squire) a knight, Abrecan objects. He continuously insults his king by saying, "You are too generous." And each time he repeats those words, more and more of them become capitalized, expressing Abrecan's abhorrent anger for the king allowing this young squire a chance to become a knight. Compared to that line of dialogue, nothing else is worth remembering.  Gameplay--1/10  Many of you may not find your way out of the labyrinthine castle you start out in, but for those who do you'll do some questing and searching through the not-so-labyrinthine-but-still-difficult-to-navigate outside areas. Most importantly, you'll be battling bad guys. That's what you bought the game for, right? To battle bad guys? For this, the game developers bumped their heads together and thought, "What is so fun about video games?" They made a list, narrowed it down to "What's so fun about RPGs," and then, for the fun of it, made a list of "What would not be fun in an RPG." But somebody accidentally slipped this last list to the developers and threw out the other one. Thus the combat that lasts 10 to 20 minutes and consists of lots swinging and missing. I swear, the chance to hit in this game is about as low as the chance to miss in other games. There are so many factors that go against your chance to hit that there just is no hitting. And when you reach a high enough level to actually start hitting the enemies, you move on to the next area where the enemies are stronger and, thus, harder to hit. ARGGHH!!! Back to square one.  On the bright side, the experience system is rather good. You can put points into different skills for each character, giving you a lot of freedom for customization. Too bad the rest of the game couldn't have been so fun and original.  Longevity--1/10  As I said, many of you will probably never leave the castle, where poor Alaron will breathe his last, but for those fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to make it out and go on your quest, there's a lengthy quest here. Much of it consists of long battles between incompetent fighters, and very little of it consists of an engaging story. In the end, it would be much more merciful to allow Alaron to live out the rest of his days lost in the castle.	-1
I liked the movie, so I got the game for Christmas.  The minute i started playing it, I was very disipointed.  The Graphics are ugly and way to polygonic.  The gameplay is plain, boring and pointless.  I though it was going to be like Tomb Raider or Indy Jones.  Instead, it's like Small Soldiers video game; your objective is to kill everything and everyone (what would "real" egyptologists think of this?). You run through the Egyptian temples like you're runing through a boot camp training gantulet.  When O'conell runs, he looks like he's running on hot colls.  The voices don't even sould like the real actor; O'conell sounds like a British trying to be a locked-jaw American.  ....	-1
I got this game hoping, with my writing skills, I could create a masterpiece of an RPG game. But I was wrong. At first I had fun with storyline, making dungeons, characters, and naming and making enemies, items, and all that. I titled it, chose the opening theme, and stuff. I test played it and found out how hard it was to make this game. A great game like Final Fantasy series, Xenogears, Chrono Cross or Breath of Fire series must take ages to make because this is the most time-consuming game I have ever played. The graphics are very NESish, and old, but I liked them at the beginning. Then I got very annoyed with them and how old they looked. It was like I was playing a classic Zelda game, or the great PS1 game Tales of Destiny. I quickly grew bored with this game. Check out some other reviews, one guy from Chicago tells all that I cannot type for my hands are very tired. I had fun at first but it all gradually fell down on me and I gave it up. The Anime Maker is very difficult to use and Scenario mode is even harder. A very very difficult game; you'll need a strategy guide for this but of course they don't make one. They include 2 instruction booklets in the CD case that are even difficult to understand. The magic system is horrible and it is all too confusing and hard. Do not buy this game thinking you'll make a masterpiece. I don't even know how some people do so.	-1
Didnt work	-1
You'll need a lot if your going to make a serious adventure.  You have a simpler concept to use, since it is mapped out for you in text windows.  The game itself is simple too annoying to play.  After seven hours, I completed one half-finished village.  Imagine how long for the whole game.  Plus you need to use the playstation controller to write out anything that your characters will say.  Scripted events are near impossible to make, bug testing is not fun, and you will start to go insane at the point of 20 hours. Whenever you hear someone say "I Could Make A Better Game Than That!" shove this game in their face.  It ought to put him (or her) in their place.  Only recommended for the extremely super patient.	-1
I installed the game but could not play it. It said I needed to register the game but there seem to be no way to register online, like the site was no more.	-1
IM sorry to say I have to give a bad rating because the game just would not play as if it were blank the company would do well to check the games before they sell them if I didn't test or check things before I work on my clients I would lose clients. Also I threw away the bag thinking there was no need for it so I couldn't return it and my kid was really upset. PLEASE test you Games before Selling Sheesh!	-1
Alot of people are going to say that two stars is unfair for a game that has such great graphics and playability...i understand where you're coming from if you think that, because this game looks great and is VERY fun. But it is way too graphically violent for me. I don't have anything against shooting games in general, I love Counter Strike and IGI, and Unreal Tournament was good back in the day, but Wolfenstein ups the ante way beyond simple kill and be killed gameplay, going to extremes like depictions of torture and mutilation. Even though i can spend hours shooting enemies in the head while playing Medal of Honor, and enjoy lopping off limbs in Rune, playing Castle Wolfenstein is, for me, completely demoralizing and dehumanzing. I don't play it because of that, and any game I won't play can't get better than two stars. By the way, this game is banned in Germany. But that might just be because of the anti-German sentiment as much as the violence.	-1
Maybe the game had too much hype, but after nearly completing the single player and playing the multi-player for several weeks, I am rather disappointed.  The single player missions for the most part are boring and repetitive.  I'm comparing it to Half-Life and it is nowhere even close to the quality of the single player.  What is really shocking are the graphic defects present in the game - guns appearing through walls, dead soldiers hovering a few feet above ground, some cheesy AI, but better than most.  The multiplayer is much more enjoyable, and uses many of the single player maps.  I'll be selling it and buying Medal of Honor when it comes out.	-1
After the greatly successful N64 game Mario Golf, Camalot Software decided to cook up a new sports title for the year. I had extremely high hopes for  Mario Tennis, but in the end it was very disapointing. It's too bad really,  because it had all the potential to be an amazing game, but fell flat on  its face. It took me a little over five hours to complete in its entirety,  so that will give you a clue to just how bad this game is.	-1
As an adult I find this game extremely boring.  Basically you are a little dragon and hop around to recover dragon eggs stolen by some evil beings.  Your primary weapons are your body and the fire coming out of your mouth.  The graphics is very simple (ok, maybe because I have a PS2 I keep forgetting this game was designed for PSX), and the controls (like most Sony games) are more complicated than necessary.  The gameplay is repetitive and very tedious.  And the characters, when they talk to you, talk in text, not voice.  Very lame. If you want to play this game, rent it, don't waste your money buying it.  It's pretty easy to finish all the levels in a day or two.	-1
This game WOULD have gotten a rating of four or five stars, if it weren't for a nasty little bug that keeps you from finishing this game.  You can see ... for all of the details on it.  But in short, if you enter a 'Speedway' round and don't finish it and get your egg, you never will.  The game has been fixed and a newer version is available, but if you have the broken version the only way to finish the game is to send your memory card to Sony.  Since Sony won't replace the defective version of the game, I rate this one ONE star and recommend Spyro fans avoid it.	-1
This game is too hard to conquer, because when you try to solve the puzzles with your quick wits, the opponent will keep attacking you, over and over.  It makes me both angry and sick, because you have no choice but to keep on dying!  If you want to play puzzle games, I recommend Arkanoid, Buster Bros. and Jack Brothers.  This game is not worth playing!	-1
I am a big fan of the simpsons,but I'm sorry to tell the world that if it weren't for the simpsons name and if a random hero were in it, nobody would ever buy it. THQ was thinking that if they were going to publish that game, the name would sell even if it's a ... game. Hell, the NES simpsons were better!	-1
The Simpsons Night of the living Tree House of Horror is a game that is fairly close to the Treehouse of Horror episods in a few levels. You start off as Bart, who is armed only with a sling shot. Then you are Maggie that is a fly. Those are the first and fun levels I have played out of the four I have played. Then you are Marge and that is when the game gets incredibly dificult. Matge has to defeat four bosses in that level and then one really hard boss at the end. When you die if you are not at the last boss you get to do the entire level over again.	-1
This game is absolutely insane. Nothing makes sense, nothing is funny, crude & rude stupid adult humor.  The plot? Nope! Doesnt exist, your a drunk squirrel trying to find hes way to a non existing home. Goes onto a adventure helping all sorts of creatures, living & non living objects he helps out everywhere he goes why collecting money. Why? Idk You don't need money  Characters: First lets talk about the villian, such a wimp crying over spilled milk and blames hes men.  Berri, conkers lover? Has no meaning Forgets who he is, blinded by a stupid hat Gets randomly kidnapped for no reason by some thugs from the stone area for thier (party) club.  A boss made of poo.... Yuck! Disgusting, just why  The stupid stone people that come in female genders. Its really disturbing.  Worms who won't even let you climb a simple mountain :/  References: Movie refereces are in this game & honestly it ruins it You got the matrix  Aliens, with the alien bursting out of the leopard king  Breaking the fourth wall.  This game is weird	-1
This game didn't sell well and it's worth that much?! Unbelievable! You can buy 2 or 3 3DS games for that kind of price. I would never spend more than 100 for that, out of the question.	-1
Rent the game before you buy it! I know most people find the game funny and fun, but in truth, it is actually very disturbing. To me, at least. And it is so sad to see a funny game have a sad ending.	-1
What a great concept they had. And what a shoddy pile of junk the resultant game turned out to be. Evil Dead: Hail to the King held my attention for precisely 10 minutes before the novelty wore off and I was left with nothing except a great sadness, knowing I had spent my hard-earned cash on one of the worst games ever to grace the Playstation. The game gets an F on all fronts. Its main drawing card was that it got Bruce Campbell involved to do voice work and help with concept, but the fact is, there isn't nearly enough variety in the wisecracks, comic situations and Ash's activities. There's nothing here that hasn't been done infinitely better in the Evil Dead movies. The computerized graphical representations of the Evil Dead characters are just pathetic (check out that pale graphic imitation of the title sequence of Army of Darkness). And though Bruce Campbell is still one of the most delightfully hammy comic presences out there, after about an hour of hearing him repeat the same half-dozen one-liners every half minute, you're bound to get bored. This would be okay if the game had been well designed in terms of action, aesthetics, and feel. Noooo. As with so many other games with a strong license/franchise behind it, Evil Dead: Hail to the King abuses this license, using it to attempt to cover up atrocious design. First, the control scheme. It's bad enough that this game features the single worst use of "camera angles" I've ever seen (move over, Fighting Force 2), but why, oh why would they force a first-person-view control scheme onto a third-person-perspective game? Imagine having to play Double Dragon using the controls for Medal of Honor, and you get the ludicrous nature of Evil Dead's controls. And oh yes, the camera angles -- what makes the designers think it's a good idea to fix the camera on top of a tree looking down on Ash when you're trying to fight the undead? And even while fighting, if you move past the edge of the screen, the action stops so that the game can load a new, closer "angle", which completely kills the flow of the action. Then again, there isn't much in the action anyway -- swing your chainsaw and hope for a hit, twist and turn and mash those buttons. And there are so many enemies, all of whom react in pretty much the same way, that it becomes excessive monotony before long. The fact that the enemies "respawn" simply adds to the boredom. The only plus? Some of the environments look tolerably like the movie. If only you weren't forced to look from those weird eyesores they call "camera angles". This is the worst case of game programmers trying to be filmmakers I've seen yet. All this adds up to an experience akin to waiting in a doctor's office for your turn with no magazines and the heat turned up to the max. I don't care when I kill an enemy, I don't care when I find a page out of the Necronomicon, and I don't care when I get slaughtered. The apathy this game gives me is even worse than an ultra-tough game that hangs me out to dry. Stick with the movies; one minute of Evil Dead 2 contains more action, fun and engagement than an hour spent with this sewer rat of a game.	-1
After playing the demo version of this game, I was sure the complete game would be a blast.  The demo offered clean graphics and quick gameplay,  though it was hampered by an incredibly simplistic story.  Still, it made  me want to play the game. After renting "Threads of Fate,"  though, I have to say that Square has let me down again.  Though this one's  not nearly as bad as some of their other bombs ("Legend of Mana"  and "SaGa Frontier"), "Threads of Fate" is still a far  cry from a good game. The major faults of "Threads of Fate"  include the boring dialogue, skimpy storyline, bad camera angles, and  awkward control.  To put it simply -- you have to get through a lot of  nonsense just to get to the gameplay, but even that isn't so hot. You'll  run into lots of annoying features in the battle mode, such as zoomed-in  shots that prevent you from navigating effectively and annoying jumps or  unclear exits. There is some fun, though -- the battles themselves aren't  too bad, though they end up as hack-and-slash fests more than anything  else.  Having two characters to play is one of the game's few saving  graces.  It's especially fun playing as Rue and changing into the enemies  you just killed. All in all, Square is starting to slip, in my opinion,  and games like this only prove my point.  "Threads of Fate" is  worth a rental, but don't expect anything grand. Graphics: A- Gameplay:  B- Music & Sound: C Overall: B-	-1
The only good things I can say about this game is the graphics are good and bruce campbell's voice acting is good but the gameplay sucks and the game is not fun at all when your chainsaw runs out of fuel in the game and the chainsaw is your most useful weapon in the whole entire game because your shotgun handgun and rifle are all pretty much useless the left handed weapons in Evil Dead A Fistful Of Boomstick like your 3 shotguns and your gatling guns you have and your laucher you have in that game are so much better and so much more useful than the 3 left handed weapons you have in Evil Dead Hail To The King this game sucks ass.	-1
How is it that a sucky game like this one retails at almost $100. I purchased this game after buying and playing Fistfull of Boomstick (which is awesome, along w/Regeneration) I was very disappointed. Wish I could sell it at a New price.	-1
I love the films, I think the game set up is great, familular and fun. I think the graphics are okay by PS standards, but...  The Control is AWFUL!!!  The came is set up like a keyboard game for PC, up, back and... spin??? Yes, left and right spin the Ash!!! You have to spin him, then press up for forward, spin, press up, spin, press up.  Walking left...? SPIN, PRESS UP!!!  Walking right...? SPIN, PRESS UP!!!  Want to fight???  Too bad, your behind a tree, a wall, a rock and can't see your self to... are you ready??? Spin, then press up...  Did they play it before they released it? I can't believe they did.  Love the movies, hate the game.  Buy Fistful of Boomstick! Still too hard a game, but it plays correctly and that matters alot.  Now, if they would just make a real game they might learn there's a real market out there.	-1
The first foray of the cult Evil Dead horror movie series into video games began here with Evil Dead: Hail to the King.  Using the Resident Evil formula of pre-rendered backgrounds with 3-D animated characters, Evil Dead suffers from poor polygon designs, clunky controls, and the same "find the key to open the door" type gameplay we've seen in games like the Resident Evil series and Alone in the Dark.  Evil Dead star Bruce Campbell lends his voice to Ash and breathes some life into this otherwise dismal game, but the terrible control layout and configuration really bring this game down.  The Dreamcast version was a bit better with improved graphic and sound quality, but all in all Evil Dead: Hail to the King is worth checking out for fans of the Evil Dead series or survival horror games only.	-1
If you want to see cute cartoon animals acting just like Beavis & ButtHead,then look no further than this disaster of a game. Once a lovable squirrel that fought acorns,poor Conker has been turned into a furry Beavis(or furry ButtHead)and generally staggers through the game,accomplishing absolutely NOTHING.And that's just how you feel when you try to play this piece of garbage-you'll constantly feel that you're not getting anywhere and that you're not accomplishing a single thing. In the game,all you do is get drunk,swear,stagger around,puke and have a hangover-all through the entire game. You'll start to feel like you're in the animal version of Beavis & ButtHead(remember how much Beavis & ButtHead love to swear,do drugs and get drunk?),and you'll start to wonder where the fun and enjoyment is. Unlike "Conker's Pocket Tales",there are no goals to accomplish,there is no plot,and there is absolutely NOTHING to do except swear,get drunk,puke and have a hangover. Despite how much people try to get you to believe that "Conker's Bad Fur Day" is the greatest game around,you'll learn the truth about this game:That it's just a big promotion for alcohol.  Do yourselvwes a favor and get "Conker's Pocket Tales" instead. If you want a REAL M-rated game,then get Grand Theft Auto.	-1
The story is something like this: after the Army Of Darkness movie, Ash gets a new girlfriend. But he has nightmares, and he decides to go back to the cabin (which was destructed in Evil Dead II), to end this once and for all. The cabin is well-clean and everything (where's the connection with Evil Dead II, partners?). But Ash's girlfriend is kidnapped by Bad Ash (more like Evil Dead II's then Army Of Darkness'). Your objective is to find six Necronomicon pages throughout the game, a boring task, I must say. And you also have to save your girlfriend. That's what you have to do... While you move on, you might notice that, if you're a hard fan like myself, the game is only fun while you're walking inside or around the cabin, those familiar scenaries. All the rest is boring... The graphics are OK for a PSOne game, for all I've played.. Trees move, the fog moves.. No big deal, but it's ok... The sound is good too, Bruce Campbell does great voice acting (as seen in other games too). But it's not fun. And that's a big problem. Deadites keep coming and coming, some enemies are really tough, and you don't feel like you've finnished a masterpiece when you beat this game... It was a try, but I wish THQ can learn from its mistakes to make a cool sequel. In the educational point the game is not approved.. It's Mature-classified, you see.. There is a little blood, violence.. But no big things, you can let your grown-up children play it... Unless you are a hard Evil Dead fan and you want to have one more item for your collection, don't buy this game. It's my opinion.	-1
Heads up...this is one of the best games I've played, but I've never finished a session (or three slopes in a row for that matter) without the game crashing. I own ten other PS2 titles, this is the only one that has issues, so I know it isn't the console. If you can run it without porblems, it's the greatest game out there. Sorry for the bad news, folks.	-1
My problem with Conker doesn't have as much to do with the idea so much as it does the follow-through. In all honesty, I was thrilled to hear the company had recognized their own flaws and were attempting to reconcile for them by releasing a shockingly robust title that seemed to spit in the face of everything they'd done since the debates caused by the home release of the original Mortal Kombat. However, I left my initial playing with the sense that the while idea itself was exactly what the company needed, the execution was more than a tad lacking. The story plays out like a theatrical feature, which is appropriate considering the number of situations the game eventually borrows from popular films. Glass of milk (or is it a white russian?) in hand and a scowl plastered upon his face, Conker is immediately reminiscent of the kind of anti-hero popularized by Bruce Willis in Die Hard or Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction. Surrounded by his supposed friends and acquaintances, this introductory scene was a great way to set the tone of the story and introduce a hardened, slightly older version of the title's namesake. The moment the king's flashback begins is when the player begins to take control of the action. There's a lot of Hollywood inspiration in Conker's tale. From the little nuances and cliches such as the opening scene, to borrowed scenes or tips of the hat to films like the location of the King's throne at the end of the game, to straightforward rip-offs of memorable scenes or films like the unquestionably Matrix bank heist, this cartridge is chock full of film-lore. And, to its credit, the vast majority of the game's quirks, nods and thefts are handled very well, with just enough originality and additional humor thrown in to make it work within the broad confines of its storyline. For the most part, the story is successful. Its film parodies are spot on, while its original threads tend to lag behind a bit and force a joke just for the sake of it. It feels like the game was rushed, and rather than waiting for the inspiration to create something undeniably funny, the writers instead went with whatever they came up with the fastest. In addition, there's little if any direction as to what you should be doing at any point in the story. Bad Fur Day is a big fan of putting you in the middle of an immense area with no visual clues as to where you should go from there, then erecting giant invisible walls out of thin air and hoping that their placement will corral you into the exact area in which you should be. Successful or not, this method is employed over and over and over again, from the game's start until its finish. While the storyline is competent for the most part, the actual control and gameplay itself is nearly unforgivable. Physically controlling Conker is a complete nightmare. Even the use of the N64's well-designed analog joystick can't save this horribly imprecise setup, as the squirrel will occasionally veer left or right without explanation or mosey over the edge of a cliff moments after you've told him to stop moving entirely. Conker does have a sort of double-jump feature, in that through the use of his tail he can hover in the air for a couple additional seconds. He can also perform a high jump and a long jump, by crouching or running for a few second before leaping, accordingly. Unfortunately, these high jump and long jump options only seem to work when they feel like it. I've been running for upwards of a full minute, jumped, and watched Conker perform a weak little sissy jump and fall to his doom. This game really feels like something that wasn't fully tested before its release, the controls reek of incompletion. Add onto that one of the most horrific cameras in the history of 3-D rendering, and you've already got a pissed off gamer. Seriously, you're given supposed control of these angles through the use of the C buttons (similar to the way the camera is maneuvered in The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time), but as soon as you find a vantage point you're comfortable with and release the C button, it just goes off on its own and returns to a completely unhelpful, useless view. This camera cannot pass through walls, so if your back is against one and you're trying to prepare for a complicated, lengthy, precise leap, you've got to do it blind. Better still, once you've made up your mind and attempted said jump, the camera will awkwardly spin as soon as it's got room to get behind you, effectively reversing your controls in mid-air and introducing a loss of direction to your life. The audio is one of the few undeniable triumphs of this one. The voice acting is tremendous, Conker's voice suits him perfectly and the actors themselves seem to be having a lot of fun with the material. The music is the usual fare for Rare platformers, light and bouncy, and serves as a constant joke considering the circumstances surrounding it. Little tidbits like the main character mumbling to himself and retching when he's drunk, or fighting back bile while rolling an enormous ball of poo really make a difference in the experience, and are things I wish more games took the time to incorporate. When push comes to shove, there's really only one thing you can create with the ingredients provided by Conker's Bad Fur Day, and that's disappointment. There's no question in my mind this game needed another couple months of production before it was ready to ship, and looking back it should be regarded as the poster boy for the N64's lifespan. This game wasn't created to entertain and enamor so much as it was to annoy, frustrate and defeat.	-1
No offense to old-school shooters or their fans, but this is a pretty weak excuse for a PS2 launch title.  Sony's "ultimate game machine" (or whatever tagline they're using) should be able to easily handle the first and second Gradius installments, along with these two, on a single disc.  Where are they?  I hate to say it but Konami isn't giving us a whole lot of bang for our buck (which is unusual for them). Sure, the new intro is nice, but what about the games themselves?  I think Father Time has a way of exaggerating our sense of nostalgia, especially where video games are concerned.  Some games simply do not age well.  In the battle between pretty graphics and solid gameplay, I stand firmly on the latter side, but next to the best shooters of the post 16-bit era (such as Einhander and G Darius), Gradius III and IV just aren't much fun.  The actual shooting is downplayed while too much emphasis is placed on memorizing the enemy patterns and maneuvering your ship so as to avoid becoming instant space junk.  Before too long, it ceases to be challenging and just gets annyoing.  Get killed and you lose all your power ups.  Good luck beating a boss with just a speed-up bonus.  Plus, there are no continues in Gradius III!  Instead, it uses a lame stage select mode. I know, these were landmark shooters in their heyday, but we should be playing more advanced games that learn and borrow from them, not just recycling them for a new system.  I fully support the continuation of 2-D gaming in the 3-D era, but this is not the way to go about doing it.  If you really want a traditional shooter for your PS2, try Silpheed: The Lost Planet instead.  Not as much of a challenge, perhaps, but MUCH more enjoyable.	-1
Is this game fun? Yes.  It is fun. But it is not 2001 fun. It is 1995 fun. Does this game belong on this platform? No. This is an embarassment for Sony to touting these incredible hardware specs and then have a game like this released on this platform. But that's what happens when third party developers start trying too hard to push games out the door. I'm waiting for metal gear solid 2. You should too.	-1
This game a foul - the long cut scenes are full of disgusting humor. Those were the best bits. The actual game iteself seemed like cruel and unusual punishment. The 'puzzles' wouldn't stump a four year old and the game play is tedious and repetitive. If I hadn't borrowed the game from a friend I would have put it down the garbage disposal by now. The game suffers from many of the problems that Nintendo games have. You have long and tedious jumping sequences in which the character will often fail to jump for no apparent reason causing you to have to repeat the sequence from the start over and over ad nauseam. The direction the character moves depends on the camera angle and, as the camera will swing around unpredictable, the character will suddenly start marching off in a totally different direction when you haven't moved the joystick. As much of this 'game' involves walking along narrow paths, this is a real pisser. I picked up the controller exactly three time with this game and each time I threw it down in disgust 30 minutes later. I guess I'm a slow learner. If they the game out and just left the cut scenes you'd have something I'd probably pay $5 for but at least I'd think I'd gotten value for my money. The game seems designed to irritate and annoy the player. Don't buy it unless you really enjoy repeating the same boring stuff over and over.	-1
Conker's Bad Fur Day may look like some cute Banjo Kazooie game, but guess what? It is far more complex than Banjo Kazooie. This little twerp pees on his enemies, swears, gets drunk, posses as an army guy, and does other stupid things. This is not a game for children to be playing. He even has sex with girls in some movies. Parents, don't even consider buying this for your five year old. Infact, not even when they're seventeen.	-1
Revising my previous review:  having tinkered with this game some more, the problems are even worse than I thought.  If I could give this game zero stars, I would, because it is absolutely unplayable in it's current form.  In spite of some interesting design elements, there are EXTREME problems with both programming and game balance. I honestly don't see how this game could have made it through alpha testing without someone catching these problems.  It is clear that nobody at the company ever played it all the way through. About half way through the game, you hit a pair of monsters called "Amazoni man traps".  I don't use the term "unkillable" lightly, but these things deserve it.  They have an ENORMOUS, rapid fire, area effect attack that paralyzes and poisons, and  always whipes out the entire party in the first volley!  I had to replay the battle five times just to last long enough in order to be able to turn around and see what was attacking me!  Their attack is so disproportionate to anything else in the game that it has to be a programming glitch.  I really can't believe that any playtester on the game made it past these things without using some sort of cheat code-- if they even tested this section of the game at all.  The Man Traps can't be bypassed, and even a party which has completed every quest possible by this point will be woefully inadequate to deal with them.  Basically, the game comes crashing to a halt at this point. Anyway, like I said, the game is unplayable in its current form.  I'm annoyed that Activision released it in this state, and I feel cheated at having spent money on it.	-1
This is a horrible game! It is really, really gory and nasty. The multiplayer mode is hard, and Rare really made a big mistake! If I could choose to buy either Yoshi's Story or BFD, I would choose YS, and I'm 19! Oh, Conker, what have they done to you!	-1
This game is so, so NASTY! Everything is sick and gory! A do not buy! I hate it! I hate it!	-1
If you cherish your sanity, steer clear of this thing. If you ever happen to run into it, stop, look the other way, and run. This has to be the worst game I've ever played and I've played quite a few. The graphics, the sound, the gameplay; it's all bad. After sitting through an hour of it, I asked my 10-year-old cousin what he thought of it and he said "Please turn it off." I concur.	-1
I am a 24 year old mom of two children; five and four year old.  This game might be fun if you like to walk in circles and doing things over and over again.  But it is very frustrating and hard to hardle specially for little ones.  I played it for hours but never got more than 4 goldens tickets, got 201 red tickets but what's the POINT! They are not worth anything.  My brother bought this game for his 7 year old daughter who kept calling me to help her play, because she kept saying "it's too hard".  Kids loose interest in extremely difficult games, since you can't get much proggress playing for hours and IT IS hard to get golden tickets!  And you can't do anything without them. About Graphics, I think they could have done a better job.  It's kinda fun with the character's comments but that's just it.  I wouldn't buy this game for my children.  Tiny minds, simple games; but this game is anything but simple.	-1
After playing games like Knockout Kings 2001, and Madden 2001 I start to question whether EA Sports developed this game or some newbies who threw stuff together.  First of all "real time" commentary, forget it.  The commentary in the game ....  When you go from track to track during the career mode you've got the same stupid commentator saying "So and so really moved in the point standing after last weeks race.", they say this EVERY time.  How hard is it to record a few different statements?  The graphics are okay and the physics engine is pretty good but not good enough to make up for the rest of the game.  They should have added more to the career mode, like getting offers from sponsers depending on how you're doing.  Hiring and firing crew chiefs and spending your earnings to keep you car running and to buy upgrades and stuff.  When the ... will game developers learn that they are leaving out most of the reality in these games?  Rent it, beat it, and buy something else. And one more thing, if you rent it DON'T turn on the rear view mirror or the whole game is as choppy as the ocean during a hurricane.	-1
Stay away from this game it is terrible. I liked NFL BLITZ a lot and thought that this may be a bit simmular. There are a lot of differences but the main one is that NFL BLITZ is good. With terrible sound play control and too little characters this game bites the big one. Do not even rent it.	-1
I really see no reason to buy this game, you can beat it within 45 minutes if you can even stand playing it that long. Its only remotely fun when you play in 2 player mode. The characters add some spark but not enough to save this horrrible game. If you lik boxing, you might like it, but thats abouy it. Youll get bored with this game very fast so i highly reccomend knockout kings instead of this. There are much better ps2 games out there, so get out out and explore, just esort to this as a rent.	-1
I'm very sorry but the game it's not worth the money.  The graphics are 'SMASH'.  In fact, the only good thing about it is the voices are from the t.v show.  Please don't spend $ on it.	-1
The only thing that makes this game the slightest bit challenging is the controls. They change on you once you let go of them becuase the camera shifts positions every 5-10 seconds. It's not really a mystery. You find objects lying around in the open flashing, you pick them up and just give them to Fred who is always 2 rooms away! The bad guy also happens to be extremely obvious becuase you aren't introdeuced to anyody except for one person. This game defies comics. You can become 2D or hide under leaves when the monster is right next to you, and then he'll go away. You lose courage easily but with scooy snacks always 10-15 footsteps away (Not to mention and easily accesible kitchen to give you full health) you can't lose. I know this game says "inteded for younger audiences" and I'm 13, but my 7 year old brother tottally agrees with me! Beleive me, scooby-doo fans will be dissapointed with this game. Controls are terrible, game is way to easy, not to mention scooby-doo always follows you around like Pikachu in Pokemon Yellow, execpy Scooby gets in your way! Once my brother had to reset the game because scooby had cornered him and made it impossible for him to move! Save your money, buy something else.	-1
Since this controller is made by Interact, the same company that makes the GameShark2, I thought this would be a great controller.  However, I should have spent a little more money and bought an actual Sony DualShock2 :-( The main problem is that this controller is really designed for someone with BIG hands, like some of the tallest NBA players.  I have fairly large hands myself, with long fingers from two decades of playing piano, yet it was still rather difficult to reach the shoulder buttons.  I cannot imagine some of my friends with REALLY tiny hands trying to use this controller when they come to visit!!!  This is certainly NOT a controller for children, as their hands are simply not large enough to adequately grip the controller. Also disheartening is the extreme tightness of the controller's buttons - including the directional keys (D-pad) - directly out of the box.  This controller features programmable button sensitivity, but even that did not fix the problem :-( In the end, this controller is really good for only one thing: a complete waste of money.	-1
First, there are similar games with better grahpics, like Myst.  Second, upon playing the game I felt a bit betrayed.  Nothing on the packaging indicates that this game has a specifically Christian outlook, but it becomes apparent upon play.  Had I know, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place.  Now that I have I suppose I'll have to sell it in an attemp to recoup something.  The designers, et al, should have had the integrity to be honest about the slant of the game BEFORE unsuspecting people buy it and discover it for themselves.  I've nothing against proselytization, but at least be up front about it so that I don't waste my time or money.	-1
After playing "The Longest Journey" (sigh-I loved it) I was getting edgy for something new.  I wanted to see if there were any games out there like it. "The Longest Journey" is still my favorite game and I wanted something similar or better (if possible).  I read all the reviews of THIS game.  Half of the reviews seemed favorable and the other half hated it.  What to do...I contacted, via email some of the reviewers to ask them if they think I would like the game.  Consensus showed I should get it. Okay so here goes.....The game began with little graphic and exciting scenes of what to expect and then BOOM! The actual game had horrible graphics. I mean real bad.  It's so pixilated you can barely make out the Sphinx itself.  I proceeded anyway because I was kind of feeling the Indiana Jones hype and went further..to the first and obvious puzzle.  It seemed hard at first but I "unlocked" the puzzle in 5 minutes! That's right! 5 minutes.  Okay, I gave it one more chance...I tried to find my way to the next step and the 180 degree turns and slow "Myst" click and move steps got me so annoyed and lost it took me an hour just to figure out where I needed to go.  I could never get to the spot I needed to, because apparently I needed to download a patch to proceed.  I found out after calling some game stores at the local mall that you need a few of these patches to improve the game.  It is playable without them, but extraordinarily difficult.  I really wanted this game to succeed. I had done my homework, giving it a fair chance and it failed.  It really was like an Egyptian "Myst" minus the beautiful graphics, intellectually challenging puzzles and lacking a great plot.  I am still remaining open to new ideas from anybody.  I have since, returned "The Riddle of the Sphinx" and am looking forward to suggestions from other game reviewers.  If anybody has ideas for me please feel free to email. Thank You.  And to those of you who were so kind and helpful...I'm truly glad you liked the game..I guess it just wasn't for me.	-1
I loved the movie, The Grinch, but this game is just bad. First of all, the graphics are very bad for Dreamcast. They look more like Playstation's graphics.  Second, It gets annoying. Every few steps, you will have to wait a minute while they recite a cute little DR. Seuss rhyme about the place. Third, the missions you have to do are very poorely explained. Fourth, one of the most annoying things were that every time you go near a kid in Whoville, he'll try to hug you and say,"Hi big daddy!" and you have to shake him loose. This happens a lot. I have to admit that they did do a good job on Whoville.	-1
This game won't install on my new AMD 3500+ cpu, it freezes during disc 2.  Purchase with extreme caution.	-1
I really hate to say that this game is thoroughly mediocre since it does have a few things going for it, such as the gorgeous graphics and somewhat interesting storyline.  However, I cannot recommend Mafia to anyone who has already played a truly great driving/gangster game such as Grand Theft Auto 3, or who doesn't like attempting a single mission 30+ times. Overall, the idea of letting you play a Mafia don in the 1930s is a good one; however, it's just poorly implemented in this game.  Gameplay: Your character is a taxi driver who is forced into a career of crime.  By completing missions (driving, killings, vandalism, more driving, etc.), you rise in the ranks of the Salieri crime family.  Much of the gameplay, from the controls (mouse, keyboard, and optionally a gamepad) to mission design, is easy to pick up and much like GTA3.  Nonetheless, the big problem with Mafia is that the gameplay is tedious and at some points down right boring.  While the city you do your dirt in is very beautifully rendered, it's rather dead and does not have the bustle and liveliness of GTA3's Liberty City or Vice City.  There's no reason to ever get out of your car as you are driving between missions, since there are no ammo shops to visit, mini-missions to unlock, or other things to do. You can literally spend 20 minutes driving from Salieri's bar to the next mission site, and there is absolutely no feeling of accomplishment once you finally arrive.  On the good side, the developers of the game have tried to make it realistic, which is both the strength but also many of the weaknesses of the game.  The cars look fantastic, though they handle poorly. Also, unlike GTA3, you can't commit outrageous traffic violations without drawing the police, and you can't just jump in and steal any parked car.  The animation of the character models look realistic and scenary feels authentic.  Also, though it has the automatic save system that GTA3 has, Mafia saves the game at more points, so that you don't have to do too much backtracking if (I mean when) you fail a mission.  Now, for the bad side. The cars are just a chore to drive. Bad handling, low horsepower, slippery tires, you name it. And given that there is so much driving required by the game, the developers should have allowed you to skip some of the non-eventful driving scenes. To make matters worse, many of the missions are timed and the in-game map is useless.  You'll lose a number of missions just searching for the bridges that connect the city together (no roads or bridges appear on the in-game map). It is hard to imagine why the developers of this game thought that beginning and ending missions with such annoyingly long and tedious driving sequences would be fun to players.  And now, for the ugly. Yes, the racing mission (#6) is as awful as many people have said. Even though I have the patched version of the game that includes a difficulty slider for the race, it was still too hard on the "very easy" setting. The race is way too long, the track has way too many sharp turns, the race car is way to prone to spin-outs and roll-overs, and the controls (gamepad or keyboard) just don't cut it for what is required.  I tried this mission over 30 times and never won the race and thus never finished the game (which is rare for me).  The race was the worst instance of the frustrations of gameplay, but there were plenty more.  Graphics: The real shame is that Mafia, as tedious and poorly designed as it is, is a beautiful game. The cutscenes, though a bit too long sometimes, are well done and even the lip-syncing is better than most games I've played. The cars are shiny and sleek and show damage when they are abused. The city itself is well rendered and driving in the countryside is just heavenly.  It's just too bad that some of the energy that was expended on creating such realistic graphics was not used to make a truly exciting game.  Sound: Everything is cool in this department.  The voice acting is well done; cars, weapons, and other things sound as they should; and the music is fine.  Replay/value: Since I only paid $10 for this game, it's hard to feel cheated, even though I was able to complete only 5 of the 20 missions.  My disappointment is largely about what this game could have been with just a bit more effort and testing.  If you are a very patient player and don't mind long stretches of repetitive gameplay (such as all of the dull driving that you'll be doing) and can find a way to beat the racing mission, then this might be worth your while.  However, if you are expecting a game with a lot of exciting car action, very original missions, and anything approaching GTA3's funny, openended mayhem, definitely look elsewhere.	-1
Don't get me wrong.  This game is fun, however, the frustration factor is about to make me go on my own killing spree. First of all, there's no in-game save.  The game saves after every level so if you screw up you have to start over and over and over and over...  The vehicles are fun to drive, however, the control is difficult.  I seem to slide on invisible patches of ice.  Why is it that when I'm chasing someone, no matter how fast my vehicle is, they get away? and why is it that when I'm being pursued, no matter how fast my vehicle is, they're always riding my tail?  I found the race to be most challenging and you'll use a few colorful words before you win.  I would have won sooner, but again, al I did was skid at after turn and spin out to end up facing the wrong direction.  The story-line is entertaining but the game is just too frustrating for me to just sit here and play the same level over and over and over and over.  Two hours of the same level is not worth my time.  I have a life.	-1
A note to game developers everywhere.  It's possible to create a challenging game that does not involve intensely annoying obstacles.  Rule #1:  all games should have a quick save option at any point in the game.  No one enjoys going over the same mission over and over to get it right.  Mafia only saves at the end of a mission or important task--or not nearly enough!  This alone makes me want to pitch the whole mess.  Rule #2:  excessive amounts of driving around and map reading with old jalopy cars with extremely poor handling and dealing with other stupid drivers on the road is no fun attall!  Way too much driving required.  I drive enough to and from work 5x a week and deal with inconsiderate idiots on the road daily.  I don't need it in a game I want to be a diversion from the grind of daily life. If there were workable cheats available for this game it might be bearable.  I would like to finish it, but only with access to cheats that actually work.  I play games for enjoyment, not torture.  I've searched the internet several times for cheats, and none of them work as described.  A real disappointing game that didn't have to be.	-1
Pretty much everything has already been said and I think it just depends on the person, but I got bored with this game...so bored that when I upgraded my system and the game stopped working with the new configuration, I didn't really care even though I was only a fourth of the way finished.  So, if I have anything to say about this, I'll speak to that problem. Without getting into specifics, basically when I upgraded my system from mid-level to high-end, the game stopped working. It will load and begin, but then it just completely quit. I lowered the clock speed on my processor and selected the lowest graphics settings: that got the game to work for about 30 minutes before it just crashed again. That was also after I installed the patch. None of this makes any sense to me and I fix and build computers for a living. At that point, I was only playing because I'd spent good money on this game and was hoping there was going to be something other than pretty graphics and a good story to make it worth while. It takes up too much space on the hard drive (IMHO) and the game play is seriously lacking. There's no incentive to explore-it's entirely too linear. Perhaps if I had a chance to really get into the Free Ride part I'd like it, but since you have to play the regular part of the game before all of the Free Ride is unlocked...and since the bloody game won't hardly work anymore (even though all of my soft and hardware is `supported') I guess I will never know. I'm not at the point of asking for my money back, but close. I'm very disappointed and I really wanted to like this game. I tried to like it. I like driving games and I like mafia and old `Chicago' type of stories. I did not like this game, though...even when it was working. Download the demo before you buy. If you do buy, download the patch because you'll be glad you did when you get to the race. It's absurdly difficult without intermediate saves.	-1
I was thoroughly disappointed in Mafia. I hate to say this, because I really wanted to like this game, and for the first hour or so I really did. But as the game progressed so did my frustration. It's true that Mafia has it all - wonderful graphics, engaging story, interesting missions, action, even music. But there are a few pitfalls that turn it from a great game into a so-so game. First, even though I did not really mind all the driving, most of it bears absolutely no purpose. The racing mission was absurd. If I wanted to race sports cars I would've bought a racing game. C'mon, people, NOBODY liked that mission! What was the point of it? But I stuck with it, forgiving them for the obviously annoying and pointless part, yet it never really got better. If anything, it got worse. While I can see they've tried to make many aspects of the game ultra-realistic, it's really anything but. Here are some points about that: Point 1: I understand that the vigilant cops and traffic violations were put into the game to make it seem more realistic. But how come that running people over or bumping into other cars leaves the cops indifferent? Point 2: The police cars are the fastest cars in the game. No matter what car you're driving, even a race car, they WILL catch up to you and arrest you. Yet when later in the game you get to drive a police car, the other police cars are STILL faster than you. Makes any sense? To me neither. Point 3. The game is happening in the 1930s. How in the world would a cop measure your speed? How could a cop walking on the sidewalk know what the speed of your car is? Yet they all stop you, cops in cars AND cops on the sidewalk. Point 4. The cops only seem to be after YOU. Whenever you have to chase after someone in your car, of course you have to speed if you want to catch up with them. Yet if you do the cops will run you off the road and arrest you for speeding. Never the other guy. Same goes for the "hide weapon" feature. If the cops spot you carrying a gun they will arrest you, yet there is one mission where you start with the gun in your hand. The sequence loads, you don't even have a chance to hide your weapon, and immediately the cops spot you. Forget trying to get away. The only way to finish either mission is to pray there are no cops around when the mission starts. Point 5: If you reload while your gun still has bullets in it, you lose those bullets. Only a fool would discard their half-used magazine in real life. In fact, in the military they encourage you to reload as often as possible, because this way there's less chance to run into an empty magazine. Another thing that might not be a problem for other games but is a huge one for Mafia is that it's a very linear game. It gives you very little room for creativity. In one of the first missions you have to collect money from a gas station and then carchase and kill the guy that stole the money. Before going into the gas station I shot the tires on the car, just in case. But when the very nest sequence loaded the car was driving just fine. The game consistently points you in the right direction, and there are no rewards for exploring on your own or deviating from the main plotline (unlike in games like Morrowind, in which you can progress any which way you want). And of course, the most frustrating aspect of the game is your inability to save games. Honestly, I can't comprehend why game developers do that. Is it so difficult to put in a savegame feature? Mafia is not simply a game where you cannot save, it's an _extremely difficult_ game where you can't save. Who wants to spend two hours going through the same mission over and over again? Did I mention that the conversations written into the missions repeat as well, and that you cannot skip them? After spending 2,5 hours on one of such missions only to get killed in the last two minutes of it and have to start all over again, I finally gave up. Sure I want a game that's challenge (I play all my games on "hard" or "realistic" difficulty setting), but I don't want a game that's a total frustration roller-coaster. Mafia could have been a real gem. It could have easily been an epic classic of the gaming world if it wasn't for the aforementioned downsides.	-1
I love the game when I get to the snowboarding parts, but its way too much work getting to ride. The graphics are really sweet. I love the way snow gets kicked up into the camera when you land, but I don't know if I can get over the glaringly annoying features of this game:  1) I feel like I am playing one of those Barbie dress-up games when I get to buy coats, pants, and goggles, give me a break. New equipment such as boards and bindings make sense, but jackets?!?! 2) Too much menu wrangling to get to the actual game play. If I lose a competition, there is no retry button. You have to go back to the lodge and walk over to the cheesy box head guy and enter all over again. Then at the end of the run you have to choose between replay and proceed, with the default always being proceed. Its just a major hassle. They should learn from Tony Hawk. They have it down. 3) Too much loading, especially in multiplayer session stuff. Nobody likes spending more time loading than playing. 4) Not enough thought put into the session competitions. For instance, there is one race with rails and windy, narrow lanes that have huge drop-offs on either side, if you fall off either side, you lose. It ends rather abrubtly this way, right before either player can get into it. Why not just send the rider back to the beginning of the course?	-1
just like my title states i may never even get to play this one, way to many controls for this budget shooter horribly set up its quite boring so far and i may never go back to it don't pay more than 3-4 bucks and don't buy it unless you are extremly patient	-1
I've got a brand new Nvidia 5200 128 MB graphics card, and just got back into computer gaming, so I was eager to try this game because it's a genre I love. Plus, my PC played COD and Battlefield 1942 so there shouldn't have been technical problems to play it. Boy was I wrong to think that. This game is a technical disaster. I ran it on a P4 with 256 MB RAM and it still crashed on me three times, something that never happened even once with other games at all. After it crashed for the third time BEFORE I even got to start the first mission, I gave up. The developers really dropped the ball on this game. From its looks and screen shots I've seen, it looks like a great game. But if it's too unstable to play, nobody's going to notice it. This game is an absolute disaster from a technical standpoint and the developers should be ashamed of themselves.	-1
This cable hardly has any improvement over the Sony cable that comes with the PSX and the PS2. If not demagnatized it creates crazy interferance and sends things that look like vertical damper wires all over the screen.  You're much better off with a Sony S-Video cable, a Monster Gamelink S-Video cable, or Interact's higher quality cable.  I personally suggest Interacts better one because it offers better quality at a lower cost than Monsters.  The cables themselves are thin and badly shielded, thus the audio performance is also sub par.  The only advantage is the ability to un-join the cables, so you can send the audio to your stereo, and the video to your TV.  But you can do that with Interacts better cable, you can't with monster's.	-1
I bought this "Brand new" and the yellow cable had black smudge marks all over it. The pin connector that plugs into the ps2 was damaged and loose. I had with it red white yellow AND an S video cable instead of red white and s video. I tried everything possible to get it to work and nothing, no picture showed up or sound when turned to the right channel mode and the cables matching where it should go. The black cable also has a small cut in the black cable but it didn't go all the way through. I will be returning this once i get paid and buying something else. I heard ps3 s video cables work with the ps2 and it is a sony product so I will try that.	-1
The s-video connector is faulty. It only works as a composite cable. I wish I had tried it sooner as I would have returned it.	-1
I have bought and played all the Monkey Island games before this, so I was excited to buy the newest fourth edition in the series. To my great disappointment though, they have changed too much. The graphics were great, but did they really need to make it in 3D format. Maybe I got a bugged disk but when I would use the pg Up buttom (or down) it wouldn't highlight the sentence I wanted to pick. Also, since you are not able to use a mouse, it takes him FOREVER to get anywhere. You need to walk in just the right space to get sentences to choose from...the list goes on and on. I am taking this back to the computer store tomorrow. Why couldn't they just make it mouse compatible. I would of really enjoyed the game!	-1
The Grinch is back in full force and it looks like Konami has tried to capture his essence in this poorly made game. Konami has made some dynamite games (Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Metal Gear Solid to name a few), so it comes as a shock that they've let this thing slip out the door. It's sad that many unsuspecting and well-intentioned parents will pick this one up thinking that their child will enjoy it. This game is horrible, pure and simple. Every level consists of the same challenges so boredom sets in fast. The graphics go from awful to horrendous, and back to awful if you're lucky. The pop-up is here and it's in charge. For instance, in the first level I played, the Grinch was on a ledge that completely disappeared when I moved him slightly. And on many occasions, the insides of buildings would stick out through the roofs and walls, making for a very unattractive gaming experience. I hope I've made it clear that the Grinch is a gift no man, woman or child, should receive.	-1
This game is soooo fun, but sooooo many bugs.  You think thats nothing?  Trust me, what a pain in the bum.  Glitches, stalls, ugh.  I have two copies for playstation and both have the same problems.  YET, if you buy it knowing and expecting bugs, or if it's ever re-released without them, this could be your favorite game ever.  Puzzle action without being lame...so grinchy.	-1
I played this game last Xmas, and within about 10 minutes I wanted to put it back in the box and throw it up the chimney.  Maybe I was just missing something, or maybe this game is absolutely horrible.  Someone else on here said they couldn't figure out the 1st world; I'm with you...I don't get this game.	-1
Personally, I feel ripped off for having wasted money on this product.  Like Call to Power 1, the game has some interesting features, particularly the variety of stealth units.  However, the game suffers from a number of MAJOR PROBLEMS.  Not only does it appear that the designers never playtested this game, it's clear that they never went back and played the first Call to Power either; many glaring problems from the original are still here.  The worst problems: 1.  WAY TOO MANY BUGS:  The game crashes often.  Also, there's a problem with save game files being corrupted that gets progressively worse as the game progresses.  -- I finally gave up after a game that I had spent 25 hours on would not reload, even though I had EIGHT seperate save game files from the last EIGHT turns.  Every single one of them was corrupted. There are also numerous less catastrophic, but more consistent flaws in the programming. For example, stealth units are supposed to be clandestined.  When you are attacked by one, you don't know who sent it.  The computer players, however, always do, and immediately declare war in response to any stealth attack by you. 2. BADLY WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION:  Quite frankly, this is the worst rulebook I have ever seen.  It's long winded and repetitive, yet still lacks many key pieces of information.  As a result, you have to use trial and error to figure out how much of the game works.  One example:  the rules mention that you must have military units on hand to control your slaves, but never spells out how many.  The right ratio turns out to be 1:3, but you wouldn't know that unless your read the rules to Call to Power #1. 3. WHOLE PARTS OF THE GAME DESIGN JUST DON'T WORK:  While the stealth units are interesting, some of them are so badly designed that they just don't work.  The Cleric, for example, is the chief weapon of the Theocracy, which uses it to go out and convert enemy cities to your faith.  This is an expensive and risky operation.  However, it is so ridiculously easy to undo this conversion (station a military unit in the city, endure one turn of mildly elevated unhapiness among the citizens) that no player (computer or human) ever allows a city to remain converted for more than one turn.  So why bother having the cleric unit in the game in the first place?  There are similar extreme problems with other parts of the game, many of them left over from Call to Power 1.  Do these people ever playtest their own products? 4. CLUNKY INTERFACE:  The interface is badly designed.  Information that could easily be put on one screen gets spread out over two or three.  For example, information on trade routes that you currently have and those that are still available are placed on different screens.  So to compare them and figure out if you have the optimal set of routes requires endlessly flipping back and forth between two screens. Overall, I just don't see how the designers could have played this game and still released it in the pathetic state that they did.  This is the second game that I've bought from Activision which was released in an unplayable condition.  Personally, I'm swearing off their products in the future. Those interested in a good Civilization type game should probably try Civilization 2, or better still, Alpha Centauri.	-1
Contrary to popular belief, this title is not part of the Civilization series. This is Activision's attempt at a Civ clone. In some areas it succeeds, but in most it fails. This game had no affiliation with Sid Meier, creator of CivI and II (the latter arguably the best pc strategy game ever). Pros: Good government selection. Some new governments are included, like Fascism, Technocracy, Theocracy, Ecology, Corporate Republic, etc. Armies and Fleets. In CivII a stack of units could be killed in what attack. This is not so. Automated Improvements. The government automatically does terrain improvements. Diplomacy and Trade: Both are well planned and fairly extensive. Cons: Diplomacy and Trade: Neither are used to their full extent, and if you try, other civilizations refuse. There's all types of stuff, like trade embargoes, etc, but the AI never does them. Civilizations: Over 30 Civs to choose from, but there's really no difference in between them. Also, whenever I play, I'm always up against the same Civs: French, British, German, Irish, Scottish, American, and Native Americans. That gets boring very fast. Slow: The interface is slow, even on a 128MB Ram P3 500mhz machine. Scenarios: Only 4 of them, and none are any good. NO CUSTOMIZATION OF UNITS OR CIVS: In Civ2 anyone could make their own units, terrains, technologies, scenarios, maps, etc. You can't do any of this in CTP2. Conclusion: Civ3 should be out in the US within 2 months, it's coming to Mac, and to Europe. Civ3 has Sid Meier working on it. Civ3 has elaborate diplomacy and trade. Civ3 has culture points, great military leaders, many unit animations, civ specific units, new paths to victory, total customization of units, civs, techs, maps, etc, has better graphics, more realistic, more units, will ship with 12 scenarios, and so much more. The bottom line: save your cash for Civ3, it's just months away.	-1
Trying as hard as it can this game lurches, lunges and sprints to a finish with a gold medal in crappyness. This "Olympics" simulation offers people the chance to compete in some true tests of player patience. At it's core this game is nothing more than Hyper Olympics.  Why they chose to dump this game on the PS2 is beyond me.  The game play is puzzling at best.  Logic has no place in this game and it makes that ... clear early on. I made the grave error of inviting some friends over to play.  We would relive our days in the arcade playing Hyper Olympics.  Needless to say all we did was boggle at how such a game could have been made. I can not go into how the controls worked because I am STILL not sure!  The on screen explanations are sad and are nothing more than clues tossed to the players. It's pretty clear that part of the challenge of this game is how to actually play it. Exasperation sets in very early.  In record time in fact as this game has THE worse music my poor ears have ever come across.  I am sure we would all agree that the sprit of the Olympics is best summed up in some very bad heavy rock music. Right?? If you own a Sega and would like to point at a PS2 and say "The PS2 [stinks]!" this is the game to have running on it when you point.	-1
All of the Street Fighter EX games (the ones in 3D) have been pretty bad. This one is no different. While it easily has the best graphics in the series, it should still look better for a 128-bit game. Capcom should have tweaked the controls, but it's obvious they rushed this one. Try Tekken Tag Tournament.	-1
I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just never impressed with the Street Fighter series when it becomes a 3D game. The graphics look terrible. It looks like a 3 year old drew up stick figures and smeered poo on them and said, "look Mommy, it's Blanca!" Really please, you can't tell me that you're impressed with the same predictable and boring fights with this game? Honestly, Street Fighter was a game that should have never gone 3D because it just doesn't work for the game because even so, you don't even have that because all you do is go back and forth. You can't get stuck in a corner but you also can't side step like Tekken. If PS2 really wanted to impress people, releasing Street Fighter Alpha 3 would have been the smarter move. I have to say, I'm really hoping that another one of these is not in the making.	-1
Street Fighter, always one of my favorite fighting games, and one of the few 2d fighters left, and that was ok because it was Street Fighter! But for some sick reason they decided to move it from lovingly done cartoonish 2d fighters to sub-tekken 3d. Why??? If you want a 3d fighter, get Tekken Tag. If you want 2d beauty like good-old Street Fighters of the past, sorry.	-1
what happens when you take a successful arcade game and translate it to a console? success right? WRONG- in this case that is. This game was great in the arcade due to the inovative use of a rifle and scope. But when you take that away all you have is a very bad "Area 51"-esque game. This game should have never been translated to ANY console and you will notice this quickly after playing for a minute or two. The controls are sluggish and just like any other shooting game that doesn't have a gun peripherial, it gets boring FAST. Only get this game if it is the only game you can find when you are buying a PS2.	-1
Like many others here I fell victim to a defective cable upon arrival.  It was missing more than half of the copper connections inside the cable, and the RCA plugs themselves are extremely flimsy and cheaply-made.  I contacted Amazon and got a refund and they told me to just pitch the cable, obviously I'm not the only one having this problem.  I'm not sure how this item receives a 4-star rating when it has over 25% negative reviews.	-1
These cables didn't work for me at all. Not sure if I got a bad batch or what the deal was but they just didn't work for my ps2.	-1
I'll expected more, but your playable and your graphics are no good. The history yes, is very good, but no the another things from this game.	-1
the only reason im going to give it 2 instead of one is bc of the quality of graphics but the game playing sucks .. i don't know wat is lamer walking around repetively hacking slashing the same creatures over again or the  bosses who are just overgrown blowhards who take a couple of shots u need no real stradegy to beat them ...also, i don't dig the storyline or want a storyline ... i mean ur a japense ninja equiped with japense fine steel u would expect a great fighting game not some cinematic movie clips	-1
Good: You get a free case for the CD?  Bad. No jump button. Linear game play (You use a button to access doors and stairs, what is this 1985?) Clunky controls. Its like driving an RC car where you have to mentally reverse your thinking when the car is coming toward you versus going away. This is totally lame and makes the game practically unplayable. Did I mention no jump button?  I paid $5 and would have had more fun had I kept the money and A) made a paper airplane with it or B) set it on fire and watched the delightful glow.  Buy Devil May Cry 3 and have a blast. Avoid this one	-1
This game has frustrating puzzles, and the gameplay is exactly like Devil May Cry, it's not funny. The story is so cliched, too. SAVE THE PRINCESS! Also, it's not realistic. The 1st boss is so stupid, a 3-year old could've made him. Only good thing is the graphics, but that's it.	-1
This game looked enticing...but I didn't realize from the cover that this is just a souped-up resident evil clone.  Granted that the graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is pretty fast, but there's not much to the game beyond that. Go to the next area, kill the monsters there (without the Resident Evil save-your-ammo-like-your-life-depends-on-it stratedgy which made Res Evil games so edgy), get the item, solve the obligatory puzzle, repeat.  The 'horror' aspect of Resident Evil games is completely gone which makes this one a bit heavy on the cheesy and not-so-challenging side. It's also REAL short. Good graphics, not so go voice overs, not too compelling storyline (save the princess...groan!). I was disappointed, but I guess I might be in the minority.	-1
I broke it lol. It's not entirely the cables fault since it got stuck between my desks and I tried to yank it out but it didn't resist much at all. The way the yellow plug pulled from the jacket just sucked. I didn't pull that hard. Had to buy another one. These plugs always feel kind of cheap, this is the second one I've broken by accident. I have 5 consoles and this is only an issue with Sony Playstaion gear. One cracked in half and I couldn't snap it back together, then this one came loose from the joint. Didn't feel like soldering it. Buying one from an aftermarket supplier.	-1
when you start playing you start yawning. The problem with games with pre-rendered backgrounds is that it completely ruins the pacing of an action game. If you look at any action film these days the camera and the elements being filmed all move. This kind of cinematorgraphy goes back to the days of film before D. W. Griffith. Ie set the camera down and let the actor run around until he leaves the room. Then set the camera down in a new location and repeat. If you like games like Resident Evil or Fear Effect this game is for you. Also if you like solving awkward puzzles, this game is for you. Any time one has to put an awkward puzzle into a game to mix up the game play means that one is totally out of ideas for the game. Like still cameras, awkward puzzles break the pacing of the game.	-1
Well, it was cheap. The cables are super thin. Think cheap headphone cable. The sound cables worked fine, but the video output has continual static snow that drives over the screen in waves. Other than that it works.	-1
Extremely cheap AV cord here. It worked to replace our totally broken cord, but it got damaged quickly. One of the sides of the part you insert into the Playstation cracked and bent, making the device very loose in the console. The other side quickly followed, and soon after, the sides of the plastic insert just broke off. This caused the device to fall out when the console was moved even a little. It also resulted in only one speaker side working because the device no longer fit into the console and it messed up the sound. We ended up having to prop up the device by inserting a video game case under it.	-1
Dont waist to money it's freaking crappie	-1
I bought the rfu adapter so i could hook up my ps2 in my room. I got it all hooked up and poped in a dvd i had rented and when it came on i was shocked. It looked like it was night time and it was acutaly light out. Also the sound is mono, so it only comes out one speaker. After this i bought a new tv(i needed one anyways) and the s video cable. The s video cable is awsome. Anyways, i highly recomend that you try to find an alternative to the rfu adapter if you want to watch movies. The game picture isn't to bad, but is not even close to s video or even the adapter the ps2 came with.	-1
My intention with this review is to provide a rather different oppinion from most reviews here which qualify this game with an average 4.5 stars.  I purchased this game for my son for two reasons:  The price drop and the excellente reviews.  I had no previous knowledge of Rayman, so I came unbiased to play it. I own 3 titles from Spyro the Dragon (games that have always satisfied my son) Jak and Daxter (PS2) and Crash Bandicoot "Wrath of Cortex" (Xbox), and my son plays all of them very regularly.  I personally like these games very much so I expected Rayman 2 to be a great platformer game.  Well, the thing is that my son played Rayman 2 for about an hour and a half and never picked it up again, I myself had to play it in order to understand what was wrong, but then I understood him. First: the graphics, I have read in every review, even the newer ones, that the graphics are excellent and so on.  Well, to my opinion the graphics can not even match Spyro 3 on the PSOne, they are graphics that are ok for an early launch on the PS2 but can not be compared to the possibilities that we are getting today, and I refer in this case to Jak and Daxter, where the developers (Naughty Dog) have done a beautiful job on this subject.  Second: the voice acting, what can I say, I personally found the constant whispering (instead of real voices) very annoying, I even thought there was some kind of malfunction in the CD because of this, until I realized that those whispers WERE the voices.  Third: the story, even though it is a typical platform story, there is no fun in it, I personally found it very boring, and I couldn't play it for more than half hour before I could fall asleep. I truly wish that I could find something good about this game, but the truth is that I had to sell it one day after I got it, neither my son nor I liked this game.  If you truly want to play a good platformer then go for Jak and Daxter, there is no comparison (great graphics, hilarious voice acting -even in spanish-, good story and lots of fun), or wait for the PS2 version of Spyro the dragon, or even play the PSOne versions of Spyro, I can assure you that you will have more fun with those than you will with Rayman 2.  I was deceived by the price drop and the good reviews, and made a terrible mistake: wasted [money], so don't fall for the same, this game can only and hardly diserve the one star I gave it.	-1
I rented the game and had high expectations...but this is what I got.... The game has an excellent story line...too bad they ruined it by getting off the point, non clear directions, and well whoever made this game needs help concentrating! well the graphics are OK....not anything good, but bearable although a few times I couldn't tell land from water and died. then there is the camera (viewing) is way too weird! I mean half the time I couldn't see where I was going! but the worst part of this game was the errors!... this happened several other places also! and if you didn't save your game you lose everything! one other thing was some of the rides like the rollercoaster (if you call it that) will make you sick to your stomach...on the rollercoaster all you are doing is spinning very very fast. and they set it up so it appears on the screen that you are sitting on the seat ...still get headaches from just the thought of it. if you want to try the game be sure to rent it first!!! and make sure you get pretty far in the game (past the first mask) because that is where the trouble starts.	-1
Get it on XBOX 360. The PC version doesn't work on most PCs now (tried for Windows 7, 8.1, and 10). What do I mean by it doesn't work? I mean it literally doesn't work. Won't install (even with compatibility mode and running as an administrator) and EA can't help you because it's no longer supported. The Xbox 360 version is cheaper, reliable, and prettier than this one. But.....you miss out on all the pretty case / manual art which may be worth the price if you're a collector of pretty (and morbidly weird) things.	-1
I was not impressed with this game.  I found that when you hit the key board to move, it was too quick.  I would press it once or twice and it would just spin around.  Overall, I did not like this game and suggest that you look for something else.	-1
...unrealized. Excellent idea, excellent graphics, completely destroyed by endless physical puzzles unrelated to the game itself. Could have been fantastic, ended up frustrating. **	-1
While the thought of playing a psychopathic twisted horror version of Alice in WOnderland appealed to me at first, it quickly became tiresome.  Surely the original story is twisted and psychopathic enough and this version tries very hard to disturb players but it's plot just goes nowhere. When I loaded up this game I expected some sort of stunning adventure, only to be greeted by what seemed to be a first-person action game, such as Thief or Unreal...but no...it wasn't that either. It was 3rd person in the style of Tomb Raider. As I started meeting NPCs I realized where I've seen this interface before:games like Banjo Kazooie, Spyro the Dragon, Zelda and other N64 and Playstation platform adventure games...which is just what Alice is...a spooky platform game. Platform games being what they are, they are obsessed with coming up the most difficult way for the player to jump from point a to point b so that you can then get on with the story. After the 23rd time of falling off the checkerboard, you finally  make it and are allowed to proceed with the story. But what story? There isn't a very strong one. You are just lead by the nose and it isn't even very interesting. Just lots of fighting cards and flying spectre things. I must admit this game IS indeed visually stunning. I absolutely love the cheshire cat. He floats in and ouut of the game quite eerily and his voice is perfect.  The scenery and odd backgrounds of vortexes, huge stacks of books, and such are used to try and make the player a bit uncomfortable or spooked and yes they do their job...but in the process, though, we are not given anything interesting or challenging to do except for jumping from point a to point b 23 times. I was very disappointed with the "puzzles" presented. Nothing was really a challenge but merely an entrance to the next test of patience. To give the game credit, the graphics are impeccable, the gameplay (running, jumping, etc) is flawless and easy to pick up, and the mechanics of the game flow very smoothly. It's just a pity that the creator saved all the fun for himself.	-1
I enjoy animals, and this game makes great use of them.  However, I have found this game to be a bit lacking in the entertainment department, and the creatures in the beginning are quite strange, to say the least (a cow...?).  The controls are also very frustrating; I wish they were more like the Sims or Zoo Tycoon, which are similar (execution-wise) to this game.  I want to like this, but I'm sorry EA Games, I just can't.	-1
Black and white is a very appropriate name for this game.  Some parts are really good, then they become repetitive and boring, and you soon realize that you just wasted your time.  I usually don't rate games low, so when I do it says something about the game.  I am almost mad at gamespot and other review sites, for once, for giving a game--that didn't deserve it--such a high score.  If you want to get a couple hours of fun out of a game then go ahead and buy this, but I would advise you save your money and go buy a better game.  The gameplay for this game is fun for around 4 hours, then you get to the 3rd  level--oh and just so you know there are only 5 'levels' in the entire game--the game breaks down.  They take away your pet, who may I say is pretty stupid and just copies what you are doing, albeit in a very inconsistent manner and half the time just ends up doing more harm than good.  Once your pet is taken away and you start with such a small village it is pitiful, you then come to realize how much time of your life you just wasted.  The villagers in this game are mindless, they can't even make babies without you telling them to and when you do they always over breed.  Also it is almost impossible to be a good god in this game, my people would always keep dying and they were too stupid to even farm right.  The list of annoyances goes on, this is a lame attempt at being an RTS and it ends up falling flat on its face.  The graphics, for the time, were good, though the people in the game did look slightly odd.  Also, I don't know if it was my computer or the game, when you zoom into things, like mountains, they start to mold and change shape as you get closer, a very ugly effect that I never got used to.  Other than that most of the spells worked fine and looked pretty good; though nothing was spectacular, it was solid nonetheless.  The sound in this game is okay, though the first time one of your villagers die and you hear the "deeeaaatthhh" voice, it will take you a while to figure out what it is trying to tell you or whether it is another god speaking (which would make it much more creepy).  The sounds for the people are really annoying and I would rather have text than hear them talk, wait till you hear (or don't hear) the fake Irish accents, they are a pain as is the rest of the voice-over.  Other than that the sound is solid, with the different spells having nice sounds to them, from the rain to the fireball, that help differentiate one from the other.  Overall this game will not give you any lasting value, unless you find this sort of cheap imitation of the RTS formula--with a tacked on pet simulator--enjoyable, then you might have some fun.  Lionhead is a company that promises and doesn't deliver; I hope in their next outings that they learn to make a great game, then praise it.	-1
I purchased Black and White on the advice of a friend and was told about the fun aspects of training a pet. After playing for several hours I can honestly say I was underwhelmed.  While the game's graphics were good, and I had fun for about an hour playing around with my pet and the world, there was little to keep my interest. I quickly moved onto other games and forget that I had purchased Black and White. For me, there was little substance and little to get me "hooked".  While I do not deny that there is a market for games like Black and White, I do believe that this market demands more challenging and compelling products.  If you make it past an hour, tasks become tedious, lifeless and dull.	-1
Black & White in theory sounds like a really fun game and for some I guess it is.  I found the game so tedius, repititious and devoid of fun that I never even bothered to finish the first level.  The idea of the creature is interesting and the AI on it is impressive but that in itself could not hold the game together.  The controls are awful.  It is interesting that the developers spent so much time on the "feel" of the game and making it so it was like no other that it seems that they didn't stop to think at the cumbersomeness an impracticality of the vast array of controls.  Another factor to this game is that if you are going to stick it out and play the entire thing you will definately need time for it takes for what seems an eternity to complete some of the tasks of the game.  All in all, this game was not for me but I could see the ultimate attraction and some people who are willing to stick it out might enjoy it.	-1
Very Very interesting idea and one of the buggiest games I've ever played. The auto-save feature is necessary because of all of the crashes BUT after you've been playing awhile the auto-save can take up to several minutes per save, which can be very annoying when you are right in the middle of something interesting and then, bang, auto-save, go take a nap and come back. After looking at Lionhead's site on this software and seeing some of their comments about Quality Assurance (ie: they basically seem to think that it wouldn't be necessary if EA didn't make them do it), I know that I will not be paying full price for any more Lionhead games until they fire whoever is in charge of QA and actually put in place a real QA process. The idea is VERY interesting and that's why they get some points for originality (or at least an original spin on the populas model of games). But they really need a debugger. Quite frankly I'd be happy to play a FUN game with less then state of the art technology, if it is stable and fun. Bells and whistles are great but I'm looking to have fun not get frustrated. Also, the micromanagement required to keep your people alive is very excessive. It takes alot away from the fun of the game. ... Buy The Longest Journey instead, if you are looking for a great (stable and visually appealing) game at an excellent price!	-1
This game recieved a colossal amount of hype, and from all the hyperbole, was destined to be as large of a step forward in gaming as Populous, also created by Peter Molyneaux. Instead, we have an orangutan flinging feces while peasants starve at the temple because you forgot to dump grain every 30 seconds. I am a huge fan of open-architecture games. I am very excited about AI in gaming on a philosophical level. I was profoundly disappointed. It is true, my animal learned. And my animal seemed to think. But, and this is the crux of it, my animal was EXTREMELY BORING. city maintenance was the essence of tedium. picking up trees one by one and placing them into the lumber depot = not fun. Teaching my pet to do this for me = not fun. Fighting other creatures = not fun. Additionally, encountering the level that reverese ALL THE TRAINING YOU HAVE DONE TO YOUR CREATURE = wiping it off my computer. I have heard that there was a patch to remedy that particular insult to injury, but I do not care. My creature was already damaged goods. So. If you have a friend who wants to hand you a copy for free, give it a shot. Sometimes your pet will be interesting. Some of the spells are pretty. But honestly, this is not worth purchasing.	-1
The game Black and White has some good ideas, such as being God and being able to control what was going on, but it did not meet up to the expectations.  I find it really difficult to get the hang of the mouse controls, and at times it is extremely frustrating.  I agree with one of the other comments made, you are following a story.  You never are really in control!  I find this game disappointing and I suggest looking else where for a game in which you want control.	-1
Dont buy this game if you have a 3dfx voodoo banshee video card the only good graphics are on the creatures,the support is also terrible i called a few days ago and the support person said go to the site and download the patch, after waiting the agonising 45 minute download i tryed to run the patch and then it said"cant patch this you do not have the right version installed" How many versions are there????  two Words DONT BUY IT!!!  Lion head studios is geting NO more buisness from me!!!	-1
Well, this games sucks. It is not even a finished product. Big gaming companies should be punished for not delivering a finished product. It's a different story if a game is not good, but it's totally unacceptable if people have to pay for imcomplete product.	-1
This game is very original with good graphics.  The person who thought this up was very creative.  (...)  However, once you get in the game you will encounter a plethera of annoying bugs.  Some of these are invisible creatures that won't move, creature won't eat or learn, creature won't interact with objects, missing sheep for sheep quest, etc.  So you go download patch 1.10 and install it.  Then when you try to run black and white it will start to run but the game never makes it far enough to start.  It just freezes.  So you use the EAsy program to report the problem (...) and that program locks up your system.  Congratulations, you have just wasted (...) your hard earned money on a (...) buggy game.  (...)	-1
I read Osiris' review about needing the 90MB patch, that is incorrect. That is a patch for the non-English game if people still want to here and see English language. Being from Canada, I guess he would need that. Sorry Osiris, but game companies expect that if you live in Canada and buy the game there, you will PROBABLY speak the local language, not the game's natural English. I admit that that is a huge patch, especially if you own a modem, but at least it was made available to you. I have yet to play the game, which is why I didn't rate it high. However, I ordered it a few days ago, and should get to play it around January. I will write another review about it then. I am fairly sure I will give it a high rating then.	-1
The reviewers who went nuts over this game at the popular magazines and web sites probably felt the same way I did after completing the first of the game's "worlds". After the "tutorial" world where you are walked through the game's premise, story, and how to get things done, I was having a lot of fun and was very excited about the game. Then it all went down the tubes. The supposed Creature AI is non-existent.  It has nothing to do with artifical intelligence, it is merely an if/then database that plays percentages.  It is frustrating and not complex.  The AI won't link consequences to actions so you punish or reward actions regardless of their consequences. The game is very unhelpful.  Since you have to spend a lot of time away from your creature doing quests, monitoring villagers, or scouting around, it would be nice if the game's messages meany anything.  However, when the message "Your creature will now do that sort of thing more often" comes up, it make syou want to scream.  What did the creature do?  Was it good or bad?  Is it too late to reward/punish and teach the creature (and of course it is)?  Who the heck knows?  The game doesn't tell you. When you do get around to rewarding and punishing your creature, you really have no idea if you "got to him in time" or if he is ridiculously associating your reward with another action. Creature Combat is ridiculously lame.  It's a glorified mouse clicking battle that doesn't really mean anything. Finally, let's say you've played a while, feel like you've gotten the hang of it, and want to start over... too bad, there's no such thing as starting over.  First off, you have to go through the tutorial, no skipping, no fast forwarding... so there goes a good hour of your time.  It doesn't really matter if you save or load your game, your "creature's personality" is persistent.  Basically, they were far too lazy to work in a real save/load, so instead they just hardwire your "creature" in, even if you "get a new creature". Yes, the community has developed fan made workarounds and patches.  But this underscores the point.  The fan community has to rush in to save a game that is too restricting and too deceiving.  There is nothing going on under the hood of this "game".  You don't really train anything, since a truly trained creature would not have to be retaught every hour or so, but simply rewarded properly.  And its a fact that many trained psychologists will disagree that punishments are as predictable as the game pretends to be.  But don't worry, your "creature" will clean out its database of "training" while you are away doing other things to add to your frustration. And after a while, you'll get sick of the controls to reward/punish.  You'll be clamoring for a hotkey. What is the one single innovation in this game?  Well, there IS one.  It's the "scribbling" method used to cast spells by drawing with the mouse.  Some people memorize hotkeys, others don't.  This is easy and intuitive, with a helpful legend in the lower right hand corner so you remember that moving the cursor in a swirl brings up the spell you want, etc. One innovation for a truly pathetic game.  This isn't worth your time, although for the first hour you will be amazed and in awe.  Then your frustration will turn to anger, and an oath to never buy another game from Peter Molyneaux (it's no joke his next venture is named Project Ego... how fitting).	-1
After playing the first couple of hours, I started to like the game. Then I got addicted. But the game got very repetitive. I felt like just doing the same thing over and over again. And especially when the stupid creature gets captured again it just isn't fun anymore. Its the same stuff over and over again and it just takes long. I found myself addicted: I felt like I HAD to play. But I found no joy in playing it. It was the same stuff over and over again. And then there were those annoying characters that sing or do other annoying things. And then you find out THEY JUST WONT DIE. Damn this game is annoying. Finally I got myself to uninstall. Damn that was a relief! Now I can play other games again.. games that are actually fun! I really felt like I was relieved of a huge burden.	-1
Don't waste your time. This is forty dollars worth of tweak, and not as much fun as a typical sim.	-1
Short and simple, folks:  It's a nice experiment- a nice buncha folks tossing their creative effluvia into the gaming market, but it just doesn't cut the mustard...  Far from being the ultimate "god game", it's a standard RTS pain-in-the arse, with your good guys always wailing for stuff you cannot provide, and "bad-guy" vilages that you have to provide these same commidities to, in order to impress, and in turn, make "good villages".  The documentation is almost comically inept and insufficient, the system requirements for optimal play are absurd (they say they created the game on 800 MHZ comps, but I SERIOUSLY doubt it), and in the end, you can't help but feel let down. It's a GREAT step in the right direction, but there are better games out today that make use of the full 3d format, and are far more entertaining and system-friendly. Buy it if you want a piece of gaming history- a relic- a laughable trinket that was left by the wayside during a pivotal epoch in game development.  On the other hand, if you want something FUN, there are dozens of titles that will fulfill your needs, and not leave your system frozen, and your mind numb with boredom.   Innovation will only carry you so far, Peter M...  Ya gotta DO something with it...	-1
This game is really boring and it has high systems requirements and video cards problems...... Do not BUY this game!	-1
this is one of the most overrated piles of tripe ive ever played the graphics are pretty but you'll need a pretty hefty card and processor to get the most out of them. my voodoo3 450mhz struggled almost constantly the gamneplay, although hyped up something massive is dull at best. it just boils down to the people want wood so put some trees in the store. the people want food so put some food in the store. the other god wants you to get more land, put food and wood in another village's store. etc... sound is good but it doesnt reallt matter considering the rest of the game is so dull the creatures although made to seem like real children are boring and essentially boils down to ape picks up man, god slaps ape, ape goes "ooh", ape picks up another man. etc... i suppose eventually the ape will learn not to pick up the man but you'll have flogged this game by then. my rating: zip maybe 4/5 if you coiuld use the cd as a coaster maybe	-1
I've had this game for a few months now. At first I loved it. Learning about each individual element of the game (e.g., the miracles, the creature, the villagers, the islands, the opposing gods) was fun and promised for exciting gameplay. Unfortunately, knitting all of the elements together into a comprehensive whole is one area where Black & White needs work. For instance, in order to accomplish anything, you are forced to "increase your influence"--that is, you cannot interact directly with any area of the island that is not under your influence. To gain influence, you have to demonstrate to the neighboring villagers that you are a powerful god by tossing rocks, trees, people, fireballs, whatever over their heads so they fear and/or are amazed by you. This becomes very tedious. It takes ages to gain the influence you need and the process to gain it is not very fun. Alas, I wanted so much to love this game, but it's just too repetitive and slow.	-1
Game - in used condition - does not work on my PS2. It had a lot of stratches and I was not happy. I'll just better off get the Tag Tournament sequel games on for PS3 instead. PS2 is retired. What's the point?	-1
This version is only enjoyable if you prefer the classic graphics of the PS2. Or....If you don't own a PS3 since the upgraded one is exclusive to it.	-1
My interest was first brought to this game by word of mouth. Quickly I realized that my friend and I have completely different tastes for computer entertainment. The sounds were the first thing to annoy me. "We need food",  "we need wood", "we need offspring" "we need, we need, we need" Next thing I knew, I was filled with the sudden urge to destroy my own towns out of plain boredom, and annoyance. Grabbing every person I saw whimpering and whining about what they didn't have, and throwing them off the horizon became the only fun that I had with this game (that fun only lasted 5 minutes). The micro-management was boring and a waste of my time. I gave this game away to a nephew, and just swallowed the loss of my 40.00. Don't make the same mistake. Pass this game up, and buy Sim City if you want to be a micro manager.	-1
This game takes a long time. A VERY long time. For example, each time you start a new game, you MUST go through a tutorial that if you speed through it will take you no less than 45 minutes. Teaching your pet will take longer and your pet will at any given moment learn a trick that you had no intention of it learning.  If you were to have two games, one for a good pet and one for a bad one. IT would take you two hours at least of straight playing to get to the 2nd level.  I commend the advanced AI and the incredible graphics, but the unbearably tedious gameplay makes this game [not worth the money], as soon as you decide that the time it takes to play the game is not worth the effort.	-1
I really wanted to like this game, having heard much of the hype from some time out before release.  However, when I got it up on my PC, I was amazed at how trivial, silly, clumsy and arbitrary it all seemed.  Sure the graphics are good and it's clear that many programmer-hours were burnt in bringing this to market but why didn't they think through the game-play a little before spending all that money on this nonsense?  What a waste! Unfortunately I feel that this is aimed at juvenile/compulsive types who want to spend all day "stroking" their creature and casting silly "spells".  Anyway each to their own. Don't believe the hype - leave this one on the shelf and if curiosity gets the better of you then buy it used (there'll be plenty around let me assure you).  Don't reward the providers of this game by paying list price for it - it'll only encourage them to come out with more sub-standard products. Oh yes, I nearly forgot - there are bugs which cause the game to crash - though in my case that was a blessing as I could use it as an excuse to finish with B&W and play something worthwhile like Unreal Tournament.  Now, there's a game.....	-1
Black and White is an incredible game. I was completely blown away. The game is based on brilliant and wonderfully executed ideas. It is a rich and engaging game with many different levels of play. The gameplay is so varied, I sometimes feel like I'm playing five games in one. It's addictive, it's fun, it looks nice, it has a great interface, wonderful sound, and I'm pretty sure people will be talking about this game for years to come. BUT... It is also perhaps the most buggy piece of software I've ever personally encountered. Several features that were supposed to be in the game at release are not even there at all. The game crashes constantly. A lot of things simply don't work right. Many little issues with gameplay balance combined with countless bugs stack up to one big problem: a barely-playable game. I wish I'd returned it to the store at which I bought it before my thirty days were up. Fans have been waiting for a patch for two months. And just learned they have another few weeks to wait on that patch. The game is absolutely not a final version; it's a beta. Don't pay forty dollars for a beta (really, everyone who has bought the game so far should be compensated for finding the bugs). My advice: Get this game, once the patch comes out... and once you've heard about whether or not the patch works.	-1
This game admirably breaks from a lot of the god games inspired by Sim City and Civilization.  Unfortunately the game designers tried to do far too much with the way the player interfaces with the game universe, gave inadequate in game tutorials and made the manual almost entirely useless.  After many hours of gameplay I couldn't figure out how to build a sustained civilization without giving it constant attention.  I would like to say more, but I just wanted to register my frustration with this game and hopefully dissuade others from buying it.	-1
The graphics are good but the gameplay totally sucks!!	-1
Wheres the 3D motions? Wheres the excitement? Wheres my refund? I bought it, I played it and then I stuck it in a time capsul and buried in my backyard. Hopefully Tekken 4 will have some, I don't know,uhm entertaining qualities you deserve from a PS2 game!	-1
TTT was supposed to be the best fighting game ever, well I'm here to tell you it isn't. The graphics are pretty good, but not much else. It's enivitibility that really kills TTT because inevitibly after a few weeks this game will get boring, and will end up collecting dust on your shelf. Ignore all the 5-star reviews at ..., trust me, TTT doesn't live up tothe hype.	-1
While Black & White contains some entertainment value, it becomes tedious after awhile. It starts out fun, but too much of your time is gradually wasted with micro-management for your worshipers. The AI creatures are very cool however, they really do learn and are able of performing some neat tricks. However again too much time is spent teaching them basic actions that should have been a lot easier (2 hours of potty training is not really fun). Additionally the game is too short if you want it to be. You can blaze through the included scenarios fairly quickly if you put your mind to it. While playing with the creatures is indeed fun, the game bogs down too much in micro-management details, that should have been dumped in favor of more fun gameplay.	-1
This game really isn't fun.  I'm not really sure what is supposed to BE fun about it.  You can't skip through the cut scenes and the characters that play your concience are just annoying.  Even with the trick to make immense amounts of food and wood with miracles you spend all your time trying to make the ant like people do SOMETHING.  I spent about thirty or forty hours trying to enjoy this game and then I gave up.  I had spent a rediculous amount of time trying to get through only a few parts of the game.  Your creature really isn't very interesting.  Sure it learns and everything but even teaching it is just a matter of repeating the same thing over and over and over and over again.  Not something I really enjoy in a game but hey that's just me.  A few "levels" into the game your creature is taken from you and you have to be a god without him for a while.  Right when I was getting a close to getting him back, I was set back another several hours by an attack I could have stopped had the symbol interface not been so slow.  I'm not sure who would enjoy this game for any amount of time.  If you like being in control I'd suggest a Sim game. Another thing I found odd was that this game came on a single CD.  For it's price and the amount of hype that I had heard I would have expected a game which consisted of a little more than poorly rendered worlds in which tasks are set up that are much more like chores than quests. In closing, if you like taking out the garbage and doing other menial tasks, there is a slim chance you could enjoy this game.	-1
For adults, the James Perkins review of Black and White nails this game.  Read it, then skip purchasing this game.  I was very excited about getting it after reading/believing the hype.  The creature and its "leashes" drove me insane, and detracted from the small amount of entertainment I had begun having from solving the puzzles in the game.  Maneuvering is (IMHO) counter-intuitive, especially which way the POV revolves based on the sliding of the mouse.  And the forced tutorial is mind-numbing.  The only worse "forced" passage in a game is the part of NOLF where you have to ask the fat industrialist all of those inane questions.	-1
I was very excited when I bought Black and White and eager to play it.  I had been waiting for this game for a very long time.  After loading everything I watched the intro which got me even more excited.  The game went straight to the tutorial and thats when I started to think diffrent.  The game kept skipping parts, and lagging.  I didn't want to believe that this was happening since I had been waiting forever to get this game.  Through the lagging however, the guides in the tutorial taught me some of the controls, and let me tell you, they are the most difficult controls on a PC game I have ever seen, and I am not new to PC games.  After about an hour of getting nowhere through the tutorial, I decided to play a "single player skirmish".  When I did, the game barely seemed to be running at all!  I was so disapointed that I had paid the money I did for this game.  I think this game probably needed another year of designing because it is just plain unplayable as it is.  I never thought I would be writing this reveiw about a game that was supposed to be a turning point in computer games.  If you are looking for a strategy game, I would recomend you try Age of Empires2:The age of Kings(Greatest game ever!), or if you are looking for an RPG, buy Diablo2.  Thank you for reading, and don't be disapointed.	-1
Somewhere between 3 and 5 years in the making, Black & White disappoints and irritates on so many different levels that it's hard to know where to start.  The non-intuitive control system takes hours of getting used to, and even then is clumsy and unresponsive.  The graphics are not on a par with such recent titles as Giants or Sacrifice, the landscape morphs and warps as you move around it and the villagers, well, the less said about them and their unfeasibly large feet the better.  The sub-plots are supposed to be humourous but are merely twee, as are the good and bad advisors.  Much has been made in the gaming press of the creature AI and it may well be the best ever in a computer game, but the game itself, which should surely be the most important part, is sadly lacking. This may well be selling swiftly, but will be returned to retail outlets just as fast by all but the most persevering of gamers.	-1
I got to see Peter Molyneux demonstrate and explain Black and White in person at MIT in February of 2000. I was intrigued by the concept and what I saw looked great, so I've had nothing but positive vibes toward the game, and snapped it up the day it came out. However, I've got to be honest, this game isn't for everybody. This is the first 'god' or 'sim' type game I've actually ever owned, so perhaps if you're more inclined or experienced with this type of game, you might enjoy it more than I did. However, as an action and strategy gamer, I thought I was going to collapse across my desk and cry tears of boredom. Giving B&W its due, you need only read the other reviews here. Yes, these graphics are amazing, as good as anything out there. The AI is at a whole new level, and there are things going on here that have never been seen before and it makes my head spin to think of how on earth they could have programmed them, like the gesture-recognition interface or the intriguing learning ability of the creatures. This is, no doubt, an amazing piece of art and technology. That having been said, is it any fun to actually PLAY? For me, I'm afraid not. The game very quickly degenerates into an endless cycle of repetitive actions like moving trees and villagers around, all in the name of expanding your 'influence' to encompass other villages, at which point you have even more trees and villagers to move around. Add to this your basic lack of story (do this and this and this to defeat the bad guy!) or characters, and what you have is pretty much a colossal bore in the opinion of this gamer. It's far less Clash of the Titans than it is Competition of the Woodstackers. The micromanagement that you have to perform, and the complete lack of functions, interface, or information to make it any more reasonable, is just out of control. Literally. There are parts in the game where you can't even access the basic functions of saving and loading because those are in your 'temple', and sometimes you don't have a 'temple' yet. And this goes on for EVER, like hours and hours and hours. I read one forum post from an enthusiast who had spent (he said) about 20 HOURS of doing tasks like this to get through a level. And I'd have to say, embarassingly, my own experience is similar. He didn't spend 20 hours because he was a bad player; he spent 20 hours because the game is really that slow. The whole Tamagotchi-meets-King-Kong aspect of the game, the Creature, is an interesting idea but ultimately fails to deliver. The Creature becomes yet another thing that's only partially under your control and which the game doesn't give you the tools to manage. Classic example: the Creature eats one of your villagers. This is generally a bad thing because you need those villagers to increase your 'influence', so you'd want to punish the Creature so that the behavior doesn't happen again. However, the game never says "Your Creature just chewed up a villager." Instead it says "Your Creature will eat that sort of thing more often." Oh really? WHAT sort of thing? And unless you were ignoring the other twenty things that need doing and happened to be zoomed in close enough to actually identify what the Creature was eating, guess what? Your Creature goes on scarfing up villagers. You get labelled by the game as siding with Evil and you suck, and none of it was your fault. Considering that there are only about ten possible things that the Creature can eat, including his own poop, you'd think that the game itself would be a little more informative, or warn you before it was about to happen. Unfortunately, the game is just full of deliberate yet bad design decisions like this. You're informed of things happening only after it's too late to do anything about it. The concept that there is no interface, just a hand, sounds good on paper but is lousy in practice, depriving you of control and information. It's ridiculous that you have to move the camera for miles over to the correct place on the map and then hold the hand over the right building for a few seconds just to get the one piece of information that you want. Couldn't we have put that on the screen? It seems like some of the fixes to make this such a better game are entirely obvious, but were deliberately ignored. Even the game's manual is quite vague and seems to assume that the reader is already familiar with this kind of game, and omits a great deal of information that you'd have to be blind lucky to figure out. Additionally, any claims that the game is some kind of psychological tool, or that your Creature comes out as a reflection of your personality, are just silly. The game basically makes its own call as to what's good and what's evil, and your own intentions aren't figured in at all. In some cases even your actions don't seem to be figured in to that judgment. There's some hype that this is a game of moral and ethical choices, and that is just not so. This game may be a first step in that direction, but this is simply a game of micromanagement; in some senses, it's almost kind to call it a game, period. To wrap up, on the technical end I had no problems with this game on a 1Ghz PIII with 256MB RAM and a 32MB GeForce2. It has crashed once while I was multitasking, but other than that has been flawless, with some frame drop in extreme camera moves but overall seems well above 30fps. Anyway, definitely put some thought in before diving in to Black and White. It's an interesting piece but it's not for everybody.	-1
I was all for this game. I was convinced that BLACK and WHITE was not going to be the next DAIKATANA. No, I didn't want to believe that. But it is true. BLACK and WHITE is an over-hyped game. It was in development for about three years and gaming magazines and such labeled this game as something revolutionary. Well, BLACK and WHITE may be that, but did EA have to make it so boring? The chance to play god should have been fun. In fact the opening moments of the game are the best. My two stars goes to the absolutley fantastic opening sequence of stunning visuals and graphics. And the music that plays really pumps me up for what I thought would be a special game. Alas, this was not to be. After, I choose my creature, the game really slows down the point of bordom. You make choices in the form of "Silver Scrolls". These are quests that happen on the little island your on. This is where the game lost me. As for the controls, I think the folks at EA made them a little to complicated than it needed to be. This to me was the most frustrating part of the whole BLACK and WHITE experiance. If you can't have good control using the mouse with a game, then in my opinion, that game just cannot be fun. Yes, this game is original, but I think some people will be bored. If you want to play god, I think THE SIMS is a far superior game, not to mention fun.	-1
This game is booooooorrrring. My goodness is this game boring. If you're not asleep now, you will be once you've played this thing. I actually think that the talking "Billy Bass" (you know, the one in the commercials that sings) is a whole lot more entertaining than this.	-1
The basic idea is cool, the point being that you are freelancing for some criminal organization running contraband across the border while competing against cops and other organizations. It's finally something new to the basic speeding/car-racing genre I love so much. The problem is that all the skills I've developed in other racing games are pointless here...you start with a selection of two cars, a big heavy SUV (that can take a little more damage) and a cage buggy dragster type thing. Well, in one stage you have to show off your driving skills (no pick-ups or drop-offs of contraband) by beating the other crime orgs, and I was unable to do it in the fast car...so I used the slow heavy one, and finally won. Time and again the heavier car is as fast if not faster. The cops always catch up to you, too. I'm quite good at out-braking and hand-break cornering, yet the cops in their Chevy Tahoes are able to keep up with me, even while driving a 'dragster'. The inability to outdrive the competition coupled with a a fairly boring set of tasks makes this a great game to rent for the weekend, but not to own.	-1
With difficult controls,lousy graphics and repetitive music,this game is a mockery of the great James Bond. Don't waste your money on this worthless shooter-if you want REAL James Bond,buy the movies instead.	-1
If you are looking for a good racing game, look somewhere else. This game has great graphics, but the cars control like shopping carts. If you are looking for a game that is essentially the same thing but GOOD, go buy Midtown Madness 2. Otherwise all you racing fans better wait for Gran Turismo 2000	-1
its not what i thought it would be	-1
Well I'm sure I would have liked the game but this particular shipment would not load on my Playstation so I had to return it. It had that thin cellophane wrapping so maybe a homemade, bootleg copy? Who knows, I got my money back so no long term loss. When the price is too good I guess its a red flag.	-1
When I first got my PS2 ( during its early weks of release ) i got this game with it. The second I started playing it, i wasn't taken away by the graphics much, or the gameplay. I find the story hard, and boring, as well as the rest of the game. Very boring, and very stupid game right here. I still have it but it also has a few layers of dust on it. Skip this one.	-1
This game disapointed me quite a lot. It has bad graphics, but the worst part is the control nothign like any other racing game except maybe pole position for Atari. Bad physics int he sense of hitting others and aceloration and everything. With the bad control I find it quite hard to get anywhere int he game as well as the sight of the game screen just mkes me want to shut it off. Sorry I don't mean to be so rude to the game but I really am disapointed and would not recommend it if you like racing games at all.	-1
This game is awful.  I like racers, but what the heck is this?  This game has you racing against people that are either very stupid or super-human, you are not equally matched against anyone!  .... P.S. Okay graphics are the only plus!	-1
Graphic Wise This Game Is Better Than Goldeneye, But When It Comes To Gameplay This Game Falls Short. I Thought It Was Cool That The Characters Now Speak, But Still Their Mouths Don't Move. The Biggest Loss Is That There Are No More Explosives Or Cool Guns. Where Are The RCP-90's and Remote Mines? If You're Like Me and Love to Fill Your Enemies With Hot Lead Or Blow Things Up You Probobly Won't Enjoy This Game As Much as Goldeneye. Finally There's The Multiplayer, Wich Is Good But Very Cheesy.	-1
If only Rare made this game, maybe it would of been better. I can't even compare this game to Goldeneye or Perfect Dark. Here are the reasons why I don't like this game: 1. When you start a level, you have to wait  5-10 seconds for a level to load, which is really annoying. 2. You have to use a controller pack, so without that, the game is worthless (I think EA really wants your money) 3. The game doesn't even have half of the levels Goldeneye or PD has! 4. You don't have ANY enegry and you get killed quick 5. You can't blow up anything like you can in Goldeneye So compared to Goldeneye, Id skip this game.	-1
overall this game is nothing like goldeneye and doesn't even score any where close to the quality of perfect dark. I rented this thinking it was going to be another perfect dark but its not. Maybe because it's made by ea and not rare, maybe thats it. But overall if your expecting a game like perfect dark you can pass this one up.	-1
This game has got great graphics, even better than the previous bond - Goldeneye. (I loved Goldeneye that was a great game) But..... the very detailed graphics have SLOWED DOWN the game. Compaired to goldeneye this game runs VERY SLOW. The controls are also different. The game play in this new bond compaired to the older one (goldeneye) is just terrible. If you have to choose between the new one and goldeneye buy goldeneye. If your looking for an awsome second bond for the nintendo 64 your going to have to wait. Unless you like graphics over game control don't buy this game!	-1
Well to start off the graphics are terrible.  There so boxy and have no detail whatsover, even when i run it on the highest resolution.  The controls are nice, but the gameplay sux.  I want to just wanted to drive and mess around in the city, but right when i push the gas the cop gets on me for no reason which get's really annoying after about....10 seconds.  And the street lights don't work correctly, when the light turns green the cars don't always go.  If you like games that are boring and full of many errors that could have been easily avoided, then i guess you like this game	-1
This joystick was my last attempt at trying to buy a force-feedback joystick.  Without getting too wordy, there is just far too much deadspace in the joystick's center.  Even spending extensive amounts of time trying to calibrate with the joysticks calibration utility and manually adjusting the calibration with a directX calibrator it was still impossible to get a true center.  Unfortunately, that's only the first problem one is likely to come across.  The gyro motors used to center and move the joystick are very poor.  I found that after as little as 1 month of sporadic use, the twist function on the joystick failed to work properly.  After dismantling the joystick I found that the joystick was just shoddily constructed of poor components.  I wouldn't recommend this joystick for even the most casual of gamers.  Force feedback really, really isn't worth it.  Very few computer games are even programmed with Force Feedback in mind.  I recommend going with a more reliable, spring-based, joystick such as the Saitek Cyborg EVO.	-1
I have had two Logotech sticks: the first, Logitech's Wingman 3D. It lasted a year and a half, but toward the end lost center and never recovered. My second, this one, lasted for 3 months. Then the twist started to go leaving me guessing where neutral on my rudder was (every time). I have read of others who have had similar centering issues: it is a good product out of the box, but the quality of components inside the base are not what I expect.  I ended up replacing it with a Saitek Evo Cyborg Force- it may cost a little more, but it is much more adjustable, and the feel is more substantial to me.  I won't be buying Logitech again from my experience. Some others may have had better luck- but from the centering issue, well that's pretty basic in any flight sim.	-1
This control pad has tiny widdle buttons that are for tiny widdle fingers.  If you have large hands, don't buy this junk, go for the cordless version.  The buttons wear out fast. My buton 1 is already starting to make snapping sounds.  It is for kids, not adults or teens.  The unit itself is big, but the buttons are tiny.  I now have carpel tunnel of the right thumb(aka stiffness and soreness) because of this stinker.  I played Big Mutha Truckers and blew the horn, brakes, and gearshift toggle enough to break the buttons and my thumb.  I will probably go for Belkin's controller instead now.(of course six months rest is in order 1st + a Dr. visit.)	-1
1) Stiff, clicky, small, inset buttons. Nothing like a PS2/PSX pad's nice buttons. 2) Badly placed throttle. The shoulder buttons (which are the clickiest of them all) are big, but if you're like me your pointer fingers tend to travel up while using the shoulder buttons. And that makes for a badly placed throttle above the right shoulder button. 3) Sticks will eventually break off. I got a free replacement LWMRP, but I'm afraid to use it because I know that one will break as well. I suggested to them that they use sturdy metal sticks if they're going to insist on the skinny necks of the sticks, but they haven't modified it yet. 4) Stiff D-Pad/POV pad. And it's hard to navigate with it as well since you can't feel the direction without looking down to see if you're pressing it right. 5) Inset Mode and Rumble buttons hard to press in sometimes. Two great things? The handles and rumble feature. Very comfortable grips and very solid rumble features.	-1
I usually like Logitech products, which is why I'm amazed they would actually put their name on this garbage. To start with, 2 out of the 7 push buttons have intermittent faults while pressing down continuously.  The 8 way directional hat, has a hard time detecting presses to the right. The left Joystick looses it's calibration after about twenty to forty five minutes of game play. After that, it simply will not go to the right.  Since it was decided that this stick was above mere calibration, none was included. The only way to resolve the problem is to reboot the computer when this happens. A real mood killer while playing  any game. I'm a avid gamer and have other game pads, wheels and sticks, so no it's not the computer or USB port. They all work fine, I just thought this one would be better. Next time I'll think a little harder if it say's Logitech on it.	-1
I believe this is not as good as compared to the Sidewinder that Microsoft makes.  It is a very clumsy controller.  It may look like a dual shock playstation controller but by no means does it perform up to the standards of the playstation controller. I got it for(X)and I sold it already for (X) . I tried the Sidewinder and thought it was a better controller and as the old saying goes, " You get what you Pay for."	-1
i wanted simply a PC version of the game Clue i could play against the computer.  unfortunately, this game decides to use graphics that totally stand in the away..  good graphics are fine, but the way these are set up makes moving around the 3-d board super super confusing.  no way am i going to put up with that to play what should simply be a board game (it runs on the same rules as the board game, so no need for these graphics).  at least it seemed to run fine on XP	-1
This game really does [stink].... I've tried on easy and used the cheat menu and still lost. It's confusing what to do and the graphics make it more confusing. If you want to get this game you better be a rocket scientest to figure out it's graphics and the way of trade. You have to get in war to get land and hope the people will be happy with you by the time your finished, controls [stink], don't use your mouse use your up down left right on the keyboard to move your people, the mouse just skrews up everything. And even if you try everything you can either you lose or you have to use cheats and still your called "Worthless" at the end, a bad game to play. With it's simple plan they could get the graphics at least good as the sims, and they could have made the skills easier to understand, it's all confusing to me. Graphics:3/10 Fun:3/10 Gameplay:6/10 Sound:2/10 Overall:3/10...	-1
Encouraged by the rave reviews, I bought this game but ended up tossing it into the garbage after 6 hours of play. Aside from the horrible 1996 graphics, there is dead boring game play on a buggy interface. You spend hours building cities that lack character and armies symbolized by one awful figure. Dragging your people around the map is a real challenge because you can only move them a tiny bit each turn, while getting them onto ships is even more frustrating due to the awkward tile design that governs movements on the map. Historical value is 0, as ancient Egyptians build cities named Melbourne and Helsinki and the American Empire begins with Abe Lincoln in 600 B.C. Do yourself a favor and grab a copy of Age of Kings or even better, Combat Mission--if you like WWII themes--and you won't be disappointed. They do cost more, but you get what you paid for.	-1
Despite almost universal praise in the games press, this is a terrible, terrible game. I'm horrified that it seems to have gathered so many good reviews. It's essentially a dated, semi-professional Quake 2 mod, with the addition of a novel damage-modelling system that lets you shoot people's arms off. Made even worse by a useless attempt to give the game some authenticity - the box, CD, installation and loading screen are covered with warnings that the game is a realistic depiction of modern warfare, all of which exist purely as a tease, because the game itself is essentially a G.I. Joe cartoon with blood. The violence is strictly cartoonish - shoot somebody in the leg, and he hops around yowling - and the novelty wears off after a minute or so. Everything else about the game fails, comically so, from the interactive music (which, because of the game's lack of any slow bits, stays in 'combat mode' almost all the time, negating the point), to the 'stealth element' (make too much noise and bad guys appear in the level, usually in totally illogical places) to the interface, which looks as if it had been drawn by a backwards child. The gameplay itself is pure Quake 2 - you run through a linear track, along which bad guys are placed at regular intervals. Sometimes you have to press a button to open a door. If something moves, you shoot it. Most usually, nothing moves - the bad guys are, in the words of GameSpot, 'strawberry-jam-filled turrets'. Anyway, if you want a decent modern shoot-em-up with stealth elements, get 'Project IGI'. If you want violence, trip somebody up and then jump on them and have a fight.	-1
Ouch. This game is just...ouch. Maybe the developers behind this didn't test the game. At all. That might explain the atrocious gameplay we see here today. The music is the only plus (and that's only because George Williams composed it). Yoda must be rolling in his grave.	-1
Never underestimate the power of the playstation to mess up a game with a great concept. This game looked great all the way through the preview stage and must have stopped there because all the levels are extremely short and easy. The cars are fun to drive but that novelty wears out fast. Do not buy this game expecting to get a game like Need for Speed (eventhough it is made by EA). Expect more of a Twisted metal meets driver. Eventhough that in itself would be a good game, they don't even pull that off. Don't buy this game, instead buy Porsche Unleashed(psx) or 4x4 evolution(dc).	-1
Visually this game is terribly lacking. The car models are swarmed with nasty looking jaggies that I've never seen before in previous car games on the PSX. The models look somewhat decent, but their outward appearance is very grainy, thanks to the jaggies. Not exactly very nice car detail, and I'm frankly disappointed. The environments are very shabby, they flicker like crazy and on top of that look downright pixilated. When you look at the floor, or the backgrounds you should notice how incredibly ugly everything looks, it makes me even wonder if Eutechnyx spent any time on the game from E3 2000 up until the release date. The frame rates are fine, but at times may act up, and don't get me started on the pop-up 'cause this game is right up there with Driver 2. The game's collision detection is also a pile (...), and the overall look of the visuals looks hardly alpha staged, the only good thing I can say about the visuals is that they move and there are colors, otherwise everything else, including special effects look like demo titles running on a first wave PSX tool-kit. But I must admit that the CGs are some of the best in any PS game yet.   The concept of the game is quite good, only if it was better executed. You are James Bond of course, except you are Pierce Brosnan not Sean Connery or the other Bonds, that is bad impact number one. The game's plot is totally unrealistic, you will see Pierce Brosnan in every single vehicle, including a DB5 and tons of other classic Bond vehicles. I believe that it was a stupid move by the developer to only put Pierce Brosnan in 007 Racing, because true Bond fans will be completely turned off by the game. Losing some critical points there, 007 Racing also suffers from un-balanced and boring missions, such as picking up people, shooting down a helicopter with only one try, escorting this person, that person, blah, blah, blah. By the second mission you'll definitely notice what kind of horrendously boring product your playing. If you folks want to know, there are 15 missions to complete, all of which are explained to you in a mission briefing, but none that I would like to listen to. There are a few decent stages, take for example the Highway Hazzard, what you do here is you follow an 18-wheeler and your goal is to pop the wheels on the truck using a hi-tech device. In case you're wondering, the two-player missions need not to be played, you just won't have any fun with them at all. Some of the weapons that James Bond will use are missiles, homing missiles and machine guns, he will be able to use shields and replenish his lives by picking up health kits. Through the game you will be taken through tons of different areas such as New York, Louisiana, Eastern Europe, and Monte Carlo. 007 Racing is a lacking game with a great concept, if only the developer had taken time to balance out the missions, and perk up the visuals, we could have had a great game, but there is always the PS2 version which is currently under development.   Audio is decent, but the songs are far too repetitive and can annoy the heck out of you. The voice acting on the other hand is quite good, but it seems as if Q would rather have the returned in one piece instead of having James back healthy. While playing the game you'll hear Q commenting on your performance, and may give you some hints at times. Most of the time the voice acting is found during the mission briefings by M and they can be quite long, but the clarity is good though so there isn't anything painful to be dealt with. Not bad audio effects, but if the soundtrack was worked on we could have had something much better.   Controls are just too sloppy, every time I try to make a turn it feels like the emergency brake has been hit. The cars have absolutely no realistic feel to them at all, so car enthusiasts must look elsewhere. I'll give the game its nice analog features, both analog sticks work and they have a good deal of sensitivity. I honestly can't say much more about the controls, other than that they feel very sloppy, there is no realism to speak off and the only thing that's good about the controls are the analog sticks.   Sadly what was once a very promising game, turned out to be a miserable failure, 007 could have been a good game if its visuals were worked on more, because I know that PSOne can do so much better than this, the gameplay needs to adjusting and the controls should have been tightened up for better gameplay. With horrible graphics, unsatisfactory and tedious gameplay, and loose controls 007 Racing is barely worth a purchase, let alone a rental, just stay away from this game if you know what's good for you and the Playstation. 6.1 / 10 but it is bond after all so I suppose you will all buy it anyway	-1
What a tragedy this is. It has almost everything going for it. Medal of Honor: Underground sports the best sounds in any game I've ever heard. The ambiant noise in the background is just spooky! Sometimes I can't tell if those footsteps I'm hearing is just part of the track playing or if I have woken up a guard- which means they have seamlessly instilled a sense of danger just by their background music. Also, I like the fact that you are using authentic weapons. None of this "alien lazer gun" crap. The graphics would be passable for the game, but this is where we start running into problems.   For one thing, you can wake up a guard halfway across the level, run all the way back to the starting point, and have him standing miles away from you, emptying clip after clip of ammunition into the walls. And the worst part is, a lot of these bullets, due to the HORRIBLE clipping problems in this game, pass right through said walls and hit you! Not only this, but you can expect to take a ton of hits in this game. True, health packs are plentiful, but doesn't that cut down on the realism? I want a game where my character is somewhat human. Any real person could not take 30 or more bullets to put down. Neither could their opponents. In fact, those Nazis must have undergone some kind of genetic splicing, as they all are some of the best crackshots I have ever seen. I could be standing at one end of a 50 yard bridge (as I have in one of the later levels) waiting to pick someone off, when all of a sudden bullets start whizzing out of the darkness right at my head! This is absolutely inexcusable. My enemies should have the same field of vision as me. And maybe, if it isn't too much to ask, some of their shots could miss their target once in a while.   It saddens me that one of the greatest attempts at a realistic war game ends up being such a flop. I refuse to even look at the first game, despite the rave reviews. This is the closest I have ever come to breaking my PS controller. Back slowly away from this one...	-1
Graphically this is a nice game, but the gameplay becomes repetitive and boring. The cut-scenes, while visually impressive, become annoying very quickly. Also winning battles is far too easy, and there is little story line in the game.	-1
I thought this was going to be like Ghengis Khan for the original Nintendo, but on a grander scale.... it turned out to be more like chess on a grander scale.  The graphics are alright, the game play is lame, and the movies are pretty much the same.  It's not as advertised.	-1
If your a stratagy lover and have patience of steel perhaps you will like this game. It has alot of history to it if your looking for a social studies lessen and decent graphics, but other than that...well...thats about it for this game, theres not to much more i can say about it.	-1
When I started playing this game the first thing that hit me was the terrific battle scenes that were displayed in the well done opening credits and the very similar feel that the game had to romance of the three kingdoms.  Unfortunately after game play began all my hopes for the game deteriorated into a free-for-all of unrealistic combat between armies that I had little to no control over.  I had hopped to be able to have some amount of control over the game but instead I found myself watching volley after volley of animated musket fire and screaming at the computer to let me do something.  Somehow I managed to beat my way through most of the game despite having no concept of the controls. This game is not worth any amount of money, if you wish to play it find a friend and play his copy, renting is simply too much money.	-1
I consider myself an average video gamer (no hardcore by any means).  For some reason, I found this game incredibly hard to play.  The game itself is a very beautiful game.  Graphics are top notch.  But like everyone else who commented on this game, that's about it.  In the first week that I played this (first day just watching the history part), I was rather confused that all I did was keep hitting the X button.  I couldn't even tell if I actually won the battles or if I lost them.  I even bought the matching guide for it, but even the guide was confusing. As an average gamer, this is a purchase I regret.	-1
I went out and rented this after reading reviews saying that it has great visuals, and i agree. It makes full use of its DVD-format. The cutscenes are great, the gameplay, however, isn't. If you've done one level you've done them all. Each one is the same thing, get your army, beat up this guy, and your done. You get very few  choices concerning what kind of troops, and it got very repetitive after the first level. I think it could really have been a great game if they hadn't spent so much time on the graphics. Overall, not a very good game, I found the cutscenes to be better than the game itself. I really reccomend not buying this game, I'd wait until they come out with more DVD format games.	-1
. .  If it weren't for the fact that you just don't get that much in return for the amount of time you spend setting the game up.  The creator of the game spends a majority of the first 3 hours of "game play" giving you an in-depth look at Japanese history, and whereas this is interesting and all, it's not what I bought the game for. I was looking for the old time fun of "Nobunaga's Ambition" (sp?) for the original Nintendo.  I used to spend hours tinkering with that game; playing and replaying different scenarios.  This game doesn't give you the option of deciding which battles to fight.  It just takes you to the next one and assumes that's where you want to go. The animations are. . . good.  Not great; certainly not above the standard I've been seeing in other PS2 games.  The real drawback to the animations is that you get the same ones every time. .  If you fire a cannonade 5 times, you sit throught the same animation 5 times- and you can't stop it once it starts.  If your cavalry charges 30 times, you sit through the same animation 30 times. . . On the plus side:  The whole game is attractive, with more detail per character (story-wise) than many I've seen.  And you DO get a MASSIVE  amount of history in the game (like it or not), not to mention a terrific glossary of terms and additional historical materials on the disk. I'd have given this game 3 or even 4 stars if it had given more to me.  Unfortunately, more money and effort was spent on the animations than the storyline and playability.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE games that require a high degree of concentration, but this just got boring after a short amount of time.  Anyone have a copy of Nobunaga's Ambition?	-1
When purchasing the game i heard all the decent to horrible reviewes it received, but i still purchased it. Dont make the same mistake i did, X-Squad is a truly bad game which makes you second guess PS2's capabilities (at least it did for me!)	-1
This game wouldn't play in my PS2. I tried it on 3 different systems and it skipped on all of them. Maybe it was the seller, I don't know but I never got a chance to experience this game.	-1
I will give credit where it's due, this game does have good graphics and a lot of options.  But that's about it.  I was so dissapointed when I got this game home after having heard that it was "the greatest football game ever" and so on.  this game is such a waste of time.  if this is the best that the playstation has to offer then we're in trouble. The AI is absurd to say the least.  The dumbest plays happen and succede for no reason while simple passes often fly half way across the screen from where they're supposed to.  The computer constantly makes false calls that don't even have anything to do with the play. The play editor is complete garbage.  If you don't believe me, just make up a play and try it in the game. The commentary makes me want to listen to chalk grating against a board rather than the stupid things they keep saying over and over and over again. The dificulty setting is useless too.  The game is the same difficulty no matter where you set it, the only difference how many points you and the computer will score. I could go on for a long time talking about how poor this game is but I'm going to stop and actually go trade it in at EB now instead.  Maybe I'll get a worthwhile game instead, or maybe I'll just sit around and watch the grass grow.  That would probably be just as entertaining.	-1
I thought madden 2001 will have a lot of difference with madden 2000 just like what fifa did, but the game was not even better a single bit! The linesmen in the game still aren't 3d modeled but still are 2d modeled! The graphics may be a bit better but has made the game very slow! Then i thought about the new players in miami dolphins. At madden 2000, dan marino was concederd still playing in real life but was not! And i saw that in madden 2001, Dan marino is still concedered as a player at the dolphins. The whole setup was bad. Madden also put in european football teams which i think is gossip. If those teams they put were real, i'd bet that the players aren't real players at all!	-1
I am a big NBA live fan, and i tell you this is not worth your time!  I have playd LIVE since it was on supernintendo, and this game is a waste!  The graphics are crisp, but the moves are slow, the play control is in no comparison the other versions of live on the PS1.  PLEASE do not encourage the purchasing of this game!!  EA sports did a HORRIBLE job, after madden 2001 they give us this weak title.....	-1
This is a terrible game, not what I expected for a PS2 game made by one of the better known gaming companies EA sports. The graphics are ok, sometimes some of the players look the  same, not to realistic IMHO. The worst part of it is, the gameplay. They seem unresponsive at times and takes awhile getting used to (that is if you don't quit before that) I gave NBA 2K1 a 3 1/2 stars for DC, but after playing NBA LIVE It's a 4 1/2. Save your money and cross your fingers for next years release, or if you have a DC pick up NBA 2k1! Bottom Line NBA LIVE is an AIR BALL! Grade: D GAMER247 is OUT!	-1
This game is absolute garbage.  I opened the box and I could've sworn my dog went in the house.  It is definitely not up to par with other NBA Live games.  Graphically, it looks like they should've released it on PS1 or Sega Genesis.  The players look nothing like the real thing unlike Madden for PS2.  The only highlight of the game is Michael Jordan and I feel sorry that he had to be in this game.  If you want an exceptional basketball game pick up NBA2k1.  If you don't have a Dreamcast just buy NBA Live 98 or Lakers vs. Celtics or even Double Dribble and you can get the same appeal as this piece of junk.  Don't buy it, Don't rent it, and if your friend has one beat him up and tell him that you never want to borrow it.  I have one for sale if anybody wants it.  Never been played.	-1
The only reason why I purchased PS2 over the Dreamcast is because EA Sports only writes games for Playstation.  And I usually love EA Sports games, but this game is just horrible.  I cannot believe that the same company that developed Madden would associate their name with this product. First the positives: 1.) As usual the graphics are pretty good and 2.) the stadiums are customed to the team.  3.) The game play is challenging which could make for fun games.  4.) The one-on-one mode is great and features many of the all time greats. Now the negatives:  1.) I don't believe there is no franchise mode.  That is just a terrible decision not to include the franchise option.  2.) The court is too small, whenever you spin or do a cross over move you go out of bounds or nearly go out of bounds.  3.)  And on that note the game play is not very realistic.  As just stated the cross over and spin moves are too wide. Also in the post you can't back anyone down (they don't move) and the post moves are not very good (no drop step).  4.)  The shooting is terrible, although in the 2000 version it was too easy to hit a shot, in this version of the game it is way too difficult.  Jump shots from 10-15 feet nearly never go in.  5.)  Also it is too difficult to get a rebound.  Your player can be right next to the ball and not grab it, while the computer's men all converge on the ball.  6.)  Sometimes the game does not want to let you dunk when you have an open lane to the basket or on a fast break.  You stop and take a short jump shot, and half the time you miss.  7.)  The menu operations are completely different than other EA Sports games (they need some uniformity). I recommend that you do not purchase this game.  EA Sports should be ashamed of this game and should go back to the drawing board.	-1
One of the most anticiptated sports games for the Playstation 2 turns out to be one of the 1st bombs for the system! I've been an EA sports- NBA Live fan for over 8 years now. Playing it on all the major systems; like, Playstation, PC's, Genesis, Super NIN, etc.. So I'm a devoted NBA Live fan. This game is a complete disgrace to the series! You can tell that they rushed the product to compete with other games that came out the same time; like, ESPN NBA 2 Night and NBA Hoopz. Okay, let's go over the Pro's of the game. Yes it's got Michael Jordan in it, and yes it's got classic legendary teams on it. Overall though, I don't think that balances out the Con's of the game. The biggest disappointment being the response time from when you hit the buttons, to the time it actually does the movement. You can press the button to shoot the ball, and release it before it even does it on the screen. It's that bad! The movements are pretty choppy also, it's not fluent. You can be driving to the hole, and it would be real sluggish. Also, the percentage ratio of making a basket is EXTREMELY low! You can be wide open for a 5 foot jump shoot, and completely miss 10 shots! You pretty much have to dunk it to score. Another big con are the players. Yes, the body shape fits the actual players, but none of the faces look anything like the players at all! I rather take a buffed out Reggie Miller with a face that matches (like in NBA 2K1 for the Dreamcast), rather then the actual shape of a skinny Reggie Miller with the face of a complete stranger. What...some more Con's? Well, they took out the Franchise mode, from previous games, as well as the 3 point contest. Why, I don't know? Next year, they should bring back the Slam Dunk contest on the game (remember Jordan vs. Bird?). Just like they brought back fighting in hockey games! So overall, the game wasn't worth the $49.99. I thought it would match up with the same quality as NBA 2K1 for the Dreamcast, (like Madden 2001 for PSX2 and NFL2k1 for Dreamcast), but it doesn't even come close. I'm getting tired of companies rushing to put out games. Don't they realize that when people are devoted NBA Live or Madden fans (or any game) would rather wait for a great quality game.	-1
As a long time fan of the NBA Live series, I can honestly say that I purchased the PS2 almost only to play this game.  NBA Live 2000 was so good, with the challenges and the unlocking hall of fame players, that I expected this game to blow my mind.  Unfortunately, it only blew a hole in my wallet. First off, the gameplay is sluggish and staid.  Player movement seems barely a step faster than slow motion video.  Power forwards like Elton Brand are treated as 2nd class players, not able to score and rebound.  The post up moves are a big yawn, given the game's focus on guards. Secondly, they eliminated the 'fantasy draft' option whereby all the players are stripped from their team and reordered based on your and the computer's picks.  This option was made even better in NBA Live 2000 as when you unlocked the classic players you could thrown them into the draft too.  We had Wilt and Karl Malone as our back court for example.  In this game, none of that is possible. Finally, the graphics are subpar.  Not only are the faces unrecognizable, but if you notice, all the ears of every player have this white 'glint' in the middle of the ear, making the ear look misshapen, like the slave race that served the Shape Shifter Dominion rulers in Star Trek Deep Space 9.  In addition, no one has tattoos.  I care little for them myself, but given that almost every NBA player has one, what is the point in not doing it here? To be honest, I was so disappointed in this game, I considered returning my PS2.  If you have any desire to get an EA sports game, get Madden NFL 2001, that is an example of what the PS2 can do, and an example of how EA could have done their NBA franchise.	-1
I hope NBA games get better because this is a disappointment.  The game is just like PS1 counterpart, with slightly better graphics.  I bought this game because I wanted a basketball game and that out of all the ones coming out, this is the better one.  Why couldn't EA do the same for b-ball like they did for football & snowboard?	-1
NBA Live 2001 is not a good game. That being said, I will tell you why by arguing againt what EA states are the games high points. 1) Motion-captured dunks by NBA star Kevin Garnett... I had no idea that Kevin Garnett had a policy of doing "soft" dunks. The true power of a dunk is totally left out. Its like your player goes up and calmly puts down a swish dunk. What happened to break-away rims and hanging? If the lame excuse for dunks has been attributed to capturing the motions of Kevin Garnett I say next time invest in any old jo-schmo highschool kid - the dunks would probably be better and have more "umph" and feeling. 2)Challenge Michael Jordan and other legends in 1-on-1 or 5-on-5 games...Who really cares? I say give me a fantasy season mode in which I can put Jordan back on the Bulls and Magic on the Lakers. 3) Unlock championship teams, such as 1972 Lakers or 1986 Celtics...OK, Ok, this is a cool option but I would prefer a franchise mode over anything. Perhaps the EA NBA live people should talk with the EA Madden 2001 people and learn how to make a real PSX2 game. 4) Customize players with everything from height to tattoos...They actually put this is a feature? For a 2001 PSX2 game this is what should be what's expected. On this game I think only about 35% of the PSX2's potential was utilized. Graphics are bland and after 5 games you have seen all the game has to offer. Overall NBA Live 2001 just doesn't live up to the EA Sports name. It's a bad effort at best. Nothing really sticks out. An the game play is not that good. For instance when going in for a layup your players movement slows down. This allows any player to catch up and block your shot. Why the hell does a guy slow to a crawl on a fast break lay-up is beyond me. Take my word for it...rent this game before you buy it so you won't be shocked.	-1
I have a Dreamcast and a Playstation 2 and except for maybe 2 or 3 titles I think the Dreamcast is winning in the gaming department. I bought NBA live and was very upset with everthing but the graphics. Now a days we expect great graphics what we want is game play, and in this area NBA Live 2001 hits the bottom of the fish pond.  NBA2k1 is far, far superior in every aspect.  I believe next year the makers of P2 games will finally use the potential of the system but for today they are not.  So  with that said if you want to play basketball go get NBA2K1 and leave NBA Live 2001 on the store shelves.	-1
MO' MONEY WAISTED,  MO' MONEY WAISTED, MO' MONEY WAISTED, MO' MONEY WAISTED,  MO' MONEY WAISTED, MO' MONEY WAISTED!!!!!!!For all old school NBAlive heads you got what you wanted, your old game back again with a slight facelift. For a system with a 128bits, you would think that E.A. could have improved the graphics a lot with all the time they had to work on it. Game play has not change at all and this disappoints me the most about this game. The need for a "dunk" button is ridiculous. Why can't you just go to the whole and score according to their skill. The only change that's noticed in the graphics is on the action replay. The only props I'm given for this game is the cross over dribble, Sega could have done better. Over all the Nba2k1 is a much, much better game. If you're able to put these 2 games (NBAlive & NBA2k1) side by side, you noticed right off that Sega spent more time in the designed room.	-1
I am a huge WCW fan and I am angry and sad because it doesn't come on any more. I love WCW Mayhem by Electronic Arts, and that was their first wrestling game, and this is their second , but it is something that you dig out of a litter box. I don't like this game because there are only about four weapons laying around and when you use a weapon about three times it turns into dust and that makes it impossible to win a first blood match (they're nearly impossible to win with weapons anyways). Also, the backstage areas that you have to wrestle in are smaller than the wrestling ring itself. There are only about two moves that you can do besides punching and kicking and you have to win a match, which is almost impossible, to unlock a new move. It is also very confusing to even start a match on this game. The graphics would look better if you cracked the television screen with a hammer. WCW Nitro is better than this game. Any wrestling game, even on Atari, if they have a wrestling game for it, is better than WCW Backstage Assault. The only thing this game is good for is to keep a fire burning for a couple of extra minutes.	-1
WCW. It stands for World Championship Wrestling, but maybe it should stand for either We Can't Wrestle, World's Crummiest Wrestling, Wheel Chair Wrestling, or We Can't Win. Either way, Backstage Assault reflects on all of these factors. In Electronic Arts' second WCW attempt, this game makes Mayhem look like a frickin' masterpiece. Let's just do a quick run-down: the graphics: horrible. the gameplay: you've seen better. believe me. the sound: why won't the announcers SHUT UP?? I'm not gonna even bother rating this on my usual scales. I give it a 0. This is pure garbage. avoid it.	-1
I love wrestling sure, I love video games sure. But WCW: Backstage Asssault is NOT wrestling and it's hardly a video game. When EA came out with its first WCW game, WCW Mayhem, I picked it up on opening day. And a day passed and my copy was back on the store shelf. I was looking forward to backstage assault, hoping EA would correct their mistake. NOPE. again my copy is back on the store shelf. First off, I am a wrestling fan, and I love harcore matches. But no ring in the game at all? Wrestling is not just fighting backstage it requires a ring to wrestle in. The graphics run as smooth as silk, I'll give them that. But the sound? Bad. The create a wrestler was the same as mayhem with very few tweaks. Save your money and buy Smackdown 2: Know Your Role. At least thats good	-1
I decided to rent this game upon discovering kiss would hardly be in it. Well i must say, with other dc shooters out there, Kiss Psycho Circus really doesn't give you a single reason to buy it above the rest. It has the basic search for key, shoot a stupid looking enemy, where's a bigger gun element you'd expect, and cant pull it off that well. I don't know why but i really wasn't feeling the level design of this game. Why cant i run around in an abondoned carnival blasting carnies?That would've been cool. In it's defense, it does have some pretty impressive visuals and some cool looking baddies for you to hack up, but since the gameplay sort of fails, so does this game. There's no internet multiplayer, that didn't bother me at all really. BUT what did was the fact that there is NO multiplayer of any kind. That's right, no deathmatch. As it stands, this game warrants a rent if it looks attractive to you but there's better out there.	-1
I got this game and played it for a while.  Enjoyed it thoroughly.  Then I got IL2: 1946, and this game seems like a total joke.  I also got the head tracking kit: TrackIR, and this game will never support it.  Get it if you are nostalgic, but if you want a fun realistic game, get IL2.  You won't be disappointed.	-1
I will admit that I had not played this format of a game before. However, I find it extremely difficult and frustrating.	-1
Alone In the Dark 4: The New Nightmare is actually only rated so low because of how amazingly similar it is to Capcom's classic Resident Evil 2.  Not just a slight similarity either, but rather strikingly identical.  Let's see, a man and woman both forced into a creepy location.  Check.  They both discover unusual and unexplainable monsters.  Check.  They both communicate through a radio.  Check.  They both go around searching for clues to understand the oddness around them.  Check.  Preset camera angles that made the classic RE series popular on the Playstation.  Check.  You see, this is basically a continuation of Resident Evil 2.  Maybe, and this is perhaps a really big stretch, this game would appeal to those who didn't think RE2 was anything to write home about.  However Alone in the Dark 4: The New Nightmare is such a blatant imitation of what I consider the real thing that it's hard for me to approach it with open arms and accept it knowing what Resident Evil 2 is a better accomplishment.  As for the enemies, the dogs look exactly like dobermans from the RE series, monsters that resemble the slow-paced movements of zombies from the RE series that creep around hallway corners in a similar fashion, and monsters that resemble drain deimos from... you can probably guess by this point, the RE series!  Impossible to believe such a clear ripoff managed to make it to the store shelves.  In a way the soundtrack resembles Silent Hill in the creepiness and even surpasses the Resident Evil series in the freak-out department, but otherwise just stick with Resident Evil 2 for the best survival horror experience.  It's like Resident Evil with way less action and more focus on the atmosphere and storyline.	-1
Although I rather like the game and really enjoy the graphics and music of it, I now wish I hadn't purchased it at all. The game is rather buggy. It has a tendency to crash when you attempt to skip dialogue, and sometimes key items simply do not work. One of the online faqs I read explained in detail that sometimes an item simply won't work as it is supposed to, and in such a case, you basically have to start all over. Restarting your PSX/PS2 won't fix the problem. I had that happen 3 hours into the game with the library keys. What a waste of time. Good game; lousy quality control.	-1
Okay, seriously, there needs to be some straightening out here.  Let me get one thing out of the way first: I love this series. The first game blew me away when I played it, and I can't even play it now without remembering just about everything that happened, in sequence. The second game had a nice narrative, but fell far short from the original. I love it, but it deserves the following spanking. Allow me to explain. A few major spoilers ahead.  *Battle System: This is the one big, fat, 800-pound gorilla in the elevator for this game. Seriously, are you people REALLY so ecstatic that its real-time? Parasite Eve was an RPG, and a damned good one at that; ...this... is an action-horror survival game with some amount of RPG thrown in, just enough to earn the genre title for most. It's basically Resident Evil minus the zombies. That's it. The targeting is terrible at all times, the camera angles make it nigh impossible to target the appropriate thing that you want dead, and... well, it's way too easy. Once you've pointed at the thing, you just shoot it. Bam. Dead. Next one. I died, maybe, four times total, two of those were near the end of the game, and one was from that GODS-FORSAKEN MAN-FACED HORSE THING. In fact, I wouldn't even call this an RPG; it's just a run-of-the-mill survival horror, with less horror and more survival - and even that's iffy, because I was only truly afraid, maybe, once.  *Story: It's your atypical "big bad corporation makes things worse" scenario that's been beaten to death before this game, and has been beaten to death since. The only shining moments in this game are the boss battles, which provide just a LITTLE more difficulty than the normal fights (and, if you're a total perv, the shower scene; admit it, you whacked off to that too when you were that age!).  *Characters: Aya and Eve are the only two that stand out in this game, with Aya winning the race by a mile. Still, I would love to see how Eve turns out in The Third Birthday, but I doubt they'll even add her in, since she was sorta a side-effect in this game as well! Everyone else is, for the lack of no better words, forgettable. I don't even remember what the gun-toting redneck's name was! Kyle was wooden, would only show up once in a while, and barely did much of anything to advance the plot.  *Overall: This game was just plain forgettable. The combat only works when you beat it, the story is pretty lame, and the characters are boring. Worst of all, there's STILL no voice-acting (TWO LINES!! They were "FREEZE" and "Hmm". That's not voice acting!), STILL very little background on Aya beyond the "she was in a car accident and got an implanted eye from her sister, who was infected with the Rage Monkey Virus or whatever, and now she can use magical powers that are vaguely explained which were 'awakened' during the events of the first game", and someone STILL needs to give Aya some more personality!  Okay. I think I'm done. Now I need to go play the first game so I can remember what it was like. *deep sigh*	-1
I am not what one might call an overly hyped video game player. I don't go out and buy the next installment of FF (after VIII, it really got bad imo), I enjoyed .hack and its storyline though (but I felt that the series could have been brought together into one large game like with FFVII). Then there is the PE video game, I loved the first one, had some trouble, but over all it was a great game. I knew there was a part 2, so I found a copy and started playing it. Boy...was I disappointed.   First, the game play is terrible, the movement is haphazard, the angles are horrific, and its down right troublesome (unlike the first one). I loathed the movement, there was none of the smoothness of the first one.   Second, I hated the leveling, what leveling there is. You don't go up in your hit points, you barely go up in MPs and parasite powers, and even worse, when you go to a next scene (from one point to the next in the story) you go back down to your 100 hit points.   Third, which is related to the angles, the combat is atrocious. There is nothing quick and exciting, in fact its down right stressful because (since you rarely have a chance to get items for health unless you spend "money" between the scenes at home base) you end up dying again and again until low and behold you get through with maybe 1 hit point left and then WHAM you are hit by another attack and you have to do the whole stupid thing over again. Even worse, the camera angles are so bad you rarely if ever see the enemies and just shoot blindly.   Fourth, connected to three, the weapons are horrible to use. You end up getting killed repeatedly because you have to jerkingly reload so many times that when you are facing multiple opponents (unlike the smoothness of the original first story) and you're going to get killed unless you spend hours dealing with one combat situation.   Fifth, items, with the original first game, you got lots and lots of items. With this game, you are in luck if after three or four attacks (bringing you down to 1 hit point) you finally strike it and get a recovery2 pill that brings you back up to original hit points but then again those hit points are taken down again by the end of the next combat round.   While the story line might be interesting, it fails in comparison to the first one and by all means, the poorness of this game in the controlling just makes you so fed up that you don't care how this story ends. Its a bad, bad game that could have been a great sequel if only the company had followed the original game's beauty. Dont buy this game unless you have lots of headache medicine.   I can't believe it, but I actually hate this game.	-1
man this is a poor game i bought it, played it for an hour and thought this cant be it but it is... theres no voice acting so the atmosphere is cack and the battle system is really bad. a game like this relies on gut feeling and instincts, not to be told how much hp was taken off the player should not be told. The cut scenes are good and the camera at the beginning (i sold it after that) was reasonably good. This game just feels like a sub-par resident evil. Even the graphics are not upto resie standards the developers didn't use pre renders like capcom so the areas look ok at best. The enemies are reasonably well animated and look solid enough but don't provide the visual oomph that resie's deadites do. You shouild be able to see the flesh hanging off them but nope. Whats with the rpg elements too? Again it detracts from the atmosphere when you recieve bp or whatever from kills and use it to upgrade, it just doesnt work and feels tacked on. If they were goimg to do something like this then they could have ,made it at least a bit more in-depth like other rpgs.  There are many faults to this game and all add up to a below standard rpg/action type thing. not good at all. If you're wanting survival horro best check out resident evil 2.	-1
The first PE had problems - Aya's painfully slow movement, some bad camera angles, etc. - but was overall a good game.  This ... this is a travesty. First, the movement system is *miserable*.  Character-relative movement is an abomination, painful, and results in many many deaths.  Second, Aya's Parasite powers are pathetic - how did she go from taking on Eve and the Ultimate Being to this!?  Eve would have turned this Aya into mincemeat.  Third, why is Aya suddenly young and dressing in bizarre fashion?  I dunno about you, but *I'd* wear body armor, or at least long pants, when confronted with creatures like that. In terms of plot and characterization ... there isn't any that I had the patience to see.  Aya's sole reaction on seeing a human (or apparent human) mutate boils down to so what.  This, from a woman who freaked at seeing the rat mutate, who has not seen anything else mutate since finishing off the Ultimate Being ... who seemed to think nothing else was going to mutate. Stupid puzzles, uninteresting secondary characters (where's Ben?  Maeda?  Daniel?  Wayne?) ... Pass on this one.  Play the original again.	-1
Outlaws is a first person shooter set in the wild west. The story line is you play the hero and have to rescue your daughter from the villan. Built on a outdated engine with wonky physics, Dated graphics and a 2.5D design. Very dull gameplay with no atmosphere and a box of rocks AI. Gameplay is nothing but shoot the baddies, Find key, Open door, Shoot more baddies, Find another Key ect ect. Outlaws is very dissapointing.	-1
Nice Game But i was expecting A lot more... Dont expect Much	-1
This is a game only for members of the Tomb Raider Fanatics Club. If you remove all the hyperbole and wishful thinking. This game is just another rehash of the older, CHEAPER, Tomb Raider titles.   Sure, you have new weapons and some new moves but it all adds up to the same thing: A big yawn! The game's clipping problems and crazy camera angles made things even worse. People who gave this game a good review must have been in a very magnanimus mood, or they must really enjoy ogling Lara Croft's enormous "guns".   It's time for Eidos to stop milking this cash cow and deliver something different to the gaming public.	-1
I picked this up in a bargain bin because I had heard great things about Grim Fandango, now an admittedly older title.  I had also played a demo of one of the Monkey Island games and found it hilarious.  I greedily slapped down my ten bucks and looked forward to some fun.  The game is fun to listen to and watch.  Filled with yucks aplenty, Grim Fandango is like participating directly in a wacky animated film.  For this alone, Fandango earns high praise.  As with the Monkey Island games, the voice acting and humor is top notch.  Sadly, gameplay suffers.  If you read through enough reviews here at Amazon, you'll find that people like Fandango simply for its humor and style; most customers admit that they needed walkthroughts to get past the game's frustrating puzzles.  I'm a puzzle fan, and I like a challenge, but there were simply too many moments in Fandango where the puzzles felt arbitrary. Logic rarely led to a solution; only trial and error did!  For me, this weighed heavily--and I mean heavily--against the game.  Humor and style, huge plusses no doubt, should still be secondary to gameplay (or at least equal).  With Fandango, gameplay seems to be a less important means towards creative and hilarious ends.  You'll need to decide if this is okay with you. For me, it wasn't.  For music reviews, visit [...]	-1
Am I the only fan of the first 2 games that doesn't like this one? C'mon, underneath the funny intro, the vastly improved graphics and sound and the overall presentaition of the game, is there really a game that lives up to the first 2? I would have to say no. The graphics, as good as they are, are way too cartoony. The jokes (aside from the intro) are either not funny or are non-existent. The puzzles are almost all really obscure. The plot is incredibly cliched (save the governer - AGAIN). I can't help but feel that had this been released almost immediately after LeChuck's Revenge with the same graphics and sound that it would be scorned apon compared to the other two. Generally, I don't find this at all fun to play. Adventure games are one of the few genres where older games are still good for the simple reason that they don't need superb graphics or the latest technology. They need good puzzles and a good plot. They need you to get engaged in the characters. Just check out the first two games and ignore the lack of technology - they are much better. My favourite adventure game though would still have to be Full Throttle. Now THERE'S a game.	-1
Red Faction is a futuristic first person shooter set in mars. You play parker a miner in mars who fight against his employers. The game loads data and runs great, The graphics and sound are ok but the geo-mod technology is not as good as they said. The single player is very disappointing. It is a fairly long game but the gameplay is dull because of the poor level design, dumb ai and nothing new. It is not very hard but the designers don't know where the player would run out of ammo or health. Red Faction is very disappointing.	-1
The basic idea behind the game sounds fun. You're an SAS officer, sent off on a number of missions to save the world. It's a standard FPS shooter, made a bit more exiting by the 3D landscape engine which allows the action to take place across large outdoor environments. The emphasis is on "real-world" fighting - where taking a couple of shots will kill you, and so you spend most of the time creeping around hoping not to be discovered. There are plenty of gadgets to play with too. The Satelite camera allows you to view the action around you from above, and zoom in on activity in outdoor areas. When you use the camera, the map is shown full-screen and the action caries on around you in "real-time". If you're not careful you can get killed while looking at the map. This "real-world" emphasis can be great (try games like SWAT3), but the game designers need to finely balance "reality" with "fun". Unfortunately this is where Project IGI shoots itself in the foot (as it were). I couldn't even get past the first level on "normal" difficulty. I'm not that bad at games (I've completed Half-life, Star Trek Elite Force etc.), but try as I might I couldn't get through the first mission. I'd get 5 minutes into the level and get shot by a sniper - there's no save game feature, so you have to go back to the start of the level. A boring 5 minutes spent working through the part of the level I'd already completed, shoot the sniper... and then got shot by someone else. Guess what ? Another 5 minutes going back over the exact same level again! After I'd played through the same part of the same level 10 times I just got bored and went to play something more fun instead. As far as the rest of the game goes, other than the outdoor maps, there is very little special about the graphics - they're pretty much Quake2 engine standard (sub Half-Life). All that running around, climbing ladders etc. is pretty passe these days (how old is Tomb Raider ?), and there is really nothing new that this game does. I originally bought the game because PCGamer UK gave it a good review. As it stands, without a save game feature, I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. If Eidos get around to patching the game (there's no sign of it yet), and adding the ability to save your progress within a mission I might start playing it again. As it stands, I'll stick with SWAT3 Elite Edition... "The element is behind you!" or Counterstrike. Pro: 1. The satelite camera is quite cool. 2. Outdoor environments make a change from usual FPS. Con 1. You cant save your game. 2. Too easy on "easy". 3. Impossible on any difficulty setting above "easy" (partly because there is no save game option). 4. No multiplayer. 5. Dodgy voice acting.	-1
You heard right, this game has no SaveGame. It 'saves' only at the end of each of the 13 levels. The levels are huge, and 1 shot can kill you, or raising the alarm, or 50 other things. They say it's for realism, truth is that Eidos wanted this game out by Xmas. Unless you like being very frustrated, and repeating a level from the start time after time after time, buy something else. If you played SOF on hard setting all the way through without saving, go ahead and get IGI, otherwise you'll have to play this game w/it's 'trainer'. It's a hack that gives you unlimited health, but that takes alot of fun out. Design is monotonous with only 10 buildings that just repeat level after level. So overall, close but no cigar. This COULD have been a cool game w/a savegame and more levels, but it's not. Try NoOneLivesForever or something else AT LEAST until Eidos offers a savegame patch. This game is 95% SOF(great game),and 5% cool, new ideas like cameras,alarms,real weapons, but without varied design & all ruined by an unforgiveable mistake. Save your money.	-1
The control of this game is awful. Graphics are average, sound below average and did i mention the horrible contols? Pass on this one and find a better FPS there are several out there.	-1
This game is different for a First Person Shooter...quite a bit different concept that most games, but is too difficult to control.	-1
Although a decent FPS, it fails in comparison to the N64 titles that have dominated the console FPS market, Goldeneye and Perfect Dark.  Don't expect too much and you won't be too disappointed.	-1
This game isn't as good as most of the 1st person shooters on the PS1. For a release on the PS2 this is a pathetic excuse. You'd be better off buying Syphon Filter 1 or 2, or Medal of Honor for the PS1, or waiting for new versions of those games to come out on the PS2.	-1
Is this PS2 graphics or just taken from the original PS? The graphics are for the most part dated and very weak looking and the game is only semi-fun if you play the multiplayer death matches. Personaly I prefer Unreal Tournament for PS2. If you want to buy this game at least rent it first, or if not, it's your funeral.	-1
Just a warning for those that aren't familiar with the Alone in the Dark series that they may want to try the demo first.  The reason being I tried the demo and have never been more unimpressed by a game hyped such as this. Fans of the Alone in the Dark series might find the sequel entertaining but some of my gripes with the demo - (And keep in mind it was the demo so I can't give you an idea on the entire game, but like I said, the demo made me determined not to buy the game.) -- The perspective is constantly switched.  In other words, in one scene, you are looking at the front of the character, when he moves to another area (zone) that is downloaded, you are looking at him from the side, etc...  Each small area (zone) has to be downloaded and the viewing perspective constantly changes which is very annoying. -- The mouse didn't work.  At least on the demo.  It was keyboard only. -- Great FX on the character, but the scenery (especially the pouring rain) was TERRIBLE.  It was a giant clash comparing this beautifully, lifelike character with some aspects that looked like the old CGA graphics. -- The gameplay system was very cumbersome.  It wasn't managed to give you a smooth flow when you are switching items, etc.. With lack of a better way to explain it, the game reminded me of an 80's game.  For instance, the downloading of every small parcel of land (zone) as opposed to smooth flowing through the entire area like ALL games today.  And as far as the horror/spooky theme, it was very cheesy.  I would recommend Clive Barker's Undying as a game that is everything this one attempted to be.	-1
I hate this stupid game it's not as good as attitude	-1
With new matches, more characters, unlockables, more moves, better graphics, better sound, better gamplay, and more moves per character - This game should be an easy five star. Sadly with all the new features, Smackdown 2 comes with some cripplingly slow loading times, especially compared to the very speedy Smackdown 1. The season mode in Smackdown 2 takes such an exceedingly long time to get through just one week it is hardly worth playing. Although the load times are high, if you don't mind them you will have an awesome gameplay experience.	-1
Compared to WWF No Mercy, or even WCW NWO Revenge, THQ have gone a big step down for these playstation versions.  First off, the controls are stupid, on the N64 they are easy, and you know what you are doing, on the playstation they are confusing and plays more like an arcade beat 'em up then a wrestling match. And I really hate the way you do specials in this game.  The Create A Wrestler was the first thing I tried out, it's ok, but too confusing, the lists are too long and numbered instead of telling you what it is. I couldn't even find a DX shirt to put on. The music is pointless as it only shows about 5 seconds of the titantron before it cuts to the next bit, I couldn't even find half of my fave. moves, yet there in the game somewhere and you can't even pick a height, you just have tall or short instead of the actual stat.  But what really bugged me about this game is season mode. It's confusing to even start one, but it is frustrating to have to have to go through every match of the show either watching it or simulating it, i try to skip them all to the match i'm in, but it takes too long with annoying music and then takes longer to load a pointless scene saying, "whoever, had entered the building" ... big deal, why did they do this? why not just do what has been done with the other 64 games and just go from your matches next to next instead of wasting your time having to simulate every other match, with no way to skip ALL events till your match, or have you spend about 10 minutes simulating through a show that you're character is not even participating in.  this game hit rock bottom and laid the smackdown on nothing but itself. Play the N64 versions cause these games are not down with it and thats the bottom line cause I said so.	-1
This is the worst game I have ever played on the Playstation. It takes way too long to load, the gameplay is slow, and the graphics are just terrible! I can knock my opponent over the head numerous times and he'll just stand there! I could hit my special until I couldn't no more and throw him off the top of the Hell In a Cell. Then I could hit all my specials again and pin him and guess what? I WOULDN'T EVEN BE ABLE TO GET A FREAKIN' ONE COUNT! Then you have to dive halfway across the wrestling ring just to get the darn championship belt in a ladder match. You can't 3-D anybody through a table either. THAT STINKS! The only ways you can drive them through a table is: Powerbomb, Piledriver, Rock Bottom, or a top rope move!!! Gosh, that really stinks! And in the Season Mode it will make you do all sorts of B.S. loading just so it can say: '(Whoever) Is here tonight'! or '(Whoever) seems satisfied with the victory'! That is downright pathetic and very exhausting! The game freezes sometimes and loads too much. DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH! Rent it, but PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS GAME! SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE! ...	-1
Well the game is good..... lots of players....but here are some cons............ lots of them..... 1) They walk like girls. 2) The weapons don't do anything. 3) They don't bleed. After all the beatings. 4) If you fall of the top rope or the hell in the cell. They will get  right back up. with out any damage. 5)The season is soooo boaring..... my cousins fell a sleep, when i was playing it. 6)Every time when micel cole interviews some one, after the interview he will srug like he has no idea of what the hell is going on. AND I COULD GO ON................. BUT LETS STOP..........CAUSE I AM TIERD OF TELLING THE TRUTH TO THE WORLD AND SAVING PEOPLE FROM THIS CRAP...... UR WELLCOME. :-)	-1
Let me get to it:  The wrestling engine, player lineup and create-a-wrestler are the most amazing things I've seen and are what make this game (except for 3-way or 4-way, because selecting which wrestler you are fightins is really annoying and those matches go FOREVER). The thing I don't get is what's with the career mode?  It is simply the most infuriating thing I've ever seen. You have to sit through all the matches on your "TV Show" or "PPV" (of course, you can skip them, but that takes 2 minutes a pop, JUST TO SKIP!), and your wrestler isn't even always on!  Why do I have to sit through 7 matches that I'm not even playing in.  SOOOOO BORING!  Also, the cut scenes are an embarassment.  There's like 5 different ones, and they take so long to load they are not even remotely worth it any shape or form. Hopefully Smackdown 3 will solve these problems.  If you have a bunch of friends and want to play this, get it, but if you want to entertain yourself, I'd wait.	-1
While the lastest and greatest wrestling game for playstation is much improved, it may be just a little too advanced for playstation, as it seems all you do is look at pictures of your favorite wrestlers while the graphics are constantly loading.  Once you actually get into the matches though, the game play is pretty fun, with all the special moves of each wrestler.  There is a need for commentary from the real announcers to give this game a more realistic feel.  Overall a game that I can't wait to see on Playstation2, because all the loading time won't be there anymore.	-1
Thank goodness that I rented this game.  This game is much better than the first Smackdown game.  The create a superstar feature in SD1 was a joke.  The create a superstar in SD2 is bigger and more extensive.  There are still major problems.  1) The color option graphs are difficult to use.  You only see the colors change as you scroll through the graphs.  Then you'll have to right down the number value for each color you chose for future use.  2) Once you've chozen and saved certain features, you can NOT change them.  I made three characters.  Each one took about 45 minutes to make, including moves.  After a few hours of gameplay, I wanted to change the characters names and/or entrances.  This can NOT be done.  The only way is to completely re-make the wrestler all over again.  If you didn't wright your information down, it will be another 45 minutes out of your life.  As far as the wrestling matches, Smackdown 2 offers many fun options.  Table, Casket, Ladder, Hell in the Cell.  However, the big draw of SD1 and SD2 is supposed to be the career modes.  The career mode in SD2 is actually WORSE than the first.  I can't understand why a player has to sit through wrestling dates that don't feature the player on the card.  You can skip the matches, but this takes time.  You WILL have to watch the all too brief cut scenes.  After 5 dates of inactivity, I used a cheat process to make myself number 1 contender for the Light Heavyweight title.  I finally got to play.  I, nor my other creations, were ever asked a question by a WWF superstar.  They weren't part of the story lines.  In the FIVE days that I rented the game, I only saw 1 of my guys in ONE cut scene. This is ridiculous.  A personal grief I have over SD2 is the inability of female wrestlers (other than Chyna) to go for WWF titles other than the Woman's Championship.  I don't know if this was a decision by THQ or the WWF or both.  I feel ladies should be able to at least compete for the Tag and LH belts.  There is only one major flaw with gameplay.  In matches where there is more than one opponent, the player has to manually change the focus of which wrestler he wants to attack.  This can get very confusing.  A player can wind up punching in the wrong direction or attack his own Tag partner.  That's my review.  I enjoyed my rental time, but I wouldn't pay money to own this game.  If you don't already have it, and you don't mind the old talent line up, I recommend buying "WWF Attitude."  If you have an N64, I recommend "WWF Wrestmania 2000" over "WWF No Mercy."  Read those reviews to learn why.	-1
All I have to say is that this game is horrible.  I found little in it I liked and I loved all the others in the RE series. I found the gameplay to be almost "pre-RE1".	-1
Rockstar, the developers of this awful game, sure have been pumping out the PS2 games. Smuggler's Run was fun and all, but this is just too bad. It fails in every way that a game can. The visuals are sub-par (PSOne games look 10x better than this), it controls like a cow, and the actual gameplay is repetitive and a chore to play. Not worth your time.	-1
Let me begin this review by telling you that if you are going to start this game, prepare yourself to finish it. Put on some nachos or grab a large drink because there are no save points. The game follows the classic RE storyline, but adds a twist. This is a nice game to obtain if you are not digging the new plot-deviation of RE4, 5, and 6. Also good to complete your collection in the same vein as Umbrella Conspiracies. So, on to the game itself...  The game will take you anywhere between 1 and 3 hours to complete. Any longer and you should be checking your pulse. I was getting tired of not being able to save, mainly out of boredom, but I toughed it out anyways. My first time through I played lazily and ended up with a B ranking and 2:32 something. I have no intentions of improving on my rank, as the only interesting part is starting the game over with all the weapons you acquired in the previous run-through. A quick read through (or follow-along) with this guide : [...]  will help you get through the game very fast. It's so short that you can print it on one page.  ________________________________ My pros :  * First-person shooter perspective adds a whole new element to the series, and actually is very scary. I yipped more than once when the dogs jumped up at me or the hunters were lunging at my face.  * The game follows classic RE style but with a twist in the story line that somehow still folds together.  My cons :  * Voice acting is BAD. I mean original RE bad. Maybe even worse. It's just gross!  * Graphics are a suckfest. Blocky, ugly, sketchy...REDC, RE2, and RE3 all look better on my TV.  * ZERO replay value. Like renting a movie you only watch once.  I heard there was a rocket launcher to obtain but that's too easy. Give me an alternate character or alternate story line instead!  * Disgusting side story. Why the developers thought they needed to concoct a story that involves abducting pre-teen children and cutting open their skulls for extraction of pituitary brain matter for Tyrant growth is beyond my comprehension. Disturbing at best, distasteful at worst.  ________________________________  Get this game if you are really a die-hard. Otherwise you'll be better of skipping this one - and believe me, you won't miss much!	-1
1.the graphics are rehashed from the other games mostly RE 2 only they look crappier. 2. the items are floating, spinning defiances of physics and common sense. 3. the motion capture is terrible, the enemys that are gifted with the ability to jump (a skill denied to the player.) the enemys seem to slow down in mid flight. the zombies shuffling motion seem to be all the more drunken puppet show than usual. everything looks like crap 4.the voice acting is terrible these people did not care about their job. it was like they were all bored. they all sound completly detached from reality. they have no emotion in their voices. except the sewer dwelling homless balding hobbit. it sounded like they had a grand total of 3 voice actors for the entire game. 5.the weapons are completly random, you have the Glock 17 and Sig Saur and a Berreta in the same group as a Nambu which is just confusing. and to furthor confuse you, you get a M70 grenade launcher which is almost useless. then a Spas 12 and a S&W model 19 revolver. and you don't get enough SG "bullets" like their the rarest ammo to find. 6. the 2 children in the game are stupid lilly apparently survived only because she apparently is so brain dead the zombies either except her as one of their own or fear her because she could make them dumber. and lott has the most anoying voice ever. 7. Game play is boring there is just massive dead zones with nothing there. for no reason except to take up game space. the targeting is just annoying the dogs are like crack head fast and will fuse with your legs after a period of time because you cant look down. and while they are down there humping your legs? they absolutly refuse to do damage to you. the zombies are just there they are no real threat. they are really more of a minor annoyance or target practice. the Hunters and Lickes are just epic failures due to their decreased intelgence attack and HP. it is the only RE that i know of that you can shoot a hunter point blank with the 9MM pistol while standing still and not only live but get away with fine health 6/10 times. health items are way to sparse competing with SG ammo in frequency. 8.the translations (the phone "hang" up) that is the line that says it all. "I cant remember" is stated at least four times like a rapid fire machingun of i cant remember caliber. is just blazing away. this is one game that i wish i could havebeen hit by one of those bullets and forgotten about it. 9.in  conclusion it is not as bad as the playable failure known as big rigs. its still pretty bad. but at least the enemy has AI. and there is some concept of physics and there is background music. but it doesnt play like an RE game. there is just one thing i cant get over it seems to be so laggy and slow.	-1
WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT! FOR THE RESIDENT EVIL SERIES, THIS GAME REALLY SUCKS BIG TIME. THE STORY IS LAME, THE CONTROLS ARE DIFFERENT FROM PAST RESIDENT EVIL GAMES. FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED WITH A RESIDENT EVIL GAME. THESE TITLES WERE MEANT LIKE THE FIRST 3 RE GAMES, THIS GAME SUCKS LIKE RE DEAD AIM. IF YOU WANT A GREAT RE GAME, GET THE FIRT 3, PLUS CODE VERONICA X, AND RE 4, NOW THESE ARE RE GAMES. NOT THIS LAME RE SURVIVOR.	-1
Resident Evil Survivor, the black sheep of the Resident Evil family. Compared to the rest of the Resident Evil's, yes, this game is bad. However, it is not unplayable. The lack of any and all save points means that you're going to have to go thru the entire game in one sitting...and that can be quite a challenge. However, considering how easy the game is, it's not because of difficulty. This game just is bad. Now, if you have a bunch of friends over who love Resident Evil like you do and you just want to be able to say you beat them all, this game does have some redeeming value. It's great for a laugh with a group of friends at just how bad it is. This game is more of a collectors item for those who want to have the entire Resident Evil series and who want to beat them all rather than for those who want a fun and enjoyable game to play. Stay away unless you're Resident Evil thru and thru. NnyCW for CapCity.	-1
Graphics are terrible, the controls are clunky as hell, but it does have an anime opening. That being said, that's like the only good thing about it. Not to mention that the plot is a blatant ripoff of Ghost in the Shell.	-1
The Good: Nice anime cut scenes, lots of levels, smooth combat animations  The Bad: Clumsy and cumbersome controls, boring levels, lame objectives, no mid-level save, unfair checkpoint placement, flat ugly textures  Oni was a very hyped anime style game back in the day. This game was made by Rockstar before getting into the 3D Grand Theft Autos and other games. This game has a lot of potential, but is flawed in a lot of ways that make the game more boring and frustrating than bad. With that said, the only redeeming quality are the good-looking combat animations and challenge.  Right out of the gate you will notice that the controls are completely upside and backwards. All the combat moves are on the shoulder buttons. Why in the world they thought of this is beyond me. You actually don't really use the face buttons all that much. This make jumping, fighting, and shooting clumsy and cumbersome and you can't change the controls to something more natural. These are just some of the worst action/adventure controls I have ever used. The actual combat is fine, but executing these moves is a pain. I felt like I was stumbling over myself because I had to think about the controls. These just aren't natural! Jumping with R1, L2 and L1 are kick and punch, and you pick up items with R3. What?! I felt like I was trying to solve a Rubix cube, not play a game.  Secondly is the exploration factor. The levels are boring. They all look pretty much the same with flat boring textures and the design is confusing and labyrinthine in some levels. There's no direction and your compass is useless. The bar gets smaller as you get near an objective, but if you are two flights down it will act like you're standing right next to it. Enemies are stupid and clumsy, boss fights are frustrating, and the game just can't compensate its own design with the clumsy controls. I can't tell you how tired I got after just three levels of finding this colored console to open same colored door over and over again.  The story isn't really worth sticking around the 14 levels either. The anime cut scenes are nice, but you probably won't even get through this slog of a game. I tried really hard to keep going, but there was never a change in pace. It didn't help that there is no mid-level saving and the checkpoint placement is unfair. If you quit in the middle of a level you have to start all over. There are just a lot of annoying things with this game, but even if it was flawless you still have the fact that the game is just boring and not very fun.  When it is all said and done only the hardest core of anime fans will stick around until the end. You really had to have played this when it first came out, then come back for nostalgic purposes. The game is just clumsy and boring, but has so much potential if only the developers spent more time on the game. As is stand, I really can't recommend this to anyone.	-1
I enjoy playing these old titles sometimes you find a gem you skipped over, and sometimes you find a turd. This game is a turd.  Remember the earlier days of gaming when the box cover was usually more exciting than the game itself? Well it's pretty much the same thing here.  Hands down the most incredibly difficult game you will probably ever have the opportune chance of playing. Nearly impossible to beat thanks to the games mechanics. You'll at times feel like your trying to take down a tank with a sling shot with the powerless weapon selection they provide you.  The controls aren't that great but they aren't that bad. This is the first time I had to use a cheat code to survive in a game since Duke Nukem... and I mean the original side scroller version. This game is inhumanely difficult. You'll have 2-3 guys attacking you at once. While one is shooting with 100% marksman ship just draining your life away the other(s) will be kicking and punching you and knocking you down. So your getting both beat and shot to death. Sounds like it would be rare but it isn't. This happens 100% of the time when you have one armed and one unarmed opponent mix. Each armed gooned you come across is almost like a mini boss. Your guns will barely phase them while they're guns hit every mark and will kill you even if you jump and run around or try to see cover.  Very poor game mechanics, and pretty inconsistent game play. The music is mundane and the artwork switches from fantastic to what is this supposed to be. Might not matter but in an "anime" game what's the reason for having several different artist with multiple renderings of the same character that look different in each one? Sounds like I'm being harsh but I just expected the in game art to look as good as the front cover and the opening scene. Instead it goes from Madhouse to Crayola crayon.	-1
Before Bungie made Halo (the most overrated game of all time, aside from Grand Theft Auto: Vice City), they proved that they most definitely were NOT the "greatest developers of all time" (as any ignorant XBOX fanboy will tell you) with this little-known blunder of a Third-person-shooter/fighter. Little known for a good reason, it seems.  This is one of the most aggravating games I've played in a long time. Not the "good" type of aggravating that you get from playing a game like Contra, where it's fun as hell, even if you die (and which results in that ultimate feeling of "awesome" when you finally DO beat it). Oni is the type of aggravating where 75% of the frustration and difficulty comes from the game itself, not because you aren't good at it.  Games like Oni are why I have very little respect for most American developers. "Hey guys, I have an idea! Let's forget about making a game that's actually FUN, Let's concentrate instead on making a game as realistic as possible. SO realistic in fact, that it greatly hinders the gameplay, and defeats the main purpose of playing a video game! Oh sure, some people may say it's boring, but who cares? They'll be too blown away by the fact that the game is just like real life!"  That forumla does not work at all in making a good game. Let's list the reasons why:  -The movement controls are designed to be like a first person shooter, with the left stick for movement, and the right stick for turning. That would be cool if this was a first person shooter. But in a third person game with much faster action (not to mention jumping and fighting game moves too), this just becomes ridiculous. People with less than 4 hands will find this game's controls poorly designed and nearly impossible to master.  -You can only carry one weapon at a time. How lame is that? Some may say this makes it more strategic, but take a look at Half-Life: You can carry as many weapons as you want, and it's still full of strategy.  -Hypo Sprays, the game's way of recovering your health, don't have an immediate effect. Instead of having your health meter instantly rise to full, it sloooooooooowly works it's way up to the top of the meter. If you get attacked while you're recovering, you've lost it all. Bye bye.  -There's no block button. Blocking attacks supposedly occurs when you face the enemy and don't press anything, but 9 out of 10 times, this won't save your ass.  -The game goes WAAAAAY overboard with weapon limitations. The Mecury Bow, for instance, has a 5 second recharge time and fires a whopping...2 rounds before it's out of ammo. Even though it kills most enemies in one hit, it still isn't enough to justify  something like that.  -You can only jump from about 10 feet off the ground before you take damage from falling. Once again, this is just going way overboard.  -You have to press a button to pick up items on the ground instead of just walking into the item and getting it. Need I say more?  -There's a HUGE gun in the game which one of the bosses weilds. Once you beat him, you can use this weapon for yourself. The problem is, you (literally!) can only run about 1 mile an hour while you're wielding this thing. It makes getting from one end of a hall to the other feel like a drive across the country.  There are some good things about Oni, like the good voice acting, the stylish cel-shaded graphics, and the comic book feel of the game, but it's overshadowed by all the horribly annoying gameplay flaws. Not worth it.	-1
In Resident Evil: Survivor, you play an amnesia stricken man wandering around a zombie infested town looking for clues to his past.  The first thing you'll notice about the game is it's first person perspective and that the game was clearly meant to use a light gun prepheral but does not (yet it's Japanese counterpart does).  That major drawback, combined with the choppy animation, muddy sound, poor controls, and near none replayability, make Resident Evil: Survivor one big disappointment of a game.  It's worth playing if your a longtime fan of the Resident Evil series, but don't expect much out of it other than an intriguing side story to the saga.  Capcom has once again made another first person light gun aimed Resident Evil game called Resident Evil: Dead Aim for the PS2, and that game is quite an improvement over this piece of crud.	-1
If you like Resident Evil, or First Person Shooters, this is not the game for you. This one fails horribly on both fronts. There is no look around feature essential to any FPS, so you can be standing right in front of something, and not be able to see it because you can't look down! Not to mention the fact that the plot is weak, and has nothing to do with the continuity of the other games. Steer clear of this one at all costs.	-1
The previews looked so cool. Get this, you need a TUTORIAL TO WALK. Yes, walking is a pain. WHenever you go sideways you actually strafe sideways, it is really inconvienient. The controls are terrible. You will see what I mean when you get to the first part of the training. You have to run around a room in an extremely short time. I had to do it like 8 times. Basically to beat it I walked straight, strafed left, then went backwards, and narrowly got it. Then the combos, they are so difficult to pull off. I honestly feel that the creators were trying to make it as hard as possible to lash out against the society or something. The backgrounds are terrible. I rented this game for one day and was fed up with it after 5 minutes of the first level. You honestly are going to see alot of boxes, in some of the most uninspired and retarted rooms ever. One room was a square. O thats right, they are all squares, with 2 or 3 boxes of course. Can't forget those boxes. The guns are the worst actually. When you shoot 6 bullets with a gun, mabye 5, your girl looks at the roof. She cannot hold a gun straight. The target practice is basically 3 targets going directly upward. I mean seriously, this chick is an operative, and the recoil on her gun actually has her looking towards the roof in 6 shots or less. O but wait, lets say she walks while she shoots, now magically her gun has no recoil and she is fine. So whenever you want to shoot anything and actually hit it with 2 shots or more, you have to move around. Want to know something else? The guns are stupid. The combos are hard to pull off, and worthless. I could care less about snapping that guy, I only have 2 arms. Jeez, it's like memorizing the dictionary, then repeating it word for word with the same exact tone and depth that you memorized it with. The game is terrible. Spend no money on it. Rockstar must of been payed to stop making this game, because I never see it anywhere, and that is a GOOD thing.	-1
This is the worst PS2 game I have ever played.  Boring, repetitive backgrounds, uninteresting weapons and characters, awkward control scheme, all on one disk.  I bought this game used a while ago for $12.00 and I still feel ripped off.  Did I mention the graphics? This game was released close to the time of the PS2 launch, and it shows.  There are also some serious clipping issues.  Simply put: Oni isn't worth your time.	-1
