Very tasty cookie. I always eat this cookie when I am hungry. It has a lot of fiber and pretty healthy	1
These are tasty! They remind me of a homemade chocolate oatmeal almond cookie (softer side) and not a crunchy overly sweet sugar bomb. I would buy these again. Thanks Kashi for making delicious whole grain foods!	1
I really liked everything about these - the flavor, the texture, the size. Used them for cheese and crackers, a cheese spread, and ate them plain as a snack. Will definitely buy more of these.	1
Delicious little things	1
Excellent texture, enough chocolate flavor and a satisfying crunch. Only thing holding it back from five stars is you can still taste the "healthy" grains, so it doesn't necessarily feel like a treat.	1
I love these!! They are truly delicious and very healthy for a snack!! Thank you!!	1
Crispy... but the product falls apart when eating it.	1
Surprisingly are good. Only problem I have is that they are two to a package. In my book, that is one bar, they are thin as well.	1
These are fire	1
We like the flavor and consistency of these.	1
These were delicious	1
My family is trying to use more natural or organic products.  This product helps us do that.  The bars are a little dry.  Make sure you have an organic drink or water handy.	1
My husband really likes the texture and flavor of these bars for a snack. He packs them as dessert with his lunch sometimes. Home run!	1
Better than expected but still not as good as nature valley or something similar.  I suppose that is because it is healthier than other brands though.  Very crunchy, yet still pretty delicious.	1
This is a really good breakfast bar (that's when I usually eat them anyway), will be ordering more.	1
Tasty	1
Hooked on these. Had never tried Kashi granola bars before & now, well, they are delicious. Not loaded with sugar. What surprised me is that Kashi is a Kellogg's Company.	1
Yummy and a great appetite satisfier for those hunger attacks while at work.	1
My husband and I are addicted to these.  They are far superior to the chewy versions.  Excellent, Healthy snack :)  I Love them!	1
Nice nutty flavor but don't really notice the chocolate, tiny chips	1
Tasted great to me	1
These are a very delicious snack and/or quick breakfast item when you are on the go. It comes in a pack of 10 which is very great for the price. I purchased this with my amazon prime pantry which I love because I can fill up a box with reasonably priced items and have it delivered to me in a heartbeat!  This is a nice crunchy chocolate chip, granola and seed bar. It tastes very great and is a nice cheat snack because it still has ingredients that are very helpful for your body but also contains yummy chocolate chips!  If you are looking for a yummy quick snack that is still on the healthier side, these are the perfect ones!	1
I love this. It tastes great and I always bring a pack with me on the road!	1
Great tasting cereal bar. love it	1
Great quick snack	1
Wonderful granola bars! A great snack	1
My kids LOVE these, and I am thrilled that they have some healthy ingredients in them!	1
terrific snack bars on the run	1
Shocked! I was not very hopeful to be honest when I opened my first one. Ive had a few other Kashi bars that were sub-par, and this one felt as dry as a bone and very light. So, I was expecting something akin to drywall. However, even though it is unashamedly one of the driest bars Ive ever tasted, it actually worked for me. The trick, perhaps, is to think of it as more of a biscuit than a bar  it reminds me of the Garibaldi biscuit  its dry, crispy and contains something to give it a little texture/chew (chocolate chips in this case). They weren't difficult to eat (even without a drink) even though they are so dry. These lightweight bars (180 cal in a 40 g pack) could be a good option for trekking. With a 9:1 carbs to protein (27 g carbs, 9 g sugars, 3 g protein) they are a little heavier on carbs, but also contain a lot of fiber (13% DV), low sodium, and a good fat balance. They are vegan-friendly, according to the Kashi website.  Be warned though, that the box says 10 bars, but there are 5 wrapped packs inside. I would never claim this to be equivalent to 10 granola bars. Each pack of 2 bars is equivalent to a regular bar, so its really five total. The first time I bit into it I didn't realize that its actually two bars (biscuits really  they are very thin) lying on top of each other. You could eat them as one or separate them.  Besides the 4/5 gold stars for quality and price I think they deserve 3/5 green stars for social and environmental impact. The ingredients are not organic and the cacao is not Fair Trade certified. Boo! I appreciate that they use expeller-pressed canola oil instead of the all-too-common palm oil. To look at overall social and environmental responsibility of Kashi, you have to look at their parent company, Kelloggs. There are some inconsistencies between Kashi and their giant parent, for example Kashi have a label on their bars proudly stating non-GMO project verified, while on the other hand Kelloggs donated millions to campaigns to block labeling of GMO foods. Kelloggs are doing a little better than some of the other huge multinational food producers, but they are lagging behind some of the more responsible food bar companies, like Clif Bar.  You can get their 2014 Corporate Responsibility Report on their website. They are doing quite well on responsible packaging, diverting waste from landfill, water use, and worker diversity. For example, their numbers on waste generation and water consumption were a little better than those from HAIN (known for their natural food lines). However, they are haven't made much progress so far this decade on reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. They have a target of 2020 for responsible sourcing of ingredients from rice and corn to cacao and berries. They also have a collaborative system (Sedex, the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange) for making sure suppliers are in compliance.  They work with farmers to increase sustainability (e.g., reduced water and fertilizer inputs) and also have programs to empower smallholders and women farmers.	1
Bought these for my son, who is too picky to even try them, so I ended up eating the entire box. They're surpisingly good. The picture makes them look thicker than they are - they're pretty thin, but you get two in each package. Although the chocolate chips are really small, there's a lot of them, so these end up being a lot tastier than you'd expect for something that focuses on being "granola and seed".	1
I wish they were a bit more gingery, but they are amazing. I could eat the whole box in one sitting. They pair well will tea, or Mountain Dew, or anything. The lemon cream is so delicious.	1
I have loved these for many years and was glad to see them available on Prime Pantry.  The pantry is a boon for elderly people of whom I am one and also I am disabled.  This is one group of products which I do not have to rely on someone to purchase and deliver for me.  It preserves my independence and gives me a feeling of self sufficiency.  Back to the cookies, I love the flavors, the ginger and lemon are quite complementary and the crisp cookie with the creamy filling makes a yummy and satisfying snack.  Alas, the box is so small.  Probably a good thing as I will eat them quickly no matter the amount.  Hmmmm maybe next time several boxes.	1
These are great cookies.  The lemon and gingersnap really compliment each other.	1
TASTED VERY EXPIRED	-1
Tasty snack	1
This is the worst Skinny  Pop I have had. In Pantry it is listed as White Cheddar bag it's self says white cheddar non- dairy flavor. Nothing artificial. Huh?  Ingredients: popcorn, sunflower oil, natural non-dairy cheddar flavors, Natural flavors, Rice flour, Lactic Acid, and Salt.  Result: I don't know what it is I am tasting when I tried to eat it but, I know this it doesn't remind me of any cheddar cheese,, even the Vegan cheeses taste better than this. Had a few people try it we all say the same thing "That's a odd flavor." Ended up throwing it out.	-1
I am a popcorn addict (scary, I use swype and my first attempt made me sound like another type of addict lol). In my attempt to lose weight and eat healthier, I had to cut out my microwave popcorn drenched with butter and salt. Since I didn't want to fully deprive myself, I eat this as my snack and it's perfect! It's crunchy and tasty and meets my taste bud needs! Well popped--not many kernels either!	1
Really good.	1
This popcorn is delicious! I love the white cheddar flavoring!	1
Good!  I really liked it.  But where I'm coming from, might be why.  I am on month3 of "less sodium, less fat, less sugar..."  I seem to need much less salt on my food than before, I hear that is normal - that your palette adjusts.  I really thought this was super salty, which I enjoyed, and it's pretty darn healthy.  My friend; however, thought it lacked salt - he's not on any healthy binge.  So maybe that is why there is such a difference in reviews, it is what you are used to.	1
very good and delicious  reasonable priced too	1
A healthy snack that tastes unhealthy.  This popcorn is so good and a serving size is 3 cups!	1
Arguably the greatest packaged popcorn in the universe.	1
Pretty good stuff.  Mild Cheese flavor and not tons of the hulls.  Not cheesy like other brands, but it satisfies the craving.	1
It's a healthy snack and I very yummy too!!	1
Great skinny popcorn with low calories	1
A great diet snack!	1
Nice quick snack that is healthy for kids and adults! Really good flavor, not a lot of the kernels floating around or the hulls.	1
More calories than I wanted but it is a great snack.  I use it for lunch too.	1
Really decent popcorn for a low-calorie snack.  Only 150 calories for the bag.  Granted, it doesn't have a lot of taste but it is low in sodium and fats.	1
Love this brand! Popcorn is not overly salty and it is healthier. (No GMO's / Artificial Ingredients or Colors)	1
THE BEST TASTING HEALTHY POP CORN	1
Tasty	1
good	1
20 somethings love it.	1
Not as good as the plain popcorn.  But we did eat it.	1
Tastes good, just not enough difference from the basic skinnypop to warrant the extra calories really.	1
I was very  disappointed that Skinny Pop is resorting to semantics when it comes to this "Naturally sweet" popcorn.  It is in truth a naturally  "sweetened" product. As they add in natural cane sugar to the product. Anyone could add the sugar to their own popcorn for less. I am not really impressed with the flavor either, it is hit or miss. Sometimes sweet, salty, or just popcorn. So I am given it two stars and I would not really feel right recommending this product because it's more a marketing ploy.	-1
Bags are smaller than expected	1
One of my family's favorite, healthy snacks. I buy a lot of this brand for school lunches, vacations and when kids entertain friends. Like the sizing options, don't like how hard the packages are to open. Will continue to buy for years to come.	1
no flavor, prefer the white cheddar	-1
Best popcorn available. The pepper adds zing and the popcorn is not wildly oversalted.	1
This popcorn is totally addictive! The cheese flavor is the best in my opinion : )	1
OMGOSH these taste great.	1
I had never thought of using Black pepper as a popcorn topping , this sounded very interesting to me. I absolutely love it. It is now my favorite way to eat popcorn now. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a zesty opposed to hot.  Ingredients popcorn, sunflower oil, salt , pepper. Major allergen and additives free.	1
My favorite popcorn!	1
Delicious!!	1
It's hard not to eat the whole bag in one sitting. I wlll order again and again!	1
Really great...who knew pepper on popcorn tasted so great...especially with so few calories	1
Always like this product a good natural clean feel..	1
Tastes good but it has fluoride.  I don't understand why any toothpaste that is claiming to be healthy would contain fluoride. Will not purchase again. It is really my fault for not reading the description thoroughly.	-1
I truly like this toothpaste. It leaves my mouth and teeth feeling exceptionally fresh and clean.i smell less concerned about plaque and gingivitis since I started using this. It does a great job in regard to leaving me with fresh breath and smooth clean teeth and is non-gritty.	1
I love this toothpaste!	1
Tastes good and son loves it.	1
My granddaughter likes and uses it - that is all I need.  Thanks.	1
Grandkids love it!	1
This smells and tastes nice, but it is very runny. I bought it for my 3 yr old and after a couple days of use I found drips all over my bathroom. It literally drips out as soon as the cap is open. If you can handle that you'll love it. If you have an all too independent 3 yr old as I do, beware of the mess that comes with.	-1
This is great to mix in with lotions to give them extra hydration. This is amazing for those extra dry areas of your body and really hydrates any area for a long time. This will be on hand at all times now !	1
Love the smell. Spreads easily. Fantastic. Will buy again	1
wife loves it	1
This is the best oil! I use it on my face every-night and my skin has never been better. It has less noticeable wrinkles, less acne and scars are fading.	1
Just purchased this oil to use for scar massage on my son from a recent surgery.  The oil smells lovely and is very smooth. It absorbed well into his skin and did not leave a sticky residue. I like that the ingredients are natural and that it's a usa made product.	1
Great for cuts, scrapes etc	1
Very good taste and ease of use.	1
Came out like a rubber brick.	-1
Glutton Free Warning.  Unfortunately this item came up on Amazon search as Glutton Free.  This is not the case at all.  Only after baking a birthday cake did we realize this was not going to work.  I did give the cake away and was told it was delicious, however Amazon search algorithm is doing a potently good product a bad service.	-1
As ordered, as expected	1
Really good cake mix. Tastes a little different from traditional cake mixes but that could be caused by a pallet contaminated by too much processed food. ;-) We'll buy more.	1
Simple recipe to follow, great outcome	1
outstanding cake mix	1
I love that the organic crowd is getting that not all of us who don't want the pesticides in our food are health purists. Give us cake and let us eat it too! Yes!	1
I don't do well with artificial vanilla which is in almost everything. This cake mix comes out more like chocolate bread. I even tried to make it moister and fluffier by adding a little leavening and oil. No such luck.  So with 3 boxes and a lot of tries I would say I like that it has nothing artificial. But it isn't going to win you any prizes taste wise against Pillsbury. And it could be much darker.	1
best organic honey grahams around!	1
yummy	1
I love Annie's products and will order them every chance I get since they don't sell the brand in any of my stores. I love these grahams. The honey flavor is light and flavorful and serve as a perfect coffee cookie. The sweetness is delicate and not overbearing. The only issue I have is similar to that of the cheddar crackers: The grahams leave a weird film on the fingers after handling. This is something that needs addressed because it makes eating the crackers sloppy. I've had stains on my table clothes after pouring a few too. The flavor is great, the mess is not!	1
I can only assume the other reviewers never tasted these because these are, by far, the most disgusting crackers I have ever eaten in my life. They taste like they have something caustic in them. I ate one and was all, "OMG, these are disgusting" and my husband tried one (thinking perhaps my tastebuds were off) but no, they were so vile. They had a strong metallic taste to him, and to me, they tasted like the smell of bug spray.  It took hours to get the taste out of our mouths.	-1
Great snack crackers from a trusted company!	1
Was disappointed in this flavor.  I could not detect a flavoring of pear and really don't care for this Bai5 flavor.  My adult son did not like it either.  Will not buy again.	-1
My favorite	1
great taste.	1
I love all the bai5 drinks Pear and Coconut are my particular favorites.	1
I can't get enough of this stuff. I'm drinking a bottle right now.	1
Strong flavor which is good, but not everyone will enjoy it. Lemon flavored tea with antioxidants. Sweet but yet sour/bitter at the same time. Best served chilled/cold.  HINT Caution -- there is an extreme price fluctuation on this 6 pack   RECOMMEND	1
Delicious and great alternative to soda pop.	1
Love em all	1
Delicious and love how they are only 5 calories!	1
Didn't really care for the taste	-1
Another Bai5 water flavor I cannot find locally.  The is one of my favorites as well.  I like almost all the Bai5 water flavors and usually drink one daily.	1
taste good	1
This is one of my most favorite flavors from Bai	1
kid & wife love these	1
This stuff is so good!!!  It's a bit pricey at over $2 a bottle. But if you like a clean crisp taste of coconut then you'll love these.	1
I haven't had a regular Bai flavor I didn't like. (The "bubbles" drinks are atrocious.) But this is my favorite. The bitter/sweet balance is perfect!	1
Excellent seller experience  great product	1
my favorite flavoe, it does keep you hydrated and tastes great	1
excellent drink. awesome when cold, really cold.	1
Hubby and I love this drink, especially in the hot summer months.  Not to sweet and very satisfying.	1
GREAT PRODUCT AAAAAAAAAA++++++++++	1
A bit more tart than the Vitamin Water Dragon fruit.  I don't know how anyone is saying it's too sweet.  Only thing I don't like is that it has caffeine.	1
Not bad.  Coconut is better	1
Not for me.  Cloyingly sweet	-1
I love these. I try not to drink my calories or too much sugar, and yet this has a lot of flavor.	1
love this stuff	1
love these products.	1
Good flavor	1
another great flavor when really cold.	1
LOVE THIS STUFF!!!  I've tried all the flavors but the Limu Lemon is my favorite.  It's refreshing and not too sweet.  You will become addicted that's how good it is!  Enjoy!	1
Great taste	1
This is my husbands favorite flavor of all the bai water choices.	1
Not my favorite flavor but was as described.	1
Was hoping this would be a refreshing natural drink but I was disappointed with the taste. Tasted like lemon plastic to me.	-1
better than soda	1
excellent beverage.	1
I love Bai waters, but I HATED this flavor.	-1
Best ever!	1
Very good, I think I have now ordered about 3 times. Will order again.	1
This is another one of the Bai5 flavored waters I cannot find locally.  I also save buying through Amazon Pantry versus just ordering a 12-pack through Amazon.  I like my water with lemon wedges so this Limu Lemon is another favorite of mine in the Bai5 waters - not too lemony but just right.	1
This granola is the best!  Dark chocolate and shredded coconut goes very well together.	1
this granola mix is deliicious!	1
Great Purchase!!!	1
Didn't love Love Crunch.  It was just OK.  I have tasted much better.	-1
Very tasty!  Never was much for chocolate cereal, but this is very high quality with just the right balance of flavors.	1
love it	1
Delicious, exactly what I was looking for.	1
Love, love this cereal. Very delicious but high in calories. Can only have a small portion. Seems very nutricious. Also, it is very expensive which will discourage me from ordering.	1
my favorite cereal, def for any coconut lovers!	1
Very good!!!!	1
These are so good they are ridiculously addicting, and i'm not the only one, my kids are always asking to have this for their breakfast to!	1
bueno	1
Very good!	1
Love this granola, and love that Nature's Path products actually are made from natural ingredients. I've found that it's easier to stick "natural" on a label, even if I don't recognize most of the additives listed as ingredients. This one is delicious. A little goes a long way, however, so I add it to a blander cereal like Cheerios sometimes. Otherwise, I like it right out of the box. Yummy.	1
Really great granola. It is a bit pricey, but worth it. The coconut taste is there and if you like coconut you will love this granola. The coconut taste is not overwhelming and the granola is very healthy and organic. I will definitely be getting this again. The box is heavy because it is packed with so many good ingredients.  Update: I ordered two more boxes because I love this granola!!	1
Chia seeds, granola, & coconut chips are highly healthy additives to your diet, if you're trying to eat unrefined/non-heavily-processed foods! Organic cereal with these ingredients has less carbs, less salt, less sugar, which are all good things for those trying to eat healthy! The cereal tastes absolutely wonderful!	1
This cereal is swank and the awesome companion cereal to Gorilla Munch. My son and I tear this stuff up.	1
Good value, good flavor and lots of raisins	1
We were surprised to find that we liked the plain flakes better than these with raisins. Maybe the raisins were a little more dried than in conventional raisin bran cereals? Anyway, still tasty, but I'd say buy the flakes alone and add your own organic raisins.	1
This tastes really good. I have it with soy milk. The ingredients are very healthy and keep you regular.	1
My favorite gluten free cereal!	1
everything is a bit dry but I let it soak a bit and it's good to go	1
My husband is addicted to this stuff. Full of raisins and lots of flavor without all the unnatural stuff.	1
These work like a charm--just remember to check the expiration date when they arrive and send them back if it's too close to your purchase date.	1
my spouses uses beano so she does not get gas.  I am glad she does because it reduces the awful farts.	1
Works well at keeping gas at bay. Love the fact that it's a natural supplement.	1
Alway works great. Fabulous "invention!"	1
Eating a lot of gas producing veggies for healthy eating does have a side effect.  These are really good for preventing the gas.	1
It works.	1
My doctor recommended this to chew one before a meal to prevent indigestion as a difficulty I did not have previously but now find I need to prevent with hernias.	1
Great product for gassy foods.  Works.	1
Good product. Good transaction.	1
I got this for hair growth.  I was losing hair and this really works.  Much better than Rogaine.  I noticed a change with hair growth within weeks of using this.	1
it does a good job on hair,nails	1
AAA	1
Thank you	1
I needed this to help my hair. It's too early to tell if it is working, but the product itself is just like the same bottle at the health food store. The price was good and I was glad to be able to order it on line.	1
I think these broke my face out, because of too much Biotin in the capsule. The milligrams are too high for me.	-1
Enjoy a vitamin that does what is advertised	1
I find this supplement really does help my hair and nails so I take it on a daily basis. Super small easy to take pill.	1
It's hard to get proper amount of this with regular diet, and it is important for hair, skin and nails.  I notice an improvement when I take it regularly, most multivitamins do not include it.	1
(:	1
My usual brsnd. They work. I still have my hair!!!	1
A friend who loss her hair from cancer treatment regrew her hair quickly.  I asked how?  She told me Biotin on a regular basis.  I was loosing hair and had NO success in growing my nails.  I now get repeated compliments on my nails and am often asked if they are 'real'.  They are and are very strong.  I also stopped the hair loss and it started growing fast.  I think you will too, just use it every day, in fact I take 2 a day.	1
This is a supplement I have used for at least ten years because since childhood my nails easily split and I understood it might help -- and, it seemed to improve their strength. I've noticed when I don't take it for any length of time I start to have problems with splitting nails, so I plan to continue its use. but am well aware the improvement in my nails may be related to something else, and reactions will vary for each individual. I have not noticed any change in hair or skin. I am familiar with this brand although it is not one I have used for this particular supplement, but after taking the very tiny gel tabs for a couple of weeks, I have experienced no adverse reactions.	1
I am a post menopausal woman, that lost my hair (on my head) during the process.  I tried the biotin shampoo and it was not enough, but two years ago, I started taking these supplements ....and it is a miracle.  My hair has grown back in and then some, it is thicker and fuller.  But the test is no hair in the drain after a shampoo.	1
Haven't noticed any difference from other brands but highly recommend Biotin. Nails have never been stronger or have grown as fast!	1
I actually like the taste of this water and prefer it over other brands.  It is cheap and is exactly what I need.	1
I love this water. Tastes almost as good as fiji without the fiji price. Will definitely buy again. Clean, crisp and refreshing taste.	1
Nice taste, refreshing.	1
work great as always.	1
I will buy these again.	1
I accidentally purchased these not realizing that they were the garbage bags with the flaps instead of the draw string. I am impressed at how they stay on the garbage can and they are definitely capable of holding more and I will start with the flex feature.	1
Wish I had not gotten these. They rip so easy.	-1
great quality	1
ForceFlex stretch a long way. Great bags.	1
Thank you.	1
great	1
Tough, no ripping or tearing. Holds a lot.	1
Excellent buy	1
They don't have a super strong scent, and my trash can still smells.	-1
great	1
I love using these. I can fill the bags to the top with trash and don't have to worry about it ripping. Love Glad!!!!!	1
smell great	1
These are my favorite garbage bags. I love that they are combined with the Febreze scents so that we don't get that stinky garbage smell. And they are much cheaper on amazon in bulk than at any grocery store I've been to.	1
These bags are great - sure cut down on the odors.	1
I really love neo w/pain oinment	1
a must have	1
One of the best Disinfecting products out there and takes away a bit of the pain too. A little oily, so I like the cream better.	1
It always does the best!	1
The pain relief ingredient actually does relieve pain, and antibiotic ointment ingredient helps heal quickly.	1
Quickly clears up allergy spots	1
Awesome product!	1
Thanks	1
good	1
This an excellent product to put minor wounds to help them heal faster.	1
Keep multiple tubes on hand at any given time.  Plus the price was reduced so there's the reason for the order.	1
excellent product	1
best stuff	1
Good to have around	1
No complaints! Bought for my purse. Haven't had to use it yet.	1
Good!	1
Always works!	1
Good product	1
Item was as described and fast shipping too.	1
Helps me snooze better	1
Been using phenylephrine HCL for years. Still can't pronounce it, but that doesn't take away from how well it works. It clears my sinuses quickly with just one dose, and the effects last for a full day (or, if it's really bad, nearly a full day). Also, I've not had any side effects of note using this. On occasion I'll get dry mouth, but it's not anything significant.  I like that it does not include any other meds, such as acetaminophen. If I have pain I can always take some pain meds with it, but much of the time just the phenylephrine does the trick.  The price on Amazon for this brand is much less than the name brands, and even a bit less than the house brand at Walmart.	1
So helpful this time of year	1
They seem to work as well as the local generic	1
works	1
Excellent	1
Couldn't beat the price!	1
Works very well. Same as name brand.	1
They work.	1
Works well	1
Hubby has to take 30mg from a "only at Pharmacy" brand.  But, when his symptoms are less severe, these work just fine & cost is  far better.	1
I ordered 10 boxes and only recieved 1 in the box I recieved. ALSO They deducted the total amount from my card.	-1
When all else fails. Also great for kids they are tiny.	1
As I moved to the US I heard that the main pain reliever people use here is called Advil. After a quick search I found out that it is the same ibuprofen that we use in Europe, just more expensive and has a brand name.  Works well, but the price is higher then it is supposed to be.	1
It does what it is supposed to do.....help alleviate pain and helps me fall asleep.	1
Works as advertised.	1
Husband uses	1
Exactly what we wanted!!	1
Definitely helps me sleep when I have a back ache	1
I've used this for years and it really works - and it works fast. I would definitely recommend it to others with pain at night	1
Thanks	1
This product helped me get a good nights sleep during a horrible back ache period and I awoke without grogginess.  It also helped me to stay asleep through the night.	1
good item	1
Works well for me!!!	1
These are a great life savor at night to help with all my aches and pains, as well as the difficulty with sleeping. It works great	1
works	1
Good Job	1
good vitamins; good flavor; and reasonable price; nothing to right home about but nothing to complain about.	1
Our family swears by this product!	1
Excellent supplement to add Vitamin C to Airborne...Great gummy bear taste!!!!  A+++++	1
Great in Gummy Form!	1
Love the convenience of Amazon delivery for pantry products!  As a busy mom, this is huge!  Thank you amazon! I work a lot, and often am short on sleep...these keep me from getting sick when my whole house has the bug.	1
Package was received quickly, in tact, and with the same quality as those bought from the grocery store. I love the flavor, so was glad to see it available online. Thank you!	1
great taste	1
Big pill. I usually have to cut them up about 6 times. Not these Perfect chewable.	1
Seems to work.  So far have avoided the winter colds that are flying around.	1
It is expensive but it works well, I take two every day and work in an elementary school. I have rarely gotten sick during the past two years I have been taking these	1
As expected!	1
My hubby apparently has sensitive skin. The regular extra strong ones sometimes took off some skin and left a scab on his nose..eeek.  he was hesitant to try the sensitive skin extra strong ones as he didn't think they'd work as well. But, being sick of looking at a scab on his nose I bought some anyway. He approves! Says they work just as well and I haven't had to look at a scab on his nose since!	1
This is my favorite probiotic to take. They taste great and are on the sweet side so its kind of like a special treat! My daughter takes them daily and does not complain. It is a really good product that keeps her healthy and moving. I am very glad that i found these.	1
good tasting	1
Taste Great! Love that both kids and adults can take these.	1
like these they work and shipping was as agreed	1
I snore and use this on trips to help mitigate the sound. I always have this on trips.	1
Really work!	1
Taste good and seem to help.  If you don't finish them in a month they do start to get harder and chewier.	1
Works well	1
works well	1
These taste so good.	1
My whole family takes these daily. Since starting our BMs are all more regular and we are sick a lot less. We were all exposed to the stomach flu a few weeks ago and doubled our dosage and were able to avoid getting sick!  Such a great Probiotic!	1
I love the taste and i do hope it is not just sugar. I feel like it has worked. My stomach has felt better. I do have crohn's	1
AAA	1
I gave these to my kids - it really does work and it's a gummy so they don't complain	1
Great taste and way to get me to remember to take probiotics. I take so many supplements that I want one to be candy.	1
I used to have a spastic colon, not to be disgusting.  But these gummies have Totally eliminated that thorn in my side.  I love to take them of course--gummies--who could ask for more!!	1
These candy-like gummies do the trick with their digestive advantage. Thus the name. Easy to take, although some may find them a little too sweet tasting. Seems to take a few days to start feeling the probiotics working. Cannot definitively say that these are why I feel better, but until proven otherwise, I'll continue to take these.	1
If I can believe everything the label says, this is a good product.  Since I have no way of confirming that, all I can say is that it tastes good and I have high hopes it delivers as it says.  I haven't noticed anything since taking them, but who knows?	1
These arrived in a giant blob of gummy mess. Should have figured this would happen. Ill stick to walmart or target for now on	-1
Easy to get kids to take. My husband actually started taking these instead of the pills	1
As advertised	1
works very well and tastes good	1
These are a good alternative to my normal probiotics.  It is in gummie form versus a pill, so that makes it easy to give 4 stars.  However, I don't think this probiotic is as good as my usual, which is the main reason I give this 4 stars.	1
Delicious and works great!	1
Good price and packaging	1
Not sure how well they work, but they taste great...LOL.	1
Wonderful results	1
Glad we got these!  One less supplement to down.	1
Taste great seem to work as described	1
Take 2 everyday to help keep stomach inline and digestive system working.  One negative is too much sugar on the gummies.	1
My husband doesn't like swallowing pills so these gummies work for him.  This brand seems to have good levels of all the daily vitamins.	1
The vitamins require you take TWO per day to meet the recommended daily values. That was a letdown, also the gummies have the issue of sticking together at times requiring the unpleasant task of separating them by hand. Fair value, a bit disappointed that unlike the label, it is really two of these per day.	1
The gummies stick together. I would prefer the pills.	1
Not much to say about vitamins since they're all pretty much the same and really...who knows if they actually do anything. What I can tell you is these things are delicious. They're so good that you have to force yourself not to eat them like gummy bears.	1
Yes, these say to take two per day.  I knew this going in, so I'm not going to complain about it.  The truth is, I've never had such great-tasting vitamins before.  I've tried gummies before and they were okay, but these actually taste like candy.  No weird flavors or aftertaste.  That's the best thing about these.  Worked great for me and I didn't always take them every day, so that extended the time I had them.	1
Simple good product.	1
Super awesome!	1
Doctor prescribed	1
Excellent	1
Good low dose that doesn't upset your stomach	1
Good	1
using this on daily basis for inflammation prevention!	1
Good	1
I hate having to take multi vitamin pills so I just take these twice a day. They taste so good I actually look forward to taking these every day. My energy level has definitely gone up from taking these.	1
Convenient way for me to store my daily aspirin dose.	1
Good but cheaper from the pharmacy.	1
must take one a day.  Great product	1
as expected. high quality	1
Gets me thru the day.	1
I take a daily low dose aspirin for medical reasons. I like Bayer because they are coated. I bought these on Amazon because they were a good price and it is convenient.	1
I take one of these per day to keep from having a stroke	1
This is a great product, and the price and quantity make it a worthwhile purchase.  I rate it five stars.	1
I will continue to buy this product.  It is very reasonably priced and last a long time.	1
LOVE LOVE LOVE the small size of the gel-tab.	1
I can feel the difference	1
Essential for good health. One tablet a day is what you need.	1
thanks	1
Just what Dr ordered	1
ok	1
Nice	1
ok	1
Works well	1
Our Doctor recommended we take one low dose aspirin per day and we chose low dose Bayer. They are smooth, small and we felt they had a great reputation.	1
Product is as described.	1
Easy to take	1
I have bought 3  bottles of these, will definitely again. Great deal and quality.	1
Good stuff	1
OK	1
Great product	1
Works as expected	1
Good price for this product.	1
I take these around lunch and I'm good till bedtime with energy.	1
have nothing to say	-1
My usual brand. They work!!	1
ok	1
My Doctor recommends a daily dose for my blood pressure	1
Love them - always purchase these!	1
I use this every day by order of my doctor.  Good value.  One heart attack was more than enough.	1
Bayer is always a good product	1
good	1
I've been using this product for 30+ years to keep our  septic tank working well.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this product at a reasonable price	1
I will never use anything else. I have used Rid-x for 20 years and have never had any issues with our septic system. Don't use the cheap stuff - Buy Rid-x and your septic will thank you!	1
this product is great I have used it before I am pleased with it	1
great price	1
Perfect for my daily dose! My doctor told me I needed to take a low dose aspirin a day, and I've always trusted Bayer. Win-win!	1
I take one every day to ward off heart attacks and strokes.  You should to.	1
Perfect for the cost	1
Good product!	1
Been using it for years. Never had a problem with backups. Just like the tv says.	1
great product, pleased	1
Great deal on a 300 ct package for about $11.  As expected except this was the frustration free version - meaning - if you have small kids, this should be locked up.  The lid is an easily opened, screw off cap. Says it on the bottle, but don't recall seeing that on the site info.  Luckily, it didn't matter for us.  Otherwise, happy, it had an expiration date of over a year away.	1
Can't go wrong with Bayer! I usually resist bulk purchases, but being on the daily regimen as recommended by every doc I've had for the last 20 years--given my family medical history--constantly buying small bottles gets old after a while. I was buying generic small bottles, but this bulk bottle came out at about the same cost per pill. One less thing to go on the shopping list and no worries about running out/forgetting to buy.	1
Love the lid on these so much easier to open	1
Paying up for aspirin is like buying super-premium vodka. I won't be able to tell the difference, but at least I'll have the benefit of a premium placebo.	1
Product is as described - Very good	1
Happy	1
good	1
Does a great job but does take time	1
Worked fine	1
NICE TO HAVE ON HAND ALWAYS NEED THEM FOR SOMETHING OR OTHER	1
They arrived as promised & fresh. We go through batteries. These were fresh & nice batteries. Very happy w/ my purchase & will purchase again.	1
Good price will see how long they work.  Any problems and I will report back.	1
Good batteries at a good price.	1
Does work!	1
Great pricing for these. They last just as long as more common brands and at a better price.	1
So far I am happy with this purchase.  My kids go through AAA's like crazy and I had been buying the big brands thinking they'd last longer, but these are working out great I'd say they have lasted just as long if not longer than the other guys.	1
Amazing !	1
Good product.	1
Also great for tiny lines .	1
works great	1
Pretty good batteries for the price especially since we go through quite a few of them!	1
use them constantly with radios, games etc.  saves from going to store every other day	1
great product.  A+	1
It's 2016 and thse expire in 2025. Not a bad deal at all. They won't last a year since we use lots of 3A's.	1
Good value where frequent changes are needed - trail cams!	1
arrived on time and as described	1
OK, 48 batteries for $10...makes you wonder how good they are.  I have two small flashlights and a stick-on light that requires this size of batteries and it was breaking the bank to buy the two big other brands' heavy duty batteries.  These batteries have out performed the other batteries and what a deal on the price!	1
Good service and works great.	1
Trying these out, so far so good, see how long they last.	1
did not last very long in night light	-1
A crapton of crappy batteries at a good price. Perfect for remotes and gadgets around the house.	1
These batteries are a great deal!  I usually just buy batteries at the dollar store, but I find that they do not last too terribly long.  I bought this pack of batteries to power a label maker.  I am still on the original 4 batteries after obnoxiously labeling everything in my house.  I bought the big pack because I thought I would need more than one set, but I am glad that I did because the price cannot be beat!	1
yeah this stuff worx awesome takes two months tho	1
This product is very thin and if you use too much it will leave a film in your skin that you can peel off, so you only need a tiny bit! It takes a long time to start to see the scars fade but they will fade over time. If the scars are older then it will take longer but if you are committed to using it every day then it will work. I have used it for scars on my legs and arms as well as some acne scars on my face and they are still there. but they are fading away like Marty McFly	1
Good scar gel.	1
Love buying in quantity!	1
Arrived on time and looks exactly as described on the listing.	1
Do their job and a decent price	1
Great price	1
Just as described.  Great.  Would purchase from this vendor again.	1
What can I say, they're delicious and keep me from becoming giant.	1
Yummy	1
Review of Quest Protein Bars, the short version:  Pros: Tasty, for a protein bar Decent portion size Nice-sized pieces of chocolate in them Great for road trips! Wide range of flavors, if these aren't to your liking Don't upset my stomach  Cons: Cost Triggers munchies, but not as bad as a sugary snack would Texture is 'grainy'  The long version: I like these bars quite a bit. They have the typical 'protein bar' taste all of these bars do, but beyond that, they're one of the better brands. I like the bigger pieces of chocolate in them, and the fact that they come in different flavors. I do think the Double Chocolate are my favorite, though. Some bars (and sugar-free candies) upset my stomach due to the artificial sweetener; these don't. They're a good size for a protein bar, which aren't meant to fill a person up, but it's nice to get a little more product for the expense.  I especially like them for road trips, because eating them means I eat less fast food, avoiding the issues that come with that.  All protein bars are overpriced, and these are no different. My other complaints about the bars are the texture, which is oddly grainy. Last, they do seem to trigger the 'munchies' more than other bars, similar to how sugar-filled snacks will. If you have issues with snacking, it's something to keep in mind. (I only eat them when I'm away from home, without access to snacks.)  Overall, these are a good protein bar, that I will continue to purchase.	1
Having been diagnosed with adult onset diabetes I had to start looking for lower carbs and sugar free food.  Very hard to find in the stores so was very happy to see some great items on Amazon.  These brownies taste great.  I can't tell the difference between regular brownies and they don't spike my blood sugar.	1
Quite good for sugar free.  Easy to mix and bake.  Family enjoyed them.	1
I will not buy these again	-1
I added chopped walnuts to jazz them up a bit.	1
Item as described with prompt delivery	1
perfect ..	1
great!	1
I am a repeat customer of this product!!!  These brownies are AWESOME!!!  I love them.  Yummy if you add some walnuts..	1
I will start off by saying, I did not have any Quest bars before they were reformulated, so I can't compare to the past formulation.  I will also fully admit to having a terrible sweet tooth and wanting to stuff chocolate in my face all the time.  But, I am counting calories and looking to reduce my sugar intake, and I had heard good things about Quest bars (as well as having enjoyed the Quest bars I've tried in other flavors in the past few months).  Please note these have 180 calories instead of the 160 shown in the product images, due to the reformulation.  180 calories is still pretty good for a protein bar.  These are my favorite Quest bars.  By far.  I can see how some people would think they were too sweet, but I thought they were amazing.  So chocolatey.  They do have artificial sweeteners, but I am rather used to the flavor of artificial sweeteners at this point in my life, and I am not really noticing any sort of aftertaste (nor any digestive effects, but your mileage may vary).  I found the texture to be pretty good; there were some chocolate chunks but these were basically chewy and non-sticky like with other Quest bars.  I think the chocolate and peanut butter flavors of Quest bars are better, in general, than the fruity ones, though that may be personal preference.  One reason I am drawn to Quest bars is the high protein content (these have 20 grams).  I am eating at a calorie deficit to lose weight, and I am exercising a lot, and I want to minimize muscle loss.  I am a vegetarian so I can't get protein from meat (and I naturally tend to gravitate towards lower protein foods).  So I decided to supplement with bars like this.  I tried a bunch of different kinds, but decided I liked the balance of nutrients here best.  In addition to the protein, there are 13 grams of fiber and some fat, but not a ton.  There are a few minerals (calcium, iron, phosphorus, magnesium), which is nice.  Another thing I really like is that although this has 170 mg of sodium, it also has 140 mg of potassium, which will help to counterbalance the effects of the sodium to a degree.  (Note: these numbers differ somewhat from what you see in the product images.  The product images are the older formulation whereas the numbers I have listed here are taken off a bar in current packaging.)  Here are the current ingredients:  Protein Blend (Milk Protein Isolate, Whey Protein Isolate), Soluble Corn Fiber (Prebiotic Fiber), Almonds, Erythritol, Water, Unsweetened Chocolate, Cocoa (Processed with Alkali), Natural Flavors, Cocoa Butter, Palm Oil, Sea Salt, Calcium Carbonate, Steviol Glycosides (Stevia).  These are vegetarian but not vegan.  They do have dairy and tree nut (almond) ingredients, so watch out for that if you have any allergies.  They are also gluten free, if that is of concern to you.  If you have a sweet tooth but don't want all the sugar that comes with it, and if you like (milk) chocolate a lot, you will be happy with these.	1
great	1
Love these bars. 30 seconds in microwave..boom!  uses sugar alcohols...boom	1
Didn't realize you had to bake these in a water bath - too much trouble for a pan of brownies.	-1
In my opinion this is hands down the best pain reliever for aches and pains, swollen joints, etc. My daughter has used the child version for her kids since they were babies.	1
It's Advil alrighty!	1
It does the job	1
as expected	1
I take two and my headache is gone.	1
I use this for a lot of thibgs! Never had any issues or side effects! Works on pain and minor headaches!	1
Good	1
a	1
just fine	1
Product came as promised.	1
excellent price for a product that gets used a lot in my house. Will purchase again!	1
A great pain relief	1
would buy again	1
Everybody knows just how helpful and effective Advil is. I am writing this review to note that the price of this sized Advil on Amazon were heaps less expensive than at other stores like CVS or Target. This is an incredible deal that was irresistible.	1
Great product for relieving aches and pains.	1
Excellant	1
Was a lot more and bigger than I expected.	1
Advil, like the ads say, #1 recommended OTC pain med.	1
I'd been using generic Ibuprofen for years but picked up this Advil to help fill my Prime Pantry box.  I really do think that Advil is superior to the generics.  It seems to alleviate headaches and muscle aches more quickly.  I also prefer the shape and sweeter coating of the tablets.  They are much more palatable.	1
Arrived sooner than estimated and Advil is the Only thing that has ever worked for my migraines so 5 Stars! Not to mention the stores in the town I shop in stopped selling the 300 ct bottles and this is a Great value compared to the 200 ct they still sell.	1
Love it	1
perfect for bad hangovers	1
love this stuff	1
Does a great job!	1
Works great	1
k	1
make me go sleepytime	1
I have a terrible time getting to sleep.  Melatonin was recommended as a safe way to nod off.  These are great - I take one about 20 min before I want to get sleepy & it works every time.  I can feel myself getting drowsy & make my way to my bed (or just turn off the light if I'm there).  Unless something odd has occurred (major stressor), I sleep through until morning - which is usually (for me) 6-7 hours.  I wake up with ZERO hangover.  I had major insomnia - so this stuff is a gift to me AND I like that it is non-addictive!	1
Good value	1
For 3.99 it's a good deal and dosage.	1
Oxsee clean is one of the most versatile products on the market. This is a must have for your laundry room, kitchen and garage. I use this to remove stains, freshen and really clean work towels, and on all my whites. But Oxsee clean doesnt stop there in the kitchen I use this to clean my dishwasher, get stains out of linens,  I mix it with water to clean all of my pressure mats In the garage I mixed with water to clean the garage floor, to get stains out of all outward cushions, and to clean my pavers and concrete. It really is one of the most personal products on the market.	1
oxy works	1
This helps keep my laundry looking good.	1
My daughter takes these at times.  She says it helps a lot.	1
Helps you sleep at night. Great price and coupon too.	1
Every one is different and will react to this differently. For me it really knocked me out to the point that I was really tired the next day. I can suggest taking this much earlier in the day if you have nothing going on because it truly makes you fall asleep and stay asleep. Great for people with insomnia but I would experiment with when you take it so you aren't groggy the next day.	1
Works like a charm. I feel it within the hr.	1
Cant go wrong	1
i LOVE this stuff, takes stains out of everything and it's great to help strip my  cloth diapers	1
Great product.  Fast product.	1
Really like this product.  It does what is advertised. Will purchase again if the price stays down. if the price goes up too much, I will start buying it locally.	1
I love OXICLEAN!! I soak my kids stained clothes in it before washing and everything (for the most part) comes out. If it doesnt come out I just re-soak and that usually does the trick.	1
good price	1
Oxyclean is a great product.  My only issue is that it comes in a plastic bag which is not resealable.  No tote either.	1
great stuff	1
:)	1
Makes you feel energetic. I can tell when I've missed one.	1
Very practical way to take turmeric.	1
I get Tumeric (curcumic) for my mother, who has just had knee surgery. Of course she has pain meds for the time being, but Tumeric aids in helping to reduce inflammation. It also helps with her osteoarthritis, high cholesterol and upset stomach, to name only a few things it is beneficial for. We are really getting a lot of bang for our buck, so to speak.	1
I got it for pain, but guess what? IT BURNS FAT!! I have lost about 20 lbs since I started taking it!!	1
OxiClean is a good product.  Requires soaking but that is OK for me.  Some might not have the time.	1
Good product.	1
Oxiclean is my life saver. Time and time again it saves my laundry from awful stains. I've also used it around the house to remove tough stains and it helps to return my bathtub to its sparkling white state after I have rinsed out my newly dyed fire engine red hair. Oxiclean is a staple in our house.	1
Great whitener.	1
Like so many others, weve come to reply on the dependable cleaning boost OxiClean gives to our wash and pre-wash soaks. What a great product!	1
A great product and it does get your clothes quite clean.	1
Love this,really works well	1
I love Oxi-Clean and add it to most of my loads of laundry, along with either Arm & Hammer or Oxi-Clean detergent.  It is great for brightening and adding extra cleaning power.  I will have to use some of the additional features but it's a great addition to make your laundry feel even cleaner!  I really like this package as I have a clear gladware-type container that I keep it in on the laundry room shelf.	1
A great alternative since phosphate detergents are no longer made, but I'd go back to buying phosphates over anything if they still made it.	1
I have felt so much better since i started this vitiman.	1
I've read that turmeric fights against cancer so hopefully it does!  The only side effect I occasionally have is heartburn.	1
good price and is helping along with the glucosimine	1
great	1
Cleans well. NOT for colored clothes. Shipped promptly.	1
Huge box!!	1
Simply put, I cannot live without this product.  It goes in every load of wash and never fails to remove stains.  And the price for the size you get is incredible!	1
Good for arthritis even my dog loves these.  Has helped her at 12 years old with her hips.	1
Does what it's suppose to.	1
Just as expected for a decent price.	1
Arrived in good condition	1
Great product	1
Good product.  Have used Oxi Clean for years.  And will continue to use it for a long time.  Good seller.  Fast delivery.	1
Great product for most cleaning needs.	1
Doesn't have an overpowering perfume to it. i like this ( or other oxy powders) because it lets me cut back on using chlorine bleach.	1
Taken with a meal, this is helping keep my diabetes numbers lower.	1
Bought for pain management.  After 2 weeks can't notice much improvement.	1
CAN NOT DECIDE IF IT HELPS	1
Amazing	1
I love this stuff.  I don't need bleach anymore for my laundry because it cleans my whites and color cloths clean and dirt free.	1
Oxy clean is the best. This brand gets rid of stains and makes my clothes bright in the original color. I will always use Oxy because it's the best!!	1
We put this in all laundry loads as a booster. I also use it to scrub sinks, tile, and bathtubs with.	1
Got out old stains that had even been through the dryer. This stuff is truly amazing.	1
A laundry room must-have.  We frequently use this in lieu of detergent, particularly for times such as towels that may sit in the cabinet or closet for a while.  Detergent-washed items get a stale grease smell after storage.  Using OxiClean only keeps stored clothing cleaner and fresher smelling.  My clothes almost smell line-dried.	1
Doesn't really get all the stains out, but does okay with keeping my whites mostly white without having to use bleach. Bleach would actually turn some of my whites yellow. So this is the best alternative.	1
Use these on my dog to clean her up and they work great! Great quality, hold up well!	1
i  swear by this product forever as I don't like bleach  but it is  so  heavy so Prime grocery once again	1
Use regularly in laundry and many other applications!	1
Work good	1

Summary: Great baby wipes, they have never irritated my kids bottoms, no weird smells.  Use Case: Both my son (2.5 years old) and my daughter (6 months old) primarily use cloth diapers, when changing their diapers we like to use the least chemically products for changing our kids diapers.  The Good: - No weird smells come off of these baby wipes. - A full package fits into our diaper bags baby wipe holder. - The package re-seals itself easily. - My kids have never realized any irritation that we can attribute to the baby wipes, and compared to our friends who use the cheapest product that is always available they seem to be consistently realizing diaper rash issues.  The Bad: - I haven't found any issues with this product, they are competitively priced.  Other Thoughts: - I bring a couple of these along while primitively camping and have not realized any issues doing that, it keeps me feeling fresh and smelling decently.  Demographics: I am 29 years old, male, live in Minnesota USA. My son is 2.5 years old and my daughter is 6 months old.	1
does a great job!	1
wouldn't be without this product.  it works great on everything and fabrics don't fade out. Cleans my white tile floors better than any other cleaning product.  Does leave a bit of a fine white film on the tiles though. But the floor is not sticky at all, like it is with so many other products.	1
Good value	1
An essential to my household, I use it in all laundry loads, mopping, floor and carpet cleaning and as a stain remover. It is the very best solution for all sorts of cleaning and stain removing projects. I need the biggest one possible and love the scent.	1
Perfection!	1
love it	1
Love this stuff. Love the extra large size.	1
A scoop of Oxyclean clean and your laundry has your clothes smelling refreshed.  Nothing like showing up at work with stinky old clothes that hasn't been refreshed for you.  Even if you'd like to line dry your clothes, Oxyclean will still have them smelling nice.	1
Loved it.	1
I use this every day.	1
Two boys and a husband who works in a body shop equals OXI Clean.  I love the extra size as the price is better. This is really great stuff, use on all my whites, never have to bleach.	1
Good product as expected	1
Great product	1
They do the job, pleased with the effects....but definitely make a note they are large to swallow.	1
Smells and taste like fish	1
Arrived as scheduled.  Thanks!	1
I'm taking one of these a day per my doctor's instructions. After two weeks with this particular bottle of Nature Made fish oil, I am very pleased. The capsules are easy to swallow and I have no issues with any sort of fishy aftertaste or indigestion. My main reason for rating this five stars is because there are no unnecessary added ingredients - no sugar, flavors and most importantly no added soy making this one of the few brands that is safe for me to take.	1
Best price	1
GREAT PRODUCT	1
I like this product. It desolves well in the dishwasher not leaving any plastic to gum up the works. Cleans well too.	1
I find these really great for our hard (alkaline ) water.	1
:)	1
My fav dishwasher soap	1
On par with other detergent packs of the same level, not too expensive for the amount you get.	1
Good deal for the price but don't buy if you expect to get all your dishes clean in 1 load	-1
These packets of dishwasher gel do a fine job of asking my dishes and are very convenient to use. Nicely scented like orange blossoms too, a pleasant plus.	1
Terrific. Recommended by the manufacturer	1
Good product!	1
Work just fine as expected	1
I am not a big fan of this product. I have had to wash dishes by hand cause the dishes came our with either spots or food still stuck to the dishes. The other detergent I've used never caused me to do this. I'll be switching back to cascade for sure.	-1
These do not clean my dishes as well as the powder type cubes with the powerball in it.	-1
Candy pieces on top of the are hard, will not purchase again	-1
I do NOT recommend it. I took this for months until my primary care doctor told me that any vitamin with Magnesium Stearate does not get absorbed as much as it should. Hence, I wouldn't recommend it	-1
I picked these up for my granddaughter. They are overpriced for what they are, ten very small snacks that don't taste any better than the fruit shaped ones.	-1
We did not like the taste or texture of these.	-1
these are too sticky.	-1
no no no, no no no no.  Wow this stuff does NOT work for me!!  Firstly, if any powder drops anywhere (which we all know happens when using powder...), let's just say... well, it looks like you dropped a bunch of white powder everywhere.  Take that as you will.  Imagine not blending it all in and having some around your nose or something at work... WHO WANTS TO GET FIRED TODAY? jk. but srsly.  Secondly, every time I have applied it, it literally highlights any imperfection on my face.  I have this product to thank for showing me imperfections I was previously unaware of, so thanks for the confidence boost NOT  I'm actually confused after getting this product as to what exactly it is supposed to do.  It certainly didn't do anything I was hoping for, and I did read the description... #fail	-1
Love the product but the packaging is insanely difficult to open. Knives and razor to open. Very hazardous. Absolutely was frustrated by the whole thing. It ended up breaking and spilling all over in my attempt to open. Will not be buying it again	-1
causes breakouts...	-1
This may be the worst concealer I have ever tried. I'm 39 and admit that my dark circles are challenging. I don't expect any concealer to cover them perfectly. This stuff settles into lines I didn't even know I had! It makes my undereyes area, which is typically on the oily side, dry and flaky.  I am no stranger to concealers, and when my favorite was discontinued, I thought to try this based on great reviews. It actually makes my undereye area look worse! It is fine when first applied, but go peek in the mirror an hour later. It is bad.	-1
Poor quality	-1
Maybelline clearly slapped there name on this eyeshadow set, as I've seen the identical one sold with a cheaper brand name on it. The applicator is a joke, so you'll have to buy some brushes if you don't have any.	-1
Water had a strange taste	-1
I've tried this water (Aquafina) twice, and both times it gave me heartburn and diarrhea.  Could just be me.	-1
thought they were bigger :/ my bad	-1
Tough to open	-1
This brand doesn't taste that nasty, but it doesn't taste good either. It doesn't taste as clean as Dasani does. It has a metallic aftertaste as well.	-1
i hate this drink just like i hate pepsi perfect	-1
Tastes very much like cheap cherry flavored medicine mixed with cola.	-1
The taste wasn't bad, but made me feel very inflamed, never again. Pepsi and I have never been compatible	-1
no thanks, i don't like pepsi anymore	-1
i hate this company after the pepsi perfect mess	-1
did not like the real sugar taste. I'm spoiled on corn surup	-1
I don't see much of a change. I even used this with the 3D white toothpaste. Disappointment. Pro is that they are very easy to use and they do not slip off of your teeth!!	-1
I have been experimenting with bodywashes for a while to find the best solution for me. I don't have sensitive skin or anything but I like knowing I am not missing out on something better. This body wash falls short on most of the criteria I find important. The smell of this body wash is almost like...chemical. Granted, most if not all bodywashes are created with chemicals but as I stated, I have dealt with many body washes and I have to say, the scent of this one is at the bottom of the list. Another thing I realized when using this body wash is that often times, I have to go back and get more of it for the first and second scrubs of my body. I think that is from the pump feature that is has, however. It also doesn't leave a pleasant layer of lotion on the skin after use like other body washes. That maybe a preference thing but I personally enjoy that a lot and it has me feeling like I took a more premium shower. I wouldn't recommend this bodywash unless you're coming from lower end solutions like two in one shower gel haha	-1
I wasn't satisfied with this. I am happier with witch hazel.	-1
Bought for my son and he still breaks put badly.	-1
threw it away half way through use	-1
like the quantity, like the pump, but don't like the scent. i'll reuse the pump with other soap.	-1
Good, but oily	-1
The smell is awful. Must be the tar in it. It hasn't really helped my son's scalp yet, but he doesn't use it very much because the smell is terrible.	-1
I don't like this toothbrush it has rubber half circle things in the bristles that just rub your teeth I think they're polishing cups but it's really strange. Also the rough back part of the brush hurts the inside of my cheek. This is the most uncomfortable toothbrush I've ever used. It also has a small head so I'm not sure how much cleaning it can do.	-1
Something seemed off about this conditioner. either it was old or tampered with. It made my hair heavy and greasy, and I've used it for years.	-1
these showed up smelling like dryer sheets.  I donated them.	-1
I love Seventh Generation and like to buy recycled paper goods for the house. I won't be buying these tissues again, though, recycled or not. They're thin and rough. They are probably fine for using once or twice a day, but I have a cold and my nose has been chapped to the point of bleeding using these.  Plus, they're so thin, I pull out two or three just so they don't tear and get snot all over my hands anyway. So saving trees by recycling is probably evened out by using multiple tissues at once.	-1
The tissue is so thin and scratchy it's like blowing my nose in my hands. As a rule, 7th generation products are my go to. After using the facial tissue, I doubt if I will be ordering the toilet paper.	-1
I thought I would give this a try because Seventh Generation has a tremendous reputation AND I have used SG products in the past. I have been using this package for just about a week now and I must let both user and manufacturer know that the factory seal on the closure has come apart. I would like to assume it could be a bad batch because when machinery is putting these packages together there is a point when more glue must be added to the automatic dispensers along the production line. Maybe someone fell asleep and missed the "fill glue bucket" indicator light? I would like to know if any other users have had this same issue. I can say one positive thing here and that is YES, this product is thick and strong! Of course I am using on my arms and legs during these hot summer months. I do not think it is soft enough for a baby's bottom and I would not recommend it to any mother I know.	-1
The wipes are fine-thick, soft, strong enough, and with decent ingredients. The problem is the container. It does not close on one side or in the middle (front) and I can actually see INTO the CLOSED container from the front. This 64 pack of wipes will start to dry out immediately once the package is opened.  I'll have to transfer them to a zip closure bag, which is not desirable due to the need to wash my hands each time prior to reaching in to obtain a wipe. As my intention had been to use the wipes to clean dusty hands when camping, this is not a viable option, therefore these wipes are utterly useless to me. Due to the container problem, I would not buy them again. I rate the wipes a 4, and the container a minus 1, resulting in an averaged score of 1.5. As this score is not available, and per the quality of the wipes, my  rating was raised to 2.	-1
These arrived dry :( displeased with this purchase the wipes had zero moisture	-1
Still the closure will not stay shut on these wipes! Drives me insane. They dried out already	-1
I'm giving this salt scrub two stars only because it does do the intended job of exfoliating and moisturizing. It is not pleasant though. First, the salt crystals are too large. I have used others in which the salt was similar to large sand. These are like 1/2 carat diamonds, very difficult to use effectively, like rubbing a handful of small rocks on the skin. Worse than the grit size is the smell. I had read the ingredients before I purchased and knew there was grapefruit, but the grapefruit smell was so strong and chemical smelling it's offensive. I have to completely wash the oil away with soap when finished and still am left with an unpleasant chemical smell on my skin. I would compare it to the orange scented stuff used to remove grease from mechanics' hands, except that product doesn't burn my nose like this salt scrub. Definitely don't recommend.	-1
Husband said it tastes like pure tea leaves, not a fan.	-1
Not "sweet" enough for my taste	-1
Ordered this to try based upon such glowing reviews relative to how great it allegedly tastes.  Was I ever disappointed.  This stuff has a nasty medicine like taste.  No one in my entire family of six members, ranging in ages from ten to slightly "over the hill" liked it.  Wound up pouring nearly a full bottle down the drain.  Yuk!  Can't recommend nor will I ever buy again.	-1
Goes flat and stale quickly (1 day) after opening.	-1
horrible dusty sandy taste. could not drink it. shook it up ,did not help  I would not buy it again.	-1
Won't purchase again. For me, this tea did not live up to the raving reviews.	-1
It tastes weird, definitely has more water than actual green tea since the value is pretty good if it was actually high quality. It's been more of an hassle to drink it then enjoyment. I bought it since organic + green tea seems like a combo for better health.	-1
This tasted so off to me - like it had gone bad (even though the expiration date was nearly a year away).  Arizona's honey tea tastes a lot better.  I will not buy this again.  I can't understand all of the 4 and 5 star reviews.  To each his own.	-1
I looked forward to trying this tea, but I was disappointed in the taste. I could not taste the peach flavor, and overall the taste was dull. I won't buy this flavor again.	-1
This tea drink is DISGUSTING! I can make this at home easily by boiling a tea bag. I was expecting it to have some kind of taste at least a green tea flavor but I got nothing. The honey they put in this juice doesn't do anything to sweeten it. There is no TASTE! At all. I thought this would be similar to Arizona green tea drink which is good but probably because this is so called organic it didn't have flavor. This would be good for diabetics or people who don't like sweet drinks.  Maybe their other honest tea drinks are better.  I should've read the description before I bought it so I guess its my fault because the bottle states that the honest tea is made to be only a tad sweet, well they aren't lying about that. They claim its made of all good stuff but it has caffeine in it and Im not a fan of that either. Left a bad taste in my mouth, it really does taste like brewed tea with no sugar or sweetener whatsoever. I added sugar to it but it was still bad, reminds me of when I boil tea and let it sit for too long.  No I will NOT buy again, wish I would've paid closer attention to description before I ordered.	-1
We were very disappointed in the flavor of this tea.  I gave it away to any family member who would take it!	-1
No body in my family liked this drink. It had a bunch of fake stuff in it and I was a little upset that it's wasn't and "honest" as it said it was. I ended up just dumping it down the drain. It was upsetting. Natural peach flavor isn't peach it's something else that taste like peaches. I can not recall all the ingredients but I know I was disappointed	-1
second time I ordered these and this batch was over cooked. All were more brown and hard than normal.	-1
It's very light (a little bit too light even for a BB cream) and it highlights pores... I don't hate it but definitely would not buy again nor recommend to a friend.	-1
This mascara dried out inside the tube causing it to get clumpy. There was nothing smooth about this on your eyes. I won't buy this again	-1
meh. it's ok.	-1
Color "light" is very orange. It looks more like a tan product.	-1
This kind of makes my face orange.	-1
L'Oreal is nuts for labeling this shade as "light." This product is not just darker than "light" should be, it's extremely orange. I can't envision any skin tone that this color would match, it's really unnatural. Imagine the worst spray-on tan you've ever seen, and this comes close.  In addition, it's a very heavy coverage, nothing like any other BB cream I have used. Note: this cream squeezes out of the tube white, then develops the bright orange color when you blend it in. The photo below doesn't do it justice, it's far worse in full coverage.  Awful!	-1
Not that great....	-1
its like wearing no makeup	-1
Not a good product. I might as well not wear mascara because that's what it looks like when I wear this.	-1
Terrible product. The wand is awful to work with. The mascara only sat at the base of my lashes when applied, I couldn't get the wand to apply mascara to the whole lash. It made my lashes look thin and skimpy, not full and long. Also because the brush is so big and awkward, it was impossible not to get mascara smudged all over my eyelid when applying. After wearing it for a couple hours, I had noticeable smudging under my eyes.	-1
very disappointed	-1
I actually don't mind the mascara, I hate the brush! The new rubber brushes suck! Clumpy and you have you put on 50 layers. Sorry I would not buy again. Maybelline Soft and Lush all the way for this girl. I love the original bristle brushes they work better,	-1
Not a great brush. Very clumpy. I threw it away after a couple uses.	-1
I've used a lot of L'Oreal products and this has to be at the bottom.  I did nothing for my eyelashes. The brush was not a good shape to cling onto the lashes. I have long lashes, so it doesn't take a whole lot of effort for my mascara. This took forever to try to use and I didn't accomplish a thing. I do not recommend.	-1
A disappointment from Kraft! Not much flavor! It disappears in recipe.	-1
Didn't taste good to me	-1
not was what I thought it was	-1
I do not care for the taste. I bought the actaul wrapped ones and they are better	-1
I bought these for holiday baking and only needed a small amount for a couple of recipes. I assumed that they would melt when baking, but the opposite effect happened and they were as hard as rock. And these are overly sweet. Eating a sugar cube would have been easier. So much for taking shortcuts with a product that I am unfamiliar with.	-1
not a good caramel taste...they taste like little chewy sugar chunks	-1
STALE!	-1
Several packages of these were open upon arival and the ones that weren't were past the expiration date	-1
I love the regular fiber one cakes but not crazy about these cheesecake types.  These are too sugary for me.	-1
Tastes like the processed food that it is.	-1
The bar was tender and moist.  It was a nice size for a snack.  That being said, why the 2 star was:  Taste.  It was cloying to me.  Not of sweet but the over all taste of what they termed cheesecake and salted caramel.  It just wasn't good. I had the desire to rinse my mouth and brush my teeth to get rid of the taste.  I've eaten good cheesecake and bad cheesecake and this wasn't cheesecake it was like some illegitimate version of a cheesecake crossed with a cheese danish crossed with a piece of hardtack.  I felt like I had a film on my teeth and mouth when I was done eating it.  Texture.  It was well... grainy and chalky.  I'm not sure how it managed both but that was the texture.  It's the first time a treat has taken me 45 minutes to eat.  And I need my head examined for doing that.  That was my stupidity.  But now I'm looking at 9 of them and wondering how in the devil I am going to pawn them off on some unsuspecting soul and if I should.  I could have had an apple with 4.4 grams fiber and about 95 calories [med size] vs this for 150 calories and 5 grams of fiber.  And I hate apples.  That's telling you something if my first  thought after finishing it was "I could have had an apple.  It would have tasted so much better."  That being said, you may love it and find the taste suits you.  Our tastebuds are different.  That's why we like different foods.  I'm just telling you what I found and suggesting you taste one before you buy a 10 package box.   I foresee unless someone really likes them, this is going to have a LONG shelf life at my house.  Edited to add:  Hallelujah! My sister will take them [and the Brownies if it turns out I don't like them too.]  She loves them.  That is what I mean by different tastes.	-1
These are awful! Terrible aftertaste! There are better ways and tastier items to get your fiber. Which also won't have saturated fat.	-1
Thesee weren't my favorites....they were quite thick	-1
I really wanted to like these but they were not great. I ate one and unable to finish the box.	-1
These are so sweet.  I didn't realize they were so high in sugar.  There are only 2g of protein and 2g of fiber.  The taste wasn't even very good to make up for these lacks.	-1
These leave a gross after taste. I love lemon cakes and thought these would be good since the chocolate ones are so good. I was wrong!	-1
Way too sweet.	-1
Taste kind of gross....	-1
This product was way too dry for me.  I couldn't finish one bar (and they're small) without drinking half a glass of milk or several swallows of coffee.  You would think the strawberry "filling" would help the dryness but it didn't for me.  Not only that but the strawberry filling had a funny taste.  I wouldn't recommend this product.	-1
yuk, tastes bad	-1
I had high hopes for these but I was let down. Usually FiberOne snacks are great but these had a weird "diet" taste to them and on top of that, they were dry and relatively crumbly. If the box didn't say "cheesecake" on it, I couldn't have guessed what the flavor was.  I'll give it a 2 star instead of 1 but only because the price was reasonable for the portion size and amount in th box.	-1
These taste so gross! I tried one and had to give them to my husband because they tasted so disgusting. They don't taste like cheesecake at all not even artificial cheesecake and the strawberry topping was like eating colored glue. I wouldn't recommend even my dog eating this if i had a dog to feed it too.	-1
Not a big fan. To me they don't have any sort of cheesecake flavor whatsoever. More of a coffee cake flavor. If you buy them expecting a cheesecake flavor you might be disappointed.	-1
Sweet, and more sweet. Flavor? Not so much. I won't repeat the experiment.	-1
worst product ever purchased...bad smell...bad taste...just plan out BAD!	-1
Doesn't taste like spinach. Not really cheesy. Just bland dipping sauce.	-1
I was hoping for something similar to the Apple bees spinach dip it was not. I was not a fan of it. It was very slimy and it wasn't very big. I would say not worth it	-1
Awful, awful, and awful. I actually brushed my teeth after trying this out just to get the taste out of my mouth. Yuck!!!	-1
Not my favorite	-1
This stuff was gross. I have had better luck with store brand spinach dip. Just had a weird cheese flavor. I was really looking forward to it too. :( I will never buy this again! I threw out most of it. What a waste.	-1
Looked good but it was the worse tasting items I have ever bought! I'll stick with TG Friday's.	-1
Obviously, you wouldn't expect a pre-packaged product to be nearly as good as home-made, but f you're looking for something that even REMOTELY resembles those office party spinach-artichoke dips, this is definitely not it.	-1
It was not good. Too salty and really no natural flavor.	-1
Heavy and not much flavor.	-1
This was the worst dip I  have ever tried.  The texture was terrible and the flavor was worse.  I do not recommend this for any one or party.  Waste of my money.	-1
I usually make my own spinach & artichoke dip, but I decided to try this to see if it would be a good substitute to have on hand when I didn't have time to make my own.  Um ... no.  It tasted of neither spinach nor artichokes, with just a slight flavor of cheese, and a LOT of salt.  WAY too much salt.  I'm not sure what the other flavors were, but they weren't anything I was familiar with.  Sort of a thick salty milky pasty liquid with bits of green stuff floating in it.  Cannot recommend this, especially when making homemade is super easy. (frozen spinach, canned or frozen artichokes, sour cream, mayonnaise, pepper jack cheese)	-1
I was excited to try this because I make my own home made spinach and artichoke dip, but I wanted something that I could store for quick and easy access when I wanted a snack. This is by far the worst dip I have ever tasted. I would not recommend, and I will go back to making my own dip. Waste of money.	-1
It's really not that good...unless you dress it ul a bit. I added shredded chicken, cheese, and peppers. It was better.	-1
Love the flavor but will not buy again because it is made with GMO products.	-1
Just too lard-ish.	-1
Used to get this yrs ago. It was a big hit until we had to change diets. Tried it for a one time family party and it was horrible. Nothing like we remembered. Except for a cpl of scoops, it was barely touched by anyone. Never will purchase again,	-1
Too spicy. Impossible to eat	-1
WERE ALL CRUSHED IN THE BAG	-1
For the price of this in one of my more upscale super markets the bags are smaller and ALL of them had less than 50% content in the bag. This was a huge disappointment and I definitely won't order it again	-1
nasty nasty nasty no flavor and stale as hell	-1
New favor that was not too great tasting.  Arrived without any damage and delivery was on time.  Most likely will not order again.	-1
Someone was asleep at the cheese wheel. All I tasted was fake smoke flavor, no cheese whatsoever. This one was a bust for me. First time ever I was disappointed with a Lay's flavor. Would not buy this one again.	-1
The barbecue flavor is horrendous compared to the original BBQ flavor. It is semi-spicy after you eaten a few dozen, but I wouldn't eat this even if Lay's gave me a free unlimited supply.	-1
I was hoping for regular barbecue chips these are the spicy ones and aren't good. Also they got to us all crumbled up in the Prime Pantry box. I don't recommend ordered chips online lol.	-1
Did not taste like chili....	-1
I'm not -that- fussy normally. If it's healthy and fresh I can live without salt or a lot of spices.  But this is terrible stuff. Not only has it no flavor (even if adding salt), but also the cans seem old. (I come from canning family so I know about this.)  The shelf date was only a few months away, too.  So seems someone wanted to get rid of their older stock.  I will say that the cans weren't rusted or dirty. And had only a few tiny dints on the bottom in one.  So they appear safe enough to eat.  But not worth the price.  I wouldn't even want to mix it with other foods to make it palatable.  I'm sorry to be harsh, but truth is truth.  If you've read my other reviews you see I do like a lot of products I buy from Amazon.  Just not this one.  I wish the product were better.  I'm always in quest of no or low salt.  Edit: Amazon is refunding for the 4 unopened cans plus shipping. Which means I had to pay for a can that was inedible. Had I purchased it at my local grocery store I could have returned it there for refund. That is one thing I dislike about online/distance shopping. Otherwise there is a lot about online shopping that is worth it.	-1
Health Valley Organic No Salt Added Soup, Potato Leek, 15 Ounce (425g) (Pack of 12), from Health Valley. This soup, as is, is very bland, and tastes like organic dishwater.  Adding some salt and pepper is a necessity, to make it more edible.  It already contains some spices, but not nearly enough. It also contains a couple of things that I am not too crazy about: canola oil and acacia gum. I do not like the taste of canola oil, and I do not like gums of any kind added to my food.  Adding everything together, this soup could use some improvement.  I appreciate the good start, with 30mg of sodium, but they need a bit more sodium and spices to give the soup some taste.  As it is, right out of the can, I can only give this Health Valley Organic Potato Leek Soup two Amazon stars.

when I received the bag, the chips were broken into tiny pieces like the bag had been smashed. This is the second time I have notified you of this problem, I even sent a photo last time.	-1
Southern biscuits & gravy????????  Don't think so, maybe northern biscuits & gravy?? Don't like them, and will NOT buy again.	-1
Not what I expected, would not order again	-1
Really sad !	-1
did taste as described however not what you want in a chip	-1
Never again. Tastes nothing like biscuits and gravy.	-1
I have no idea how these taste since my bag was open when I got it.  Looked like it somehow exploded a little bit from inside the bag.	-1
These had a very strange ground beef and thyme flavor which was not pleasant.	-1
What the heck do I know? Hailey Green, who submitted the idea for Lay's Southern Biscuits and Gravy, will take home a $1 million grand prize or one percent of her winning flavor's net sales through July 15, 2016 (whichever is higher). Although, I cannot imagine the net sales will be the higher figure.  The white gravy-flavored chip tastes first of black pepper and sour cream before the sausage and sage flavoring engages. Instead of a pleasant umami combination, the chip devolves into something akin to pasty, powdery salt. The texture doesnt help. I cant help but wonder if a ridged (ruffled) chip wouldve worked better with this flavor profile, which evokes thoughts of fluffy biscuits rather than greasy potato chips. The seasoning is caked on the flat chips so thick as to render them chewy instead of crisp.  Rating: One star	-1
Gravy is for breakfast, not for chips.	-1
Please note that this is just my own personal opinion and reflects the rejection by my own personal taste buds. Someone out there might actually like these..... I hope...Because Lays invested  money to put these things out on the market. I purchase these and was rather excited to have a go at this new flavor. I thought, how bad can this really be? I quickly opened the bag with that plasticky pop sound that only chip bags can make. Immediately the odour hit my nostrils-- my facial muscles automatically contorted in disgust. The parfum eu de gyro was pungent and ripe. The scent was some sort of forging of cheap chicken ramen and soured cucumber yogurt. I remained steadfast and moved forward-- telling myself that I shouldn't judge a bag of chips at the first waft of crisp fumes. I dove in, grabbed two chips and shoved them in my gaping pie-hole...... oh dear!!!. My guts churned in response screaming "what have you done?!?!?!?!" I was not going to be taken down by these chips. I chewed, smacked, licked my fingers, cleared my palate.... nope...definite no go. The after taste hit my mouth like Homey the clown slapping my chops with that red sock. If I ever had to guess what butt tasted like, this would be it. I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth! I decided to make a run for the border.... I sat in the Taco Bell drive through and got some "authentic" mexican food. My goal here was to flush this vile taste out of my mouth and exercise these demon chips from my guts.... 22 min and 12 seconds later I was on my porcelain throne... mission accomplished. Moral of the story here.... just don't do it. The lesson I learned here? I dunno, I just bought the darn biscuits and gravy flavor to further punish my guts... I have learned nothing. take what you will from this review.	-1
I love gyros. Have for years. Try as I might, I cannot find anything in these that says gyros. I'm not sure what I will do with them, cause they're not :bad: but not great.	-1
Sorry, Lays, this was not good. I was one of the people who suggested a gyro flavor, but this didn't taste like a gyro to me. I couldn't even finish the bag. I don't think that's ever happened with a bag of chips around here - they usually don't last long at all. I threw away half the bag. I love the regular Lays, though, and I'll still buy those. If they decide to try the gyro taste again, they need to think more beef and more yogurt, cucumbers and garlic. I don't know what they did to these.	-1
If you are a fan of truffles then I'm pretty sure you'll be disappointed in these 'truffle fries' from Lay's. I was the most excited to try these out of the four new flavors; only to find that they basically taste like a less flavorful version of sour cream and onion chips.  The ingredients are: Potatoes, Vegetable Oil, Truffle Fries Seasoning (Salt, Cheddar Cheese, Maltodextrin, Spices, Sunflower Oil, Garlic Powder, Lactose, Whey Protein Concentrate, Whey, Natural Flavor, Corn Syrup Solids, Romano Cheese, Butter, Caramel Color, Yeast Extract, Buttermilk, Skim Milk, Duck Fat, Chicken Fat, Sodium Caseinate, Sugar, Black Truffle, Lactic Acid, and Parmesean Cheese).	-1
They call it Reuben but I don't taste it.	-1
I am sensitive to chemical smells and this product has an overbearing Artificial "Deodorant" Smell ..others may not mind that strong sent but I wish I could send it back.	-1
Not for me....	-1
I never tried it.  Gave it to a friend.	-1
Puffed millet is in a plastic bag and smells with plastic when open. Tastes like millet with plastic. I will not buy again. I don't know if it is even tasty.	-1
I was not very fond of the flavor of these. I know they're low calorie but I didn't taste any peanut butter. My son felt differently and liked them so he ate the rest.	-1
none	-1
My dad used to eat a cereal called puffed rice and puffed wheat, so I guess I thought these would be the same, but they are teeny, tiny, little balls.  I through them out for the birds.	-1
Stale and no flavor!	-1
I love Cinnamon. But really didn't like these	-1
this box was also torn so badly that I could hardly tell it was a box of storage bags.	-1
I was looking forward to getting this because I know they are popular and I figured it would be a good tool in my fight against dust.  Alas, not so.  There is a design flaw.  The replacement duster does not stay on the handle, simple as that.  I tried adjusting it several times. No go.  So I would be in the middle of dusting something and the duster head would go flying.  Waste of time.  And the duster is not any marvel either.  A microfiber cloth for s a much better job without creating a bunch of throwaway duster heads.	-1
Very small bites	-1
egad; saw the picture, have bought the frosted variety before that is good with a only a hint of sugar, but on this one missed the word strawberry, open the box and smells like a chemistry lab, the milk turns pink, there is no taste of wheat anymore, and it takes quite a while to get rid of the flavor chemists's idea of strawberry, which turns to sour strawberry, after you're done; maybe the birds will eat it	-1
Not my favorite flavor. Strange taste	-1
I fully expect a bag of popcorn to have unpopped kernels at the bottom of the bag, but these bags (I bought two, buy one get one free at the store) had a huge amount of half popped kernels. I do not exaggerate when I say every handful had at least two of these tooth-cracking kernels, making it an unenjoyable experience. I can tolerate the weak flavor since I have some of those bottles of popcorn flavoring, but the unpopped kernels are too much. The photo is typical of what's in one handful.	-1
Not enough taste for me. And, this brand seems to always have these little hard parts (not kernels) that feel like they're going to break my teeth.	-1
If you rate this popcorn based on taste alone, it deserves a five star rating.  The flavor is absolutely delicious, and one might find themselves devouring the entire bag at one sitting.  Now for the bad - The parent company is Frito Lay. This is a corporation who is guilty of poisoning its customers daily through using GMO (Genetically Engineered) corn in their products. When I first decided to purchase this popcorn, I bought it because on the bag it specifically states No Artificial Colors, Flavors, or Preservatives.  What I didn't notice until later, was a line on the bag that says - Partially Produced with Genetic Engineering  So basically, my take on this product is that instead of calling this Frito Lay Popcorn, they disguise it by calling it "Smartfood delight" - making us think that this is a healthier alternative by claiming that it has No artificial colors, Flavors, or preservatives...but if the popcorn itself is GMO (Genetically engineered) Corn, does anything else really matter?  There is nothing healthy about GMO foods. Furthermore the companies who try to feed them to us through deceptive marketing and advertising should be punished or at the very least called out publicly and shamed for their unethical behavior.  The reason I decided to give this product a 1 star rating is because I want people to read my review, and I don't feel as if a 2 or 3 star review would get looked at, as much as a 1 star review.  I also want to reiterate that the product does taste delicious,  so if you are the type of person who doesn't care about whether or not you were eating genetically engineered foods, then this product is a popcorn that you would buy based on taste alone. As for the rest of us, I feel like I just got bamboozled because I didn't read the bag close enough when making the original purchase.  I have included two pics from a bag of their White Chedder flavor to help illustrate my points.	-1
These are too salty for my taste.	-1
The Orange one is better !!!	-1
All the goodness of Simply Cheetos Puffs does not make up for the uninteresting taste and texture. After the first bite, it sort of "disappears" in the mouth. Not crisp, has enough salt but somehow lacks that "punch". After a cup full of Simply Cheetos Puffs, my craving for a snack continued. You could say that it wasn't a satisfying experience.	-1
I love Cheetos but these tasted so weird, definitely not like white cheddar,,,,,wouldn't buy again.	-1
Not impressed. Actually disappointed. I don't taste much cheese, as one does with the original Cheetos. I'm glad I tried them. Now I know not to buy them again. I was hoping for a much more flavorful snack, like the white cheddar popcorn is. I really enjoy white cheddar popcorn.   I read the reviews, but I truly thought they couldn't be as bland and unflavored as people reviewed. WOW! They were completely correct. I'll never buy these again. I recommend you save your money and buy the real Cheetos. Those are the original real cheesy puffs. You just can't mess with what already works...or in this case...tastes.	-1
Too much sodium	-1
I get it that this is "simply cheetos" but simple shouldn't mean bland.  I have other puffs from other brands that I've tried that are even all organic and they have much more flavor than these do.  These honestly have no noticeable white cheddar flavor at all.  I'm not sure why these tastes so much blander than they used to but I can't recommend these at all.  These will not be purchased again	-1
Nice texture, kinda bland.	-1
We didn't care for these at all.  Doesn't taste like any white cheddar I've ever had.	-1
One of my favorite snacks is the "traditional" orange Cheetos Cheese Puffs.  When I saw this white cheddar variety, I had to give it a try.  Yeah, not a fan.  The cheese flavor is almost too "light" to be recognizable as cheese.  They're reminiscent of the old orange cheese puffs in texture, but the flavor just isn't there.  I know these are "white cheddar," so I was expecting a slight difference in flavor, but did not expect it to be almost non-existent.  It was worth a try, but sorry -- won't purchase these again.	-1
Cool that it's gluten free but taste is not so cheesy	-1
These have been my favorite snack for a long time, but the last few bags that I have bought have tasted different. They have changed them. They don't have nearly as much cheese flavor as before,but they have a stronger,spicier taste,and they are a lot harder. I hope they change them back to the way they used to be,or I'm definitely gonna have to find a new snack.	-1
I bought the Munchies Snack Mix Cheese Fix to try something different. My husband and I both tried these and neither of us cared for them. My husband thought that they were too hard to eat and he was not just talking about the pretzels in the bag. I tend to agree. I also was disappointment in the "cheese" as there seems to be a need for more of a cheese taste. I found the price fair for the quantity that you received but I honestly can not and will not recommend these.	-1
too crunchy (hard) and too salty.	-1
Not the best potato chip. I do appreciate that it's non gmo, etc. I won't be purchasing ever again.	-1
The rolls didn't seem like double rolls so I wouldn't order again online.	-1
Do not purchase.  Very small rolls and can get it cheaper other places.	-1
Seth Wheeler of Albany, New York, obtained the earliest United States patents for toilet paper and dispensers, the types of which eventually were in common use in that country, in 1883  i found this bit of info on wikipedia. it caught my eye, as i lived in the albany area for a good part of my life, i was actually looking to find out just when scott started making their toilet paper, and ended up at their web site, but its as bad as the new and improved crap they are selling with the name scott on it. i wanted to see when they started making it, because i am pretty sure i've used it practically every day of my life since i was toilet trained 67 years ago. and loved it. notice i write in the past tense. this new and improved variety is really awful. i know their standard roll has gone way down in quality, but this stuff is so bad i nearly threw it out, but i'm half-scottish and its true what they say. we ARE thrifty. i wouldn't recommend this product for even use in a porta john	-1
This is a legitimate, intelligible 1-Star review for this Toilet Paper. It's marketed as dual-textured, double rolls, but the only truth behind that is that, yes, they are double rolls. The issue is they're nowhere near dual-textured. When you rip it off the roll they tear easily in half. You have to focus when you tear a sheet off so that it doesn't rip off at a random location. When you're wiping, it's easy to push your finger through the paper, even when you double over the sheets.  Toilet paper from the dollar store is better than this brand. The only decent takeaway is buying these in bulk saves you some money, but once you realize you now have 12 of these terrible rolls for the next month or two, that instantly become a headache.  Highly recommend you stay away from this brand and look elsewhere.	-1
What's up with toilet paper rolls getting smaller and smaller? Not the actual sheets themselves but the length of the sheet. When you put it on the roller there is a full inch on each side of the roller that's empty. Once again the consumer gets cheated.	-1
arrived smashed....but still tastey	-1
I should have read the product description more carefully. These are the higher end, softer, and fluffier than the regular Scott. So you get much less  paper on a roll and it gets used up really fast so it is no bargain, Would not buy again,	-1
i like the old type wrapped in paper  tissue is stronger  the softer tissue falls apart	-1
Cheapo, skinny rolls that last a day or two. Definitely not purchasing again.	-1
And this isnt' it.  This stuff is weirdly not very absorbent, so you had to keep using more just to clean up after #1. The rolls run out really quickly. I prefer regular Scott toilet paper to this.	-1
This is not a soft tissue. The rolls are not really double rolls, same size as standard rolls..	-1
Oven backed just don't do it for me in this flavor.	-1
These rolls are really small. They are soft but we go through them super quick because they are tiny.	-1
not worth the money terrible paper towels	-1
No no no satay away	-1
not a fan of the oven baked but my kid loves them	-1
Not many sheets per roll. Stick with the original.	-1
Did not like this product at all. It gets used up extremely quickly compared to other brands, does not absorb efficiently, and tears up.	-1
Not impressed with this brand/type; the sheets seemed to tear easily (not just at the perforations). Otherwise pretty good but I don't plan to buy it again.	-1
not worth the price	-1
This toilet paper is not worth the price. For about fifty cents more you can purchase the same amount of toilet paper in a brand that is softer and won't fall apart when you're trying to wipe. If it were less than half the price it sells for I would consider saying it was a good deal. As is, it is a rip off.	-1
This toilet paper was a bust in our house. It is very thin, rips easy and the rolls aren't very good.	-1
Goes fast.	-1
This has to be the most linty toilet paper I have ever used.  I have used the regular Scott and it was no where near as bad as this. This just fell apart.	-1
I usually buy Scott's other t/p and it lasts a whole lot longer than this does.  Even cutting down on the amount of the t/p that I use, this t/p gets used up in only one day - and I'm the only one using it!  It's soft, alright, but I'm fine with the other, less expensive t/p that lasts several days long and more.  This was a waste of money.	-1
Nice and soft but a roll goes by too fast. Will be buying a brand that has more toilet paper for the price	-1
I won't be purchasing this item again. I don't feel like it got my makeup off at all, which is what I purchased it as, a makeup remover. I swear I had just as much eyemake up on after I used it as before.	-1
The bag doesn't close. As soon as you open it, it's on it's way to drying out. If you put it in your purse, you never know what's going to end up inside of it. I guess I could use it for emergency toilet paper.	-1
These feel really rough on your skin. I think I prefer the Burts Bee's brand	-1
When i received the box it was damaged and laundry detergent was all inside box spilled on food and can of sprite was exploded and cookies had soap all over them and box of Barilla Pasta, Spaghetti, 32 Ounce was open and popcorn with soap every where so I am a little mad right now!!	-1
Left my hair very dry/flaky. Much to much soap/suds. Not easy to rinse out.	-1
This made my scalp very dry and itchy.	-1
Holy Moses, this stuff stinks! I washed my hair and for the whole day I smelled like I was a little old lady with no sense of smell who had bathed in old lady perfume from the 1920's. Ugh. Unbearably stinky and it's so strong.  I love Suave but this stuff in horrid.	-1
Not my cup of tea...taste is horrible to me.	-1
They were not fresh	-1
Nothing wrong with the shipment, just didn't think they tasted very good	-1
We were looking for healthier alternatives to my favorite snacks, my wife bought these and they're gross. Too cakey, but also dry and kind of flavorless. I can't eat them and my wife is gluten intolerant, so now they're bird food.	-1
still cant find the mocha and oats fiber one bars...these were good but not what we were looking for	-1
Spotted some things in my wash.	-1
Not what I expected	-1
I was disappointed. This is nothing like liquid bleach -- even after mixing with water, of course.	-1
They are much more convenient than liquid bleach but they are also very expensive!!	-1
Convenient but didn't seem very potent. Went back to using regular liquid bleach for my whites.	-1
Opening the plastic container (with the directions on the top of this container) is H O R R I B LE........Achieved if once and thought I had it down pat, however, could do it the 9th, 10th - - - 30th time.  This is ridiculous  and I won't purchase this product again because of this factor.  I keep it in the bathroom and don't turn the cover as directions stipulate because of the time consuming processes of opening IT...... TERRIBLE  !!!!  Definitely won't purchase these bleach packs again,,,,,,  sorry folks.  P.s  Agree with lady that said she expected a tub full of bleach tablets, instead we got a mug full and gals these are wicked strong that is if you can open the can.....LOL	-1
Brought with pantry and this was packed with the food. Yuck. Who does that?	-1
Mixed feelings. I purchased these as an option to prevent over measuring / overuse.  As Clorox liquid reformulated to a stronger concentration I was concerned because the gasket of my front loading washing machine was showing wear (gray faded).  I switched to this product and was happy that they were self contained but disappointed that: 1. I had damage to my Clorox brand dish towels; The Clorox tablets "melted" the fabric of the Clorox dish towels and they had only been washed 5-7 times. The washer was filled with 12 dishtowels and a tablecloth.  I would only use these tablets if you have a very full load; they are strong and could possibly damage fabrics  Update 12.15.17: My fears were true - the gasket area that had worn down to a lighter color a year ago has truly cracked in the weakened area.  The new HE machines just don't use enough water to rinse out this product out of the machine after the cycle is over.  Update 3.18.18: Indeed had to replace the inner gasket of the washer - after it was removed I found two other hairline cracks.  My end assessment remains - not enough water in the front loading washers to completely rinse this product free of your washers gasket. Of note Amazon sells replacement gaskets and although it was an off brand it still fit the drum of our washer.	-1
Still think bleach out of a gallon container is much easier.	-1
Very gross tasting	-1
Not as good as I was hoping.	-1
tastes is a little weak	-1
Soggy and not a good flavor	-1
Awful. I love everything Kashi makes except for this cereal. It is so gross. It tastes like stale grains of cardboard.  I know it is unsweetened. That's not my problem with it. You know how Rice Krispies dissolve in your mouth? You know how you can chew them and they don't hurt your jaw? Yeah, these don't work like that.  Avoid. So gross.	-1
Yuck, not taste, soft, = didn't like at all!	-1
This would be a great product if they added no sugar and please no artificial sweetener either!.  Kashi, sales would have to be better!  Folks can add sugar or artificial sweetener if they want it but we can't take it off!	-1
very dry not flavorful	-1
I won't lie, these were pretty terrible. I'm not quite how you can take something that has such great components, and have it taste so terrible. Additionally, it doesn't really stick all together, so it isn't really a granola-bar but more like granola-ish. I don't know really what to do with the 4 more in the box...	-1
apricot? what apricot?	-1
While I'm glad that it's fluoride free.... I am not pleased to see that it has sodium lauryl sulfate in it.....at all.... especially since I see that ingredient in soaps and shampoos.... why is it in a product that goes in mouths??  I try so hard to avoid that in products my children use...it's my mistake for not reading the label clearly before ordering.  HIGHLY disappointed and disgusted  in the ingredient list so once this tube is done...we will be using something much more organic....even if I have to make it myself.	-1
Kids did not like the flavor..	-1
This stuff made my hair feel terrible. It is very thick and my hair just wasn't a fan.	-1
I noticed no volume using this shampoo.  2 stars because it cleans my hair. I have long, fine hair and after using this still have long, fine hair.	-1
I guess all pop tarts are dry, but I was expecting the filling to have more flavor and be more gooey.	-1
My kids don't like the flavor.	-1
Discusting flavor would not recommend.	-1
Didn't like the flavor	-1
No one in my home liked these.  They were odd.	-1
Okay..,.. this product is a miss. The filling isn't enough and the jelly has sort of a bitter(???) aftertaste i n my opinion.  Although I love many kinds of PopTarts, this flavor is best left to sandwiches	-1
Gross	-1
Wasn't real crazy about this flavor. A little too bland, and not quite a traditional PB&J taste.	-1
I cannot describe the taste of these but they are not very good. I can say that the taste does not resemble pb&j more like a chemical type taste.  They are slightly more palatable once heated (the kids actually liked them then). Nice try, Pop-Tarts!	-1
not worth the price	-1
worst pop tarts I have ever tried. I threw the entire package away after just one bite.	-1
My family occasionally eats Pop-Tarts, but these got a big thumbs down in our household. They are very sweet, and the peanut butter flavor is extremely artificial tasting. The strawberry flavor is ok, but paired with the peanut butter, it tastes horrible. We tossed the rest of the box.	-1
NO.  No, no, no, no, no.  Just stop.  Do not buy these.  My kids took one bit and refuse to touch them.  They are the least pickiest beings on this planet and they both haaaated them.  So of course me and my husband tried and GET OUTTA HERE.	-1
Disappointed with these.  Between the artificial strawberry and artificial chocolate taste, they just taste - well - artificial.	-1
the taste was not bad, but i bought these for grandchildren, and was rather disturbed when i noticed the date on the package after they ate them. they are all expired.	-1
horrible...i guess that's why they were so cheap....blah	-1
This is a chocolate overload. A little sweet for my liking. Will not buy this product again. Hard to mess up chocolate but they did it with this product.	-1
Yucky.that is all I can say.	-1
IF  YOU WANT CHOCOLATE THESE ARE VERY CHOCALTY	-1
Were too small to use...maybe a baby could use. I trashed them/	-1
Nothing special. Save your money. I expected more lip moisturizing from this company, but it just felt like waxy lip covering and not diferent from any other cheapo product. Other brands feel better on my lips than this did.	-1
I've been using Wen for years and thought this may be a good replacement at a lower cost. The consistency of the cleanser is very thin so I had to use more and I had tangles in my hair.	-1
I could not stand the smell of this conditioner and the pump was broken. I couldn't even finish the bottle because I hated the weird smell it had, it did not smell sweet to me.	-1
The tip on these Q-tips is thin and the therefore you feel the stick part a lot more. I figured they would be softer because they are for babies...my mistake.	-1
The best QTip there is.  Too bad it's made by one of the worst Corporations in modern history.	-1
Saunders 8.5" x 12" SlimMate Plastic Storage Clipboard, Letter Size, Pink (00835)  I purchased this based on other reviews, and I am extremely disappointed in the product.  The plastic is flimsy and the clipboard surface bends under writing pressure, and the sides don't come together well.  The clip is loose and slides around when I try to lift it to insert paper.  The clasp does not have a quality feel.  I don't expect this product to last very long.  I don't recommend this.	-1
I thought this was regular printer paper..it is  it. Thick, fewer pieces in the team. Hard to use in home printer. Bad description!!!	-1
Not what I thought it was - very stiff - Amazon though as wonderful as they are let me keep it no charge - let me order correct paper	-1
The short elastic band that keeps it closed (by coming from the back around the bottom to loop around a button on the front flap) will only allow for about 3 inches of expansion at the bottom.  It gets about as wide as the picture shows. Also the plastic it is made from feels flimsy to me, especially the dividers. Comes with 1 set of paper label inserts. Peel-off product label and ready for use. The last one I had was a very heavy paper stock that lasted years, had a long elastic band that went all the way around the file- it felt more "heavy duty" than this. It also was expanded to about 6 inches across the bottom so I know this one won't be enough - returned.	-1
wrong texture	-1
This tasted gross. And left an odd film.	-1
Didn't like the flavor	-1
Way too strong	-1
Love Listerine and had high hopes for this. I'll keep using it to see if it works and basically to use it up. Just know the flavor is very chemical tasting.	-1
Quite rancid taste & not evidently anywhere near as effective, as Falsely Advertised!	-1
Too much fizzing, feels weird and I want to keep spitting it out because of the odd fizz.	-1
This is the best face moisturizer I have ever used and I have used it for years	-1
DID NOT MAKE THROUGH 8 HOURS PROTECTION.	-1
The orange smell is really quite pungent and artificial. I really do not like this version of the shampoo at all. It also leaves my hair feeling less than clean...like it has a film on it.	-1
Note that this is a post swim shampoo, not great for daily use.	-1
Tested on animals.	-1
Whew! This soap is way too fragrant. I couldn't stang the strong smell.	-1
2 year old won't use it. Says it tastes bad.	-1
It was crushed in the box.	-1
Not as expected	-1
it smells like coconut, wich is fine to eat but I don't want smell like it!  It ruined every meal I had, the 1st (And only) time I used it!	-1
Leaves hair sticky	-1
I get that this is a much healthier alternative to typical OTC toothpastes, however the taste isn't easy to like. Perhaps with time I won't mind it as much.	-1
These pens leave gloppy ink every time I use them. Surprising for BIC.	-1
Eh, I think I like the old "picker" style of staple remover. It seems easy, but I still spend time wrangling the staples out.	-1
I use these for many different things including recipes, notes, and phone number cards.  When I choose to use an index card rather than paper, I do so because I want it to last and stand up to repeated handling.  These cards are the thinnest index cards I have ever purchased.  I've used Oxford brand index cards in the past and they were of a much higher quality.  These are nowhere near the thickness of cardstock.  They are thicker than construction paper but not what I expect out of an index card.  They are true to size and have easy to see, vibrant lines on one side.  I will use them but not for anything I need or expect to last.  They were an excellent price as I paid only 89 for a pack of 100.  But they are not really a good deal because the old saying "you get what you pay for" fully applies to these.	-1
BULLCRAP, NEVER BUY THESE. THEY ARE LIKE FLIMSY TOILET PAPER WITH LINES. GET THE THICKER ONES ONLY TRUST ME.	-1
Tears  and  didn't  work.  I  like  the white  out  liquid  and  pens.	-1
Useless. Do not buy. I ended up getting the correction fluid.	-1
Both of them broke after using them only a few times. I have used these before and know how to use them. Frustration.	-1
The tape didn't want to go back into the dispenser. It would just come out and unravel. Unusable.	-1
I''ve messed up both of these as apparently there is some super-skill set that I don't have to use them. I end up with strings of white junk all over my hands.  Too techie for me!	-1
These are NOT gluten free!  Im a celiac and Im surprised the manufacturer wouldnt own up to it.	-1
weird, unpleasant texture, like wax.	-1
These vitamins are HUGE and pretty flavorless. I think chalk tastes like this. I am also not crazy about the addition of Vitamin K since it helps the blood to clot and I have a clotting disorder. Flinstone chewables are a much better choice. I have to have chewables after gastric bypass surgery and since I have trouble swallowing regular (often too large to swallow) vitamins.	-1
the heat it promised to emit was just not there, I guess it's back to looking for a product that works.	-1
Chips was broken	-1
The chips tasted good , but, were all broken up.  Same with the other cans.  Maybe because it was a large Oder with	-1
Gross	-1
I ordered these as a gift for my sister she said they were really little and terribly stale and hard her son called the manufacture	-1
These were actually a little on the dry side. They tasted fine otherwise.	-1
These are nothing great.  Rather tasteless and not worth the calories or the carbs.	-1
terrible flavor, dry texture. won't buy again	-1
My Son loves these so I'm giving 5 stars in spite of the fact that the cans were dented. I get these for him as a treat once in a while. I should feed him food from a dented can? What a WASTE.	-1
My son refused to eat them, so I tasted it and no wonder. Its worse than ketchup on pasta.	-1
Not good at all	-1
Did not like. Used to eat these as a kid and thought they tasted great. Now, as an adult, these things taste horrible. Meatballs were mushy and the O's had almost no taste to them. Better these stay as a childhood memory than anything considered edible.	-1
sucks	-1
You know that you're in trouble when the primary ingredient listed on the label is water, followed by a whole lot of sugar, MSG, chemicals, and preservatives that I cannot pronounce.  They even seem to be listing tomatoes as a vegetable, when we all know that it is a fruit, and I am terrified to even ask what's in the meatballs.  Campbell's  Spaghetti O's is completely watered down and tasteless, which is what seems to be happening to all of Campbell's products.  If I cannot put this stuff in my mouth, I can never feed it to my kids.	-1
The chicory tastes terrible. One of the worst coffee I have ever had. Avoid!	-1
The two star means I don't like it.  You may very well like it.  It's very sweet tasting.  I forgot why I didn't like Silk.  Now I remember.  If you want a sweet vanilla drink this will suit you.  If you are trying to avoid sugar, it has 16 grams for 8 ounces which makes it very sweet. The other half always adored this but I like the unsweetened brands best.  I was pleased to see it was labeled as Non-GMO.  it's just a shame it's too sweet for me.  I'll finish the box but get something else next time.	-1
I wanted to like this tea. I gave it several chances, but it had too much of an artificial taste to me. I think the honey and vanilla flavorings are natural, but they just don't taste very good in this tea. I think it's the honey flavoring that I don't care for. I won't buy this one again.	-1
Not at all as pictured. 80% almonds. 15% cashews 5% other nuts. And why no Brazil nuts? If you are lucky you might get 4 pecans. Disapointing.	-1
Most of the nuts are cashew halves and almonds. Very few brazil nuts, hardly any pecans and few pistachio nuts. Would not order again.	-1
Not quite sure why others like this.  I bought it due to the good reviews.  It did not taste good.	-1
Super thick and took too much time warming in hot water when I was trying to use it.	-1
Not worth the money I spent on the product, but it is honey, just didn't taste any differnet	-1
Its almost solid when i get it and that's why it gets low grades. Too crystallized.  However, the flavor is wonderful is better than expected so it may be a better grade over time.  It must be warmed up to use the top or as I did, take the top off and spoon it out.  For this jar, I expected more.	-1
I am not 100% sure, but it seems that this box contains mostly peanuts!	-1
Mostly peanuts.  Back to buying Kirkland.  Hardly any Pecans.	-1
Can clearly states less than 50% peanuts. I separated the other nuts because I needed them for something I was baking, and the can was still more than half full. Not a scientific study but even 49% peanuts are still too many peanuts.	-1
Too sweet for us.	-1
Weird taste. Unpleasant. Tastes fake	-1
This was basically sugar with a side of coffee. Pretty bad in my opinion.	-1
I can't see the small picture, but if this is the French Vanilla: it was an old box or moisture got to it & was cracked open on the bottom. For Shame. Other than that, I guess it'll be fine, I hvnt tasted it, wondering if I should, they are individually sealed so...	-1
IF you want a sugar buzz, these are for you.  I didi not find much cappuccino taste or feel, instead it is over sweet with too much vanilla.  IF they cut back on the sugar and just had a nice hint of vanilla, these might be okay.  It just seems like they use the sugar and flavor to compensate for a lack of coffee and real flavor	-1
Tastes overly acidid for such a dark coffee, and so it screams for cream and sugar. Very similar to Starbucks Morning Joe, except I paid $9 for this bag of ground stuff (prices fluctuate) and not again, thanks. For the same money or less Ill be ordering the Starbucks Sumatra (excellent), and for a great value, Seattles Best Post Alley/No. 5 roast is excellent at $5 plus change both of those regularly available on Prime Pantry and come in whole bean for the freshest taste.	-1
Granola?  Not really.  These have no crunch but the oats actually taste as though they have been araved out of linoleum.  Very disappointing product.  I've gone back to making my own.	-1
I'm not sure I'd call this granola.  It's more like a flavored oatmeal.  And the flavor isn't very strong, which is good, since it's not very tasty.  I don't need to buy this again.	-1
I seriously try to avoid sugar and grain, so was disappointed to find both in this mix. Many people will find it very tasty, I am sure.	-1
This isn't very good.  The pancakes don't have enough texture to them to even be able to pick them up with a fork.	-1
over half of these were rejected by my Keurig machine...would like my money back!	-1
Very bad for your health. Corn syrup and other bad sugars are in it masked with other names but STILL sugars.	-1
It was way too hard to chew almost unpleasurable.	-1
The whole office hated this coffee. Tough to store. Leaves a weird residue in the bottom of your cup.	-1
My children opened a few of these before we handed them out for Halloween.  The candy was old and had melted and remelted...it tasted off so we threw it away.	-1
It had melted so it's icky	-1
kona BLENDS are not worth the trouble...if mostly arabica it should be labeled differently. if hot dogs used the same labeling standard, then they would be called "fly blend"	-1
Very displeased that this was ONE bowl, not EIGHT as described. I paid more for this one bowl of cake, than I would have at the store! VERY UNHAPPY. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing.	-1
The price of $3.40 for 1 of these is ridiculous, they sell in High End Grocery stores for $2.00. Add to that they are very small -not much bigger than your hand and a light chocolate cake with essentially some frosting in the center -they aren't worth it. Sometimes I really wonder who picks the things for Prime Pantry- it has less a selection of what you need versus what Amazon's sellers apparently want to get rid of at inflated prices.	-1
I expected to love these but they just weren't that great. I prefer Girl Scouts Tagalongs, which another customer said these were better than. They are not. My 7 year old son who loves PB didn't even like them.	-1
What a mess there was more cookie stuck to packaging then on the cookie....never again	-1
Keebler, this seems like a failed experiment, all melted at room temperature, stick with your core products	-1
Due to a mixup by UPS, our order arrived on a day when we were at work. The pantry box was lecture at the road in a large drop box that is partially shaded. These cookies were packed in the box on their end. In the afternoon heat, these cookies melted and crumbled into a big pile of goo more suitable as an ice cream topping than a cookie. Probably would do better in cooler weather but even in this condition, they still taste great.	-1
These cookies were very stale would not buy them again	-1
The peanut butter and chocolate were good, but the cookies tasted dry and stale. Won't be buying again, was interesting idea though.	-1
Didn't like them. I'm an adult. Who knew I wouldn't like them.	-1
I thought with the Keebler name the peanut butter crackers would be pretty good. Just not enough peanut butter to give your tatse buds any flavor beyond cracker. Its just that simple. Fresh crackers though, but not much flavor.	-1
I usually like these crackers but the two boxes I received were over baked and burned around the edged.	-1
They are a bit dry. Very hard. And not a whole lot of flavor.  Personally,  I did not like them.	-1
I bought the granola because Special K usually produces tasty cereals.  My plan was to add the granola to yogurt to bump up the texture and add a little zing.  It didn't work. This is one of the few Special K products I won't buy again.  I thought tasted bad in the yogurt, bad as a snack, and bad as cereal.	-1
The plastic on the box was torn... The crackers were loose in the box was not happy!	-1
Not at all effective, just puts on a thin layer of silicone and does pick up some dust if not too dirty other wise it just smears it around.	-1
Ugh. This might seems like a good alternative to actually shining your shoes with polish. It's not.  I thoroughly rubbed this thing on a pair of black loafers that needed a shine. It did make them shiny, almost wet-looking - but then I looked closer. It was easy to see spots of unshined leather - it doesn't cover well. Plus, the area that were shiny clearly looked as if some shiny substance had been sprayed on them.  Lesson learned: I'll take the time to actually shine my shoes from now on.

Doesn't last too long after opening, even with the case it comes in. Works great while it's fresh but it's a dud by the second day. Once you open it you better make sure you use all of it as it won't be good later.	-1
Just OK.  Not the best.	-1
its real go pop but its allgone the price was right and I grsabed now will buy it in the store save price but at 5.69 a 12 pack	-1
really high sodium. no taste of cherries whatsoever. flat	-1
ordered per pantry and every one tastes old.	-1
4 cans were swollen up and could not be used.	-1
I received a bad batch of these....it tasted just like water....I know it doesn't normally taste like that, since I am usually a huge coke fan, but apparently some of the ones currently in stock are colored water...I'll just start buying pepsi from prime pantry for awhile to give time for amazon to replace their coke stock.  I bought a Coke zero 12 pack at the same time, and that was fine....but Cherry Zero was just messed up. :/	-1
NOT LIKE THE GINGER ALE OF OLD BY CANADA DRY.  I WON'T PURCHASE AGAIN AND I HAD SUCH A TASTE FOR IT TOO BUT NO ONE HERE WILL DRINK IT	-1
Wow, this purchase was disappointing on every level. The ginger flavor is weak with no zing, and seems almost watered down. Additionally, the inclusion of sucralose (Splenda) in a non-diet labeled soda is an unwelcome discovery. And, rightly or wrongly, I feel a lingering annoyance at the lack of forthrightness.  Stating 25% less calories on the box does not automatically indicate the use of an artificial sweetener. Seagrams shares the name with a line of liquor so I hoped the soda would simply be a little less syrupy sweet, with a flavor perhaps a bit more grown-up -- but not diet.  Usually the packaging boldly states Diet or Ten or some other indication of an artificially sweetened product. It is common for people to have sensitivities to sucralose or simply wish to avoid it so what is the reasoning for mentioning its inclusion only in the ingredient listing?  Reading the ingredient label searching for diet ingredients in non-diet soda is not normally a part of a soft drink purchase but I guess Ill be checking from now on. So, between the diluted taste and the buried Splenda, Ill stick with Canada Dry or TJs in the future. Both of the other brands have a much more pronounced ginger bite to their flavor.	-1
Didn't like these at all!	-1
Contains Sucralose and sugar.  I looked on the box for the word DIET but it wasn't there.  Has that awful, artificial sweetener aftertaste.  Now I'm stuck with them.  Very disappointing.	-1
Not  sure what the deal was with this product, but there was almost no taste to it at all. Might as well have just eaten paper.	-1
If you are expecting the traditional texture of a dried fruit you will be in for a surprise. These are puffy and crispy like a Puffed Cereal. The texture seems sort of incongruous with the flavors. In my office the apple was the only one that got a thumbs up. The orange is tart and had a bit of a bitter aftertaste. The pear was virtually inedible, with no pear flavor and only a dry chalky texture. Apple was acceptable, but nothing special. Perhaps a nice change from normal dried apples. All in all, not a snack I would choose to buy or eat again.	-1
they're horrible.	-1
Like far too many additives--falsely advertised & largely In-Effective, as a supplement--like far too many falsely advertised products, by pharmaceutical Companies, across the board!	-1
I didn't pay sufficient attention to the label. I'm not pleased with the artificial flavor, and I'm VERY not pleased with the inclusion of various fake sugars, including Sucralose. Will be returning.	-1
too much $$$GOD bless you and GOD BLESS AMERICA!!	-1
I can honestly say I saw ZERO improvement in my hair by adding these to my diet. They do taste nice, a typical strawberry lemonade flavor. The pills also dissolve quickly. However, you can get a biotin supplement that contains even more biotin for much cheaper at your local big box store. Having said that, it is not suggested that you consume so much biotin. Consuming this much biotin often leads to issues with cystic acne. Overall, these taste good, but that's it. I feel like I took a flavored placebo, yet I was not tricked into thinking this did anything for my hair, skin or nails.	-1
Did not care for the taste of this orange water - similar to baby aspirin -	-1
these bottles feel wimpy and i did not like the taste of the product	-1
I love the regular sparkling water without flavor; this was not tasty. I wouldn't do this again.	-1
checked expiration but i's into 2016, so the product is just no good new; slight taste of old aspartame (old bottles of old diet coke) but if you want grapefruit taste you'll have to buy one and squeeze some juice into this slightly acidic water; the lime is pretty good so who knows how they missed so badly on this one	-1
Ewww! Yuk!	-1
Dreadful taste.  not sure it tastes anything like it's supposed to.	-1
Tastes awful	-1
I was expecting more. The grapefruit is very bitter	-1
Tastes like the can. I wouldn't buy this again. The can's are tiny---pay attention there. The taste? It's got a metallic taste that really isn't very good. I drank them but no one else cared for it. I love grapefruit but this just wasn't very good.	-1
Nasty taste. I drink original Perrier all the time and love it, but they do not seem to do a very good job with their flavors (I prefer Polar flavored sparkling water).	-1
Just does not taste that good. I like grapefruit and drink other carbonated grapefruit flavored beverages.  In a pinch, or for portability this will do. But for taste, well, I'm not going to buy it again.  The lemon and lime are good. This one? Not so much.	-1
Not impressed. You can barely even taste the grapefruit, tastes like bitter Perrier. I will stick with san pellegrino.	-1
They've somehow ruined water. I didn't think it was possible. "Carbonated water with a hint of lime, that should be refreshing," I thought. Boy, was I wrong. I also found it odd that they were advertising "less minerals." It's water, give me more minerals! At least then there would be some point in drinking this crap.	-1
I loved the Nestles flavored grape and mandarin water, but, it is not available anymore, so, I thought I would try this water and it is terrible.  I prefer the non carbonated waters.	-1
Love Perrier but this lime flavor reminds me of lemon furniture polish.	-1
Thought it would taste like the "Other sparkling Mineral water"...nope. oh well	-1
Again I thought they'd be bigger... alas I was disappointed	-1
Worst water ever.	-1
did not work . to small for an adult	-1
My cat hates it, and he usually loves catnip.	-1
My dog got really sick after eating these for a day. I thought maybe it was a coincidence, gave her another yesterday, and she's acting super letharic. They seem to block her up and she'll screech out in pain for seemlingly no reason.	-1
Definitely NOT everlasting... lasted less than an hour for each of my medium sized dogs, and I had purchased the large ones. ALSO please note: STAINS ALL OVER MY CARPET!!!!! I don't know why but it's not letting me upload a picture of it.	-1
These are JUST AWFUL.  They break up into tiny pieces which are very hard, and the dog can choke on them.  THey are left with just a big mess.  I would NOT BUY These again. D:	-1
Weird smell and dog isn't loving THEM! Not worth the money	-1
Dogs will not chew it at all.	-1
Bunny will not even eat these. He is not a picky rabbit, but he stares at it and has no idea what to do with it. Perhaps too hard for rabbits.	-1
Actually, it is our 2 dogs that unfortunately hate it. I really thought they would at least like them, if not love them.  I truly am sorry that this has to be a negative review.	-1
I really love the size of these, exactly what I was needing.  But the adhesive left a rash on my skin.  I'm not particularly sensitive to bandage adhesives, though it was used on a more sensitive area.  Didn't have the same problem with other bandages though.	-1
These Band-Aids are kind of a nuisance. They stick fine and cover the cut all right, the problem is when you try to take them off, they shred and you have to pick them off in little bits. Last one was in more than a dozen pieces. Adhesive is much stronger than the material it's on. And if you use them on the bottom of your foot and you're pressing the adhesive all day long, it could take a good ten minutes to unstick all the bits.  I expected better from the brand-name bandages. Would not recommend.	-1
I am a devotee of Band-Aid bandages.  I normally purchase small packs from the local pharmacy, but in an effort to safe a few $$ I went with this box.  Boy, was I disappointed.  These seem like knock-offs.  The edges fray even before you put the bandage on, they either come off quickly or are so adhesive that they leave a layer of goop on your skin.  Once I am done with this box, and it will not be soon enough, I am back to the 30 count boxes on Main Street.	-1
100% useless. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  I wanted this to be all-that but all it is fancier Vasoline rebadged and significantly higher priced.  I washed my face for night and applied this and immediately knew this would be trouble because I barely slept all night.  Normally I use Blistex DCT and should have stuck with what works for me but I thought perhaps this would help lesson my addiction to the Blistex.  My lips were constantly bothering me all night, so much so that falling asleep and staying asleep was very difficult.  When I woke up at 2am for the 4th time, I touched my lips thinking all the 'nighttime' must have worn away for me to wake up in this much pain but it was all still there.  I'm not even sure why I bothered to stick with it all night because now I'm grumpy from lack of good night sleep.  I only wish I could return this overpriced garbage but alas, I opened and used it.  Don't make the same mistake!	-1
Not really effective	-1
I bought this because of the good reviews but my lips seem to get chapper when I use them. I like the baby lips dr. rescue a lot more. It also looks really white on your lips and make you look like you are sick	-1
I thought it was funny when the box of Band-Aids I'd ordered was at the very bottom of my Prime Pantry box, under a bunch of heavy stuff. The flimsy cardboard packaging used for Band-Aids these days was squashed absolutely flat.  I stopped laughing when I used the first Band-Aid. I don't know what the people who wrote all the glowing reviews were using, but the ones I got functioned nothing like the ones they describe.  According to the manufacturer, these Band-Aids have a "unique adhesive" and "stay in place." I don't think so.  They stop sticking to the skin when wet, but they stick so well to themselves that when you try to remove them, they stretch and tear rather than come off all at once (as any sane bandage does). I've ended up with many small, stretched and torn-away fragments trying to get one of these things off. Is this what's known as "unique adhesive"?  In between removing the bandage's wrapper and getting the thing positioned correctly, if the sticky part happens to accidentally double back on itself, you can forget about getting it loose. All it will do is stretch and tear. I have to throw these in the trash.  Once, when one of the torn-off fragments landed on my carpet -- sticky side down --  it wouldn't budge. I had to cut it from the carpet using scissors.  I've always loved the Band-Aid brand, but not anymore. I'm unable to recommend this product. Even Dollar Store bandages are better (and cheaper). I'm quite disappointed in Johnson & Johnson.	-1
Bad material	-1
Wish they had more stickum!. They have a tendency to fall off.	-1
I try and stick with organic products. This came out very clumpy and clogs the lid each time	-1
didnt taste that great to me but i know other who really like it.	-1
I just received this honey, and it's already starting to crystalize. Yuck. I hate that. Won't get again.	-1
This seems to be filtered honey and not raw.. The flavor is not there. I ordered two of the Honey raw organic wildflower honey and they sent me one of these.  Does not compare!	-1
The price is right, the taste is not. I will get the kind from Costco when I finish the bottle~	-1
My public name and my private name has always been one. If I don't live with anyone my public name is my only name. I am not in agreement with the name game	-1
has animal products (gelatin) in it. wtf????	-1
Not sure why, but these simply do not taste like or as good as the ones in the glass bottle.  Do they even sell them in the glass bottle anymore?	-1
dry perhaps.. roasted probably.. salted  not a chance.  not what i expected.  To the products credit it does not mention being salted in any obvious way.. but to amazons failure.. the description here clearly says salted.. which i cannot see, feel or taste at all.	-1
Makes my stomach ache.  They have somewhat of a strange taste.  Expiration is January 2018. Will never buy these again.	-1
These do not taste good.  Either they use old nuts, or the dry roasting process spoils the taste.	-1
The seal was broke	-1
I did not like the taste of the tea. I don't think it helped with milk production.	-1
contains palm oil, I didn't eat these i'm sorry i ordered it.	-1
It's good and all but after a few bites the darn thing has you craving sugary treats instead. Probably due to the small amount of sugar used to try and get you addicted to it, on a small level ofc. It's not working with nuts apparently.. Also thats a cheap shot way to get customers in my opinion.	-1
**ALL '3' Containers Were of the "WRONG ITEM", etc....ALL were "Roasted Peanuts"...and NONE of the '3'-Ordered...Were the "Roasted Peanuts With SEA SALT"!!!, etc...as I Ordered....& "Wanted"!!....I was..Am very Disappointed!!....and Will hve my very 1st..."RETURN"...of many, many Orders!!....driggs Kizzire, 1/17/16	-1
Rope pulled out within 5 minutes of giving it to my dog, rope shredded like it was kleenex in another 5. whoever did quality control the day this batch was made was asleep.	-1
Do not like this much -	-1
Did not care for taste	-1
This diet iced tea was a big disappointment. So many good reviews here and elsewhere convinced me to give it a try. BIG mistake! So sweet, the taste was nauseating. After the 1st bottle, I waited a few days to be fair, and tried it again. Not good. The tea flavor was overwhelmed by the artificial sweetener. However, the actual taste of the tea seemed good, so I will give the unsweetened variety a try, adding my own sweetener and lemon. Stay tuned.	-1
doesn't taste anything like peach	-1
Taste is horrible!	-1
I didn't realize that it had aspartame in it, which gave it a funny after-taste.  The kids loved it, but I won't be buying it again.	-1
This is poor quality tea, but if you are looking for that fast food restaurant quality tea, this is what you are looking for.	-1
really  no flavor to this tea...home brewed is much better!  I wouldn't buy this again.	-1
I love Kraft Mac & cheese but these did not cook up well.	-1
You would think that all Kraft Mac and Cheese was the same. It is not. This box contains 2 dry ounces LESS than the store bought one.  The box is the same size but the contents is not. Who woulda thought? The shape of the pasta makes it cook up differently too.	-1
For some reason, these pasta shapes make a fantastic product taste bad.  Never again will I purchase these; I'll stick to the elbow original.	-1
I received this in May with a sell-by or best-by date of June 7. Two or three loaves were moldy.	-1
really bad taste.	-1
This product has too many sugars per serving and leaves the protein aftertaste.  I really should have checked the sugar content before ordering. It does mix well in water or almond milk.	-1
I drink the ready made and think I am spoiled with that product. I am going to stick with the ready-made type of protein. It just tastes different. I have just been adding it to my coffee as creamer instead so I can use it up. So there is really nothing wrong with it I just prefer the premixed stuff.	-1
Gross.	-1
Too expensive	-1
nasty no flavor. i tried my best to make it taste better but these knorr sides are all horrid.	-1
Too salty!  This was ok in the flavor department, but just tasted like a salty buttery cream sauce.  It was good to mix up the usual routine.  I think next time, I would add more pasta, broccoli, and chicken (or another meat) to balance out the sauce.  I also like this with a lot of peppercorn	-1
I used this when I found myself running up against the clock and needed Mexican rice in a hurry! I didn't realize when I purchased it that it was a mixture of both rice and pasta, but I'm downrating it not for that, but because it tastes nothing like Mexican rice. It did nothing to enhance the flavor of my burritos and I won't be repurchasing this in the future, not even as a quick side dish.	-1
This was absolutely disgusting. The smell of the warmed up cheese was horrible. The taste is also bad. Never again !!	-1
Completely Smashed!!	-1
No... just........ no	-1
once again a knorr pasta that is DISGUSTING. i have tried like 10 different flavors and they consistently nasty and all have the wrong cooking times. it is always hard. my kids hate this and let me tell you red beans is their FAVORITE food.	-1
Zataran's is better. Not what I would expect from Knorr	-1
I bought this Knorr Fiesta side to have as a quick side dish with tacos.  I have to say that they had no flavor.  From now on I will stick with homemade.	-1
There are over 40 food ingredients besides "monosodium glutamate" that contain processed free glutamic acid (MSG). Each, according to the FDA, must be called by its own, unique, "common or usual name."  "Autolyzed yeast," "maltodextrin," hydrolyzed pea protein, and "sodium caseinate" are the common or usual names of some ingredients that contain MSG.  Unlike the ingredient called "monosodium glutamate," they give the consumer no clue that there is MSG in the ingredient.	-1
My baby loves this a good product and do nice I couldn't ask for a better price	-1
nasty stuff	-1
Poor quality box of salt.	-1
Just dry noodles. No meat, no sauce, no nothing. I bought these as emergency rations for the earthquake. You'd have to be desperate to eat this dreck.	-1
This is not a particularly good selection from Knorr. I like some of their side-dish offerings, but this one simply did not taste like stroganoff. I added sour cream in an attempt to create a more authentic taste, but that was just a waste of good sour cream.  The picture on the front of the package is very light cream color like Alfredo sauce, but the sauce should be a light brown. This sauce prepared is actuality it is a kind of sickly taupe/gray color which is not very appetizing. The envelope I received has a best buy date twelve months in the future.  It failed on taste and appearance, so I will definitely not buy this variety again.	-1
No flavor, just bland.	-1
Not too good	-1
Completely Smashed!!	-1
not good	-1
I prefer the taste of Rice-A-Roni rices but I've tried some Knorr noodle things and liked them as much as an other brand. However, this tasted horrid. It smelled so awful my son came into the kitchen to see what was going on. I served it up but ended up throwing the whole batch away after a only a couple bites.	-1
Just something about the taste. A tad over bearing and has an after taste. I really like most of the Knorr products, this is not one of them. Flavor is one of those things that is truly up to the individual, however my gf doesn't like it either and she normally likes the things I don't. Won't be buying this particular one again.	-1
This is really nasty rice and has no teriyaki flavor to it at all. The cooking time has to be because every time i cook these knorr sides the rice is super hard. never buying this stuff again! if i could give it zero stars i would.	-1
It tastes so not natural	-1
Did not like at all. Was not impressed and think they missed the mark.	-1
My son and I did not like this at all. It almost had a sweet taste to it.	-1
I would not buy this again. It's pretty tasteless, has no flavor and all I could taste is a spicy (hot) flavor. Nothing besides that.	-1
I bought this Knorr side dish because I have liked other Knorr products, but unfortunately this one was very below par. It states the cooking time is 10 minutes but despite following the simple directions on the pack, it took at least 15 minutes to cook properly, meaning other parts of the meal had to be kept warm and on hold while waiting for this pasta dish to cook. I have cooked for my family of 7 children for years, and feel I can make a basic pasta side dish out of a packet without any trouble.  This dish just didn't live up to expectations. It was quite bland, lacking any real cheese taste despite being a "four cheese" side meal. Disappointing.  It wasn't horrible to eat, but it wasn't anything other than just passable either. From my experience with this dish I would recommend taste testing it during the cooking and perhaps adding some extra cheese or spices to it to your liking, to give it a lift. As it stands, I don't feel I can recommend this particular Knorrs side dish to others.	-1
could not eat it,it taste so sweet	-1
The pasta does not come out well. The flavor is excellent but not the pasta fooked.	-1
These don't have the flavor I was expecting, very sweet and kinda have a twang.  Quick shipping, arrived as described, I just don't like the taste.	-1
Completely smashed!!	-1
I did not care of the flavor of these at all.  I ended up giving them away.  Bland.  More of a white sauce and not really an alfredo.	-1
It is just not my cup of tea.	-1
Tastes like clam chowder but only with chicken. Yuck. Added crackers to it to make it palatable.	-1
Not real good to me. Passable for emergency type eating.	-1
these aren't the greatest, but you can eat 'em!	-1
I'm a little leary to use, the jar top is puffed out. The expiration date is good and the seal on top is intact.	-1
The color yellow instead of white ,no good	-1
It didn't taste very good.	-1
