One of the hardest things in teaching music to kids is just getting the correct note out of whatever instrument they are playing.  Boomwhackers solve that problem.  These are extremely fun to use in a classroom setting and the students learn a lot about music, rhythm and teamwork.  The major drawback is the cost for large groups.  I think I am up to 12-14 sets of these (plus a few bass sets) for my class of 34.  Another major drawback is that the bass sets tend to crimp and once they do that, they are pretty useless.  You can cut them down to match another note so they don't just go to the landfill.	1
I bought these for a preschool percussion kit I put together (and on a recommendation as a must-have item of percussion).  I purchased the Treble Extension Set because it was cheaper than any other set I found, and I like that they're shorter than others as they're intended for 3-5 year old kids.  The sizes range from about 10-16 inches.  There really isn't much to them, and though they are different notes, there isn't really a lot of variation in the sound.  I've read about how to play the boomwhackers, and my husband and I were still unable to get a lot of sound out of them.  They're pretty flimsy plastic, the instructions actually talk about bending them back into shape after shipping, so I hope they hold up with extended use.  Advice I saw online was to not hit the floor, as it will bend and shred the ends, and not to whack hard items with the center of the whacker, as it will bend the plastic in half.  Bottom line?  You might want to know what you're doing with these, but I think that the kids are going to have a BALL making music by hitting things.	1
We got my son what we thought was a classic wooden whistle, and also this one. Boy am I glad we got this one, because the wooden ones aren't made like they used to be; the wooden one doesn't make any sound. This plastic one is easy for a little kid to blow and sounds great. Three tones, each a minor third apart. Loud enough to be fun, but not obnoxious. All aboard!	1
Bought it to complete my child's conductor costume. This whistle makes a beautiful sound, however my 2 year old cannot blow it hard enough to make it work. The whistle has been dropped on the ground and put back together with ease.  Would recommend this over a wooden whistle for children who are not careful.	1
My 20m old son's speech therapist recommended a harmonica for teaching him to blow. I also got him this as he loves trains. He actually finds it easier than the harmonica. We have fun pulling trains around the track saying "chug chug chug" and then giving a "toot toot" on this whistle. Simple, but a nice sound and it is hard to blow it too noisily!	1
I wanted to find a train whistle for a good friend of mine, who is the principal woodwind in a professional, local orchestra, because he loves model trains and has one running under his X-mas tree right now. I had the conductor's hat for him, but no whistle! This one was fun in more ways then one: it is always a good joke in my eyes to gift a toy instrument to a pro musician, and - believe it or not - this little plastic toy actually produces a very pretty tri-tone "shu-shu" sound, too cute for the money! We took it to a dinner party, and had lots of fun using it on occasion to underline some speaker's comments, much to the general enjoyment of the diners. I don't think one can have more good-natured fun - young or old - than with this little treasure!	1
The scarves are exactly what my dance group needs.  They are big enough and long enough to move freely in our praise dance.  I also like the fact that I got so many for so little money.  The texture of the scarves is much smoother than some other I have looked at. thanks.	1
Bought these to stuff in a kleenex box and they work great. I guess you could teach colors using the, but mostly they are just for fun.	1
These are great to use for a dance class for little ones! Very colorful, sheer and light. Very happy with this purchase, all of the kids love them!	1
exactly what I expected. good quality, good value.	1
Put them in an empty tissue box. Your toddler will stay busy for 30 minutes while you sip your coffee in peace. :) :) :)	1
good value for price, but not meant to be used for a long time- material is flimsy, but for 12 scarves for $6, at 50cents each, it is a bargain. Light and nice, great for scarf dancing for kids.	1
Just what my music classroom needed. Thanks!	1
great	1
Product arrived as described	1
Very big, quality scarves!	1
Great for childcare	1
Great for my seniors who dance in their chair they love the colors!	1
The children in the class loved these-they were great for movement with music, but also made capes, fairy wings, and pirate scarves!	1
My autistic son loves these. They are very well made.	1
Lots of fun!	1
The colors are vibrant. I plan to stuff them singly in colored plastic Easter eggs for my grand daughters enjoyment	1
Great addition for my daycare.	1
So many ways to use these fun scarves! Great price!	1
Not only are they great for sensory play with music and rhythm, but I was able to use one as a "ribbon" and bow for my daughters Christmas dress in a pinch.	1
Fun for my 6 year old granddaughter and her friends!	1
Children love these. I use them in Children's Choir at church and they are always asking if they can take them home.	1
My 8 month old LOVES these scarves! These are so versatile and seem pretty duarable despite being so thin. He loves when I toss them up and let them fall on him. They are great for waving around. They could even be used for dress up or an older child could learn to juggle with them. A great and inexpensive gift!	1
Great quality! I use for creative movement for kids and they love it! Will buy again!	1
we love them, great for sing-a-longs and exercises, we are now dancing with scarves	1
I teach a preschool rhythmic gymnastics class and these scarfs make class more fun.  The kids love the feel of them and they are colorful and bright.	1
The title says it all. I wanted to save some $$, but these "scarves" were just squares cut out of cheap, nylon, fine-mesh fabric. The edges are NOT hemmed. Maybe that was in the description; I don't know. I returned them.	-1
I was looking for a multi-colored, multi-purpose scarf set for my 2-year old.  These are great for him!  He wears them as pirate bandanas, dinosaur tails, or anything his little mind can imagine.  They have also helped us teach him colors.  These are unending fun!	1
My daughter was about to have her 2nd birthday and we were shopping for gift ideas. The moment she locked eyes on "bunny!" there wasn't an option to walk away without it. Bunny was an early gift because she instantly bonded with the big, cuddly, hug-able, lovable buddy of a bunny. I know it's a JackRabbit, but to my toddler it "Bunny!"  This isn't my first Folkmanis Plush Puppet, we have 5 others. The high quality, detail, longevity and charisma of the puppets make them friends for a longtime with my littles. My son was very rough with his "Wolfie" yet 6 years later Wolfie is fresh as ever. I will be honest, my daughter has jacked the jackrabbit in less than 2 months more than any of the other 5 we have. Not sure if it's the puppet itself, my daughter or what. The stuffing in the neck is nonexistent at this point, (she's hugged the stuffing flat or displaced the stuffing while dragging bunny everywhere she goes when holding/hugging bunny by the neck.) I'm only mentioning this because it's been less than 2 months of ownership, such a short period of time (especially in comparison to the others we have and the equally brutal treatment they received.) Other than the neck stuffing on the jackrabbit everything else with all our Folkmanis products are in top condition. The stuffing condition is sentimental at this point, years from now I hope she looks at bunny and continues to hug the heck out of it and remember the love and fun in the years Bunny has been around.	1
This rabbit looks like it is scowling.  I returned it and bought a different one.  It did look realistic though.	-1
Great toy for 9 months and up.  Once they can hold it in their hand and twist on their own.  The adults liked it as well!	1
Great rainmaker!	1
I'm a childcare professional and mother, this is one of my favorite toys to give new parents. The soft fall of the beads is attention getting but not annoying. I've yet to have a baby not be engaged by this toy.	1
While a rainmaker at first glance does not seem educational--- it certainly is! We used it in our daughter's music classes...purchased this one and it has brought lots of entertainment. Not only does it make a cool sound which can be used with different songs...it is also fun to get all the beads down to the very bottom of the stick!	1
Very good product ! We like very much to play with it. Lot of fun ... Thank you Very Best	1
This extension set is well worth it, for added track size and to enhance the racing experience that my Grandson has with his Carrera GO race set.	1
Grand Children loved it!!	1
Having fun with it, but I wish there were some suggested track layouts supplied.  I went to their website and you need an engineering degree to use their track design program.	1
The curves are NOT curves, but loop pieces! And not a whole loop, only half. The rest is good, they work great with our GO track!	1
9 y.o. still likes to pull this out on rainy days and add to it. Our cats like it as a hideout too.	1
It was the hit from Christmas, sure they are just kids and they can build a house out of any old box but this was so much better. Very sturdy construction, this will be around for months it can take it. Not flimsy or cheap like competition	1
LOVED by my two year old, Husband, and cat! The cat loves to scratch the corner. I would recommend and buy again.	1
We're very happy with this playhouse. It has also been therapeutic for the parents leading the efforts to color.	1
Have told all of my friends with kids to get this house! It's awesome, durable, and really easy to assemble.	1
Hours and hours of fun! Sturdy cardboard house.  Still using it a year later with my daughters friends and cousins!	1
We get these for the kids/cousins every year at the holidays.  They have lots of fun coloring the outside and playing on the inside.  If the kiddos are rough with it, it won't hold up long.  We get one at the holidays, use it for about a week, and then recycle it.  With 4 kids playing with it, it isn't completely trashed after a week.	1
My 15-18 month old used this house for a couple months. Super easy to put together, really really sturdy. He would pound on it and push it did not fall. Perfect choice for young kids opposed to tent material and pop up cars that they can push over so young. We decided to take it down after 3-4 months had a little wear towards end but he used it a ton.	1
My son loves this. I hate it because it's big and takes up space and eventually falls apart since it is essentially a card board box and he's a rough little boy but he has a blast with it it's the 2nd time he's had one first time he received as a gift second time I purchased for him. it's pricey though for something that doesn't last so I wouldn't buy it again	1
I honestly was not expecting the house to be quite this big. My two year old daughter loves it and its the perfect size for her. Well worth the cost	1
I purchased these for my 5 and 7 year old daughters (when they were that age).  Set them up in the play room in the basement and they loved them so much.  They would go from house to house and visit each other.  They could color the inside and outside.  They held up pretty well.  A good role of duct tape worked to keep them together when they were well loved.  A great toy for the price.	1
I bought this for my nieces to play in when they come to my house and they love it! They love coloring all over and it is big enough for them both to play in..and sleep in!	1
SO cute! My daughter absolutely loves this playhouse. It's large enough for me, my husband, and my two kids can all fit inside of it. My only complaint is how difficult it is to fold the house back up. Other than that, it is a fantastic product.	1
This was a great project for kids. We used it with some friends so there was a total of 6 kids coloring on it all weekend. It was sturdy enough for our purposes and well together very fast. The kids were even able to help set it up. We had ages 2-9 working on this house. They colored the inside and outside. It is a nice BIG project that can be thrown away when the fun in over! :)	1
I think $50 was overpriced for this as after entering a few times the bottom of the door was broken allowing the door to swag along with the whole playhouse, should have been constructed of a hard plastic outlining the complete house instead of 2 inch high cardboard at the opening of the door..  I had previously purchase a coloring playhouse the same size for $25 that was much better constructed and lasted for months whereas this is about to be thrown into the trash after only 10 days of use!  Needless to say I am very disappointed!!	-1
This was my 6 year old daughters favorite present and her 4 year old brothers love it too! It's well made and and I put it together within 5-10 minutes. It has two sets of each picture (2 kittens, 2 puppies, 2 doorbells, etc.) on the house which prevented so many arguments about who could color which picture. The amount of pictures this house has to color is surprising and my kids love finding all of them. One side note which I feel is very minor, the washable markers came right off of a rug since I wiped it with water as soon as it happened but it did take a few baths to come off of skin. This is still the favorite present after a week and has entertained them for hours at a time....so it's my favorite present also!	1
My Grandchildren LOVED this - kept it up for months and continued to embellish it and enjoy their new 'fort'.  It is inexpensive enough that you don't feel bad about tossing it when it has outlived it's interest.  I plan to order another style for next Christmas	1
My son really like it!	1
Really loving the playhouse right about now.  My 2.5 year old son has been abusing it since it showed up at our house last week, and it is standing strong.  It is a lot sturdier than you'd think it would be!  When the delivery arrived, I was shocked to see just how large it was when unfolded!  The rooftop comes up to my shoulders, and I stand at 5'5"!  It has more than enough room for my two year old, and should he ever invite any friends over, would have more than enough space for them too!  There are two doors, which is nice, so that while someone comes in one door, there is an out at the other side of the house.  Because the cardboard is so sturdy, I found that when releasing the windows and doors from their openings, I had to use a sharp knife to loosen them for fear I'd tear the door.  It took nothing at all to set up, maybe 10 minutes or so, and that was with a two year old running in and out of the partially finished house! Great playroom house for kiddos!	1
Fun for all three grandchildren ...keeps them well entertained and they get along so well while coloring in their own spaces their own way	1
This was the perfect thing to keep six 3 year olds busy at a birthday party. It was easy to assemble, and the kids loved it!	1
love it	1
This is such a fantastic product.  Rough and tumble kids - be wary.  This house IS made of cardboard and some caution must be used while playing in/around it.  Having said that, my 4.5 yr old daughter and 1.5 yr old son L O V E this house.  We've been coloring it for a month -- it's BIG enough for me and my kids to all sit comfortably inside, or the neighbors to come over and play "house" or "hide and seek".  I bought a Dollar Store Tap Light and Command Picture Hanger to hang inside, so the kids can play in it at all hours.  It currently sits in my living room -- takes up a lot of space!  It is continuing to hold strong and I would definitely purchase this product again.	1
A month+ later and we still have this in the living room. I tried to put it up and my son followed me pointing at the door begging for his house. They have colored all over it. One thing we did was tape the seams to reinforce them because our kids are really rough on stuff. We also taped it to the floor because it was sliding around. I feel like this is one of the better gifts we have given the kids for many reasons, first it encourages imaginative play, secondly they have decorated it so they have a sense of pride and ownership in it, lastly I feel like this allows me to have more free time because they will play together in this play house and let me cook, read that sort of thing. Another plus into a pretty slim profile for storage.	1
Oh my..My 2 year old and 4 year old grandsons loved this thing and played with it for months, and it was always the center of their play activities when friends would show up to play.  Hours and hours a day they'd play in and out of the Cottage.. coloring, drawing, and going crazy. Awesome product.	1
This is awesome for my 3.5 year old who likes to play house, but after a few hours of play the base of the door (landing on the floor) tore. It still is a great item just wish the cardboard on the bottom of door areas were stronger.	1
Such an entertaining piece to have in your home!  My 5 year old daughter and 3 year old son loved this!  It's so big that it does take awhile to color, which I like (kept it entertaining).  Very detailed with the opening window and door and cute chimney.  I would just advise that it doesn't seem to do well being taken apart and put back together often (our house is small so we would put this away as needed).  Every time we'd get it back out things seemed just a little harder to fit back into place.  I would get this again but leave it up always.  Kids enjoyed it, especially when friends came over.	1
Hours and days of fun. I have two boys ages 4 and almost 2 and my 4 year old, who is tall, can stand up inside. IT IS BIG!! But they have slowly moved some toys into it and at night they take flashlights in (it's pretty dark inside, even in the daylight). They colored both the inside and the outside and, if you have the space, I CANNOT recommend this enough! Especially if you live in a place where there is a long winter like me ;)	1
Needed something to pacify a room full of kids between cake, presents and swimming. This was  a hit! Everyone loved it and it held up with a room full of hyped up little ones from 1 to 8 years old.	1
This house is huge!!! My 3 year old could fit in here with 3 friends and stand up. It was SUPER easy to put together and is my son's favorite toy at the moment. Its well work every penny.	1
Used these at my baby's 1st birthday party which was also a 70th celebraton for my aunt.  Kept the children occupied and away from the adult festivities all day!  Was super sturdy.  Lasted the entire day with about 10 kids using it.  Gave it to my next door neighbors and they had it i their yard for about a week until it got rained on.	1
Bought for my 4 year old niece. Chrissy was put on hold today so construction was complete on her new house... It went up fast and easy. She loves this house it was a perfect gift for a little girl that has a lot of toys. Glad I stumbled on this purchase it was a great investment!!!!	1
Good	1
She Loved it! Decorating it and then playing in it.	1
My daughter is loving the house. She plays and paints it day by day. It is cardboard but it's thick so it should last her for long. Certainly a good product	1
Love this! Pretty sturdy it's still standing after a month of my 3 yr old knocking it over all the time. He plays pretty rough. The pictures are really cute too.	1
Ordered to keep kids busy at a party and it definitely did the trick.	1
I bought this for my grandson who is 6. He has almost finished coloring this house. He really enjoyed it. One thing, the house is really large; so you need a big space to keep it when being used. Good seller with prompt delivery. I would recommend this to my friends and family.	1
This was the second time I bought this product my family loves it so much	1
Great	1
huge house	1
HUGE.. we didn't read the demensions and when we set this up it was huge. Has a door, mail slot and window and each long side and a window on each short side. I love that you can fold it up cause its so big. However it isn't that sturdy. I have a 4 year old and year old and it's already ripped in a few places. It said to tape it for added protection but that didn't help too much. There is no way to attach the chimneys on top. They just rest on the roof. It's fun and my kids love it but I know it won't last long	1
Excellent, well made, easy to set up and big enough for 3 kids. 2 doors. definitely a winner	1
This is much sturdier than I thought it would be so I decided to paint it and customize it for my granddaughter. I wallpapered one inside wall with gift wrap, added a paper fireplace, home sweet home picture & a tv with her favorite show printed on it. She & her friends love it. The oldest is 8 & even my daughter-in-law can move around in this playhouse very easily.	1
Wonderful item! I'm not sure if the kids or the adults are having the most fun!	1
As far as I'm concerned, this is the best $30 I ever spent. My four year old daughter loves playing in it and spent lots of time coloring it. She can use her imagination thru pretend play and be creative all at the same time. Easy to put together too. Even if it doesn't last very long (although it seems pretty sturdy) it was well worth the money for a great Christmas present.	1
Amazing product.  Kids played with this for days upon receiving.  Came in great condition and was really easy to set up.  WIll be buying more of these as gifts in the future!	1
This is well made, durable easy to set up, and it has two door ways and postal boxes which are perfect for our two children.  It is extremely easy to fold up and store under our bed for storage.  The illustration provide a great activity for kids to draw, color and place stickers on.  It really does keep them busy for hours.  It easily fits 2 adults and 2 small children.  We take it out for rainy or snowy days.  The dimensions folded down to approximately 35 inches by 20 inches by 4 inches.  They are always excited when we take out of the house for them.  Its lasted weekly play for almost 9 months.	1
What a great little house. Directions included! Direction also printed on underside of roof, a real asset when setting the house up. It was easy to assemble and much bigger than expected. A nice sturdy house for the money. Kids have even slept in it. Makes a nice place for play, resting or reading. Bonus markers included.  It was a nice family project.	1
Easy to put together; days and days of coloring and a ton of fun for my 4 and 2 year olds playing inside.  Best money spent on a toy so far - both my husband and I agree.  It is LARGE - with a door and window on each side - so needs plenty of space.  Totally worth it - we are moving and may buy a second one!	1
Simple to put together.  Sturdy - very large.  Endless hours of fun.  The markers seem to last, but I bought a 120 set of crayons along with this gift.  I'd buy this again and again.	1
great house. Hours of fun	1
SUPER CUTE!  Lots of Summer fun, and I think we can add large brown cardboard Gingerbread Men for the Holidays!	1
..you are buying hours of play for kids, and more freedom for yourself;) My 3 and 1 year old loved to play with big boxes but they were to small for 2 kids. This house is perfect, even parent can fit inside. Pretend and play in full bloom. Great part- it folds very easily for storage, and making custom painting fun also for parents.  I'm so glad I had a Amazon Warehouse deal (returned item, almost like new) for $25 with shipping. I think this price would be fair, not more. After all you are buying a cardboard;)	1
As with anything, kids lose interest. When I first put this up they were all over it. I have a 2 yr old and 6 yr old. ALOT of coloring work!! neither of them had the patiences to color everything so we got one side completed. its pretty sturdy but pretty large too. Took up alot of room in our basement playroom. For the first week they played inside of it and moved a chair and table in it but now it just sits there in the corner taking up space. I think all in all its a good play house for the price. If you have 1-4 yr olds it should be a hit...but maybe not very long, so I wouldnt buy one that is too expensive.	1
My daughter had one a few years ago and when we moved I got rid of it. She begged and begged for one this past Christmas and was so happy when she opened it on Christmas morning. It isn't small but we had room for it in our family room and her & her friends think it is so fun to play in and color (and apparently 6 nine year old little girls can fit inside but not sure how comfortable that was), mainly it seems to be an awesome place to hang out and play minecraft	1
I got this for my 5 year old daughter, who gets bored quickly. This one was huge hit. She spent the first 3 days just coloring it ( and it was only 30% done...Its that huge) She was so engrossed i had to bring food to her play room :-) 2 weeks later she is still coloring it and it still holds her attention , which is a huge plus. She has organized all her bday gifts inside "her" house. Its roomy enough to fit 4 , 5 year olds easily and adults as well. Love the window Overall , its a wonderful product.	1
We love this house!  Its sturdy, easy to assemble, and did not require tape or anything extra to hold together.  We used crayons to decorate (because I don't want my 3 year old loose with markers) but the markers work great and we used them for another project.  The only recommendation I have, is double check that you have to room inside for this, it seemed bigger than I anticipated.  Our playroom is large so it didn't matter.  This was a hit!	1
I would buy it again..... Easy to put together, pretty durable. Let's face it, your child will end up breaking it somehow, on purpose or not! But it's cardboard.....just tape it!! My two and a half year old son moved all his favorite belongings into his new clubhouse, he even has a LED lantern for night time!! Pretty cute :) I recommend this house.......	1
My kids played with this for hours every day for a week straight.  Once colored it is still a fun playhouse for them.  They love the mail slot and pretending to deliver mail.  And if it's junk mail or a bill they throw it back out the window.  So much fun for them to pretend!  Good quality and easy to fold up and get out of the way.  Sets back up in under a minute once you get the hang of it.  Only complaint is the door thresholds which are a skinny 2" piece of cardboard at the bottom which promptly gets torn off when you have two kids running in and out of the house.  Could have been reinforced better or designed differently.  You don't really need the piece at the bottom of the door, but the house does become less stable and the walls tend to slide outward more often when the door threshold is no longer in place.	1
This is better than a refrigerator box by far. My daughter is 1-years-old and is not yet ready for that leap of imagination, but is ready to do a little imaginative play. I put her little kitchen unit in there with some pillows and things. She loves to play in there with her friends during play dates and they get giddy popping their heads out of the doors, windows, and surprising each other. We're a little rough on it. I've duct-taped it vulnerable areas with pretty-colored duct tape, it was a bit dark inside, so I put some LED fairy lights in it, and I've made some other modifications ... skylight, keyhole for pretending to unlock the door, shutter tiebacks with ribbon ... what's really nice? You can do that with this. It's cardboard. You can do anything to it you can imagine! It has been stickered, colored, fallen on and it is incredibly fun. For the price? You cannot beat this as a fantastic foray into imaginative play.	1
It does seem pretty durable, and my daughter likes to color.  I like the variety of designs to color on the sides.  But, do measure how big your space is before ordering.  We did not realize how much space it took up!  We did use this as a house for "Santa's" presents, which was a big hit.	1
This house is a great idea but poorly made. A complete waste of money. Thr house collapsed a few hours after my daughters started using it. Could not get it to stand back up. Too much trouble to ship it back for a refund.	-1
I ordered this playhouse for my autistic grandson's 5th birthday because he likes to be in small spaces.  The packaging was ingenious and it went together very easily - only two tabs hold the whole thing together.  I reinforced all  the seams with packaging tape.  The first day, we were in love.  The second day, he started diving out the windows.  The third day, he had reduced it to a pile of rubble.  Granted, he is much harder on toys than other children might be and he doesn't understand how to restrain his impulses, but unless your child is quite docile, the house probably won't hold up.  We'll go back to looking for big cardboard boxes for him.  Oh so much cheaper, and they last longer.	-1
You can get it at bed, bath, and beyond for 19.99!  If you get their coupon in the mail it is even cheaper!	1
I bought this exact same cardboard house for $20 last year & it was worth that price.  It arrived folded up & took me about 15 min. to follow directions & assemble it.  It's larger than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise. I originally was going to put it in the child's bedroom but it didn't fit with the bed in the way.  So I had to put it in our finished basement/gameroom.  Still, it was quite popular for about 6 months.  Several children ages 3 through 14 loved coloring it, laughing & playing & little ones ages 3 through 6 loved walking in & out the doors, peeking out through the windows, putting papers "mail" through the mail slots next to the doors, sitting & lying down inside it. The house can fit 4 little kids standing or 2 older kids sitting down. Even I can crawl inside & sit down (& sort of lie down) (I'm 5'2"). You will need to buy at least 20 good quality markers. We had large Crayola markers that worked well. In retrospect, construction paper or paint should have been used to paint the roof: that takes up a lot of marker to fill up.  This house inspired a lot of creativity.  The older kids doodled pictures on the roof since it wasn't completely colored.  Some kids put stickers on it too, but the stickers eventually fell off & stuck to our wood floor, so I don't recommend that.  I never unfolded it: I left it together which meant it took up some space, but that was ok.  All of the printed drawings on this house are darling & exactly as shown in this picture. It's repeated on the back & other side of the house.  There are 2 large windows, 2 little windows, 2 doors, & 2 chimneys.  The chimneys sit on the roof & fall off when the house is moved. The rest of the house stays together.  The inside of the house is plain so it wasn't colored by anyone.  At the time, I was thinking of drawing pictures for them to color.  Now that the house is completely colored & slightly crushed from kids leaning on it, it's ignored. The inside of the house is plain, which is good because I plan to disassemble this & recycle it to use the blank parts of the thin white cardboard... when I think of something creative.  I think this house would still be played with if they could color it all over again or if it were in a carpeted room where little ones could play inside longer.  I'd like to buy another one so I have it on my wish list, although I'm hoping to find it at a cheaper price.  This time, I won't be letting any kids color it as I'll be using it as a puppet playhouse both here at home as well as on stage for occasional childrens church puppet shows.  (I'll be the only one coloring it... which will only work if none of the kids discover it or if I buy another one for them to color again).	1
This is a fantastic idea!  Kids love playing in forts, houses, etc that are all their own.  This combines that love with the love of coloring that most children have.  It makes for a great activity for a party or sleepover too!  The playhouse is solidly constructed and pretty durable.  I highly recommend it!	1
The kids loved it and spent many days coloring it all over.  My son took naps in it and wanted to sleep all night in it.  They really got a kick out of helping build their own house.  Quite a cool thing, Bravofun! arranged for fast shipping.	1
My daughter loves this. We'll sit inside together, because it is so big, and draw furnature on the inside. Her eyes lit up when she saw this. I recommend this because it is a good price compared to the plastic little tikes houses ranging from 300-400 some odd dollars. It won't last forever being that it is cardboard but so far I have gotten more than my moneys out of it.	1
This house was much bigger than I thought it was. I have two granddaughters (ages 17 months and 2 and one half).  They absolutely loved it. We had so much fun drawing and coloring and making new things inside the house.  What a wonderful idea!  The designs are adorable and it exceeded my expectations.	1
First, the not so great:  LOL - okay, so I read in some of the reviews that this thing is big, but I thought, "It couldn't be that big."  Um...I was wrong.  This house is huge!  First and foremost, make sure you've got room for it.  My daughter is a tall 2-year-old.  It could fit six 2-year-olds with room leftover.  It takes up a ton of space.  And, since it's cardboard, it's not feasable to keep it outside.  In addition, like some of the other reviewers, I did need to use some packing tape on the roof to keep it closed and stable.  Since I had to do that, the fact that you can collapse and store it becomes a moot point.  I'd have to remove all the packing tape each time.  The markers that come with the box dry out really quick.  Finally, the shipping seems expensive until you note the size and the weight of the box.  Now, the great things about it:  The quality of the house is amazing.  This is durable, cute and my daughter loves it.  It seems like it will stand up to a lot of play.  The illustrations are adorable and begging to be colored.  When my daughter realized she could color her house, her face lit up.  It's easy to put together.  If you can put together a gift box, you can do this.  It took me about 5 minutes flat to put it together and that was with my daughter insisting on helping!  All in all, a really nice play house.  Just make sure you've got the room for it!	1
We bought this item for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas.  It turned out to be her favorite thing that day, and is still her favorite thing by far.  She loves being able to color it and really loves having "her own house."  I love it's low price for the amount of fun we've already gotten out of it, and I like how compact it folds up for storage, though we do mostly just let her keep it out.  It's surprisingly durable and LARGE!  You really can't go wrong with this.  I'm sure we'll even end up buying more of these when my second daughter gets a bit older and wants one of her own to color.  Oh, and the markers that it comes with work very well to color large spaces; perfect for the job.	1
We purchased this for our daughter for Christmas. It's a very fun, affordable house (got free shipping through Target), but beware of the size. The box in which it was delivered was fairy small, but when we set it up, it was larger than the plastic playhouse we have outside!! The kids love coloring it and peeking out the windows and doors. Since it is cardboard, I don't expect it to last forever, but when it's ready to go, we can recycle it!	1
Grandma got this for my 3 yr old son and he was instantly in love! Put together in minutes, he played in it all day! Will fold down flat again for storage and easy transport home - a big plus as we have 700 miles to go. Lots of fun details like working mail slot, dormer windows and more than big enough for an adult [my husband is 6'4" and fit inside with our 3 yr old] and child to play side-by-side. No staples to scratch children.	1
Santa has yet to deliver it to the kids but the packaging was very sturdy and it arrived quickly.  We can't wait to get it set up.  2/27/10 -- easy easy easy to set up and kids are still loving it unlike the other things santa got that have ended up on a shelf.	1
My then 3.5 & 1.5 year-old boys played with this house for MANY hours for about a year before I finally disassembled it.  It stood up to some pretty rough playing with multiple 4-yr-olds pulling it in different directions. But after about a year, it began to tear.  I plan to buy another one. Definitely worth every penny!	1
I got this for my four year old for Christmas last year.  It was really nice looking.  We put it up and it lasted all of a few minutes before it fell apart.  Where the doors are is a very thin piece of cardboard and it came apart very easily.  After opening the doors a couple of times the house fell apart!  Then it was no good of course.  NOT worth the money we paid for it and my daughter was heart broken because she was really looking forward to playing with it.	-1
Product as described. I recommend this seller.	1
Good addition to the collection.	1
Very quick shipping. Great product.	1
Great fine awesome details	1
The figure is too big for other figures of the same universe. But it seems very durable and has good details too.	1
Works great for extending the Carrera track set. This allows my husband and little guy to create a much bigger track with more straight sections so there are less burnouts.	1
I bought this as an extension to the set. It is a Xmas gift..	1
It came and some of the wood is warped which I suppose may straighten out once I get it together but the hardware kit (10 screws and allen wrench) did not come in the box.  I have a very disappointed little girl on my hands and for the kind of money I shelled out for a doll house I shouldn't need to research and hunt around to find the correct hardware.  !00% dissatisfied.	-1
I love the simple wood construction of the dollhouse. The plain wood is really an asset, as I can see us decorating it once my daughter has had it awhile and decides how she wants it to be. The rooms are easily accessible and its fun for her to move the furniture and people around. Putting it on a low table helps though so its more at eye level (we don't have the extra downstairs room). Generally good construction and easy to assemble. The downstairs walls are a bit flimsy since they don't really snap into the floor, but so far it hasn't been a problem. Enjoy!	1
This was a Christmas present from Papa and Gramma for my 2 boys ages 4 1/2 and 3.  It went together very easy. Solid support structure. Tool came with for assembly. Clean, smooth, I like that it is not finished with paint or stain.  Accessible from 3 sides, and that is my only complaint. I wish we had gotten the other Ryan's Room house that you can access on all 4 sides. The middle rooms in this house can only be accessed through the front, so when my 2 boys try to play together, they both wrestle for the prime play spot. But when it's only one playing...no issues at all.  We use a train table (now too small for their massive train track creations) to put the house on, easier access and everything is at eye level.  The balcony doesn't really attach that well, kinda loose and wiggly, and it's kinda difficult to access the top middle floor with it on. So we just use it for a side yard, deck, and just propped it up on a book.	1
We received this doll house as a present for our four year old daughter and she loved it from the start - huge wow factor on Christmas morning as I had set it up the night before. Assembly was super easy - it only took about 30 minutes including inventory and reading the instructions. The construction around the frame is very good to excellent; however, I felt the inner walls of the doll house are under supported. The front ends of the walls are not supported and free to sway left/right. This is not a big deal for a four year old, but we also have a toddler and I am concerned that the walls may not hold up if he gets aggressive with the house - he has already tried to sit in the house once. I would note that the description says the house is two story and this is accurate - this includes the attic story (there is one user supplied picture that has an extra base floor that this unit does not have). the doll house is very open and my kids have been able to reach in and play with toys in all the rooms with ease. Lastly, the roof has a built-in handle design - this is very very useful for moving the doll house from room to room.	1
We absolutely love this dollhouse! We purchased it specifically because it was wooden and it did not have any embelishments on it. I wanted my kids to be able to use their imaginations as to the lay out of the house and change it up if they wanted to; no predetermined kitchen, bath, etc. We outfitted it with Plan Toys dolls and furniture and it works just great. We also bought the basement. Altogether, it is quite large. This is definitely a toy that is going to go the distance.	1
This is the one toy my children never get bored with. We used a combination of Ryan's Room and Plan toys for furniture, and used calico critters for the "dolls". I bought some light wood colored shelf liner to give them hard wood floors and added some white textured wallpaper. I also ended up cutting some felt and pasting it down to some thin board for removable carpeting. It was pretty easy to put together. It is kinda dark, I'd like to install some dollhouse lights if I ever get brave enough to drill holes in it.	1
We love this house, it's very neutral and so different. A child can access in on both sides or the front. It is huge, we have furniture for each section and it occupies kids for hours upon hours. It is perhaps the most sturdy dollhouse we looked at, in tip top shape after 4 years. The Plan toys one is pretty sturdy but I liked the more traditional design of this one. We have the garage piece at the bottom, which is perfect with it. The top comes apart from the bottom for easy transport. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone that's looking for one.	1
I bought this for my daughter who will be three just before Christmas. I'm sure she will love it. The furniture sets for it are very solid, adorable and should last a long time. The main wooden dollhouse itself is very sturdy, but the interior walls that slide in are very flimsy and I'm concerned about how they are going to hold up. The front window sits out fromt the top, and I agree with a previous reviewer that one good direct hit to it will most likely break it. I have two older boys who are a bit rough with toys, so I'm a bit worried. However, it is a nice sized dollhouse and I'm sure my daughter will love it. It was also pretty simple to put together. Update: I've found it's helpful if you can put this house on a short sturdy table, like a train table. It's difficult to reach the middle, bottom section on this house and the basement addition as the house is so deep. You have to get on your belly on the floor! I do love this house, though. Very well-made with nice attention to detail. The sliding doors are cute. My daughter enjoys playing with it and loves all the little furniture sets. December 10, 2012. update: house is still in great shape and has held up well! So far so good...	1
My son recieved this light as a gift and it broke with in 30 days. I actually don't think it worked correctly from the beggining but it is hard to say becuase there was little to no instructions. Made very cheaply. Not worht the $50 it is sold for here on Amazon!	-1
Great light! Much better then I expected. We use this as a prop for out RC racing track. We NASCAR the whole thing up. LOL It's a little larger then the 1 10th trucks we race. Really nice and works great. We needed something that takes batteries and this fits the bill. Well built out of the UK. directions are in German, but it's intuitive. It has two full light sets and two cross/ don't cross lights. They all work in sinc.	1
Very cool visual aid for my lesson.	1
Just recently got this but works great and the kids love it.	1
My grandsons play with their ride-in cars and bikes and love this!!  It operates without them having to get off their bikes to change the lights and the light and pedestrian lights are highly visible.  The only downside is that it is VERY small and I wish this manufacturer offered this product in larger sizes.	1
I use to have to fight my children for the broom but now that they have their own they can sweep when I sweep. It lets them "help", develops gross motor skills and they are learning important life skills.	1
This little broom set is all your toddler needs to have fun "cleaning" too! It's made well, and you can't beat the cost!	1
Now the grown-ups can sweep too  - since we have our big broom set back !!! Love the mini set. The colors are great for a young boy.	1
This jumper kit is a "must have" for any electronics hobbyist or student. I built hundreds of circuit boards with pieces of wire everywhere. You could barely distinguish which wire went where. With this wire set, my projects are neater, cleaner, and well organized. I love this jumper kit.	1
Awesome product	1
Good price for jumpers.	1
good	1
Would have liked more color choices but other than that...	1
I bought this to use in a high school robotics class and it ws perfect for our work with Arduino and Cubloc PLCs and breadboards.	1
They work.  Not sure what else to say...  I wish amazon allowed "stars" without comments.	1
I have no idea what this is used for, but my grandson had it on his Christmas wish list and was thrilled to receive it. He is into robotics and told me that it was "great". High praise from a 14 year old!	1
Just as good as can be.	1
Nothing special. Packed very well and accurate diameters all pieces. Quantity was enough. I was satisfied with this quality but it would be better with lower price.	1
This is a decent breadboard and looks like it will hold up to some occasional hobby work.  I bought this one to replace one that I bought from a business that was going out of business back in the early 90's.  They had used my old one for several years before I bought it, so it's at least 25 years old.  The only reason I'm replacing it is because it was stored in a shed for a while and got wet, rusty, and all around nasty looking from the leaky roof and elements.  So, compared to my old one, this thing looks and feels like a toy.  That being said though, compared to my 1990 Honda Civic, my 2012 Civic feels cheaper and cost twice as much.... so I guess that's how things go.  The metal on the back of this thing is not very thick.  When you stick the little rubber feet on, I suggest going it about 1.5 inches from each corner, don't stick them way out on the corners.  I think that will help it feel more stable.  They could have added two more of the feet to help with any "sagging" in the middle as well.  The posts are definitely cheap.  They feel like cheap brittle, and very thin, plastic.  I don't use them a lot, so maybe they will last.  If not, they are easy enough to change out with some better ones.  I haven't used the actual breadboards a lot but they seem to be the standard internet quality.  There again, they don't compare to my old unit.  All in all, I'll keep it, and I'll use it as one of my primary breadboards for prototyping.  I think for what it is, it was a little over priced at about $35 though.  Not so overpriced I would return it, and I'm not sure there is really anything better here, just more sizes of the same thing.  It doesn't compare to my old one, but not many things compare to their older counterparts.  I am recently getting back into the hobby and finding this to be the case with a lot of stuff.	1
What can I say because there is nothing to say but it works very well for my projects and seems to be very well built. I think it will last a very long time. I love it! Up date: I have been working with this bread board and it works even better than I thought it would. I have built several projects with it and there is enough room to leave your favorite project in place while you build another one. I also purchased another one of these boards because I am using them for Christmas this year for a led display. I used a 555 timer IC and a 4017 IC to build a led light display over the fire place and everyone who sees it loves it and wants me to build them one LOL anyway you will love this Bread Board it is huge!	1
The campus bookstore wanted an outrageous amount for something half this size. The breadboard is big and it works great. The pieces can be removed and they are interlocking, so you can create different configurations. It helps if you have some thick foam tape or something else to mount them on if you're going to remove them, though, since the interlocking tabs aren't really sufficient by themselves to hold them together.	1
Little breadboards of various sizes make things modular .. nice when needed. A giant play space is nice to have around for .. playing.	1
Purchased this breadboard as a hobbyist expanding my knowledge in electronics.  The board itself is nicely sized (large), and allows for pretty decent sized circuits to be constructed.  Basically, it is 4 standard breadboards side by side, with an additional bus strip run horizontally on the top, all connected to a solid backing.  4 binding posts allow for additional external components to be connected.  It looks like it should last quite a while if treated well.  The jumper wires are of a very wide length of sizes, and allow for easy color coding when working in complex circuit prototyping.  The box the come in (clear instead of the blue shown) allowed for easy organizing of the different sizes.  Overall, it's a pretty good combo, and reasonably priced for the size of board you get.  Other than that, it's not too complicated of an item, so there's not really much else to say.  2 Thumbs up!	1
These two Items are I "must have" for any electronics major or hobbyist. I do not regret purchasing these items.	1
Jumpers and breadboard are really cool.	1
As advertised.	1
Great kit for the next step beyond the little hobby bread boards you get with a lot of Arduino/Raspberry PI and electronics starter kits.	1
My first breadboard. Im very happy with it	1
Terrific value at the price I paid.  Incredibly useful for sussing out design ideas.	1
Absolutely worth every cent. First of all, this is a really nice big size, so largely projects have room to spread out a little, or two small projects can run at the same time.  It is mostly a high quality board, too, although the bolt-on terminals feel a bit cheap.  The jumper-wire kit is well made, too. It contains a nice mix of wire lengths to make even the tedious point-to-point chip jumps easy.  The only issue, and it is quite a minor one, is that there are power runs between each row of sockets, so it is not possible to make a simple connection between rows, such as using a driver chip connected to an LED bar graph. It is possible to jumpers across the power run and make it work, but it requires setting up extra jumpers. If the power runs aligned with the other sockets it would be possible to skips this, but the power run sockets are not matched up.  Otherwise it is a good board and well worth it.	1
Breadboards are the corner stone of electronics prototyping. This particular model is one of the largest you will be able to find for a good price, and you really want to go as big as you can even if the project you have in mind is pretty small. You don't want to get a new idea further down the road and realize you don't have a big enough board, or maybe you don't want to take apart a previous project.  A nice feature of this particular one is that along the top is two bus bars, which allows you to have two different voltages. Very handy for designs where you have a voltage regulator to power your logic, but still need the higher voltage for operating things like motors, relays, etc.  The packed in jumper wire set is also a really nice to have. Cutting and stripping your own wire works fine too, and is cheaper, but it is also time consuming. The set features many different lengths that fit perfectly, for example connecting a row to the bus bar.  Packaged with it is the four terminals for connecting to bench top power supplies (or threading in wire from say a battery). The terminals need to be installed yourself and you'll need a small socket or wrench to secure them down tightly. In addition it comes with four stick on rubber feet to keep the base of the board off your table, but more importantly to keep the metal from the nuts on the terminals from touching the table.  I have nothing to complain about mine, I'm glad I bought it.	1
Very good product, ideal for electronic applications.	1
Great!!!, excelent!!, 100%	1
The item arrived in time and I was pleased with it.  There were some small issues,however.  The top left corner was bent when it arrived (only in the far corner, not alot of it bent,but still) and the binding posts don't have the best hold, but overall I would still recommend it	1
We are using this 365 piece resistor set to augment the parts that came with the "Elenco 300-in-One Elecronic Project Lab". This set has a great selection of resistors and come packaged in labeled baggies for easy location of the needed value. Each resistor is also marked using the standard "BBROYGBVGW" color code and the few I have tested with an ohm meter are easily within tolerance.  Overall I am very happy with this set of resistors.  Highly Recommended!  CFH	1
They're resistors. It's always nice to have a bunch of spares around for prototyping, and they're labelled. Several values are grouped together into the same bag, though, so you still need to learn to read resistor codes if you hope to find exactly the value you're looking for.	1
It seems like whenever I need a resistor I don't have the right one. This selection helps out, and at a price of under $10 it was a no-brainer.	1
Its carbon, what detail do you want..	1
I could not resist it ,good value	1
Great varitey of resistors.  Now I won't have to worry about some odd ball resistor value again. I thought my parts bins had it all but I was wrong	1
Don't waste you money buying components for your hobby projects on amazon! :) (sorry amazon) - use futurlec, sparkfun, jameco etc. this box was relatively cheap so got it anyways!	1
Excelente...	1
Arrived on time. Works as advertised.	1
Very good product, ideal for electronic applications.	1
This is a great set. I especially like how the resistors are placed into separate bags making it easy to find the one you want	1
Arrived on time and as described. Many different values of resistors come in the assortment. All resistors are sorted and labeled in bags for easy identification. Approximately 4 different values in each bag all sequentially sorted (1ohm 1.2ohm 1.5ohm 1.8ohm in bag one; 2.2ohm 2.7ohm 3.3ohm 3.9ohm in bag two; etc). All are 1/2W which is nicer than 1/4W because it can dissipate more heat before failing	1
Right price for the great selection of resistors. 1/10th the'radio shack price and more than half the price of the local electronics store.  Just the ability to pick and choose what resistors at any moment was great fun.	1
These resistors come pre-sorted, but each baggie contains five or six values. If you don't already know the resistor colour code, you'll have to learn it.  They all seem to work, I haven't had one that didn't meet my specifications yet.	1
A Very nice assortment of electrical goodies for the errly learner to discover electricity and how it works..All low voltage and harmless but really educational!	1
Yes!	1
Purchased for my grandson who is into robotics. He was thrilled with all the bits and pieces and will surely put them to good use. I recommend this product for anyone who is more 'techy' than I am.	1
i bought this kit to experiment with a few circuits and to have extra parts for building circuits/ adding onto circuits for my HO layout.	1
My grandsons love their Go slot car set.  They can wear out a set of contact brushes in one weekend playing with it for hours at a time.  I needed spares to keep them racing.  Theses brushes appear to be identical to the original brushes that came with the cars and wear at the same rate as the originals.  They are easy to install and come with spare king pins.  Don't be caught without them.	1
Grand Children loved it!!	1
just as described. haven't had to use them since the race set came with extras in the box.	1
Such a beautiful kite!  I have always loved kites since I was a little kid.  Now in my senior years and so glad this kite is easy to fly!	1
Got this kite after getting really irritated by the crappy plastic variety. Flies easily in very light wind as long as it's also a steady breeze. The string holder is a circular ring which is the best design I've ever dealt with for kite string. Easy to let out line and easy for a child to hold. Line is strong.	1
<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Butterfly-Single-Line-Kite/dp/B0002HLCBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Butterfly Single Line Kite</a>&nbsp;This is the best Kite ever! The fabric is excellent and the size is perfect. The print and colors are  art worthy. It comes with plenty of line and the proportion of the body and the tail is perfect. Very aerodynamic. It was a hit as a birthday present for a 7 year old girl. The 9 year old boys and girls and the adults were very pleased with it as well. It handles very well for the experienced kite flyers as well as the novices.	1
It was missing a pole when we opened it so I used a pole out of another kite we have but we could NEVER get it off the ground no matter how hard we tried.	-1
I don't know what it would take to get this kite to fly, but apparently wind isn't it.	-1
Doesn't fly! Poor design!	-1
Super kite nice quality easy to fly and put together allot of fun	1
Fly's easy and is better than anything we have bought at any big box store	1
Great kite, when you tug the string it makes the wings flap like a butterfly. Only drawback you can't do other tricks like diving.	1
Ravensburger Puzzles are the cream of the crop in the puzzle industry.  The pieces are quality and the designs are worth framing when you finish putting them together.  I have several of these puzzles that I have glued together and framed to hang around the house.  This is the one thing that everyone heads to when coming to visit.  I always have a puzzle going on my dining table and everyone will just take a gander then see what they can put together.  It's a great family project where you can spend some quality time together.  Well worth the $$ for something that is made with pride and thought of with family values in mind.	1
Not much one can say about a puzzle, if you think about it. I mean, you've got the image, the quality, and the level of difficulty - and a lot of that is subjective.  In this case, I really like the image - I don't often do black and white photos, so this was a nice switch, and the content is quite nice as well.  As for quality - it's great. The reproduction is excellent, and the quality of the puzzle pieces themselves is also great. Clean cuts, thick, sturdy pieces - I have no complaints.  Finally, difficulty. It's not easy. Lots of grey sections mean there's a bit of frustration for those that cant keep their cool, but that just makes the whole thing that much more satisfying. There's enough variation in the edges to get going, so that's good as well.  Overall - I'd recommend it to someone looking for a tough puzzle to stay busy with, and that values quality of product. A great puzzle.	1
I have always been a fan of Ravensburger puzzles, and this new 1000 piece puzzle continues Ravensburger's trend as the leader in high quality high piece puzzle sets. This particular puzzle is extremely difficult to put together and I must say the difficulty lead to a very satisfying feeling upon completion. Since the puzzle is in black and white and the pieces are relatively small, I would definitely only recommend this puzzle to those with a great deal of patience who truly enjoy putting puzzles together. Overall though, very high quality and a great buy for puzzle enthusiasts of all ages.	1
I am impulsive & impatient. My wife is patient, deliberate, cautious. I often "check her pulse" as my way of teasing her to see if she has any life in her. She never is much amused by that after over 30 years either by the way....But she did a terrible thing to me. She wrecked my brand new little Fiat 500 Convertible on the freeway after I had only driven the thing 3 times. So when I saw this puzzle, I thought, REVENGE!    Now, my wife has done these puzzles for years. When she goes to Oregon to visit family on vacation she does them. See what I mean? BORING! I was hoping the black & white thing with this puzzle would throw her, upset her, make HER get mad. Well we are over a week in and she is still working on it. Me? Yeah right....I wouldn't touch anything like this. Would probably DIE from boredom OR have a complete nervous breakdown. just not my thing. Burt while I am retired, my wife works so has just limited time. But every minute she can, there she is, stubbornly & doggedly messing with this thing. I also found out she cheats with this just like she cheats on playing Monopoly. She takes all the square edged pieces first to go the outside borders. Then she works her way IN. I never heard of that so I have to assume she is cheating? Anyway, she just smiles and says it doesn't bother her that this is hard.    So in the past couple weeks of my planned revenge, I seem to have instead, given the old bat something to do that relaxes her. I can't win, no matter what I do. Seems that things that drive ME crazy make her relax. And that drives me crazy!!!!!!Oh, but one little thing that got her kind of upset (yay!), was that there is a blue backing that sort of comes off a bit on her tablecloth. That is about all I have gotten out of all this. She says it is an amazing puzzle because it is so difficult unlike her others so she keeps thanking me. Says she also loves the way the pieces are cut and that it is much thicker & better quality than her other puzzles. Oh and it gets worse. She says even the shapes are different & more irregular than usual puzzles which adds even more of a FUN challenge for her. I just can't win........	1
Both my uncle and my father were in the construction industry in NYC/Brooklyn in the 1930's-40's. When I saw this, I remembered the stories I used to hear about how they would dangle from beams on the skyscraper construction. This puzzle is unique that it is in black and white (which is a new, unique challenge for me) and at the same time educational/inspirational for people of all ages. To see how our ancestors had to build the skyscrapers that we all take for granted today, before all the safety precautions of today, is eye-opening. I love puzzles and try to complete one every month or two. I am hooked on black and white now as it brings a whole new dimension to trying to match and fit pieces. I highly recommend this for everyone.	1
Always loved this when I saw a poster of this- and a local restaurant has a full size scultpture that's amazing- now isn't It lucky that dh loves to do jigsaw puzzles and then glues them together? YEP! But the "gift" for him and get to keep it for me!- Ravensburger Puzzles are extremely well-made!	1
This is a really historic puzzle I am putting it together now very difficult since it's black-and-white but I'm sure it's going to come out beautiful I've already purchased a frame to put it in	1
I think this is my first Ravensburger puzzle,,,,and what "quaility"!!! I do alot of puzzles and can usually put together a 1000 piece 1 in about 2 or 3 days! This 1 took me 12 days,and what fun :) I do love the way they use linen in their pieces,and found it quite nice. Not for the beginner for sure,but if you want a challenge,this one is for you! Would recomend to anyone looking for a good fun puzzle!!!	1
If you loves doing puzzles, this is a great brand to buy.  Each time we have purchased one, we have loved the sturdiness of the pieces and that they were clean cut.  I am not a fan of opening a puzzle box to find thin flimsy pieces that are poorly cut.  Each piece fit wonderfully in its place without the  "maybe it could go here" kind of questions.  Also, the scene was a challenge while not being impossible.	1
My family prides itself in putting together a puzzle, any puzzle in one sitting.  We may be up all night and tag each other in every once in a while, but it always gets done.  Not this puzzle, it is the single hardest puzzle we have ever tried to put together.  After the first night trying to put it together, we got the edge done and not much else.  With most puzzle, we resigned the trial and error method of just trying every piece until one fits until we start on the sky, but thanks to the black and while color scheme and the primitive photography it is based on (do not expect high details), it was almost an entire puzzle of sky split into three sections, the actual sky, the buildings below, and the men on the beam.  It ended up taking about two months for me to finish.  Difficulty aside, this is a very well made puzzle, the pieces are thick and the image stays on the piece, of the 1000, I only had one edge flip up.  And it is pretty clear when two pieces do not fit together.  If you are looking for a puzzle with a very high level of difficulty, this is a puzzle for you, but beginners and novices should stay away.	1
We are a holiday-time puzzle family.  We always bring one to the beach, and we do one over Christmas break & one over Thanksgiving.  We LOVE Ravensburger puzzles!  And this one does not disappoint.  Like all Ravensburgers, the pieces are well cut, with a good fit and a smooth sturdy feel.  We found this little devil to be especially challenging!  It's 1000 pieces, and it's not just B&W, it's many many shades of gray.  It took us over a week to finish.  But we did it, which felt great, and we enjoyed it except for when we wanted to beat our heads against the wall.  BOTTOM LINE: Great brand, great puzzle, but no walk in the park.	1
For the most part, this is a well-made puzzle. Even though the pieces were handled gently by an adult, there were still a couple of pieces whose ends bent a bit. The pieces fit together nicely and there's no mistaking a wrong piece in the wrong place. The scene is black and white and looks more difficult than it is. There are buildings, streets, and people throughout, and the girder and rope get you off to a good start. The blue backing on the pieces makes it easy to get them all on the image side from the beginning.  Having not done a puzzle in quite a while, it was nice to remember just how relaxing puzzles can be. Listen to some music and let your mind wander. But don't dwell too much on those guys suspended a billion stories over the city or it may not be as relaxing as you'd like.	1
I enjoyed putting this puzzle together with a mixed group of people. It gave 5 of us time without distracting electronic communication of any sort and allowed us to talk about a range of topics related to this iconic picture. It was only the second puzzle I had put together in 20 years or so, the most recently being a few weeks ago. That one was a mystical/fantasy image, and I found it a lot less absorbing than this one. It's funny how a simple, low tech, activity like this can be a lot more fun than other things we waste our time on.  Ravensburger does seem to make better puzzles than other companies out there.	1
My father and my wife and obsessed with puzzles.  In fact, most of our family vacations consist of my mother and I trying desperately to peel my wife and father away from the living room table and their spread of intricate pieces so that we can actually do something with them.  So, against my better judgment, I decided to get this puzzle.  It just looked like a fun challenge for them.  I mean, it is basically one solid color (with lots of subtle variants) and so I knew it would keep them consumed.  Needless to say, they LOVE this, my father especially.  I love the photo.  It has such a crisp and nostalgic feel to it, and I love the vintage allure, but this is all about the challenge and it certainly poses a great one.  The quality here is impeccable.  The pieces are perfectly made, expertly cut and they make for a unified complete product.  They fit together with ease, no gaps or squeezes to be found.  In all honesty, I'm not sure I'd buy another brand now that I've seen how superior Ravensburger puzzles really are.	1
Is this a silly review title? Nah. Right off, this was one tough puzzle to complete, and I had to beg help from a variety of friends/family. Needless to say, I suppose, I was new at putting these incredibly well cut/colored tiles, or pieces, together. Not any longer, though. This puzzle really put me through the fires of hell. But I've emerged more knowledgeable - about puzzles anyway - and a bit more qualified for the next one I choose to do. This is a nicely put together, but difficult to complete, black and white puzzle by Ravensburger. Not a toy! How could I have been challenged by a mere toy. A good endeavor to tax your brain, and even make a friend or two with.	1
I LOVE Ravensburger puzzles -- pieces are thick and sturdy and the picture is often educational.  This picture is that famous 1932 photo of men eating lunch on a skyscraper beam in New York City. My kids thought it was fake, so we enjoyed looking up the historical photos and information about the original photo. They were amazed!	1
My family has always enjoyed puzzles and we are beyond pleased with this one! Absolutely no complaints on quality. The pieces fit together ideally, smooth, not too tight, not too loose. The image quality is beautiful, not fuzzy like other puzzles I've seen. What a great piece of art for a puzzle too..the many, many shades of gray lend to a very challenging and satisfying puzzle! This one will fill many hours or evenings, so clear a good space to keep this one out. Fun, fun, fun! I will certainly be seeking out more premium Ravensburger puzzles in the future!	1
My family always has a jigsaw puzzle going and we are big a fans of Ravensburger brand. We have done at least 15 of them over the last 6 months and usually pick their more colorful scene puzzles. This one is basically gray, but when it became available in the Amazon Vine program, decided it was a good chance to try a different style. We love the actual picture - historic and interesting. And yes --- we did find the basic-gray color scheme to be a challenge. It took us much longer to finish and sometimes fitting 3 pieces in a sitting was our definition of success. Still, it was fun and once done, we have passed it on the friends.  Comments on Ravensburger puzzles in general: the interlocking pieces are sturdy and a bit thicker than some cheaper brands. Though not inexpensive, you get what you pay for and our being able to pass these on to friends with confidence that the puzzle pieces are in great condition after being assembled once is important to us. There is a wide variety of scenes to choose from in all sizes. For people who need even bigger pieces, their 300 and 500 piece puzzles with large pieces are terrific.  I recommend Ravensburger jigsaw puzzles in general and for people wanting a family challenge, this specific puzzle is a good choice.	1
I haven't done a puzzle in ages! I loved this one! We had a great time putting it together as a family. I love the photo too. All the pieces were there.. easily snaps together. It took a few hours to put together, but we just rolled it up in a puzzle keeper mat when we weren't working on it. This would be great for a rainy weekend, or just to leave out on the coffee table when friends come over.	1
I was looking for a challenge for my 85 year old father. Yes, a challenge. He is the king of all jigsaw puzzles and amazing to watch. In his own words, Ravensburger is his "brand of choice". There is nothing worse than wasting your time on a puzzle when the pieces don't fit. Ravensburger pieces are quality with clear cut edges that fit tightly! He has even glued and framed several for family and friends!  He has thoroughly enjoyed building this puzzle and looks forward to the next one!	1
This is a great puzzle company that makes good puzzles with good quality. The puzzle pieces fit together well, they are sufficiently difficult, and the image quality is pretty good for the price. This is worth the slight price premium that you will pay over a "drug store" clearance item for 5 or 10 bucks. The image isn't super clear, but isn't pixelated or super grainy like other puzzles. It has a good mix of image quality, puzzle piece "stiffness" without being too pricey. This is a difficult combination and they have done it. Buy with confidence.	1
Our family enjoys jigsaw puzzles and some of the nicest available are from Ravensburger.  As with all of their toys, this puzzle is exceptionally well made.  The pieces are sturdy, not flimsy.  The pictures are always interesting.  If you like puzzles, I'd highly recommend this one and any other made by this fantastic company.  I've never been disappointed by any of their merchandise.  Provides hours of fun.	1
Ravensburger makes some excellent paper puzzles.  This one is no exception.  There isn't a whole lot to write about jigsaw puzzles aside from quality of image and construction.  The pieces are cut cleanly.  None of them were stuck together (i.e., not cut apart) in the box.  They fit together without any inordinate difficulty.  (No, you're not going to be using your fist to pound them into position.)  The image quality is good.  The assembled puzzle presents a vertigo-inducing photo of blue collar workers at lunch on high steel.  Not somewhere you'd ever catch me!  Our daughters found it amazing to see them suspended high above the city in a pre-OSHA era, with no safety harnesses or other devices to keep them from falling.  Brave men.  In all, a worthwhile puzzle with enough pieces to be challenging for a family for an afternoon.	1
Oh, my aching eyes.  This monochromatic puzzle was a challenge. It took me a few days of hunting and piecing together before I finished. Totally fun.  I have several Ravensburger puzzles; their quality is better than any other brand I've bought. The pieces are well cut and the cardboard is sturdy enough to withstand some pressure without bending or creasing. They're the only brand I buy, both for my child and myself. Recommended.	1
Enjoyed working this puzzle as a family.	1
Puzzle was big format and easy to do	1
I have done a number of the 300 piece large format Ravensburger puzzles and one 500 piece prior to this puzzle.  Some of the 300 piece are easier than others depending on the picture but usually go smoothly and have taken me between two to four days to finish one if I work on it for an hour or two a day - lots of fun.  The 500 piece (Rooftop Garden) was more difficult and took me a few days longer but was not really frustrating. This puzzle (Window Buddies) was very difficult for me.  In all, it took me almost a month to finish it.  I did stop at one point in frustration and complete a 300 piece and then went back to it. It is high quality like all Ravensburger puzzles and a nice picture when finished.  If you want a challenging large format puzzle, this would be it; or, it could just be me.  However, if you like a puzzle that is easier, go for a 300 piece.  It is personal preference. I have deducted one star because, like the other 500 piece I have done, some of the pieces are misleading as to where they belong.  This is not the case with the 300 piece puzzles which are more accurate to place.	1

This is our 5th Ravensburger. Excellent quality & fun pictures every time.	1
Big thick pieces and not hard to do. No regrets!	1
Fast delivery. Pleased. Will use again	1
I've been doing these Ravensburger large piece puzzles for a while now and they are the best puzzles I've ever done.  There are no weird shaped pieces ... and the pieces are easy to pick up, excellent quality.  I've been doing at least a puzzle a week for several months.  When I get done with 3 of them I pack them up and send them to a friend in NY.  When she gets done she passes them to her sister.  And when she gets done they go to a church charity. We all love these puzzles.	1
Great puzzle.  The quality they say it is.	1
Great puzzle	1
My gradddaughter has yet to get this one, but we know she will love it as much as the other Tolo First Friends toys we have gotten her.  We bought it early for her 2nd birthday.  It will be nice for her to have a safe toy car that works with the dollhouse we got her for Christmas.  Now she will have something to push around too instead of taking her brother's trains.	1
This is a very engaging and entertaining toy, an ideal first car for every kid. It has been very carefully designed to act like a real car and will be easily your kid's first friend. Features: - Honk button on steering wheel. - Front lights turn on and off with music. - Car starts and sounds just like a real car ignition. - Cool driver which is removable and a great toy to play with. - Press the driver and the car honks, starts, blinks lights, and then runs for about 5 ft. - Handle at the back. - Bright colors which make it very attractive.  This car works lot better on hard floor than on soft areas like carpets, rugs etc. since the button beneath the driver eat becomes a bit less responsive. If you place it on a hard surface, it works pretty well.  Overall a great toy or gift for any kid!	1
We gave this to our son for his 1st bday and he loves it.  He pushes it around making vroom sounds.  The figure is also a hit.  He plays with it and puts it in the car to push.  The one negative is that the sound effects are way too loud and the laugh at the end sounds demented.  My husband disabled the speaker so only the lights flash and the engine sounds work.  We decided that the toy is better without them and just removed the batteries.  It doesn't need the sounds or movement to be a great toy.  Still giving 5 stars.  We have a lot of Tolo at our house and they are all quality toys.	1
This toy is in desperate need of a quieter setting. It took me a couple of days to put the batteries in it, and during that time my son loved playing with it. Once I installed the batteries and turned it on though, the sound the car made was so loud and startling that my 13M old son cried.  He now plays with this much less, and never with the sounds on.	-1
My daughter got this as a gift over 5 years ago and it has been played with hard by her and now her brother it takes a beating and is very fun.  This is something that is still out even though all the other little kids toys are packed away.  The car skids off down the hallway and then stops and giggles, they love it.	1
My little one loves cars but being very young still matchbox cars are out of the question. This one is big and chunky enough for baby to handle yet still light enough for baby to carry around on his own. It is durable since it has been dropped from the couch, chair and from a standing position and still in one piece. I would recommend this to others.	1
With so many toddler toys still having weak areas, it's nice to see something built for how a kid actually plays.  My daughter has dropped it, sat on it, stopped it from moving and it still works.  This car is not some light flimsy toy but feels very solid.  There is the option to turn off the sound, lights, and movement of the car.  It does only have one volume setting though.  My daughter likes to play with the little guy that rides in the car as well as the car itself. I like that when the car does move that she (or me) doesn't have to chase it very far.  The only thing that didn't really appeal was the strange "laughter" after the car stops moving.  It's just a creepy kind of laugh to me and my daughter is more interested in hearing the car rev up, lights flash and then see it move. The laughter part she had to get used to as it actually scared her and made her run away the first few times. She usually isn't afraid of much either.  Overall, if you are buying for a toddler that likes cars and needs a solid built one, this is a good bet.  My daughter has been playing with it every day and it has become one of her favorites.	1
I've been looking for quite awhile for a simple, solidly built little car created specifically for toddlers.  The Tolo First Friends Car is perfect, and it's the first toy my grandson seeks out while visiting.  His little fingers can easily grasp the back spoiler bar, either to push the car along or carry it around.  At this young age, a toy car has to take lots of abuse.  This one holds up well to banging, dropping, sitting on, etc.  At first I thought boredom would surely set in quickly, but I was wrong.  It did my heart good to see old-fashioned pretend play is alive and well.  My grandson especially loves the cute little driver.  He fidgets with his moveable arms, legs, head and hat (I think just to hear the ratchety-ratch noise they make) before ultimately putting him back into the carseat.  He has learned that if the driver is put down in the seat hard enough, the car will rev up, blink its headlights, honk and take off.  Fortunately, it does not take off too far...just far enough for crawlers or toddlers to retrieve.  Whoever thought of adding silly giggling to the mix was a genius.  Everyone who hears it smiles or laughs along.  This is the first Tolo toy we have owned because they are expensive.  However, after seeing how durable this toy car is and how much play time it gets, I may have to look for more First Friends to keep the car driver company.  I think this toy is best suited for kids on the younger side of the suggested age range (1-5 yrs).  Five year olds would definitely want a more sophisticated vehicle.	1
I love puzzles and this one did not disappoint me. It was a definite challenge and worth all the time I put into making it whole. The quality of the puzzle pieces is superb and the image was fantastic. This is the first Ravensburger Puzzle I've put together, and I would love to own a more. If you like a challenge, then this puzzle is for you!	1
My family puts together about a puzzle a year.  What better way to spend a winter's afternoon -- or month, as it usually turns out -- than setting up the card table and piecing together a jigsaw?  We generally use cheap puzzles from Walmart or Target or Toys R Us, so it was interesting to give Ravensburger a try at long last (even if it's no longer winter!).  This turned out to be a very impressive puzzle, well constructed, finely cut, and vividly printed.  More than that, it's also challenging, with plenty of patches of trees or mountains or sky to frustrate and delight even the most seasoned puzzlers.  I look forward to finishing this, pasting it together and mounting it, and moving on to other Ravensburger puzzles.	1
It's been a very long time since I last worked on a puzzle. Years, at least. Decades? Possibly. So as a result this puzzle is a bit of a challenge to me. 1,000 pieces, lots of blue, lots of green, very Germanic. Like, REALLY Germanic. I kept getting the impression that if I tried to put it together wrong, serious men in black coats would show up at my front door at night.  But though it's been a challenge, and though after a couple days of working on it with a friend it STILL isn't finished, it's been a very fun challenge. The puzzle itself just looks lovely. The pieces are all very durable, the printing is bright and clear and the picture on the front does an excellent job of illustrating the finished product, except for the lower right-hand corner, where part of the forest area is covered by a little banner.  Really, I can't think of a single complaint I have about this, aside from that minor one about the banner. This is a good, well-made puzzle and I look forward to finishing it and moving onto the next one from this company!	1
After just finishing a puzzle best described as "frustrating" (randomly shaped pieces that don't match well with adjacent pieces, photo that doesn't match the actual puzzle, etc.), getting this puzzle from Ravensburger was like a breath of fresh air.  When you open the box, you find the pieces contained in a plastic bag, along with a booklet that shows other Ravensburger puzzles. Opening the bag resulted in more cardboard dust than I was expecting, but it didn't create a cloud of dust or anything like that. Considering the trip the puzzle probably took from the point of manufacturing, it's probably a good thing that the bag kept the pieces from being jostled any more than they were.  The first thing you notice about the pieces themselves is the blue felt-like backing on them. This is the first Ravensburger puzzle I've assembled, so I don't know if this is a signature attribute exclusive to this company, but it's a nice touch.  My first step with any puzzle is to sort out the edge pieces. This puzzle is also predominantly blue and green, so while I was doing the sorting, I also sorted the sky and mountain pieces to make it easier to find them later. I was impressed with the quality of the cuts on the pieces, and only about five pairs of pieces were still joined together (they were cut fully, but must not have come loose during the separation process).  In contrast to the Korean-made puzzle (of Mount Rushmore, no less), the pieces of this puzzle fit together well, and they are cut in such a way as to keep each other together instead of just fitting next to each other with no mechanical connection. Also in contrast to the aforementioned puzzle, the photo on the box actually seems to match the one used for the puzzle pieces, which was welcome!  I was surprised by just how fast this puzzle is going together. I'm not finished yet, but I found it easy to find matching patterns and shapes, which makes it rewarding to work on. However, there is enough detail in this photo that I don't think finishing it in one sitting is possible, so you don't have to worry about it being too easy.  Based on this experience, I would be very willing to purchase other Ravensburger puzzles. I had the chance to request the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Neuschwanstein-Castle-2000-PiecePanorama-XXL-Puzzle/dp/B006OZJWY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Neuschwanstein Castle 2000 PiecePanorama XXL Puzzle</a>, and I regret not doing so. If you have the floor or table space for it, I think it would be fun to assemble.  I recommend this puzzle as something that is enjoyable to work with, and even kids can join in, making for a family activity that doesn't involve technology. As a technically oriented person myself, I enjoy "unplugging" and working on something that is tactical, visual, and non-electronic. Putting together puzzles is a great way to relax, switch gears, and do something with others or alone.	1
This is a really beautiful puzzle, but it is far from easy.  We worked on it at a leisurely pace over the course of about a month, with some very frustrating patches.  The border was easy enough to construct, but the vast blue area at the top and the green area along the bottom made for some difficult work.  The only hints to help you in the search are very slight variations in the hues of each color.  The castle itself came together relatively quickly.  I love Germany, and the Neuschwanstein Castle is one of my favorite attractions in the country.  This puzzle makes for a beautiful pictoral represention.  My plan is to apply some puzzle glue and frame it like a poster.  So in short, I highly recommend the puzzle, but would caution that you be prepared for some complicated work.	1
How cool is it that as I was assembling this puzzle, my husband has locked up the TV doing a DVR recording of a show called, "The Alps from the Air". So what a treat it was to be working on this puzzle while watching a segment on the actual castle... an amazing piece of architecture and history tucked away in the Alps!  As with other Ravensburger products (and puzzles) the quality is great. The pieces are solid and easy to grip, the printing is clean and easy to see and compare to the picture on the box and the pieces stay together well. The trees and blue sky are a mild mind killer, difficult to sort so a challenge to assemble - but one piece at a time, very doable. I remember doing a puzzle once that was only the face of a black cat. All you could do was pick out the eyes and some whiskers. All the rest were just plain black pieces. Now that was a killer puzzle and makes this look like a walk in the park!  Well made, interesting to assemble and a fun weekend project.	1
If you are looking for a challenging puzzle than look no further.  I absolutely love Ravensburger puzzles not only because they are challenging and make you think but also for the wonderful quality.  The colors are bright and vivid thus making your work so much more precious when you finally finish and see the end result.  I am partial to the 1000 pc puzzles and like the 27x20 size as it fits on my card table without a problem.  Preciously cut pieces make this alot easier when getting deeply into a specific color.  All in all you get what you pay for and these are the best in my book.  Now that I've been up in the clouds with a beautiful castle it's time to try a waterfall on for size.	1
1000 Pieces!  What a way to spend your afternoons... for the next ten years!  Actually, I finished this puzzle in 4 days.  The pic is a breath taking vista and the pieces were perfectly cut, fitting the abutting pieces flawlessly.  Ravenburger is a company hat knows their stuff!  Everything I've seen from them so far is of the utmost highest quality material and build. They care and it shows in their products.  No frayed ends, no splitting.  I'll never get my puzzles from anywhere else!	1
Wow. You can see online that the picture is beautiful, so never mind that. The puzzle pieces are well-crafted, solid, and fit together nicely. This was our first Ravensburger puzzle, but it's not likely to be our last; we couldn't be happier with the quality.	1
This is a really good puzzle.  I love the background.  The forrest and snowcap mountains are brutally difficult though.  I had a few pieces that seemed like they fit in multiple spots, which was painful.  This could have been my fault though since I was not working in good light.	1
I'm not much into puzzles, but I've been wanting to try some decent ones for quite some time. Ever since reading Death Note and seeing Near's blank white puzzle, that's what I wanted to try. But I figured, "Let's try something easier first. At least something with pictures." So that's why I ordered this puzzle.  It's got the image of the very familiar Neuschwanstein (or the "Disney castle"), and the brilliant colors make the pieces a wee bit easier to find. But man, I didn't know the pieces would be so small! I realize it's to conserve table space and make the puzzle more challenging, but it's quite a shock for someone so new to puzzles, like me.  It was a joy to build, though it probably took me longer than it would've others. I've already two more Ravensburger puzzles, and yes, one is blank!	1
This was our first purchase from this puzzle brand and the quality is amazing! Not really any glare and the pieces are high quality!	1
I have put together a number Ravensburger jigsaw puzzles and have come to expect high quality from this company. I just completed this Neuschwanstein Castle puzzle and it lives up to my expectations. The colors are bright, the pieces are sturdy and the finished picture is very pretty. The main reason I give this puzzle 4* instead of 5* is price. You do get what you pay for, but still, Ravensburger puzzles are a bit pricey for most people.	1
This is a beautiful puzzle.  I love the blue backing on the pieces --which makes them easier to find when they're dropped on the floor.  The pieces are small as one would expect.  I like the variety of colors in this picture.  My husband visited Neuschwanstein 10 years ago, so I thought he would enjoy this puzzle.  As soon as I saw these pieces, though, I have to admit that I realized that I prefer 500 piece puzzles at this stage in my life.  I have 3 children and I'm pretty busy.  I like to be able to sit down for a few minutes and find a piece or two that I can put in pretty quickly.  With a 1000 piece puzzle, that is hard to do.  It's a lot easier to feel successful at a 500 piece puzzle.  I think 500 pieces will probably be the largest that my children are able to tackle for several years as well.  There's a really big jump down in piece size from the 500 piece puzzles to the 1000 piece puzzles.  Still, this is a beautiful puzzle for adult puzzlers!	1
To help one of my kid's concentration in school, we began focusing on reading, puzzles, Legos, and outdoor activities, at the expense of video games and TV. This Ravensburger puzzle is of great quality, and has a beautiful shot of the famous Neuschwannstein Castle in southern Bavaria - Germany. I would recommend getting a big table that is not used for other activities for at least a few days, if not weeks. In our case, we have a large table in the basement for Puzzles, rather than starting it in our Dining Room. The top area of the puzzle is probably the hardest - as it concerns the sky. If you are new to puzzles, I would not venture out to more than 1,000 pieces at first.	1
I like Ravensburger puzzles. The pieces are sturdy and fit together well. Also, pieces that aren't supposed to go together, do not fit together well. There's no confusion or the need for serious contemplation to determine if pieces are in the right place or not. The beautiful picture is bright and colorful, but with a matte finish so glare from overhead lights is not a problem.  This particular scene was a fun one for our family. The castle was the first part we put together because it was the easiest. I thought the big patch of sky in the middle would be hard, but there was enough color variation that it wasn't very difficult. The trees were the biggest challenge. Although they are broken up by the castle, they account for close to half the puzzle and it was challenging to match the shades of green and yellowleaves to the correct tree. We spent almost a week doing this puzzle, but I was the only one seriously dedicated to it and I spent about an hour a day. I enjoy putting puzzles together and this is a good one.	1
I fell in love with the Ravensburger brand while living in Germany a decade ago. If you're an avid puzzle fan looking for a challenging, high-quality puzzle you should look no further than a Ravensburger. If you're one who loves to put them together for permanent display they are both well made and gorgeous.  I never did make it to Neuschwanstein while I was living in Germany but it's best known to most Americans as the castle that inspired Disney's famous castle. Putting this puzzle together was fun but really difficult. After four weeks of working on it a little every day I finally got stuck and decided to put it away for this winter. (Summer just doesn't feel like the right time to be sitting indoors working a puzzle lol). I never thought sky would kick my butt so much!  If you're in the market for a challenging and beautiful puzzle I highly recommend this one!	1
I got this though the Amazon Vine program for review.  This was a very high quality puzzle that was fun to put together.  Compared to other puzzles that I have done this one has a larger number of pieces that are different shapes, this is a wonderful thing because it means pieces only go together one way and this makes the puzzle much less frustrating to put together.  I recently did a puzzle where many of the pieces fit together even if they were the wrong pieces; this was very frustrating in solid color regions of the puzzle...it really drove home how important the need for lots of unique shapes for the pieces is.  The castle portion of the puzzle was a lot of fun to put together, as were the mountains.  The sky, clouds, and forest parts of the puzzle were much more difficult and took a lot of time.  As such I would recommend this puzzle for intermediate to advanced puzzlers.  It you are a beginning puzzler expect to spend large portions of time putting together those regions of the puzzle.  All in all a very high quality puzzle, me and my family had a lot of fun putting it together.  Ravensburger makes great puzzles and, like all of their puzzles, this one comes with a certificate of authenticity/manufacture.	1
We thoroughly enjoyed putting this puzzle together, and appreciated the attractive (and sentimental) design, which made the 1000 pieces come together without too much frustration.  It's not the easiest design with quite a bit of similar looking sky.  It's kinda big, with each piece being generously sized.  As for the SoftClick "technology", the pieces are very thick, but they didn't seem to interlock or hold together in a special way--in fact, several of the connections were loose and somewhat sloppy.  Also a few of the pieces were a bit damaged by twisting in the box.  Nothing bad, but nothing exceptional--note pretty much every puzzle I've ever assembled is a Ravensberger (one of the benefits of a German upbringing), so I may be spoiled.  All in all the puzzle was amazing, similar to the Ravensburger puzzles I assembled 30 years ago without "SoftClick".	1
This Ravensburg Neuschwanstein Castle puzzle is really fun to put together.  It has nice bright colors and the pieces are durable enough that one is comfortable working with them. Ravensburg puzzles are glare-free and made so no two pieces are cut exactly the same.  Very challenging, but a wonderful way to build patience.	1
Sat down for a few weekends to do this puzzle and while I have not yet finished this, I am overwhelmingly thrilled with this puzzle. I have spent a good amount of time in Rec Centers or Community Centers with children and the elderly doing puzzles of various kinds, and I prefer Ravensburger to any other brand available. The pieces fit together with a satisfying pop that lets you know you're on the right track. I've never had a piece missing or a misprint from them.  I love the surface texture of the pieces, and feel that if you wanted to preserve or frame the puzzle when completed, it would look decent. That's not my thing, but I think the texture that Ravensburger provides would look better than most flat, glossy puzzles.  Great for older kids who have the patience and the summer free to work on it, but I wouldn't set a younger one down with this for an afternoon and expect anything productive to happen.	1
My granddaughter and I did this in about three weeks (we were in no hurry).  The picture is moderately difficult for a child and engaging for an adult.  The pieces are good quality and hold together tightly.  I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and will be ordering more form this company.	1
I hadn't put together a large puzzle like this in nearly two decades so I thought it time to give it a go again.  I thought this a justifiably challenging puzzle for someone like myself and it has a beautiful scene to boot.  I don't remember ever having a Ravensburger puzzle before and was anxious to see what the rave was about, and if all their claims were, in fact, accurate.  I cleared the dining room table to begin and brought out a large glass pane from a poster frame that I had stashed.  After opening and dumping the pieces out of their plastic bags, I saw that I barely had enough room to assemble this 27" x 20" puzzle. Though there was some dust from the puzzle pieces, it was not as bad as I remembered from the puzzles I'd had in the past.  The pieces are made of nice, thick cardboard and fit very closely into their mates so there is little chance of a mistake.  I began with the "easy" part, the outside border of the picture, moved on to the castle, spending a few hours of a few days to a week on it, then had only the myriad of sky and forest pieces remaining.  I am still working on this, as well as is anyone else that walks by my challenge.  Of notable interest, my inspiration of using the poster frame glass came in handy as a family dinner came up during the assembly process and it made it MUCH easier to transfer the assembled part to a (double-wide) folding table.  I highly recommend this, or something similar, unless you have a place that you can leave it for the time it may take to complete the puzzle.  This is a very well made puzzle and is challenging, but not so much so that it's discouraging to those that enjoy puzzles. The picture is high-quality and accurate to the one on the front of the box (for reference).  I'm glad I didn't go for the 2000 piece puzzle this time, but perhaps I'll feel up to that challenge in the future.  I already have another waiting when I finish this one, so I do recommend these to the puzzle-lovers out there, without hesitation.  Step away from your electronic media and enjoy!	1
--------------------------------------------------------------- Neuschwanstein Castle 1000 Piece Puzzle (Ravensberger) --------------------------------------------------------------- I chose this 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle - a dramatic photograph of Neuschwanstein castle, an ornate modern (19th Century) Bavarian edifice, because it had a lot of distinct elements in the picture, and I thought these divisions would make it easier to complete as a family project. Boy, was I surprised!  Turns out this is a pretty challenging puzzle: the forest trees, blue-grey mountains and cloud-flecked blue sky that frame the castle are all filled with a lot of *very* similar pieces. True, the castle was fun to complete, but then everyone else abandoned the project leaving me alone to painstakingly fill it in one piece at a time... It's great!  Vexing and fun at the same time. Recommended for those who like a challege. (DJ Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)	1
This is a good quality puzzle. The pieces are thick and durable; not a single one bent while we were completing the puzzle. The picture is attractive. There are some areas of varying difficulty in the puzzle. The castle is relatively easy, while the forest is a bit harder, and the mountains and sky are even harder. The sky is colored in varying shades of blue, so even that is doable without too much randomly placing of identical-looking blue pieces to see if they fit -- the hue and shape of the pieces give some clues.	1
Ravensburger is by far my favorite manufacturer of puzzles. And what I like most - apart from the outstanding quality of the puzzles - is the variety. They make puzzles in a variety of shapes and sizes. They make puzzles that are titanic projects (you can get even get a 32,000 Keith Haring puzzle that is so immense it comes with its own hand truck), but also make some really nice small puzzles. I especially love their 500 piece puzzles. They don't take much time, but they provide a lot of entertainment. This is important to me because I have a cat who likes to bat the pieces around, so I like puzzles I can finish rather quickly.  But when I have a bit more time, the 1,000 piece puzzles can also be a ton of fun. This particular puzzle is an especially nice one. I have a preference for scenes of castles and other historic buildings. Ravensburger actually has a 2,000 piece puzzle of the Neuschwanstein Castle (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Neuschwanstein-Castle-2000-PiecePanorama-XXL-Puzzle/dp/B006OZJWY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Neuschwanstein Castle 2000 PiecePanorama XXL Puzzle</a>) that shows a winter scene in widescreen panorama.  So, another outstanding puzzle by what is clearly the best mass manufacturer of jigsaw puzzles in the world.	1
The Neuschwanstein Castle puzzle is a pretty difficult puzzle.  The bulk of the pieces are all within specific areas on the picture and can be easily confused with another piece of similar color.  Personally I think this adds to the challenge and enjoyment of it, lending itself to doing it multiple times.  This one would be a little difficult for children, oftentimes being more frustrating than fun, as fun as a puzzle could me.  But all in all it has a nice mix of difficulty with accessibility, and results in a gorgeous picture of Neuschwanstein Castle nestled away amongst trees.  A recommend.	1
My niece turned 4 and wasn't very good at puzzles, but loves Frozen.  So I ordered this. It arrived just in time for her birthday and she loves it.  So glad I could get it here because the stores are always sold out of Frozen merchandise.	1
I bought this set of 3 puzzles for my Frozen loving kids.  We are huge Ravensburger fans and these puzzles didn't disappoint.  Each puzzle is just under 8 1/2" X 8 1/2" square.  The colors are nice and vivid and the picture quality is excellent.  All pieces are mixed together in one bag.  The puzzles need to be separated after opening it (we put each one into a baggie back in the box when done).  One back is plain, the other is striped, and the other is dotted.  We also have the 100 piece Ravensburger Frozen puzzle as well and LOVE it.	1
Great jigsaw puzzle! Challenging in places, but not so difficult to be frustrating. Needs a large table as finished picture was 32.5" x 23.75". Usual Ravensburger quality - all the pieces fit together nicely and I didn't find any pieces that had not been cut properly. I would recommend this puzzle.	1
I loved the view, but still prefer 1000 to 1500, particularly when a lot of the pieces are similar in colour.  Quality of the jigsaw and the print was excellent, as always with Ravensburger.	1
Really enjoyed doing this puzzle. Nice picture.	1
Beautiful puzzle - I should stick to the 1000 piece puzzles though.  The 1500 piece puzzle is a bit of a challenge.	1
I am never disappointed in a Ravensburger jigsaw puzzle. Hours of fun!	1
Beautiful puzzle. Top right piece came all wrinkled and ruined and it's missing 1 piece. Great otherwise.	1
This was a beautiful puzzle and was mid-range as far as the challenge goes.  As is typical with Ravensburger puzzles, the quality of the pieces themselves is top-notch and makes doing the puzzle even more enjoyable.	1
I always enjoy Ravensburger puzzles, but this is one of my favorites! I was just so much fun to complete and lovely as a finished pieces. Superb quality as usual! I would rate this a MEDIUM difficulty. Thanks Ravensburger!	1
One piece missing.  Beautiful puzzle.  But the last three I have received have had pieces missing.  What gives?	1
a very nice puzzle with vibrant colors.  I will be purchasing more through Amazon instead of trying to shuffle through the brick and mortar store's limited selection.  all the pieces were there and I was very pleased.  thanks.	1
I just love Ravensburger puzzles.  The quality is outstanding.  They are challenging, but I find them so much fun to work on, I have to limit the time I spend on my puzzles. I find it so relaxing and puzzles are one of the things mentioned for seniors to keep your brain up to speed!	1
This puzzle has pieces that are not as thick as I would like.	1
I had a great time putting this one together here at home. Pieces fit together terrifically!	1
Fun to do	1
A difficult puzzle, of course. Ravensburger is the best.	1
The scenery in the picture is really nice with clear sharp colors.  After receiving the puzzle and seeing all the greens and blues, thought it was going to be a real hummer to put together but surprisingly it was not.  There was enough variation in those respective colors as to render it less difficult.  Pieces are sharply cut and stay put when correctly placed together.  Very small amount of cutting dust in bag.  All pieces were present.  High quality puzzle from Ravensburger.	1
Beautiful puzzle ! I have not started it yet but looking forward to putting it together!	1
Nice puzzle and pic.	1
This puzzle is a good challenge for its 1000 pieces. All the different versions of green/forest make you pay attention to shading and texture details. The water and sky parts are comparatively easy. All in all, lots of fun and just the right amount of difficult.	1
Great puzzle at a reduced prize. It was a heavy-duty puzzle that made a great present.	1
finishing now.. with my 95 year old Mom	1
I am going to sound like a puzzle snob, but there are only two puzzles I love to buy: Ravensburger and Buffalo. I actually prefer Ravensburger over Buffalo, because the cut is to perfection. But Buffalo isn't a distant second. I have put other puzzles together, just because they were gifts or because they had really, really pretty pictures. But I keep coming back to my two standbys. This Norwegian Fjord puzzle was purchased for my father, Mr Olson. You can probably figure out why. He loved it so much that he glued it together and framed it for his furnace room wall. You're probably wondering what kind of nut decorates his furnace room...but remember that Norwegian part? They dot every i and cross every t to the point that the furnace room is tiled, has a raised wooden ceiling, has custom cabinets for storage, and has louvered doors to tuck the appliances away neatly. It also has room for a bicycle and tread mill...hence the need for inspiring decor. This puzzle is large and has amazing depth in its colors. It's PERFECT!	1
Item was as described and very nice.	1
Beautiful photo and great ravens burger puzzle quality as usual	1
We enjoyed putting this puzzle together.	1
Absolutely loved this one...just the right level of challenge for a pleasurable experience...beautiful	1
We own lots of puzzles, and so far this one is the best! Took about a month to complete working on it evenings after work and a little bit on weekends. Picture is beautiful! Love Ravensburger puzzles!	1
enjoy a hard puzzle...challenges my brain...perfect	1
Perfect!	1
The wife and I are new to jigsaw puzzles, having decided it would be a fun and inexpensive way to spend some time together.  This was our first puzzle, as well as first Ravensburger puzzle.  I bought a few different ones, based on the perception that Ravensburger seems to be the major, quality brand when you look around at different puzzle makers.  That said, the puzzle is well constructed, and all of their images are beautiful and interesting, providing quite a bit of challenge.  In this case, however, we were somewhat disappointed to find that our puzzle was missing a piece.  I guess it happens from time to time, and we were just unlucky to have it happen on the very first puzzle we attempted.  Hoping that we have better luck on our next puzzle from Ravensburger.	1
High quality puzzles, great purchase if you are looking for puzzles!  Cut very well and sturdy!  You will have fun with this!	1
This is a perfect toy for the family. We all had a great time with it. I suggest a portable board to protect and keep the puzzle away from undesirable hands while you are not playing. I do not have enough space at home to reserve a table for it so, part of the fun was increased because we had this portable board where we kept the puzzle	1
The Revell kits have a lot of issues compared to the Tamiya but your paying about one fifth the price. Also this is a FU1. I like the kits and have built two. You need to choose though wheels up or wheels down the moving just doesnt work well and leaves huge gaps if you build it with the movable wheels.	1
My 10 year old son really enjoyed building and painting this model (with dad's help).	1
I built this model in 1/48th scale, but prefer the large scale myself.  I feel that scales 1/72, 1/76, 1/100th, and 1/144 are a waste of good plastic that can be used on making larger scale models.  At least ones that are visible to the naked eye.  This model is excellent and would go good in any diorama.  I usually build them with a mint paint job then whether them to look war torn, then add appropriate surroundings.  The surroundings for this one will be a challenge because of it's large scale.  If a Navy plane is what you want for your collection then I would recommend either the Corsair or the Hellcat.	1
I think this is one of Schleich's most realistic horses. The coloring is pratically like real Haflingers, and he is a very cute gelding. I like the other two Haflingers, but this one is the best of the three.	1
We bought this guitar for our smaller seven year old son. It was hard to choose a guitar, because there are so many out there...toy version and real...but which to choose?  This one is worth the pos. feedback I am giving it. It seemed so small and cute when I opened it, but it is perfect for little hands and bodies!  I found the price very reasonable since we aren't sure if he will "keep the interest",(some toy ones cost close to this) but yet I wanted him to feel like he was getting a REAL guitar, in hopes that he will keep learning.  I found that the guitar is very nice, not a toy at all, tunes well, looks very attractive and sounds nice too.  I was impressed that it came with a warranty.  I am happy that I didn't spend close to this for the toy versions...and I got the real deal instead.  Shipping was INCREDIBLY fast from this company.	1
my son loves it.. perfect for a 3 yr old crazy about fire engines.	1
Family hates the noise but grandson LOVES IT!!!!! It's perfect if you want a great toy fire truck!	1
Really great	1
Great fire truck for the value!  I did not want to spend double or triple for a toy truck and luckily found this one on Amazon!  I am pleased with the quality,  our son has been playing with it for a week straight and playing with the ladder non-stop.  I was afraid it would break off as he keeps pulling it up and down and turning it around and also holding on to the ladder only as he's dragging the truck around, but so far so good!  I would highly recommend this for anyone with a child that loves fire trucks and this one does make noise but not too bad as the noise isn't too loud or long.  It's a substantial size, at least 12-14"L so it's big and fairly durable truck.  I am not sure how long this will last but given it's a Tonka and the price was right, you can't go wrong with this buy!	1
Great size for my 2.5T son. He likes it. It makes 3 different siren sounds. You can pull up the ladder on top. The doors can also be opened. Sometimes my son puts his lego people inside. :) Great toy for the price of $15. The plastic is not as thick as the fisher price toys and the like. But, seems durable enough.	1
awesome fire truck!	1
Love this fire truck!! It is very sturdy..	1
Cheap plastic. Certainly not worth $40.	-1
I bought this for my nephew and one year later he still has this toy pegged as his favorite.  Tonka's high quality standards are evident in this truck.  It is sturdily constructed and can take some drops, hits, and dings.  The lights and siren feature are a huge hit, they are loud, but fortunately they are not obnoxiously loud.  This truck is very high on detail and fun!	1
Looked all over for what I wanted and fouind it at Amazon for a reasonable price. My daughter and Grandson love it.	1
My 3 yr old loves it, He plays with the fire truck all the time, the lights, the realistic sirens and looks just like a New York City fire truck. Love it. Thank You, 5 stars all the way.	1
My nephew loved the sounds and flashing lights and is really happy with this gift.  It is a great toy for a great price.	1
Going on 2 yrs of owning & still works great!!  Great for imaginations.  My 4 year old & 5 year old boys just love it.  & they got it from Santa.  Requires batteries also for the not too loud siren.	1
My three year old daughter was very picky about exactly what she wanted in her fire truck. She absolutely loves this. We have had no problems with durability and even have had our one year pull it around. We are thouroughly happy wih it and my doughter is now in love with it and every real fire truck she sees. As an added bonus it came with a DVD of real firemen. She loves this and has watched it several times. After watching she also now says "Don't play with fire." I could not be happier with our purchase.	1
Does NOT STAY TOGETHER, junk plastic meets metal threads and does NOT stay together. Couldn't even use it once.  "This product does not have a return policy."  What?????  Buyer beware, pay an extra $5 to get one that works.	-1
It sucks.	1
Simple and straight forward easy to use and handy tool to removing un needed solder in electronics projects and repairs.	1
I do very little soldering but when I do I make mistakes of globbing solder on the connection and have to redo the soldering.  This tool came in handy and sucks the solder right off the connection like it is suppose to.  Thanks.	1
Works as designed	1
Took me a while to get the hang of it, but it does seem to work pretty well.  I've used it to remove 30 to 40 components from a board and it hasn't shown any type of wear or tear.	1
Worked great for removing some old solider on my Triumph tooth brush circuit board.  Highly Recommend!	1
It didn't even come with the cap...I couldn't even use it out of the box. The tip was simply missing. I'm sure it would have been a great tool despite that.	-1
Unfortunately is sucks but not in the good way	-1
This pump worked great at first. But then the top half would eject itself with the mainspring after depressing the button. Graduated up to using desoldering braid and a few other tricks after this kept malfunctioning.	-1
Trash. Broke on opening up from cheap jute and plastic Chinese packaging. The spring hit me in the cheek and almost my eye.	-1
very affordable solder sucker. After few years of use it still in good shape.	1
Worked perfectly for when I made some mistakes while soldering. Had no issues with a melting tip.  **I was not paid or given a discount for my honest review**	1
if you solder you need one of these - this style works great if you are soldering circuits - works good for stained glass - IF you have a lot of solder to move can be time consuming - but isn't everything?  LOL	1
works great way cheaper the those thieves at Radio Shack charge and works better !!	1
works when solder braid is undesireable	1
Just what I wanted.	1
Broke on its very first project.  Waste of money.	-1
And not in a good way nobody took the time out to tell me not to get this. So I'm taking it into my own hands to tell you here  right now it sucks! I'm not professor of suction but I have played one on tv. So you can trust me on this one. Crapola. hey you're welcome	-1
good to have around	1
Works great and great price.	1
Thankfully I have this now!	1
Not much to say, it is what it is. works just fine.	1
It SUCKS! in the good way.	1
This product sucks.. and that's a good thing	1
Good	1
Horrible product!  Doesn't do what's it's meant to do.  Has become a toy for my toddler rather than desoldering	-1
Works really well.	1
Works very well. I wish I didn't need it.	1
Bought two of these, one for me - one for my dad.  Really like the weight of the pump, feels good and it's easy to control.	1
Works great and does its job	1
works really well	1
It sucks, but in the functional way.	1
does its job	1
It's a solder sucker. Not much else to say. It sucks solder like it's supposed to.	1
My husband said this works great!  Met his expectations 100%.	1
Used one time and it does do the tirick.  I do like the fact that the unit does come apart and can easily be maintained.	1
Works like a charm. I use this frequently to desolder through hole and surface mounted components.	1
I've used this only once salvaging some parts from a motherboard. On the 24-pin socket, I think a larger size might have worked better. For some smaller items that I removed, it worked quite well.	1
Worked perfectly; You need to be smarter than the device.	1
Just needed it for a quick job and it worked great and cleaned easy but all plastic but for the price it is hard to complain	1
bought this for a repair to instrument cluster on my truck. this thing sucks...really...it sucks...as in doesnt work worth a darn. i use solder suckers all the time at work so i know what to expect from one. this thing was useless. chinese crap.	-1
Received a unit with a plastic tip&tail. Not as pictured. Junk! Take heed from others here reporting they did not receive the Weller item either.	-1
a	1
Works as advertised!  I wouldn't recommend this for those times when you're working very fine detailed soldering, as the tip on this is rather large compared to areas most people would need to suck solder away from whatever they're working on.  But for larger areas, this item works great.	1
unopened box	1
Nice companion to your soldering iron/gun.	1
how did i ever do it without it... if your looking at it than you need it!!!!	1
Works as advertised, but the release switch is awkward to use when working.	1
First time using one of these... What a time saver! I've completely dismantled mine and it is totally worth the $7. The solid steel shaft runs from below the thumb loader to a self-cleaning tip the pushes the cooled solder from the nose when you reload the plunger. Occasionally it was stiff for a stroke or two, but once it clears the cooled solder, it back up to speed. If you do take yours apart, make sure to thread the piston and shaft from the tip end of the tube exterior.	1
Works great	1
Works good	1
They work.  Not sure what else to say...  I wish amazon allowed "stars" without comments.	1
Works great, handy tool	1
Somehow both our washing machine and dryer failed at the same time, and we began to do a fair amount of soldering. This then required a solder sucker to ensure we did it cleanly.  We weren't sure how well this would work, but we were quite pleasantly surprised. It did the job easily and smoothly.  Well recommended.	1
Very nice, useful and good quality item. Thank you.	1
It is basic solder sucker pump and works well.  I purchased this as part of my basic soldering kit and have been happy with.	1
For some reason, this showed under "Weller," a good brand known for quality, but the actual description says the brand name is Parts Express. I'm not sure what that's about but the actual pump doesn't have any Weller branding on it. At first, that was disappointing but the pump is a good weight and pretty sturdy so it appears, so far, to be of decent build quality.  It has a self-ejection function, which is a good plus. When you recharge it (by pressing the plunger), you just press it a little bit past the "click" and you'll see the metal tip come out of the end forcing out the solder.  The plastic tip seems pretty hearty too. I've touched it against the soldering iron a few times and other than discoloration, it hasn't been an issue. The cheap ones will often melt or deform simply by getting them too close to the iron. It's nice you can easily find and order a replacement tip for when it does eventually get damaged: just Google "standard replacement tip #370-031". It's $2.25 on the manufacturer's site.  It picks up solder okay. Really old electronics with corroded solder and/or higher lead content are a bit tougher but I don't have any other solder sucker to compare it to on that point. Given the good quality of the tip, you can (and have to) get really close to the soldering iron when you hit the button to release the plunger. A couple "plunges" on a joint take care of most of it. I still have to heat the contact a bit more to loosen the last bits of solder holding the component to the PCB but it's still much easier and cleaner than soldering braid.  It also helps if you apply a little new solder to the joint before desoldering. The new solder holds heat better and keeps the joint hotter for that extra split second when you pull the soldering iron away and hit the plunger button.	1
Great Product	1
fixing boards - this makes it easy	1
These work great!	1
standard item for any DIY'er's solder station!	1
Works really well, though the end was going to melt off but it doesn't, even with the iron at max.	1
never heard of a pump before...used to desoldering braids.  This product is amazing.  I was skeptical at first, but this is a great tool for when u need to desolder.  I used it in combination with the braids and was abel to replace a power jack on a laptop.	1
Great for circuit boards	1
I've used this countless times since purchasing it about 6 months ago. It has worked perfectly every time, and it's very easy to discharge after you've sucked up some unwanted solder. It works great for what it is, and I found the price to be very reasonable.	1
There's a few times it didn't suck solder, but I think I was also petting a kitty. The cat was fluffy, too.	1
After purchasing 3 different types of these pumps, finally found one that works as described and as reviewers said and gave a few tips on how to use this tool. The plunger spring is easy to pull back, trigger button is easy to push (unlike the other three I purchased). It feels well crafted in your hand, not just a light piece of plastic, most of all it will suck up ALL of the solder around a single pin (unlike the others I purchased). I had to cock the others several times to remove all the solder from a single pin and the tip placement was the same, right next to the pin with the iron on the opposite side. Some reviewers said it clogs up but I have used it at least 100 times and it has not clogged up on me. For the price and quality look no further... This Is The One!	1
Works better than desoldering braid. Just push the plunger down, heat up the joint, put the pump nozzle to it and push the button. I haven't used it that much so I'm not sure how durable it is.	1
I am pleased with the quality of the product. My only complaint is that the product has a plastic component threaded into a metal component. It has been my experience that this is never a good thing. Despite this, the product is of decent quality and functions as it should.	1
Having never used one of these before, my expectations on how it would work were a little high. Although it does work on larger solder spots, the smaller ones prove a bit difficult for this thing to suck up. I would assume a better or more precise tip would fix that though.	1
Does what it's suppose to thought would work much better, maybe after a lot of practice I will gain more experience with it.	-1
Haven't the chance to use it but my buddy has one and says it works great.  Came in good packaging and the quality seems pretty durable.	1
Easy to clean, works well at what it's supposed to do. I think this is a super nice upgrade over solder wicks. I will still probably end up using the wick every once in a while, but this is so much better. Sturdy build too, does not feel cheaply made at all. If you're looking for one, this is the one you should get.	1
Seems to work but i have only had a small sample to test against, looks easy enough to clean, it is much bigger than i thought	1
Pull the black knob out all the way, like cocking an automatic weapon. Touch the wet solder with the tip and press the release button on the side, and the solder is sucked right up. Easy to clean, and works perfectly. (Better than I expected it to.)	1
The product arrived in good shape.  It was immediately put to use and we are still using it.  Like it!	1
I bought this for my husband and he told me that he loves it. it works great. The price is just right.	1
It has a sturdy construction, the tip is better constructed than others that I have used. It has a nice color	1
this simple tool is really nice to have and this model allows it to be operated with one hand.  You cock the spring loaded suction end then hit a release button and it sucks the hot solder into the tube with vacuum force.  Be careful as the solder will empty back out the same hole in shards when reset.	1
cheaply made! really feels cheap, looks cheap, hardly works. I am not sure how long it will last. better off buying an expensive one	-1
I bought this for a repair job on a Samsung LCD TV. After seeing a similar product at Radio Shack for $15, I decided it was too much to pay. As far as materials go, this product is quite well constructed. The housing is made of solid aluminum, on part with flashlight tubing. As for the actual functionality of the product, it was unsatisfactory for my needs. Suction is very poor or non-existent. It does not create enough force to pull the melted solder into the tube. I had to repeatedly plunge and release to get any of the solder off the leads. It would've been the same as if I used a pencil and flicked away the solder. What I thought was going to be a 30 minute job ended up taking over an hour because I was slowed down by this sucker.  Another thing to be careful of is the sides of the plunger tube. It's just an aluminum cylinder cut in half, so the edges can potentially cut you if you run your thumb down it the wrong way. I was a sucker for buying this and threw it out after one use.	-1
I used this item during a recent repair of computer electronics wiring.  It worked as advertised, no complaints out of me!	1
Works very smooth, has a predictable trigger and creates a good suction. Made of metal with a heat resistant tip.	1
I've tried about 20 times and never had it suck any solder.  I'm not very good at this, so I asked my friend who is an electrical engineer and builds circuit boards all the time, to try it.  He tried several solder joints and never got it to suck anything.  He has a different "sucker" that he says does work, but he is more a fan of solder wicks.  I don't recommend this product.	-1
I bought this cause it was cheap and figured it did a better job than paper towels. After soldering a very tiny piece to a laptop, it didn't work at all. Maybe the place to suck the solder was too small for it. Maybe there wasn't enough solder for it to suck up. I don't know. All I do know is that to try and use it was a pain. You have to hold the soldering iron in one hand, the part in your other, and that leaves two fingers to use this product. Not to mention that when it "sucks" it's got some nasty kickback, like firing a gun. I would not purchase this unit. Spend the extra money and get one that works, isn't a trigger based unit, and can be held with something other than your hand. As I said, maybe the conditions were wrong or I don't know what I'm doing, but this caused more problems than it helped...It just didn't work.	-1
I never thought I'd have a reason to use a de-soldering pump, but recently I found myself disassembling the power supply of an LCD TV. The TV manufacturer had placed inferior capacitors on the circuit board of the power supply and after 2 years, the TV would not turn on. After much research, I found that I could swap out the bad capacitors myself and save a ton of money. So I purchased the desoldering pump to help remove the old solder from the circuit board by vacuuming up the hot solder so that the capacitor can be replaced. Though I had no experience with circuit boards, I was able to complete the task successfully, and the TV now works like new. The desoldering pump worked perfectly, and I can honestly say, "This product sucks!"	1
A bit small, but geez it was tough!  Upon arrival I was a little worried that it wouldn't hold up past the first few kids and that some of the party guests wouldn't have a chance to hit it. We had a hard time breaking it, even after getting the adults involved. Considering it was purchased just to be destroyed, it was very much worth the money.	1
(Written by the buyer's husband) After doing a LOT of research on high quality soldering irons, I was really going to buy a professional soldering station for more than twice the price. My wife surprised me with this as a gift before I could buy and I thought I would give it a try since I could not find ONE review on it! I can honestly say I am so very glad I gave it a chance! After heavily using this iron for the past couple months, it has continued to heat up quickly (within a minute) to the highest settings, it stays hot after continuous soldering ( I solder about 10-20 joints per minute), and I love the perks that come with this station: 1. I can plug any wall outlet iron into it no matter how professional or how cheap, and vary temp settings with this station. 2. The iron holder can be switched to the other side of the station for ease of lefty-righty handedness. 3. Never has there been any issues with warming up, such as smoking, or odd smells (which I have read many accounts of for other non-name-brand irons). 4. The cords are not overly stiff as I have seen in other soldering irons.  The only con for me is I personally love a digital temp readout... but if it is not professionally imperative to know the temperature, this is a fantastic value and best bang for the buck I have seen! PERFECT product for hobbyists and I would venture to say for professionals as well!  Don't let a lack of reviews deter your decision! Give Elenco's Station a chance!  *****  3 years after purchase... And another update nearly a year after the comment I left on this review: Both station and iron are still doing extremely well. I've never replaced the tip and it still works great. I've been doing a lot of SMD soldering with the original tip, however I am going to be getting a separate brass tip cleaner.  Still one of the best purchases that any hobbyist can make. The reviews that got irons that didn't heat up must have gotten the fluke one off bad ones - because this has been going strong for me for about 3 years now. No complaints! I would definitely buy this again.	1
This is a great iron.  I used to have a Radio Shack iron that was bulky and always got dirty.  Having this setup with the temperature control and built-in sponge will save you lots of hassle.  I've only had it for about 2 weeks, but I've used it for about 10 hours at least.  Get the extra tips and the desoldering wick if you are planning a serious project.  (I was changing out LEDs in 5 exit signs so I had to remove them and put new ones in.  The bigger tips work well for desoldering, the little tips work great for installing small items)  I see no need to get a more expensive model...  *****  UPDATE 8may2013 I've been using this for about 4 years now.  I'm not using it as much as when I first reviewed it, but thats just for lack of projects.  It still works great.  I probably use it several times a year.  Last year I used it quite a bit when I wired some LED undercabinet lights.  Anyway, just wanted to update my review to let you know that its still working great after 4 years of moderate home-owner use.  If it ever dies, I will buy another one... its a nice iron!	1
This is a great iron. Temperature control is very good and it heats up fast and holds the heat well	1
Works well, certainly better than my old Walmart issue. Temp regulation is nice too. A friend recommended it to me, and I am not disappointed.. The Soldering iron can also be plugged in straight into the wall, so it is not limited to work with this station only.	1
First time I've need a soldering station, it works as I expected.  SImple, but flexible enough to accomplish most of the tasks I have for my hobbies that require soldering.	1
Nice Elenco soldering station. It heats up in good time and the heat seems to keep steady the entire time I am using it. The power switch is handy so as to let you keep the temperature set right where it works best for you.	1
I brought this station because it was used in an article showing how to solder a surface mount part.  It is working fine.	1
I purchased this for my daughter at Christmas.  She LOVES it. It is one of the 3 (out of about 15)toys that she plays with constantly.  I don't understand some of the moms complaints about it coming apart.  Yes the bench slides off (its supposed to). The sign comes off constantly...it's supposed to! Yes, they can rip off the slide...it's a TOY.  The great thing is that all of these things go right back into place because...they're supposed to!  Forgive my sarcasm, but this is a toy and it's made for babies to play with andd pull apart.  Even the doors come apart.  My daughter loves the music and she beats on it and sits on it and it still works beautifully.  Fun toy...for Mommy too!!	1
I have two sons (16 mos & 3 years) and they both REALLY enjoy this weeble toy.  This is one of the rare toys that I do not have to hide in the closet for a few weeks in an attempt to regain their attention.  Both children have never lost their interest in playing with "Weebelville".  Maybe it's the spinning circles that move the weebles along (and sometimes throw them around as well) or maybe it's the music, or the pad you push to make everything spin, or the pads that make the weebles dance.  It could be a variety of things as this toy is fully packed with two levels that contains all kinds of slides, windows, doors and other openings that make them fascinated with the workings of weebleville.  I don't really care what it is as long as it continues to keep them busy for more than a minute at a time.  Purchase this toy -  which is reasonably priced - and sit back and relax as they keep themselves amused.	1
Could Weebles be more fun?  I played with my sister's weebles as a child, just the name & the slogan bring back memories!  I bought two this year for Christmas.  One for my son, age 2 and one for my niece (my sister's daughter, of course).  My son pressed one button while it was still in the box and was dancing all over the living room on Christmas morning.  He has played and played with it since.  I definately do not regret the purchase.  My sister said that my niece, who is almost 1, dances also and quickly figured out how to acitvate the toy, causing the music to play and the weebles to go round and round.  The toy is sturdy, requires minimal (very simple) asssembly.  The colors are bright and fun.  Fabulous toy, lots of fun so far!  I do recommend this toy for the young children as the weebles are very chunky and easy to pick up, and the toy is so simple to operate.  Great toy, lots of fun!	1
very nice barbie for the princess's  hair is weird but legs bend nice. He has been kissing alot of princess's lately	1
I also agree.  I don't know what they were thinking when they made one doll for 2 characters with different colored hair.  We ended up opening the box, taking out the "extra" outfit, and buying a regular Ken doll to put it on.  The crown that was supposed to be the gift for the princess ended up being Julian's crown.  We needed all four characters to go with a carriage set marketed to hold all four characters.	-1
Challenge but fun.	1
Great puzzle!  Very difficult but not totally impossible except for the bowl. It is also very pretty once it is finished!	1
Ok ++	1
So do-able and beautiful.  Such a pleasure to assemble.  I will be doing this puzzle over again many future times.  It's gorgeous and fun to work with, as the pieces are good quality and varied.  Highly recommended!	1
This is a beauty! We framed this one!	1
I really enjoyed this puzzle. My only criticism was that the pieces don't have much of a texture which creates a strong glare, however, the pieces were very thick and of good quality. And best of all, no missing pieces! The masterpiece painting was fun to put together and absolutely beautiful when finished. It would be good for those who likes to frame the finished piece.	1
Beautiful and pretty advanced.  It was well cut and nicely fit together.  I do a lot of puzzles with my elderly mother.  One after another really.  This one was one of the more challenging and beautiful ones.	1
Chrismas present for husband. He loves challenging puzzles, so I am very excited to see him open this! Came in great condition! Box is in pristine shape!	1
I got these for a project.  They worked pretty good, for the price.  The screws don't tighten down really tight so if you push real hard it might move... but just don't push that hard...  The only time I was tempted to push this hard was when I was desoldering.  One concern I had was that the metal teeth could hurt the circuit board, so I put some shrink-tube over the tips of the teeth and heated it up (hold the clips open during this) and now they are rubber-coated!  The other issue I had is that the helping hands would slide around (the base would move).  So I drilled two holes in the base and screwed it down to the workbench.  Now it doesn't slide or fall over... a much safer setup!  So, if you buy this (you should) just add some rubber grippers and screw down the base.	1
This is a good little product and the price is right.  The clips hold pretty well and are easy enough to adjust.  The base could be a little larger to stabilize the unit but you can just as easily attach it to a board or something.	1
Beautiful.	1
Very cheaply made item.  Tension adjuster wingnuts bent when adjusted.  Base is unstable and apparatus topples easily. Beware if purchased.	-1
I bought this to help me solder PCB boards for pedal building (BYOC delays, flangers, etc).  It works ok, but it is REALLY small, so don't expect a large piece of equipment.  I think you would have an easier time if you mounted this helping hands to a board so it doesn't move.  The magnifying glass is handy as well as the clips.  If it wouldn't move around as easily I would give it 5 stars.  Mount it and you can't live without it.  Well made though.	1
Overall for the price of this unit there is not much to complain about. The major grip i have is the wing nuts to tighten or loosen the gator clips and glass could use improving. The base is heavy but i wouldn't mind if it was heavier. I took off one star b/c of the locking system used, it is a little cumbersome but overall it is a good product and im not sure why so many people bashed it. It is good for light work and for the price you can't expect much more. Mine was 100% assembled when i pulled it out the box so overall im happy with it.	1
Fun kit to teach my son how to solder. I grew up making Heahtkits but son has never used a soldering iron. Nice kit. Recommended.	1
After 4 tries I finally got the siren and flashing lights to work !! Each time I purchased another package wanting to start off from scratch... The 3rd package came with a broken board which I tried to fix with foil-repair tape, but that did not help. I could only get the siren to sound, with no flashing LED lights.  On my first 2 tries I had the Resistors misplaced, so only the non-flashing LED lights came on but with no siren. On the fourth try I tried to follow the well written instructions to the 'T". This time I got the LED's to light and the siren to sound, but they were not intermittent ? The instructions said to check the C1, C2 capacitors which I did and noticed a weak connection. After I fixed the connection, the siren and flashing lights worked as they should.   SUCCESS ! Being a beginner this was not an easy project. It seemed simple at first, but plenty of mistakes were made. The good thing is that I got a lot of practice soldering, something which I tried to avoid. Now that I'm feeling a little bit more confident, I'm ready to move on to other DYI more complicated projects.	1
Great way to improve my soldering skills, with clear instructions, and some exercises before soldering the components on. My skills have increased considerably with this, and I now have a small noisemaker that my wife can't stand.	1
Simply great if it is used as intended.	1
My friend is older with shaky hands, wanted to learn to solder, but she had trouble with the practice pads LIFTING on her. I gave her a proto-perfbord to start before trying to complete this one. It looks like fun though.	1
My title says it all.  Great little learning kit that I wish my Father would have showed my @ my age,  but no Amazon back then.  :)	1
thanks . this came on time.. It was a gift and they loved it.	1
Must have been my crappy soldering skills because I could never get it to work.	-1
Everything was in good condition	1
Great teaching tool.	1
As described. Good price. Quality components.	1
Absolutely helped me learn about soldering. Easy construction, easy instruction, helpful to learn.	1
Fast shipping.  SHould be a great project for my boys.	1
My 9 year old loves this. After some hand-on adult instruction she has become fully proficient.	1
My kid loved building this kit.  It was a lot of fun and got him passionate about building/engineering.	1
Looks like fun	1
great product	1
nice kit, think of it as a model, once its done you won't mess with it again. the papers included have useful electronic info	1
My 12 year old son absolutely loved this!  It has taught him valuable information about electronics and soldering.  Highly recommend.	1
The kit an accompanying instruction booklet proved to be a meaningful lesson.  I went through mine carefully in two evenings.  The project itself can be completed much more quickly, but it's purpose is best served by taking time to become familiar with the resistor color codes, try out the solder mask, practice solder wicking, and develop good technique.  A very similar kit is available that includes the soldering iron.  Although I suspect that version of the kit is a great value for many students, I bought a much more expensive soldering station for myself and so I appreciate that I could buy the kit without the iron.  The kit includes a variety of component types that will introduce a student to the things they will find on other kits and products they will want to build.  Specifically it includes resistors, electrolytic capacitors, ceramic capacitors, diodes, transistors, an integrated circuit device, and a potentiometer as well as wire for jumpers, repairs, and leads for the speaker and battery.  The low-quality potentiometer quickly failed due to moderately rough handling by my kids.  The turning knob has to be torqued to get it to contact internally.  I don't fault the kit for that.  Providing a more rugged potentiometer or panel-mount at higher cost wouldn't add anything to the purpose of the kit.  I would buy more of these for anyone I cared for that wanted to learn to solder electronics.  Beyond this, I would consider a kit that teaches SMD techniques.  Personally I have no interest in soldering SMD by hand, but it's an important skill for the goals that some people have.  My own interests are more toward Manhattan-style construction.  Each person has their own reason for wanting to learn to solder electronics, but this kit is a good start for any of them.	1
Since engineering didn't include soldering at my university, I got a few different soldering project kits.  This one is a great intro, with good instructions and info on the circuit you are building.  Get this if you want an easy start into soldering or have an older kid who would enjoy it!	1
Nice little kit. Everything there, nothing missing. Clear instructions! Elenco never lets me down! I would recommend to a friend!	1

This kit is a practical way to learn how to solder electronic components on a circuit board. I have been teaching my son electronics for a few months now and it was time to move from theory to practice.  The kit includes detail instructions, circuit board, and all of the required components. I am usually leary of all-in-one kit projects since the quality is not always up to what you can get assembling it yourself, but decided to take a chance since we already have a fairly well stocked hobbyist electronics bench, but it turns out that the included items were mostly "keepers".  The siren project was fun to build with my son and it actually taught him good soldering techniques.  Highly Recommended!  CFH	1
I'm nearly 31 and used to solder all the time, got my HAM license when I was 15 and did a lot of my own radio repairs, however I hadn't soldered anything in 8 years or so and really hadn't touch resistors or any of these components in a long time. I saw this kit and thought it would be fun to get back into electronics and figured this was the perfect entrance back into that world. The kit has nearly everything you need. I found I needed a pair of needle nose pliers which the kit didn't include and a 9-volt battery to power the gizmo but the kit has everything else you need. soldering iron, solder, wire snips, Resistors, led's, etc. It took me around 30 minutes to put it all together. What I liked was this kit actually has a practice zone on the PC board so you can hone your solder skills on an actual board without fear of messing up. They have you make some brief solders, do a "repair" with a piece of wire, make a bridge and then clear the bridge. The kit really is very well done and the directions are clear, plus the board clearly lays out what goes where.  When I thought I was done I connected a 9 volt battery and was expecting it all to work, the lights flashed but I couldn't get any sound out of it. After checking each solder connection I realized I left off a tiny little piece, once i soldered that last piece on and put the battery back on it worked perfectly.... and then I read where you had to de-solder and re-solder a different resister to "fix it" which is all part of the directions.  The kit is excellent, I enjoyed it and will be picking up more of the Elenco project kits for soldering. It reminded me how much fun this stuff can be, and when you are done you have something to show for it. True the end gadget you make isn't that useful, but it's fun none the less, educational and worth the money.	1
The kids had a blast with these in the pool. Only vacation/occasional toys, so I can't speak to their longevity.	1
This is a very nice under the water toy collection it's really worth the money that you spend on it because you can get cheaper than the other places because I've checked but this gives a nice variety and the kids seem to enjoy it it's a really good buy	1
Lovethe variety of this set	1
Fun toys for the kids! Have held up all summer!	1
Kids love the sea horses the best.	1
These are great for fun in the pool. Better price than any store and it's a plus that it was a variety pack. We didn't have to buy a bunch of different toys. This pack brang a little of everything. Very durable toys and exactly what we were looking for!	1
The kids have been playing with these at the resort and love them	1
Kids love it	1
Who doesn't love diving for things like this	1
Great quality for the price. The little turtles inside the eggs are annoying and they get lost, but still happy with the purchase.	1
package is MUCH bigger than it appears here. Everything's a good size. It's a gift, so it hasn't been played with yet, but quality appears to be very good from the looks of it. Excellent value for price.	1
Great set. This has kept my daughter entertained for days on end! The colors are nice and bright. It has 4 rings, eggs and 4 discs. The eggs have cute little turtles inside. The only downside: they're already all scratched up from the pool surface, but my daughter doesn't seem to mind.	1
Fun for the kids to play with in the pool. Good price	1
Great!	1
the kids like to play with these	1
good quality, we are having fun with them	1
This product was purchased as a Christmas gift.  The receipent of the product liked it.  I was happy with my purchase.	1
works great perfect service , fast shipping , and just the way a was describe highly recommended , works super ,	1
But some of the colors were hard to see in a pool with a patterned bottom. If you have the classic white-bottomed pool, it'll be a breeze. Other than that, it's a great deal!	1
Even really bright kids sometimes need a little help learning their math facts... and the FlashMaster is the perfect toy/tool for the job.  My little one spent hours with it when she was first learning her facts.  She liked that she could pick an easy table, and get a perfect score; I liked that I could pick a table she was struggling with, and she could practice, and I could see how she scored.  We had a deal: she picked one table, I picked the next.  There are lots of options - select the operation (+.-.* or /) pick the table or let it select facts randomly, and decide if you want timed or untimed problems.  And parents or teachers can always go back and see how the child has scored.  It's been years since then, and every few months, she pulls out the FlashMaster.  It was handy for speed reviews when they introduced long division in 4th grade, and least common denominators in 5th.  In this era of calculator-based math classes, the FlashMaster helped her learn the facts she needs to be successful in all sorts of math in the future.  Thanks, FlashMaster!

We love this resource! It's a daily tool in our homeschool for multiple age ranges! No more flash cards!!!!!! Worth the money (and I'm a tightwad, lol)!!	1
I bought this for my daughter who needed a little extra help in math but kept breaking my laptop and messing up my iPad. She was on a plan of improvement, because she was struggling to learn her basic addition and subtraction facts in second grade. After using this twenty minutes each day, her plan of improvement was eliminated and she was back on track after only six weeks. She is now in third grade, using this to help her memorize her multiplication and division facts, and she is currently testing above grade level! The repetitive nature of the FlashMaster and its electronic-style flash cards has made an outstanding difference in our household! I would HIGHLY recommend it!	1
Fantastic learning device;  helps my 7 year old become proficient with his multiplication/division tables	1
Kids using in school recommended by teachers. Pretty pricey but compared to a DS or an xbox game probably not.	1
Great product	1
. Second grade teacher introduced this to me. This will grow with my kids. Like the special problems feature to review missed problems.	1
Wish they can add addition and subtraction in double digits as well.	1
Excellent product! Cheers to our hometown state!! Your friends in Saddlestring, WY!!	1
I bought this for my 8 year-old after seeing him use it with his math tutor.  It's an excellent tool for helping learn math facts relatively quickly.  It has addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, and you can adjust the level of difficulty and time of each quiz.	1
This is a very useful computer for kids that are learning their multiplication tables. They can practice at their own speed and learn it faster. I had bought this for my grandson and he loved it....  Very handy to have for your kids. I would recommend it to anybody to have.  Teaches your kids better at home...	1
this is a great tool for my 9 year old in continuing her math foundation, she does enjoy it in her spare time when she has nothing else to do, not just when i tell her to practice her math facts.	1
I purchased this product because my daughter was getting bored with the traditional flashcards. The Flashmaster has helped increase her speed and accuracy.  Her teacher has also noticed how much she has improved...I have her practice daily on the Flashmaster after she finishes homework.	1
My 7th and 8th graders used the FlashMaster heavily in kindergarten and 1st grade.  I purchased it because my 1st grader's teacher would have addition/subtraction speed tables.  My son was consistently last.  We used this for 15-30 minutes a night several nights a week and within a couple of months he was always finishing 1st or second. We continued using them through first grade and they mastered the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division tables with speed.  Both of my boys are now in accelerated math programs.  My 7th grader will have completed Alg I and Alg II honors at the end of this year, will start pre-Calc trig next year and hopes to take Calc BC AP in 9th grade.  My 7th grader took his SAT at 12 years of age and scored a 570 on the math section of the SAT which may not be perfect but it would not have been as high without the FlashMaster. My 8th grader has completed Alg I and Alg II and will be starting pre-calc trig in the 9th grade.  I truly believe the head start they were given by using the FlashMaster significantly improved their mathematically ability.  We still break them out once a year and review all their tables.  This and Bob's Books have been the best material investments I have every made in my children's lives.	1
My six year old loves using this thing for her math lessons. My wife and I were surprised at how fast she picked up on using it, not to mention how quickly she was learning basic math! She is already doing multiplication. Funny though. She always wants to get 100% so if she misses one, she always wants to start over from the beginning. But, this thing makes it easy to do so. Had a problem with the first one we ordered. Froze up after a few months, but after one phone call to FlashMaster customer service, we had a brand new replacement within a few days, no charge! Exceptional customer service. The lady my wife spoke with was great and eager to resolve the problem.	1
*****11/14/13***** I decided to try my own troubleshooting techniques on the broken Flashmaster last night and lo and behold, I got it to work! So if anyone is experiencing issues with theirs, try this. Press and hold the ON/OFF button and then (while still holding the ON/OFF button) press the RESET button, release both. It worked for mine and I hope it will do the same for yours :o)  *****11/11/13***** I contacted the company and the woman I spoke with was very kind and helpful. We went through some steps to see if we could get it to work. We couldn't. As with any product, there are some that come out defective. I have no doubt in my mind that this was a fluke and not a common occurrence with the product. I was thrilled to hear that they would be sending me a new one within a week and I am sure my daughter will be even more excited to have her game back. This company gave 100% customer service and for that I am grateful. Thanks Flashmaster!  *****Original Review*****11/09/13 Didn't last but a few hours. I have changed the batteries from the ones it came with, to brand new (out of the package) batteries, to two different kinds of rechargeables that I know are charged fully. It refuses to turn on.  For the few hours of use that my daughter was able to get out of it, it was loads of fun for her. She loved to "play" on it.	1
Brilliant little gadget.  Well worth the money - forget the flash and noisy bouncy toys for math.  This one is intuitive - just follow the red buttons - make your choices and goes.  Best feature is that it has a "special" button that remember the last 15 facts you messed up and will quiz you on those. You can shut the sound all the way off.  You can adjust the seconds to the next problem.  All this has already been said.  The batteries last forever - we've had ours for over 5 years.	1
Kicks flashcards to the trash.  This little gem is a no-nonsense practice your math facts machine!  NO distractions, either.  NO internet option looming on the screen.  NO video game icons calling your names.  Nope.  Just the facts, mam.  Math facts.  It's durable and kid tested tough, too.  We've dropped this little dude over and over again on the tile (maybe on purpose?) and 4 kids later, it is still delivering what it promises:  practice makes perfect.	1
Sometimes I think that playing math games or practicing on my phone or Kindle is distrating for my son-he sees all the games he COULD be playing. FlashMaster is great because it's old school. Recommended to me by another parent, I felt silly paying $60 (with shipping) for something so low-tech but it's been GREAT. Flashmaster offers several option (+,-,x, and division) and several levels. There are timed tests, flash cards, practice, and it remembers the problems that were incorrect. The best thing is that it's all there-just a screen and numbers, nothing else to distract my son. It gives a happy noise when you complete things and they're right, an a beep when they're not. It reminded me of the Little Professor calculator I had when I was young (yes, being poor at math runs in the family).It's totally portable and He can take it in the car, to the pool, whereever we have to wait and do 10 minutes a day without any fuss. It's made a big difference. Sometimes low-tech is best!	1
My son is in second grade and does well in math. Sometimes he reverses his numbers and letters, but not a lot. Even when he wrote his number backwards you could still tell his answer was 5. That is why it was heartbreaking to see a child confident in math suddenly calling himself stupid because he wasn't progressing using FlashMaster. Unfortunately, it took a month of odd failures and tears before my son's teacher realized he couldn't use the Flashmaster because the digital display uses all straight lines. My son couldn't consistently tell the difference between the 2 and 5!  You can't tell by looking at my post because of the numbers are made of curved and straight lines. However, if you look at the picture amazon shows of the FlashMaster the 6 x 7 = ?  everything is boxy and made of straight lines (unlike the numberline at the bottom used for answering questions.) My son has never had a problem using computer programs and nothing had held him back until now. It was the first time he told me he thought he was "stupid" and cried. It was the first time he had to deal with his classmates looking at him like there is something wrong with him.  It was the first time he was unable to participate in a class activity.  If my son wasn't good at math the teacher might not have realized why he was failing half his FlashMaster challenges. If the teacher hadn't taken the time to sit with my son and watch him work he probably never would have realized my son thought 2 + 2 = 10 because he thought it said 5 + 5.  It took about a month of frustration before anyone realized why my son was doing so poorly.  He didn't consistently mix up the 2 & 5. So if he hadn't done so well before FlashMaster was introduced everyone would have thought he just didn't understand math instead of not being able to read the display.  If anyone at FlashMaster reads this I hope you consider upgrading your display. It's not nearly as expensive as it used to be and it matters.  Some people may think it doesn't matter, but it does.	-1
My seven year old son figured this out very quickly! Definitely read the manual to understand all of the options for the FlashMaster - great for homeschooling! Fast shipping and customer service! Thank you!	1
Bought this for my 9 year old son-he is in the 3rd grade. I was a bit nervous because I didn't know if he would like it or not. He does like it and uses it a lot. He likes to challenge himself and check his scores. The added benefit of this "toy" is that it resembles a hand-held video game, so he doesn't feel that it is too babyish or to "educational."	1
My 23 month old daughter loves this.  It has chunky pegs, and is realistic for a 2 year old to be able to insert.  Excellent storage case and very well built product.  You can NOT go wrong with; one of the better toys we have...and its quiet! I expect this to last well into her 3rd year.	1
I got this board for my daughter for Christmas. At that time she was not even two and played with it for a good period of time. Very educational and fun activity that will keep your toddlers occupied for a good period of time.	1
Purchased for our 2 year old for Christmas.  Great design...it's a board and case all in one.  All pieces fit inside.  Bright colors and fun shapes.  You can also make your own designs.  Easy for child to get in and out by themselves.  Would recommend.	1
Love the colors.	1
So much fun with this toy! My niece just love it!	1
I can't say enough about this product.  Both my three year old and my two year old will ask for this several times a week.  They never get bored with it.  I like that it is completely contained and portable.  Great  for home or away.	1
I received this toy as a gift when my second daughter was born. I am pleasantly surprised at how much my daughters enjoy it! My 1.5 year old enjoys placing colors pieces onto the board at random. That's what toddlers do best- put things on and take thing off. Put things in and take them out. My 4 year old daughter enjoyed this toy too when she was younger, but it seems that she has now outgrown it.  This toy has many nice qualities. Firstly, all parts of the toy are made with good quality materials. Secondly, the toys comes with built in storage. This is a great feature. It ensures that the pieces are held together and don't get lost. Also, the patterns shown on the play cards are inviting and age appropriate.  I gave this toy a 4 star rating since there are some improvements that can be made. The pattern cards are printed on stiff paper. They should have been laminated since this toy is meant for the younger set. Also, the pattern cards are supposed to slide onto the back of the board. I always have trouble getting the cards into place. It is hard to maneuver the pattern cards into place.  All in all, this is a nice toy which keeps kids busy, and improves their fine motor skills.	1
This did not keep my two year old's attention and was only played with a few times in two years. Not a horrible toy, but definitely not worth the high price tag I paid!	-1
Bigger than I thought it was going to be, but definitely amusing to my little munchkin . I love how it has its own case.	1
Great toy for my 2.5yo.  Although it appears overly simple and boring to me, the size and skill level is just right for her.  She can manipulate the pegs easily and finish a picture in one sitting (with some parental encouragement).  She still needs me to change the design.  Some designs use up all pegs of one color, which means if you ever lose one, you'll be in trouble!  My daughter wanted white pegs, as well.  High quality.  I like the integrated easel and how it transforms into a slim storage case with handle.	1
Educational and can hold my 2.5 year old's attention for 20 minutes!  He likes the patterns and chooses a different one to do each time.	1
This is a great toy with lots of options.  The colors are bright and cheerful and the designs are adorable.  I love the way the game is held in it's own box to keep all the pieces in so they won't get lost.	1
Best toy my 3 year old got!  He really liked it.  He is not yet able to use the cards but really likes putting the pegs in and out!	1
Buying a toy for a 2 year old is hard.  The choices out there are limited because their skill set is just not quite where it needs to be to enjoy a lot of great toys.  This pegboard seems to hit the mark.  The pegs are well constructed, bright colors, and easy to snap in the holes.  My son LOVES it.  Drawbacks, he can't set up the peg board himself, and he can't put the design sheets in the slot himself either (so everytime he finishes a picture, he needs help, which is really Ok but just an FYI).  It also stores nicely.  The peg board snaps on top of the case holding all the pegs securely inside and there is a nice carrying handle on the side.  It sort of reminds me of the old lightbrights I grew up with, minus the light up feature.  Ovearall a very cute and reasonably priced toy!	1
My 2 year old loves this toy, he loves pegs, puzzles, etc. However he still puts toys in his mouth and he could easily swallow a peg. They're not that big, or chunky, as the description says. I will save this toy for later. Otherwise it would deserve 5 stars	1
Absolutely love it! Even my 15 yr old brother plays it! Im sure my toddler will love it too. I like that its very colorful and bright and a starting point to learn the colors. Plus it has a carry bag, which makes it convinient for traveling.	1
I got this because it was recommended on another website and didn't really have high hopes for it - didn't really think my 2 year old would be that amused by it.  She love it though!  It is definitely one of her favorite toys right away.  She fills in the picture colors, but then likes to use the rest of the pegs to fill in the rest of the board in whatever pattern she sees fit.  So she may not get the "point" but it keeps her entertained and I think it's good for her coordination.  She does not like to keep it in the easel and I wish the board had a backing to keep all the pictures in, but overall, I think it's a great toy and plan to purchase it for her friends' birthdays in the future.	1
My nephew loved it, and my sister too. It has 4 colors and large pegs for little hands. It comes with pictures in color and no color so little minds have a good creative thinking. I'm happy with the product. One thing though. It may look like a traveling toy, it is not. The plastic lock that came with it seems only be used to keep the pegs and pictures inside storage space. If your 2 year old happens to lift it up and take it along, you'll have a spill. It happened.	1
First of all, I want to clear up a flaw in the description of this toy on Amazon.  You don't get 16 different picture cards.  What you get is 8 that are double sided.  One side shows the picture with color for matching, and the other shows the same picture blank so kids can make it however they want.  I'm fine with this, but I did think it was a little misleading.  The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the pictures aren't laminated or anything.  They are just card stock, and they can get ripped while kids are putting them in the back of the board.  My 4-year-old already ruined one of ours, and you can't buy replacements.  Putting them in is sort of tricky, so I do it for my kids now so no more get ruined.  I still think this is a wonderful toy though because it teaches color matching.  It also gives kids a chance to use their imaginations and be creative, so it's a toy I would recommend.	1
This is a great toy for 2+. My daughter has no problem manipulating the pegs on her own, putting them away, sorting them, or using it as a travel case/toy. Also she spends a lot of time playing with this toy and can use it on her own. We have had no problems with the construction or quality of this toy. I would recommend it.	1
This ball comes apart and is very easy to put together.  It's only two pieces with a cilindrical rattle that goes in the middle.  The clickers and squeakers get ignored, but my daughter loves rolling the ball and taking it apart to rebuild it.	1
My son only likes the middle part of the ball.	-1
We bought this toy for our almost one year old & I believe he is the perfect age bracket for this toy. Its a solid toy, very well constructed & performs exactly as described. A good buy.	1
My daughter is only 9.5 months and she loves this.  She can put the ball in the top (not everytime, but maybe 30% of the time and getting better) and hits it a few times to drop it down to the track.  She loves the clacking noise it makes (warning to parents - it is NOT a quiet toy).  I showed her how one day. The next day she put the balls up herself and the day after hit them through.  She hasn't yet figured out the knob/switch on the side or what to do if there's another ball in the top preventing the balls from rolling down, so it will force some good problem solving skills.  I really like that it's fun (visually and auditorily), helps with motor development and hand-eye-coordination, as well as problem solving skills.  And she likes it because it is fun!  Edit: My daughter is now 16 months old and still likes this toy.  She doesn't play with it as much, as she's had it a while, and has sort of figured out the knob on the side.  When other kids come over (the oldest we've had is about 2 years), they've all had lots of fun with it and played for quite a while.	1
I wanted to like this ball run - compact, Tolo and therefore sturdy.... 1. The balls ARE heavy. Unfortunately, our toddler throws things for fun and anger. We'd be looking at broken furniture in no time. 2. The balls we got came without the cool black and white patterns. Just plain half-color, half-white. 3. The main ball run kept sticking - about 20% of the time. 4. The back run couldn't keep the balls on track; the balls would go careening off about 30% of the time. 5. The turning mechanism IS confusing, plus balls on top can block other balls, and... let's just say it annoyed the adult. If this were the only issue, fine. But the other issues added up to a fail for us.	-1
I bought this for my son who loves music. We had it for about 2 weeks before it started to malfunction. I didn't keep the receipt since I paid less than 20 bucks for this. He enjoyed it when it worked. Then it started to act funny. It would do what it was supposed to but an elephant noise would follow every thing he did (whether he played a song or hit letter A). OK... so we deal. Then it started to make click noises. Then the music set to knob #1 wouldn't work, just click-click-click. OK, so I figure maybe it needs batteries. That didn't help. Then, I figure the toy was a bust so I might as well take it apart and try to fix it. I messed around and got it working. It still make elephant noise but all 4 areas worked.... For about 2 days! Then it was messed up again and worse than before. Now all 4 knobs just click! The kid had it for less than a month and its fully dysfunctional!  OK, that being said, the music was nice. It was cute and The lights worked well. Taught numbers and letters and colors and animals and sounds. I did not like that if it got all messed up dirty-wise, you could take off the cover but you couldn't wash the cover because it had plastic all over it (just not mechanical plastic) and you can't put it in the washer. So that kind of stunk but oh well... It just was WAY beyond disappointment for me.  I hope this helps... it was fun but not durable in the least. Just a small warning from  my experience.	-1
This is not a fun toy for my 1 yr old grandson who is just getting into shapes has not played with this since the first day. He has other shape sorters that he does play with. I think if the shapes launcher worked, he might like it better.	-1
This sorter has shapes that are a precise fit making it more difficult to line up with their respective holes. The shapes have to be put in from the top of the drum because the internal parts are in the way when you try to put shapes through holes at the sides. When you push down on the trunk the shapes are supposed to empty out but they sometimes get stuck. A fun concept but frustrating for my 11 month old.	-1
Didn't work upon opening the box for my nephews Christmas present! Even changed the batteries 2 times to see if we were doing it wrong.	-1
I ordered the toy that was $24.95,and was charged that amount. I received the triangle that is similar but is $15.11, it does not have the mirror but it was packaged in the box that the $24.95 one comes in. I was then told they did not have the $24.95 in stock so they would have to send a return label, which they did, and refund me, which they better. I read another review on here where they received the cheaper version but I do not think they realized they ordered the expensive one and received the cheaper one. So check your package contents and be sure you received what you paid for. I felt like it was bait and switch.	-1
My daughter is 6 1/2 months old and pretty easily entertained. I read all the glowing reviews, and thought this would be a hit. So far, this hasn't been the case. The toy itself is bright, cheerful, and very very durable. I also like the fact that it doesn't need batteries. However, apart from a few things to spin, and a few shapes to fiddle with, there really isn't anything to sustain her interest. At first I was pleased to find a toy that wasn't at all noisy, but, given the lack of visual stimulation, I don't even think that that's a bonus. Also, the picture on Amazon of the toy shows a mirror at one end - the one I received had a boring spinner with a dog and a bone on one side, and a kind of "cage" design on the other. I think it's supposed to be an optical illusion when it's spun, but it doesn't work at all. Hopefully she'll find it more interesting as she gets older.	-1
This is supposed to be an "activity" triangle, but it really only has one activity on it.  That is spinning.  You spin the mirror and some shapes.  The only other thing you can do is rattle it, but it is too cumbersome for a baby to pick it up for that.  I didn't like this toy at all and my child thought it was boring as well.	-1
I don't know where they get "mini" fromt.  I thought 'mini' would mean my < 6mo could hold them.  They were big and bulky, even for my 2yo.  And cheap looking.  Went straight to donation.	-1
No.  The raised relief gets stusk as the globe rotates.  The cheap plastic stand lets the globe slip out frequently.  Pass on this globe.  Very cheap and flimsy.	-1
A natural map, meaning bumps for mountains, etc. just don't know why globes are so expensive. This one doesn't do anything. Rather pay more and get an electronic one	-1
Arrived damaged because the globe is made of cardboard. Also, the writing is tiny! Though the price is lower than most globes, in this case, you get what you pay for.	-1
Got this because of the good reviews and cheap price. It's a great globe, but the stand is extremely flimsy. You can't pick it up without it feeling like it is going to fall apart. In fact, simply by bending the holder a little bit the globe will come right out of it. I guess I'm just used to the globes we had growing up that had metal stands. This one has a plastic one that I'm not impressed with.	-1
There are three modes. My son's favorite is word hunt, where it asks him to find the letters to spell a word. He is three years old and does not know how to spell yet, but can usually find the letters it asks for to spell the word.  The good: -The magnets are strong and stick to the fridge well. - My son loves the design and likes to "fly" it around the house. - It seems to know most, if not all, valid three letter words that are child-appropriate. At least, I haven't found one it doesn't know yet.  The bad: - Sometimes, the sound gets stuck and we have to turn it off and back on (sometimes several times in a row) to get it to work properly again. - It sings the same song EVERY time a word is spelled. I don't think it bothers my toddler, but it's really annoying.  The terrible: - Sometimes, when a letter is already loaded into the first slot and a second letter is placed into the second slot, it misidentifies the second letter. For example, it thinks "t" is "f." That really bothers me and I was hoping it was just a fluke that other reviewers experienced, but mine does the same. This greatly takes away from the educational value of the toy.  It earns a second star because of my son's love of word hunt mode and it's secondary use as a toy plane, but I was pretty close to giving it one star because it just doesn't work the way I think it should.	-1
The 3rd spot on ours says "s" when you put "t" in, and unfortunately t is a letter used in a lot of words.  Not very helpful for learning!  It's been like this since we got it.  We live out of the country part of the year and it's hard for us to return the item, so we've had to keep it this way.  Very frustrating and disappointing for an otherwise great product!	-1
Our first one got lost in a move but it was my daughters FAVORITE toy in the world so I went ahead and got another.  Sadly the 1st letter spot keeps misidentifying letters!!  We have tried to clear it out and loosen up the little buttons but nothing works.  It only gets the letter right about 20% of the time which when my 3 year old knows how to spell Dad and it's telling her she's WRONG it makes her incredibly frustrated!!  Very disappointed especially considering the price of the item!!	-1
Lots of fun, until you run into a bug - won't read the word and makes a repetitive skipping noise. I called Leapfrog, but they no longer make the product and were no help. They also did not offer to replace the product with a similar item. Nor did they have any suggestions on a possible fix. Guess that's why they stopped making this.	-1
As my luck would have it, it looks like I got hit with a lemon. I will try and repair my unit per the instructions in the other reviews and report back.	-1
I wish I paid more attention to these reviews about the letters functioning incorrectly. I thought I'd take my chances and I got what I paid for. It worked correctly for about a month. It would have been a great educational toy if it worked well. I don't want my children thinking an F is a G and Q is an E. There are less letter choices with this toy, but my kids have gotten more accurate play out of it:  Melissa & Doug See & Spell puzzle. I'm really disappointed in leap frog.  Luckily, our fridge phonics still works correctly, but I'm wondering how long I have until that toy starts giving incorrect letters.	-1
Leapfrog has the worst customer service ever!  I received a Leapfrog toy as a gift for my 3-year old and wanted to exchange it for something more advanced, but the customer service center told me I could only exchange a damaged or broken item and only for the exact same item.  I asked for a refund or credit, but they told me they could only apply the credit to my brother's credit card, and I did not want him to find out and feel bad about me exchanging his gift.  The package came with a letter entitled "Returns and Exchanges", but the language does not mention anything about how to exchange a gift or how to do any type of exchange at all.  Completely useless!  I would not buy from this company ever again!	-1
We purchased this product for our oldest son as a 2011 Christmas gift. We have had the toy for 6 months now and our son just started to play with it more frequently. Our son is 3 and we bought the toy to practice spelling with him, however he didn't use it frequent enough to notice that it wasn't working properly. The main problem is the toy doesn't recognize the letters correctly, our son gets very frustrated with the toy because he knows he is right and the toy is WRONG!  We LOVE Leapfrog products; We swear by them and recommend them to other parents any chance we get. However, this is a MAJOR FAIL for the company.  Initially, this problem was detected and it only happened once. It happened when our son put a capital letter in the unit(the capital letters came with the single letter fridge phonics toy) So we figured that the lower case letters(the letters that came with this toy;the word builder) were the only letters that would work for the word builder. We didn't think anything of it and didn't return it.  Recently, I have placed more of a priority on getting my son reading. He knows all of his basic phonics and is learning some of the more complex word blends. So we read the Tag system by Leapfrog together, he plays his Explorer, We also are working on flashcards that he sounds out the word and colors the picture on the back that depicts the word (I add five new words daily) So we began to use the Word Builder more frequently to have him spell words out when we are in the kitchen cooking. It unfortunately didn't work out the way we hoped since it recognizes the letters incorrectly and doesn't even praise him when he spells the words correctly. It is frustrating when he spells a word right and is very excited and the toy tells him what he spelled is not a word.  Since we are passed the time allowed to return the item on Amazon, We contacted Leapfrog directly to see if they could help by replacing the item or tell us how to fix it. They basically told me to clean the green contacts inside each letter spot. Humoring them I did(I know the unit isn't dirty, we haven't even had it long or played with it enough) cleaning it didn't help. It's strange the toy will recognize the letter right consistently for about 3-4 times and then recognize it as something else the next time. So I told them that cleaning those contacts were of no benefit and if they could send us a new one. They responded by giving me 15% off of a purchase on their website and said there was nothing they could do since the item is not within warranty.  After that my husband took it apart, we thought he had fixed it, however unfortunately we did not. BUMMER!  THE REASON I SAY "BUYER BEWARE" IS BECAUSE IF YOU DO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT MAKE SURE EITHER 1)YOUR CHILD IS OF AGE AND READY TO PLAY WITH IT 2) OR YOU PLAY WITH IT A LOT TO MAKE SURE THE TOY THAT IS SENT TO YOU IS NOT DEFECTIVE. I have read reviews where people have absolutely no complaints and others opened a defective toy right out of the box. Contrary to what I thought both the capital and lower case letters have the same contact strips so they are interchangeable and should work fine in this system. Had I known I would have sent it back immediately after the gifts were opened on Christmas and I noticed that it recognized the capital letter he put in it as the wrong letter. Oh well, it's not the first time we wasted 20 bucks, We just NEVER thought we would be disappointed in anything Leapfrog affiliated. Hopefully, they work out the glitches because it really would be a great educational tool if it worked effectively.  (by the way didn't want to give it a bad rating as far as durability because these fridge phonics toys really are durable and withstand the test of our 3,2, and 1 year olds hands! But aren't worth much if they work incorrectly)	-1
Where to start... we have just about every Leap Frog toy ever put out after 2007. Naturally this one would follow the alphabet set one (which was great). I thought it would help my son begin blending the letters into words, but we purchased this DEFECTIVE item before reading the reviews on it. The device won't read the letters correctly. My son puts letters in there thinking he spelled a word correctly. P.O.S.  THEN, I called up the company and wasted 15 minutes getting no where and became extremely frustrated (as you can see I still am). The representative couldn't even spell my name correctly and my first and last name are each 5 letters long and ENGLISH. Bottom line: we're stuck with a crappy toy that doesn't even work and the company can't do anything about it. DO NOT BUY THIS P.O.S.!!!	-1
The item says it is "Word Whammer" but the picture shows the same "FridgeWords" as the other - a stupid newly incompatible gimmick to greedily keep people from using their old letters in combinations or if (oh, how impossible!) a toddler lost a single letter from the old set. This is an vicious marketing trick by a company that doesn't care about customers at all. Can't Amazon at least get it straight and let us know if this is the old or the new version. My review is for Amazon's irresponsible labeling, not for the product, which I don't know if I should buy. I would buy it if I knew it was the compatible WordWhammer. But like everyone else, I wouldn't buy it with the new incompatibility unless I was unethically tricked into it, as so many people have been.	-1
I was secretly hoping that this would entertain and educate my 4yo child without taking up my time.  You definitely need to play this machine with your child if you want your child to learn.  Unfortunately, the voice is very unclear.  "f" sounds like "s".  "hen" sounds like "fen".  Heck, even I have to guess what word/letter the machine is trying to spell or say.  Also, my daughter gets disappointed when she wants to spell words longer than 3 letters and can't.  Can't even spell "zoo" because there's only one "O".  The only good news is that my daughter is paying more attention to spelling and to word/letter sounds than usual.  Otherwise, this toy would only get one star from me.	-1
The first Word Whammer I got for my daughter for Christmas, really excited by the reviews and never having a previous problem with any Leap Frog products. The middle section would only say the letter "A". After a customer service battle with Leap Frog, Amazon.com finally replaced the first one. Now, after minimal use, the only thing that it will do is begin to sing the ABC song, and then get stuck and start to repeat. I'm very disappointed.	-1
This would be a great toy if only it worked properly. It is useless because it reads the letters wrong and the sound quality is poor.	-1
Misleading advertisement. Would not have paid $4 for one tiny ball.	-1
The picture of the product is very misleading so make sure you read the description. Even then, that is wrong.  The picture shows 3 colors that are completely different from the bullet description which states "purple with either red, yellow or green.".  The one I received was purple and orange. Not at all any color that I wanted. Guess it is back to brick and mortar store searching so I can get what I need.  Not worth the money to send back unfortunately.	-1
Very bad quality. Tore on day one!	-1
Bought these to use with the Franklin Sport Shoot Again Basketball Hoop. They were slightly too big and did not fit the return shoot.	-1
Go to the dollar store and pick one up there	-1
the product should say is the soft sleeves ones.. waste of time and money, but for any one that wants soft sleeves then i would recommend i guess	-1
The Ultra Pro Platinum series is a must-skip for any series card game player looking to sleeve his or her deck of cards. The fit is a bit wide, the plastic feels cheap and the fabrication is bad. Example: 1 of my 100 count packs wasn't "cut," which means I had to force many sleeves to open and, not surprisingly, many sleeves did not survive the process. Many of the sleeves that did open ended up 'crunched' which gives your deck a cheap/trashy feel. Skip this product. It's not worth the savings compared to other, better made options.	-1
Thin and cheap	-1
These are the cheap sleeves; the seams rip fairly easily, they are soft, thin and flimsy and provide no rigidity to the cards, shuffling with them is difficult.  If you need sleeves to store your cards in mass quantity, these will suffice.  If you need sleeves for playing, trading, or selling singles I highly recommend you purchase proper 'deck protectors'.	-1
These sleeves broke easily and were really cloudy after a couple of games. I wouldn't really recommend these for games.	-1
Sleeves are very slick and thin. I ripped several while putting them on cards. May as well got penny sleeves at a local shop and saved 3/4 of the price.	-1
I play a lot of boardgames and am constantly looking for sturdy containers to hold game cards.  Unfortunately these boxes are designed for a disappearing genre: baseball card collectors.  They hold baseball cards beautifully, but are often a hairs breadth too small for most game cards.  Ah well, they can at least be used to hold the bits and chits that games often contain.  Hey Ultra Pro:  add an eighth of an inch to the dimensions and you'll open up a wider market.  Ok, at least I'll buy more of these if you did that.	-1
Can't take them apart. Vaccumm effct	-1
My friend invited me over when he picked up this Days of Wonder board game. He is a big-time "euro" gamer and needed someone who was interested in war to come over and help him learn and play this new game (we played several games of Mem. 44 that Sunday morning and below is my review).  First of all;   the art, color palate and game pieces are all first rate. This is no surprise, because Days of Wonder always makes quality FAMILY games. They really do a great job in that department. Typically I don't care for little cardboard "chits" that represent units in most wargames and Mem. 44 has great miniatures that represent those battlefield units. I love this part of the game and a definite draw to play Mem. 44.  The rulebook is well written and everything was very clear (with nice illustrations to help visualize correct rules in practice). How many times have you read a rule book and been frustrated? (probably more times than you can count because it's hard to make a good one).  The box is a great square size and everything fits well. The cardboard is nice and thick and will hold up over time. I can't tell you how many times, I have seen bad boxes for board games! This one is great!  Now the rules and "mechanics" of Mem'44 is odd (to say the least). It is a card based system that gives you limited actions. If you didn't draw a "move left" card, then.... you can't move in that direction. If you didn't draw air support or artillery, then again... no fire support. So often I needed to counter my opponent with moving units to support "X" or "Y", but I didn't have the cards to support it. That would be like playing chess and not being able to do it, because you didn't have the cards or "orders" to do it. It's so frustrating that I was screaming inside my head "Please give me the card to do "X"!" (when I drew up). Nothing felt right.... to the fire of my units to having no morale. I really don't understand why so many people love this Mem. 44 card based system for a wargame, there are so many better rules and systems out there!  I have played many historical miniature games from the Napoleonic period and others... and I have played many wargames on the PC, and I have never had my hands tied so much in a game! How can you play a military commander or General and not be able to control your units? I just don't get it. Maybe this game is supposing your a Lieutenant taking orders from a General (e.g. action cards) where you have so little control? Because that is the only explanation I can hypothesize.  HOWEVER, after all those negative words.... this is a nice little light wargame for children or people who don't know anything about history. It has great text in the rule book to enlighten the non-war (non-historical) public, and that is great. It can be an entry into the genre of wargames too, but honestly this game is NOT for me. If you want to have an enjoyable historic, armchair-general experience, try another game.  So to end, this game is well produced, beautiful, and for the price it's a fairly good value. Just know, it's like playing chess when you were a teenager and your dad sitting behind you... telling you... you can only move knight piece to the left... or the castle piece to "X" location... and that's it! Memoir 44 simply is one extremely frustrating experience after another.  Good luck and game on!  R.M.H.	-1
I guess some people are right to call this a lite wargame. But to me, even as a rookie wargamer, I found it too lite. Basically it felt like i just moved units into obvious spots (cover areas) and throw a die. There seemed very little in the way of options and tactics or counters or flanking. While im sure the many many expansions might add more to options, i didn't go that far with it. While im not afraid of randomness, i found that how the game splits the board into 3 sectors and you had to play cards to move in each sector just meant that this mechanic just limited more of your options. Setup took a while, and even if you have 20 minis or 100 minis on the board the strategy or fun never got better.  If you want a WW2 game where you can use strategy, i recommend go somewhere else. Even if your a noob to wargaming.	-1
I purchased this particular product from Walmart, but since this is a product review & not a seller review, I'm leaving feedback on Amazon as well. This thing is a piece of cr@p. I bought it for my 3 1/2 year old, as a gift from Santa. Thank goodness I didn't wait until Christmas Eve to put it together, because I have to return it & find something else.  Picked it up from the store yesterday & attempted to put it together this morning. 3 of the 4 wheels are broken, a main piece for the bottom support is missing, and the instructions, while not awesome to begin with, want me to put it together so that the handle would be upside down.  Taking it back & getting something with metal wheels.	-1
I was looking for a wagon that would work for a toy for a small child.  The wagon came through with a part of the axle already broken.  If it can break in shipping, how would it perform with a 3 year old?  I was very disappointed in its flimsy design.  I sent it back.	-1
Waste of money.	-1
Save your money. The bottom of the cradle constantly pops out. One of the rocking legs peeled in half but I was able to fix it with wood glue. It looks bad but it still gets played with, at least until the bottom falls out. Again.	-1
This is very cute but it broke almost immediately. It needs delicate handling which it didn't get from its two year old owner. The bottom fell out and could not be reinstalled. Too bad but can not recommend this product.	-1
When I received this product, the paint was chipped and discolored in several places.  It looks really messy, and like I got it at a yard sale instead of new.  I kept it though, to put a doll in for my daughter's birthday, and didn't have time to send it back and get a new one (I didn't actually assemble it until the night before, which was a mistake).  Also, after some use, I found the bottom easily pops out of place.  $25 isn't crazy expensive for a doll cradle, but you still want to get something that at least looks new for your money.  I cannot recommend this item.	-1
A week after Christmas and the bottom has already fallen out. I guess I shouldn't have expected so much from a cheap baby doll crib.	-1
The bottom pops out too easily. My kids shouldn't be standing in it, but it also falls out when they push on it to snuggle a doll up nice and tight. I wish there was some sort of bar underneath to secure it.	-1
As much as I paid for this I was expecting to get real use out of it.  My daughter loved to play with it in the beginning but the bottom board kept falling out.  My husband took it apart and put it back together in high hopes of the board staying in...NOPE!  The "wood" kept chipping each time we would snap the board in place.  Biggest hassle toy ever. Pain in the butt! LOOK ELSEWHERE!	-1
Assembly fairly easy but not good quality the bottom of crib continues to come out toddler girl does not understand it is not her bed super glue needed to reinforce	-1
This cradle is only about 6-8 inches wide!  I have bought it for my daughter's Fisher Price Little Mommy 13" doll and when I put it together and put the doll in it, her arms can't even lay flat.  Also the mattress and pillow are just flat pieces of fabric, but I don't think the doll minds that.	-1
Unlike the pictures, Annie and Clarabelle's facial expression is exactly the same.  I got this set in Dec. 2012.  I didn't think it was a big deal last year, because our son was going on 2 was only obsessed with Thomas and Percy at the time... and I figured he wouldn't even notice. But here we are over half a year later and now he knows EVERY character by name.  He likes to line up all the trains and reenact the real Thomas show and homemade youtube videos.  And these girls always get left out.... or he just grabs one and calls it "annieclare".  So yeah, it's kinda of a pointless set to buy for older kids who are really into the characters themselves.  Follow up:  I painted Annie's gray top with a clear nail polish that had silver glitter in it and gave her a little lipstick and eyeshadow (also using nail polish applied with a toothpick).  He totally knows the difference now.	-1
This product is TERRIBLE.	-1
Garbage	-1
My son plays with it but disappointed it does not work	-1
This device was more headache then it's worth. I was originally going to combine it with my night vision goggles, but I realized that the sound kept getting interference and causing that VERY high pitched loud screeching noise that makes me want to throw it away. Instead, I gave it back to Amazon. Maybe some kid might like being deaf. I also didn't like the handle bar either. It felt very awkward and I wish there was  an automatic shut off device after a certain volume. I heard people talking about that feature, but I apparently never reached that limit... Anyways, the two stars is because it did allow me to hear from a far distance, even though the sound quality was horrible... I mean... I could probably find a cheap digital audio recorder and just amply the sound later and it'll probably give me the same effect.	-1
The concept is great. There are not many products for small children (mine are 2 and 4) that are simple to use and include 2 microphones. The CD skipped often and the volume on the microphone is way too loud. You can't even hear the music. Ours only lasted 7 months, with only occasional use, before the CD player stopped working.	-1
Great player, BUT the microphones stopped working. It would be worth $50 if everything worked.	-1
Bought this for my daughters birthday and she absolutely loved it. Unfortunately it only worked for 6 months and then would no longer play a cd. $50 is way too much to spend on a toy that only lasts 6 months!	-1
Same as several others, I see - my boys loved this, until it stopped working. :( It was a gift and I didn't keep the packing receipt or box; how do I go about getting a refund?	-1
My granddaughter loved it up until it broke.  After just a few months the peg the disc fits onto broke off.  In all honesty it did get bumped and dropped a few times but I would have expected that a toy designed for a child this age woud withstand bumps and drops of no more than a foot from the floor.  Considered ordering her another since she loved it so much but at the price can't justify replacing it every 3 months.	-1
Leap pad ac adaptor works! Our cd player quit after 1 week. It still won't work with battereries  and was ready to throw it out. I thought maybe it would work with a power cord? I didn't want to waste money on purchasing an adaptor so decided to try our power cord from the leap pad 2 and like magic it works! Still mad about the batteries not working but at least i can plug it in. I still think this product is lacking in quality... It skips when my daughter dances near it and hard to put cds in and take out because door barely opens ( think less than 45 degree angle) and for the price should include an adapter but maybe the manufacturer does not want a child toy that "plugs in". Just wanted to inform others that their leap pad power cord works great so no need to spend more cash.	-1
What a piece of junk. The item does not work at all. Absolutely avoid. I should have paid attention to the other reviews. Not sure where the company's quality assurance is they must have been sleeping that day. Real cheap that you have to buy an adapter on the side especially for $50. I'm sorry did I forget to say it's a piece of junk?	-1
This works ok- but for the money I did not expect it to stop and retrack so often. We put it on the table and don't touch it and it still stops for about 15 sec(a lifetime when your trying to sing along) and then resumes. But my grandson loves the microphone.	-1
It broke within 3 weeks of purchasing. Its not nearly as ruggged as advertised.	-1
It's a good thing this is made for kids who have short memories, because it only lasted a few months.  Very disappointed 3 year old on our hands as she was so excited to unwrap this at Christmas.  It was a lot of fun while it worked.  But didn't last long.  Another gripe is that the cd doesn't open all the way so you can imagine how that works out for toddlers.  Also, it rips through batteries so the plug-in cord should come standard. Also, toddlers constantly bump into it and the CD ended up skipping all the time.  Terribly dissapointed.	-1
I expected a higher quality CD player.  This was the most expensive and my grand daughter also received a less expensive "Miss Kitty" CD player from her other grandma which turned out to be of much higher quality.  We kept this one only as an alternative but definitely wouldn't purchase again.	-1
I purchased this for my son who at the time was 3.  It lasted not even a year.  It was not dropped or mishandled in anyway that I ever witnessed and the entire insides are shaking around in it.  I am beyond disappointed and mad that I spent the amount of money I did on this and my youngest can not enjoy it now.  I saw another consumer called the manufacturer and I can not for the life of me find the information to do so.	-1
My daughter had fun with this when it worked. It would constantly stop playing and it hadn't been touched or anything, just stop. It was a constant frustration. My husband is technical savvy and still couldn't figure out why it would just stop. It was very frustrating and my daughter finally got so that she wouldn't use it anymore. Had it worked, it would have been great. If only...	-1
My preschooler used this 2 times and the CD player stopped working, she did not move it, I just pressed stop and play while she used the mic.  Once she got slavia into the mic it stopped working too until it dried out, this frustrated her since the mic was the favorite part.  So I sent it back and they fixed it and sent it back to us.  It worked 1 time this time and then stopped again.  I sent it back again and asked for a new one.  They sent a new one and we used it one afternoon for a few hours, didn't use it for 2 weeks, tried it again today and it doesn't work!  I am done, just lost $50 on it (at least I got it on sale!)	-1
Hi, I am on the 3rd one of these CD-players in 4 month. My son loves it, it's the first thing he turnes on in the morning and the last toy he turns off at night. That's the only reason why I keep trying. The first of these CD-players played 3 or 4 CD's once each, then it was no longer able to read them. I went back to the store and exchanged it a week after my son got it for his 2nd birthday. The next CD-player started the same problem 2 month after the exchange, first I thought it's the occational scratch on one or two CDs but by the 4th month it didn't read any CD's anymore. The seller told me that they will not exchange the item another time. I think that 4 month for a $69.99 item is a bit stiff. The CD-player comes with no manufacturer's warranty. Otherwise great item, looks great, my son learned to sing tons of songs and talkes about "lissening to Mozart and Vivaldi". The CD-player has has an anti shock system but that was never needed in our household. My toddler learned to operate the player in minutes. The other downside is that there is no locking mechanism for the CD compartment, so we had to teach the kid not to touch the CDs. I really hope that this 3rd CD-player holds up longer, it breaks my son's heart not to be able to turn on his music.	-1
We asked for this for Christmas for our 3-yr old music-loving son. Grandparents were happy to buy it, and while it worked, my son loved it. The cd player is easy to use. So were the microphones, until, one by one, they broke within the first weeks of use. There was a poor connection from microphone to cd player to start with. Then one stopped working. We let it go because the other microphone still worked, but in a few weeks, that one went, too. He didn't use or play with it roughly, although the machine says it's made to be kid-tough. Apparently the cd player IS, but the microphones/their connections are definitely NOT. A big disappointment.	-1
This was a Christmas gift for my 2 year old, so she could listen to her Fraggle and In the Night Garden cd's during quiet time. Worked fine for about a month, and now the power button won't stay engaged. A piece of packing tape kinda fixes the problem, but for that kind of money, I shouldn't have to. It will become pretty useless when she's a bit older and wants to carry it around. So for now it sits on her dresser, for use once a day. I could have gotten a cheap plug-in cd player for about a quarter of the price. Really dissapointed. Oh, and it sucks batteries. So yeah, I wouldn't get this if I were you!	-1
I asked my mother-in-law to buy this for my 3 1/2 year old twin girls for Christmas because it had awesome reviews.  She ordered it at the beginning of November.  We played it once on Christmas morning, then went to play it later and it didn't work.  Of course we were way past Amazon's 30 day return period, so I emailed the company.  They responded immediately.  They said they would send FedEx to pick it up and they would fix it or replace it.  They sent us a replacement quickly, within a month.  This is the only reason I give it two stars instead of one.  I hate the darn thing.  The microphone cords are so tightly coiled that if one of my kids goes to use it they pull the whole player off the counter, floor, or shelf it was sitting on and it crashes to the floor.  Other than that, the microphones themselves work quite well.  The "hold" button works on only a few things.  It does NOT work with the power button, so my kids can turn it off then scream for me to come turn it back on.  The shock protection also does not work worth a crap.  I would never buy this again.  I would probably buy something else from the company since the repair service was efficient, but not this.  Sadly, we never use it.  It was a waste of money.	-1
We bought this for our three year old for Christmas.  He loves to sing and dance.  The product LOOKS durable and very nice.  However, it never played a CD.  It wouldn't spin.  We tried several things but gave up.  Amazon returned the item through UPS with no problem.  We weren't able to do an exchange though since it was through a third party seller.	-1
Just 40 pieces are too less to create bigger and better formations. Price is on the higher side. Many other options to keep little ones busy are available for this price.	-1
The ends fell off.	-1
FELL APART AFTER 1 HOUR OF PLAYING WITH IT, THE CORE FELL OUT, TOTALLY CHEAP AND LOW QUALITY, WILL RETURN	-1
It lasted only four days. It was my little brother's Christmas present and he is very sad about it, and to make him fell better we will send it back ''. Possibly the worst nerf football in your line, but I love the guns but not this football.	-1
Quality not good	-1
The board is big but the coins and the dice are too tiny. Even the numbers on board is hard for little kids to find.and the snake's mouth is little confusing for kids to see which box it is in.	-1
This is a precious stuff animal.  It's soft and fluffy, but day 2 of being gently played with and one of the seams already has a tear.  Didn't expect much since it's inexpensive, but did expect it to last longer than 2 days.	-1
The description for this unicorn did not say that it makes noise. Other reviewers say that the unicorn can be washed and it is huggable. I just received the unicorn in the mail for my 3 year old and although it is cute (different colors than what is pictured), it has a big sound box that takes up the entire middle of the unicorn. It makes a loud horse sound and it is so easy to have it make the noise that my daughter would not be able to sleep with this toy because it will be "neighing" every time she moves! The sound box cannot be removed and so this toy cannot be washed and it is not at all huggable! I'm wondering if the person sent me the wrong unicorn. I will definitely be returning it.	-1
I actually bought this for my daughter its good quality, but i hoping it was medium sized stuffed animal but it wasnt. its really small.	-1
More difficult that I expected.  It is difficult to pull the needle through the holes so my 7 year old isn't able to do it by herself which was what I was looking for.	-1
Too much force is required to get the plastic needle through the holes in the foam. My child could not do it, so I did it for her, but I had to push so hard that I became worried I would break the needle. This was a pain for me and not fun for my child. The finished products are cute though.	-1
It came apart	-1
It broke during the first time of use.	-1
good and fun idea but not very sturdy at all. Really can't recommend this at all.	-1
Just like the others said...I bought 3 and all 3 were broken in different ways upon arrival, such poor quality.	-1
this item is not packaged well for such a fragile item.  I purchased several of these, and so far I have had 3 broken upon arrival.  The puzzle itself is a great one, so I just could not put 1 star.	-1
Fell apart within 5 minutes of use. This item is made out of very cheap plastic.	-1
The product was received broken. Very bad quality. Do not purchase.	-1
Arrived broken. Sending back. Just a fun gift to spice up a boring money gift but it was super cheap, dollar store quality.	-1
We got this for my one year old son because he loved playing with his big sister's doll house from the same line of toys.  The doll house has a variety of sound effects, which was his favorite part of playing with it.  However, the castle only has one effect - when you press on the flag, the king's chair swings around while a trumpet sound plays - that's it.  My son continues to play with the doll house and my daughter uses the castle for her Disney princess figurines, so I guess everyone is happy anyway!	-1
Was really excited to give this to my son for Christmas. It came in the package broken so couldn't even put it together for him. He is really upset. I wouldn't suggest buying this only based on the fact that it came broken in the box but the box wasn't damaged. Not sure if it's worth the price put together since I couldn't even do that.	-1
It came broken.  I gave it two stars because I had no problem getting a refund.	-1
Ordered 3.  Every one is broken!	-1
Very cheap looking. Got 3. Two arrived broken.	-1
terrible!  when the ball is at the end of the one I received the slot is too tight for the ball to fit.  Once opened the door would not stay closed again. Terrible product	-1
Cheap quality.  Came broken.  Not worth the price to return it.  Just threw it away.  Would not recommend anyone to buy this.	-1
Very bad product. Cheaply made. Won't buy again. We bought it for Christmas and its broken now we have to figure something else out.	-1
This really was a cheap toy. When I received it, I opened the box and one side of the cube fell off! Wasn't even glued in place! the plastic on this cube is really brittle. I feel like I'm gonna break it more. Was gonna use it for the holidays but now I'm afraid to! I have bought a 1 other money cube from another place and its quality was 60 times better. From now on I'll buy from there. Don't waste your money. It took 5 weeks to ship to the USA, then the darn things falls apart upon opening!	-1
I was so disappointed in this product. The idea is fabulous,and it would be great if it were well made. This product, unfortunately, is poorly made. The product states for ages 3+. Well, after a few minutes with it, my 6 year old was done trying, and my 6 year old loves marble mazes. The maze is too complex for a young child as you have to maneuver through 6 panels, without messing up. I even had to use the cheat, that is printed on the box, to avoid spending my entire day trying to figure it out. When you do finally get to the end, you have to manually open it. The marble doesn't actually do anything to unlock it, which I think, is misleading for this product. You can unlock without moving the marble anywhere. After unlocking it, another unexpected reaction happened. All the panels fall out, and it is quite a headache to put the panels back in the proper way. The plastic is also cheap. I thought this was going to be great to use for Christmas. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.	-1
This is chincy, it comes apart easily and is made of cheap plastic. It is not worth the money.	-1
Did not work.	-1
This says (set of 2) but when I received it, there is only one in the box! Buyer beware!!!	-1
couldn't figure out how to open it.	-1
It arrived broken, plastic was shattered in two places and I wasn't able to receive a new one because it was an add on item	-1
Super cheaply built. But for five bucks for something to put cash in for a gift, it was tons of fun. Bought four of them and handed them out to ages 18-10, fun to watch everyone work hard for their bday cash!  The latch sticks easily and you can tell it's cheap plastic, but worked for what I needed.	-1
Had a lot of difficulty with these, ordered 10 of them after reading reviews just so I would get at least a few that worked right.  The problem we had was once the ball is in place to open the door it doesnt without a significant smack, the plastic tab is poorly made and the weight of the ball is not enough to make it open with ease, even with a smack its a 50/50 as to whether it will open or not.  I would recommend something else, it is inexpensive but its also not very functional.  Im pretty sure you will be disappointed.	-1
Awful.  Bought for small kids gift to add $$$ to. Just a fun addition. So cheap it breaks out of the box!  The top is t attached!  The "maze" doesn't stay together!  No challenge there!  And I was suckered into 2 of these. How barraging to use as a gift for a 10 yo.  What a disappointment!	-1
don't waste your time I just never bothered to return it wasn't worth the postage	-1
Its ok ...but a bit filmsy and the lock falls apart easily	-1
The steel ball becomes stuck in certain places and cannot be dislodged.	-1
Come on... i was hoping for something decent  at the very least.. i mean 4 days til xmas eve and not only money wasted but wasted those 2 days waiting for it rather than gone out for something that i can actual hand as a gift.cheap plastic box came as to what appears.brokenn. 2 rows of the maze loose broken inside the box.. ANNOYED AND UPSET !	-1
This is made from cheap plastics and had a corner broken off when I received it. I did not use it for the gift I had planned on. Instead, I dropped it off at Goodwill.	-1
Broke before I could even give as a gift.  The ball got stuck and we can not get it unstuck.	-1
cheap piece of junk. I bought 5 of them. 2 of them broke almost immediately.	-1
came broken	-1
This is made out of very cheap plastic. It broke after the first use. Had it only cost me $1 I would have been ok with it.	-1
The instructions are very vague.  They did not explain how to lock the door.  I was able to lock the door upon reviewing a YouTube video.  However, the door is easily forced to open to access gift.	-1
I got this to put my little brother and sister's Christmas money in.  I thought it would be fun to add some candy pieces and what not for them also.  The problem is the little lid that you have to unlock using the maze and ball pops right off if you put anything with any weight in the cube and then shake it upside down.  If you're just putting a few bills or a check this won't happen, but if you're putting anything with more weight it's much to easy to cheat it open.	-1
I can't really provide much info on the puzzle itself because mine was broken in transit, but then that speaks to the quality of the product...  Looking at it, the difficulty might have been ok, but I'm not sure the latch would function properly every time and it looks like it could be opened with a well-placed bump.  Maybe if it isn't broken, it would be a fun little gift, but damage durring transit seems to be common, so it's a gamble.  I'd steer clear.  There are better puzzle box gifts available.	-1
Bought two of these for Christmas.  The lid latches, but can be flicked off with a fingernail or it you shake it upside down.  Great concept, but really needs a better latch.	-1
I gave two of these to my 8 year old grandson, and he liked it.  The latch assembly however failed on both units and are now unworkable.	-1
I bought three of these, only 1 worked, the other two were broken.  Very cheap puzzle box but a nice alternative to just giving cash.  **UPDATE** After putting money/gift cards into the maze puzzle box and making sure the ball was far away so it would not be immediately found, I wrapped them and gave them as gifts.  As soon as the recipients opened them, the flap opened and that was that.  The remaining two puzzle boxes opened up without having to go through the maze.  Great concept, but cheaply made and not worth the money. If the box was made with thicker plastic and the top was able to be secured better, it would be a great product.  You get what you pay for.	-1
You get what you pay for!  Very cheep !  Didn't even work and not worth sending back!  Might as well just throw your money in the trash .  Which is what I did with this maze.	-1
Not only are all these cube mazes the same, I bought two from each company, thinking they would be different. The sellers must buy them from the same supplier. One of them had a blocked passage that the ball needed to use to complete the maze.	-1
I wasn't expecting much, but this is beyond cheesy. The little trap door broke after the first time I used it. I would gladly pay more for a puzzle maze box that was made a little better.	-1
I bought both this maze and a Bilz Obstacle money maze and it was clear how much better quality the Bilz one was.  I don't exactly know where this was made, but their Quality Control is sub-par, as there was actually a HAIR INSIDE THE MAZE when I opened the package.  Since it was INSIDE there was no way of me getting it out.  This is a really cool concept, though.  There are many other products like this, so I'd recommend going with a different company.	-1
I ordered this for my nephew, who only ever wants gift cards for any birthday or Christmas.  I thought it would be fun to make him work for it! The box opening was too small for the card I bought (a XBox live gift card). I ended up cutting the gift card, so I hope that didn't mess it up! Also, it door barely closed, even with the card cut way down.  I found it pretty cheap.  I have my doubts that it will even actually work, am looking forward to seeing if my nephew can actually do it.  If not, I guess he could take a saw to the plastic... I hope it doesnt come to that, but I have my doubts of its functionality.	-1
I have never in almost 50 purchases from Amazon returned ANYTHING, until this piece of junk came!  This is a VERY cheaply made item!  The lock does not work!  You can open the box no matter where the ball is in the puzzle.  What is the point of doing the puzzle if you can just open it when ever you want??  Looks like all the good reviews where 2-3 years ago & maybe there was a better product being sold at that time, but now, very very unacceptable.  I had purchased for my 10 yr olds birthday, may as well just hand him the money, because this is basically just a money holder not a puzzle to get the money out.	-1
This thing is so cheap.  Definitely don't pay $25 for it like I did.  Not worth it, at all.  Parts don't even stay together on mine, and it's only 3 months old.	-1
Never received my plush. This makes me very sad, as it look so cute! I purchased a totoro around the same time.. received it, and love it! Its too bad the customer service is no help either.	-1
Please pay close attention to the dimensions of this product. It is TINY. I was looking for a sandbox toy for a three year old and thought a die cast toy would last. Could hardly believe my eyes when this thing arrived. It's just a bit bigger than a hotwheel! This item should not be listed under toys. Returned it immediately.	-1
Cheap knock off totoro.	-1
I've purchased this item in Japan, and wanted two others after returning to the USA.  The ones received with Prime shipping were a bit smaller, lumpier, and made with lower quality materials.  They have chains on the top, which my legitimate Japanese Totoro doesn't have.  The sewn-on tags were slightly different; one was backward and upside down.  Still cute, but I didn't want cheap knockoffs.	-1
I'm so disappointed because i thought it was a small plush but turns out its a key chain and no where did I read that it was a keychain. Its eyes seem a bit messy too. I hate it so much.	-1
My daughter love it, but honestly it's very expensive for what it is.  It's very small and it has nothing else what you see in the picture.	-1
Looks good but a seam split and he lost an eye within a week. Pay more for one that is better quality. Better yet, get a real one.	-1
These are sturdy and seemingly well made. However, they are very slippery. Countless kids have complained and fallen when trying to navigate these. I will have to apply grip tape (used for tennis racquets) to make them usable. Already fixed to our climbing cave ceiling, so their not going to be returned or replaced.	-1
I got what I paid for. Cheap, thin seats. Very cheap chains.	-1
Chains are too short	-1
This really is the best version of Risk for me, but the componet quality of the small box edition is shoclingly bad. I had the original, but never got it back after lending it, so bought this as a replacement. The moon and energy tokens are cornflake box cardboard, whats more the energy tokens are now only printed on one side. (Originally both).  Yes you can still play, but it cheapens what was a great game.	-1
... Barbie must be horribly lonely in her dream mansion with Ken running around in the woods like this.	-1
These balloons and air from the pump stink. YES, the balloons absolutely reek of chemicals.  Same is true of air discharged from the pump.  How these got past the EPA, let alone OSHA and CPA is beyond me, but the odor is enough to require hazmat containment.  I would not put these balloons or pump within a mile of children.	-1
This is a fun toy. The way the balloons fly around is fun to watch and the sound they make is just hilarious, especially for young kids. BUT the pump broke within the first 10 fills. We superglued it back together and it lasted another 5 fills or so. Also, maybe it's just us or just the pump we received as no one else has mentioned it, but we found the pump required A LOT of strength to fill the balloons. So much so that it was much easier to fill them with our mouths. No way our daughter could do it on her own.  Like others, we had issues with some of the balloons: several had holes and could never be filled, others tore easily on their first flight around the room. But there were many good balloons in the bunch too.  If the pump were easier to use and didn't break so readily, this could easily be played with for hours at a time. As it stands, we're tired after 10 minutes or so. I can't give it more than 2 stars.	-1
I purchased the rocket balloon from TJD Toys and it was shipped by Amazon. So, I received the item in a timely manner. But, the balloon pump fell apart after one week of use. The top portion of the pump disconnected from the bottom part. I guess the glue that held the parts together was too weak. Great toy but the balloon pump was not well made. I was very disappointed. I mailed the item back for a refund.	-1
If gundam had generic suits, this would be it. Its plain, ugly & boring Instead of a gundam head it has some pilot helmet. Whats the point if these lazy suits?	-1
We bought this for our 1 year-old who still likes to put things in the mouth as most 1 year-olds do.  The hook on this tow truck is a hazard.  My child put the hook in her mouth and it got caught.  She was panicked and pulling on it to get it out as I was rushing over to her.  When I got there I took the hook out and it had punctured the inside of her cheek.  It was not a serious wound and she was fine, but I have put the truck away because I don't want to find out how serious it could be.  I would not recommend this truck, instead get a different one without a hook.	-1
We wanted a small slide we could keep in the house for winter because my daughter loves climbing and sliding. We thought this would be great. It was out of the box about 10 minutes before I decided to send it back. There is a thing underneath that connects the slide part to the steps to stabilize it that I couldn't get to latch at all. It wouldn't spread out far enough to get it latched. I tried letting my daughter play on it without it, but, like other reviewers found, it is too steep and the stairs are right on top of eachother instead of graduated. My daughter (who is a very adept climber and slider) couldn't climb the steps without a great deal of assistance and once she got to the top, I had to pick her up and set her down on the top because she couldn't get seated to slide down. After two tries, she got very very frustrated and threw a fit. She normally can do jungle gyms at play grounds on her own, climbing steps and sliding down slides with no problems, so I figure this shouldn't be so difficult for her. If your child is younger than 3, I would say this would be too hard for them to handle even though the age on the box is 1 and 1/2. Back to the drawing board. It would be nice to have something inside for her to climb because it's going to be a long winter!	-1
This slide was puchased for a 15 month old.  My complaint with this slide is that it is virtually impossible for a small child to walk up and slide down this slide. An adult has to put them on the top of the slide and slide them down.  This is due to the fact that the bottom step is located directly below the next step up.  If you notice,  all correctly engineered slides have graduated steps.  The only step a child sees on this slide when walking up or trying to walk back down the steps is the top step, the bottom step is virtually invisible being completely underneath the top step (there are only two steps).  So the child tries to lift their leg onto a step which is too high.  Then the top side rails are very low and the slide is pitch waaaaay too steeply.  Horrible engineering.  And a cautionary note: if the child tries to slide down the slide with bare feet, their feet will stick to the slide and pitch them right off into the air.  This actually happened, luckily while I was holding onto the toddler, but otherwise I'm sure she would have been hurt. I can't imagine that this has not happened many times to other children. I would never purchase this slide again.  The child really enjoys sliding, but I would definitly purchase a different model.  I'm getting pretty disgusted with Little Tikes toys.	-1
This playhouse is actually inferior to the little tikes 6-in-1 town center, and I want to know why I can't find it to purchase. I've emailed little tikes just now to ask.  That one has shelves for the kids to put their little toys and trinkets. The market side had real places to put some groceries. The kitchen had a fridge that opened and a little sink.  My feeling is this one is cheaper to make. But if you think about it, it's all really just drawn on the walls. For the money, shouldn't there actually be more it can do, as opposed to walls that you all are coloring?	-1
This appears to be a really fun outdoor toy, and it does have a lot of play value.  However, it is not overly durable if you use it as an outdoor toy.  The stickers that come with the playhouse quickly peeled off within a few months of play.  This was disappointing, because they really added to the decor of the playhouse.  The plastic shutters ended up cracking and one shutter fell off...plus the color of the shutters turned very yellow and foggy over time.  The basketball netting also did not last and frayed very quickly.  My children (3 & 5) loved the store side of the house, and would hand out food to mom and dad all day long.  They also enjoyed using the gasoline pump to fuel their bicycles and john deere tractors.  The creativity of the toy is fun, but I would recommend keeping this indoors to maintain the appearance of the playhouse.  I would also forego using the stickers if you are going to put the playhouse outside.	-1
I bought this for my son who is in Boy Scouts because he and his fellow Scouts love to play card games during their monthly campouts that occur in all kinds of weather.  Often times their cards will get soaked rendering them useless so I figured this would be the perfect solution to that.  These cards are indeed waterproof, they are made of plastic.  Unfortunately they are so slick that it is hard to keep them in your hand and shuffling them is a hassle because the cards constantly slip out while you shuffle causing them to go everywhere.	-1
Too Small	-1
Tiny tiny tiny	-1
I guess I didn't read the specs on this one.  Really small ball.  My one year old boys can't find half the time. Dont think I would buy again.	-1
The photo IS misleading, as very few baby toys would be made to such small specifications. It's really teeny.  So much so, that despite the age specifications on the product features--"For ages 12 months and up"--there is a choking warning further down that states,  "WARNING: CHOKING HAZARD -- Small parts. Not for children under 3 yrs". It would seem that even the manufacturer is confused about the size.  Of course, I didn't find any of this until later, as I would assume many people didn't. And when one is in the middle of Christmas shopping for nieces, nephews, kids, parents, grandparents, spouses--occasionally, reading the specifications, (something I almost always do)--falls to the wayside. Thankfully, we always have the opportunity to check the item before we give it. So, I won't be wrapping up a choking hazard for my 13 month old nephew.  I will be sending back all of my Wonderworld toys, and I wish I had read the other reviews stating size issues--it would save me the hassle of now having to pay shipping and go shopping elsewhere.  Other than that, it's an "okay" toy. I think other eco-friendly and organic toymakers provide better craftmanship and usability.	-1
This toy is extremely dangerous! PLEASE don't give it to your baby! We got it for our 7 month old and a few days after he got it, I saw that one of the wooden rings and a little guy came completely loose and were laying on the floor, within my baby's reach. The little "guy" from inside of this toy is a perfect size to get lodged in the baby's throat and cause chocking. The way this toy is constructed this is not something that MAY happen under some bizarre circumstances, but rather something that is LIKELY to happen during a normal play with the toy. Amazon must know this, since they posted a "chocking hazard" sign about this toy. I feel that this is not enough, and they should discontinue selling this toy, especially that the name of the toy (peek-a-boo) implies it is for babies! No child under 5 years old should be given this toy, and a kid that is 5 will not be interested in it. What is Amazon gonna say to a parent of a kid who choked and died because of this toy-???- "Oh, sorry, we did gave a warning on our webpage"- ???!!!	-1
This is the size of a racquetball and the little pieces (those little heads are about the size of a pencil end) will only come out from gravity - meaning they only pop out on the side that is facing away from the baby!	-1
The good:  Easy to learn/play  The bad: I expected this game to have a lot of player interaction like, (bluffing, misleading), but it don't. This game is more like monopoly (you will need a banker) without the cruelty.  Eventually the game just becomes an item collecting game. I was bore with it after 10 minutes.	-1
I'm returning this. It's a very small box with mostly asian typeset I cannot understand. It's not at all what I thought I was getting from the picture. Sorry.	-1

We purchased this product for our 10 yrs old son who was enthusiastically looking forward to receiving it in order to create his 5th grade WWII project.  We were all shocked once we opened the boxes to find miniscule pieces of green soldiers needing to be assemble which clearly will not look like the image portrayed.  To make matters worse, the instructions for assembly are written in Asian language.  To summarize, we are horribly disgusted and  disappointed.  Sena Family	-1
Unless you are a dedicated model maker, this is not for the casual builder. Tried to start to put it together with my grandson and was just overwhelmed and it is still 95 percent undone in the box somewhere in the house.	-1
well the first time I ordered it the package arrived with missing and broken pieces plus the shipping and the model box was smashed also. But when I tried to return it the company "Tamiya" gave me the run around about replacing the model. Eventuality I hade to contact Amazon to get it replaced when Amazon had to get strict with them about replacing the model	-1
Very cheap not worth it.	-1

As a mom of 2 little girls I am a big fan of barbie's new princess line. The last one Princess Anneliese and Erika were amazing.  I bought both dolls, plus the castle for my girls.  I was very sad to see Princess Anneliese and Erika sold out of stock and production only to be replaced by fairytopia dolls.  These fairy dolls promote immodesty.  The producers of immodest clothing are targetting younger and younger ages these days.  I would never buy this doll because I don't want to promote a dress that has no straps or sleeves, is low cut, and extremely short.  Walking through Target my 4 year old told me that she wanted to dress up like Elina.  Instead I would prefer to buy her an Erika dress since my other daughter has an Anneliese dress.  However, Erika dresses are not available anymore.  I saw this movie on Nickelodeon and one thing that I like about the movie is that Elina is different from the other fairies and in the end her alone standing up made a difference in whether or not fairytopia was taken over.  Well, we need to stand up for those things that are good and not let the media dictate how we should dres scantilly, etc.  Women should dress to be respected.  I have found that when we dress with class there is more respect for ourselves and woman is not seen as someone to be belittled.  I think Mattel should keep a positive reputation.  We are targetting young innocent little girls here.	-1
poor value	-1
npt at all what advertised	-1
I bought this for my son and the head fell off within an hour of opening the box and will not go back on right. It also has very sharp corners. It is a cute robot, but that doesn't matter if it is in pieces...	-1
my grandson wanted the diego skateset so me his grandmom order it for him it for it took forever to come and the skate fix on any shoe sneaker or slipper just sock but it was to short for toe to go in the pocket the kneepad or the arm pad fix it was acheaptoy which it costed $19.00the tls was25.in some cahange this skate is one of the worse gift i purchase for x-mas gift	-1
I really like the idea of a roller blade version for my son, so I purchased them for his 3rd birthday.  Bad idea!  The design is somewhat flawed.  My son only wears about a size 8-8 1/2 sneaker, but I had a terrible time putting on the skate.  The sneaker was such a tight fit, that it took several minutes just to insert past the opening whilst fully enlarged.  I don't even think his sneakers are extra-bulky, they are a medium width Sketcher low top.  I consider these a waste of money as my son will not get much use out of them.  With each new size sneaker, width gets added, and there is no way a wider sneaker would fit easily into this hard plastic.  I suggest the regular toddler skate with 2 straps.	-1
Picked this up after the enticing commercials my 3.5 yr old saw ... and returned it the day after.  Definitely not worth the price (...)!  Pieces kept falling off, we couldn't get the saddle to stay on and most of the prongs were not long enough to hold any of the pieces.  Other times we could load the horse up and it wouldn't buck at all!  Save your money for something other than this plastic gem.	-1
We got this for our daughter when she was 6 and she was so excited.  While so many said it never bucks, ours bucked if you breathed on it.  The first time we set it up, she was just about to put a piece on, hadn't even gotten within 3 inches and it bucks - Loudly.  It scared her, but we tried it again, this time with my husband doing it.  He barely touched it when it bucked.  This happened repeatedly, it was no fun at all because no one could ever get anything on the horse before it was bucking.  It wasn't all that easy to reset into the starting position either.  What a waste, this game is a stinker.	-1
We got this game for Christmas and thought that it would bring alot of fun and challenge. There is definitely no challenge to it. I agree with some of the other reviewers in that the horse never bucks regardless of level. Unless you press it as hard as you can to make it buck. Too easy to put stuff on and no fun in the end.	-1
Arrived with the horn broken off.  I sent it back. It was very pretty and would have been perfect if it wasn't damaged.	-1
This lioness is absolutely gorgeous on the site but when you see it in person, the details aren't as distinct... I was truly disappointed as this was apart of a gift for my father on Father's Day... Also the piece is really small in comparison to the other pieces sold by Papo.,	-1
Very disappointing product. Motor is obnoxious, planet revolution around sun all exactly the same way so a year is the same on all planets (the planets revolve as a unit), no way to fix planets in place so kid keeps making them overlap accidentally. The constellation projection from our dining table to 9 foot ceiling is blurry, can't read the letters at all. Unsure how this product got any good reviews at all...	-1
Junk! Rings of Saturn don't stay on. Metal rods that attach the planets aren't fully straight.  Planets look NOTHING like the actual planets. Cheap junk for a high price.  I gave it one star only because it functions.	-1
looks good in picture. but kid got bored with in after 1 or 2 play. a bit waste of money...	-1
Several came broken, or they broke very quickly. Would not repurchase.	-1
We got these as a gift for my 3 year old.  He loves art and has lots of other crayons and markers. Positives: bright, smooth coloring, nice to work with. Negatives: not washable and they smear all over his hands, then it transfers on everything, even after hand washing. A bath resolved the staining, it makes these limited use for us.	-1
Meh.	-1
Makes a lot of noise when running. Stars do not show up on ceiling which really disappointed my four year old (he is used to his turtle glow light that displays the stars). Rings do not stay on plant. Would not buy it again	-1
I thought these would be great for my 2 year old because she was often accidentally breaking her crayons or picking the paper off. instead she just twisted the crayons all the way up and took them out completely :( didn't solve my problem.	-1
i would give it 1 star. i'm giving 2 only because my son liked it. well, why i didn't like it: 1. as you can see in other comments, the planets are moving at the same rate (which is WRONG!!!) 2. as you can see in other comments, the colors of the planets do NOT correspond to the reality (they SHOULD look like we are used to) 3. neither the batteries, nor the adapter are included, so you SHOULD BUY them. 4. the "sun" does NOT close well, so its upper part falls all the time. 5. the "stardome" that is supposed to "convert the unit to a planetarium" does not really do that because you can hardly see the stars (and especially their names on the ceiling).  so for my 4 years old boy, who just learned the planets and knows they go around the sun, it's interesting, but it is NOT educational at all since it has too many wrong things.	-1
Not what I'd hoped for. I bought this unit for my son to explain orbital mechanics a bit and have fun with the planets. The disappointment that all the planets move at the same rate is really a killer. I mean how hard would it really have been to do some simple gears to slower down some and speed up others. It didn't have to perfect but could have been so much more. The other disappointment is the covers on the sun. I had hoped that the constellations might show up on a ceiling to teach him something about their positions. But, as you can guess from what I'm leading into they aren't visible at all. So what exactly is the point of the replaceable domes?  The market has a huge hole in my opinion for this kind of teaching device. It doesn't have to be perfect or accurate really it just has to explain the basics and be usable. Oh yea, and if you could paint the planets their ACTUAL COLORS that would be great. There isn't exactly a lack of pictures to get them close, especially this planet called Earth. I challenge you to take it off the unit and mix it with Neptune and Uranus and see if your kid can pick Earth. It's that poorly painted.	-1
Item did not work and the "stems" for the planets were weak and did not hold up the planets and bent. If the motor/sun did work, the planets would not be able to go around. The item was a big disappointment. I give one star for them including Pluto.	-1
Don't do it... no really. Don't.	-1
This toy is very cheaply made. It uses C bateries but not indicated anywhere in the box ormanuals. The sun is made of two piece cheap plastic that don't fit together properly, so, one part keeps falling off unless you tape it with clear tape. The planets are outside the range of light so there are no useful shadows. The rotation produces a fairly laud motorized sound. Also the bulb burned in less than an hour and the fact that it came with an extra bulb, does mean that you can expect the second bulb to burn in no time as well. Ultimately, this toy is a lame waste of money, a good idea with lausy production from China that really belong to the shelves of a "DOLAR STORE".	-1
My daughter and I followed the directions for hatching these sea monkeys to a "T", a ton hatched and we were super excited! Like probably 20 or more we could see swimming around after day 2. By the 3rd morning after dumping in the eggs nearly all of them had died. By the fourth there were 3 little sea monkeys left....This morning (day 5 and the first day you are supposed to feed them) no sea monkeys!!! I stirred the water everyday to ass oxygen, I kept them in a sunny window.....???????? What a bunch of crap! Won't be ordering again. My daughter was highly disappointed!!!	-1
I had under 5 of these sea monkeys hatch and they all died within a couple days.  I have used this same brand but purchased elsewhere before and had great luck with them so I don't know if this was an older/defective kit but I would not purchase sea monkey's again from Amazon again.	-1
After following the instructions very carefully, not one of these little critters "hatched" for us.  (An entire kit can be purchased for 1/3 of the cost of this refill.)  Rather than a replacement as requested, apparently I'm getting a refund.	-1
Nada. We got nothing. The packets were damp. But the exterior package was not.	-1
Monkeys died fright after coming to life:(	-1
These are so disappointing! As a kid I had about 4 full sets at a time with the aquariums and all the toys, and they thrived for years. It's now 35 years later and I figured, hey it was fun then, let's try now- if I could be so successful as a 12 year old, I could at least have one tank work out now, right?  This is my second set in 2 months, and I have a total of ZERO sea monkeys! The first batch I had ONE that made it to be an adult female with an egg sac and everything. (So see, I didn't mess it up totally). Then I started a new colony in another tank because eventually I wanted to give her some playmates, but after a month, I have none. Even the female from the original batch died. This is crazy. Both tanks hatched successfully with lots of little "specks" that are the baby sea monkeys, and I fed them exactly on time, and now I have none at all. None of the sea monkeys from the second batch even made it to adulthood. Their water wasn't yucky, they weren't placed in full sun, they were fed on time, kept at even temperature, all the things they say to do were done.  The major difference I can think of is that nowadays I see the food is more a pale yellow color. "Back in the day" it was a deep green and looked like dried algae. Now it looks really pale, and both food packets from the 2 sets had the same color food, so I assume that's the way they make it now. But the results sure are disappointing. I bought the sets 4 months apart (but set them up a month apart) so I doubt it would be the same batch of food, but who knows.  Maybe I'll try spring water. "Back in the day" I used well water from our PA farm. Now I live near SF in CA and maybe the 24 hours they say to let your water sit with conditioner in it just doesn't work. Maybe I'll try bottled water with the conditioner.  Overall though, I'm bummed, and I would think that I have some major experience with these little guys and I can't get them to work nowadays, so I think the quality has gone down over the decades.  (That being said, I think they were first marketed in 1957. If their viability is crummy today, and 30 years ago they were really good, then in 1957 they must have been AMAZING!)	-1
I followed the directions and not a single one hatched. Very disappointed kids here.	-1
Sticky egg packet they never lived	-1
We have done sea monkeys in the past with no problem.  But this time when we opened the #2 packet with the live eggs in it it was wet inside.  The packet was not wet on the outside, just the inside, so now we can't even use them!	-1
I have owned sea monkeys before and I have never had a problem with them.  They always hatch right away and there are tons of them and they live forever!  I have tried 3 times with these that I ordered off here and only once did I get them to hatch.  Then within a week of them hatching, they died.  My kids are disappointed.	-1
If it were possible I'd give zero stars... I've hatched Seamonkies four times before, never had any issues.  This time I bought this refill set, which I've never done before and will never do again.  This company must be selling bad eggs.  I've waited two weeks since purifying and -24/hrs after -adding eggs and none of them have hatched.  Fourteen days and nothing!  I'm no expert but I know this was not set up wrong.  I used bottled/distilled water from the same source as my other kits, I purified the water, stirred gently, waited 24 hours, added eggs... Nothing.  I would not recommend buying from this company!  Go to your local Walmart or buy a whole kit (which sometimes can be cheaper).  DO NOT waste your money on this Vendor!!!	-1
A single, little, sea monkey... I'm reordering... I'm pretty sure it's us, not you. I'm just glad we tried sea monkeys before good fish, I can see clearly we're probably a year off from safely keeping any pets...	-1
We have raised sea monkey several times, always buying them as we see them in a store.  This time I bought them from this site on Amazon.  Not a single one hatched.  We follow the directions meticulously, and given other reviewer comments, I am certain they are selling batches with bad eggs.  Not worth the return; we will save the food for another time, but boy was my daughter disappointed.  Never again from this site.  I will buy them locally in a store from now on.	-1
They never hatched.	-1
Bought two kits.  4 brine shrimp hatched.  All died within days.  One kit didn't hatch at all.  You CAN NOT order 'free' replacements online.  You have to mail in an order form.  Their idea of "FREE" replacement for two years includes paying THREE DOLLARS for handling PLUS a STAMPED self addressed envelope.  Since I only paid five for the kits at wally world, this is not a free replacement.  And the replacement doesn't include a tank, just egg packet and purifier.  You're better off buying a small plastic container and purchasing the eggs for a few dollars.  A small straw is great to blow 'Oxygen' into the tank daily, or just swirl it around.  Sea Monkeys are fun.  Really.  But this company is a rip-off and not consumer friendly at all.  Good luck trying to call them.  The one and ONLY phone number I could find for them on the internet is disconnected.  They need to have the ability to order online in the US, they need to be more consumer friendly, and it does NOT cost Three dollars anywhere to mail an envelope that already has your own stamp on it.	-1
Well we are patiently waiting - this is second batch since Christmas. Saw something for a short while and then nothing. We shall see.	-1
I went to display my anime figures inside this display case and when I did that the shelves  were falling off and I'm not very happy with it	-1
POOR BUY !  NOT VERY CLEAR AND NOT LOUD AT ALL !	-1
Disappointing.  The kids LOVED this but it soon quit working.  Stopping reading the original bar codes.  The microphone is barely audible.  I would have been pleased had it worked for any decent time period, but it did not.  Pay attention to the bad reviews.	-1
Just received this cash register and the drawer would not open and the scan did not work. Seemed very cheaply made for the money. Returned and will not repurchase.	-1
draw keeps getting stuck..	-1
We bought these for our boys ages 5 & 6.  We read all the reviews prior to purchasing and took a chance.  The drawers DO STICK.  If you push the button VERY HARD the drawer will open.  The scanner does work but you must be very accurate when scanning the card and very patient ~ which my boys are not.  The boys were very excited to receive them however they hardly ever use them because they aren't easy to use.	-1
We bought this for my son so he could learn a trade. But less then a day into using it the microphone broke. No longer can he tell us about the cleanup needed on isle 9. Now the mess just goes unnoticed, until I slip on it and achieve the pose we've all seen on those Caution Wet Floor signs. On the up side the barcode scanner can read my daughter's birthmark and says it's work 4 dollars.	-1
the reviews said this was great but my girl had no fun with it at all.  draw was always stuck, scanner did not work most of the time so we sent it back	-1
Straight out of the box the drawer would not open--when you press the 'Open' button it makes a 'Cha-Ching' noise as described in the instructions but the drawer would not open--appeared to be stuck slightly open but no amount of jiggling, pushing, etc would get the drawer to respond to the button.  The scanner also responded indiscriminately to any of the bar codes--not bringing up the specific price based on the label that was scanned but bringing up one of the prices randomly--not sure this matters but certainly is not how it is supposed to work.  Returned immediately.	-1
Drawer does not open....at.all!! The lever that releases it inside does not lift high enough. I did not try to return it because my kids had already torn into it, excited to play and the rcpt and box were thrown out but what a joke! I saw in the reviews that this has been an ongoing problem with this toy. I bought it thinking the money was causing those drawers to stick but now I see this is just very poorly made. The company should not continue to sell something that clearly doesn't work.  Too bad because I love the idea and all the other features. If it were not for the malfunctioning drawer it would get a 5 star rating.	-1
Didn't last. I wish this had been a little more sturdy. The plastic on one side cracked and now it's going to have to head to the trash because I can't see a good way of attempting to fix it.	-1
It came folded in half and it's face was deformed as a result, I sent it back	-1
NOT Loftus rubber chickens. Do not be fooled.  Different color, head shape, mouth shape, and texture.  I am building a bat'leth from Loftus rubber chickens and needed only two more to finish.  Ordered two of these and they are not even close to being a match.  RIPOFF.  And I now don't have time to get the right kind.	-1
This is NOT a rubber chicken, it is a firm plastic chicken. The item description needs to be changed to state this is flexible plastic, not rubber. Will return for refund.	-1
was much to hard for this old woman	-1
Very pretty puzzle but it smells like incense. I have not taken the cellophane off of it because I plan to give it as a gift at the Christmas holiday. I have it out on the counter hopeing the odor goes away. Not good	-1
I never give such a bad review.  I always give something at least a chance.  I actually had this one in my cart.  I love art for myself as well as appreciating other artists. I love James Christensen's work. I collect his puzzles and calendars. Something kept bothering me about the picture.  I took it out of the cart, back in again, and out again.  It was gorgeous, but something bothered me about the picture.  Then I realized it was flipped wrong from the way he had painted it!.  I read the reviews and that was it.  I'm sorry, but since I do art as well as appreciate it, that would drive me crazy just to see it like that after all that work.  I could deal with the tedious part, and get through the pieces shapes slowly, but I can't handle the picture being the opposite of how he painted it.	-1
I've purchased at least a dozen Sunsout shaped puzzles and this is the first one that I'm not happy with.  The pieces are thick and heavy and have to be pushed together to connect.  The picture is fine but the quality of the material is poor.  Hopefully this is an anomaly and will not be repeated.	-1
It's a great idea but the design is horrible.  My 6yo son received this for his birthday and was very excited to try it out. We pulled it out of the packaging, put the rocket on the rocket stand and it snapped immediately. The rocket didn't fit properly on the base-- the base was too wide and cracked the rocket as soon as we put it on. It broke before we could even try it one time.  I'm not sure how someone could create such a major design flaw in such a simple product, but Toysmith and 4M Industrial Development Limited somehow figured out how.  So instead of this being a fun science lesson, I turned this into a lesson about how some people want you to spend your precious money on cheap crap that fails immediately. We talked about how this was a "waste of money" and a "Rip Off".	-1
We tried this several times, with no success, other than vinegar leaking out the "o" ring.  What a huge disappointment after much anticipation. (son received as a gift at his birthday party)  Would NOT spend a dollar on this. Would give ZERO stars if I could.	-1
Like everything else Strawberry Shortcake. Listed as scented and NO SMELL. My Strawberry Shortcake Dolls from 25 years ago have a stronger smell now than the new ones today. I can't get the Strawberry to attach outside; Not enough room for it to attach. Don't care for the sticker furniture. How about REAL furniture. My biggest complaint is you can't find the accesories. My daughter seems to enjoy it, now strawberry "lives" next door to barbie. I guess that is all that matters. Save your money and wait for a larger version. Maybe they'll come out with a two story like 25 years ago:)	-1
We are a board game family and horse-lovers, so this game should be perfect for us, but this game is HORRIBLE.  If you enjoy Monopoly, stick to the original.  What really ruins this game are the incredibly stupid "Horseplay" cards (equivalent to the "Chance" and "Community Chest" cards in the original game).  They say things like, "Do your best trot around the room or pay $50."  Sorry, but that is just plain dumb unless you are 4 yrs old.  Or trivia questions like, "Which two horse breeds on the board are named after their color?  If you answer wrong, pay each player $50."  Well, it doesn't take long to simply memorize the answers if you play the game more than once, so those trivia cards become boring.  Someone who knows nothing about horses and was asleep on the job wrote up those cards.  We've played this game three times and it is now in the Goodwill pile.  Don't waste your money.	-1
My son LOVES dinosaurs but prefers regular monopoly over this game. It's kind of confusing and gets boring fast. Quality board and pieces though	-1
If you've ever seen the film "Name of the Rose", then you'll have a good idea of the theme of this game.  I've always loved the movie with Christian Slater and Sean Connery and it's moody historical story that made you feel like you were in medieval Europe. Unlike the movie, this game fails in so many ways. But before I get ahead of myself, let me give you reasons why;  Components: The figurines looked like mini monk statues and really nice sculptures. The board was a overhead illustration of a medieval building with rooms and thematic Latin words. However every now and then, we would draw from a deck of room cards that were black and white (and I thought to myself, "why are they not in color? Seems like a dumb way to save money"). The box was nice and sturdy and the rules did not seem very complete, and we were house ruling in some things to make it complete.  Art/Design: The art is almost comic book looking and seems odd. I have never understood why Clue was so "cute-sy" and comic-like if the subject was murder (and the same applies here). Maybe the producer and designer wanted to "keep-it-light" and keep it from being too grim? Because murder and a criminal monk isn't a laughing matter. The colors are somewhat muted and the box top's art does not match the inside's almost water color style as well.  Game play/Game Mechanics: Every player on his/her turn gets two/three action points. Most people would move two spaces and then ask questions of another investigator/player. Being in any room for the most part, gained no real advantage. At one point all the players stayed in the center room and just asked questions of each other. I took notes in the game we played, but it just seemed to confuse me because at the end of the 4th round, we went to "mass" and passed the 4 monk cards to the right. This practically killed my notes. What is odd about this game is, I at no time felt "immersed" within the theme. Also, at no time did we the investigators learn who was killed or what crime was committed. Furthermore, we at no time learned motives or other crime investigatory techniques or ways to narrow the search. All we could do is ask weather the guilty monk had a beard, hood or was skinny, etc etc. This series of elimination was downright annoying, and we just started guessing to get the game over with. Basically when you hurry to end a game (just to get it over with) this is a sign of a bad game in my opinion. The room cards that gave you special functions or special powers, gained you practically nothing as well.  End Thoughts: I know your going to think I am negative and a "hater", but this game really lacks in so many ways. I wanted to love this game since "The Name of the Rose" is such an awesome theme and movie. I believe if this game's mechanics and art was altered significantly you'd have an great game. Not learning of who the victim was is like having no body to a murder. In real life, the investigators would have "nothing" and the case would get dropped. Thus I intend to drop this game from my collection for I too had no "body of evidence".	-1
i was very pleased with the fast service and response to this product.  was packed very well and in excellent condition when i received it.  i would order any time from amazon and recommend them to all my friends and family.  thanks again for being so prompt and friendly.	-1
Terrible game.  What do you do when you cant find the item? And what a mess it makes....the kids didn't even care for it-it got only played once before it got shelved and never touched again.	-1
Seriously disappointed!! From the picture on the box it looks like it's a good size but it's not! Super small! The slide sucks and the water does not spray very well.	-1
This seemed like an awesome idea. My two boys, 1 1/2 and 3, played with it for only 15 minutes or so and that was it. They make it look like there's so much to do, but really it's just spraying water on a bunch of colored plastic.  I swear they use the tiniest children they can find for the photos for these things. Don't be fooled. This splash pool is small. The slide was way too small to be used. Even my 1 1/2 year old was bored with that after a couple goes. If I was holding him at the top, like the mom holding her daughter in this picture, his feet would nearly touch the end of the slide. And no, he's not particularly tall. My 3 year old is very tall and he had no fun with this thing whatsoever.  My kids received it as a gift from grandma. Thankfully she said she spent only twenty on it, not the eighty they're selling it for here. At best my boys were simply too old for it (grandma has a habit of buying for "babies"). But regardless, I was unimpressed. Not worth the purchase or the 1000s of gallons of water it'll use up. It was hard to justify all the wasted water when the 3 year old would rather throw the whale slide into the real pool and the 1 1/2 year old was content in sitting in a nearby puddle on the concrete.	-1
so loud and stiff i never took it out after that one tome is being used a a toy storage	-1
The experiments using the yeast provided did not work.  I went and bought some yeast and then they worked.  So the yeast was old and outdated.  I didn't know yeast could get old until my mom mentioned that it could and that's probably why it didn't work.  There were no dates on the packages of yeast that I could find.	-1
The bear I recieved was dark brown, not as cute as this one pictured.	-1
Product is NOT the color advertised.	-1
Stella hated this bear and screamed at it! Will try it again when she is a little older,and if not then it will just be a toy.	-1
I bought this for my 5 week old twin boys hoping it would help them sleep but it didn't help either one.	-1
My boys loved it while it lasted, but about a week in,it got a hole that wasn't able to be patched	-1
Lasted 10 days before the inner barrier for sand busted. Now it won't come back up when punched. My 5 and 2 year old loved it while it lasted, but I wish it had been sturdier.	-1
popped in less than a month	-1
Once knocked down, he fails to come back up 19 out of 20 times.  The 4 year old still likes to rough him up, but product does not function correctly.	-1
Deflated within hours of opening the toy	-1
Very short, cheap valve hard to blow up, adding Water to the bottom is impossible without a hose outdoors and it doesn't stand straight up. I should have known for $16 and Made in China. Got it for a four year old and it totally was not fun.	-1
Came with leak	-1
Leaked air from the moment we got it.  My son love "Practicing his power Rangers moves" on it but I have to blow it back up before and after every  few minutes.  Amazon is sending a new one, we will see if it holds air any better	-1
It does not bounce back some times after punching it.	-1
Product held air for a few minutes, side seams not properly sealed and leaked. Waste of money,too bad grand kids would have had fun if it was as advertised. Had one as a child and it held up fine.	-1
This thing is a waste of money. My 3 year old hits it and it doesn't pop back up. If it doesn't work for him I don't think it would work for a 2 year old either.	-1
popped first day	-1
Did not last very long.	-1
Lame, I loved my pob bag as a kid. This one does not bounce back and really needs more weight in the bottom. Little kids like playing with it, I don't tell them that it is supposed to bounce back.	-1
Had a hole the first day. Went in the garbage. Not worth the return hassle. Bought a different one for Xmas and its still going strong	-1
Thought this would be cute for my kids...but it started leaking air right away. We pump it up but then a few hours later it's falling over. Kids really like it, but it doesn't seem that durable!	-1
As many others have stated, the seams leak.  We blew it up Christmas Eve and by Christmas morning it was flopped over -- about half full to three-quarters full.  Unusable.  If you buy this, get some kind of pump.  We have one, and just kept blowing it up every day.  But it really wasn't worth it.  Kids lose interest after about 5 minutes of this.  I love the retro aspect of it.  I had one as a kid.  If the quality was better and didn't require daily pumping, I'd be happy with it.  As it is, though, it's a complete waste of money and a real pain.	-1
The sand in the bottom of this bopper doesn't flow back to it's original place which makes the bopper not to stand straight up.  If you punch it hard, it just stays down.	-1
we had this toy for our children years ago and it seemed more resilient to punches.  we remember bozo being a very active part of playtime.  this bozo goes down and stays down pretty easily.  his nose beeps but only when mashed on when he is down.  our grandson is 17 months old and gives bozo a salutory punch and then a hug when he comes to our house but ignores him the rest of the time.  possibly our grandson is just too young or lacks pugilistic fervor.	-1
My child did not really like it and it broke within a couple months. My child really did not like tummy time though, so it may not have totally been the fault of the toy.	-1
This item leaked almost immediately, but I didn't open the package until after the return time window was up. Piece of junk!	-1
"Shows his age" is a good way to describe DScytheHellEW.  Very light for HG, wings are gimiky, and most of my complaints could be fixed with a bit more engineering with polycaps, but this is a build from 1998, and is normal for this vintage.  Kinda like complaining that a 57 Chevy has a creeking noise when closing the doors.  If you are a fan of DScythe, you will love it no matter what.  If you do a lot of builds, especially with more modern kits, then you will be dissapointed.	-1
The tin says directions are included; they were not. I don't have the faintest idea how to play!!!!!	-1
I do not like this game, and my daughter doesn't either. There are way too many similar pictures in the set of cards. We only play with half of them anyway, but they are still very similar. Also there is nothing on the back of the tiles to help you lay them out all the same way. Some of them are always upside down or sideways. We like Dr. Seuss matching MUCH better. The pictures are all different, there is a logo on the back of each tile so that you can lay them out properly, and it's overall more fun. My daughter picks Dr. Seuss matching over the Disney game every time.	-1
This was not very entertaining for my two year old son.  He LOVES farm animals, baby chickens, etc. and this was a little bit of a disappointment for him.  The chicks do let out a bit of a squeak when you press on their heads, but nothing significant.  All of the shells fit on all of the eggs/chicks so, again, nothing significant.	-1
Cheap! Save your money. And its very tedious to have to put this back together	-1
Wish I could give it zero stars. A cheap toy, worth maybe a couple bucks. What a rip off.	-1
It was dirty and used. NOT even the Tomy brand that it was advertised as.	-1
Did not squeak very much. But baby liked playing with them.	-1
Cute, but the "squeak" is merely a screw rubbing on the plastic when you push the egg down. If it isn't held just right or the screw is a little tight or loose, no "squeak." Only two of mine made anything remotely resembling a squeak sound.	-1
I feel this is just kind of a "meh" toy.  We'll see how my daughter likes it when her birthday comes around.  I purchased in May 2017 and I did receive the "TOMY" brand.  I was disappointed that the chicks don't come fully out of the eggs.  Guess I should have looked closer at the description.	-1
I would really love to give this seller/product a good review, but unfortunately I cannot. I actually have the Tomy set of eggs and wanted another for my other child. I was incredibly disappointed to recieve a knock off version (kangaroo brand?)... and the worst part - the product was filthy. This looked like a used toy...or something that had been sitting in a dusty warehouse for years. The white eggs were actually yellow. Very disappointing...and a bit disgusting. The eggs which were supposed to squeak, did not, and the graphics scrape off easily with a fingernail. Add to all of this- shipping was lengthy.	-1
I did not receive the same product as advertised. It was Kangaroo brand, cheaply made and dirty, they don't squeak, and one of the eggs' shell didn't match the inside. I'm returning this item.	-1
One of the eggs came missing a top shell. Product just "eh". The squeak isn't really pleasant or chick-like. 13 month old doesn't enjoy them much. She likes to put the shells on/off but gets bored fast and goes and does the same with the pots and pans instead.	-1
These had a lot of good reviews. But... they're not that great. Baby just bangs them and makes their shells come off and it is over it. The squeakers are terrible. There's no way a baby can make them squeak consistently. I have to press down on them hard myself for any noise. Would be better as shakers.	-1
These barely make a sound. Without the sound its a boring toy for a toddler or baby.	-1
silly toy..	-1
It's not what I expected but the kids use it in their kitchen.	-1
The squeak sound it very soft and almost hard to make the eggs do it. Not what I expected and will be returning.	-1
cheap was not happy with product	-1
CHALK ON A BLACKBOARD, SQUEAKING WILL DRIVE YOU MAD, DON'T BUY.	-1
I don't get the hype with this toy!!! Maybe mine is broken, but the squicky sounds are weird. Mellisa and Doug has eggs much better than this. Maybe my 11 months old doesnt get it, and maybe my husband and I don't also. And my mom and dad. And my sister and her 3 year old. Maybe. Or maybe there were sent at a "discounted" price to all those who posted 5*...	-1
This toy was too difficult for children who are between age 2 and 3 years old. It was difficult to do and as a result need hand over hand guidance from an adult and didn't their didn't hold their attention.	-1
Disappointed not an interesting toy	-1
My daughter (15 months) could have cared less about these. They were just thrown all over the place. Not necessarily the manufacturers fault, but I thought she would have enjoyed them more. They, unfortunately, went to goodwill.	-1
My son didn't play with this toy before or after he turned 1. He is 17m now and still not playing with it so i am not sure what age category this toy is. May be for when they turn 2yr - 3yr old.	-1
I thought this would make a cute Easter gift, but this toy doesn't interest my son (23-months old) very much.  Also, maybe I got a defective toy, but the ones that I have do not squeak.  They do look cute.	-1
This went back immediately. It doesn't squeak. Metal rubbing against metal isn't "squeaking" to me. Ugh. Super disappointed.	-1
My kids had no interest in this.  The squeaker in the eggs did not work.  I just find myself cleaning these up all day and no one actually playing with them.  I found it to be a pointless toy, but others might enjoy.	-1
This was a gift for a two year old who liked playing with the eggs. It's part fun, part learning experience. The eggs fit in the storage crate by aligning the various shapes in the bottom of the eggs to the crate. Squeezing down on the egg produces a little "peep".  This would be a 5-star toy but the quality of the two plastic hinges on the crate suffer badly. They are too thin and cracked after a few days of light play. I patched them using tape for a short term fix.	-1
Eh. They're OK. We've lost a lot of the pieces already, though, and I'm not sure how easily my 2-year-old son can match the bottoms of the eggs with the carton spaces. I haven't really seen him play with it. No color coordination to help. Squeaking is cute. Faces are cheery. Quality seems to be decent.	-1
Not a very interesting toy. The eggs don't really squeak, they hardly make a noise, had to return them.	-1
small and cheap looking for the price	-1
These are ok, I bought them for my daughter and quickly realized the "Squeak" is just the plastic rubbing on other plastic. Seems they could make these better somehow. I wouldn't buy again, but I won't take away from my daughter.	-1
These are very cute and my 1 year old enjoys squeezing them to hear them squeak. The sound is not very loud, but she doesn't mind and we certainly don't either. The issue I have with them though is the tops. This egg shells have jagged edges and my daughter fell on one. She ended up cutting herself and weeks later she is scarred. My advice is to take the tops and put them up away out of your child's reach. They are dangerous!	-1
Very Small, Very Small.  Just wasn't happy with the purchase.  Sometimes you win with online purchases sometimes you don't.  Not all of the eggs squeaked, disappointed.	-1
My son tried to open the case and the latch got stuck on his skin and cut him. I threw the case away and he just plays with the eggs.	-1
I'm a little unhappy with this purchase. I will say right away, I'm an early childhood educator, and am usually spot on when buying a toy for a little one.  I was purchasing this birthday gift for a soon to be one year old.  The description from Amazon recommends this toy for a child 12 months and up.  I took this out of the shipping box, and written very clearly on the Tomy box it says for children 6 months and up. While I'm sure this toy would grow with a child, Amazon gave inaccurate information. I guess I will be going to Fat Brain Toys for an alternative gift, appropriate for a one year old. I'm not sure I will bother sending this back. So cute and fun toy for a 6 month old. Not so much for a "big boy" of one.	-1
Horrible quality. The eyes stopped lighting up within minutes of opening this item. It will only walk on a low carpeted floor. It doesn't move on a smooth tile surface or thicker carpeting. Don't waste your money.	-1
The description makes you think that this robot is capable of all sorts of amazing things.  The reality is that it barely goes in one direction before the batteries wear out.  My son played with it once and then the dog ate it.  A fitting end.	-1
I got these for my daughter as part of her first Easter basket because I thought they were adorable.  She played with them under normal circumstances and the "hinge" broke off by that evening.  I couldn't believe that the container was already broken because the reviews for this were pretty positive.  Not only did it no longer contain the eggs, but the broken plastic left behind was sharp.  I was not impressed.	-1
Not the best choice I made to buy for my 15 month old. he is not interested in it at all, I put it away I will bring it out again in a few months.	-1
Not what I thought.	-1
I expected higher play value with Tomy so this does not meet my expectations. The squeaky sound it makes is only natural when you push the shell to fit. It is quite a boring toy and a chore just de shelling n fixing it back.	-1
I got this as a gift for a toddler and did not give it.  It is a very cheap, cheesy, what would you call it - a game?  Save your money.	-1
Purchased this for a Christmas gift for my grandson. It is cute and catches the attention and play time, however, within minutes the hinge plastic broke. It is poor quality plastic. If you want a toy that will last, don't buy this....very disappointed. All my 2 year old grandson did was to open it and it broke!	-1
My 2 year old grandson has never played with it.  It isn't easy for them to open the carton and the eggs just aren't much for them to be interested in.	-1
The hinge on the egg carton ripped apart trying to get it out of the packaging. Love the product but it should be built better.  The exposed hinge is now a sharp edge that may cut my child's fingers.  Returning it.  Design the hinge safely.  Disappointed but I love the squeaks!	-1
The squeaking noises aren't very loud.  There are too many pieces.  Maybe it would be fun for an older child, but my 10-month-old had absolutely zero interest in this.	-1
I purchased this for my grankids.  I was disappointed with the product itself.  However, the kids seem to enjoy it.	-1
In my household with 3 young children,and 2 of them young enough to "appreciate" this toy...all it is used for is to scatter about and add to the mess.  I have never seen my children use this toy in the way it's intended, as something of a shape sorter.  It is very complicated for a child to use it this was as the shape at the bottom of the egg is inconspicuous and where it should be placed takes some amount of examination not likely to be done by a small child.  When they have tried to put the eggs back into the egg carton, they generally just see them as not fitting right, so the result is the eggs are never in their container and generally a favorite toy to scatter about the floor.  I also found that the container, when closed, is really hard to open and I have had to pry it open for them every time it's been closed. What a disappointment for a highly rated toy.	-1
i got this for my 15 month old for easter and was excited to receive this toy, but it baffled me when i opened it up and immediately discovered while the tops of the egg come off, the little chicks inside don't actually come out. boo. then while opening the rest of the egg tops, i see that there are duplicate colors-- wait... actually only 3 colors all together?! seriously? 2 purple, 2 blue, and 2 orange. how lame is that?! why in the world would they do that? that was very upsetting and boring to me and definitely doesn't take advantage of that learning opportunity. finally, i realized that while the tops of the eggs are interchangeable with each other, the bottoms of the eggs are not, due to the shapes (circle, square, heart). and while this is an educational plus, it's a play time negative since this toy's value is only good for young kids, by the time they reach the age to know/figure out shapes, they've surpassed the toy's lifespan for their time in terms of fun and entertainment. at least IMO. oh, and the lid is very difficult to open and definitely cannot be opened by a child, which i was bothered by. overall, i still think it's a decent toy, but DEFINITELY not worth the $30 i paid!!!! (EDIT: currently it's listed for $8?!?!?! ...ridiculous. here's a tip: don't buy close to easter!! get it well in advance and save it!)! i'd be satisfied only if it had been $10. but anything over $15 for this is absolutely not worth it (not sure what i was thinking for the price i paid)	-1
I bought this for my 11mo old daughter. The "squeak" from the eggs is not what I imagined. There is no real squeaker, just a rushing of air if you forcefully push on the head inside the egg (if you don't press fast enough you end up with basically just a clicking sound). Also, the box is a little hard to open, and my daughter gets very frustrated when she tries (even I find it a little awkward to open, it's not just the baby). Overall I say this toy is "ok" at best.	-1
My daughter does not play with this toy at all. She is 16 months old. Perhaps it will be more fun when she is older. For now, this purchase was a bust.	-1
The picture shows colorful egg faces and 6 different colored chicks. I received eggs with dull brown faces and 3 dull colored chicks. And they don't really make much of a squeaking noise. Will be returning it.	-1
This toy is really, really boring.  The eggs make a very faint chirping sound (no fun) and the colors are not as vibrant as pictured.  I will keep this because Easter is near and the toy is usable, but it really isn't something my grandson will be interested in for more than a minute.	-1
My daughter is 17 months and LOVES to play with this toy. I am always tripping over, finding, losing, or searching for the effing egg pieces. I'm glad she likes it and it offers great fine motor and hand-eye practice. But the toy itself annoys the crap out of me... even more than another of her toys that randomly starts playing music in the middle of the night when no one has touched it.	-1
This is a great fun game if you are lucky enough to buy one that works and that does not break after five seconds. I bought one that stopped working after three days. A year later I bought another, it did not work right out of the box (lights failed). I exchanged it and the replacement was not 100% either (lights failed and one handle was poor). I am now returning it for my money back.	-1
I purchased as a gift for my 2 13 year old nephews and we played it right after they opened it and one of the holders didn't work at all. Seriously disappointed, I offered to send it back for them but they said it was okay. I feel bad that I have them a gift that was defective from the get go. I wouldnt recommend.	-1
This was a Christmas gift that became this years Christmas dud.  Tried 2 different sets of batteries and it never powered up.  We were really excited about this one with all the great reviews.	-1
It was a ton of fun but is so cheaply put together it broke the first day we used it. Only one handle still works. Very disappointed.	-1
First step: tried unscrewing the battery door. The thread stripped after 30 seconds, now there's no way to get it open. Too late to return it on Amazon, so into the trash it goes. Don't make the same mistake!	-1
Too intense. Not fun. This isn't for ANYONE. If they decreased the voltage from electrocution strength (even "low") so there was only a faint buzz/tingle  given to loser it could be tons of fun for a family. As it currently is the ONLY group of people that may have fun with it is a group of frat guys - and I think they would still need to be seriously wasted to want to do it more than 1 time.	-1
Cheaper the picture makes it look. Thin metal handles look cheap and has a massive space in between. The game is quite fun, though you have to really focus on not breaking the cheap handles. I expected for the price, the quality to be a lot better.	-1
Bought this as a gift for a teenager.  Not a hit.  3 out of 3 disliked it.	-1
works as advertised but it feels like electricution, even adults refuse to play it second time!	-1
My son refused to play.  But the adults had fun... once.  Haven't met anyone that would play more than one day though.  Gave it away to someone that thought they could get more use out of it.	-1
A fun idea, but it isn't weighted enough to bounce back up after "punching it."	-1
Already in poor condition when I got it. Still "new in package", but package was bent and it was obvious it was older Necklace was already faded and turning that nasty color all cheap jewelry material eventually turns. The stones were not properly in place, all crooked and hardly in the correct settings. Very disappointing and very cheaply made.	-1
Horrible, impossible to blow up. return	-1
Ugg so disappointed.  It truly is a Bozo!  First off, it won't even fully inflate.  Secondly when I would get enough air in it to stand, it does not come back up if you punch it.  So lame and a waste of money!  Don't buy!	-1
It doesn't really pop back up after it's bopped, which greatly reduces the fun of having it on my desk.	-1
I purchased for my desk at work but Item did not stay fully inflated.  I've had one in the past, so I am a bit surprised.  Bummer!	-1
This firefighter play set is misleading. No piece actually functions.  The megaphone does not amplify a voice, the phone doesn't make any sounds, and the poor construction of the flashlight makes it difficult to operate.  The whistle does work, but is made of a cheap plastic.  The only item in the set that my son did like was the oxygen mask, but it does not fit well at all and smashes against his face.  I will be returning this item.	-1
Didn't really work as described. Was a dud.	-1
When these came in I was very excited for some office pranks. However close to half of these loads were duds. As in they didn't stink when you lit them.  Making my pranks really lame.	-1
this is an item that we did not like at all. it was not at all what we really thought it would be or what we would have gotten. we did not like this item at all	-1
This item was ordered two weeks before Christmas. I checked the rush order and I paid extra for it to get here on time. It didn't.	-1
THE FRONT FLAP IS VERY TIGHT, I THOUGHT IT WAS GLUED. BUT AFTER A LITTLE WORK YOU CAN OPEN IT TO SHOW THE DECK INSIDE. BUT IT'S NOT A DECK, THE WHOLE BOTTOM IS EXPOSED SO YOU NEED TO BE VERY CAREFULL. THE CARD CASE PART IS VERY TIGHT. I ALSO HAVE SHIN LI  GONE DECK, IT'S A SOLOD METAL GIMICK AND CAN BE USED FRO MANY TRICKS. GET IT AT PENGUIN MAGIC IT'S 29.95 BUT WORTH IT. YOU ONLY HAVE TO KEEP ONE SIDE HIDDEN, IT HAS A SIDE OPEN TO PUT CARDS IN.	-1
The box is cardboard.  We didn't realize this.  My son was so disappointed.  Maybe we should have read it more clearly.	-1
Stupid trick gave it away not worth the money	-1
cheap	-1
Bought it for a costume party, it is very nice, looks real but the fake smoke lasts only 2 or 3 puffs. It is covered in a powder and once you blow it twice it's over. The description of the product is a bit misleading.	-1
Terrible.  did not "puff smoke" at all  Wouldnt buy again.	-1
NOT GOOD	-1
looked real, no smoke puff, cheap material	-1
had to use the entire bottle on one small glass of wine. And it took forever to gel up and looked awful. It was so obvious we had done something to the drink!	-1
didn't work.. oh was just a joke.. but still, didn't work as stated.	-1
worthless	-1
Did work, they were returned	-1
Just ok...but not worth what I paid for them	-1
One side of the cuffs faulty can't be lock. No points for doing "magic cuffs" before sending to me the package already opening up.	-1
It's REALLY confusing to have a double sided puzzle! Gosh, my head hurts from figuring out where all the pieces go. It is way to complicates for my 2 year and 8month daughter	-1
Basically use to prank a kid.  Not quality looking in person to fool anyone else.  Most on here are buying for children I'm sure.	-1
This is not your off the shelf model kit, ive been building model kits for awhile and you have to be really an expert to build this. the frames are pretty easy but thats it from there !!	-1
This engine is very small!!!! Not what i thought I was buying, way to hard for younger children because parts are so small...your child will need adult help for sure.	-1
Came with batteries that lasted 30-seconds. The battery door is poorly designed and does not fit the base very well.  With new batteries, the santa works, but he is very hard to understand.  My kid squeezed the finger a few times, then threw it out. Only says four sayings and I don't understand one of them.	-1
Audio quality very poor, your money would be better spent on something else	-1
sent back not very good	-1
Work for about 1 minute and quit. Took it apart to find the problem which was a broken wire. All wires were flimsy and easy to break. Work for anothey few minutes and stopped. I promptly put it in the trash!	-1
Too small, I ordered the full size, got a useless ball that was no good to me at all.	-1
The gertie ball seems to have always had a hole and will always be kind of flat. The plug is unnecessarily long, so it's pokey through the other side if the ball is not properly inflated and could cause injury to a small child if it happened to get wedged just right.	-1
Everything sticks to it making the ball dirty and linty	-1
This ball received great reviews, so I ordered it for my kids.  I feel like it's unsafe.  There is a plunger/plug that you insert into the ball to inflate it.  I feel like it can be pulled out way too easily and did not feel safe letting my children play with it.	-1
This ball leaks from the plug. We reinflate it, but then it starts to deflate immediately. It's not worth the effort.	-1
Tore within 5 minutes.	-1
Plug won't push in all the way. Difficult to blow up all the way and put plug in. I'm returning it.	-1
The ball is soft and easy to blow up.  It's easily graspable and tossable and won't hurt the kid if he gets hit in the face with it.  But, don't let him watch you blow it up because then he'll know to look for the plastic insert that's used to keep the ball inflated.  And then, he pulls that out of course and the ball because flat.  Not too swift, but we did use the flattened ball as a hat and a great peek-a-boo cover.	-1
"Let us pick your color for you"... Well, I guess I deserve that much. One thing about the ball, because of it's easy to grab nature, it also attracts dirt. Since my 8-month-old BOY likes to put every thing in his mouth, it's something additional to worry about.	-1
My 3.5 year old loves space / solar + science. First thing he said is, "How does it fly?" He plays with it on rare occasion. It's just OK quality and its best feature is that it spins really fast in a circle. Not many choices for kids who are into space :-(	-1
The toy is well made however it will not go straight only in circles and my 4 year old son quickly loses interest. I am sorry I bought it.	-1
It was hard to find & open the battery compartment. Then, after a few days, the compartment had to be taped shut. Disappointing.	-1
I've updated my review after putting together more of the buildings. I couldn't believe the 5 star ratings when I got this, now I REALLY don't understand them. Did these people put these kits together? Have they put kits from other manufacturers together?  The value here is debatable. There are lots of details with enough buildings to fill in a nice little downtown on a small layout. If you're used to this kind of building and know what you're in for, then this may be for you. Everyone else should be aware that there were a ton of corners cut in these kits to make it seem like they were a good value. The problem is there's so much work for you to do that it diminishes that value.  There is one thing alone that caused me to lower my initial rating: YOU need to cut walls to fit if you expect to have a building with 4 square corners. Every building I've put together has had a wall too long by 1/8" or more. I am sure it's not me. Their lousy system for "wrapping" the brick work makes it obvious how you're supposed to put the buildings together. How do you have a wall 1/8" over when it's supposed to only be 1" wide to begin with?  Other problems: YOU are expected to sand corners to square, not because of flash from molds and to be precise but because these are made from a single face mold and it's easier for them to get the walls out by leaving an angle on the corners.  YOU need to figure out how to compensate for the fact the brick work doesn't really wrap around the corners.  YOU need to cut roofs from plain squares of styrene and figure out how to dress them up to make them look like real flat roofs.  YOU need to cut "chimneys" from simple styrene tube they supply and again figure out how to dress them up to look like real chimneys.  The price per building of this kit just doesn't add up. With all of the things YOU need to do, you may as well just buy raw materials and build them yourself to your plan. Then you can buy windows separately and paint them separately rather than having it take far longer to paint because you have to paint them in place on the walls.  Woodland Scenics appears to have just dumped this on the market so they can say "here's all you need except the track to build the scenic ridge plan".  Short of it, I've put together many, many models in my life. There are much better models out there to spend money and time on. Walthers, Atlas, Kato, Greenmax all seem to understand the idea that buildings shouldn't just be 4 slabs and that couple of extra details don't make up for bad fundamentals.	-1
In the description, it says that this water tower is 0 scale. I purchased it. Assembly was easy and I started my layout. As I purchased more 0 Scale buildings and started laying down my track, I set the water tower by the track and ran the locomotive by it. One thing is for sure.....this is NOT 0 Scale!!! LOL! Way too small. I would say that it is HO scale. It is not Amazon's fault....it is Bachmann's fault for selling a product that is not correct scale. Luckily for me, a friend is working on an HO layout and it looks good on it. I recently purchased a Lionel water tower and that is the REAL DEAL!!!!	-1
I am updating my original review to say that two months after purchase the float popped. Maybe too many kids had piled on I don't know. Or it could have been inflated too much. Whatever the reason it didn't last. Only kids played on it and they were all pretty small. Wouldn't recommend this float and I definitely wouldn't want a lot of adults on it.  This float is great. The kids love it. They sit on there like it is an island and the adults pretend they are sharks and grab their feet through the eye-holes. It fits 4-5 young kids very comfortably and 3-4 teenagers. It would also be a great lounging float if one of the parents could ship the kids out for the day! Great buy and great price.	-1
Leak	-1
We only used this a few times until it developed a slow leak in one of the seams.  Not very sturdy and didn't hold up well.  Would not purchase again.	-1
A friend of mine and I used one of these for a few years and it is not the most durable launch pad on the market today.  The rod holder assembly is very weak. If you plan on flying some of the lighter weight Estes rockets such as the Eliminator and Executioner, it'll most likely work fine but if you want to fly Estes kits with the more powerful APCP (composite) rocket motors or larger mid power rockets like the Aerotech kits off this pad, forget about it!!!  I personally would recommend the Aerotech Mantis pad over this one. Yes, the Mantis is considerably more expensive, the quality is much better and it will allow you to fly larger rockets off it.  By the way, I finished off this Estes E pad by flying a saucer on an Aerotech G339N Warp-9 motor from the pad, sheared the legs right off. Good riddance.	-1
Yet another generic mech	-1
Very easy to fit to Bachmann track, but they are not realistic in that the single bumper should be a double, and they should also be spring loaded.	-1
Material is not very parachute like. It's like shaking a rain tarp.	-1
100% polyester and feels like plastic. Disappointed it's not like the ones at school, I guess they're nylon? Returning it.	-1
Don't buy this.  Use your own tissue paper	-1
I bought this a part of a beginner "ready to fly" set.  If I continue with this hobby I will look for a cheaper alternative.  This produce is way, way overpriced.	-1
This is kind of a rip off to buy as you are better off making your own. All you need is some old thin cloth as a stuffer.	-1
Buyer beware!  What you're getting isn't what's pictured or described - it's a 0.63 oz tube of plastic cement.  If you wanted the product pictured or the full 1 oz then you're out of luck.	-1
Worked one time and quit. Having a heard time figuring out how to get it fixed. Extremely disappointed in quality as I'm seeing that Lionel has their trains and accessories manufactured in China. So tired of poor quality items from China.	-1
We received this as part of the Polar Express Lionel O Gauge Passenger train set. My dad bought it for my son three years ago Christmas so this is the third time we've set it up and it's had very gentle and not much use. It has never been dropped and it is kept in a dry, room temperature environment year round stored in the box when not in use. Well, the transformer was plugged in but the train was not running (throttle off) when suddenly the train just started moving full throttle. I checked for ghosts, found none and moved the throttle a bit and the train stopped. For five minutes. Then it started all on its own again. This time it wouldn't stop unless I unplugged the transformer.  So I packed up the CW-80 transformer and drove down to Berkeley Ace Hardware which is my local authorized Lionel dealer. They reported to me that several customers have been coming in with these and they're trying to help me out (really good folks there at Berkeley Ace) but I had to order a replacement in the interest of having the train running when we want it running.  These transformers are made in China and unlike your dad's Lionel transformers that still work 75 years later, these are clearly not built to last.	-1
This plane is designed so poorly that the wings fall out whenever you try to throw it.  They don't fit tightly enough into the fuselage.	-1
My toddler is very interested in the world, since we have friends from other countries who have visited, and her aunt lives in Australia.  She's going to be receiving this as a gift, and I honestly can't wait for her to enjoy it.  It looks just as cool in person as in the photos.  Update: We inflated the ball 4 or 5 times just since December (it's April,) and it continues to deflate almost daily.  It is clearly poorly made and leaking air.  I am so disappointed!  What a waste of money and effort!	-1
A bit disappointed. Didn't inflate well (I didn't have a pump). The quality of the images were mediocre. The quality of the information on the globe was also mediocre. Would not recommend.	-1
Horrible graphics. Countries spelled wrong, whole continents cut in half. Ok as a ball, not as a learning globe.	-1
The inflatable globe that I received was poorly printed and did not appear at all like the picture shown. The colors were strange and didn't align to the country borders. Some countries are the same color as the water and some bodies of water aren't blue. I actually got this particular globe because I thought it did not have labels (based on the picture) and I wanted to play a Geography game with my kids; however, it did have labels that were not properly aligned and often were not readable. There's no reason to buy this product as manufactured and sold by this vendor.	-1
This servo is REALLY weak. I kept having Towerpro MG995's die on me, so I thought I'd try a different model, but at least the cheap 995's are strong while they last.	-1
I'm giving this 1-star only because I bought this item solely because of a misleading product description. It states at the end of the product description "When the train approaches, both gates automatically lower" This is of course impossible, as there is no mechanics and nothing to plug in. I should have realized from the price and the photo but nevertheless you need to take that out of the description. For what it is it's fine just not what I was looking for.	-1
Does not do what its says. It says when train comes near gates go up.	-1
Giving one star because description failed to mention this is not for quadcopters requiring clock-wise and counter clock-wise propellers, both. I bought whole bunch of these and later found seller does not sell counter-clock wise version of the same (as confirmed in QA section).	-1
junk, black piece broke off	-1
I used these on my Bandit to Son Uva Digger conversion.  With large brushless power and bigger tires they begin to twist and this causes the suspension to bind.  Mine actually broke after about a month.  So then I bought 2 Traxxas # 6852X Heavy Duty Axles and these hold up much better.  I recommend buying 2 Traxxas #6852X axles and using them, otherwise buy a whole bunch of these, you'll need them!	-1
I was very disappointed in this glue. It seemed to dry slow, and once it dried it didn't hold very well. I was using it on a balsa model. I started with small amounts of glue and then worked up to larger amounts as I realized it wasn't holding well. I switched to well bond later, which seemed to work better.	-1
I got this hoping to better support the high power of LiPo batteries in a Stampede VXL 4x4. But metal edges are sharp and stripped out my expensive wheels. I wouldn't recommend these metal hubs with plastic wheels.	-1
Got to put on an old TRX Pro. It fits, but the connector at the glow plug end is much shorter and therefore it disappears into the cooling head bore before its on the plug. Trying to push it on with the wire is kind of like, well... pushing a rope. I'll probably clean and polish and shrink tube the old one and put it back on.	-1
Purchased this so "santa" could preassemble some legos and have them hold up to being played with. It did not hold and santa was sure to use enough glue and follow directions to the T because nobody like broken toys a few days after christmas. Well with this glue santa failed this year.....	-1
Bonding is not strong and very slow to cure but I can stand it for non-toxic cement. However, filling 3/4 of the tube with air is hands down a scam! The tube was not sealed, so not sure if it was the manufacturer (Testor) or the sellor (BIGFLY). I suspect Testor as the big air deposit was in the middle part of the tube. Would never buy this item again and avoid Testor product as much as I can.	-1
Not sealing at all.	-1
Doesn't dry firm.  Bought this to fix the head of a model ad once it was dry the head could still move.	-1
Terrible waste of money and ruins models.  The blades arrived relatively dull, became duller very quickly from normal use, and the design is a straight-on edge to edge motion which puts a high amount of stress on the plastic you're cutting i addition to smashing the cutting blades together which further dulls them even faster.  Get a cutter with micro-shear action instead, I recommend the Xuron 410 which is a comparative price to this item or the Xuron 2175ET which costs more but is well worth it for fantastic cutting.	-1
The cutters don't come together perfectly and feel dull. I regret not spending the extra few dollars and getting a better pair.	-1
I goofed and didn't read farther enought down in the description section.  I thought it was one piece my error.  I'm keeping it for a future birthday.	-1
This product is okay though it seems like it was cheaply made. Some of the parts did not really fit very well but that might be just me. You will need some glue to make the parts fit and stay. The front of the car where the lights are do not stay in very well. I am sure that is something that can be fixed with glue.	-1
My mistake...I thought it was already assembled. It has to be assembled and painted. The child did not show any excitement over this.	-1
Hard to use	-1
Not as good as some.  Won't fix the cracks in my fingers for very long.	-1
I got this to do with my 4 year old. Just to get her excited about science. Well it arrived on time and in perfect condition.  I think it was a pretty good deal, but it really needs other stuff to do the experiments. I ended up not doing anything with her because I always forget to look at what I need. As a busy single mom I was hoping that most of the stuff required would be in the box.	-1
OKay I guess for anything but Ceramic cups.  I've tried three brands that all say they stick broken cups.  Well they don't.  Followed directions to the letter and the handle fell off every time as if nothing was there.  Pro's use epoxy and I've ordered what they use.	-1
the packages inside were very small and the instructions lacked detail. My girls, age 7, who make so much slime they are experts had a hard time with this kit and eventually quit trying and left it alone and now it is sitting, will just throw away. The one thing they have used over and over is the small cups that come inside. Perfect slime size cups!!!	-1
This a total waste of money. The box is driving, looks like u r getting a nice big kit of experiments. But it's literally a small pack of baking soda, citric acid vegetable oil and some color tabs. The kids mix the ingredients and it goals. For the price u could hace bought 59x the amount of stuff and did it urself. Very disappointing.	-1
Not what I thought it was...I thought it was a book with lots of different science experiments with reproducibles...it's a one time experiment...  I usually never send things back but these had to go.	-1
when the box this was in arrived, i was very excited... my son is spectrum and obsessed with magnets, so i was looking forward to adding this to his magnet basket... first... the package exploded inside the box, it wasn't sealed in any way... the 2 end caps on the plastic cylinder that was supposed to contain this had popped off , leaving the magnet and tube floating free in the box with magnet sensitive objects... as well it is poorly constructed, very cheap looking, everywhere the tube is sealed shut is a bubbly milky white, not the same clear plastic as the tube and it does not respond well at all to the cow magnet included... we had better luck with magnetized hematite.  all in all i think i would have done better to make something out of filings and a mason jar...	-1
My son is a magnet freak!  He wanted these "Dowling Magnets" for one of his Christmas gifts.  He took it out of the box, checked it out for about 3 minutes, and hasn't picked it up again since.  Nothing special here.  Sorry folks!	-1
fell apart right away!	-1
Was fun at first... but after a short time the tube got cloudy and now you can't really see inside. Too bad. At least the magnet is decent quality.	-1
disappointed. my 6 year old daughter was excited to see this and we went out at night to see the stars.  we saw NOTHING when we looked toward the sky.  :(  returned!	-1
Toys - they just keep getting cheaper and cheaper.  The fins on the rockets lasted a few days before they started breaking off.  It's cheap plastic that is just waiting to break.  We kept it a few months, then threw the whole thing away.  Disappointed.	-1
This product did not deliver as I thought it would. The material is cheap and the rocket popped apart after one use. We ended up having to kind of hold it gently to keep hose on. My son was frustrated over product and it has set in a box since just after Christmas. I would not purchase again.	-1
I don't feel like these were very durable.  My kids really enjoy it anyway.	-1
the stand falls apart have to hold it together	-1
Almost unusable! The stand doesn't hold even its self up. Once the rocket is on there it falls. Someone has to sit and hold it straight	-1
Really...really disappointed  in this. This was not sturdy at all n in the end we had to tape everything  for it to hold. Once we tape the 3 parts together  we still couldn't  get it to shot straight  up.	-1
I bent the handles with moderate hand pressure. These pliers are useless. I can't understand the good reviews. Very soft steel and they don't bend 90 degrees. Total waste of money.	-1
Poor quality, don't like.	-1
This toy falls apart easily. Required lots of duct tape but with enough rigging can work well	-1
When I opened the sealed box I found it was missing one of the 3 pieces that makes up the launch stand.  It was too late to exchange it.  Was a gift and beyond the return time by the time I saw the problem	-1
it was fun for about 10 minutes... so poorly constructed it fell apart.  My son was so sad when he couldn't use it anymore.	-1
Broke after a few uses and the plastic was almost as thin as paper. Save your money	-1
The stand on this is awful. It tips over every time and frustrates my kids. The rockets are made of poor quality foam and the red tips already broke off.	-1
Fun toy but not durable at all. We've Owen for three weeks and it's already falling apart. Go with something a little more durable - not worth $20.	-1
Quickly broken with normal use	-1
Burns glow plugs fast don't buy	-1
Worse product ever. Stand is crap. Falls apart every time you shoot a rocket. Don't waste your money.	-1
You need to hold the launcher that the frustrating part. The base isn't actually a base, it keeps falling apart.	-1
<div id="video-block-R1JQOO5FRVCGJR" class="a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"></div><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1Vl2iqaq5S.mp4" class="video-url"><input type="hidden" name="" value="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A19725TCxrS.png" class="video-slate-img-url">Because the materials are cheaply made, the stand falls over easily. When we stomped on the "pump," the rocket launcher would often move in an unpredictable direction.  If it's a bit windy out, it easily blows the stand into a different direction than you placed it. No matter how careful you are being, this is a safety hazard since it could launch right towards a person. It did launch at my child even though he was properly placed away from it. Luckily he hadn't stomped very hard. It was a failed launch and did not injure him, but it very well could have and that's the last time we used it.  You can't expect a child to be able to stomp on the pad perfectly every time. I would hate to think what would happen if it tipped and launched full speed at someone's eye.  The warnings state not to aim the rocket at your eyes, however if it moves while being launched, there is no way to properly aim it. Not worth the risk and not very much fun since you have to constantly try to redo it's positioning. It especially falls over on grass; a hard surface is obviously a better choice, but I would say that many people have grass in their back yards where they would want to be laughing the rocket.  We also experienced this issue on concrete.	-1
So the reviews were really good for this. I bought it for $15.00 but I'm really not happy with it. My kids are 5, 7 & 8 and like the idea of this but it just isn't functional. The yellow stand it comes with is garbage. Literally falls apart in 3 pieces after one or two times stomping on the toy to make it go. It goes high.. it's worth five bucks though. They carry around launcher part without the yellow stand. we've lost 2 rockets so far within 2 days. buyer beware...	-1
The plastic yellow feet are pretty useless.  I am going to have to duct tape them together to get it to stay standing.  That being said, when I sit there and hold it for the kids it works great and is fun for them.	-1
I think i might have gotten a used one because the foam on the arrows were chipped off and the whole toy was dirty. The toy itself is made of really cheap material, definitly returning it.	-1
Fell apart with in one use. Very cheap, would not bother with	-1
Very poor quality control. Six of the 7 puzzles were fine, but one was completely defective (there were marks where holes should have been, but they weren't drilled, and the instructions were not printed on it like they were on the others). The problem with the defective item was apparent as soon as I opened the package, so it appears the company just doesn't check the quality. The other six were entertaining for our 8 and 11-yeqr-olds for a while, and the price was certainly fine.	-1
Parts were missing from this game so we ended up returning.	-1
These are great games to have around - however, they need to be playable.  These are such poor quality that they can't be used.  The pegs do not stand in the drilled holes. There is no way you can keep the pegs upright while trying to complete a game.  The high star reviews all sound like they purchased them for others or have not taken them out of the box to try and play a game.  BEWARE.  I know they were cheap, but does that mean they can't be drilled with proper sized holes?  A smaller drill bit would have done the job.	-1
For the price it is what it is.  Wish I listened to those saying the pegs aren't sized right and the tip out of the hole.  In the end not worth the bother to return but won't be using them as expected for sure.	-1
Very flimsy legs but can be used without just holding the hose.	-1
The base wouldn't stay together and we finally had to duct tape it (then we couldn't take apart for easier storage) and it just wouldn't stand up well. More frustrating than fun...	-1
this toy was a good idea.. with poor execution. It is very flimsily made.. the stand that you put the rocket on falls over very easily. the rockets themselves are pretty poor quality as well. I got this for my kids for Christmas last year it only got used a handful of times before they got tired of continually readjusting the launcher and then it just broke altogether.	-1
Product was fun but cheap and did not last long.  The part you step on to launch the rockets lacks pressure.  It takes an adult to launch it any real distance.	-1
