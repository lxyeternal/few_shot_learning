nice	1
Put this on my 1995 F-350.. Fits great and feels so much nicer than the bare wheel  and definitely nicer than my old worn out cover, which by the way was one just like this. I got 5 years out of the old one. Hope to get that or more from this one.	1
Fit tightly onto the ends of the crossbars.  Note: If you are JUST ordering the crossbars, you will need to order the end caps separately; it does not come with them.  If you are ordering the feet and fit kit, they are included with the feet.  I did purchase this separately because the ends of the bars can be sharp, and I wanted the extra set in case one gets lost.	1
Insane! - Love the Thule Line of products - Tossed my Car Top Tent on top of it (Tepuitents.com) and off I go into the wild Green Forest!	1
Returning. Things falling apart. Horrible	-1
Excellent	1
This is my second Ford Diamond Plate Grip Steering Wheel Cover. The previous cover lasted three and a half years and would have lasted a lot longer but it started showing some wear and I wanted a fresh one. It looks good on the steering wheel and the logo is sharp.  What I don't like is they are very difficult to get on and have a little tag that has to be trimmed off or it's irritating to the hand.	1
Fits my 15.5 inch wheel but did require two people to install (exceptionally tight fit)	1
ive had this for several months now and am surprise by how well it has held up! For the price I expected it to show signs of use quickly but it still looks brand new after thousands of miles driving with it.	1
It will not come off,#1.	1
Looks great once install. But be sure you warm it up with a hair dryer lay in the sun something or it will not stretch properly. Otherwise it looks great.	1
Great steering wheel cover. The grips are very nice, makes turning the wheel easier and less likely to slip out of your hand if you tend to drive with one hand.	1
Fits, feels and looks great	1
Nice n comfortable! Slim grip not like other bulky wheel covers.	1
It was a bit of a struggle to get it stretched over the wheel but, when finished it looks nice and very comfortable.	1
I loved this item for my truck, I'm currently looking for the chevy version. Nice quality feels good and fits snug.	1
Fits on the steering wheel of my 2006 F-150 perfectly and it feels really nice in my hands.  The rubber areas also give you tons of grip so you don't have to worry about the wheel slipping.	1
My wife and daughter is happy with this wheel cover in my daughter's car. It feels good whenever I drove her car. The grooves will massage your hand while driving and instinctively the grip-hold is solid. When you make a turn, the non-groove portion is somewhat slippery to turn the wheels. So we pay close attention how we hold the steering wheel when we make turns because of that slippery portion of the cover. Other than that, this is good a wheel cover. Installation is quick and easy.	1
My steering wheel was wearing out, so I decided to buy this product.  The price point was great, reviews were great and looked tough.  All three aspects are reasons why I agree it deserves five stars.	1
This fits snugly and looks very good on my old 1993 F150 IL6.  It was easy to install and is easier to do when it is hot outside.	1
I like the diamond style grip pattern, but the pattern is only in three areas and all three of those areas also feature a Ford logo. The logos make the item look tacky (race car appeal?) and is definitely not something I would want in my Ford.	-1
Tight fit and it seems to be well put together. the sun doesn't seem to bother it so that's a good thing.	1
i bought this because i just got a new ford fusion and i also wanted to protect my steering wheel from heat but i didn't want an all leather cover. this one is mostly leather but the grips are plastic which makes for better steering i think. it was easy to put on (for me as a female) and it was only $10. i love it.	1
This steering wheel cover is made of good quality. The grip is great and it fits the steering wheel perfectly.	1
I bought this because my steering wheel was always getting dirty. It works well and is pretty comfortable, a good buy.	1
Cover is easy to put on once you warm it up as instructed. If the item is cold, installing is impossible. The stock steering wheel is plastic and very slick, this cover helps the grip.	1
Used this to replace an old steering wheel cover and the grips make it easier to use in the winter and also give it a rugged look, which is perfect for a truck.	1
I bought this because i needed to add another item to the cart so i could get the free shipping and found this steering wheel cover. Unfortunately i sold the truck before i got a chance to put this cover on. It does looks and feel good!	1
when i first got this cover i didn't think it would fit, but after heating it up in a bucket of hot water it slipped on my steering wheel like a glove. and you can't beat the price. $10 for a steering cover that is perfect.	1
Installed this in less than 5 minutes, looks real sharp; Matches the interior and truck body just fine and I wish I'd foundd matching floor mats.	1
I really like this cover. there is no smell like some reviewers claim,Glad i didn't go buy them, the grip feels really good and secure. good price! all is good thank You.  pitbullman	1
I just put this on my Ranger's steering wheel the other day. It looks cool and feels good. It keeps the steering wheel a bit cooler which is a plus. It makes the steering wheel a bit beefier, but it has a better feel to it so that's fine with me. I'd recommend this to any Ford owner to add a little bit of customization to their interior. Hopefully it lasts.  Update on 5/28/14: It's been almost 2 years since I've had this. I took it off the Ranger's steering wheel and slapped it on my F250's steering wheel. It took a little more effort on the F250, but I got it to fit after a few minutes. It's still as comfortable as it's ever been. It hasn't faded or shown any signs of wear. I drive daily and it's held up very well.  I'd buy it again if I ever needed to. It doesn't look like I'll need to replace it in the foreseeable future.	1
wow this Steering Wheel Cover is really look nice on my police car i love it soon i buy more for other ford car	1
Pros   Thick Rubber   Easy to Clean   Holds well  Cons   They didn't fit in more than 5 places   Rubber mats do not look or feel good on carpeted flooring   Bad customer service   Bad return policy  I needed both mats for a 2003 Nissan 350Z.  The website has all sorts of claims about how well their mats fit.  This is not true in my case.  They were not a perfect laser-measured fit.  They were not even a good fit.  They gapped in more than 5 places.  I had no intentions to return the mats, and I wanted Weathertech to succeed, so I contacted them by email just to let them know the mats do not fit the 350Z well. When I contacted Weathertech by email, Mr Heisler told me in several emails that I was reviewing the website incorrectly, and if they weren't a perfect fit, they were most certainly a very good fit.  I responded that the website should really make it clearer.  He then sent me screenshots of the website with areas circled where I was quite obviously wrong.  After his 3rd demeaning email on how wrong I was, I showed the mats and emails to several friends who told me flat out to return the mats. They did take the mats back, however I had to eat the shipping, and I didn't see the partial refund for weeks.  For the same amount of money, I bought mats from Nissan.  They were of better quality, and they fit perfectly. Summary:  Had Weathertech treated me better through email, or even returned my shipping (as this was clearly not my fault they sent me mats that didn't fit), I would not have returned the mats, even though they didn't fit.  In addition, Ive talked to others interested in mats, and my experience has cost Weathertech more sales.	-1
We are so pleased with these mats. First of all, they are made in AMERICA, and they are well  made. Not flimsy or thin.  They fit perfectly in our car. Job well done Weather Tech!	1
good quality mat just not made to be in a small sedan like a lancer shouldve went custom great quality	-1
I was in a hurry when I ordered these mats for my FX35 and I didn't read the reviews. Boy do I wish I did, the description is misleading making me think these mats were made for my car. They are not, this is a ridiculously high price for universal mats. They don't fit any better that $20 mats from autozone.	-1
Thought I'd hate these, but very handy and fold away to nothing.	1
Pro:  Inexpensive, attractive and adjustable to hold both small and large drinks and mugs.  Con: Holds drinks well when stationary, but weak plastic detents in adjustable arms allow drinks to fall from holder under normal driving conditions, boat use is definitely out of the question.  Detents are so very weak that although the item is new,  any wear thru use will probably make them completely useless.  Disposition: Trash rather than mess with it, learning experience	-1
Bought this for my travel trailer.  There was no place to set a drink down if you were sitting on the couch.  Installed this on the wall next to the couch and problem solved.	1
Work.ol	1
I use these every morning I am in my motorhome for coffee cup holders.  I love 'em, and in fact, these are two replacements for the original cup holders I installed in the RV in 2004.  I find that they are really ideal because they are folded up out of the way until they are needed.  They also get a workout when we have guests over for cocktails and extra glass holding surfaces are needed.  The only reason I did not rate them 5 star is that they are not very rugged and you can break them easily (a pretty minor deal really).	1
man these things are awesome i love them easy to install too	1
Used this on my 2001 Miata which has no usable cupholders.  I was able to use an existing screw for the center console and drilled a hole in the cup holder to get it in the right position. Some Velcro tape at the bottom secures it to the carpeting and it's sturdy enough for me.	1
Made very well and heavy compared to other holders.	1
Easily installed in our camper.  Now I have a convenient place to put a drink next to the sofa.  Folds up out of the way when not in use.  Adjustable for various size containers.	1
These work great in my camper. been needing cup holders for years. very sturdy and well made. we love them. Mounted on walls at both ends of the couch.	1
Most use on of these in a van, pickup or RV. Mine works great mounted on the side of my model train layout!  Prevents spills while keeping drinks convenient for the engineer.	1
These are nice install one in my trailer for the wife holds a bottle a water with no problems and flods flats when not in use	1
it works	1
These work great, hold large cups. Heavy duty compared to the ones I had.	1
When I bought these I thought when the bottom was folded up, the top would collapse like another in a different coach, well they do not. It takes two actions to close it up but still good, works to do the job required and the color is good	1
I like them.  They function perfectly and come with the 4 screws to install it.  Fit/finish could be a little nicer, but overall it does what I need it to.  I installed three of them in my camper and they all function perfectly.	1
Well made and good value!	1
Good quality, easy to install.  Will hold various sized drinks including 1 liter bottle	1
Perfect for travel trailer at each bunk bed and beside the coach.	1
will buy again	1
Works great, sturdy and holds most any size coffee mug or glass	1
Great cup holder for anyplace that you need one that folds up.	1
Purchased two of these and mounted them in our class A motorhome cockpit area. Nice and sturdy and easy to mount.	1
We needed some cup holders, for our new camper; so we ordered these. We couldn't be more pleased with them. They are very well made, easy to install, adjustable and the tan color was perfect.	1
Very Good and Steady Product. Thanks	1
Made of good quality.  Better than I expected.	1
Really nice looking drink holders. Quality is good for price.	1
Heavy duty, great design and high quality material. No not all plastics are the same. I am really impressed with this cup holder that I bought another.	1
these things are great cup holders and install easy on a flat surface	1
The tan color blends with our decor very nicely; not so obvious/obtrusive as the darker colors (who wants black squares on their walls?)  Even though we have tables/nightstands, we have four of these in our RV; two in the main living area and one on either side of our bed.  The two by the bed helps prevent inadvertent spills in the middle of the night.  The other two help keep the small space organized because our kids know to put their drinks in the cupholders instead of leaving them laying around.	1
The screws were too small	-1
I mounted this on my wife's walker so she could carry her water bottle with her when she goes out of the house.  I read the negative reviews and have found if you use the proper size bottle with the diameter of a soft drink can it works great with no problems of falling out. The unit so far has taken a lot of abuse as it is mounted on the outside of the walker frame and gets bumped when taken in and out of the car when traveling.	1
This cup holder was an exact replacement for the ones in our RV. They would probably last as long as the RV if we didn't always have the grandkids crawling all over the RV. I like having the grandkids crawling all over the RV so I will just continue to replace the cup holders and everything else until they grow up. For now, I'm a happy "Papa" with this product!	1
Works Great	1
Won't lock securely enough for big 44 ounce cups	-1
As advertised, sturdy well made cup holders fold up out of the way until they are needed. Adjustable to hold a variety of things including an assortment of cups, cans, and bottles.	1
as advertized	1
I bought similar ones for our boat.  They worked out so well that I bought these for our trailer.  They are mounted to the wall on either side of the bed for our morning coffee.  I love how adjustable they are and that they neatly fold away between use.  They look good too.  I was concerned they may look out of place but they blend in well with our d&eacute;cor.	1
just mounted this and already one of the arms won't stay closed just keeps opening and I see no way to contact seller to replace	-1
ordered 5 of these so far great product	1
Exactly the product we needed for our camper in exactly the color we wanted!  It's versatility allows for different diameter of cups and glasses, beer bottles, cans, etc.  We are very happy with them.  Exceeds expectations and we have already had a LOT of use from these products in two different campers.  LOVE!	1
Excellent.....sturdy.....great value	1
Works Great!	1
Works great in camper!	1
Perfect addition to the motorhome cockpit and it matches !!!	1
Easy install. thx.	1
Simple and works great	1
Exactly like our original, which was accidentally broken. Not super-durable, but inexpensive & reliable.	1
I got these for my outside wooden deck furniture. Flip up out of the way and flip down to hold your drink or flip up the arms and hold your nacho cheese! They look cool too. Every one says..."What the heck are these?" Then they flip it open and everyone always says..."Cool, where did you get these?" The only con was that they, even with the arms flipped out of the way, the base in not big enough for large ceramic coffee cup but it does hold the take out or fast food cups and big gulps just fine. So I got a new large ceramic coffee cup with a tapered base: problem solved.	1
Love these little guys.  Can put them about anywhere and they hold more than just coffee.  Use them in bathroom for spray, beside for water....many uses.	1
Perfect for a hard to fit older Benz.  Installed above handles for added support although I think they would be fine alone.  Priced right.	1
Good job! Thanks.	1
These are really nice. It just seem there never a place to put a drink in your RV the color is a petty good match for the average baize trailer but not perfect. But they don't stand out either.	1
The lights work great and adding a second set of lighta really helps here in the northwest. The included switch was cheap and worthless since my F150 has an auto-on light feature and I wanted to run them wihen the light were on. So I just cut it out of the diagram and by-passed it.	1
these came in about 12 days- amazon free shipping is slo... there is an internal black reflector that dims the light for foglight use, do yourself a favor and open up the unit and unscrew this black housing, to increase luminosity. installation is striaghtforward for foglamps. the wires included are bare, you may want to buy some wire loom. for the relay switch, i spliced it into the low beam headlamp hotwire to turn on when the lows are on. excellent light output. no complaints, sorry no pictures,	1
I had Hella Optilux 1002 fog light 2 years ago, that wasn't bright enough even i put the 35w HID in there, this time I'm going to use non-projector light for the fog light and use 50W HID in it!, this light come with the everything you need, durable cable, reply, switch, etc. for this price and its quality, i would say i found a good one, although the HID is bit hot especially I'm using the 50W, the chrome on Hella Optilux 1002 fog light stripped a bit on it because the hotness of HID. with the 50W HID 3000K on it, i can even use it as the driving light!!! sweet! with HID in there i needed to modify the hole in the back for the HID bulb to be fit, and use silicone to seal, that only need a small file and small silicone cost me only about $6.  after a year of use this light with 50W HID in it. I like to use it a lot even in good weather, the light brights up the road.... but just recently one of the the lens broken but still works and the hosing still in good shape. I don't know what broke my len but I will leave it that way for a while!	1
California has stupid Broad Daylight Head Light laws here.  Got stopped in Roseville, Ca. for not having my Headlights ON in BROAD DAYLIGHT.  These will Definitely get their attention!  LOL!	1
Not installed yet, but appear high quality	1
they are bright i custom  them to fit hid lights 5000k's kensun, a lot of wire splicing but well worth it... sometimes i drive with just them on they work great	1
Install was easy. They looked good and worked fine.  Unfortunately the reflective coating behind the bulbs started to peel away (from the heat??) and then they stopped working.  They worked for 7 months just fine, and since the price was so good, I am not too upset.  I still like Hella products.	1
Awesome, works like a charms.....	1
Not too bad of lights; I had purple HID's which are hard to see at night.. plus i then tinted my headlights (I know.. not the best idea) so i bought these to use as a substitute for the light my headlights were supposed to give out.	1
GREAT SET OF LIGHTS USING ON TRACTOR	1
perfect	1
For their size, these lights provide just the right amount of fill-in to augment the regular headlights and let you see the sides of the road in the middle of nowhere (can't comment on their use in fog as we don't get much here in Tucson).  I followed other recommendations and removed the bulb guard.  When adjusted correctly, I have had no lights flashed my way for blinding someone.	1
Nice lights, but definitely short range.  Bright for up close and good light to the sides.	1
Purchased 1 1/2 years ago for my truck. Both lenses cracked, seals broken, one filled with water, reflectors corroded. The shields to prevent direct light from the bulb going forward both broke off from vibration, scratching the reflectors.	-1
I used these to make new ATV headlights, no high and low, but work very well!!	1
Put these on my girlfriend's 07 Cobalt. She raved about the added visibility so I took her car for a drive with them in really dense fog, and sure enough these lights cut through the fog and gave me perfect visibility. Easy install, quality wires. I like the look of the button included but am paranoid about battery drain by any switch with a light indicator so I used a plain push button switch instead of the included switch.	1
I installed these on my girl friend's 1995 Mustang to supplement the low beams. Very good product, nice light pattern. Instructions are very easy to follow. No problem with the supplied on/off switch just finding a suitable mounting surface on the Mustang's curvy instrument panel. Might upgrade the bulbs to a bit brighter and whiter ones.	1
I returned these due to quality concerns, particularly the harness and interior switch.  I've mounted three pairs of PIAA's previously and these simply did not match the quality construction of the PIAA's.  Of course PIAA make you pay for the quality!	-1
i have had these on my jeep for over two years now and i have had no problems with them. they have been through rain and snow and salt from the road and still work. i am still using the original bulbs in them too. i did switch out all the screws in them for hex heads because i prefer them more. great light. no problems	1
Got my lights mounted and wired in about 2 hours out the bumper of my Ram these worked great and the included LED switch was a nice suprise, would highly recommend.	1
These are very cheap lights but worth the money. They light up the road ahead very well and they are easy to mount. I took the shield off the bulb and haven't been flashed by oncoming traffic. Just be sure to aim them no higher than the lowbeams, preferably lower. The seal is heat activated so if you take them apart do it before installation.	1
These make great backup lights for a trailer hitch.  Flip these babies on and you can see what you are doing.	1
Purchased in 2012. These were okay for a while, although they didn't give off as much light as a different pair (from another mfr) mounted next to them. They developed a blackish deposit on the inside of the lenses, presumably from the black bulb shield. Now one of them is leaky after recent rains.  I recommend that you look for another product.	-1
did not last 4 months	-1
I mounted these on the bumper of my Ford F250. They are about 24" off the ground; not too close to the pavement by any means. The housings started to leak within a week or two of being installed. I removed the lights and tried sealing with black silicone, but they still leaked. Perhaps because of the leak, the chrome started flaking off within a few weeks.  I now have very good looking lights, which leak, produce nearly no helpful light, and won't stay aimed in the direction I angled them.	-1
I searched long and hard for some fog lights for my new bumper but just couldn't find any that I liked that would fit in the precut holes until I stumbled across these. They work great! They are better than the stock fog lights I had on my 2007 F150.	1
The reviewers here who say to remove the black lens covering are not increasing their ability to see better, only increasing the glare to other drivers.  They are also breaking the seal  and allowing water intrusion to do so, for no benefit.  The light pattern of these is not ideal but for the price is fine. Mount them properly, aim them properly, and use them in conditions that warrant their use and only then, and they are an effective product.  But too many use automotive lighting incorrectly, thinking that a huge blast of light is allowing them to see better, when in all actuality all it is doing is constricting their pupil sizes, and vision, and blinding oncoming traffic.  I hope cops start ticketing these fools who are using auxiliary lighting improperly, or retrofitting HID bulbs into halogen housings.	1
Everything they said they are.  Wiring is a bit cheap and the switch quit working after 2 days.  Other than that they are decent.	1
I was looking for something to install on the rear of my 5th wheel for backup lights. The design of these lights fit the bill perfectly. They make a nice clean installation and enhance the look of the trailer. I'm very happy with my purchase.  Gary	1
ITS THE BEST LIGHT I ORDERED FOR MY SILHOUETTE BECAUSE A PEBBLE BROKE MY LAMP ,AND IT WAS EASY TO INSTALL  ,THANK YOU  AMAZON,COM	1
These were bought to replace a previous pair that died after 8 years of abuse.  No problems with them so far.	1
I read other reviews of these lights and thought they might be a good bargain with a little effort. As soon as I got them I took them apart and removed the defuser.  You MUST pay attention to how you aim your lights when you do this.  Also, be very carefull making sure you line the gaskets up well when you put the lights back together. The install hardware was ok and they went in easily.  The lights are nice and bright and well worth the money and minimal effort I put in to them.  I can't comment on how they are out of the box but I think they're great if you have phillips screwdriver and a little time.	1
I bought these to mount on my tractors snowblower to help with visibility when it is dark out. The tractors lights are okay but don't put out a lot of light. These light up my driveway great when I have to snowblow in the dark. Pretty good for the price.	1
Installed on my Ram 1500 for extra fog lights.  Easy install, pattern is perfect, almost like driving with OEM low beams.  Switch that comes with it is crap, I didn't even bother trying to use it.  I also switched out the bulbs recently to the 36 LED (red) and they produce a little bit of light.  Would definitely recommend, probably going to buy 2 more pairs for another vehicle.	1
Mine was about cost, I only use them seldomly,so to put a lot into it, was not an option. It would be nice if it replaced my oem fog lights and just plugged into clip, but the route that it mentioned in the direction worked great. Easy to understand directions for the new car enthusiast. Would purchase again if needed.	1
Don't let the size of these little fellas concern ya. I purchased them to fit in the small openings in my grill, they fit perfect. The kit comes with lots of different wiring options, all with safety fuse blocks. The lights project a intense wide light. Our Bronco has 10 inches of lift,factory lights just can't put the light down low and to the sides, these little guys fill the spots i needed. Now if i could only find a light bar for the bumper for some big Hella's! Excellent product,just don't expect 500 or 1000 watt performance from a 55 watt light..  :) MB	1
I've had a set of these lamps on my truck for over a year. The Optilux 1450 compare favorably to OEM and mid-range PIAA or Hella lamps. These are true "fog lamps" that project a wide, flat beam. There is a clean cut-off of light at the top of the pattern, making it possible to use these lights with oncoming traffic with the shield removed, if they're properly aimed.  You can significantly improve the performance of these lights by removing the shield from the bulb. The shield is there to prevent poorly-aimed lights from blinding oncoming drivers. If you know how to properly mount and aim fog lamps you should remove the shield. If you are the type of person who doesn't fuss over the fine points such as careful aiming and maintenance, please leave the shield in place.  Remember that they are supposed to be aimed low to fill in the gap under your regular lights. They are not distance lights, and by themselves fog lamps don't provide a whole lot of light. Properly aimed, they work with your regular headlights to give a wide, fairly even light coverage to a moderate distance in front of the vehicle. If you're not sure how to aim then, get a newish car/truck that has original equipment (OEM) fog/aux lights, go out at night and point the car at a wall in a dark area. Notice the relationship of the bright areas of the fog lamps relative to the headlamps. Aim your lights to copy the OEM pattern.  The shield is mounted to the reflector inside the lamp housing using one small phillips screw. To remove the shield, you need to remove the bezel (two screws), remove the lens, _very_carefully_ remove the gasket, and then you can remove the shield.  Note: The gasket is a thermoset material. It feels a little like silicone but this stuff melts slightly when the light is heat-cycled a few times. For this reason, you should decide if you want to remove the shield before you allow the light to heat up for the first time. If you let the lamp get too hot to touch the gasket will melt. It's supposed to do that. Once it melts, if you subsequently break the seal to remove the shield, the lamp will leak.  (I guess this is also why some reviews complain of leaking lights. I bet the gasket wasn't in the right place, and the lamp never sealed. It might actually be worthwhile to remove the bezel on new lights and check that the gasket is in place so there aren't any gaps between the lens and the reflector.)  The gasket is floppy and poorly fitting so you just have to carefully stuff it around the edge of the bezel as best you can. That seems to be good enough, because both my lamps sealed nicely and they do not leak.  UPDATE, TWO YEARS LATER: the lights continue to perform well, despite a lot of pounding on gravel roads in the mountains. The finish on one light has peeled and allowed the aluminum housing to corrode. It's ugly, but then again so is the truck, and the cosmetic corrosion doesn't affect the functionality of the light at all. No leakage into the reflector housing. My initial impression has not changed: These lights are an outstanding value for the price.	1
Purchased these as an affordable fog light to compliment a set of Hella 500 Off Road lights which are hoop mounted above my '93 Wrangler's front bumper.  The Hella 500's throw a nice long distance spot a bit higher than the vehicle's headlights, and these Optilux 1450s mounted directly to the top (middle) of the front bumper add a nice low wide beam up close. I did NOT remove the little black bulb covers that many other users refer to, and am totally happy with both the light output and pattern.  I discarded the switch and relay that came with the 1450s and opted for an old school illuminated toggle switch for about $4 here on Amazon.  I was able to drill a small circular hole in a dash panel and easily mount the switch through the hole.  (JT&T Products (2616J) - 20 AMP @ 12 Volt - S.P.S.T., Illuminated On/Off Toggle Switch, Blue).  It is an 18 year old vehicle, after all, so the old school look is perfect. Since I discarded the Optilux switch & relay before using them, I can't speak to their quality or usefulness.  2 month followup.  After a day of bumpy off-roading, the little black bulb covers that many other users refer to in their reviews both came detached and are just vibrating around freely inside the light's housing.  I am going to have to open up the housings and will probably just remove them to avoid having to deal with this on a recurring basis.  Since this vehicle is a toy and used primarily for weekend off-road driving, I am not concerned about the light's impact on oncoming drivers. I have decided to leave this as a four star review despite the little black bulb cover issue.  6 month followup.  Those little black bulb covers had actually BROKEN off.  Regardless, the lights actually are brighter without the covers, so I'm glad they broke off.  Even more recently, I moved the lights to the outside edges of the bumper and rewired them using the relay that was included with the purchase, along with 8 gauge wire to the split, and 16 gauge from the split to each light.  This DRAMATICALLY improved light output.  Previously I had wired them directly to the switch inside the vehicle.  Wiring directly to the battery via relay and thicker wire really really made a huge difference.  I can't emphasize enough how important the wiring actually is, the difference (pun intended) is like night and day.  Good brand, good lights, good price.	1
These aren't the best lights money can buy but these are excellent lights for the price. They were easy to install and the kit had all the parts necessary for a complete installation. As I was installing these lights in a Xterra I had to use extra wire to make the run to the cab. I also replaced the switch with a nice lighted rocker<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Daystar-KU80012-20-Amp-Green-Light-Rocker-Switch-Kit/dp/B001GH5PWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Daystar KU80012 20 Amp Green Light Rocker Switch Kit</a>.  Performance: I have these lights aimed forward, low and more to the side of the road. They do a good job on dark nights and perform fabulous in foggy conditions. Living near the Pacific Ocean I see a lot of fog and the Optilux 1450 does a very good job. There are better fog lights out there but none at this price or even close, to move up to the next level of performance you have to spend three time the amount that these cost. I would rate these a very good buy.	1
These things give off a pretty wide pattern for being so small. they could be a tad bit brighter but they are a fog light which is exactly what i needed. Lights feel well made and sturdy. The wiring harness is very well made. Wire is of good quality and is fairly long however, the load wire that goes from the switch to the relay was not long enough and needed to be extended for my needs. The switch that comes with the kit is really nice and has an LED active light thats red when the lights are off and greeen when the lights are turned on, but i won't be using it.  EDIT: CRAP! lights started to leak. seems like the weather stripping inside around the lens is way too big and doesnt seal right. took the lights off my front bumper and put them on my rear bumper to use as reverse lights since they didn't give me the light output desired. after almost of week of being on my rear bumper they filled up completely with water even worse than they did on my front bumper and one lens also cracked. going to contact the company or seller to see if i can get a replacement lens. READ ALL REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING. THESE LIGHTS ARE NOT THE GREATEST.	-1
I was looking to buy some good fog-lights for my car, I did a lot of research, I was going to go for the Hella FF50, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money, so the second option was the Optilux 1450, like everyone said these are some pretty good quality fog lamps, they feel sturdy, however I agree with Tito's review, don't remove the black shields, as without them the lamps get very hot and you don't want to blind oncoming traffic, I tried a comparison side by side, one lamp with shield and the other one without it, I couldn't see a mayor difference. The cables are good, the only complaint that I have is the plastic switch, it feels a little cheap, but I'm hopping it will hold up.	1
THESE LIGHTS ARE FANTASTIC ! COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THEY ARE, BEING SO SMALL. ADDS LIGHT TO BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD AND HELPS IN HARD RAIN AND FOG. VERY EASY TO INSTALL!	1
Made the car - super. Didn't have an  plastic-y odor and wasn't sticky	1
Girlfriend loved it	1
my son loves it	1
Chinsy cheaply made of thin rubber. Dull. Does not maintain its shape	-1
My daughter bought this for her car. She really likes it. It is of nice quality!	1
loveit	1
Fits very tight on my wife's Suzuki X90 steering wheel so it shouldnt slip. I like it.	1
Great, fun product!  Just what I wanted, oops...what my 4 boys wanted, lol;-)  FYI: Fit may seem questionable at first but, keep stretching it....worked for us!	1
a little large for my steering wheel.	1
great product!	1
Looks great and is still holding strong. No unravelling or frays anywhere	1
I love it...	1
Perfect fitment for my 1999 Honda civic steering wheel. It is a little tight getting on, but I let mine sit out in the sun for about 20 minutes to warm up the rubber material. It then went on perfectly.	1
A nice steering wheel cover	1
Just a little patience and it goes on nice and snug. Line it up so it's centered where you want it before spending the time and effort. I re-did mine since I didn't have it exactly centered but it wasn't a big deal. Looks great!	1
This gives you great gripping areas, a tight fit, seems very well made. I also like the molded color emblems.	1
It's a nice chrome plated piece that can be mounted with the logos on the top or bottom. Remember to pull off the GMC logos and peel off the plastic behind them and push them back hard into to recesses. They are not permanently stuck on due to the interchange - ability of the frame.	1
Heavy, Nice finish and brite  GMC logo.  Is a really good deal as it was a third the cost of most other nice frames.	1
This glue is extremely versatile and calling it emblem glue is limiting its usage.  I did get it to put the emblem back on my car, but have found it to be very good for other purposes as well.  I recently used it to glue rubber pads to the metal base of my son's laptop. It worked out very well despite the base getting very hot.  Also, the cleanup of excess glue, if any, is very easy.  I will highly recommend this product.	1
A bit looser in consistency than I was expecting, but easy to apply. Adequate adhesion. Easy clean up, which is good since it does run a little.	1
great product	1
Good	1
Product worked exactly as I needed. Thank you	1
Won't hold any thing. For being 3m very disappointed.	-1
Very sticky. Holds the logo on very well.	1
I bought this product specifically to put a plastic chevy logo back to the car. I was horrified to see that the product ate through the plastic and irreversible damaged the whole emblem, melted it into a wobbly wavy plastic and totally destroyed the whole emblem. I couldn't be more disappointed as I specifically bought this product to use with an emblem on the car.	-1
Used it to attach 1/8 stainless steel plate to aluminum door for license stickers..worked perfectly.	1
I love this adhesive. Great for trim and other uses as well. Strong and stays somewhat flexible.	1
works good	1
works as promised	1
Excellent!	1
This stuff is worth its weight in gold	1
works great as usual	1
A dab'll do ya. Use sparingly and follow directions. Apply, let tack, THEN position and affix. Great product.	1
I used this to adhere the center Nissan emblem from my old plastic hubcaps to my new hubcaps, which were exact replacements for my old ones but came without the center emblem.  I taped them in place while the glue set and left them for 24-hours.  Worked like a charm and you'd be hard pressed to remove them now that the adhesive has cured.  This adhesive was well worth the cost.	1
Item came just as described. Would definitely recommend and buy again. Great product with a good price. You won't be dissatisfied with purchasing this one over others.	1
I do different projects and this seems to hold well compared to other products	1
Works extremely well on most applications. Repaired grill on a Trailblazer with great results.	1
Works great	1
great product	1
I thought it might bond a little more solid than it does, still an excellent product	1
product arrived on time and as described	1
Good product, works as specified, but no miracle cure.  Follow the instructions and the glue will stick.	1
Nothing else needs to be said.	1
Worked perfect mounting plastic fasteners into a metal sign cabinet.	1
This stuff works well. The set time was a little slower than I would have liked and be sure not to get it on new paint, as it will eat right through it. As for reattaching emblems, it does the job well	1
Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you	1
worked well to reinstall body moldings on car	1
So far (about two months) in mixed weather from about 65 degrees to 100 plus, rain, shine, and everything in between, this adhesive is holding the plastic door handle "cleat" onto my wife's Kia. It was designed from the factory to friction fit onto a fluted stud "poking" out of the door handle assembly, but the thin brittle plastic broke around the cylinder designed to receive the stud.  I cleaned all surfaces with denatured alcohol before starting the exercise.  I first glued the cleat gasket to the painted metal door (more of friction/squeak-preventer than a gasket; feeling like slippery, but hard polyethylene).  I then glued the electroplated chrome plastic (hard, brittle polystyrene, maybe) cleat to the "gasket" and taped the assembly in place overnight while the adhesive set up.  The next day, all of the elastic-feel in the surface bonding was gone and the plastic was tight to the metal-  very tight-  no twist or movement whatsoever.  It felt incredibly solid, and as I wrote, after two months- still incredibly solid.  NOTE:  I did not realize (deficient research) that the 8061 acted like a contact adhesive so you have to pre-coat both contact surfaces, stick them together, pull them apart, wait, then REALLY stick them together.  It's clear in the manufacturer's instructions (the ones I did not read before purchase).  This wasn't a problem for me, just make sure you follow the appropriate steps.  I also hadn't realized, that the adhesive is thin, almost watery.  It WILL run and is difficult to control if you intent to "pool" it.  Except where applied very thinly, it seems to retain some of the gumminess, for a long time- maybe forever.  Regardless-  it has excellent holding power and considering the amount of surface areas in contact for my application, I am thus far impressed.  3M-  you may be pricey, but my experience is that rarely is the extra money ill-spent.	1
I needed a good clear adhesive for my emblem that had come off my hub cap.  This did the job.  I just hope it does not yellow with age. I'll keep you posted	1
GOOD STUFF---USED BY ALL PROFESSIONAL BODY SHOPS	1
Great  seller, fast and good products.  A+++++++++	1
works great they ship fast	1
Work well	1
Product really works well. Used it apply an emblem to the rear of my car almost a month ago. Washed car 2 times since then and even went through a carwas. Emblem stayed in place with no issues.	1
I used this for reattaching the red plastic reflector strip onto the aluminum trim panel on the tailgate of a F150. It takes time and a lot of clamps, but it works great. Worth the money and the wait to get it. Tailgate looks stock once again.	1
3M 08061 Plastic and Emblem Adhesive Tube - 5 oz. 3M adhesive that's been around for years and I would not use any thing else. I fully trust these products that are used by body shops across the country for decades for gluing trim, rubber, emblems, etc. Buy with confidence. RagenRat Excellent	1
I've been using this 3M product for many years, and am very happy with the results. It securely bounds all emblems and trim on cars. It lasts forever.	1
Does what it should, I did not have any problem with it eating through paint.  All I can say is don't put it on a new paint job or a new car.  Almost any glue can cause damage to freshly painted cars.  This glue is clear and dries clear.	1
very disappointed in this stuff; way too runny, and when it runs you better get it off your paint fast or it will stain/ruin it. It even sort of melted the molding I was TRYING to glue on!!! DO NOT USE THIS STUFF!!!	-1
It's like 10 bucks or so. This stuff works great. I've found that more flammable it is; the better it works.  I'll pay the higher price for the good stuff , not that " eco friendly " garbage others are trying to sell.  IT's made in the USA .	1
Used this to attach a stubborn chrome strip on my Ford Contour trunk lid back to the car. Its a little hairy to work with I'd try playing around with it first on a test piece just to get a feel for it. It starts out pretty fluid and doesn't seem to harden that quickly (even though it says it bonds quickly). I found the full bond took a full day to get strength, but now it seems like its pretty darn strong. Wish I had used a vice grip to keep the chrome piece in place as I didn't realize it took so long to harden up.	1
As a relatively new cloth convertible top owner I wanted to pro-actively to take good care of my top from the start.  All roads lead to RaggTopp Fabric Protectant, which essentially meant that it has the recommendation of the Hartz Fabric Company recommendation.  I have used this product before and it worked, but this year it was a disaster.  First of all they changed the spray nozzle on the aerosol can to produce an extremely fine spray.  Whatever their reason for this was it now means that it is impossible to use this product outdoors as the slightest of breezes sends it off into the wind.  You must apply it in a garage setting only.  Secondly when my small top failed to bead water after apply three coats per the directions I contacted the manufacture to try to understand what went wrong.  They were far from professional, in fact I would characterize their behavior as nothing less than insane.  First telling me that I did not apply enough.  Then telling me that I applied too much.  And a few other really bizarre comments were sent to me written in all capital letters!  It appears that this company is really just a one man and a bitter and unhappy fellow at that!  But the good news is that this interesting information that I would like to share with you.  This is not the only option for fabric top protectant.  And of the alternatives there is one that had been the defacto Hartz recommended product for over 20 years (RaggTopp was only recommended by them for the last few years - do I smell a bribe, or should I say paid product endorsement?).  The alternative is a product called 303 Protectant - High Tech Fabric Guard.  It is available from Amazon and it is less expensive than Raggtopp.  303 also makes a fabric cleaner.  And 303 has a manual pump spray which allows for much greater control in applying the product.  My top beads water again thanks to 303.  Goodbye RaggTopp, your horrible customer server has turned me and now everyone in my roadster auto club off of your products for good.	-1
This item really restores the original look of the top and seems to save the stitching as well.	1
It is what I was expecting, great product, great shipping!!!!!	1
The very best product on the markit	1
I use this on my '88 Suzuki Samurai soft top.  It is the same top that was on the car when I bought it over four year ago and still looks good	1
Long lasting, superb protection.  My car is now 17 years old with the original top and it's still good.	1
I inherited a vintage cloth top Jaquar - Cloth tops are a Pain in the .... ( you get the idea ) this is a great product that works very well - what ever you do - do not use a silicone base spray - it will ruin your cloth top ! use this product its silicone free !	1
The product does what it says it does, and the item arrived as indicated.  My top is dry and I am happy.  Let me recommend opening your top, draping old bed sheets and/or plastic over your windows and windshield, then set the roof back down (don't lock it down, but set it back into the closed position)...it beats taping every square inch of glass, and it helps keep overspray off of the body of the car.	1
This stuff is real easy to apply. It took longer to mask off the rest of the car than to apply Raggtopp. So far water beads as expected. The price is a little high but if it last 6 months it will be worth it.	1
Tried this out on my Saturn Sky RedLine.  Works awesome.  If you leave your convertible outside, or live in the sunshine states, you need this.	1
Great product but let set for a few days to allow time to dry before you put the top down. It works, beads water, keeps top in looking like new condition.	1
This is a awesome product for waterproofing and protecting your convertible against moisture and UV light!  I first applied two coats on our Smart Passion Cabriolet convertible. Then one follow coat 6 months later,,, it fully beads up and the top looks so lusterous!  This is the original product from Germany and is the best available anywhere. I highly recommend it and the price is excellent!	1
This product does a good job repelling water and dirt and helps to keep a convertible top clean and waterproof.  Even though it is intended for fabric tops, in my experience it works better on vinyl convertible tops (Jeep Wrangler) than the RaggTopp product intended for vinyl.  I use it on both fabric and vinyl convertible tops.  I don't know about the UV protection claims, but I have a 10 year old Jeep Wrangler with the original top and the top still looks new and remains waterproof and the seam stitching is still in good condition.  I also use the product on a 2012 BMW 135i convertible (fabric top) with excellent results so far.	1
RaggTopp Fabric Protectant is a wonderful product. I've been using RaggTopp product for years with great success. After using the cleaner and protectant, my top looks like new!	1
Save your money.  Water beads well for about two weeks, then it's as if you applied nothing.  Silicon is probably just as good, and a lot cheaper!	-1
I have one of these and a UIB-S that I use on my 1995 camper. 1 on the fridge and 1 on the water heater. easy install and flawless performance	1
The OEM ignitor board for my RV water heater was $400.00 AND obsolete. You have to be somewhat conversant in flame rectification ignitors to know that this little board will replace hundreds.	1
This board brought our 1994 furnace back to life.  Very easy installation which saved us a bundle compared to having a tech drive out to our very remote location.	1
Over the years I have had to replace several circuit boards in various RV's. Dinosaur boards are made in the US and they have a better warranty that an OEM board and cheaper. This board can be used in either a furnace or a water heater. These appliances use the same board.	1
I installed this on a Atwood furnace on a 2005 Keystone Everest.  Works great, easy to install. Three screws, unclipped switch and replaced new with old. Done.  The hardest part was removing the furnace unit itself to get access to the panel (some rigs may not require removal of unit).  Highly encourage cleaning the heating tubes and "hamster" wheel while you have your furnace removed.  Makes it run a whole lot better.	1
I just installed this board replacing the original control board on my Atwood G6A-7E gas only water eater.  It is working perfectly.  BTW, the included instructions related to removing a "jumper" for "instant on" as opposed to a 20 second delay are inaccurate.  For "instant on" you need to snip a diode located directly to the far right of the pronged connector.  The instruction there at the diode location is very clear.  Also, if you call Dinosaur Electronics they are very helpful.	1
Ease of install and easy to monitor operation. This was an upgrade for new water heater. Love warranty.	1
This was to replace an unserviceable  board in a Suburban Water Heater. Perfect	1
I have a brand new camper and I have gone through (2) boards in three outings.  I bought this board because I am tired of installing the original stock board, even if it is under warranty.  (Suburban)  I personally do not like taking cold showers.  This board has not failed yet.  If it does, I will edit my review.	1
Works great.  I installed this in a Suburban SF-30 furnace along with a new ignitor.  It already had one of these boards in it but something got inside the unit (a mouse, I think) and damaged a component on the board.  It would blow cold air but not ignite.  After taking it apart I found the damaged component so ordered a new board and replaced the ignitor as well since it was looking pretty old.  Glad to have this furnace working again.	1
Worth the money, works well , I replaced my old factory board	1
The circuit board for an Atwood water heater in my 40 year old motor home quit working just as I was about to sell it.  I ordered this board and was able to install it and get it working again.  I had to cut the indicated resistor to get it to work for instant on.  I only wish the instructions had more technical data.  I am not sure what NC was on the edge connector.  It could mean "no connection" or "normally closed" and it would have been nice to know what it was really for.  My old board had an ignition failure light.  This does not provide that feature.  However, I was just glad to get it working again.  I had to drill some holes in the old mounting bracket to secure it.  Once I did that, it fit perfectly in the space where the old board was. I also had to snip the connector off of the old igniter and replace it with a female connector to attach it to the coil. This was to be expected as there are about three different coil types that are available.	1
Dinosaur is the best, great customer service, worked great......	1
Works great.	1
Have ordered before and this time was for a spare unit - good price and well shipped	1
Quality Parts!! Fast Shipper!!	1
Great quality. Easy install and works great. I recommend buying the cover with it.	1
Works well	1
Worked perfectly!  Better than the original ever did!  I was having a few problems with my Hydro Flame furnace the last year or so. It wouldn't always light. So I would have to keep cycling it on and off. Then I cleaned the contacts, etc. and that seemed to help for a while, but still not always firing. Everything else seemed to be working fine. So I finally decided to replace the board with this one, and now everything works great. I like the fact that it's fuse protected and has LED's to tell you what is going on during the ignition process.	1
Perfect replacement part to have on hand if you own an RV. This will work on furnaces and water heaters.	1
Works perfect and quality Board.  Has the 5 amp replaceable fuse which is nice.  Fast ship. Great deal all around.  Thanks Dinosaur	1
It did the trick. Best price I could find.	1
Worked perfectly! Very simple to install and fits just like the original	1
So far so good, fixed my hot water problem! only used it for one weekend but it worked great!	1
Much better ignition board than original.	1
Got 3 years of hard use out of the old one, I full time camp in New England. Very satisfied	1
Plug n play! Fired right up in my water heater. The same board can also be used in my furnace, and fridge at half the price of OEM parts.	1
Great Product and excellent service! Good price and easy to install. Tip Take a picture of the wiring before you remove the old part. Best price on the net!	1
This is the third upgrade on as many RV, works great and very reliable.	1
This was much cheaper than OEM products and works very well on my old motorhome furnace.	1
This is a great replacement with much better quality and features than the original board. I am very happy that this unit has a replaceable on board fuse. Installed in 10 minutes and worked perfectly and has a great warranty, too!  Local camper dealer wanted $149.00 for the original substandard unit. I Highly Recommend this item !!!!	1
plug and play, and it works	1
Fixed it!  My Suburban water heater was igniting the flame but not sensing that the flame was lit and would just keep sparking and then shut off the gas.  I suspected the board was defective and now it works like a dream.  Better than the OEM board- has better features.  Thanks	1
Worked perfect. It was a simple install in my 2000 Dutchman 5th wheel. It fit exactly like it should and furnace once again blows warm air	1
Works perfectly in either my hot water heater or my fridge.	1
works perfectly	1
Solved my problem.	1
Works fine as advertised.	1
plug and play worked perfect	1
Wrong parts	-1
great works perfect.	1
After I isolated the problem with my RV furnace to the Igniter Board, I had no trouble locating Dinosaur Electronics with a quick Google Search.  Their website is crystal clear on what I needed to order and what it would fit INCLUDING a part number cross reference that included the part number off my bad board.  Copied the Dino part number and nomenclature and pasted in Amazon, BOOM there it was and was eligible for Prime! Bought it instantly. Checked prices elsewhere and no contest. Total transaction time: Less than 15 minutes.  Arrived 4 days later (over the weekend) minute, <5 minute install, furnace lit on first igniter cycle.  FLAWLESS A+++++++ outfit even if they recommend trained installers put this board in.  Highly recommended, and I'm a card carrying curmudgeon.	1
First thing I did when I purchased my DSI 10gal Atwood water heater was throw the board away and install a Dinosaur Electronics UIB.  I have some of these boards in service that have been mistreated, in hot environments, with moisture, with alkali dust; and they STILL keep on doing their job.  If you rely on your appliances, rely on these boards to keep them working top notch.  Thanks Dinosaur!	1
Fits perfect on my 2001 Ram. Very comfortable.	1
This style of material has a very nice tactile feel and fit snug without tearing or stretching. Like the diamond plate texture and the bold graphics are just too cool. Plasticolor has always been a great company that offers excellent products at a reasonable price. Very happy with this purchase.	1
Perfect grips  and will buy again	1
All good baby baby!	1
It did not fit my steering wheel	-1
this is a great wheel cover. nice price.	1
orginal staff	1
Only problem with this is that it slides around a little bit, but it covered up my worn out factory steering wheel.	1
Got this is a gift for my dad to put on his 2012 Challenger very durable design and looks fantastic, definitely would compliment any black interior superbly.	1
This is great on dark color's, mine is black, it really deepens the shine and removes swirl marks fairly effectively. Putting in on,  I use a porter cable buffer which makes it go fast. However, this can be pretty hard to get off. If you do too much as once it can take a lot of elbow grease to remove it. Avoid hot or bright sun which makes removal harder. Do a small portion and remove it quickly. I follow with Perfect it Was and the car looks great.	1
I use this as a "hand glaze" on dark finishes after washing and before waxing to take out most swirls, or blemishes.	1
Fantastic Product.  Keep in mind, this is a glaze, not a compound of polish.  When you read "Swirl Mark remover", they are not referring to swirl marks from a carwash or anything like that, they are referring to swirl marks from a buffer after polishing.  You need to use polish before this product!!!  Minimum Process for this product should be: 1.  Clay Bar 2.  Polish 3.  This Product 4.  Wax	1
It is a great product but it dosen't exactly remove swirls like it says. I would say it's more of a stripper to get all the old wax and build up of other things off it. To remove the haze if you will. It is used best as step one in the restoration of your paint. My recomendation is use the swirl treatment, followed by a clay bar treatment and finish it up with a good wax job. After that you just need to keep up on the wax. This seems to work best for me.	1
I bought the Pilot leather cover for the steering wheel of an old Maxima whose steering wheel was shedding leather bits and looking mighty sad.  The quality of the new cover appears excellent, it is thick, somewhat pliant to the hands, and nicely dyed black.  The appearance of the steering wheel is much improved with this cover.  It took some strength to fit it over the existing wheel.  A buyer should be aware of that.  It does, by its nature, make the steering wheel thicker so the feel will be different.  And, at least on my steering wheel, the inner portion of the old steering wheel is visible under the new cover.  The product really is better than I expected and does dress up the appearance of that old steering wheel.  Replacement or professional recovering for my car is very expensive and this is a MUCH more practical answer.	1
doesn't not fit as described	-1
as expected	1
i just wish that it would remain in one place, as there is no way to secure it.	1
Doesn't work with a 08 Prius , so I stuffed it with a few paper towels , works great now.	1
Make sure it's warm when you put it on because in cold weather it will be very difficult if not almost impossible. Once on, it fits and feels very nice! It looks well made and I have no complaints!	1
Works great an had  no problem with seller or item . very well made hard to put on .	1
i love my steering wheel cover! hate that it's difficult to get ahold of.	1
perfect fit for bmw f10.	1
Received a damaged steering wheel . Even the stitching is coming out on a new product. How is this possible ?	-1
Covers the steering wheel OK, but makes the wheel much larger. It feels strange to drive with it.	1
Great, as listed	1
This is my third Pilot Genuine Leather steering wheel cover.  I have not replaced one yet, I just have one on all three vehicles.  Quality product, much better than the vinyl wheel covers in the auto parts stores.  A little slick in the beginning, but it just gets better with age/time.  My oldest leather cover feels the best!	1
I have used this for over six months and it's in great condition. It grips to the steering wheel great and looks very high quality.	1
Awesome , fit like a glove , well made	1
I must say these are high qaulity covers...make shure you size you steering wheel.  They can be stretched a.bit buy throwing it in the drier for a minute.	1
The flat black leather  steering wheel cover is excellent.  The look and feel with the black/saddle interior is perfect in our Cr-V.  The only suggestion is to realize it will not slip easily onto your steering wheel.  I tried the warming up technique with little success, so I combined the warming with the a 3/4 inch flat bar and wedged the leather into place.  Combining my technique with the warmth made it a snap.  Unless you are very strong getting the cover to just slip on would be very difficult.  Okay, it is on the wheel.  My wife is the primary driver of the Cr-V.  She loves it.  From my experience, the soft feel is very comfortable and a bit luxurious.  If my car was not nearing the end of its lease, I would buy another.  It gives the wheel a better grip because of the softness and increased area for the grip.  Because it is a quality leather, you will fine a nice leather smell that is not annoying like synthetic materials.  There is nothing that could be toxic with this product like in other reviewers have with the synthetic covers.  Would I recommend it?  The answer is an emphatic yes!	1
Great steering wheel cover. It makes my Scion xA interior look nicer. It's a lot thicker than the naked steering wheel but you get used to the thickness very fast. It's not that easy getting it on at first but it fits great once you get it on. The only problem i have with mine is that the stitching on one side is coming off a bit. For cleaning purposes i use a car interior cleaner to wipe the steering wheel. One last thing to note is that it gets really hot to the touch in the summer months.	1
I put this on my 1998 Jeep Cherokee that had a badly worn steering wheel. It was somewhat difficult to install. But it's not going to move or slip. Now the steering wheel has a fatter feel which is ok.	1
I purchased 2 of these; one for a 2003 Honda Accord and another for 2008 Honda CRV. They both fit GREAT! The quality of this steering wheel cover is as described. You just have to work the leather a little when trying to fit it over your vehicle's steering wheel; it fits like a glove!	1
The padding on the cover makes it a little too thick, but the leather is pretty nice.	1
Worked great	1
i love this	1
looks nice, doesn't smell, fits well, not the best leather fell but acceptable.	1
Hard to get over wheel ,but once you do Works great	1
A good steering wheel cover. Very tight to fit in. Hot water may help to soften the material a bit.	1
Everyone knows you can buy a steering wheel cover for less than $10 at various discount stores. in most cases they will be made of vinyl or some other low budget material. In my past experience, I've wasted my money with such bargain steering wheel covers, they usually don't fit well and slide around when driving making them dangerous. Not to mention the smell the vinyl gives off when exposed to sunlight which probably is responsible for making them stretch. The Pilot SW-101 is very well made having a rubber backing to prevent slippage and it stitched neatly in three places. It has a nice genuine leather feel and will keep your steering wheel looking new or make it look new if yours is cracked or peeling. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra for the real deal.  Fits my Hyundai Genesis Sedan perfectly and looks great. I will order again for my other cars.	1
perfect fit	1
Thin. Hard to get on! All good qualities of a solid and reliable wheel cover!	1
I put this on a 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek steering wheel, and it definitely made it nicer to use.  Less heat/cold transfer in extremes and it has a nicer more supple grip than the standard wheel.  It is a bit thicker than I expected, but that doesn't bother me thus far.	1
This did fit well on our 2006 Jeep Liberty stock steering wheel. It does make the steering wheel feel bigger but you get used to it very quickly	1
All worked as described and as expected	1
Feels soo nice and not to mentions looks great in my car!	1
This fits the steering wheel of my 06 Ford F150 (Very Tightly) Real leather (Very Nice) and smells like it. (Not stinky plastic) Large feel but works great with my large hands.	1
Fits Ford Edge without superhuman streingth or tools. Not so much on f-150, super human streingth , heating in a dryer , a set of plastic pannel tools and a roll of duck tape a must. No im not joking. It will fit but not without a 3rd hand. If you have ever put one on you know that the tape is so you don't loose ground while trying to streatch it with out it slipping back off, be persistant and have a friend with kung foo grip and it will go.	1
I had a really hard time getting this on.  I was about to use soap water to help it slide but was able to eventually get it on without it. I got it on straight where the sewing is matched up evenly on both sides.	1
Covers my car's (2014 Honda Accord) steering wheel perfectly. At first it was a bit tough to get one, but once on there, it's snug and doesn't slide around at all. Love it.	1
Excellent quality product!	1
Like it.  Fits my Datsun steering wheel perfectly.  No smell.  Easy install.	1
I bought this for my 2003 ram pickup because the steering wheel had a bad smell, left by the previous owners. Cleaning it did not seem to help. Leather is the perfect material for a steering wheel and this one is very high quality. It does not have much of a leather smell though which is could be good or bad. I would rather it had a stronger leather smell.  The inside of this is rubber and looks like a bicycle tire. It is very tough and does not stretch. When i tried to install it, it seemed impossible even though my steeling wheel is the right size. Another reviewer suggested heating it in the dryer and this worked perfectly. It was still a struggle but not impossible.  The extra thickness will take getting used to but the feel of leather is so much nicer than smelly plastic.	1
Fits right into the wheel and looks great!	1
One of the best we have found and they have held up well over the months we have now been using them.  Now own several of them for our vehicles.	1
fit the wheel on my 83 CJ7 perfectly - I put it in the sun for about 15 minutes, then slid it on with little difficulty.  The factory wheel is a fairly thin one covered with vinyl, so adding this cover makes the wheel easier to hold on to - and the thick leather really feels like quality material.  Hopefully it holds up in the sun, but time will tell.	1
I just installed this on my 2004 Silverado with a 15.5 inch steering wheel. I heated it in a 150 degree oven for about 5 minutes prior to installation. It took a little time to work it on but it looks good and appears to be a quality product. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the seams are a little bulky causing it to bulge out a little but most people probably wouldn't even notice. It really dressed up the steering wheel and covered the original leather nicely that had become damaged after 10 years of use. After two years of use it looks and fits like new.	1
did not fit my nissan xterra 02	-1
Quite well made for $20 with real leather, a good improvement for my old Chevy pickup. As previously mentioned, putting in clothes dryer for about 10 minutes makes it easier to install.  Installation requires some force, but when warmed up as mentioned, it is more flexible, but will firm up on the wheel when it cools down.	1
My '04 Mercedes C320 has an original leather wrapped steering wheel. However, I put on of these on the keep the wear to a minimum as it was starting to show on the OEM wheel. I also use these on my '04 Chevy Silverado pickup wheel and my '01 Corvette. I like the additional padding and softness of the leather as I have bad hands and these make the wheels more comfortable. I highly recommend this Pilot SW-101 leather cover. DO NOT get the Pilot vinyl/plastic version. They stink to high heaven and won't stretch to fit. I tore one trying to put it on the wife's Dodge minivan with my son helping me. It didn't tear at the seam either.	1
One size doesn't fit all - My Jeep has a thicker than usual steering wheel, and it was impossible to get this cover on it. It was not an inexpensive item either. (Note - I did find a cover that fits nicely, cheaper and eve locally).	-1
just not what I wanted.... returned	-1
I have a 2001 Jeep grand cherokee and it took a while to get it on but it fits great and looks great.	1
The cover fits perfectly on my 2014 BMW 5 Series.  I love the quality too; it feels like genuine leather!	1
as expected	1
Good quality,just a hair too small for Chevy Malibu wheel,tore during installation.	-1
Nice fir and finish.	1
Very comfortable , but hot in summer and cold in winter anyway.	1
My car is 10 years old and the steering wheel was worn slick with use.  This cover has a nice leather feel.  Although a little bit of a challenge to put on, the result is a snug fit that doesn't slip.  The edges not wrapping around entirely give it a slightly wider feel than I am used to, but not uncomfortably so.  It also looks nice - overall a good solution to keep my aging car comfortable and looking nice.	1
Had this about a year now. Still love it. Make sure to condition the leather from sun damage.	1
I like.	1
great quality, easy to install.  will not fit a smaller wheel.	1
covered up worn steering wheel and doesn't look tacky. Doesn't slide around either.  all in all very satisfied, not one complaint	1
This is a great product. I uploaded images on the product a while back for you guys to see. I had a 2010 Base Toyota Rav4 and now I have a 2014 XLE Toyota Rav4. The cover fits PERFECTLY on my 2014 car. The cover feels loose BUT isn't on my 2010 car so it fits just fine.  When I first used the cover on my 2010 car and got my new car, I took the cover off and put it on my 2014 car. The cover was fine, then I decided to take it off again and just buy a new one for my new car. When placing the cover back on my 2010 car, I noticed it was VERY loose. So just be warned not to take it off and on to place it on another vehicle, you might make it loose if kept on too long.  This is also very good for driving long periods of time. The wheel feels thick and a little cushion like, but sturdy so it's great to have on.	1
This cover is a little bulky on the steering wheel. Fits nice and works great but I would have chosen a thinner cover if I knew. Other than that, I am happy with this cover.	1
great product with excellent quality, use it on my truck to protect the steering wheel, I've and it for some time now and it still looks brand new...	1
I have looked all over for a steering wheel cover that doesn't have rhinestones, NASCAR logos, or other distractions on it.  I just wanted a simple black lether cover, and that is what I got.  No frills, no bells and whistles, just a great steering wheel cover.  It's all leather, and is supposed to improve with age and handling.  It takes some elbow grease to get the cover over the wheel, but with the extremely tight fit there is no slippage of the cover on the wheel.  This was just what I wanted and I highly recommend it to anyone who does not want a steering wheel cover that flashes or conveys a message.	1
We love this cover! Went on easily, no raunchy leather smell, no slippage and has shown to be durable after a year of use. Totally worth it!	1
I like these leather steering wheel covers more than the ultra-expensive leather OEM steering wheels available on the market.  The feel is great. The grip is great and the cover is at its best comfort levels in extremely hot or cold weather.	1
It's not a steering wheel cover which I'd prefer personally. It provided no extra grip, it was more of a distraction and annoyance when driving.	-1
Shifts and slips a little.  Not perfectly at the same place after time.  I centered it where I wanted, but I can tell it shifts positions over time.  One month ownership thus far.  OK product otherwise, but still can't tell if its real leather. Does't have that smell.	1
I bought this product to replace the laced type cover that was okay but didn't look good and the lacing was annoying. I was pleased with the looks of Pilot cover and at the same time taken back by the lack of instructions to install it. Even a quick note saying THANK YOU for the PURCHASE and good luck would of been better than nothing.  Installation wasn't that bad, but taking your time and go slow is the key. I found that after I got the bottom 1/4 of the cover on the whee,l a few tyraps helped in holding it in palce while I worked each side over the wheel. I used a hair dryer to help the leather be a little more understanding to me stretching it over the wheel. Every couple of inches another tyrap and after 10 minutes DA DA All done!!	1
if you're looking for a steering wheel cover, then check with Amazon consumer reviews first. Don't waste your money at the auto parts store. This is absolutely a great steering wheel cover.	1
I've had a lot of imitation leatherish wheel covers that a) smell and b) don't last very long.  I can't swear that this is real leather or not, but it doesn't stink like others that I've had, and so far, in about the 4 months I've had it, it's holding up well.  So far so good.	1
Very nice leather steering wheel cover and it feels nice too easy to install. this is my second Pilot leather steering wheel cover and it's much nicer than the last one.	1
Nice feel and texture on the steering wheel now.  Price is right and it came on time.  Can't really say it gives a genuine leather feel but for the money it is not bad.	1
I bought this for a vehicle that was given to me that really needed some TLC.  The steering wheel was so disgusting that I still didn't even want to touch it after not only cleaning it, but sanitizing it as well.  I wasn't expecting much when I ordered the cover but I was still impressed.  It is of a decent quality leather for the price, and it has nice padding underneath of it so it is comfortable to grip.  I'll knock off a star for the quality of the stitching and how much girth it adds to the steering wheel.  The vehicle it is installed on is a Mazda, and Mazda's come with really nice, thick wheels but with this added it is very thick.  Pros: Quality leather Comfortably padded Feels great in your hand  Cons: Adds a significant amount of thickness Stitching not top notch Some of the seams are crooked  Bottom line?  This is MUCH better than the crap plastic or vinyl covers you will buy for only a few dollars more.  Well worth the price!	1
i used these to replace the emblems on my truck wheels. the adhesive is very sticky. they are very flexible. i question if they will make it thru a northern IL winter though. i guess we will see.	1
I got this steering wheel cover on time and in perfect condition. I see that some people say it was hard to put on, and I suppose it was... being a 200lb 20yr old guy, I didn't have to much trouble. Once it was on, my goodness! it is BY FAR the best steering wheel cover I have ever had! If you are looking for one, get this one, and you will not be sorry!	1
Premium leather construction with the perfect fit for my car. The basic black model blends well into my dark gray interior. Installed in seconds without any tools and stays exactly where I placed it. No movement, no play, no break-in time needed! I should have bought this the day I took possession of the car! I especially like the over-sized feel as too many of today's steering wheels are thin and plain.	1
The quality of the product is great, it's a licensed GM product.  Fast delivery. I live in a foreign country, it seems to me that they are a little expensive, buth worth the purchase.	1
Not happy with the feel of my leather-wrapped steering wheel, diameter too thin in my hands...This sleek, smooth black leather cover slid on just right, didn't have to throw it in the dryer to warm it or anything. Looks great and is nicer than the stuff available at Auto Zone. Great buy, looks very durable, go for it!	1
Great cover! I put it on in minutes after delivery and warming a little, and it is not moving; low 80's outside today but likely over 110F in the car. I do not have sweaty hands and it does not look like color came off. It is smooth leather and is dyed black, much like belts and shoes, which can rub off on contact (belts do after repeated hand-contact and probably stain the inside of belt loops without our knowing). For those with sweaty hands get a rubber-cover with grips (stinky) or vinyl (slippery) but neither are very durable in hot cars; you won't be as happy with the comfort unless it is leather. Non-leather will smell toxic or be slippery, but it will not bleed color. If your hands sweat they may slip on vinyl or smooth rubber. This product has a great grip and feel and leathery smell.  There is an inner rubber-sleeve )non-smelly) that prevents the cover from moving. I set the product in the sun for about 5 minutes and it made it ply-able enough to work it on. I recommend starting with the center-most seam on top of a straight wheel(there are 3 seams at roughly 12,4,8 O'clock), carefully work the outer edge over the wheel and down both sides evenly (the first 3/4's is easy), use patience and care, then roll the edge into position. If it is off-center it cannot be slid sideways. Take it off carefully and begin again with it more centered and work each side evenly; a little here, a little there. Do not put this on cold or stretch without warming; it can damage/crack/tear cold leather.  I placed this on a 15" 2008 Chevy Aveo5 steering wheel (do measure your wheel diameter before ordering). The only con to these types of covers is they cannot wrap the inside, so the fingers feel the outer edges of the cover; in this case it is smooth, rolled, and well stitched and I have gotten used to it. It is probably made in China at this price but it looks and feels like good quality. I recommend this and would choose to buy again and recommend to a friend. I also recommend a little leather conditioner on this, much like one would use on leather car interiors. It is smooth leather, not suade or roughened.  In 'the old days' I bought wrapped 'stinky' vinyl, and used vinyl to thread through holes and wrap around the cover with tension (still available) and it filled the inner part of the wheel. It was difficult and time-consuming, and, the vinyl strings eventually breaks. I recommend this 'new and improved' version. Rubber and vinyl degrades in heat and UV. Did you know that wonderful 'new car smell' is highly carcinogenic, expecially when hot, and all the glue they use on carpeting and interior fabric, also. This has been well known and accepted for over 50 years but it sells cars. FYI.	1
Very nice.  Look good on my Ford Think.  Adhesive is very strong.	1
Good	1
I have used these before on rear mud guards and they stay put.  Easy to install, Love them.	1
nice touch for my truck	1
This is a very nice emblem.	1
For what these are -- stick-on emblems -- they are superb. They have a thick, rich, clear top-coat that makes them look like a heavy glass or plastic emblem. But they are a supple, conformal plastic that easily fits to flat or curved surfaces. The adhesive is super-tacky and looks like it will stick great and last a long time.  I only needed one, so even if it only lasts a couple of years, I have another to replace it with. Not bad for seven bucks.	1
20 minutes in the dryer on low softened it up for easier stretching over the wheel on our 2002 Chevy Tahoe.  Smells like new leather seats which I like but some do not.  Nice soft feel.  Quality piece.  Seller was fast and efficient as well...	1
As other reviewers have mentioned, I wasn't quite sure this was going to be big enough to fit over the steering wheel in my Jeep Liberty, but with little effort it went on and fits snugly and looks professional. It easily rivals the more expensive automotive store brands in both appearance and comfort.	1
After four years my other one became sticky, most likely form all the windex I used to clean it with...don't use windex on leather. I cut the old one open to see what it was made of. It is thick leather, real leather. I bought two more so I will have one in case they quit making these. Worth every cent. Buy it. Fits on 2004 GMC Sierra 1500.	1
Although it fit my 14.5" diameter steering wheel, the quality and fit is awful. I wouldn't even put this on my steering wheel if it was free.	-1
Had placed two of these on my Chevy three years ago and just recently replaced it.  The fit to the window was still good, the only reason for changing was some slight fading from the direct sunlight.  Even still, this product bright redness lasts for an easy couple of years.  For application, highly recommend following to a "T" on the instructions as it will be easy for you to perfect the alignment.	1
The decal is sharp and easy to install . Came in a new package its bright red Chevy bow tie is raised and looks great, This is the second package of these bow tie decals I have purchased. I installed them on my 1966 Chevy Impala to give it a little class.	1
These are really cool domed urethane self sticking decals. Great on the body, mud flaps or grill or tailgate on your car or truck. Goes on easily and appear to stay on even after several runs through the car wash.  There is one problem however! I ordered 3 sets and used them, found a way to use more but Amazon (or somebody) will not sell me anymore. When I asked they said these are so popular that they limit how many you can purchase. They told me that for the remainder of my life on my current Amazon account I will never be able to purchase this product again. They want everyone to have the opportunity to procure these hot items.  I don't know what the limit is but got the impression that it is one order, so order all you think you will need , ever need or anticipate ever needing. They are absolutely inflexible with this limit, I did not see any limitations when I purchased these items, that would have been helpful.  Bottom line, nice product but there is a limited quantity per account.

Although they look great and are well made I did not realize how big they are, way too big fit my hhr, these are made for a large pickup truck, gave them away	-1
Work great and look nice.	1
Looks good and the red bowtie matches my silverado..I'll be buying 2 more sometime..	1
good flaps , looks and keeps dirt off the side of my truck better	1
This fit my steering wheel perfectly, and it only took about two minutes to install.  It does add some bulk to the steering wheel, but the padding makes it very comfy for your hands.  It also does not have the horrible smell that other covers sometimes have.  I would definitely purchase this again.	1
It looks good, feels good and has a leather odour.  I love this wheel cover which is made of thick leather.	1
delivered on time, looks pretty good on the truck	1
good	1
Second set bought, as hubby got a newer truck & wanted them put back on.	1
I put these on the black trim in the back of my Chevy (Red) Spark to jazz it up. I love them. They look standard on mine, just like they were factory issued. They are the absolute best!	1
nice decals look great	1
They were to small for my 96 impala but there very nice decals I'll keep looking for a big er size	-1
I know it's an old car but the steering wheel feels like a race car now. Just kidding. Snug fit and a bit hard to line up the seam where I wanted it but that's how it stays put. I'm happy with it.	1
i ordered smaller ones for the front of my 3/4 ton truck and wouldn't do that again.  I am very happy with these on the back and they look great.	1
bought a new truck and these are better than any stock item available, and they look great.  5 stars for thick rubber construction and length.	1
I bought these for my Chevy Silverado 01. They were very easy to install and look very nice on the truck!	1
I love the design on them and they are a good quality product. I couldn't buy specially molded mud guards for my truck because of the wide fender flares but these work great. My tires pick up alot of rocks and that cut my problem down more than half.	1
This is a must buy if you are looking for as steering wheel cover. STAY AWAY form the plastic ones, they NEVER stop smelling!!  The real leather ones are hard to find in the auto stores for some reason, but easy to find here on Amazon	1
I am still debating whether I should make the effort to install a laced cover, which would be preferable. It is a good cover, eminently satisfactory and an improvement over the naked wheel.	1
didn't fit any of our cars (accord, prius, volvo).  very thick so imagine even if it fit it's feel too bulky	-1
The item was just as discribed. Genuine Leather, it does fit sung. My wheel is a PT Crusier GT. It is leather, but it's starting to show wear. So I bought this to try? It was a bit hard to put on. So I laid it in the Sun for awhile. It went on. But don't add anything to help it along. You don't want it to slip. My Steering Wheel is 15", but it fits like it was made for it! My secret for keeping them looking HOT, is KIWI Black shoe polish, hand rubbed. SW	1
awesome  ,thank you	1
really like these. heavy duty.	1
Fit well, look nice!	1
These mud guards I bought for my husband  Chevy truck.  He put them on and they look great. The price was great also.	1
they arrived prior 2 original date and are very good quality and sturdy-amazingly easy 2 install with the self threading screws-did have 2 remove rear wheels but installed quickly-very much worth the money-go with the 11 inch 4 trucks covers a larger area-	1
This is a nice steering wheel cover.  I'm not completely sure its leather but it feels nice.  I read reviews where buyers are one starring this product saying its plastic and one even said he cut a chunk out for his to see if it was leather.  I'm going to say this.  If you want something that smells like top grain Italian leather this is not the product nor the price range you need to be looking for and it definitely isn't the expectation you should have if you paid less than $20 for a product.  For that price you get what you get,  regardless of what the manufacturer may claim. Reviewers on Amazon kill me with unrealistic expectations like products that are purchased at low costs like this one should be perfect and expensive grain leather is unrealistic and ignorant.  A nice cover it is.  Top grain leather it is not, at least not for $20. Want top quality?  Spend multiples of the cost of this product! !!! I like mine and itinstalled in a snap.	1
I read other reviews on this wheel cover and several stated it was OK but not real/genuine leather and falsely advertised.  I agree with those assessments.  It is NOT real leather, but it serves the purpose, is more than adequate and very reasonably priced.  It fits snugly on my Mazda MPV, where other wheel covers have been too loose.  It's a very nice product and I would buy another one - but it's not real leather.	1
I like it... I'm got it as a gift for my wife, and in spite of it being good quality, well made, good leather, etc., she's not loving it.  On the steering wheel, the reinforced edges plus the thickness of the leather itself make the steering wheel overall quite thick.  It's fine for me, but too thick for my wife.  The reinforced edges (front and back) also are just a bit too thick, I think.  It's a byproduct of how well built it is.  The edges appear very strong and will probably last years, but it if they could have made the edges just a bit less bulky feeling, it would feel better in your hands.  I put it in my car even though my car's interior is gray and I bought the black one.  Makes my car smell nice!  4 stars, which is still a good rating.	1
Agree with the previous reviews, very comfortable wheel cover to hold and doesn't feel cheap at all.  Would recommend it to anyone.	1
Simple, quick review. Real, thick, stiff leather. Heat it up some to make install easier. Good color! Feels great, works well!	1
I got it for my black 2011 Honda Pilot EX (without the factory leather package -- just the EX not the EX-L model) with gray interior and it fits snugly and matches the interior just fine being black. I've had it on for almost a year now and I really like it. Got another one for my wife's 2007 Pilot LX but had to return it. It fit fine, but the texture was different. Mine is smooth and shiny. The other one that came felt sticky to my hands - like somewhat wet oiled suede. *I* didn't like that feeling, but *you* may like. Just FYI that they are not all exactly the same apparently.	1
This steering wheel cover is exactly what I was looking for.  Soft leather, and is very durable, and the stitching is very high quality.  I love the way this makes my interior look and the feeling is great.	1
I purchased this leather steering wheel cover for my 2003 Toyota Celica GT and love it. Then after acquiring my 2000 Dodge Ram 1500 pickup if it would fit.  According to Amazon it will not fit pickups, so I measured both steering wheels and indeed the American pickup has a slightly larger steering wheel than my Japanese sports car. But I went ahead and tried it anyway, I took it off my Celica and after a lot of hard stretching, ACTUALLY GOT IT ON MY RAM PICKUP STEERING WHEEL!!  It is a much tighter fit than the Toyota and most people will not have the skill or strength to put it on but remember mine was used in my Celica for almost a year so it was a little worn. I ordered a new one for my Celica and am keeping the older one on my RAM.  Would a new cover fit any pickup? I do not know the answer to that question, but a used one fit mine and I get to love this steering wheel cover in both my vehicles now so I am very pleased.	1
I didn't have any problems installing this. Just start on one side and stretch it over the rest. Took one day to get used to the thickness on the wheel but it works very well.	1
Fast shipping as always via Amazon Prime. This steering wheel cover advertises it to be "Genuine Leather". I think that's a bit of an over statement. The one I received seemed like it was made from half leather and then half "pleather". The construction was very good and it seemed to be well made, but the quality of the leather used leaves a bit to be desired. The fit was perfect and if they had used a better quality of leather, I would have gave it a 5 star rating.	-1
After my car's steering wheel leather started to take a turn for the worst, I needed a product to replace/cover the unsightly wheel. At first I thought about replacing the entire wheel but then started adding up all the cost associated with that process. This is an affordable solution. The leather cover is a perfect fit for my vehicle. It takes just a little effort to get it on (not too much effort but I wanted it to be aligned properly). It has an amazing fit and feel in your hands.  I highly recommend this. So much so that I'll probably keep this item in my wishlist for when the other two cars steering wheels start to show wear and tear.	1
This cover is very nice - not cheap feeling at all. I tried a soft cover first - I found the the soft material felt nice but, didn't have enough friction for a solid grip. This cover is great - feels great and plenty of friction for a good solid grip. As others have stated it doesn't fully wrap around the steering wheel but, I knew that going into it.  Very nice steering wheel cover - someone also mentioned how to install it and the advice helped me - it installs very easily - if you just get it started somewhere and keep pushing it into place as you go around the wheel. Don't try to put one edge on, then the opposite and force/stretch it - that's a waste of energy.	1
Appears to be very high quality leather. Very soft and feels great on the hands when driving. I almost didn't buy this one as I can get one for under $10 at a store like Walmart. I hate Walmart though and love Amazon. Also reviews made me think this would last longer than the last one I bought at Walmart about two years ago that was hanging by the treads on the vehicle I just sold. My hands sweat a lot when driving which is why I have to have a cover as my first leather steering wheel on a '94 Audi I ruin. Now I use covers all the time and this is the best I have owned out of the four I have used over the past eight years. The only possible thing that could be wrong with this unit would be if it doesn't last as long as it appears it would, but that will take time to tell. Highly recommend buying this, I got it for around $18 with free shipping. Five stars for initial quality and a price.	1
I bought these after a cheaper Highland set made of stiffer material started tearing at the screw line. These are relatively pliable rubber and the perfect width for my 18" 245/40 tires. The manufacturer thoughtfully included at least eight self-tapping screws. If you're mounting them with a drop of more than 3", consider adding washers to reduce strain on material near the screw heads.  The flaps are holding up well and haven't faded like the previous installation. I did have to pull my wheels off to install them. A tip: if your lug nuts are recessed and you're using a standard lug wrench, wrap a shop towel near the end so you won't scrape paint off your wheels when the wrench goes off-center with pressure.  For the effort involved in installing this sort of accessory, there's no point opting for anything cheaper. These are an excellent choice.	1
I was a bit concerned about installation after reading some reviews.  I have a 2012 Kia Sportage LX with a 14.5 inch diameter steering wheel and this leather cover installed easily and fits well.  2/5/2012 We have been on a couple of longer drives with the new steering wheel cover and it is a definite improvement over the textured steering wheel.  There are 3 seams on the cover and I placed one at the top enter of the wheel leaving the other two a third of the way around.  I drive with my left elbow on the armrest and my left had on the wheel and that ends up right at the seam on that side.  I'll move it next time I think about it and it will be easy on the 14.5 inch steering wheel.  If the cover is on a 15 inch steering wheel and more difficult to remove and replace you may want to think about your normal had position on the wheel prior to installing the cover.	1
Before I buy anything I look at the reviews I weigh the good and bad. This had alot of reviews and people were loving the feel. A few comments about bulky came up...  This is how I felt. I got this in the mail I left it on the mock steering wheel it came on becase I heard of other people saying it was hard to stay on.  A few days  later I was able to put it on very easy. Took seconds to do.  I am a new driver and I thought this might distract me while driving, but I couldn't take the feel of the slim steering wheel. This product was the best ever. The feel and look is amazing esp at the price given.  It made driving easier and control of the car was mch better. I felt I had a better grip.  This is the one :) God Bless!	1
Exactly what I was looking for.  Driving an older chevy cavilier and the steering wheel was starting to fall apart.  So i found this to be the perfect way to fix that problem. Feels great and soft in your hands, even in the cold of winter (its 10 degrees outside right now!)	1
This one is much better than what you can get from the local stores, if you are looking for genuine leather.  The tactile sensation is great.  I have it on my 07 Toyota RAV4.  It transformed the hard plastic steering wheel to a "joy" to the hands when driving.  It feels like my previous Volvo with a factory leather steering wheel. The installation is very easy, I did not have to put in a lot of effort, probably has to do with the type of steering wheel.  It does add a little bulkiness, but it works for me.  A person with small hands may be more noticeable.  I looked at products like those you have to lace up yourself, the high end ones, costs more than $50.  For the price and ease of installation, this is a great product.	1
I really like this steering wheel cover, it has given my MK4 VW Golf a better feel. The only bad thing is that my steering wheel is smaller. Once in place the cover was very loose so I had to stitch it all around to make the cover more firm. Now my steering wheel has a factory leather-look. So for the owners of golfs mk4 out there... be aware of that.	1
These don't have the rubber nubs on the bottom to hold the mat down do it slides when people move their feet.  I used these in the back seat of my '14 GC.  They look good but has no functionality.	-1
Great Mats I Bought Two and put them in the Rear of my 2 Door XJ  The fit and function is Great! The Mats are Rugged looking and have  Very bold raised Letters The set i received where Official Mopar From Plasticolor and Made in USA!	1
Perfect	1
ok	1
It works fine. It includes mounting screws too.	1
This is a great pair of mud guards from Plasticolor! They aren't the flimsy mudguards I have had before. They are very thick and look great on my truck. They do not come pre-drilled so you will need to make your own holes in them but that is very easy to do. They fit my 2014 Silverado perfectly and I couldn't be happier! I was not provided a discount or sample of the product for my honest unbiased review. I test each and every product I review. Good or bad, my opinions are from my own experiences with the product and may not always be the same as another person however they are never influenced in any way.	1
Not too difficult to install.  Rubber appears to be reinforced with glass(?) fibers.  Survived 70-80MPH drives, so far.	1
Used on the rear wheels of my '99 Tahoe. They are a bit small but it does the job. After all, i'm not trying to look like those compensating truck owners with mudflaps the size of a sleeping bag that flaps around in the wind.	1
They fit nicely on my pickup truck	1
Excellent price and quality!!!($7.44 shipped) I was not expecting such a quality made product for what I paid! Ordering 2 - 3 more today. They would make great floor mats. flat tire knee pads, tool box mats, small welcome mats, bathroom mats etc. Get a couple, you'll be glad you did!	1
These mats fit perfect in the rear of my, 2006 Jeep Wrangler Sport. They match the rest of my mats, they work great and look good too, at an excellent price you can't beat.	1
Fits perfectly in my jeep wrangler 4 door. Nice bright jeep logo just adds a little accent. Nice rugged rubber and is heavy enough to stay in play quite well.	1
I just got one for my 2001 Chevy Suburban and one for my 2006 Ford Five hundred. These covers fit well. They don't slide and they are made of real leather. You can smell the leather scent. One imprtant note is that as a result of these covers being made well and of a thick leather, they do make the driving experience slightly different. They do make the steering wheel thicker. No regrets, the steering wheels on my cars were in poor condition. The alternative would have been to purchace new steering wheels.	1
Just like the title says:  It fits and it looks good.  The leather looks good and dark, not like the previous cover I bought that looked faded and it was near impossible to install (I gave the other a bad review).	1
Soft, pleasant to the touch, nice leather, quality stitching, seems odorless.  I have large hands and this cover provides a half-round grip that I find very comfortable.  Slides onto the wheel easily.  It does not lace into place, but unlike slick plastic covers it shows no signs of wanting to slip. There are three seams and the bumps are a very slight annoyance, though it's easy enough to position the cover so that when driving straight the seams are away from my hands.  I'm quite pleased with this.	1
They are perfect for my 2015 Silverado 4X4, and they were easy to install - back wheels took a little more time.	1
Even though the floor of the backseat is a pretty discrete place that doesn't need much improvement, these mats really add a cool factor for anyone that finds themselves back there.  They are also good as general purpose mats for kitchen, garage, and anywhere else that needs some Jeep branded love.	1
great price great item. iam going to buy another soon. the pruduct is very well made of a 1/8th inch thick flexible rubber.	1
i got this mat to place in the back for my 2007 jeep wrangler....it looks good and stays flat.....not real thick rubber but its good enough for what i need it for. will buy more of these in the future...	1
This is a guy's dream mat for either gun cleaning or the more innocent guy's stuff at day's end when a working man empties his stuff on that table or desk or bureau or dresser.  Now just dump all your keys, phones, wallets, knives, glasses etc on this welcoming mat.  I use it for pistol cleaning every month-- dual use in the Duffy House.  I drive and love a 2010 Jeep Commander, so that is why I rocked this impulse buy last pay day.	1
Good product, it is a little different than expected with pretty much everything being made out of silicone, however good product	1
Made by PlastiColor, this fairly thick, highly pliable mat seems to be of decent quality.  The "Jeep" lettering is white rubber that seems to be colored deep into the surface.  It appears to be the size of an automotive rear seat floor matt, but I'm using it as a protective surface for hobby work.  This one was made in the USA, which is always a welcome attribute.  Dec-16-2012 Update:  After continued use as a soft work surface, it is till holding up great!	1
This was great! I thought it was a solid sticker at first, so I messed up the application a little. I put it on the back of my helmet though, and it makes wearing a full-face helmet on a harley a little less embarassing.	1
This is a great little vinyl graphic.  You do have to be careful when removing the carrier/backer sheet before install because each letter is it's own separate piece.  I added this to my mailbox and clear coated it in, looks great and should last a long time.	1
Looks good so far. We will see how long it lasts. A little difficult to apply since it tends to stick to the sheet that needs to be removed. Use a sharp point to help it along.	1
They shipped fast so receiving them quick was a plus. But the screws are cheaply made and didn't stay screwed in my car. Also they bend permanently after some time depending on how low you install them. I ended up just taking them off by hand since the screws are crap. They looked nice while they were on though	1
For  a pair of $12 mud flaps I could not be happier! I live down a 1/2 mile dirt road and the sand, rocks and mud really gets everywhere on a daily basis. These were installed on the front of my 07 suburban and effectively block 98% of the debris that used to coat my vehicle. With the rear bumper being higher than the front I will be looking for a longer set to install out back, but 9" was just perfect for the front. Note, I had originally bought these for my 2013 Wrangler Rubicon but were entirely too short due to its increased ride height versus the suburban.	1
Perfect fot my 2004 Tacoma	1
LOOKS REALLY NICE ON OUR DODGE RAM	1
Easy installation.	1
LOVE the feel of the leather. Way better than the cover I bought at a local auto parts store. I recommended it to my dad.	1
It makes the extremely comfortable.  The leather is good quality, soft, adds a lot of bulk, but, again, so comfortable!	1
Looks and works as described, if not significantly better. Yes, it does increase the usable thickness of the steering wheel once you slip this on, but I like this effect as grasping a thick wheel is more comfortable to me than is grabbing a thinner one. Got rid of my older synthetic one and also got rid of the smell---this one is virtually odorless even brand new. Wonderfully simple and clean design. Can't say enough about how this inexpensive accessory upgrades the look &  of my vehicle interior.	1
The cover arrived a few days earlier than scheduled so that was a bonus. Like the other reviews, I have to agree on most points: good quality look and feel, a little difficult to install but you do end up with a good snug fit, and it feels like you are steering with a kielbasa but it doesn't bother me at all.	1
Very good	1
Product came looking USED. Footprints already on it, dusty. Very disappointed.	-1
I bought a Kool Vue mirror for the drivers side on my jeep and it is the worse ever. It shakes so bad that it is nearly useless. I ordered 2 more, one to replace the Kool Vue and this time I went with the Crash Parts. How disappointing to see them arrive in a Kool Vue box. I haven't installed them yet but they will be going back if they shake. Why advertise as Crash Parts if they are Kool Vue? Not sure why the floor mat is appearing as the review is for the mirrors	1
It is what it says it is - a nice leather steering wheel cover.  It feels good and smells like leather instead of chemicals.	1
worked well on my jeep	1
Does not fit 2004 Toyota Tacoma. It's not even close. A lot of cutting is needed and then it does not cover that much area. They're actually not wide enough to cover the spray from entire tire width. Try to find used OEM pair.	-1
Very clean and simple design. Installs easily with a drill. It helps to have a friend hold and line them up with you. Once I got them to where I wanted it on one side, I put two screws in the top, measured the height, did the same on the other side, and then jacked up the truck and removed the tires so I could install the last two screws. Did the same for the front. Happy with the results.	1
Made of tough stuff, should last a long time	-1
Looks Great in my Silverado!!	1
item is as expected, and does work great.	1
These look great. Comes 2 flaps in a pack so I bought 2 of them. Looks great on my Lancer.theyre easy to drill thru and comes with screws. Pretty awesome buy	1
These are pretty okay, used them to replace the stock mudflaps on a Volvo wagon. While they are durable material, they are a little floppy and while mounting was straight forward, don't look quite at home on the vehicle.  Width is good, and I have noticed the car is much cleaner after trips down dirt roads and though rain. Would recommend.	1
Ordered for Pontiac grand Prix. Way to big. Tried cutting them down but left ragged edges. Probably would be good for a larger vehicle like a van or truck.	-1
Great color scheme and can cut for a custom fit. Easy to clean off loose debris. The only downside is that the white checkered area can easily get dirty and is not easy to clean off.	1
nice mats great colors put them in at car shows would buy again	1
just what i needed	1
I like the construction of themand logo & colors	1
Luv these mats bought them back in 2008 when my truck was brand new and they show no signs of wear and tear...great durable product!!!	1
Looks good in my truck.	1
Great	1
Nice	1
Easy to put on and looks great on my back window, just the right size.	1
Adhesive does not hold very well. I had stuck mine on a stainless steel Yeti-style mug and it started peeling off the next day. I might work better on a flat glass window.	-1
Love the decal but it is very hard to apply. Hard to separate and the decal sticks to the cover.	-1
Perfect size decal+real easy to apply. A++++	1
They left the store tag on and it was cheaper than the price I paid	1
perfectly cut vinyl.	1
This was a backup keychain for my brushed nickel John Deere key chain. It is plastic and not a flashy but does the job.	1
I bought this for i believe over 5 dollars i am a deere fan but this was a complete waste of money wasn't gonna send it back it would have cost more then i paid for and the real kicker is i found a bunch local in a hardware store for a buck50 each From my experience the company plasticolor makes many diferent products and not a one that ive seen or used was worth the selling price what ever they make is certainly out there and available from different manufactuers and would not purchase another product from plasticolor	-1
This was a great replacement key chain for the original that broke.  The shipper sent this as promised and it works very well when I'm trying to find the right key for the right mower, atv, etc.	1
Good coloring, durable plastic and shipped free using Super Saver!  Needed something to put my John Deere tractor key on....stands out in my key cabinet!	1
Looks great on the truck.	1
Looks good, seems like decent quality... time will tell	1
Exactly what I wanted	1
Um...It's a decal	1
Good product, adheres well and great size for a Colorado back window.	1
Awesome fit my 1992 Camaro wonderfully and really pop well with my Red/Black interior!	1
Vivid colors and design, pops. Cheap but doesn't look it.	1
excellent	1
put on the middle of the rear window of my truck and looks great...hardly notice it while driving unless I focus my eyes on it.	1
look good on my truck.	1
Perfect	1
Looks great in the car window. Perfect size!	1
Love it!	1
Just what I wanted for my JD equipment.	1
great piece and price	1
as advertised.recvd quickly.	1
nice	1
very nice	1
I bought a couple of these to keep track of my tractor keys and spare.	1
Was just what I wanted. Good product	1
Item as described	1
Very nice and sting material I love it	1
It's a good quality keychain. The paint is even and hasn't chipped or scratched with the swinging of the lawnmower.  My husband bought this for his little lawn mower.  The man was raised in the suburbs and has never seen a farm in his life. Now that he has a John Deere Lawnmower and a matching keychain, he is trying to farm the backyard. He was looking at larger John Deere tractors the other day.  I think the keychain is causing him to take up a farming habit.	1
Good quality	1
Nice	1
Works as expected to easily identify keys.	1
As described	1
Pros; A very nice looking decal...... For about 2 months. Cons; being that it's so intricate, the sharp corners are already starting to peel off of the window. Which is the beginning of the end of decals. Like I said, it looked nice for a couple of months. A waste of time and money.	-1
well, it's a decal...so it's hard to say a ton.  It's white, shows up will on my tinted window, and proudly proclaims the brand of bike I like the  most.  It seems like good quality vinyl and should last many years on my Jeep Wrangler window.	1
Nice decal sticks great	1
The D is a different size font! Looks very odd.	-1
Holds my new D125 key just fine.	1
Nice product helps me keep track of my key. Well made and attractive.	1
Bought for my new JD lawnmower key. Very nice and I like it.	1
old style be best on an oversized van or pickup kinda gaudy looking on a regs size or style vehicle	1
Put these on my wife's F-250 and it went in great.  the mud guard is thick.  I was worried the logo would be painted or cheap, but it is solid and will not wear down quick.  A very solid and nice mud flap.  You can mount to meet any application.	1
Looks fantastic. Easy to apply. Just what i wanted. Looks great on a tinted window.	1
Very quality, sticks right on and stays there.  Pretty on a tinted window.	1
Great decal	1
A+++	1
Looks like the photo and looks great on my window	1
We love this and the shipping was very fast.	1
The product is just as it appears and described.  Arrived on time and the key ring itself appears to be of good quality.  The little clip is of less quality and I guess they intend you to allow you to use it as a zipper pull, but I intend to use mine as a key ring. The product is a licensed John Deere product so it is not a cheap knock off. Now I can find my John Deere tractor keys among the other keys in my key drawer.	1
Awesome!	1
there r so nice i love them very good	1
Bought two sets of these for two rigs and live in an area with no use of salt in the winter and the shine pitted and fell off even before winter was here and probably before the third wash of the vehicle. Idaho	-1
I put these on my 03 Dakota and they look great. I used 2 of the self tap screws that came with the flaps and had them installed in a short time. They are rigid enough to flop in the wind, but flexible too.	1
A+, Great seller	1
Perfect size with no imperfections!  Very satisfied and the shipping was fast with no delay. Chrome is perfect with no burrs or bubbles!	1
Do not waste you're money....Horrible quality... Some areas on the plate are not even polished... Pew !	-1
I just took this off my Jeep after 12yrs, cleaned it & it looks brand new again & putting it on my new blazer. No problems with the finish & live in Minnesota!	1
Great for the price!	1
fit great and looks  great as well	1
looks great	1
good item	1
Kind of a custom install with these on a 1999 F-250 but a couple strips of 1/8" aircraft aluminum and four metal screws and these bad boys went in and look great!	1
Perfect	1
Besides my old ones being hard to remove these were very easy to install.	1
these fit nice on 2000 F250 4x4 and look sharp. Just put them on front, had oem flaps on back, front ones hit bigger tires so these gave me more clearance.	1
Nice fit .	1
just like the orginal came very fast also.	1
Awesome	1
What can i say there mudflaps	1
smaller than I though but good	1
Factory made quality. Easy to install	1
Too small for a Ram 1500, I returned them.	-1
fits good	1
Small Dont buy it for the truck.  I cant return either past 30Days.	-1
Wish they were a bit longer but they fit well and compliment the truck well. I have a 2004 ram 1500 4x4 with a leveling kit	1
Fit very well and look great.	1
I bought four of these for my new truck and they are easy to install and look good.	1
Look good, little and slight curve due to wind	1
Mudflat , well constructed	1
I had to order this twice. The first set I copied the origional flaps and trimmed the new ones to match. The look just wasn't right. So i ordered a second set and trimmed them freehand to match my truck. They look great!	1
I replaced a shorter set of mud flaps with these for the rear of my Ford F150. Looks like it came from the factory like this. Does a good job of not only keeping the mud off the rear of my truck,but also keeps from slinging mud all over whoever is behind me.	1
Wife bought these for her ride. Product arrived on time as expected. The floor mats have nice deep channels and the logo is crisp white. Highly recommend for all those cow girls out there.	1
bad not for RAM Box 1500 2013	-1
PERFEDT FOR FULL SIZE AND BIG RAMS !	1
Fit great easy to install	1
Looks good and keeps the rocks from hitting my trailers. No more gravel pinging as I drive down the road. Flexible rubber/plastic but stiff enough not to flap going down the highway. I had to remove the rear tires to mount these but not a big deal. Use jack stands please. I do wish they were solid black without the ford label.	1
Great for the price! The Ford logo is molded into the mud flap, not just printed on. It looks very good, like a factory option, on my F250 Super Duty. Installation took about half an hour, but I'm slow. Make sure to get the wide ones for a truck.	1
I put these on the back they look great and fit as expected	1
Too small for a full size truck.	-1
they don't fit my truck	-1
Apparently I didn't so my research on this product.  They look puny on my 2500.  They don't look right, so I removed them.  They are for dakota sized pickups or small trucks.	-1
Looks good and fairly easy to install. Materiel is too thin and flexible. Time will tell how much protection it will provide from mud and rocks. Product dimensions are 19x11x0.25!!!! If it was 0.5" as listed it would be perfect! Also length is 19" not 20" as listed. even 20" would be short for a full size truck (RAM 2500). Hopefully it will be more than decoration until I can install something more permanent. Please fix dimensions on listing!!!!	-1
I have changed my opinion of these. After 10 months, they have warped, deformed and started to crack. Had to buy different ones, and toss these in the garbage. Waste of money!	-1
they don't fit my truck	-1
the gold bowtie is a blazing school bus yellow. Not even close to gold. I read reviews that said it was yellow but I thought it was an exaggeration but it was not.	-1
The 11" is the length and the width is only 9". Too small for a 1500,2500, or3500 to fit right	-1
This is a "one size fits all" type item, but it doesn't fit "all". Says it goes up to 31" tire size, but it doesn't. We have an SUV with tires that fit within the stated size description, but it ripped at the expansion seam while we were attempting to shoehorn it on. Also, I was disappointed with the quality of the fabric. It is a cheaper feel and thickness than ADCO covers and ripped very easily while we were struggling with it. So bag this manufacturer's products and stick with ADCO. Also, I bought it in Sept as Christmas present (I like to start early!), so now I will be screwed for getting any kind of a refund as its outside the 30 day limit.	-1
It looks good at first. But over time, the black and white parts of the mat get really dirty and I could not get the dirt off. The white gets really dingy. I pressure washed them and the discoloration did not change. So the red and white lose their luster and look ugly.	-1
Faded badly after just a couple of months. Definitely NOT the quality I was looking for.	-1
Floor Mats in Picture say ( Dodge ) on the side of them!  The ones i recieved say Ram in the middle of them, i ordered them for Viper not a truck.  Very disappointed  :(  this is the 1st item ive recieved through Amazon that hasn't been as described   Dodge Factory Style Trim-To-Fit Molded Front Floor Mat - Set of 2	-1
It does not fit a standard 16" trailer spare.  It ripped when i tried to install and will be fun to see how much trouble to return.	-1
Nice looking, but small.  Smaller than the standard 2006 Ram floor mats.  Spend more and get something at fits.	-1
YOU  HAVE TO PUT THIS THING ON LIKE A BICYCLE TIRE .  WITH A COUPLE OF SCREWDRIVERS AND ALOT OF STRETCHING.............UPDATE 6 MONTHS LATER .. THE HEAT IN THE SUMMER MADE THIS PRODUCT SHRINK HOW ONE SIDE OF IT  IS ONLY HALFWAY ON THE WHEEL AND THERE IS NO WAY TO FIX IT .	-1
did not like them.	-1
Product design looks nice and appealing. This product seems like made out of plastic bags. It doesn't cover or protect any rain or snow. Save money and buy better made.	-1
the plastic all falls apart after a couple months	-1
It dose not fit my car right	-1
Logo is yellow and not at all similar to illustration. Very flimsy and screams flea market. Save your time and money.	-1
I ordered the Black and Blue chevy keychain, when i got it it was black and Yellow.  its ok. soft rubber. well made. just wrong color.  gave it two stars for good quality but wrong color	-1
Garbage...The steering wheel cover is not smooth at all with the multi layers. As I turn the wheel my hand grazes over a leather flap thats on several ends of this cover.  Don't have a smooth delivery on steering as say an all leather bound cover would. Stay away not worth a 2 layer type cover,get one layer with colors.	-1
Lasts for half a year, sunlight will turn the red into pink and not worth it, unless you keep up your sunlight shade up all the time.  I would not buy it.	-1
These were easy to install but they deform - bend when driving at interstate speeds. If you are looking for a nice looking product, purchase mud guards not mud flaps.	-1
Too small for 98 silverado	-1
Does anyone know  this H.D chrome plate is made of tin, plastic to metal. Thanks for a reply.	-1
I hate to give anything HD only 2 stars but this is going to get it. I guess you get ewhat you pay for since this came with a smudged/scratched logo on the fornt. I am thinking about returning buyt I know that it is going to probably get dinged up anyways being on the front of the truck so I may just live with it. If it came in better Shape I would still only give 4 stars since the logo is only printed on the glass surface.	-1
For a 2002 Chevy Impala they are not a perfect fit, the width is smaller at then the original floor mats.  The writing is on the wrong side where they say "Chevrolet", so the "right" mat you see actually fits better on the drivers side, but the Chevrolet Text is on the right side of the mat when you lay the "right" on on the drivers side and vice versa. In other words it looks stupid. To make "Chevrolet" on the outside like it's supposed to be means you get an even worse fit, the curve is absolutely wrong, it should be the opposite of what you see in the mats...OR...you can write the "Chevrolet" text on the other side and keep the mat shape the same.  They won't don't hold much water, they are ok to put over your original mats. I haven't found a decent priced mat for the impala anywhere that fits. They all either don't fit well or the ones that do are really really expensive.  This is not a bad purchase but it would've been better for $20. By the way they are really thin. They do have grips on the bottom (like teeth) to hold them in place.	-1
So I bought one of these exact same ones last year (nearly exactly according to amazon) and the steering wheel cover is basically a pinkish color by now. The seller clearly states that 'will not fade', while that may be true if you never drive the car, it does fade and you cannot contact the seller nor is there any warranty information on the product....	-1
Looks good and works okay, but 2 of the screws that hold down the top were missing. It upsets me to pay for something and it has missing  parts. If it had been as it should have been, I would have given it 5 stars. I need it now or I would have sent it back.	-1
What a joke calling 3M for instructions for polishing my kitchen counter.  Waste of money.. Bad for my health using it on the kitchen counter.. No Suggestions.  Auto finish department.  Still don't know how to use it.	-1
Happy	-1
I don't know if Chevy has a variety of floors in their pickups, but theses mats DO NOT fit mine. Am going to cut them in the hopes they will look decent until I can get some quality mats. My pickup is the LTZ Z71 extended cab. A definite waste of money....	-1
Didn't work as I expected.  I haven't used a wool cutting pad before and after this experience I don't think I will be using one again.  I has a nice firm velcro backing that attached to my Dual Action Polisher nicely but as soon as I turned it on it flung wood strands all over the place.  It basically covered the car with fuzzy pieces of wool.  So not only did I have to buff of the Compound but the fuzz as well.  Not what I had hoped for.	-1
Didn't work for me. I had a dealer label on the back of my truck that fell off. I tried this product using all the methods described to no avail. I had to use a heat shrink gun to remove the adhesive and that was even a hard job.	-1
What are people talking about?  This doesnt clean leather light color well. I have gray color leather and with a lot of elbow grease, i still see black dirt. I spent over 6 hours rubbing, waiting for the solution to dissolve in heat or cold. Lexol is better. Maybe good for a condition but definitely not to getblack dirt over time. It actually shows blochy spots as well. Not sure how that is possible bc i sprayed that spot over 10 times	-1
Terrible product!!! Do no buy, I had to throw it all away. May I did not know how its meant to be used. But I used some and it was terrible to remove and not much shine...	-1
Using the word "Restorer" is a bit of a stretch.  I'd say it is a decent cleaner but don't expect to transform your vinyl or leather with this product.  If you have light stains or dirt you'll probably have pretty good luck with this product.	-1
Will definitely not remove the double stick tape used to bond factory trim molding to your car. However, works very well for removing bug and tar residue.  If you need to remove trim adhesive, use a rubber disk drill attachment. See my other reviews for the one I like.	-1
Sprayed gobs of this stuff on a rusted gutter.  Gutter still leaked even after multiple applications.  Ended up replacing gutters.	-1
THIS PRODUCT IS NO BETTER THAN UNDERCOATING COSTING HALF AS MUCH.  VERY WATERY AND CHEAP VALVE.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  3M USUALLY HAS VERY GOOD PRODUCTS.  BUT THIS IS BAD.	-1
If you are buying this product for roof repairs save your money. It does not work. I went and bought regular tar repair tube at Home Depot and went over the sealed area again to stop my roof leak.	-1
didn't fit the steering wheel of my john deere riding mower, had to return	-1
was thinking I would get a tool that worked ,not break first time .had to remove master cyl. bench bleed reinstall then finish work ...WILL NOT BUY AGAIN	-1
Although the item is plastic, it has held up well.  It works fine on thinner hoses but does not pinch strong enough for stiffer fuel lines.  I now use a stet of plastic hose pincher's that look like diagonal cutters with a ring that you slide up to secure the clamping.  These work great on any type of house.  Unfortunately, I have not found them on Amazon but did find them at Harbor Freight.	-1
Didn't work worth a darn. I used locking needle nose pliers. They worked like a charm.	-1
1/2" is apparently not meant to include 1/2" ID coolant hose. Won't do it 1) because the wing nuts don't allow enough clamping force 2) because the jaws aren't wide enough to accommodate the hose. Use vise grips and a pair of fender washers.	-1
Very difficult to hand tighten. Have to use pliers to tighten, but then it feels like the plastic body is going to break. Suggest buying something else. I buy a lot of Lisle tools but would not recommend this one.	-1
Pointless.	-1
Too weak and flimsy, avoid them, won't pinch off the brake lines	-1
became vapor locked and would not pump any grease out when squeezing handle upon first time trying to use it. will have to take it apart spilling all of grease and try to fix it myself. by the time I finally got to use it I was past the return date, now I guess I'm stuck with it.	-1
Purchased in 2011. Pumped about 10 tubes of cartridge grease thru the gun and now the follower seal has failed, became stiff,  causing grease to bypass to the rear of the barrel. Repair parts and shipping cost more than a new gun. I expected better quality from Lincoln.	-1
I thought this was a top of the line grease gun. I was wrong it won't prime correctly. It takes more effort to get grease flowing than actually getting the job done.	-1
Nice enough grease gun.  I have used these in the past and expect this one will provide good service too.  I ordered this with some grease and a rack for an ATV.  The grease was included loose in the package and the ATV rack crushed all of the cartridges making them unusable and making a mess of all of the other products ordered.  I was able to clean up the other items with considerable difficulty, but the grease itself was a total loss.  This problem was due to Amazon's packaging.  The outer carton was in perfect shape.  The grease should not have been placed in a package with another heavy, shifting item.  Too say the least, I am very disappointed with Amazon's poor quality packing.  This made for an expensive, messy and frustrating order experience.  Still, the grease gun is a good item, just don't buy it with grease.	-1
Multiple attempts to prime and get this to work, never did and didn't return it in time. JUNK, AVOID	-1
I had problems getting my grease to start pumping out. I tried everything and had no luck. I did like the design with the grip handle where you would be able to pump using one hand. I decided to package it up and send it back. This unit had good reviews but guess I got a defective one. I ordered a different unit that ended up costing more but when I inserted the same grease can that I had in the Lincoln, it worked fine.	-1
NOT CLEAR COAT SAFE if you have areas where the clear coat is worn down a bit.  It strips the clear coat at the spot and surrounding area.  I now have two spots on my vehicle that went from dull to IN NEED OF PROFESSIONAL ATTENTION.  Worst product I ever used.	-1
Hard to apply and very hard to take off.  This will go in the back of the supply cabinet and only be useed when I am out of P21S.  You definitely get what you pay for in this case.	-1
My cheap Home Depot grease gun works much better. This one drips and leaks.	-1
This may or may not be a good product from a usage standpoint, but Amazon and no one else apparently makes it clear that the product is useless without a velcro backing plate that costs another $20.  They even try to sell it as an add on to a polisher without the backing plate!!  If you want to use this pad with your polisher and it does not have a velcro backing plate, you will need to buy one.	-1

hello, noob here, bought a neiko hd 7 inch polisher and a meguiar's w4000 wool pad. upon assembly, i noticed that the wool will not sit properly on the velcro backing plate, so, i measured the diameter of both the wool pad and the polisher.the result is that the pad is 6 5/8" while the backing plate is 7", which explains why it wasn't sitting in flushed with the plate. my question is, do i spread the edge of the wool pad to make it fit to the plate? i've never done this before so i don't wanna destroy the pad. the seller, tcp global is giving me the round around on returning it, so if i can make it work, i 'll call it a day. any input shared is greatly appreciated.as for now, i'm giving it a 1 star review mainly for the seller. as soon as i get to use, i will update and change my review.	-1
Disappointed.  Did not push the grease through bearings, so pretty useless.	-1
Received as a birthday gift from my daughter in October. What a piece of junk! Never worked right. Got it to pump grease once and then it refused to work again. Between this gun and the grease cartridge, my daughter spent almost $50. Taking it to the dump this weekend.	-1
Way to messy and hard to push down. Just as clean to pack them by hand.	-1
Pack the bearings by hand. This thing is a waste.	-1
Over priced and under engineered - the spring loaded plunger is almost impossible to use when filling the gun because the spring is not of uniform diameter and folds onto itself when being compressed.  Metal parts are of sufficient heft but not worth the loading aggravation.  Just noted that others had the same problem as I - the entire gun was totally greasy and almost impossible to hold or handle.  This item is fraught with problems - it should be easy to load and use a grease gun - not this unit.	-1
Final got around to unwrapping this P.O.S. to perform my spring service on my equipment.  When I went to tighten the fitting into the cast casing, it stripped with a very low amount of torque.  So low that if the tube wasn't clean of grease, I would have sworn that I was sold a broken returned item.  Needless to say, because I'd have to pay the prepaid shipping to send it back to the manufacturer for the warranty replacement, I'm better off finding a more durable gun off the shelf.  I take care of my tools and do not abuse them so please don't write this review off to operator error.  Very disappointed given the price I paid for this gun and the term "heavy duty" in the name.  I expected better.	-1
Okay, we all wondered and good old Amazon does not list country of manufacture. The box states made in India. Who knows, found be assembled in India from parts made in China. I don't know. I do know that I put a question out there through Amazons system asking if its made in the USA, I got responses stating yes. Its not.  Now to the product, I will test this weekend. If its crap, its back to Amazon.	-1
Very well constructed but it has a design flaw that makes it useless. The internal plunger has a disc with a slot and the T handle needs to engage the disc perfectly or the rod pushes into the grease and not the disc so the grease does not load properly. I have 4 other standard grease guns and these work perfectly but I wanted the pistol grip so I could pump with one hand.  I have not idea what the intended purpose is in having the rod disengage from the plunger disc as this is unique in my experience to the Lincoln grease gun.	-1
didnt work	-1
This just made a mess.  I've used another kind before but this one just took too much pressure to pack the bearings on my truck.	-1
purchased after extensive research for usa made but had to settle for this p.o.s. the 2 stage pressure does not work so grease comes out in second half of lever travel.since I am a small business owner and don't have time to deal with crap I will probably end up throwing in the garbage if amazon doesn't take it back. watch for my follow up review on amazons cust. service. P.S. my grease gun which I ran over with my dozer works better after 5 minutes with the hydraulic press making the tube round again,MADE IN U.S.A. 30 plus years ago	-1
As another said here it does not work with blue bearing grease. But this is for bearings and bearing grease is a little thicker than general purpose. I do not use general purpose grease for bearings. It ended up being a big mess. I have used the cone ones that did work but I was always able to get a lot more in pressing hard and rolling with a gob of grease in my hand. I then press grease in the back side space. I know it is done right but it is messy too. I keep doing it till no more grease goes in. I am always surprised how much grease I can get in by hand in comparison. This looks like it would work for lighter grease as the reviews stated.	-1
The folks selling the item STILL have not stated it requires a backing plate that costs more than the pad.  It even shows two parts in the picture, making it look like you are getting some kind of backing plate.  It is so ignorant to not state what the item requires and just include a link to it in the listing.  The product may be fantastic, but you should know what you need to buy.  And what is amusing about the comments I have received, is that not one of the folks trolling my review left a review of their own.  Know why?  Because the sellers and manufacturer can't write reviews of their own product.  SHHHHHHHHHH.  Big secret.  -------------------------------  This may or may not be a good product from a usage standpoint, but Amazon and no one else apparently makes it clear that the product is useless without a velcro backing plate that costs another $20.  If you want to use this pad with your polisher and it does not have a velcro backing plate, you will need to buy one.	-1
Amazon lists this item for sale with buffers on the site without telling you either in this listing or in the listings for the buffers that this requires a backing plate you have to purchase separately.  The backing plate costs more than the pads, so be prepared to shell out another $15-$20 to use it, which is a bunch relative to a $60 buffer and a $10 pad.  The pads probably work well, but the extra cost should be listed on the Amazon site to warn people before they buy it thinking it will work with their buffer as is.	-1
Coupler will "click" on to the zerk fitting and not come off, but pump some grease and it gets everywhere except through the zerk fitting. The amount of force required to hold the coupler to the fitting so grease didn't get everywhere makes this gun useless. Sent them an e-mail, a few days (working days) go by and still no response from Lincoln as to what could be the problem. I wouldn't be so upset if I wasn't using Schaeffer's 274 Ultra Superme, but it had to be ordered at $12/tube since I have no local suppliers. Maybe I just got a bad coupler, but I'm not taking any chances on getting another piece of garbage. My HF gun at 1/3 the price and a year old finished the job.	-1
Broken right out of the box. Cheap, too. I returned it bought one at lowe's for $15 that is better.	-1
Left permanent streaks on my black BMW. Had to get entire hood repainted. I've clay barred several times before with Chemical Guys products and thought I'd give this brand a try. Never had this happen with the other brand.	-1
This does the same thing as Meguiars Ultimate Compound, but with the compound you can use a Duel action buffer and with the clay you can not and if you drop it you have to though it away,,,,I used both to see the Difference and it's about the same ,but with the clay you will spend most of your day trying to rub you cars paint by hand,,,,,so I will not recommend this CLAY,,,,use the compound with the machine to put on and you will save time and money,,,and get better results ,,,,,,,,	-1
First of all clay bar is an amazing way to take your auto detailing up a notch. Smooth glass like finish and removes tiny rust dots and road grime.  Kudos to Me guitars for a superior product.  I normally by the kit in a box with the clay bar and a bottle of Quick Detailer for about $12.  I thought this was going to be a tub of clay I could use and I'm really disappointed it's just a much bigger container than necessary with a standard small clay bar inside.  I could easily fit 4 or 5 clay bars in this container.  For this purchase next time I'm goin back to buying the box kit locally.	-1
Maybe its just me, but I didn't see much difference.  I have a 2010 370Z that I baby, and decided after three years it might be time to detail the finish.  As I said, I baby the darn thing so its garage kept and pretty clean to start with.  I followed the long, involved instructions written by one of the experienced reviewers to the letter. I decided to just do the hood, and then clean/wax the rest of the car for comparison. .  I could see some different in the hood.  It was definitely a higher gloss.  But not a difference that any one else would notice.  Maybe it would be more noticeable in an older car with faded paint.  But I wouldn't waste time doing this again.	-1
I learned this the hard way so decided to share my experience in the hopes it'll stop someone else making the same mistake.  I've used several (milder) clay bars in the past from brands such as sonus, mother's, meguiars, zaino, Griot's, and a couple of others. I've found them to vary both in terms of ease of use and speed at which they removed the contaminants.  My assumption with this clay was that being 'Aggressive', it'd remove the bonded contaminants with less elbow-grease than milder claybars. Instead, what I found (and later confirmed by reading online) is that this clay is intended for heavy contamination, and as a precursor to swirl removal.  I was careful to use this clay as directed, and with plenty of spray to keep the surface lubricated. It did a good job of removing contamination, but not noticeably better than other brands I've used. The major downside I found with this clay was that it marred the paint horribly, leaving swirl marks all over the finish which was previously lightly swirled.  If you plan to machine polish the car afterwards anyway, or don't care about swirl marks this is probably a good enough product. For a light to normal amount of surface contamination, I'd strongly recommend you look at something milder.	-1
I used this pad for about one hour each day on two different days about 10 days apart.  I switched from the Cleaner Wax on Day 1 to the Ultimate Compound on Day 2, as the Cleaner Wax was not removing much of the oxidization on my RV.  It appeared that the glue holding the Velcro cloth to the foam pad had melted.	-1
Item not as pictured	-1
I tried this product in a R12 and 134a vehicles, it didn't stop any visible leaks.	-1
Didn't work waste of money SAVE YOUR MONEY! !!! HIGH DOLLAR SNAKE JUICE!	-1
don't need it	-1
no good to me i pecered the can with you kit and it does not fit me car freon line and it just leaked all over i need a new can that will work very very very disopinted	-1
This was more expensive than most of the other products and I had high hopes for it.  Reviews were generally good so thought I would try it. First, after carefully reading directions, tried to add the product but the included hose was very short and hard to get into position and then the coupling wouldn't catch on the low pressure inlet.  It would just hiss and let the rest of the refrigerant leak out.  My other refrigerant hose with gauge always connected in a snap, so it wasn't the car (or me). I should have just returned it after that, but convinced it would work if I could get it into the system, I used my other refill hose, figuring it might affect the pressure gauge, but wanted to get it done. Product only partially flowed into system, maybe because of the gauge, but got most of the can in.  some of the rest leaked out somehow onto the fill hose. The only thing it plugged was my fill adaptor.  Now, the system isn't plugged and i need to buy a new fill hose adaptor.  For the amount they charge for this, they could at least include a hose that works. I certainly wouldn't recommend it.	-1
I have 2 trucks and bought 2 cans.  One is a 95 chevy k2500 diesel and ive replaced all seals except the ones at the orifice and condenser.  It was leaking down from a full charge in about 5 days of use or non use.  I added a can per directions and recharged.  It blew cold for a  couple days of driving like always...but it has sat for a few days and i tried it tonight..and the clutch was short cycling...low side pressure was down to about 20psi. Other truck is a 97 K3500 silverado with the 7.4.  Has a brand new compressor..condensor..all hoses under hood..all seals..accumulator...orifice tube...etc. Loses charge in about a week...i put my 2nd bottle of sealer in it and charged it.  Same kind of deal...i checked my system pressure and while its still blowing cold..the low side pressure has bled from 40 to 30.  While my leaks are small...it does not seem to be able to seal them.  60 bucks...not well spent i think.	-1
product leaked out faster then the 134a. I even replaced all the "o" rings, compressor, orifice tube and compressor. Don't fall for this product like I did, 30 some dollars up in the air .	-1
followed instructions, except that I didn't vacuum, worked ok for 2weeks, ice cold......then compressor locked up!,,,,am guessing it has blocked the expansion valve, cos the pressure on the low and high side is the same according to the gauges. now am fixing to buy a new compressor, and condenser  etc......2005 4runner, not happy!	-1
This did not work.  The product went in and emptied the can but did not seal the system.	-1
I bought this kit to repair my 1992 toyota camry a/c to try to stop it from leaking. I tried to put the super sealer into my system and never could get any to go into the a/c system. Later I found out that the super sealer was hard in the can. Please don't buy the product.	-1
I followed the directions to the TEE. I own my own pump, so I ran it down and keep it down for longer than the directions said. I did get 2 days of cool from the kit before it leaked out. I replaced the evaporator canister for a lot less than this kit and now all is well.	-1
Didn't work...	-1
The instructions say to connect the can to the supplied hose, turn the can upside down and allow contents to empty into the car's AC system. Well the can "emptied" alright, but only into the attached hose, not fully into the car's AC system. So when I detached the hose from the car (because the can was "empty"), you guessed it, this EXPENSIVE sealant went rushing out of the hose and onto my garage floor. Not happy.	-1
I pulled 30 inches of vacuum for 30 minutes on my Chevrolet s-10 pickup . I installed Cliplight's ss pro 946 kit per instructions. My s-10's ac blew ice cold at first (38 degrees) for like 3 weeks (same as last year) ,then I noticed the ac's not as cold. Now it's lucky to get to 70 degrees. It's obviously leaking. $85 wasted (3 cans 134a synthetic and ss pro kit).  The ss pro 946 kit is supposed to seal any existing and new leaks. A lot of great reviews but I do not think I will use again as SS Pro did NOT fix my trucks problem.  A heads up: the red and blue tamper proof caps are NOT included in the kit any longer.   You get the 1.5 oz. can of sealer, installation hose/tap and label in the box.	-1
B/w copy of copy type instructions are missing a lot of info. Goes from showing it unassembled for grease installation to assembled with a bearing installed for greasing....no breakdown showing order of assembly....W*F are the instructions for this??????? I hate a good product that has crappy support...right outta the box...	-1
This is NOT needed for head units that have DIN screw mounting holes on the side, as the head unit can be attached to the stock frame, and you get to keep the stock cubby hole with door.  (I installed a Kenwood KDC-BT762HD, which has the DIN mounting holes on the left and right side of the head unit that lined up perfectly with the OEM radio frame.  If you are putting another head unit in without the DIN mounting holes, , I'm sure it would work great.	-1
As others have said, this is an extremely cheap product, and I don't recommend it at all. The only thing good I can say about it is that I finally did manage to jam it into my dashboard and manage to squeeze everything else around it, but that's it. I had to really jam the face of the dashboard down to be able to screw it back into place after I installed this stupid bracket, and the box that fills the space right below the radio doesn't fit at all. I had to jam it in really hard into that space, breaking the little tabs off the bracket in the process, and it still sticks partway out of the bracket, looking ridiculous right on the dashboard.  I don't recommend this product to anyone. The only reason I didn't give it negative 15 stars is because at the end of the day I was finally able to jam it into place and it looks basically ok to someone who doesn't know how it's supposed to fit. But buy yourself a dash kit whose pieces actually fit together and which actually fits the cars it says it's supposed to fit. And that's not this one.	-1
I am not trying to be dramatic by leaving a 1 star review like most people seem to, but the bottom line is this product worked so poorly that I couldn't possibly give it anything else.  I had some bubbling up on the wheel arch of my car so I decided to give this product a try while repairing it.  I am a professional bodyman and know a thing or two about doing this kind of work, but all the same I read the directions on the can and online thoroughly and followed them absolutely to a T.  My time is valuable, so I didn't want to leave a single thing to chance and was hoping to never have to attend to this issue again.  After applying the Rust Bullet and waiting the recommended amount of time, I lightly etched the coating to give it some hold for paint and refinished the area with "real" automotive paint (not just a can of spray paint).  Exactly 12 days after doing the job, I walked past the car feeling great about myself and the repair I did, but stopped dead to see that there was a bubble forming already, literally not even two weeks after applying the Rust Bullet, a product which claims to stop rust.  A couple weeks after that, the entire area was completely bubbled and brown with rust stains. It literally looks worse now than it did before I even started.  I know some people claim to have great results with this product, and I wish I knew whatever their secret was.  But I recommend you take extreme caution.  I am really very irritated for having wasted my money and, more troubling, time with this product.	-1
did a frame off resto i figured id try this rather than por 15 what was thinking this stuff is pure s*** its flaking off and rusting where there was no rust now i have to do the job all over again so thanks rust bullet anyone saying this s*** works has not really tried it or is working for the company you can buy por15 for 43 dollars a quart compared to fifty somthing for this s*** use por15 and not be in my shoes having to scrape this s*** off and start over not looking foward to it at all and by the way i never drove the truck just sat outside for the winter covered untill i rebuilt the engine good stuff huh rust bullet my ass youve been warned	-1
Tried it on the underside of my hood.  6 months later i have rust peaking through.  Maybe I didn't prep it right, maybe I didn't put enough on...  Initial impression is not so good.	-1
OVERPRICED.  Bought this with metal blast (which does NOTHING more than vinegar) and very disappointed for the price.. ended up going with TotalBoat Rust Primer, valspar tractor primer and enamel paint.  This was Way cheaper and I believe more effective.	-1
used it as instructed yet rust came thru in a few months.	-1
I did everything that the instructions stated for prep.  I wire brushed and used steel wool to get as much rust off as possible and clearly see where the rust was, then I cleaned the area with cleaning solvent and let it dry. Finally I brushed possibly 4 coats (every few minutes)using the cross etching technique to the various parts of the pinch welds under the car and the wheel wells.  This was done during the Wisconsin summer months and all seemed good so far.  It wasn't until the fall with the rain and cold temperatures that I started to see the rust come through and begin staining. Now that it is winter the rust stains have only gotten worse.  Beting that it is well below the stated temperatures to use Rust Bullet I will cannot apply another coat.  Surprisingly on the pinch welds where I DID NOT use Rust Bullet but had black Duplicolor Undercoating aerosol there has not been any sign of rust coming through the paint (I used the same prep methods).  For this I will not buy another Rust Bullet product and will try POR-15 in black.	-1
I purchased this for my wife for a Christmas present.  After spending over 30 hours trying to install it on our 2005 Camry, I considered it a waste of time and money.  I ended up throwing everything in the trash.  I consulted the mfg and they were not available on Saturdays as they said.  When I DID contact them during the weekdays they expected me to be at the car, which I can somewhat understand, but their advice was still useless.  The advice they gave conflicted with the manual and the web advice.  Their advice was similar to "Just do this or just do that..." and it did not agree with the cautions in the manual.  Their manual conflicted with their web chart.  I really took my time and tried my best and purchased the special adapter harness they recommended.  An extreme waste of time and money.  what a disappointment.	-1
I installed one of these on my 96 Ford Ranger , and a few days later noticed my left brake light wasn't coming on. After checking the light and wiring , I discoved there was no signal coming from the converter unit. So I went down to Auto Zone and picked up a second unit and installed it . The light worked like it was supposed to ... for a few minutes , the quit again . I felt the converter box and it was warm to the touch. I removed it and took it back . I then ordered a third unit from Draw-Tite off of Amazon . I installed it and everything is working fine . I put a stick on the brake pedal and left it on for some time just to be sure . So far so good. I did notice that the Hopkins unit grounds to the frame with a self tap screw , and the Draw-Tite unit grounds back through the factory harness .	-1
This is made of thin, brittle plastic.  The photo shows brass contacts, but the contacts are steel with a thin zinc coating. It rusts easily, unlike the higher quality connectors which use brass. Steel also has a conductivity about half that of brass, which would limit brake current, a possible safety issue.  There is a three-year warranty, but the shipping is on me, and all I would get would be another one with the same deficiencies.   have junked it and bought one with brass contacts. No corrosion problems, now.	-1
Housing cracked as soon as the set screw was tightened down, cheap plastic used in production. Wire hold down tabs very thin metal. I would spend a little extra money and get a quality one if I had to do it over.	-1
Cheep made for the price wait and get a better one	-1
If I could give it ZERO stars I would. Garbage, like other's said arrived defective and does not detect flashers when headlight are on however when I tested the circuit with a meter the circuit is fine. Bad product will be going back	-1
This did not fit my 1997 4runner limited.	-1
Serious issues with my 99 4runner (which was perfect prior to this, minus a dead factory tail light converter)  Plugged it in as-is, have not swapped the turn signal wires as other 4runner owners mention... I actually just found their reviews a second ago.  All was well during garage test but the ABS light came on a mile down the road on the maiden voyage.  It went off and stayed off after I turned the car off / on again a few minutes later.  Did 120+ miles towing a popup one way a few hours later without issue, but on the way back approaching a stop I noticed my turn signal indicator was lighting up when I braked.  Turning left from that stop, my ABS light came on.  So this has gone from intermittent to reliably: use left turn signal, initiate ABS light until car is restarted.  Press brake, illuminate turn signal indicator on the dash.  Just threw a P1780 check engine light today and also noticed the [R] light of my gear indicator on the dash was now faintly lighting up when I applied the brake, 4 days/250 miles after installation.  This code is for 'Park/Neutral position switch sensor failure'.  I can't help but think these things are all connected in some way.  The installation was as they suggested in the manual and I inspected everything on both the vehicle and kit when connecting (I was actually pretty impressed with the quality).  No splices or anything, properly grounded.  **** UPDATE 2 HRS AFTER ORIGINAL ****  I removed the necessary trim pieces, pulled up the rear carpet, and popped the panels out to give me access - again.  Nothing was pinched, kinked, exposed/uninsulated/crossing or loose fitting.  Still, I disconnected and reconnected every harness (while inspecting both the vehicle portion and the kit portion) and even went as far as to drill a new ground, sand, check against test light, and hit with a self tapping screw.  The previous ground was also solid, passed the test light, and was the former ground for 54w of led floods on the rear for years.  Same symptoms.  Took a video of what was going on in the rear and it was a christmas tree - brakes and turn signals were causing other lights to faintly glow.  Passenger brake light was out.  Conveniently had yet another new one to replace it with and magically the problem was gone 100%.  Skeptical of my success, I went for a 15 minute problem-free test drive until I was 1/4 mile from home - braked for a stop light and my left turn signal indicator just briefly lit up and occasionally lit up the rest of the way as I braked.  ABS light came on when I actually used the left turn signal, and I'm back to where I was before.  The bulb wasn't out when I looked so I'm guessing it'll follow the same pattern of intermittent issues to constant to CEL when the bulb shorts.  TL;DR: I think the internals of mine are not well.  Wish I could say it was a wiring issue as I'd just fix that myself and be done with it.	-1
shorts out my lights and blows fuse when trailer is plugged in. Threw it away don't waste your money buy an OEM one	-1
It arrived not working-returned it. checked it with a multimeter and it failed, tested it on a working system and it failed again-it no workie!	-1
The plastic this is made of is brittle and did not work at all for the intended purpose. It broke immediately when put into service. This would be good if you just want something that looks like a 6 pole round connector, but if you actually want to use it buy a metal one. I cannot recommend this at all. Very disappointed and sorry I wasted my money.	-1
Was advertised to fit 98 to 04 Wranglers, did not fit my 01. Each side of my vehicle's harness had 3 wires which requires a 4 into 1 kit as opposed to this 2 into 1 kit. I was refunded my money, but this kit should specify that it does not fit all applications between 98 and 04. As stated above, check your harness before ordering.	-1
Plug it in my trailer and the right side does not work at all. I spent two hours tracing the wire and it was the harness.	-1
This requires a specific flat-4 connector to fit properly. Tried with my generic wiring harness, and the connector is not secured whatsoever. I would have to wrap something around the connector to take up the extra space. Was looking for something secure, not hokey. Garbage it goes.	-1
Came with a broken connector and missing the terminal grease and ty wraps,  Sent back for refund,	-1
Bought at pep boys. Worked the first time used. Unplugged cable and male ground terminal broke. Now my driver side turn signal and brake don't  work unless i unbolt ground from car but lights are extremely dim.	-1
This SEEMED like the perfect solution however it did not work right away. Blinkers both worked but nothing worked if the brake peddle was pressed. I have 40 years experience wiring in automotive. These are simple and BASIC to install and I have done many. You get what you pay for. Amazon was wonderful as I sent it back as defective. READ the reviews on this product, MANY were sent back.	-1
It's certainly simple enough, that part I liked. However the particular brand of four wire harness plug would not fit in this bracket. The plug molding was just too large. With some effort it could have been trimmed or this bracket could have been coerced to fit, but wouldn't provide a clean install as I was hoping.	-1
a single four flat is to small for this to hold it into place.	-1
Tough install - not the fault of the product - the fault of the vehicle manufacturer.  Had to run a wire all the way up to the battery to operate the flashers properly.  Works.	-1
I had a shop mechanic install this for me on mt 2014 Town and Country. My front left signal lights started going out. After replacing the lights 4 different times, i had the dealership look at the cause. They found the cause was this harness, so they unhooked it. No more problems. I wouldn't give this a star at all, but it won't let me do it. Don't buy it!!!	-1
See their still advertising the same picture with dust seal, I brought one figure it came with dust seal no way false advertising. Check Walmart on Amazon .com $2.92  Company fast Eddie won't send one as shown in picture. In my opinion this company is a rip off. Amazon won't help you what you see in this picture there fore I won't buy on Amazon either.	-1
not the one I needed brake lights will not work	-1
Did not work straight out of the box.  I purchased the original one about 9 years ago from WalMart and needed to replace it due to age.  So I purchased this from Amazon and installed it in place of the old one.  Did not work at all!  I took it out and bench tested it, does not work!  I was pissed as I spent all that time replacing the old one with this one.  Luckily Amazon was able to take this back.  Instead of getting a replacement unit, I decided to purchase the better tail light convertor (Hopkins 46365 Short Proof).	-1
Was too big for my new Tow Ready 118472 T-One Connector Assembly that I was installing. The plug is loose in the Bracket and the Cap rubber keeper is too thick to fit in the Bracket. Would be really good if it fit my plug. Will sell at a yard sale for $.25	-1
I could not get the bracket to fit my four pin connector.  The only way would be to remove some of the plastic coating around the 4 pin to get the mounting bracket to fit.  Also, the picture shows a dust cover that is not included.  My dust cover would not work with the mounting bracket even if it would close around the 4 pin connector..  The strap was too short.	-1
The uncovered pin came off and now I have to get the whole thing and Install it again,  Poorly made.	-1
don't buy does not work	-1
Does not hold 4-way flat connector in.	-1
Not compatible with the 118551 4-flat connector.  I ended up using the Tow-Ready 118149 mounting bracket instead.	-1
What a waste of money.  Did not work with the cable I had. It looks like you have to buy the cable they recommend.	-1
did not fit my 2002 Dodge ram 2500 truck as it said it would when I put in the information on the ordering site for my truck.	-1
Did not fit the mirrors on my truck perhaps they were not the original equipment mirrors.	-1
Usually the right turn will fail but it could be any other. a scooter biz that towed trailers went through boxes of these. there has to be something else out there that's not designed to fail. Some of mine lasted two weeks. Very close to being garbage. unfortunately they do what they say -- for awhile. Get 'em by the case.	-1
Okay product.  Did not come with the proper screws and the actual plug does not fit tight enough inside the bracket.  Still feels like I have to hold the back of the plug when I'm connecting my wire for my trailer.  Spend a little extra money and get the CURT 58001 Easy Mount Electrical Bracket and you will be much happier.	-1
it wasn't the right one but I made it work	-1
Did not fit the harness I bought, I had to dremel the crap out of it.	-1
Item delivered Not as pictured Does not include the dust cover. Would not have purchased had I known that.	-1
didn't work	-1
I bought these for my 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 and they do not fit. I sure wish they had included the years these will fit. it's right on the box 1998 to 2001 Dodge . other than that they look like a nice set.	-1
This product is not as advertized.  The pictures clearly show a set of wires, a plug, and a plug cover.  Nothing is included except a bracket and 2 screws.  I emailed Hopkins and asked which of their part numbers did I need to buy to get the complete item as is illustrated in the photo.  They only replied that the bracket is universal.  Don't waste your money on this, you can purchase other items that include everything you need.  I bought one from Curt manufacturing instead.	-1
Did not fit my toe ready wiring!  Disappointed	-1
cheap screws break	-1
poor quality but cheap did not work for Equinox 2010 would not buy again it is just clamp not pig tail as shown in photo	-1
It has a channel inside if for the cover's plastic connecting arm.  It's very narrow and doesn't work with mine.  I am not going to use it.  I am getting the metal bracket that zip-ties around the Kurt hitch for my Nissan Xterra.  And I don't want to drill into the steel bumper, that' asking for rust.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Tow-Ready-118525-T-Connector-Assembly/dp/B006VN3GHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Tow Ready 118525 T-Connector Assembly</a>  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Curt-Manufacturing-13514-Class-III-Receiver/dp/B000JWI8C6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Curt Manufacturing 13514 Class III Receiver</a>	-1
I'm not shocked that there were no wires, even though the picture shows wires.  But I am surprised that the dust cover - which appears to be integral in the picture - is not included.  All that's in the package is the clamp itself and some self-drilling sheetmetal screws.  Maybe I'll check back some day and see that the picture has been changed or the description has been updated to reflect reality, in which case I'll change the number of stars.  But for now, I'm knocking two stars off for the deceptive ad, and another star for the product really being a fairly cheap piece.  In my opinion, the piece isn't a great value; the price is at best only "fair".  And yeah, I know, we're not reviewing prices.  But it's a cheaply-made product which lacks finish; I think the bottom side could've been solid instead of having the exposed ribbing, and I think the included screws (which appear to at least be stainless) should've come with appropriately-sized washers to distribute the load on the plastic.	-1
This is a plastic sandwich type holder for the flat 4 wire connector.  Not only did my connector fit loose and tilt at an angle as a result, but the holder did not have a proper channel to fit the cover for the 4 wire connector I just bought. The channel provided for the cover is very small and is evidently application specific. This was a waste of money.  I had to buy a different mounting bracket from a trailer place.	-1
I ordered 2 of these, 1 for each of my vehicles expecting to receive a whole wiring set  up as seen in the picture but instead all I received was the plastic bracket. Then I looked and realized that the description says "mounting bracket" not bracket and harness. And this bracket does not fit every 4 wire flat connector out there so if you still want to order this, make sure you get it first, and then purchase the harness that fits in it.	-1
It's a $3 bracket so I didn't expect much. That's what I got. Used to install 7 blade connector onto a '98 F150. Bracket was too small for the connector to be properly screwed onto it and none of the holes lined up. With modifications, was able to get 2 of 4 screws to hold the connector on but looks tacky and not as secure as it could be. If I had read the reviews I would have known it'd be a problem. Wasted time and poor results. Should have bought something else but it does work for now.	-1
Item	-1
Holes did not long up with tow ready plug that Amazon recommend this go with.	-1
Did not work for my needs	-1
Only because I did not need it. So its sits in my tool box. But hey! You never know!!	-1
Not as strong as OEM mount, should be built heavy.  There is second part to this, will not work without it. Should come as a full install kit.	-1
Great bracket, EXCEPT it says it comes with mounting hardware.  I bought this with the matching 7-pin socket.  All together I need 6 bolts for this:  2 to atttach the bracket to the vehicle and 4 to attach the socket to the  bracket.  Only 2 bolts came with it.  So instead of "plug and play", it required a trip to the hardware store for #12 bolts.  And there are not step by step instructions, as the description stated.  However, I can't imagine anyone needs them with this simple install.  So its a 5 star for the bracket, 1 star for mounting hardware not be there when they said it would be.	-1
Thin, cheap material!	-1
Pretty flimsy waste of time and money.	-1
Did not need. Could not install wiring harness	-1
so i got this with the adapter "Hopkins 47575" as it was suggested by amazon, however the adapter doesn't need this part and it doesn't even fit it!  wrong suggestion by amazon!	-1
This is a non-standard bracket and will not fit a regular 7 way plug! Do not order this. I'm returning mine.	-1
This fits the 7 way trailer plugs OK, but it's flimsy considering the forces necessary to plug in and unplug the trailer cord.  It should be made of much thicker metal.	-1
Unneeded. One of these came with the trailer socket I ordered.  Also - if you are mechanically inclined enough to install you own trailer hitch, connector, etc. you will want to design something to custom fit your vehicle.  (This would only fit to a flimsy plastic bumper cover)	-1
I bought this because Amazon suggested that it should be bought along with the brake controller. There is no need for it at all as the brake controller mounted just fine with the included hardware.	-1
I bought this for my motorcycle.  I probably would have worked, but, it was larger than the one I wanted it to replace.  I returned it.	-1

This only works for vehicles equipped with the factory TOW PACKAGE - not for use to add towing equipment to your vehicle if it doesn't have factory tow package. If you have the factory tow package, you already have this part. I suppose this is a replacement should you damage the plug on your vehicle equipped with the FACTORY TOW PACKAGE.	-1
Did not like the sound, pretty weak. Had been returned.	-1
They don't seem to work consistently.	-1

Great price. Easy to install. Screwed right on my 2009 Honda Shadow. Sounds like a car now, nice and loud... Had to edit this review... Horn died after a few months... Had to return for a refund.	-1
Installed on my 2015 Durango and trailer lighting is messed up.  Thought it was the trailer lighting, but realized it was the new connector when I checked the trailer with another truck.  Verified connections on my Durango and the left driving light is staying on and the brake/turn signal light is not working.  I had a four prong adapter professionally installed and it works great when not plugged into this adapter.  Should have been an easy plug and play adapter, but wishful thinking.	-1
THE COLOR CODE (WIRE COLORS) DO NOT MATCH WITH THE ORIGINAL PLUG COLORS SO IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WIRE UP . IT'S COMPLETE MESS TRYING TO FIGURE WHICH WIRE GOES TO THE PLUG,THE ONLY ONE WHITE WIRE THAT MATCHES THE REST ARE LEFT TO YOUR IGIMATION .	-1
Installed this a few weeks ago, took the boat out a few times and the 4 pin connector is already wallowe'd out never had this problem with any other connector towed the boat with multiple trucks none wore out like this one.  Would not recommend	-1
On first trip unit shorted out and blew fuses had to take of  and throw away	-1
Did not work for my 2010 Buick Enclave	-1
Failed after about a dozen uses. Only one brake light would illuminate. Connected it to another vehicle and it worked fine. Found that this converter was only putting out one of two brake outputs.  UPDATE: Called the company. They stated that the warranty is 90 days and they would not make an exception.	-1
failed about a year after installing it.	-1
Bought two of these so I would have a spare.  One lasted one trip and the other never worked at all.  Pure junk.	-1
for fifteen to my door how can you go wrong. I didn't have any problems other than having to look a few things up on the internet. I wouldn't pay much more for it though, especially with the cheap 4 prong wire system, I can use my nail to cut through the thin gauge wire and hit the metal wire.. with my nail. otherwise happy.	-1
Left Turn signal dead out of the box.  Signal in to converter, nothing out.  Wasted my time, and that makes me mad! So much for quality control...	-1
The brake light to turn signal conversion did not work out of the box. Hopkins confirmed that is was bad.  Amazon is sending a new one but right now I am sitting with both tail lights removed from the vehicle. Hopkins confirmed that this fault was NOT unusual and suggested I go with a much more expansive converter. We will see if the replacement works.  Stay Tuned!  NO, the replacement did not work either.  Got some Mumbo Jumbo from Hopkins the second time that this UNIVERSAL (look up the definition of universal) kit will not work wit a Saturn Vue.  Both have gone back and I ordered a CORT kit from E-Trailer.  They stated that it will work with my Saturn.  Stay tuned for this continuing saga of how not to build a simple diode matrix the combine brake and turn signal outputs.  The Cort trailer light kit arrived and was successfully installed and is working great.  Highly recommend that Amazon carry this Cort 56175 kit. Paid $23.59 for it.  Sure beats the $75.00 one that Hopkins told me I needed.  Most amazing thing about it, It is marked "Made in the USA"!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
I was disappointed.  Not sure why my experience was different than others but the ground wire was not hooked up, there is no wire in the 4 wire housing, in order to have ground (to have lights etc work) we had to cut the 4-wire connection plug so it would fit into the 4-wire on my truck, after getting it connected found there was no ground in the supplied 4-wire, once we connected the dangling white wire to a ground everything worked.  Was not as plug-and-play as I expected	-1
If the kits converter would not have been faulty I'd give it five stars. Once you figure out the concept it's pretty easy to install. But it took my engineer boyfriend a day to fix. turns out the converter was bad...so he had to directly hard wired it. I may just have gotten the rare bad unit, who knows.	-1
Okay, thought I was getting a deal here, but this kit just connects the car wires to the pigtail and isn't any better than "just" a pigtail. Called the company and they said the 2003 Ford Crown Vic does NOT need the circuit protection "anymore." Noticed that it was changed on other Crown Vic year models also. Not sure if I need circuit protection or not with this car, but got a kit that wires directly to the car battery, just in case. My trailer has a bunch of lights and it's probably cheaper to get the more expensive kit from another company, (Tow Ready 119176KIT from etrailer.com $65) just in case.	-1
This product doesn't appear to have any advantages over any inexpensive trailer wiring kit available from Amazon or any auto parts store or discount store, unless the installer doesn't know which color wire connects where; in which case this kit does at least have that information cast into the plug.  You tap into each turn signal wire, the left brake light wire and the left tail light wire of the car.  But when I finished connecting mine the male ground plug was bent toward the female plugs too far for the opposite plug to fit.  I bent it back straight with my fingernail, and it broke right off!  Examining the broken end, it's obvious that less than 1/4 of the metal prong was connected to the rest of the plug; and the connection was not sunk into the plastic for reinforcement.  Either the design or construction of this part was way substandard.  Since I had already connected all the wires, I just cut the ground wires off both plugs and soldered them to a blade connector.  Next time I'll buy a less-expensive trailer wiring kit.  It can't be any worse quality, and if it's as bad as this one I'll at least get a spare trailer harness out of the deal.	-1
I bought one that turned out to be Missing the white/ground wire to the 4 flat connectors.  [...]  Be sure to check your connector before purchasing. I called 2 different store and the connectors they had in stock were the same as mine. Not as they shopuld be or as shown on Hopkins' website  I rated one star. I would rate it 5 stars if it was properly made.	-1
Picture is deceptive. The 4 way plug only has 3 wires going to it.	-1
Does not work	-1
I purchased these from a local business. Went home, put them on and tightened the back screw as much as possible. You could slide the mirrors right off. I worked and worked with it and decided to give it a try. Drove for 10 minutes and the passenger side flew off, and caused damage to the passenger door of my truck. Does not fit tightly as it should.	-1
Does not fit 2005 Tahoe without modifications, thanks to this garbage fittment my factory paint is all scratched to hell. Update, 2hrs of belt sanding and grinding, $10 worth of foam padding to modify to not scratch. Fits great	-1

Installing the mirror extensions seems a bit cheesy but they held on.  They were somewhat helpful but I didn't notice a big difference so I ended up taking them off.	-1
Clumsy to install. Does not provide the view you might expect.  I had a lot of depth perception and distance ambiguity to resolve constantly.  Probably would've been better off without them, but that's just my perspective of them.	-1
Not very effective for it's intended purpose but it makes me legal while towing.	-1
save your money.  cheap plastic stuff that won't work.  it won't stay on the mirror it is supposed to attach to. falls off blows off.	-1
Items are very Cheaply made, and hard to install.  Better off to upgrade to the factory towing mirrors.  Saves you time and money.	-1
Couldn't believe I had to buy this separate.  Bought Wolos best compressor and a top of the line Horn.  Three hundred plus for the setup.  After it arrives I learn I need this value and a button to make things work.  Companies that do business like this don't deserve our business.  I don't recommend wolos products and I won't buy them again.	-1
This connector is junk... the connectors are very difficult to put together, and once they're hooked up good luck getting them apart! No experience with the other connectors on amazon but i'd try them before buying another set of these...	-1
Blows fuse. They don't get a second chance. Enough said.	-1
Wire to light .	-1
I've owned SEVERAL of these kits.  Why Several you ask? Because they're CRAP. An absolute waste of Money.  "HOPPY" and "HOPKINS"-brand kits burn out in only 1 year.  See my other reviews for more Details.	-1
2003 Toyota Tacoma, this harness is not compatible with LED bulbs.  Switched from incandescent to LED bulbs in my truck and the harness feeds back in the brake lights, knocks the cruise off line when blinker are used.	-1
Easy Installation. Hooked It Up to new set of magnetic trailer tow lights and it when headlights are on and you use the left turn signal the trailer light left turn signal light flashes and the right one flashes alternately at a dimmer brightness. Looks confusing to following driver. I would like to return but did not save packaging material. To eliminate all those that say it may be the magnetic tow lights, I purchased to second set and it did the same thing. This is sufficient to rule out the magnetic trailer tow lights.	-1
This DOES NOT fit my 2000 Outback as described. Going to take major modification to make it work.  Awful Product completely misrepresented.	-1
First, it did not fit my car, so I had to modify it to get it to work.  The unit I got was not the one pictured, the output wires were hard wired. Second, after about 2 weeks it developed a short between the right stop and turn signal, so that they would blink alternately when the turn signal was on.  They blinked so dimly, you could barely see it, and I got the fast blink warning on my dash.  This unit requires a constant 12V source to work.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe to avoid the possible need for a heavy duty flasher??????  The unit I replaced it with does not require a constant 12V, and it works fine.	-1
didn't work.  Returned	-1
It does not work on a 2010 Nissan Xterra as stated. The wiring harness that fits must be connect inside the door on the driver's side.	-1

Good idea, Bad design! I have a street scene SS roll pan. Problems: 1. This made the license plate stick out too much. The solution: I installed it so that it flips down however drive over a bump and flips down.  So it must be installed to flip up. 2. The holes do not match the plate's holes. Solution: slightly bend the frame hindges. 3. The lock mechanism doesn't work. The design is faulty because the semi-ring hook touches the roll pan so it never locks in place. Solution, bend the semi-ring hook. Now it locks closed but not as firmly so it doesn't stay in place and does not close all the way which makes the plate stick out more than it should. 4. The light provided is the cheapest quality. The bulb is glued inside a plastic box basically, if it burns out you have to glue another one.  Over all solution: I removed it and used a hitch plate insert. I modified the product too much so I didn't not ask for refund.	-1
Will not fit my roll pan. The bracket is too large for my pan. will need modification to work on my truck	-1

Garbage	-1
After breaking my 7 blade connector on my 2001 F150 I purchased the Hopkins #40955 to replace it.  Installation was a breeze, it was just plug and play for lack of a better term and I thought I had the problem fixed.  However, several days later when we hooked up our 5th wheel for a weekend getaway I suddenly realized I had no electric trailer brakes and the passenger side brake/tail light was not working.  Being stubborn and a little pissed off I pulled the camper anyways because we were only going about 30 minutes away.  I scratched my head trying to figure out the problem and after reading many other reviews about the problems with Fords I returned the Hopkins #40955 and recieved my money back.  I did some more research and found out that Hopkins #40975 will work on an F150 between 1999-2011.  I plugged it into the original wiring harness and low and behold it worked, problem solved!  My electric brakes worked and so did the passenger side lighting.  As it turns out, I have been told the male blades on the Hopkins #40955 are too short and will not make proper contact with the Ford female connector and that is the problem.  Sure, I could have hard wired the #40955 to my Ford harness, but that would mean cutting off the OEM connector and splicing 7 wires.  Not hard, but that means 7 more corrosion points in the future and another headache as well.  I hope this review will save some Ford owners a major pain in the junk!	-1

Too loose fitting on my 2000 jeep wrangler so I returned them for a full refund. I actually put one on with the top off and when I got in the seat was so hot it burned me.	-1
Does not fit my '99 Wrangler tilt-forward seats. There is no slot for the seat-latch and the material is just plastic. Returned.	-1
Seems to be hit or miss on who has leak problems. The weather stripping on the top of one door is very misaligned so water pours in from the top of the window. On the other side, the door doesn't line up with the back side of the door. In both cases, the gap is so large you can see through it, so you can imagine how much water comes in. There also is a small leak in the glass frame, but it looks like a little silicone may be able to fix that, which I'm ok with.  I'm going to try and remove the top and see it I can force the top to fit the misaligned door. If it works, I'll update this with another stars or two. Otherwise, time to return them and try again.	-1
Junk, a trash bag is just as good a fit.	-1
I have a '94 Jeep Wrangler and these do not fit well at all! Very loose all around. The quality seemed okay but I returned them right away.	-1
This is a really cheesy and generic piece of plastic. I expected A nice custom fit item for my vehicle. This is not it. These were almost $30 but likely worth $4 or $5 for the set. I'm thinking....dollar store! Because they don't fit properly they interrupt the door seal. Haven't driven it yet but I can't imagine I won't have an increase in wind noise. Even more than my '05 rubicon already has. I'd be hard pressed to take a chance on any Bestop Highrock products for my jeep again.	-1
Not wide enough to fit channel for CJ7. Waited for warmer weather to install and am now beyond the return window. Anyone have a suggestion for a better fitting model?	-1
Easy to install, but the snap buttons do not line up. Obviously, this product is made in China and then boxed and shipped by "BESTOP" without checking for flawed and/or incorrect snap position. I could have stopped the installation process and sent it back and then ordered another one, at whose expense and time.....? Also, the term "Black Crush" is misleading.  This is not a soft fabric (such as the material used for soft tops). This is simply $10 worth of black vinyl and two $2 nylon straps. If you feel the need to order this particular top, be fore warned that the snaps may not work due to its incorrect installation location.	-1
I had high hopes for this, even when I saw the label "Made in China". This is Bestop's value range, so Pavement Ends brand must have cut costs somewhere.  I bought it for a CJ7 with a YJ tub and family cage. It shoudk have fitted fine with the CJ full doors as well.  The materiai is premium, like my other Bestop products and should give years of use but the whole top is 2" - 3" too narrow, and I don't have padding on the roll bar. There is no warning that if you have full size doors, this material will not stretch out to the doors and there will be a gap.  The rear straps are on wrong, This will not tighten down on to the rear seat belt mounting as advertised as the straps in the middle are too far away. It looked awful at the back when fitted as the middle straps pulled it down..  I contacted Bestop and they identified my family roll cage may not be original and suggested a few solutions.  In the end I bought some 9" rubber trap straps and fitted them from the rear seat belt mounting to the buckle for the rear straps. This pulled the rear taught. The straps were then taken horizontally to the roll bar and wrapped round but I may as well have cut them off.  The gap to the doors will have to be filled with the metal hoop from the old soft to and some foam rubber when wrapping the roll bar. This is the most disappointing aspect, the narrowness of the material.  Overall it will keep the sun off but when it rains you will get wet in the front, even with full size doors.	-1
not a right fit	-1
Not happy with these at all.  P-I-T-A to install and once you do, when you try to sinch it up using the scure straps, they pull through the plastic hook and then get stuck in the seat cover itself and you cant get them out with out cutting them.  If your looking for something to cover your seats......like for a MUD JEEP not a Daily Driver these will work fine........I should have bought the Bestop seats 1st vs these......Oh well, I guess I will just put these on the old CJ 7 I have.	-1
Nice fit material should be a bit heavier	-1
it's okay, fits and does what it is supposed to do ... but the straps on the back look like they'll last maybe a year, and tightening it down to hold steady at high speeds shows the threads and needle holes where the straps anchor onto the top - which to me means it isn't too likely to last long.  oh well, it's relatively cheap so I can get another one - would rather pay double for a more solidly built one though  edit: replaced it with a usatops bikini with sail battens - night and day for quality, the usatops is about 2.3x as much, but it actually holds up and..get this..doesn't slap around and make noise even at 80 mph!  I actually had to stop and remove the bestop bikini in a 30+ mph cross breeze because it was peeling up over the rollbar from the side and I knew it was a matter of time before that cheap strap and thread snapped (didn't want to get beaten to death by the top).  the new usatops is super solid, no worries on this one	-1
Bought the wrong year for the jeep and had to send it back so we did it use it at all	-1
second attempt at getting a simple fast top for my jeep in the summer again it enterfers with the instlation of my hard and soft top having to install extra hardware that will not allow ether of my other tops to fit properly would say take of your doors and windows with a regular soft top and your good to go instead of waisting your money on this	-1
I would like to give this top a Negative 1 as it has wasted allot of my time. It doesn't fit and will not stay on. Plus it looks awful because the ends on the windshield channel do not lock in. This is a really nice jeep and the cheap top make it look bad. I want to return it and the channel but have not received an authorization yet.	-1
I have a Bestop NX Trek top so I figured this was the best one to get with my Bestop door surrounds. Wrong. This top will wrap around one door surround or the other but not wide enough to go around both. The straps on the back are just barely long enough to work. They must of saved a penny per top making them that short. It works but I wouldn't recommend it if you run a Bestop NX Trek top as your regular top.  Update: One year and a couple weeks since I bought this top; I have only used this top a couple times since the weather warmed up this year and one of the straps broke. As I said when I bought this, the straps are so short that you really have to stretch them to have anything to grab onto when you put it through the plastic buckle. I can already see it sagging where the strap broke which means water will puddle up in that section and dump down the back of my seat when I drive it.  Probably try the Rampage top this time.	-1
This product fits poorly on a 2003 jeep wrangler.  I even checked with the company to make sure I had the right one and was told yes.  We had a good sized rain storm and got two inches of water inside my jeep.  I complained and the company was like oh well basically and it was missing the D Ring straps.  So I had to contact them for them and they wanted to charge me for them.	-1
The rear does not stay down.  Last about 15 minutes down highway and will gain slack then start to flap.  You must have the windshield channel.  I purchased the Bestop version as recommended.  Takes a lot of effort to get the plastic to stay inside the channel.  I had to work one side and tighten it down barely, then move to the other side, jump down tighten it.  Get back on the hood of the Jeep and work it some more, etc.  It's honestly not very practical.  Takes too long to take my hard top off as it is, much less spend another 10-15 minutes putting on a windshield channel and safari top that flaps in the rear.	-1
Good quality, probably fit perfect on a standard CJ Roll Bar. Mine was a custom Roll Cage & it just wouldn't fit right	-1
this particular purchase was a disappointment for me. I had a bestop super top on my jeep and in retrospect, its the only cover you ever need. this safari header style fit in the same channel as the super top. its a thin blade of plastic the slots in the channel and then tightens down. well this top never tightens down. the rear flaps in the wind. it was made of quality materials and that's fine. but they gave up on the rear tie downs it just flaps and gets loose when you drive. disappointed. shipping was good.	-1
If you like riding with the top down this product is worthless to you. Getting the safari top into the channel is a pain in the butt and can take up to an hour or more forcing it in the windshield channel only to see it pop out the other side. Once you get it on the first time it will blow off at least once. The top has to take time tightening before settling into the channel. When you want to go topless again it comes off easy enough but getting it back on could take you up to an hour again depending on if the plastic bits on the safari top want to stay in the windshield channel.	-1
I bought these doors for my 1999 TJ so I could sell the hard doors. I never really liked the full hard doors cuz they were not easily removed or stored. I did the same thing with my previous TJ wrangler too. First off, the doors are made of excellent quality. This time around, I got a set with locks and keys. Sweet! Back in 2004, they didn't include locks on them so they were easily stolen (didn't happen but could have). You gotta do a little assembling before you can get em on the jeep and here's where I ran into a little issue. It seems like the doors were not welded together properly because I could not fit the upper into the lower (driver's side). The three bars that slip into the holes of the lower door were off about 1/2" so I had to force/bend them so it would go in. I also ran into some issues trying to get the doors to seal right when closed. I have a huge gap at the top right corner of the door and water comes in here. No matter how much I adjust them (front lower adjustment bolt/upper window adjustment rods), it will not come close to sealing. But....it's a jeep so I don't care. All i want is something to cover the opening and keep most of the water out and these are doing the jeep. Occasionally you have to remove the doors and turn them upside down to let the water out that built up inside the rubber seal tubing. I plan to close that up with some rtv soon. Overall, they do the job of keeping out (most) of the elements and are easily removed/installed/stored.  Update: The door locks on both doors failed. Bestop is sending me new locks and a new passenger upper piece since that did not fit correctly.  Update #2: The replacement door locks that bestop sent me for free lasted a few months and then they too broke like the originals. Pieces fall out from behind the door handle and it no longer locks. I give up on this chinese garbage. Bestop is supposed to be good but I'm having my doubts. Oh yeah, the passenger door leaks all over the stiches and the pocket fills up with water.  I have lowered my rating to 3 star because of these issues.	-1
I have a stock 1967 CJ-5 with the V6 engine. The top is nice, but it is way too long. It blocks the rear view mirror and goes almost halfway down the back of the jeep. No one can sit in the rear seat with this top on. Does not look like the picture when its on on my jeep. It is about 12-16 inches too long. Other than that, it fits the windshield channel great and looks like nice material. I will have to sew this up to make it shorter to fit better. You can buy, but you may need to modify it for a great fit.	-1
Tried this on my CJ3a. The front fits great. The rear doesn't fit over the roll bar right.	-1
While this looks to be a good quality top (and I believe it is) fitment on a jeep 1971 and older is horrid! It is way too narrow and has odd pockets sewn into the back to "cuddle" the roll bar of the NEWER jeeps with tapered windshield etc. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOUR JEEP IS OLDER THAN 1972, it will look like poo. I don't know how they can even claim it fits 1952 and up, I'd does not... Oh yes you could argue that it can be put on, but there is NO WAY I am going to roll down the street with bunched up vinyl on top of the roll bar and the radius bends on both sides exposed. Oh yeah, the snap flaps don't quite reach around the radius of the windshield either. Like I said, looks to be a great product, but it is false for anyone to advertise that it will fit an M38A1 or any CJ5 etc. before 1972. Just my honest humble opinion.	-1
the driver door fit sucks  they even sent a new bottom half  it too sucks  The passenger side is perfect !!!!  PISS POOR QTY control	-1
Although I am going to try again with another set, the first pair of doors were terribly disappointing. First the good. They looked nice and the door latch assembly seemed to be rigid so I was optimistic. That said, The right side door went on great! The fit after some adjustments was as good as can be expected. The driver door on the other hand was not going to fit even after several hours of playing around with it and trying my best to make it work. the door frame was made too large and the latch handle was so lose it would rattle and had a ton of play in it. I know I could have kept messing with it and cut part of the gasket off to try and make it fit as good as possible but why? For the money the fit and finish should at least be serviceable in my opinion. The gasket was installed incorrectly from the factory so after adjusting it to the best possible fit I could get you still had to slam the door like the hulk after ripping through his shirt! So I will try a second set because its all or nothing with amazon.... So they both go back and I try my luck again. Why? Well because as far as I can see I don't have a lot of choices when it comes to full soft doors. I am pretty patient and have a decent mechanical background... So, I hope the second set does the trick.  Ok, I received the second set and installed them on my 98 TJ. Once again the passenger door went on great and fit nice. This set of doors had no issues with the latch or lever. The driver door fit better than the last set but at maximum adjustment the door is still a little too large and squeezes the gasket out. I spent a few hours playing around with it and got it to fit as good as possible with some custom modifications. I also had to cut a large portion of the gasket off to get the door to close properly. I believe they will keep out most of the rain and I will only throw them on if I want to use the A/C or it's raining anyway. That said, I obviously decided they were good enough to keep but I'm not impressed. I thought these might be my year around door as my TJ is almost always naked (Florida) but I guess I will fix up my half doors and throw them on in the winter because I don't believe these will hold up to regular use but will still be handy in a pinch.	-1
traded em. never could get em to fit just right	-1
The required header mount is a pain in the butt. Wants to pinch off backwards. I used a couple 2x4 s 32.5" to wedge header in place while I ratchet down. Design to header stinks, and does not lend itself to easy on and off for seasonal conversion. Shame on their engineers. Nice customer service folks. Above issues a "norm" for most who have wrestled with these tops.	-1
This product is poorly designed and this is from bestow.  You would think they could design a better easier product to put on.  I fought and fought with it to get it correctly on and still the bikini top does not fit well.  Even after contacting the company they did not seem to care that the customer was not thrilled with their product.	-1
Does not work on any CJ Jeep vehicles. It is designed for the newer Wrangler models.  Please relist this properly.	-1
I followed the direction and this top still fits loose on my 2004 Rubicon with factory door surrounds. The front two door surround clips have come undone on the freeway twice now with everything as tight as I can get it. My other two bestop bikinis have never had any issues with this. I'm packaging up to send back. Not sure if this was a bad batch or what. The seams and fabric seem ever better quality than my two older bikinis but I just tried my standard non safari top and it fits super snug. Weird to run into this with the best aftermarket soft top maker. I'm debating if I should order another one once I send this one back.	-1
First off, like almost all after market products for Jeeps, the instructions are lousy.  There is absolutely no way to install it following the sequence of actions as listed (although it's fairly easy when you work it out for yourself).  Next, an essential strap just broke right off when I tugged on it to tighten.  Third, it's too stiff for a diaper and I can't think what else it might be good for.	-1
i think this product is over-sold. i cleans... but i did not see special magical effects that it does. its just a fancy cleaner. i would still buy again.  UPDATE: ... i think this product is over sold... i don't like it.. its like any other cleaner.. nothing special.	-1
Just received and I'm having problems with it charging. Trying to return and it's not letting me return. I should have read bad reviews before buying	-1
Didn't clear water like I thought, though heater function was nice. Leaf blower did better job.	-1
received mine today and was broken! whole front cover was smashed. ughhhhh	-1
The title of this item is misleading. This brush by Magnolia is called "16" Wire Wheel Brush," while it is actually much smaller, at 11x2.1x2.1 inches. The brush is too small and has stiffer bristles that make it difficult to clean rims quickly and safely.  Check the "also bought" section for the "<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Large-Wire-Wheel-Spoke-Brush/dp/B0007LMC1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Large Wire Wheel Spoke Brush</a>" by Arnold. This brush is much larger at 16.9x2.5x2.5 inches, has slightly softer bristles, and is actually useful for cleaning your rims.	-1
Lasted 15 months - the warranty is 12 months.  Basically $120 thrown away.  I went to use it for the second time the other day and it wouldn't function.  Thinking the charge was low, I plugged it into the outlet and charged it.  All the lights came on and said it was fully charged.  Press the check charge button and it shows fully charged.  Unplug the unit and press the check charge button - shows 1 light (needs charging).  So, I disregarded the display and let it charge for a few hours.  Went to use it again and it doesn't work to start the car.  Not sure if it's the electronics, the battery or both.  Feels like both.  Basically, a paperweight.  Will not be buying this brand again.	-1
Before becoming aware of the new Meguiar's SMAT product combo (M105/M205), I decided to go with the old standby of M2 to start with on my car. Not a good idea. Well, that's not to say that M2 is *bad* per se, but it's a relative pain to use. It dried VERY quickly and was a struggle to remove the excess. That's not what I was expecting. Just trying to remove the product was a serious chore, and the idea of still having to come back with a polish left me thinking I bit off more than I can chew.  I bit the bullet and got some Meguiar's Ultimate Compound (also SMAT technology, it's the consumer version of M105 available locally),and boy what a difference! The working time on the UC was not a problem, and it wiped off easily. If you're thinking about using M2, I would advise you skip it and try UC or M105.	-1
Doesn't work for me. I use many Mequiar products but mirror glaze is a dissapointment.	-1
I've bought other Meguiars products with great success . This one leaves a dull dry shine after a couple of hours . Save yourself the misery and buy something else	-1
I bought two packs of these to go along with their cleaner and conditioner.  The first began to tear at the seam exposing the sponge after three uses (used for cleaning leather car seats).  The second lasted exactly one use with the same tearing at the seam (also used for cleaning leather car seats).	-1
I bought two packs of these (4 total), 3 pads were clearly dropping lints each time I moved it. the cheap clothes at Walmart works better than these name brand.  Will not buy it again. Save your money and buy cheaper towels or get mothers brand.	-1
Absorbed a lot of product. Sponges are much bigger than they appear. Was not a big fan	-1
without comment	-1
falls apart very easily	-1
Had to many fuzzies on it. Let lint balls all over seats. Will not use these again. I will continue to use terry cloth rags.	-1
These wipes didn't work as well as I was told they would by a detailer. I tried to use them for wiping up buffing compound after buffing out a new paint job, You could see fine scratches in the paint after wiping the compound off. Not what I wanted to happen when they claim to be the softest microfiber wipes on the market. I ended up using a soft old t-shirt which worked great and didn't leave any scratches. Guess my hunt for a good, soft, non-marring microfiber wipe isn't over.	-1
Look elsewhere for your caliper piston compressor.  The one I had didn't even finish one brake job before the handle would spin while the metal rod stayed still.  I recommend spending a little more for a tool that has a T-shape handle.  You can buy the full kits for less than $20 (or even rent them for free from Autozone / Advance Auto Parts).	-1
Not even three months later it stopped charging it self.  I did nothing wrong and followed all the instructions.  I have to send the box to kansas to have them put a new battery in it already.  I am not impressed.	-1
I got these to use on my leather clothes and car seat. Very cheaply made. The white lint from the pad comes off and is a mess to pick up from leather clothes and car seat. Go to dollar store and get microfiber cloth !	-1
Was told it would work with LS1 brakes on my Camaro. Too small, may work with smaller stuff like imports though.	-1
Don't do like I did, read the reviews first! It is not lint free and the fibers are easily removed. These are only sown to look like microfiber but are nothing more than cotton sponges.	-1
Sent #7 rather than #9.	-1
it didn't work like I needed it to. the swirls were still there	-1
I discovered this notice when I received this spreader :" This product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm." It's a shame. It should be illegal to sell this product. Also, the handle looks weak.	-1
This unit broke the first time I used it.  The threaded part broke free from the main plate.  I should have been welded.	-1
Do not order this item based on the photo.  The photo is for ASIN B0009OMYBA "Lisle 47400 Brake Spring Washer Tool" which this item is not.

This won't work @ least for the rear brakes on the VW. If your piston has grooves, it means it will get pushed in by rotation only and not with this tool. You can buy another kit that offers adapters for each piston head, or use a simple needle nose pliers, and hold it within the grooves and rotate the piston clockwise and it will go in easy. ( I saw a video on youtube showing this technique when I got stuck with this tool).	-1
Seems to stick readily to the finish.	-1
This product works great on front brake. It does not fit rear brake, at all. my rear brake was too small for this product.	-1
VERY LIGHT DUTY TOOL!  This tool seems to be stamped out of a piece of soft metal.  I bent it turning the adjusting wheels on my brakes AFTER I removed them and used anti-sieze to make certain they turned freely.  It is so weak I am buying another tool in case this one breaks in the middle of a job.	-1
It was too thin to do the job. I ended up getting out my oversized screwdriver. Thankfully it was only a few bucks. I have a feeling it might come in handy for other household tasks.	-1
Way too thin of a tool bent very easily had to switch back to old faithful, a flat head screwdriver. I should have returned it but because of the price I just threw it away. Most of the time "you get what you pay for".	-1
I've used wet sand paper for over 40 years for anything from models to fishing lures to entire vehicles. This paper has a very poor paper backing that tears very easily and won't stand up to vigorous use as all other brands do. Very disappointing for a Mequiar's branded product. because everything else that they market is usually top shelf and the gold standard that others attempt to copy.	-1

Broke after about 4 turns under pressure. It didn;t snap but the threaded housing that forces the pin down came lose so now it just spins with it	-1
Dead after maybe 5 uses. Threaded collar on plate spins free.	-1
I wasn't able to use this tool because it requires 1.1" of clearance between the caliper piston and the opposing inner wall of the caliper. (It's hard to see in the photo but there's a decent sized collar between the clamping point and the retaining plate.)	-1
Does not work well of your brake caliper has 2 pistons, like most newer cars do.  I still had to use a c-clamp with this to get my 2012 minivan's brakes done.	-1
When I received this it was "Mirror Glaze 85" instead of 80 as advertised. This makes quite a bit of difference in the cutting power. I gave it a rating of 1 because of this.	-1
got it cheaper at orelly's auto and send it back and it did not come on time when needed look on inernet be fore buying at amzon you can save 20.00	-1
cheaply made not worth the packaging it came in	-1
I ordered this thinking it would help changing a volvo DOHC 5cyl, it doesn't fit. Too bad they don't list the engines it will work on.	-1
This had good reviews so I bought it. Unfortunately I have had bad luck with the one I got. Bought it brand new from amazon and it will not even turn over my Volvo tractor one time.	-1
This is a worthless tool. It does line up in a way you can use. A basic c-clamp is the way to go. Don't waist your money	-1
I bought one to use at a later date. However my neighbor was changing his pads out. So I offered up this tool. It broke and it is a but difficult to remove. After getting the tool off. I simply squeeze the Pistons in with my fingers. The pistons move slowly but they moved back.	-1
Compressed one caliper and worked fine.  Compressed the next caliper and it broke.  Had to use pliers and vice grips to get it off.	-1
Despite images I found online, this did not work for my 2005 Jeep Liberty CRD / Diesel. The cam gears on this motor are not keyed to the camshafts, which means the tool needs to hold the gears perfectly. There was quite a bit of slop between the threads of the stand off and one of the t-bars which made it wiggle. But, there was simply no way to install this onto the teeth of the gears when they were in the correct position. Its nice that it was metal, unlike a lot of the plastic ones available for sale	-1
Wilwood calipers on 70 Challenger. This tool to large to fit in caliper. Wasted money, not worth the time or money to return,,,,nor to review for that matter. What was I thinking?	-1
The first one got sent to montana( i live in illinois), a week later i get the second one.  It doesnt work very good, not strong enough to hold while loosening the belts bolts so you have to realign anyways.  save your money	-1
Doesn't work for 2002 Mazda protg five.	-1
Broke on first use.	-1
Although I guess it does what it's supposed to do. It was completely unnecessary and caused problems for me. I had to remove the sprocket so their is no way to get the sprockets in same alignment with this tool. I got some bad advise and was told this would hold the sprockets while I remove the nut. Which was not true at all. I actually got worried that I damaged a valve in the process but fortunately did not. Better instructions / warnings should be included with this equipment. Because it actually has limited applications, in my opinion.	-1
I like this product OK but do not recommend. Didn't do much of anything. Seller is horrible too would not accept return.	-1
Screwing it in all the way, the shaft is too short to fully retract my BRZ's rear brake caliper.	-1
I had a bad experience with this product. Left a dull look to the paint, plus streaks. I tried two different ways, after washing, and after drying and both left the same result. Maybe it is not compatible with Menzerna products. I have a 2014 Impala (Blue Ray Metallic) that I polished, sealed and waxed using Menzerna. This didn't work for me. I'm going to try Last Touch Spray Detailer next.	-1
I bought this to use for the piston on a front brake job on a Toyota Corolla 2006 but it does not fit and is too short.  I found using a c-clamp was the best way to go and I had no trouble after that.	-1
This is a very crappy product, cheap made back bracket bent in V shape on the first caliper. Do not waste your money.	-1
I used this product on the rear of my disc brake calibers and it was a big wasted of time. Did not push in the piston. I had to use a 6in. C-CLAMP which worked out pretty well.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Lisle-Disc-Brake-Pad-Spreader-LIS-24400/dp/B00B3HXZBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Lisle Disc Brake Pad Spreader LIS-24400</a>	-1

This is not the best spreader on the market but what do you expect for $10. The twist handle is so short you can't hardly get any torque on it. So if your twelve years old it'll be find	-1
Even screwed all the way down it would not fit in to allow me to compress the brake piston, use a C clamp, this was useless for me.	-1
Had all sorts of trouble using this but I will keep it in the tool box just in case I find a use for it.	-1
Yes this is no different than any other carnuba wax.	-1
Not very good Spring affair is terrible Socket adapter is thin Works on end of oil filter were its the weakest - if you need to remove a real tight oil filter then you want to be as close to the base as possible It works - but theirs much better	-1
I experienced the same problem as many others:  the assembly will not build vacuum due to leaks around the connections.  The pump works fine with just the tubing connected.  As soon as the reservoir is attached, it will not build vacuum beyond a couple inches Hg.  I removed the reservoir and attached the hose directly to the bleed screw and it would still not generate vacuum even though the hose appeared to be a snug fit over the bleed screw nipple.  Based on the disappointing responses of others who contacted the manufacturer, I decided just to return it and avoid the hassle.	-1
I guess you get what you pay for, but 1) No sign that its made in the USA as other reviewers note; 2) Its small and will NOT work on larger caliper brakes; 3) Not of amazing quality like other reviewers note. Seems a bit cheaply made actually. Its going back.	-1
TOO THICK WILL NOT FIT 2011 YUKON DENALI	-1
Handle held together by a rolling pin, which rolled its way out and onto the ground.  The first time it happened, I was able to find the pin and, with difficulty, get it back in place.  It fell out a second time and I could not find it.  I wasn't able to make it work and losing the pin was the last straw.	-1
Use a ton of meguiars products This product disappoints in every way Does not make slick upon removal Wax strips in under 30 days under light washing Has zero cleaning properties If you try to use before a cleaner wax or clay bar treatment you'll lock all the contamination into your paint I used this product for professional purposes Did somewhere near 3 dozen cars and scrapped it You use average product for production and at $30 a gallon it's not out of line, just couldnot take the inferiority I didn't like to use cleaner wax bc I prefer the customer purchase the clay bar treatment but for the sake of quality switched	-1
fantastic product but 5 starts again leads to price fixing better than any product you buy in a retail store less goes farther and you don't get that awful white drying marks later on and it lasts for quite a long time as well. i wax let it dry for about 20 minutes high humidity here and then use a orbital buffer to take it off and buff it out and lastly i follow with megs quick detailer the pink one to get any spots i may have missed. great product will continue to buy it.	-1
dont buy it. it's a piece of crap.	-1
Just plain junk	-1
I bought this in May of 2016 and apparently got the only bad one ever made. It reads 8 psi high @ 30 psi. and the stick feels really loose. Milton brand is supposed to be good stuff. Maybe I'll get a $2.00 Chinese gauge next time. Couldn't be worse.	-1
Really the only purpose I bought this for was to be able to bleed the brakes on my motorcycles by myself.  This does not work well for that purpose.  It seemed like a good idea, but with so many connections between the bleeder and the gun itself, there is too much air leakage.  If it could hold a vacuum it would really be slick.  The gun leaks down with the bleeder closed, so I know when I try to bleed the brakes, a lot of the air I see in the tube is being introduced after the bleeder.  I tried and tried, thought if I just make sure I close the bleeder before the vacuum gets completely away, it would eventually bleed the brake line.  After trying for 2 evenings, I gave up.  This looks like a very nice kit, the gauge is great; it even swivels!  Feels like a quality tool, but after trying different tips, plugging and replugging lines, trying to get rid of the air leaks; just can't recommend this if you are needing it for brake work.	-1
QURAP, VERY LITTLE SUCTION, CANNOT FIND ANY LEAKS, HAD THE ORIGINAL UNIT (MADE OF PLASTIC) THAT WAS OVER 20 YEARS OLD THAT FINALLY DIED, THOUGHT THE METAL WOULD BE AN UPGRADE.	-1
Just as the headline says, this thing is a hunk of junk. Will it remove and install cam bearings??....Yes...But it puts dents in them from the way the mandrel expands and grips the edge of the bearings. Thank the Lord I tested it first with used bearings to practice....Never again. Should have listened to my teachers in Overhaul class...these are the poor mans/ghetto way of doing cam bearings. Proper way is with an aluminum puck cut to size on a lathe.	-1
Canister that came with set does not hold seal. The pump seems to work though.	-1
Had to fight a oil filter, pulled this new filter wrench out to give it a try. Well not that great of a product on a tight filter. Messed with it for 20 min. Then pulled out my old 3 jaw oil filter puller, that's the way to go, got it right away. So my opinion is to go with the 3 leg or 3 jaw filter wrench. Bad design compared to the 3 post	-1
Used it to bleed a clutch line, Pretty much useless, just get a 100cc syringe by vvw instead, it is way more effective and quite a lot cheaper. The vacuum chamber on the mity vac leaks when back bleeding, plus all of the hoses and stuff tend to leak at the joints.	-1
I was so excited when these were delivered today ( I love free next day delivery) so I could finally remove and replace the carrier bearings on my Dana 44HD differential.  The Pinion bearing came off fairly easily using my Milwaukee 2763-22 M18 1/2" Inch Impact Wrench.  Lots of power.  I then went after the first of two carrier bearings.  It was everything I could do to get the bearing to "split" from the trunnion shaft but it finally did with some persuasion from a 2.5 lb single jack and an air impact socket as the punch.  removing the bearing splitter was a whole other story.  I noticed while torqueing down the nuts that they were splintering off metal shavings as they were turning against the clamp body.  After removing them, I also noticed that the threaded shafts had lost quite a few threads.  Tool steel?  I was able to completely unscrew the nuts from the shaft and clean up the shredded metal from the now mushroomed base but I wasn't able to thread the nuts all the way down the shaft any longer.  I managed to get the splitter back on the opposite trunnion and barely able to separate the bearing from the base when the splitter gave out altogether.  Did it do its job?  Kinda.  Will I be able to use it again?  not without cutting the old threaded rod in half and buying new threaded shafts and nuts.  I don't intend to ever need one again but I guess I expected my money to go a little further than a single use.  I wouldnt recommend this tool for this job.	-1
I had this thing for a few months and it worked really well for taking off oil filters. It only made it through like 3 or 4 filters until the spring broke though. I don't recommend buying it.	-1
Spring is weak and pops off.  Arms do not slide in or out smoothly.  It is a real fight if you are upside down, standing on your head.  If it will fit your filter well and you have three hands this is the wrench for you.	-1
3 things. #1 Spring is cheep and installed incorrectly. Snapped on unpacking so i had to twist it to place it the right (better) way and twist the ends toward inside more, because spring is made of cheep metal that bends like aluminum. #2 Size is too big for regular car filters. Toyotas/Hondas/Motorcycles ETC. Maybe a 5Lite For 3500 utility van will have enough filter diameter for this to fit around, or a huge SUV or a pickup truck. #3 Removal only. does not work the other way around to tight the filter.	-1
I change my own oil on my Z and this wrench adapter worked great the first oil change. Upon doing my 2nd oil change the spring shot off and I for the life of me could not find it. Searched everywhere. Disappointed as the grip was great. Outside of 30 days so that was a waste of some hard earned money.	-1
I think this was my fault for not reading every line of the description before buying.  I saw words like wide range and universal and biting teeth...  What I missed was that it works from 3 1/8 to 3 7/8 inches... I am sure I'll use it, just not as much use as I'd hoped it would get.	-1
I think the idea is great but the filter on my Honda is just too small and it won't adjust any smaller.  It would help if they were to put a man and min diameter that it can take on the advert.	-1
i replaced my ancient plastic mityvac with this new metal one and it's far inferior. the plastic used in the bleed res kit is so soft the cap won't stay on, and the mechanism to hold the lever on the pump twists and comes off while you are using it. i contacted mityvac and they were unresponsive. don't expect this to be any better than the old one, or the harbor freight model.	-1
I searched a lot before deciding to buy this product as I was looking for a kit that would work for servicing my 2 bikes (a Suzuki vstrom DL650 and a Honda Valkyrie I/S).  I received the kit on the promised date and read the instructions carefully as also watched videos on youtube teaching how to use the product. Even went through the trouble of sealing the break line bleed valve with teflon tape when installing the kit drain tubing.  When I got started bleeding the breaks from my Vstrom, it started leaking air through the drain oil reservoir and not only was unable to keep a vacuum but instead *injected* air through the motorcycle brake lines (to the point of making air bubbles to boil the oil on the motorcycle brake reservoir, spilling oil over the place).  The damage wasn't even bigger because I was careful and protected all the area around the gas tank with paper towels before getting started (but otherwise, it would have ruined the gas tank paint as DOT4 fluid damages painted surfaces).  I had to drain the brake lines 4 times using the goodie and oldie method of pumping the brake lever to get ridden of all the air that mityvac introduced into my motorcycle's brakes. Wasted 3x the time to perform a simple operation and could have damaged my motorcycle.  To add insult to the injury, to return this I had to visit a UPS store and buy a cardboard box (7USD = box + assembly) as the UPS pick up guy refused to receive the kit in its case with no cardboard box. Factor in the cost of gas to drive from my place to the nearby UPS store and you see that this was not only a waste of time but made me loose money. I bought this to save time and not having to ask help while doing a simple maintenance operation.  Searching about the issue, it seem that is quite common for the drain oil reservoir to leak air (and the 'fix' of adding teflon tape around its cover didn't work too).  Final remark: if you are lucky and got one that is not leaking, you may be happy. But I have the impression that this is like flipping a coin (and I definitely don't like to rely on luck when comes to tools).	-1
Arrived with defective plastic bottle, which makes this borderline useless if you're hoping to use this as a brake bleeder.  The bottle wasn't broken, it was simply manufactured incorrectly. As in, the lid won't fit. I e-mailed the company and was told that they were aware of the problem, but they refused to replace it, instead inviting me to order a new bottle and lid for about $10.  No thanks. Steer clear. There are plenty of cheaper alternatives out there, perhaps run by a company that has a clue about customer service.	-1
I purchased this vacuum pump for the soul purpose of bleeding auto brakes. I thought that it would be a quick, clean, easy way for me to do brakes by myself. It did flush the two rear brake cylinders. It did not actually create a vacuum reading on the gauge. It did suck a huge amount of air around the bleeder  screws with the brake fluid. (No amount of grease or liquid gasket material stopped the leaking.) I had to constantly pump the vacuum pump trigger to get the fluid out. The bleed hoses are stiff and the fluid holding container is light. If you are not holding the container in your hand it will tip over and allow fluid to leak into the vacuum gun. It is messy to clean up. And the case that holds everything is so light that the case tips over and spills all the fittings all over the place. I regret ever purchasing this item. (NO matter the cost.) I flushed my front brake calibers the old fashion way. My daughter pumped the brakes while I bleed the fluid through a hose to a container. I strongly recommend against purchasing this item.	-1
about as accurate as kicking the tire.	-1
althought after the initial treatment the paint did feel really slick, that wears off after the first washing.  there is still some beading 6 months later but not much else.  and there is no cleaning or polishing attributes to this sealant.  for my money,  i feel any wax thats half the price or less gives just as much or better protection.  try the mirror glaze cleaner wax, mothers cleaner wax, nu finish polish, or  zymol cleaner wax instead. klasse all-in-one works great but it is kind of expensive, a little goes a long way, and kinda tricky to apply	-1
this product performs no better than $5 turtle wax	-1
If you got wrists like Charles Atlas you may be able to use this tool. pump,,pump,,pump,,,,,....unending... i would say this is an ocasional use tool only. i had to ty wrap the fittings and hose on because the leaked,,both pressure and vacume.	-1
The first one I bought did not hold vacuum or pressure at all.  It leaked down from 20 lbs to 0 within a minute.  We called  Mityvac manufacturer tech support and they answered the phone within a minute and they made suggestions. He said the unit is tested before it leaves the factory and should hold vacuum.  Then he said to get some silicone oil and take apart the plunger and make sure the flapper seal was not out of place.  I drove to a hobby remote control store and bought silicone oil 15W and silicone grease.  I took apart the pump and checked everything and oiled the plunger and greased all of the O rings.  The vacuum still leaked from 20 lbs to 0 in a minute.  I wasted $8 on the oil and two hours of time.  The good news is that I believed the Mityvac technician and I ordered another identical MityVac, hoping it would hold vacuum.  YEAH!. It held 20 lbs vacuum and pressure for 12 hours without leaking at all. Now I have a working Vacuum pump and I can test my projects.  I oiled and greased the replacement, just in case.  Bottom line, if you order one, test the vacuum and pressure holding time right away.  It should hold vacuum and pressure forever.  If it doesn't, you have a legitimate complaint and can exchange it.  Obviously the factory test is not very good.  Good luck.	-1
I purchased this for the intended use and was happy when I received it quickly from amazon.  First thing I did was try to test the mityvac by taking the bottle and putting on the transfer cap (the one with which you can use to hook up to the pump) and noticed that it took some force to turn and lock onto the bottle. Finally got it secured and noticed that the rim looked a bit lumpy. Checked the underside of the cap and saw that it wasn't sealed properly and tested it by placing finger over hose and pumping.  Vacuum didn't hold because the misalignment in the cap was not air tight. Removed the transfer cap and tried the storage cap and it was nice and easy. Didn't look like it was misaligned or anything.  Needless to say that I couldn't use it for bleeding the brakes and did it old fashion way.  I wrote an email to mityvac and told them about the situation and they said that Amazon is not an approved vendor. Yes, the biggest online retailer on the planet is not approved by mityvac for them to send me replacement parts due to a manufacture defect.  I've read my great things about mityvac, but if they cannot even warranty something as simple as a transfer cap and maybe the bottle, then it has no use in my toolbox.	-1
very bad experience, this thing came dead from factory. it had no vacuum pressure at all. i wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. save your money this is a total waste.	-1
we returned it as the bottle had frozen at one time and didn't work as expected	-1
I just got off the phone with the company that makes this device along with several other scanners, they are now pushing what is called an Actron scanner. Here is their # 800-228-7667. Who knows how long it will be before they discontinue that line as well. I paid over 400 dollars for my scanner several years ago and went to update the software recently,only to learn the device is now obsolete. They stopped making them in 2007. Needless to say I now have a high dollar scanner that is worthless for vehicles over 2007 and am very p....off to say the least.  So when I saw this ad for autoxray that I know specifically is discontinued, I called the company back and asked why are you still selling them, they replied they must be old models floating around the internet because they are no longer available.  I didn't want anybody to be mislead, so that is why I am posting this, save your money and buy a device that is current. Again if you want to check for yourself the number is listed above.	-1
i have had this for 3 years approximately and used it on about 12 cars and it quit reading gm cars. after reading more online i am finding that many many people are experiencing these dieing early death or stop working after update.  at first the performance of this product was lackluster and slow at best. it would read all cars but the read rate was terrible. then one day i hooked it up the read data from a grand am and i got an error code for the unit saying it could not connect. i tried a cavalier and got the same thing. the advertisements for autoxray should read that its only good for a dozen scans and goes some for retirement. i paid 300 bucks for a piece of crap that they won't fix or replace. if you like wasting money buy this. there is no excuse for this POS! i had to give it one star to post this review it doesn't deserve that.  The update they like to talk about......Well it never did anything for me and going by what some said it can actually brick your scanner. If I it was supposed to give any more functionality I didn't see it and the software for me only works in windows XP! NICE.  cars it won't read  97  pontiac grand am 97  cavalier 99  cavalier 2002 cavalier 93  grand prix 98  grand prix  so far no help from the tech support either. i have an old actron original obd scantool that is 12 years old and have used it on a hundred cars and to this day it worked on all gm cars i used it on. i have always taken great care of my tool it is clean without so much as a scratch on it so it has not been abused or broken.  update: i have been checking posts across the internet and so far i have not seen any proof that this company has taken care of any of the problems people are having with these defective devices. but they are still willing to take your money.  PLEASE CLICK HELPFUL IF THIS WAS OF USE TO YOU.	-1
I baught My Autoxray EZ-Scan 6000 about 3 to 4 years ago. I've tested about 3 automobiles for personal use. The Scanner Quit Working , so i called the help Number. They said that they did no repair on them. and tried to sell me a new one. They still tell you where to buy them at thier web sight. I lost several hundred Dollers. !!!!!!!!!Do not buy Autoxray code scanners unless you want grief!!!!!	-1
Forget this scanner. It does the job for which it is advertised, but the implication that it will receive continuing updates and support to the owner is not reality. AutoXray has been sold to another company and there is no support for this tool. In following the website, I see that it has not changed in the 4 years since I purchased this too. It is an orphan. If you already own this tool, what you have now is probably all you will ever have. I would not buy this scanner new with zero manufacturer support.	-1
MOST vehicles can be tested KOEO (key on, engine off - memory codes) with an analog voltmeter and counting needle sweeps, or looking at the CHECK ENGINE light and counting flashes.  Just because a code reader gives you a "32" doesn't mean you have a bad part relating to that number. An EGR valve stuck open from carbon on an older EEC-IV Ford will give an EVP sensor out of range (its not fully extended). A kinked MAP sensor hose will give odd problems and false readings. A generic TFI (ignition module) will have your car running like crap with no end to repair bills in sight (until you get a Motorcraft TFI again!).  This item is by no means a "magic wand". I had a chance to use one at a friends house...his hesitation problem was nothing but old spark plugs (platinum plugs are junk: get copper core; AC Delco or Motorcraft). This reader (AS ANY READER) will ONLY get codes STORED in your ECU, or "hard faults" in a KOEO test. Manufacturers used to make the processors "dumb" so they wouldn't store a code if the error only happened a few times - I feel they are doing it again.  If this is the "Lincoln" of all testers, it should come with a BETTER way to hook it to a PC - like an USB port.  I do like that it comes in a case...a small sheath would just hold the broken parts inside when it would be dropped.  I rate it 2 stars only because the retail price is ridiculous. The product itself is a 3.5 or so.	-1
First, this pencil type gauge does not produce repeatable measurements. In a group of five measurements made on the same large automotive tire, the readings varied by 4 psi. That's 10% of the inflation pressure of the tire.  Second, the gauge isn't accurate. The group of five measurements averaged 44 psi, again on an actual inflation pressure of 40 psi.  A ten percent error either way is unacceptable in any gauge measuring tire pressure, especially when it's used on motorcycle tires.  Third, when I tried to return the item, which is sold by Tool Deals but fulfilled by Amazon, my Amazon Orders page told me it was non-returnable. When I looked up the Tool Deals return policy, it referred me to the Amazon.com return policy, which is 30 days. So I called Amazon, who issued an Amazon gift certificate for the cost of the gauge. Thanks Amazon, but I'll never purchase anything from Tool Deals again.  It's worth noting that a growing number of people are complaining about this gauge in the reviews, but because there are so many reviews, that number is relatively small and the gauge comes out with an overall excellent rating. Seems to me that the folks that give it a good rating have no way to assess either the repeatability or accuracy of the gauge, and aren't even aware of how far off their tire pressures are as a result.  Buyer Beware!	-1
Purchased this wax mostly due to the great reviews. Just got done waxing my motorcycle (black valkyrie) and would rate this product average in every aspect (don't know about durability yet). I can get "average" for about $5 cheaper and next time around I will,	-1
This is the cheapest version I've ever had....materials are poor and it doesnt measure correct. I don't understand how is it possible to had so much high scores and reviews. DO NOT buy this	-1
got this for plastic parts on our RV, in particular the propane tanks cover. does not work, smears, and in a couple of days the black is back to faded looking.	-1
Save your money and go to your boxstore and get much cheaper car wax--works just the same.  This product does not leave any better shine than cheaper turtle waxes.	-1
I found this difficult and frustrating to get accurate, consistent measurements. Ended up buying a different tire pressure gauge at the store, one with an actual gauge on it and a release valve.	-1
Garbage...felt apart shortly after minimal use.	-1
I'm bucking the trend of favorable reviews here.  I do give it two stars because it does go on easy, smells decent, and has excellent cleaning capability.  The towel came out more black than with other products, which I assume indicates it is removing a lot of oxidized black rubber/trim.  Unfortunately, this product does NOT last.  I covered all the rubber/plastic on my car (two thorough coats), let it soak in/settle for a day, then washed it to get the overwipe/streaks of nearby body panels, etc.  The Meguiar's #40 washed completely off.  It was left worse than before I used the product.  The finish remaining was also very splotchy and looks bad.  Even some interior parts that I applied #40 to were mostly wiped clean after just wiping with a damp towel used to pick up accumulated dust/dirt.  It remained splotchy where there were minor nicks scratches in the plastic/rubber where more #40 had absorbed.  Overall, I was very unsatisfied with the results.  I'm not going to say it is the worst product I have ever used, but others that I use are far and away better.  These include 303 Aerospace Protectant which is a very mild, water-based product which also doesn't last but is better than this Meguiars product and has almost no sheen.  My previous staple and which I recommend most is actually Armor All Original.  I purchased a Guru Reports analysis on these types of products several years ago and was surprised that this "old" product was one of the two best-in-category products (along with Zaino) among over 50 that were tested.  Armor All Original (not other formulations) is very low sheen and also lasts several washes.  It is also about 1/4 the price or less and available everywhere.  I'm going back to Armor All Original and recommend that you try it as it performs better than "boutique" products.  I would also recommend that you use water-based products on permanent trim, rubber, etc., as the solvent/petroleum-based ones have a tendency to degrade the rubber/plastic over time.  These may be OK for replaceable items like tires or parts that are severely oxidized.  You can generally tell the difference in that water-based products are milky color while the petroleum-based ones are clear.  I do like Meguiar's Hot Shine for severe problems, but not this product.	-1
My first attempt using this cap filter and it broke on me. Looks like welding wasn't strong enough.	-1
Don't waste your money on these things. Get the "1/2 Square Drive 65mm 14 Flutes End Cap Oil Filter Wrench Auto Tool". They do the job!  The GearWrench just slips around the filter.	-1
did not fit despite description	-1
Broke on the first use, tells you everything you need to know. Look for something better	-1
Can't get it on zerk mybe I'm a wimp	-1
Broke first time I used it!! 4 tiny spot welds. Can't believed I got sucked into it!!	-1
Didn't work very well in my opinion.	-1
This is a piece of junk and broke the first time I used it.  Then I was left with the broken tool stuck on the oil cap.  See my other reviews and get the heavy duty one.	-1
I bought this specifically for my Tru-Cut  mower, model H20-H5-7, because there is one zerk fitting next to the blades that is impossible to get to with the standard grease gun attachments.  Based on the description of the product, I thought this would do the trick.  I was able to position it over the zerk fitting but I just couldn't get it to slip on.  It appears that the opening is just too small for the zerks on the Tru-Cut.  I also earlier bought the Lumax LX-1404 Silver 90 Degree Grease Coupler for the same fitting but that was too large to get into that cramped space.  I wanted to post this because I didn't want anyone else who owned this same mower to waste their money.  Fyi, I checked with the local distributor of Tru-Cut mowers & the service tech there told me that they don't even bother with that fitting.  He said they just spray onto all chains a high speed chain lubricant like that used by motorcyclists & that would suffice.	-1
It may fit in those hard to reach areas, but the lack of adjustability means it leaks grease and cleaning those hard-to-reach areas is even more frustrating.	-1
I bought this for my 2010 Camry V6. I saw other reviews saying it would worked on their 2GR-FE Motor but its a little too small. I found a filter wrench in my Harbor Freight set that fit.  I don't know if they changed something at Toyota but this didn't work for me.	-1
I could not make this Thexton 418 work. I tried it on several fittings and each time the grease just shot out the end of the coupler. I tried several different positions, but still could not get it to work at all. I finally gave up and put the old coupler back on the NAPA grease gun I have been using since 1975 and it worked just fine. I just threw the coupler in the trash as it was not worth sending it back to Amazon. Other people have given this coupler great reviews, I am not one of those people.	-1
I used this one time and after that the nut on it broke loose . But it did fit ok. Looks like they glued the nut on it. Won't replace it so I have to take it and get it spot welded on. Shame they make tools that cheap.	-1
Gauge funtions nicely. Black English graphics very good. Metric red graphics TERRIBLE....arrived smeared, rubs off/worsens when gently wiped with towel. Is this what they call crapy American made??????.....I think so, sadly!! Most Chinese cheapies have superior graphics, no smearing, more legible............ie Note to Milton....after so many years mfr'g this gage seems irresponsible/awful QC has infested your company!!!!....get wise or go bankrupt!	-1
I used it on 2 vehicles: 2008 Toyota Tundra 5.7L V8 2009 Toyota Rav4 4 cyl  It fits both Toyota vehicles, because they have the filter housing with replaceable filter media cartridge, but it is also has a loose fit on both. The problem is that because it is a little loose, it can get stuck on the filter housing. The looseness allows it to slip a little and jam the filter housing in the tool, making it difficult to remove the tool from the housing.  The reason for the 1 star rating is that when I bought the used 2008 Toyota Tundra in 2011, the filter housing was on very tight. I was able to remove the filter housing, but the tool was jammed on it. While trying to remove the jammed tool, I dropped the housing and perforated tube in the housing came off. I wasn't able to reinsert the perforated tube into the housing properly and had to purchase a replacement from the Toyota dealership. That is partly my fault for having butter fingers, but if it fit properly this would not have happened. Any money I saved by purchasing this tool was lost when I had to replace the filter housing.  I think the tool is poorly made and you would do better to purchase a better quality tool and save yourself from problems caused by this one.	-1
I work with lots of tools in my job and in my opinion this is a real piece of junk, cheaply made aluminum with the socket piece spot welded on. The socket connection broke off the first time I used it because some gorilla tightened the oil filter cap too tight. Now I have to find a decently made one.	-1
dont buy this product, I  bought it for my 2010 toyota corolla because you need a special tool for the oil filter housing, the put where you insert the wrench into broke on the first turn, waste of money. at least amazon let me return it broken.	-1
this socket is strong, but not strong enough to take off some canister filters. mine snapped when removing a corolla filter.	-1
Failed on second use, nut separated from body. Took broken shell to department store and found Toyota filter housing is same as Puralator L14477 filter if you don't have time to order one.	-1
This tool is what you'll need for working on Toyota cartridge filters. I've used it for about a year now.  But it's got two major flaws about it.  It takes a 3/8 male end but where that end connects is a bit flimsy. You can expect that "square" female end to start rounding out a bit. You'll still be able to use it, but the fact that this happens at all reveals that the metal quality of that end isn't all that it should be.  The real problem is that the cap is constructed in two pieces. The 1) cap and 2) the center metal piece for the 3/8 ratchet socket. The latter piece is glued or welded onto the cap. If the filter housing is on tight enough (it shouldn't be but sometimes it is), the cap will break in two - the center piece will sheer off the rest of the cap.  If you're looking for a subpar piece of equipment that'll last you a few oil changes and no more and you don't mind flimsy metal material and bad welding, then this product is all that you'll need. But if you want longevity and quality look elsewhere. KD fails here.	-1
I needed this to change an oil filter of 65mm, like the Fram 7317 for a Honda. It is described by KD Tool as a 65mm end cap tool. Not so. This is actually a 64mm end cap. Measured 64.3mm at the mid-point of flute using my commercial grade micrometer. This can NOT work on a 65mm oil filter like the Fram 7317 which is 65.4mm (with black grip coating) at the same point. IE unless one starts banging it with a hammer!!!	-1
solid enough metal to work w/o flexing.  will NOT work on 2008 toyota highlander, 3.5 engine.  too small diameter.  even tried moderate amount of pressure hoping for a snug fit but never worked.  don't buy for this model hoping it will work.  i don't understand how other sites when searching w/ google describe a 64mm as what's needed.  if this is truly a 65mm and too small...	-1
This thing really is a piece of junk. Would not fit my 2010 Rav4 at all.  The nut that you put your 3/8" drive into broke off before I could even use the tool.  The wrench I got had two levels of diameter.  The first level was too big in diameter and the second level was too small.  I bought an Assenmacher ASTTOY640 and it fit perfectly.  Don't waste you money on the KD end cap.	-1
Did not fit oil filter housing on 2009 Toyota Highlander, counter to other reviewers.  Maybe they made this unit a millimeter or two smaller than before.  Disappointing.	-1
This was suppouse to fit my 2010 RAV 4 filter canster, but it slips and does not fit, really a useless piece of junk stay away from it, but the Assenmacher TOY 640 oil filter socket wrench fits perfect, BUY THIS NOT THE K-D 3253. You've been warned by a person that went through oil fliter wrenches till I found one that works ! !	-1
I am very disappointed in this device. I expected a lot based on reviews, but this unit is so inconsistent that it's practically worthless. I'm back in the hunt for a nice, consistent, reliable pressure gauge.	-1
It is a piece of garbage. used it on my engine stand under the engine while I disassembled it. it isn't wide enough to catch everything. also after oil and other, engine related chemicals sat in it for several hours the plastic became pliable and began to stretch and seep fluids through it.	-1
The socket was completely round inside. It would not fit over the sensor. I needed to get the repair done so I decided to use my Dremel and grind it out. I got it to work eventually. I would definitely not recommend this.	-1
First, I didn't buy this item through Amazon.  I believe I got it at a local auto parts store.  If you need a brake spring tool in this style order a Lisle 44800 instead of this Lisle item, the larger one is only a few dollars more.  When I was tightening it up the tip that grabs the spring broke off.  Only difference between this item and 44800 is the size.  If the larger 44800 will not fit I would use a pair of needle nose vise grips.  I like this style of spring tool because there is less chance of burying the hook end of a brake spring in your hand when the needle nose vise grips slip (if you've ever done drum brakes you know what I am meaning.)	-1
I'm a professional technician.  It fits the Sunex stand well. I like it, but It's NOT long enough to be useful for inline 6 engines or long V8's.  I don't, however like the fact that some carburetor or brake cleaners eat the plastic if it sits in the pan for a few minutes.  Mine doesn't hold any liquids now after a week of using it on one engine due to the fact that the plastic is incompatible with common grease solvents.  For the price it should be a better quality.  I'm not going to buy another.	-1
It will not work for newer cars such as 2012 Prius without raising it on stands.  Although the body part of the plastic is only a inch or so from the floor, the head rest is about seven inches off the floor.  If you add another eight inches for your head the total is about 15 inches (1 feet 3 inches) from the floor.  If your car is newer, it is probably lower for aerodynamic reasons.  So you won't be able to slide your head under it, or if you did, your eyes will be uncomfortably close to the under body.  However it is constructed with very good quality plastic and wheels and will work great for higher ground clearance vehicles.	-1
This worked one time, second use the seal slipt in half causing the entire can to leak out. I returned it for a refund	-1
The premise behind these is great and I had an old set from a different mfg years ago. These however wouldn't make a good seal unless I actually held pressure on the thing (R134a). Used them on 4 cans and each one required me to hold them tight to ensure I wasn't leaking by the seal....	-1
Nothing but cheaply made junk. Its so flimsy, it almost broke the first time I tried to clamp it on a can. Also, the "seal" is junk, causing the remainder or the can to leak out, both times it was used. Avoid this product.	-1
Piece of junk. Read through other people's comments of how refrigerant leaks out the side while thinking "this won't happen to me." Guess what. It happened to me. And I've used the cheaper little blue can taps before and never had this problem. I try this one and it not only let's refrigerant escape but creates a crake along the can that sends contents spewing all over everywhere. Do yourself a favor and buy a top loading tap. I was using easy seal at first, lost all the contents, and lost about $50 in an instant. Bought a top loading spout and haven't had a problem since.	-1
DO NOT buy this.  That rubber seal will leak. Basically if you lock the handle in the slots it will leak.  If you squeeze it really hard and hold it, it will leak.  If you buy this plan on squeezing the handle some where between hard and the lock position.  Then holding it very very steady any more or any less and it will leak.	-1
Never Again.. JUNK This thing cost me a lot of money.. I wasted a lot of freon and oil because this thing is good at leaking your expensive product. Dont DO IT.. I just asked Amazon to return this JUNK....	-1
came improperly assembled	-1
I purchased this Milton because they have been around forever and are usually top of the line. Mine sucks! After only 10 uses, the rubber gasket inside came out and now it is useless. I tried to do a return, but as luck would have it, the return period had expired by 3 weeks. Now I can just toss it in the trash. Not that it's a lot of money (about $8) but I never pull $8 out of my pocket and find the nearest trash can. Same difference here.	-1
Lame, check valves inside don't work. Just blows by.	-1
As another buyer stated - THIS IS NOT A QUICK DETAILER - instead it is a cleaner/wax. It should not be called a quick detailer - BUYER BEWARE!	-1
Didnt work, better off going to harbor freight and getting that claw thing	-1
Corkscrew like component to remove upper rope seal from Ford Y 292 block was of no use at all. Seal surface is too small and tool would not screw into it.  I ended up doing a Bubba fix using a very fine concrete screw with a hex end. Used a nut driver to screw it in, attached a pair of vice grips to hex end and pulled hard while rotating crankshaft.  Took several attempts but got the seal out. Next option was to pull engine and crankshaft. Replaced rope seal with neoprene seal.  All well with no leaks.  Suspect in many cases, even using sneaky peak to insert rope seal, you are going to merely stretch it and still not have a non leaking seal. The most effective way to install a rope seal is to pull the crank and pound the upper half into the block securely using a large socket and a hammer.  Better yet, try a neoprene seal first.  Your results may vary.  For sale, one Sneaky Pete cheap.	-1
Item description needs to be clearer. This wrench is clearly for a diesel type filter not for my application. Well made & would definitely fit my needs if it was made to fit small oil filters.	-1
Should have read the reviews, I purchased because it said "quick detailer" knowing that the quick detailer I use all the time (also meguiars) was a spray on version.  Sure, it can be said that "Professional Quick Detailer" is a completely different product than "Quick Detailer", it still serves the job of misleading customers.... 2 stars because of this.	-1
it can't be beat. However, as another reviewer mentioned, the thumb is too large and doesn't fit ball joints with longer threads. The fork also broke after a few uses, so this really isn't a quality alternative to the pricier option. This should be fine if you're doing a couple ball joints. But for frequent use, pay the extra money and get something that'll last.	-1
Did NOT include any instructions at all, much less "full instructions" as claimed. This also does not include the drill bit you need (13/32" drill bit required), and the tap doesn't fit my tap kit, and furthermore there is no information on what size the tap IS so I can buy the appropriate tap kit for it! The tap is labeled as "helicoil M10x1.5" which means nothing since that's the interior diameter of the coils in this kit, NOT the size of the tap. As of now I can't use this until I find a tap extension kit for it, which will be difficult since I don't know the size of the tap or shank. It's bigger than any tap in my kit, and I can't get in there with a basic T-handle.  Bottom line: you need a lot more than this less-than-handy "kit" to complete the job. You're better off buying locally so you can compare sizes at the hardware store and get the bits and tap hardware you need.  EDIT: Also does not include the installation tool guide that other helicoil kits usually come with, in fact the plastic pack it came in looked to have a slot for it, but it had been removed. I don't know if installing without it will be problematic or not.	-1
Buyer beware. When it says made in the USA on the box that is only partly true. I bought this to Helicoil the block for my 1986 Mercedes Benz 420SEL (m116). The tap is made in China and it dulls quickly. I had to Helicoil 36 holes (my arms still hurt). It took five of these as they kept dulling out. I did not use the heli-coils inserts themselves that came as part of the kit. I think they are made in the USA. It's just that the tap is not. At least it is cheap. I bought the same or similar kit from NAPA, ebay and Amazon. All with the same result. They worked in the end but from talking to professional mechanics, I should not have had to buy 5 sets to get the job done. For the record, I was instructed by an experienced professional as this was my first time heli-coiling a block. I used the best cutting oils available. Tap is just Chinese crap.	-1
I had to extract the GM pot metal heater hose coupler after breaking it off when replacing the factory leaker with a steel one from Dorman. This tool just made the hole bigger until it was the size of the remover. The deteriorated pot metal coupler crumbled like a cookie. I had to drill out 11/16" and then 1/2" NPT tap the intake to clear the threads of the old material. Don't waste your time trying to remove all the material from the intake threads as you chance damaging them, let the tap do the work and save yourself hours of frustration!	-1
the new Thexton antifreeze mini tester is cheaply made, not worth the money, it is not near as good of quality as the older ones.	-1
Its a great idea but after the 5th time using it the black knob snapped, making the tool worthless.  The Black knob or handle is plastic, it should be metal.	-1
Not necessarily the fault of the tool, they are offered all over the place.  Probably more the problem that the adhesive holding windshields in place is so hard they are extremely difficult to remove under any conditions.	-1
I bought this item thinking it would solve my problem putting oil in the RV...it is more trouble than it is worth...the spring is strong, therefore you can't hold the can and push the thumb thing a ma jig while the container is full of oil without spilling or slopping the oil...do not like the product	-1
this tool only works on windshields with a soft gasket under them. If you are trying to remove an older windshield with super hard gasket material this tool is not effective. Abrasive wire pulled through the gasket works much better.	-1
The blade is way too short to cut through all of the sealant.	-1
good	-1
the glue line under the windshield of my E46 325i was stronger than this could handle.  Also had a hard time fitting the blade between the body work and the windshield on its lower section	-1
It might work on some softer seals than on my truck, but for urethane glue it is useless.	-1
tried to remove a windshield and the windshield broke even when I was very careful. not a good tool	-1
Didn't work at all.	-1
Plastic spouts is too stiff and causes it to jump out of the fill hole and makes a mess.	-1
Pure junk	-1
I tried every tool in this kit and it didn't really help with my situation at all. They couldn't complete the tasks but it was a cheap kit and could be used for future purposes	-1
Good tool if you are just trying to fix your Triton motor long enough to sell it.  Better solutions are available (at 10 - 20x the cost) for longer-lasting repair.	-1
It made the hole too large for the included inserts to seat properly. Sealant didn't work as the knurled ends of the sleeves couldn't be spread enough to get any traction on the newly-tapped surface.  Huge waste of money. I threw it all away.	-1
Arrived new with paint chipping off. Also clogged out of the box, held pressure without anything attached.	-1
brand new out of the box, it did not work, it did not build up pressure and had a leak somewhere, I thought it was the car, but tried a few cars and all did the same.  I returned it and purchased a moto rad.  The moto rad worked fine.  Stant needs better quality control.  It was frustrating as I spent some time thinking it was the car.  Who would think a brand new stant tester would not work. I guess it happens, but I did not want to try another one, so I switched to moto rad.	-1
Advertised to come with a flex tube.  Even in the "photo".  But NO TUBE AT ALL in packaging....	-1
Junk.  The magnet isn't even strong enough to hold the tool up.	-1
pretty much useless. Doesn't really matter how much you tighten the wing number, the measuring bar will still move.	-1
Quality is the issue. I could not get this tester to pump to 30 pounds. The pump wouldn't seal until I wet the O ring inside with water to form a tight seal. I DID use it to pressure test my radiator cap to satisfaction (leak down test at 14lbs). Even though I could not get it to 30 pounds it sort of seemed to do a proper leakdown test for the radiator. My Pontiac did have a small pin hole hose leak, but you can never be sure with the seal in the pump itself.  Maybe I got a bad one, but even though it has the Stant name on it I wouldn't be surprised if it was made in China or Taiwan or some other foriegn country. Just didn't seem like a professional quality instrument to me.	-1
Not as Pictured .. Cheaply made ..Decal with the measurements fell off right out of the box.. The thumb screw that's suppose to hold it were you set it at , won't	-1
Looks like a nice tool, but the magnet came off on my 1st use of the tool... tried to re glue it nothing seems to hold... kind of waste, should of made away of screwing the magnet to the base... not a very storng magnet.	-1
