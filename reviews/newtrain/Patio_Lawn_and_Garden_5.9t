as advertised!!	1
I tried this right out of the box. I think that it is very good for finding your home property line iron pins. This is so that you know where your lot and your neighbor's lots meet up. The local county survey department wants about $400 to come out and survey a city lot lately, so this would be a savings for sure. Just about any metal detector could find iron pins, but this one was able to pinpoint the pins within 1 inch and wholah! No guessing within a few inches here or there - there they were! 50 years of dirt and grass on top of them was not match for this coil and detector,. Also found a lot of scrap builders nails from the 1960's and 1970's back from when the house was built. I like the different metal discrimination on it.	1
Really nice product.  Were still learning it, but it does seem to beep for junk metal which can be adjusted some.  It's a nice product for the price and so much fun to use.	1
Great price, great product.	1
Ace 250 Metal Detector great lite metal detector	1
these are nice ,  but the basic design and displays  have been around for a long time . garrett makes good stuff ,  and these will be great for your first few years  ( you might get tired of  hunting for crap )	1
I am undecided if this thing really works.  I get lots of false signals everywhere I search, but I did find a nail and part of an old rusted can during my first outing in my back yard.  My property boundary marker pins are no longer visible above the ground, but I located them.  The target pin-pointer and the metal discriminator features are helpful.  The manufacturer recommends using the detector for a year before passing judgment on it's performance.  I guess I need more practice!  UPDATE: After using this metal detector for several months, I have a better understanding of it's capability.  An important key to this understanding is learning to decipher the meaning of the different sounds it produces and how they relate to the type of target located.  A deep pitch tone usually indicates an iron (junk)target, a medium pitch tone may indicate gold, silver, brass or copper while a rapid bell-ringing sound may indicate the target is a U.S. coin.  I continue my 4 star rating because there is no volume control and the sounds emitted are annoyingly too loud for my hearing level.  The pinpoint feature works well, but the artifact depth indication is usually inaccurate.  Overall, this detector does a great job of locating artifacts.	1
as expected	1
Great beginner unit.  I used it on my first day and found some fun coins and am learning what not to dig.  Don't get frustrated, it will take some time getting used to it....	1
I already have one, and bought another for my son. You can't beat the Ace 250 for the money. Great features, and a great price.	1
Nice detector.  I am by no means an expert detector, and I got this for a fun hobby when I have the time to go hunting.  This detector's forte seems to be more dry land, but I got them for use on the beach in dry sand.  Going near salt water will confuse these and give false readings, however we were finding items in dry sand where people lay and set up their blankets.  Every once in a while, our detector started freaking out for a couple seconds, not sure why, but then it calmed down and we resumed hunting.  The display is easy to read and the controls are very simple.  Within, literally, 2 minutes, we were out hunting and finding things.  Not heavy to use which is important when metal detecting for hours, and easily adjusts whenever, wherever due to their being no tools to assemble or adjust.  However, the unit is still sturdy.  Has a built in pin-pointer, though obviously not as good as a handheld one, but if you are on a budget or just looking for a detector with a good time without blowing your bank account, this is a very good starter detecting.  If you are serious about detecting, then I would spend more money and get a better rig.  However, if this is your first detector or you plan to only do this once or twice a week or so when you have time, this is worth the money.  Good all around detector, except in wet sand or water.	1
My mother-in-law loves it.  It's super light, easy enough for my 9 year old niece to use but not cheap either.  The "president" of the local metal detector club (who knew) said he was super impressed with it and wanted to get one for himself.	1
This is a great detector to get introduced into the hobby. I've been using it for about a month and already found some silver and gold. You'll be happy with this machine.	1
I got this as a Christmas gift, and since that time we have been buried in subzero weather and snow.  I haven't had one opportunity to try it outside.  It has given me an opportunity to read all about the detector and likely be more familiar than I would have been.  Knowing myself, I would have turned it on and gone hunting.  I've had the kids hide things in sofa cushions, laundry baskets, under throw rugs, under bed covers, anywhere they might thing would be a good hidden spot.  This much I can say.  Nothing is safe from it while hidden inside.  Found everything within a few moments.  I can't wait to go play in the sand.	1
I have been using and selling metal detectors for over 35 years and in that time I have used most every brand and type of detector. In metal detectors, price is not always the best deciding factor for usefulness. I have have owned some very expensive detectors that this little Garrett would blow out of the water, I have a Minelab that is a piece of junk and has been since I bought it. Metal detecting and detectors all have a learning curve, some very steep others not too bad. This one is not bad at all, if a detector is so difficult to understand and use you will soon find that it ends up sitting at home. I bought this detector for my wife, it is lightweight (important), uses AA batteries (not oddball sizes), sets up very easy, stays in tune, very reliable, and it gets used ! By the way this is the first Garrett I have bought, but will not be the last. Highly recommended for all levels of expertise.	1
My Ace 250 works far better than the way the competition tries to make it look over youtube videos. Though new to metal detecting, we made 6 finds on the day after its arrival when allowing my son to help test it in our portion of an old hay field. Though it has a pinpointing feature that works, I still bought the Garrett Pro-Pointer which tests perfect for faster recovery time when digging.	1
Great metal detector. I purchased a lesser one for my kids to begin with and regretted it. This one rocks for the kids.  First time out my son successfully found an old pocket knife.  I would highly recommend this product.	1
This unit is easy to use and learn. Sensitivity is more than adequate. After reading the manual (you remember those things) i threw a few coins on the carpet to listen for the differences in tone with the difference in size of the object. It was giving me "finds" where I had no coins. Then I remembered, ten years ago when I had new carpet put down, I tightened up the flooring with some nails. It was finding the heads of finish nails under the carpet.  Very nice unit.	1
Now your talking. About time I finally got what I paid for. Quality at a reasonable price and fast delivery. A+++++ All Around.	1
Not to totally rehash everything everyone else said, but basically, ignore the 'Minelab GPX' type snobs - this is NOT a $5000 detector. That said, it can do 90-percent of what one of those can do, and do it well. Why pay that extra $4800?  Seriously, Garrett makes great equipment. If you are into prospecting, like I am, there is ONE THING you will want to buy at the same time you buy this Garrett, and that is a Sniper or Super Sniper Coil. Smaller area, helps you pinpoint small veins of gold easier, especially if you like crevicing.  It will hit it, but the Sniper coil helps you not have to wand a complete rock face a dozen times, trying to figure out if 'you got it out yet', or if it is a phantom or a piece of gold inside the rock face. The Sniper head will help reduce your search time, so you can get back to digging and vacuuming.  Can't recommend the Garrett 250 enough (and the 150 is a great starter unit as well).  Enjoy!	1
Never used a metal detector before. My Garrett 250 arrived from Amazon today. I watched the DVD then took it out to my yard for testing. I got several hits that indicated iron junk then I got 3 hits about a yard apart that indicated a penny at 6 inches. I dug 3 holes and found 3 pennies 6 inches deep just like it said. The pinpointing function worked perfectly. Two of the pennies were nearly dead center in the 4' wide hole and the other was on the sidewall. Color me impressed so far. All of this was within an hour of taking it out of the box. I will update this review as I gain more experience.	1
Haven't found the "big one" yet but it's fun looking. Simple, easy to use and the battery lasts forever. Works great in most areas, but not in the wet sand. Has found fishing lures, coins, a small gold ring and lots of other items. Will most definetly keep you busy.	1
First time we used it it found two pennies, as the detector stated.  It is fun, but will take some practice with the tones as the book states.  Was a Fathers Day gift for my husband.	1
I saw this at my friends house and wanted it for mine.  I really like it but it does take people by surprise when they are not ready to see a face on a tree. It is lots of fun. I would really recommend it. The reason I didn't give it a 5 stars is that my family wants me to take it down and I won't. They think it is silly.	1
Fun! Because of some reviews about squirrels knocking pieces off, I used window caulk as glue on the backs of each piece and it worked nicely!	1
VERY PLEASED	1
Love the glass eyes!  This face added the touch of whimsy that my garden needed.	1
Hanging on my tree, looks like a guy though, olive green not beige as shown.	1
Very fun for the yard	1
I love it, and it's even cuter then in the picture. The seller is great. They shipped right away, and packaged it very safely and securely. It is going to add a lot of personality to my backyard. Thank you!	1
Always enjoy seeing this smiling face on my trees.	1
Good product	1
gift for my neighbor - she loves it	1
Every tree, especially those near a street in town, needs an identity.  Being "just any tree among many trees" is just like a child with a crooked tooth who needs braces.  It harms their self image and makes them feel less appreciated.  So give your trees an Identity with bushy eyebrows, bright eyes, a huge nose and a nice smile.  They will be more productive and will become so popular folks will drive by your house just to salute your trees for their smiles and individuality.  We have blessed three of our street side trees with these smiley forest faces.  A couple of folks have liked them so well they decided they needed them more than did we, verification of their value to the community.  And your grand children will thank you profusely for adorning the trees.  We are on our fifth set of forest faces.	1
Love things that make my yard "happy."	1
It's adorable. I already had one that I bought at Grocery Outlet... and I wanted more. There are lots of different styles. The kissy face is very funny. Had that dopey "I'm gonna kiss you" a lot of guys get at that moment...	1
Now my Avocado tree have a face!!!	1
This is a nice shed. 10' x 14' is ample room. I purchased the shed, floor kit and an anchor kit with four ground augers and steel cable. Delivery was by freight company. The shed itself was all metal, of course, just stacked and layered into a cardboard box. I will leave the packaging feedback elsewhere, but suffice it to say.... they could use a lot better and heavier box. There were holes in the box and several of the panels were dented and scratched. The shipping company did note this and called it in when it arrived. I was a little peeved, but told them I'd accept it as long as the shed assembled without any problems. Assembly was fairly easy, instructions were adequate, and most of the parts were labeled with numbers so you could be sure you were assembling the right pieces. I made the decision to build the shed right on the ground, then install the floor kit with wood floor later. In retrospect I should probably have assembled it on a treated wood base, but instructions said not to let any treated wood contact galvanized metal. I interpreted this to mean there would be a chemical reaction and corrosion could result. You start by assembling the based for the four walls, then square it up. Once square you assemble the wall panels. This is where it gets a little dicey, especially if you live anywhere where the wind might blow. Any good breeze can destroy the shed easily while assembling the wall panels. There is no real support until you get the wall beams and front door frames installed. To make sure the wind would not collapse or crush the panels, I pounded some long stakes into the ground inside and outside the wall panels for support. This seemed to work fine. You don't want to get interrupted or plan to assemble this over a few days time, because wind and weather can tear it up. Be sure you have some help where you need it and don't dawdle. You need to get it built, get the roof on, and get it anchored to the ground before any significant winds kick up. If you can do that you are probably good. The floor kit went in fine and I used a post-hole digger (motorized auger) to put in the ground anchors, packing the dirt tight . Overall this is a nice shed, maybe a little overpriced, but I guess steel is a commodity these days so the price can vary. The shed did assemble without too much trouble, so I did not squawk too much about the shipping damage.	1
Works as advertised. 5 points stopped me from giving this 5 stars. The DIY appeal of this is true but, if you don't have experience building sheds (like my husband and me), you need to be aware of a few things:  1). The instructions were not clear.  There was a little trial and error. Find YouTube video and watch it completely before attempting. TAKE NOTES. 2)  You need to buy the base kit. This will make squaring SO MUCH easier.  There is another kit... be sure you check the FAQs on the Arrow site, so that you have the right one (we had to send one back). 3). DO NOT build this on piers. You need to be on the ground because: a) the base kit is flimsy and b) using pressure treated wood will void your warranted (I'm not sure what else you could use in place if this) 4)  DO NOT use pressure treated plywood for your floor... or will also void your warranty 5). This is a marathon:  a) spend 50% of your time making sure that the ground is level b) after you have the foundation and base assembled, plan on 15 - 20 hours building the shed... try to plan around the weather, so that you can take breaks ve doing this in 1 day	1
This face turned my tree into a person!  It blends great with my maple tree's bark.  I wish I hadn't waited so long to get one.	1
How cute, and so easy to fix -- I used screws and hung the parts on the screws. A nail would do just as well. The tree face is on a very old large tree and is the prefect thing to go with the fairy and gnomes I have there. I have bought another for a different tree. What a good idea, there are different ones to make it more interesting.	1
Listen to me when I say "GREAT INVESTMENT " no bad report with me put walls up and frame in one day, putting roof together tonight. As stands everything lined up and if you read instructions first and take your time you will be impressed with your outcome. Well worth the money you spend, just make sure you have at least one other person that can help put it together, and if you have any scratches or part defects and don't want to send it back after start up, you are covered by warranty make sure you call arrow and send them a copy of your sales receipt.	1
I helped my son assemble a 10 x 12 Arrow shed like this in the fall and two weeks ago the roof completely caved in because of the snow.  It is a total loss and will have to be scrapped and replaced with a wooden shed.  If you already have an Arrow shed I recommend that you spend the additional $250 and get their roof strengthening kit which should be a part of all of these metal sheds.	-1
I got one of these for EACH Grandkid - I let them choose the FACE & then the TREE & then how HIGH to put it. WHAt a great experience (& a memory to return to through the years...) They each remember which one is "theirs"... making that "their tree", too)	1

This is so cute!  But it on a big oak tree in the woods behind my house. Mt grand kids love it. They say it is our guardian angel, St. Bark!  A good conversational part of our landscaping	1
Just what I was looking for. It will be a great gift for my family who liked the on I have.	1

These fine shavings are just perfect for any STOVETOP smoker.  Considering how much I paid for itty bitty tubs from a different company, these are a bargain.  I have gotten into brining and then smoking, and tonight's whole skinned chicken, which I had brined with Italian seasoning and garlic, was smoked with Oak to perfection.  I love how potatoes come out with the skin.  These tubs will last me a while, but once I run low I will definitely be back for more!  Love the flavor selection, you can really taste the difference.	1
my husband loves it	1
I received two pints of Oak when it says I should have received Bourbon!  For this I rate it one star!	-1
Pretty much what it has always been, although this batch of chips/shavings have some irregular larger pieces that don't work very well. Really like the Bourbon Oak flavor.	1
Do not order. Package arrived open. Pieces inside were bent and unusable. For the price I recommend buying lumber. I should have listened to the other reviews.	-1
Okay, let me tell you something, this thing has a ton of bad reviews, don't believe them.  Pros: Was able to assemble most of the shed inside, under air conditioning. Built whole shed in less than a day. Was able to assemble with only a drill, screwdriver, needle nose pliers, hammer, and a hand full of sheet metal screws. You don't have to actually buy the frame kit, you can make your own, I'll explain Will stand up to some nasty wind if you anchor it to a real frame. The Instruction are actually pretty good, IF you read them all FIRST. I can't stress that enough, read all the instructions a couple times before the first screw or bolt goes on, otherwise you're going to be doing things backwards and have to disassemble and start over. You can put some shelves on the high side inside it and get more storage space  Cons: Arrived slightly damaged. The box it was in looked fine, but when opened, stuff had shifted around inside, bending and scraping the paint on several pieces of sheet metal. Box did not contain any Styrofoam protection sheets. Was easy to bend metal back in place, but it doesn't look "Perfect" it looks "Nice." The last few screws didn't want to line up, just used self starting sheet metal screws instead. Not quite as big as I thought it would be once you start loading it. Yea, I did cut myself several times on this project, I don't have work gloves.  Okay hear me out, everyone who says this is amazingly difficult to assemble seems to have just not read the instructions, or have no experience assembling stuff. I built it in less than half a day, the best part, it being summer and the temps were up around 108, because I have wide opening French doors, I was able to build most of it in my kitchen and carry it outside once it got too tall to get through the door. I did need help, but never for me than a few seconds at a time, so my helper would watch Netflix and I could ask for her to hold a sheet for a few seconds while I got a couple screws started. I built my own frame using one 8x4 sheet of plywood and 5 2x4s, I coated them with deck pain and attached the shed to my frame using the Concrete Anchor Kit, I could have done without the anchor kit, but it saved time.  Now a couple pro-tips: Don't worry about keeping square, you will square it up when you're adding the roof panels, if they don't align, you're not square. Wear work gloves when you can (I know you can't start tiny screws and bolts with gloves) If you have a good drill, order a handful of sheet metal screws, and attach the final trim with self-started sheet metal screws, it's a lot faster.	1
It took me a while to put together and really needed help doing that but just what I needed.	1
Like most sheds...  This thing looks cheap and acts cheap, but it's on par with any other sheetmetal shed I've seen/had/put together.  It took two people 3 hours to put together with one screw gun.  All parts were present, the packaging is good, but I had to bend back a couple corners.  The way it goes together, the corners are mostly covered by trim so you can't tell at all.  Just make sure to leave your screw gun clutch super light as these screws will strip the material very easily with a lot of power behind them.  I had to 'fix' zero holes (that is, they were all in the right spot).  Everything you need to know is in the instructions...  Just read them and don't only look at the pictures (even if you're smart).  Pros: Cheap, fits in side yard, single slope roof drains away from important structures.  Light/tough enough to build in big area, then carry to side yard.  All holes surprisingly in the right spots, all hardware present and packaged very well.  Instructions are very good. Cons:  The thing is REALLY ugly (looks like it does in the picture)	1
Exact replacement on the one I ordered almost twenty years ago which, other than the beating it took during a terrible hail storm, sill held it's integrity.  This one took me and a buddy about 6 hrs to build.  Instructions not as bad as some claim, but do take some understanding on assembly.  Overall, with two people it goes well.  I was short one small screw but ended up with a considerable amount of the most common screws left over (better to have more than not enough). If this unit lasts twenty  years as did my first one,  it is well worth the money.  Good for lawnmowers and garden tools, plus I bought and installed a five shelf plastic upright cabinet inside for spray paint cans and misc garden stuff. Unbelievable such seemingly flimsily individual parts become so rigid  once assembly has begun. Intend to spray the top with COLD GALVENIZING spray paint and then cover the gray color with spray paint of matching original color. This should stop rust on the top before it even begins. Nice unit, nice size.	1
well made and easy to assemble	1
I got a variety pack of these different wood chips, but when I smell them I can't tell any difference between the different varieties.  When I cook with them, it just smells like burnt paper and it doesn't really do anything to enhance the flavor of the food.  These chips are ground to the consistency of sawdust, so they burn very quickly.  I bought some coarser wood chips from my local home-improvement store, and found that I actually COULD smell the difference, and I could taste it in my food too.  From now on I will buy the larger chips and just put them in the blender if I need to break them up a bit.	-1
Very good deal. I am glad I got it. The flavored are very potent and specific. Just make sure u match the right chip right meat.	1
Using them for chicken and salmon in my Stove Top Smoker (outside on my turkey gas burner) Always thought smoking was a big bag of wet wood chunks and a huge smoker, now I know that a tablespoon of ground wood works in the same way.	1
great chips good flavor and consistent smoke. they are a little finer grind than i normally use but work well with no waist.	1
I think the chips themselves are great.  I think the price for the small amount you actually gets is really high.  I would not buy these again.	-1
Made steaks taste very smoky	1
Same as my previous review, these tubs contain a generous amount of fine wood shavings that are perfect for STOVETOP smokers.  Love the different flavors, will definitely be back for more although these will certainly last me for quite a while.	1
as advertised	1
Work fine.	1
GOOD SELECTION. CLEAN WITH STRONG AROMA. HOWEVER, BE CAREFUL ON THE AMOUNT APPLIED TO SMOKER. THE SMOKE FLAVOR CAN BE OVER DONE EASLY IF NOT CONTROLLED	1
If you are using these with a Nordic ware Stovetop smoker it only takes a table spoon or two to get nice smoke into a couple of chops, country style ribs of a chicken breast. These won't work with a standard grill unless you have an appropriate attachment.	1
I live in the county and there are a lot of deer about - so having a garden can be a challenge.  My 5 acre unit went bad after two years, so picked up 20 acre model.  One complaint I had about the smaller unit is the deer sometimes push into the wire before it "zaps" them. While they never broke it, it does leave it sagging and needing tightening up periodically. Not with this unit!  After installing it, i walked the fence and discovered one of the insulators arching about 1/2 inch to the frame (way cool!)  Cant wait for the deer to discover this new unit ;-)  PS: before you get upset saying i am mean to the deer, consider my other option to keep them out of the garden is much more.. terminal :-P	1
listen, i don't usually drive people away from amazon, but this product will be an exception. with an item this large and heavy, the shipping cost has got to be built into the purchase price. i would suggest looking at the big box stores. i bought this same shed at menards for $399 and received a $45 rebate during a special, which makes the price a full $235 less than buying it at $589 through amazon. dang.  of course, we all still come to amazon to do product research, and that's why you see reviews here for products that were never purchased here.  at any rate, it's still in the box in my garage, so i will come back and update this review after i put it up in a few days. i actually got to inspect one of these at a friend's house, and it appears very sturdy, roomy and water-tight. i just wanted to let you all know that you should buy this item the old-fashioned way; by driving to the store. and don't forget to take a truck, 'cause this sucker's 250lb heavy and about 3'w x 6'h x 8"d in the box.  ***UPDATE*** so the shed is up. it was not easy to do, and there was a bit of re-fabrication involved, but it's finished. there were a few panels that seemed to be incorrectly pre-drilled, as the screw holes were 3-6" off in some places. also, i'm pretty sure i had a perfectly level surface to build the shed on, but some corners and edges didn't want to square up properly. all said and done, there are a couple places that had to be forced together, but it's a decent shed with a TON of room inside.  now that it's finished, i'm pretty happy with it. however i'm not changing my rating, because of the headache that it became to put it together. also, the kit does not come with an anchor set, so if you're not attaching it to concrete you'll need to buy an anchor set separately. and it's a bit shorter than i had pictured it in my head. at 80" in the peak, i had assumed the door would be nearly 6' tall, but it's actually closer to 5' tall. it's not an issue once you get inside, but i have banged my head twice already.  this shed is still an awesome deal if you can find it at your local hardware store. you'll easily pay double or triple for something a bit heavier or something made of poly. if you need a big shed and don't mind a bit of labor to get one, this thing won't disappoint.	1
I had an 8x10 Newport like this and it is basically an awning WITH NO STUDS IN THE WALLS.  Studs are upright framing members.  I had to build a scaffold around it to erect it as the wind would blow over the stepladder I used to brace it up with. You'll have to babysit the thing until you get it up. Four walls must be up at least and anchored before the wind won't blow it down. This works a hardship on me an arthritic person who built it over a two week period. The wind exploded it with a micro-burst which flung one door into the neighbor's yard and one into the shed, tore em both off, upended it and it landed on the roof all crumpled.  Think of these things as large, dangerous kites which can injure people when loose in the wind. Start by anchoring the floor entirely. Then draw cable over the roof beams as instructed in their plans and anchor both ends to ground. I anchored one end and before I could anchor the other the wind reversed and came at it from the front side and blew it up.	-1

This review is the 10 ft by 12 ft 2016 model.  We bought this shed with high hopes of being able to put our porch full of saws, engine hoists, automotive gear, and old shovels in to get them out of the way. I carefully planned for the arrival by spending $200 on wood to build a floor with 3/4" plywood, 2x4s and 4x4 footers on paver stones. The kids used it as a dance stage for a week before the shed arrived. It was the best part of the whole ordeal.  So the shed arrived and I began putting it together. This was a solo project to start with but you will not be able to do it alone. It takes at least two people to do some portions and three if you want to do it without swearing.  I put the surround down and started on the corners. That's when we noticed that the panels are made from the floppiest tin-foil thick steel you've ever seen. It's like trying to stand up a piece of paper in the wind. If you're careful and it's not windy outside you can get by with doing this part alone by propping the corner pieces up against ladders and boards, anything over 5 ft tall will work. Then you have to tie them all together and it gets easier for a while. If you haven't got 10 ladders or other prop pieces you'll need some friends because if you let go this stuff will bend and fall over onto the ground like a french soldier.  If you make it past that point you can start the cross pieces and get moving forward with some confidence. It took us two weekends (me and a part time helper) to get it put together. Some of the screws don't line up well so you'll have to finagle them to get them in place. Often the pieces aren't shown properly on the instructions either so you think it's right when it's actually flipped around the other direction. If you can't find the hole, flip the piece around and try again. Even if it looks wrong on the instructions.  When wrapping it up and putting the roof on, don't lean on it at all. Use a tall ladder and pray you can reach across the roof to get the top on. This fella is 6'1 and I barely made it. If you lean on it the whole panel will collapse and break through to the floor below - with you following.  Once it's up it looks pretty good. It gets stupid hot inside in the summer, but a white roof might change that. (it's brown now, not like the picture). Just don't lean against the side panels or they'll dent. If a branch drops on the roof it'll collapse. If the kids put their hand on the side and lean they'll dent them. It's just so flimsy that I can't imagine that it'll last. I might have gotten the same protection from buying $100 worth of tarps and just covering my stuff up for 2 years.  My assumption is that it'll last 2-3 years then I'll be forced to tear it all down and build a real shed in there. Guess I better get a book and start learning how to do that.	-1
It is a nice shed. You will need at least 2 people to put up the walls. I assembled all the supports and frame and then got my second hand and it went together quickly. Plan on at least 6 to 8 hours.	1
This is our third Arrow Metal shed and three now that we have assembled ourselves. We bought the 8 x 10 on two different occasions at two different locations and like them. Presently, we have a 8 X 10 set up right next to this one that we set up last year. When we set out to buy a shed, quality and dollar amount are two requirements. We don't want to spend a great deal of money for a shed. For this one, as the smaller one, we like the quality, the sturdiness and the appearance, and the price is right, but the fit and finish on this one leaves a lot to be desired. The fit and finish seem to be a bit haphazard and sloppy in construction compared to the smaller one. Once it is assembled properly, it is very sturdy. Just be sure to anchor it down to prevent heavy winds from tearing it apart. The interior is strengthened by interior bracing around the walls and roof.  The manufacturer sells accessories for it such as attic storage and shelving kits. It isn't framed, but it is internally braced. With this model, you get everything to assemble except for a floor and anchoring kit. For us, this one came with the floor frame kit, but the kit is not that good. We just put ours up. The floor frame does not fit properly as advertised or as per instructions. You need to be able to plan it out ahead of time in order to properly assemble the floor frame. You need to lay out the entire shed in order to assemble the floor frame properly in order for it to fit the shed. For us, we set a plywood floor on this floor frame kit. This shed was delivered in one heavy box that was about four (4) feet wide by eight (8) tall by about four (4) inches thick and weighs about two hundred pounds. For assembly, my spouse was able to lay the floor frame down, the floor and do a lot of putting braces together without my assistance over the course of eight hours. For the rest of it, it took two of us to put up the walls and roofing and then spouse was able to finish the rest: the doors, etc. without me. All in all, it took us about a total of sixteen to twenty hours to completely assemble on a calm, windy free day. Whatever you do, don't try to set this up with the slightest breeze. Overall, this is a great little shed for not a great deal of money if you can look past the fact that it isn't perfect. It comes with a great deal of screws and plastic washers (you need them to prevent water from getting inside) that will drive you crazy. If you can, spend some time putting the washers on the screws ahead of time. Other than that, we have no hesitation in recommending this handy little affordable shed to anyone else. We live down in the deep south where strong wind and rain and tornadoes happen on a regular basis. This shed with just the anchors we set in the ground that we purchased separately;, this shed isn't going anywhere. The smaller shed we set up last year has the same anchors and has survived lots of storms and is still standing tall.	1
What you have to do is follow the instructions.  You need three eight-foot long grounding rods, pounded into the ground and distanced from but connected to each other; and, of course, connected to the Magnum 12.  I used four rods, just to be sure.  Then I ran a wire from the "hot" Magnum 12 connection to the fence wire.  Next, I let the thing sit with the switch turned off for about 10 days, because we were locked into a partly-sunny/partly-cloudy weather period.  When I turned it on, it still only appeared to be about half-charged.  But I knew it should be charged, so I checked the fence.  And sure enough it was shorting out at one place.  I corrected that and the charge indicator jumped like crazy to full charge.  We've had a number of cloudy days since but the unit has stayed fully charged.  And let me tell you, that thing will pop you a good one if you touch the wire.  Now I have a critter-free garden and could not be more pleased.	1
Would be four stars or more if it had arrived when it was supposed to . Its late arrival prevented the rest of my project from moving forward and cost me more than I paid for the fencer  Wish this fencer was available to me locally because it really is a awesome product !	-1
Worked great the first two growing seasons but developed some bizarre behavior the third year. Normally, it would pulse about once a second, but all of a sudden, it began to pulse about twice a second. It then reverted back to it's original pulse rate. Now, it changes back and forth between the two without warning. I have tested the charge during both of its moods and have found no change, so it is still doing the job its designed for, which is keeping critters out of the garden!	1
good product, works great	1
Powered three fences without a problem.  Great product.	1
Works fine	1
very good quality product works great best charger I have had yet	1
This my second Parmak Magnum. The first one got trashed by a mouthy horse when it was turned off. The first one lasted almost a decade. I was working on my fence and inadvertently hit to wire. Oh yeah! This baby bites. When the horses even get near they get suspicious. Love the solar as can use it without electrical access. No fence pushers in my pasture.	1
High output. I can ground the output and still get a spark, with a grounded screw driver, half way along the same wire. Other than the 'clicking' I like it.	1
So now I've had a whole summer of using this fencer and I am so glad I bought it. I have the worst fence, my wire is near the ground to keep the cattle from nosing under my fence, which is the reason we put up electric in the first place. I've got a nasty weed load, and a long way to string that wire, and this fencer handles it all. Even though I never got back out to hit the ground beneath the wire with Roundup like I said I would, it's still hot even with a heavy weed burden all along the whole fence. My cattle don't even go near the fence any more, which is a relief since I keep a bull and the neighbor has cows too. I promise I'll get to that Roundup tomorrow.....maybe.	1
works great for the money	1
I have a 2k lb brangus bull pushed the fence down on my east perimter and went bext door to have his way with the cows next door. Once i installed this unit took like 15 minutes to install the unit itself. Also installed two 8ft ground rods10 ft spacing. Using dbl strand 15.5 gauge smooth wire at 48" high 1/4 mile long. Tested the actual voltage on line it is 8,650 volts. The gauge on the unit is pegged off the 10k scale. The bull now respects the fence even though he has a burning desire to get to the friendly girls on the other side. The shock gets his attention. He now just breeds my cows. Great unit you will be impressed with the power, unit looks solid, typical of the parmak brand	1
DANG! Great price on a great charger.	1
Works as advertised	1
Do not buy this item via mail-order. Batteries are considered "hazardous material" so you cannot send it back....I'm stuck with a very expensive $300 yard ornament!  This is a time I should have gone to the local dealer.....  Update: After opening the unit up and checking the wiring and leads from the solar charging module, it turns out that the negative lead that hooks to the battery was defective. A new lead connector installed... the Parmak Magnum 12 Solar fence charger works like a champ.  However lesson learned!!  Buying products with large batteries (hazardous materials) could become an expensive problem to solve.	-1
This particular charger has a loose fitting 12 volt battery inside, which is only supported on it sides by cardboard.  So, YES, it appears to have something loose inside; however, use a flat blade screwdriver and pop the top off and you will see what I mean.  I took out the cardboard and inserted foam, but fiberglass insulation will work and so will small PVC.  Now, as for operation, I only have a third of an acre in which I mounted two 12.5 gauge aluminum charger wire strands near the top ( but below the top rail ) on the inside of a six foot commercial quality chain link fence.  Okay, so maybe it is overkill (no pun intended), and while the analog meter on the face of the charger is pegged over the 10,000 volt mark. WOW . . .  but not to worry that is not a bad thing.  The chain link fence acts as ground and has much better conductance than a dozen ground rods.  OCTOBER 27, 2013 UPDATE: Okay its been three months now and this charger has been kicking butt the whole time.  I've added lightning protection measures and additional lengths of 12.5 gauge aluminum fence wire too.  Meanwhile I leaned against the top strand of wire with my left ear and face while cutting grass and was surprised (shocked) that the loud (KAPOW) hit of electricity I received did NOT burn me, hurt me or leave any trace of my carelessness.  Oh yeah, my pitbulls no longer try to climb the fence and have resolved themselves to a life at home.	1
I just had to order a new battery pack for this ($60 on Amazon) to replace the original battery after 10 years of reliable excellent service.  The charger still worked as long as the sun was on the solar photo voltaic cell, but the battery terminal had corroded and stopped the circuit for battery.  This unit uses a battery to power the fence when solar is not enough, then the solar keeps the batter charged.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give this 6 joule knock your arm out its socket charger a 12.  Its two better than the best.  I have 3 fence chargers (different pastures) and this one by far is the best, most reliable, and most powerful.  I contain horses with HORSEGUARD Fence brand fencing, and the horses will take only one "bee sting" from this fence charger and they will respect it forever.  They would graze under the fence by getting on their knees but would keep their ears flat so as not to be "bitten" by the fence.  That proves they respect it, but are not fearful of it which any horse owner knows is extremely important.	1
The strap was great - easy to wrap round two good trees and supported the hammock great for a year Then just today we went on it for the first time in a few months and it snapped, delivering the two of us unceremoniously to the ground.  Luckily none was hurt but actually this could have been dangerous.	-1
very strong and easy to install	1
Just what I needed to put up our hammock.  Work well.	1
Did not work for us....Amazon was gracious enough to refund the money even though the return period had passed. It moved down the tree; the fabric/stitching seemed of poor quality, and difficult to adjust to tree size. Bought another brand that was adjustable which works great.	-1
gift for someone	1
Talk about durable!  Very busy family here.  Put these up, they've been on the trees now for like 2 years now.  We've taken the hammock down for storms or for the winter but never these.  They still work great, no problems even after being exposed to month long 100+ degree weather, 20 degree weather, the pine trees swaying through storms AND a lightening strike!  These poor things have been abused so much but takes it and keeps working like a champ.  I'll never use any other brand.  You can't go wrong with these I assure you!  We've also only had to adjust these once due to normal weighing down from family use.	1
Excellent! I recommend it!	1
One end was not sewn for the loop. It was folded by the machine I guess, but the machine must have run out of thread? We "fixed" it by tying a knot, but that was not what I paid for. I didn't send it back because once I got it up in the tree, VS taking it down and packing it back up...pain, with guests coming to the lake for the weekend... They do work.	-1
Quality product	1
These worked great for hanging our hammock between 2 trees.	1
Straps work well.	1
these made hanging my hammock on two palm trees a breeze, no tools necessary! I had bought these and a hammock together and had them up in less than 10 minutes and laid down to relax!	1
These worked good and are well made- but I had a larger tree to put this around and it was not long enough to wrap it around twice. But I could not find anything longer (without it being commercial lifting straps).	1
Perfect for hanging a hammock. Generous length allows a greater distance between trees if needed or you can wrap multiple times to take up the slack as needed. I use these with my pawleys island hammock that travels with my 5th wheel RV. Take less than 5 minutes to put up the hammock on just about any campsite with two tress unless that are too close or way to far apart. Worthwhile investment!	1
I'm going back and forth between 4 and 5 stars.  Once these are up, they worked great.  But putting them up was not easy.  The directions are hard to follow and don't work as easily as it looks.  I think we had to "make it up" and do what worked.  Now they are up all the time and sturdy and hold the hammock well.  But it took many tries to get the tree spacing (which 2 trees to use) and height just right.  So actually, I'm glad we used these straps.  I'd hate to drill holes in my tree, just to learn I need to put them up 6 inches higher!  The straps make it flexible without damaging the tree, for sure.  I would buy again.  My only criticism is that I wish the directions were more clear.	1
Work great and hold up to the weather	1
Perfect for our hammock chair	1
They are a little difficult to learn how to use, but there is a video on the website that helps. After a year they are still holding strong.	1
Easy to use and set up to hang my hammock.  No problems at all holding a big guy like me.	1
A little hard to remove at the end of the season because it was all tight BUT with a little effort we removed from the tree.  Worked great all season long.  Loved it.	1
LOVE IT	1
There's nothing like laying in a hammock during the spring, summer and autumn. These straps are sturdy and so easy to put up.	1
Exactly as advertised, they work great.	1
Worked but then failed. The stitching gave way and failed miserably. Waste of money.	-1
Great item better than putting hooks in trees.	1
we used it to hang the hammock but had to to inventive methods to tie the hammock to the patio.	1
They're quite long ... plenty to wrap around even the biggest of back-yard trees ... perhaps 3-4 times for smaller diameter trees, with still plenty of extra strap for reaching the hammock rings.  They seem plenty strong and well made.	1
Poor quality.  The first time we used the straps, one of them tore.  They are still usable, but make me extremely leery when I use my hammock.	-1
These are good, strong, easy to assemble tree straps for a hammock. The color blends into the tree wood so all you see is your hammock, inviting you to swing away the afternoon in the dappled sunshine...	1
We use these to hold up our tarp between two trees. They work good and you can adjust them easily.	1
Admittedly I set up my hammock haphazordly with these straps. Which, I do not reccomend, but it worked out perfect. I am a small female and was able to tie the straps and attach them to my hammock myself. The hammock held tight in place. My friends also laid in the hammock and it still held strong with the weight on a man weighing down on it. I definetely recommend these straps. I was a very happy camper and am sure I will continue to be the next time I am able to set up and use my hammock. :)	1
The brown looks natural on trees. I am very pleased I do not to have to put hooks in trees. Holds hammock very nicely.	1
I bought these with a Hammocks Rada hammock - perfect combo.  Easy to install, strong, easy to take down.  The nylon webbing is wide, long and strong.  The hooks are strong and won't bend.  Highly recommended.	1
Purchased as a Mothers Day gift with Texport La Paz Hammock. First day three grand-kids put it thru the strength abuse test lol. I was watching them all swing in the hammock and play and was saying to myself, if this hammock survives this it can survive anything. We leaves the straps up but take hammock down in the rain. So easy.	1
The product I got was different from the one pictured here but better!  Instead of a ring and S hook, there was a just a hook - that solved any concern about the hammock coming loose ( I would, of course, suggest the open part of the hook to point upwards). I don't plan to get carabiners. One suggestion: the instructions said to put the straps 4.5 ft from the ground. Our hammocks are stretchy, so we had to move the straps up higher.  However, the straps are very easy to put up and take down, and the instructions were easy to follow. It was easy to adjust the length to fit whatever diameter tree or distance between trees. With two people (one at each tree), it was simple to make changes to get everything "just right." No damage to the trees.  No slippage.  Held perfectly with two adults or several squirmy pre-teens.  The hammocks were such a hit with the kids, I'll probably buy one or two more, and this is the strap I plan to buy again.	1
these are great . without these I could not have put up my new hammock. If you are going to put up a hammock between two large trees you will need something like this.	1
I ordered these to hang a hammock and hammock chair. They were easy to use and strong with little to no stretching. Both my trees and I love them.	1
I love my hammock, but did not like putting huge bolts in my trees to hang it. It was a little challenging to get the placement right as they stretch a little (i'm 200+ lbs), but they hold well and don't hurt the trees.	1
i had to tie it around the tree a few times but it holds nicely. have used it with close to 500 lbs of people in a hammock and it held with no issue.	1
I have owned my Pawleys Island Tree straps for over a year now. I have taken them with me on many hiking excursions into the mountains and whatnot. My primary use is for primitive camping via hammock. I like to travel ilght. I chose the Pawley Island straps because of the rugged make of their product. They have solved an age old hammock strap problem for me. They have little or no stretch. How many of you have experienced stretched tree straps. You know, where you start the night off at the perfect tension laying almost flat, but then wake up an hour later almost folded in half almost touching the ground because your tree straps have stretched. Not so with the Pawley Island straps. They maintain their position wihtin 1 to 2 inches. As far as ease of use, I can have my hammock up in 5 minutes or less. Depending on how tired I am when I get to camp. Regarding the comments on the "S" hooks. I use an Eagle's Nest hammock and they come standard with really well made steel carabiners, so I have honestly never used the "S" hooks. My one and only negative comment would be that the straps are a little on the heavy side, but I'm willing to give them that since they do such a great job. I would recommend these to any camping fanatic, like myself.	1
I purchased the straps to avoid bolting the hammock to our trees. When I gave the hammock and straps to my husband I told him about a review I read that suggested replacing the S hooks with carabiner clips.  He opted to replace the S hooks with chain quick links instead.  The quick links were cheaper and weight rated higher. With that one change the straps work very well.	1
These worked great to secure our hammock around palm trees. The product is great since drilling holes in these trees kill them. They are adjustable, and also portable so we can use them to hang the hammock during Rv trips.	1
I used both straps strung together on a very large tree in our yard.  The hammock is hung and the tree is undamaged.	1
The straps are a MUST HAVE for your hammock! 5 star review, sets up in minutes, does not harm tree!	1
We had previously held our hammock up with chains.  These straps made it so much easier to hang the hammock and adjust it to the height we wanted.  Very happy with these.	1
Versatile, well constructed, durable appearing, and long enough to handle a variety of trees or posts.  Designed to work, heavy duty hardware.  So far, I am impressed that price-value is good.	1
I recently was given a Pawley's Island Hammock, and rather than stress a tree, and wanting an easier way to hang the hammock instead of driving in bolts, I purchased these straps.  The straps are sturdy and are easy to wrap around the tree, and they hold well.  I have given this a four star rather than a five star rating because I believe a carbiner rather than the S hooks which come with the product, would be a better attachment.  Otherwise, this product works as advertised.	1
I've yet to figure out the best 'wrap' for around the tree, but most any will do.  The directions leave me clueless.  However it works for the intended purpose and appears sturdy and long lasting, a keeper.	1
This is a very nice hammock and a great price. It's a Pawleys Island hammock which are the best made. You can see that it is very well made . The colors are true to the picture, it holds two adults comfortably and it dries very quickly.	1
I bought this hammock four years ago and I wish I had dealt with this problem sooner.  Be aware: there is only a one year warranty on this hammock.  The problem we had is that the spreader bars rotted out after the first year.  I could see that the finish was thin and starting to wear but I did not do anything about it.  Now it is moldy and completely eroded and unattractive.  The ropes which are red on our hammock are also faded pink.  We live in the Northeast and have the hammock out from June through mid October.  I took pictures and sent them to Pawley's Island and they responded: too bad, only 1 year warranty and here's the link to buy replacement parts which are very expensive.  I do not recommend this brand.  it is overpriced and not well made.	-1
A father's day gift for my husband and he absolutely loved it.  I have enjoyed resting in while reading and also watching birds as I looks up.	1
I don't normally write reviews but just had to on this product, hands down the best hammock I've ever owned.  Looks great, comfortable, high quality material, it's just awesome.  Highly recommended!!!!	1
It is nicely lightly padded, great colors, it IS solid green (forest) on the underside, I didn't know this, but it's totally fine with me. It comes with the S hooks ready to install into a tree, but you need separate S hooks if you want to use it in a hammock stand, due to the ones provided being clamped onto screw. (not separate) No big deal, I will get some at hardware store. It does have a lil more "green" than the pic portrays, maybe about 1/2 green. The red woven part looks sharp and is so much smarter than beige (typical) that shows dirt! Can't wait to chill in it.	1
I just put up the hammock and it is just what I expected. My first hammock lasted beyond 20 years and this one appears to be of comparable quality. Heavy duty hardware looks like it will stand up to the weather. The fabric is soft and comfortable. An unexpected bonus was one-day shipping, thanks!	1
This is my fourth exact same patio rug...........I must have bought my first one four years ago.  Honestly, the amazing thing is that my newest one (same pattern, colors ~ different size) I just got this week, looks almost EXACTLY like my oldest one.  My Dad is rolling in his grave to hear me say "almost exactly", a phrase he always hated!)  Anyway, these rugs wear extremely well.  Unbelieveable really.  Mine have lived outdoors in all seasons........they get wet, they get dry, the sun burns down on them and they freeze.  NOTHING seems to phase these fabulous rugs.  I have an ugly concrete patio and would love to have pavers, but can't really afford them.  These rugs have made my patio disappear and I love the way they feel on my always bare feet!  One additional thing I've noticed about these rugs;  the dirt sifts through them.  When you pull them up you will be astonished at how much dirt and dust has accumulated under the rug!  I have very active dogs and they haven't hurt the rugs at all!	1
The delivery and quality was exceptional. Was very pleased and will do business again with this company. Like the thought its made out of recycled plastic bottles so its perfect for outdoors. The pictures do not do the colors justice, and with both sides with different patterns, you choose what fits your decor. Ended up buying another one, and have told people about this rug.  :)	1
THIS IS MY THIRD ONE! BEST PRODUCT FOR DOGS TO CLEAN OUTSIDE!!!! AND BEAUTIFUL!	1
thin, thin, thin.	-1
The recycled plastic rug is fab. After reading the reviews, I was concerned by outrageous colors. No one that I could see posted a photo of the Brown and Yellow, so heres one. I tried to incorporate colors to illustrate the actual shades of the weave. There is subdued Yellow. The brown is strong & dark. The light blue accents offset the other colors. It works beautifully on our deck. I am too lazy to turn it over for a photo of the reverse side. The colors on the other side are too dark for my deck decor.  The rug is lightweight, and it will flatten out once the sun returns July 4, 2018 . I am appreciative for a great way to use recycled plastic.	1
So cute on my front porch!!!!	1
Returned these. Pretty but hard on the feet and very expensive for what you get	-1
I had been coveting this mat for months. I finally caved and made the purchase. I'm glad I did. It's so beautiful and it has some wonderful features...  It's made from high grade recyclables It's weather proof It's UV protected and fade proof It's durable It's breathable and it won't mold It's reversible! Both sides are very colorful.  I love how this mat feels on my bare feet; it's super soft. I've sprayed it off with a hose several times. It includes velcro pieces for securing, but I haven't used them. It will brighten up any space. I just adore it.	1
We have 2 dogs and 3 cats, fiber area rugs don't work for us! Have one in the living room and another in the kitchen (different pattern) Pros: * SUPER EASY TO CLEAN - we use a steam mop and it's done. No bacteria gets trapped in the fibers, like a regular area rug. No stains either! * Lightweight. * Reversable. * long lasting * stunning colors * looks like bamboo * pet/spill proof!!! CONS: * Ends can buckle..easy to fix, just weight down with something heavy for a few days.  That's it! Awesome rug.	1
junk	-1
Looks great, easy to clean, Love it!!	1
Vibrant colors, good quality.  A bit pricey for the size.	1
Very exotic, vibrant colors, great value!	1
Luv it!  I was tired of yearly buying patio rugs that said they do not mold nor mildew.  They always did.  Then, I found mad mats!  I just finished my third year with the Mad Mats on my patio, and even leaving them outdoors all winter long, I will get at least one more year from them.  I have had so many compliments on them, too.	1
I thought this was going to be too bright but it looks great with my camper van.  Placing this outside keeps the inside of the van clean, and the rug is sturdy, light, and cheerful, and easy to shake out before heading home from the campground. My traveling companion likes it too!	1
I rarely write reviews, but as I buy my 3rd mad mat, I thought I should. I love the added color these mats add to our patio. We live in southern california, so the sun challenges the color and integrity, but our mats have lasted a good 2 years. We have one laying directly outside our glass French doors visible from our kitchen area. The color helps blend our inside colors out to our patio chairs. The colors have withstood the sun, our dogs, water, and after many other outdoor mats, these don't hold water when it rains so you can wipe your feet and enter. Love these mats and trying a new design this time!	1
Beautiful rug <3 Thank you for great service <3	1
Was not what I thought, but works ok.	-1
I purchased this mat three years ago. I leave it out on my concrete patio year-round, through the heat of summer and snows of winter. This mat has survived hurricanes, floods, and my obnoxious cat. It continues to remain resilient, and colors vibrant. I am back to purchase another for my new home front porch. Highly recommend.	1
looks great	1
Best outdoor rugs on the market, hands down.	1
Looks great on the deck, love the colors, and it's very practical.	1
this is made of a plastic material that is almost like a close line. the colors fade with in a week of being in the sun for only a few hours, not worth the money at all.	-1
Saw this last year and just bought it. Fun design, not like the other patio mats, lots of color. Put on patio and had to buy matching cushions. Makes an impression. These mats last forever. The only wearing happens under my rocker.  This one is turquoise, but the black and white looks elegant. Update a few weeks later: This looks so nice, also bought the 4x6 and runner.	1
I am THRILLED with this 4X6 Turquoise mat. Ordered it this morning and it was on my door step by 7:30 PM.....same day. The colors are vibrant and stunning. Would like to cover my entire back patio with these mats.  For now, it is one eye catching accent piece which transforms a bland concrete floor. Comes securely wrapped in good quality plastic, rolled around a 6 foot heavy duty cardboard tube. Says "Absolutely No Maintenance required." What could be better than that! Love the vibrant colors and pattern. Why settle for a basic brown or green rug when you can add this much life? I cannot stop looking at it.	1
Just as pretty in person as it is on the photo.	1
Put this mat under the table on the patio by the pool, I get compliments on it all the time. I overlooked the fact that it was plastic when I ordered it and wasn't sure I was going to like it but I do. It dries quick and looks nice.	1
Love it! Perfect for our indoor living room. It is very easy to keep clean, even with dogs and cats. Looks great too!	1
great rug	1
Very Pretty and durable.  Took it to put down in tent when camping and easy to pick up and shake off.  We now have it on an outside porch u till next camping trip!	1
I love this rug!  I was going to get a mat for in front of my kitchen sink, but I saw this and even though it was about 3x the size I was looking for, I bought it anyway.  It's in a high traffic area in my kitchen, and I have dogs and humans tromping through, and it doesn't move around much.  I don't even use the adhesive things that came with it.  It really brightens up an area.  It doesn't look like it's made of plastic at first glance, but its amazing the colors that are in this thing. I can vaccuum it and mop it, whic is great for when im feeling lazy and don't want to move it.	1
Love this rug!! Beautiful color and looks  like an expensive oriental. I have two dogs and had to replaced a rug because they still have accidents. When my dogs make a mess all you have to to put some soap on a paper towel and wipe it up. I use this rug in my entry way and have received many complements!!!	1
Very nice, light plastic mats that held their color over the summer in glaring sun on a south facing deck. Light weight and easy to roll up and put away when done for the summer. I have had heavier rattan like mats on my deck and I much prefer these. The dirt just brushes off or blows off. I will store them inside for the winter, but they will be back next spring.	1
Love the fact it's made out of a plastic material and won't mildew on my screened in porch!	1
Vibrant colour and intricate detail. Looks great	1
Love my rug!	1
Not really rust colored, but I love it anyway.  Pattern is oriental, but it is flat woven recycled plastic.  It will move around, but it came with corner Velcro fasteners.  I did not use them as I will roll it up when there is too much action on our front porch.  I was out to define a small sitting area and this mat did just that, inexpensively and who would not want  "MadMat" in their life?	1
Does not fade in the brutal, direct summer sun. Looks exactly like the picture.	1
My mat is about 6 years old on my patio in Florida.  It's abused by the sun and constantly walked on with sandy feet.  Still looks new!  Not even fading!  This thing will last forever and looks very nice and classy on the patio.  It does not even hold dirt or sand.  It never looks dirty.  Absolutely great.  It's sort of like a mat made out of plastic straw.	1
Love this rug!!!  I have been eyeing it for quite some time and finally broke down and purchased it. Kind of expensive but well worth the price. I got the aqua rug. The colors are vibrant and it lends a whole new upbeat vibe to my kitchen.  It is one of a kind. Lays flat and easy to clean.	1
love it	1
Lots of compliments on this floor covering. I use it inside in front hearth (summer) or outside under the table. Very pretty, striking.	1
This rug is absolutely beautiful!  Can use it inside or outside.  It just arrived, so can't vouch for it's durability yet.  Fingers crossed.	1
I was very skeptical when ordering this Mat/Rug. It looked great online, but I was concerned if it would be as nice it seemed pictured. It is Better! Colors are beautiful. I purchased the rust and it has shades of dark red, orange and green. The recycled plastic lays flat ,feels good on your feet and stays in place. I have some furniture on top of mine so there is no movement. The Mat does come with peel and stick pads if needed, but they are not necessary. Cat and dog hair do not stick to it like an ordinary rug, you can blow everything off with a leaf blower. It is a perfect rug(mat) for an outdoor patio or sunroom. It does look just like a rug, but better for any outdoor area. I am surprised there are a few negative reviews on this item. I am very picky and I am very pleased with this perfectly designed outdoor Rug . It is also a plus that it is completely made out of recycled plastic.	1
Had to return as this rug was very slippery and slid on deck, This elderly one does not need to fall..	-1
Beautiful and practical. I have one on the back deck and one in my office.	1
bright colors	1
This is a GREAT product and so far it has stood up to rather severe winter weather.  The color patterns are vivid and many droppers-by have commented about the carpet...worth the money to get the real thing.	1
We were really impressed with this. Colors were identical to the picture. We put it in the kitchen and it's easy to clean and really brightens it up	1
As usual, Mad Mats are the best! Beautiful, durable pet and child proof and cost effective..	1
I have had mine outside for two years.  It has held up pretty well to the elements.  In the Winter, I just rolled it up and laid it at the front of my porch behind the railing.  So, it really is weather resistant.  Very vivid colors.....	1
This mat is in our entryway.  It gives off a formal look but will likely stand up to wet shoes and mud due to being made of synthetic material.  It is very, very light and moved around quite a bit on our tile floor.  We needed to put plenty of rug gripper underneath to keep it in one place.  Several people have commented that it looks very nice.  I would have liked to have paid less for it but my opinion might ultimately change if it holds up longer than a traditional rug.	1
What a great rug for patio and door entrance. We spent several thousand fixing our patio entrance. People compliment this rug more than anything else	1
Easy to clean, gorgeous colors!  It's not carpet but is comfortable to walk on. It was on sale and the company had a first time buyer discount so the price was right, too!	1
Finest thing added to our patio since it was poured 15 years ago. We bought 2 and it feels like an outdoor room and not just a patio.	1
This mat works well as a stylish addition to our camp, helps keep the dust down.  Used in a high traffic walking area, not a sitting area where chair legs would be a problem.	1
Just got these rugs and what a transformation of my terrace! Even though they are obviously plastic when you feel them, the weave feels great underfoot and they look great. I just ordered another one	1
I am using this in my kitchen (yes inside) that is yellow and blue and it's REALLY neat. Very bright and pretty. I had a sisal mat in there and it just got dirty and nasty very fast. This is clean and bright, easy to move and clean up. Best part...I can take it outside and HOSE IT OFF!!! if it gets dirty. At first it was kind of slippy so you might want to put a rug mat under it.	1
I just received this rug yesterday and so far I'm really happy with the quality.  The colors are just like the picture and I posted another photo as well. It is made from recycled plastic (not fabric, so the colors won't fade) and it feels thick and durable.  It also comes with some adhesive attachments so you can make it stay put on your patio or deck (note: the directions say that in order to remove these adhesive pieces once you use them you have to use paint thinner to remove them).  I haven't used the adhesives yet, but I'm very pleased with the rug and I can't wait to see what my balcony looks like after my patio furniture arrives.	1
This is beautifully colored but it is PLASTIC. Do not be fooled I to thinking this is a rug that's soft by any means. It's gonna go outside once summer comes because it doesn't look right indoors.	1
We have two homes.  Both have mats on the outside deck/patio.  One place is barraged by rain, the other by strong sun.  The mats in both places have held up beautifully and show no wear despite the oldest ones being several years old.  I receive many compliments on these mats.  They do blow around in the wind but are lightweight enough that they can easily be rolled up and put out of the way.	1
This mat will work perfectly for us in front of our hot tub.  It's soft on the feet and I don't worry about leaving it out in inclement weather.  The colors are natural looking and goes well with our woodsy dcor.  I attached the Velcro strips to the decking and it has stayed put.  I like this idea as I will be able to lift it up to shake out or sweep beneath it.  The item was delivered promptly and even a couple days sooner than expected.  It is very expensive looking but I feel I got a good deal.  Would highly recommend to others.	1
Just received this yesterday and put it on my porch.  It is MUCH prettier in person than in the picture.  I am absolutely thrilled with the way my porch looks with this rug on it.	1
Stunningly gorgeous outdoor floor mat. Great colors, made for outdoor life. Put it under out bench, Love it! Seems to be fade resistant so far.	1
I use mine at the side of my pool with my chairs and where the ladder is works really good.thinking of purchasing a second one.	1
I wanted a colorful outdoor mat for our front screened porch.  Online this appears yellow and turquoise and I thought it would fit the bill. It is difficult to find outdoor mats in this size that are not neutral in color.  While I wasn't really wanting the "oriental" look I was after the colors.  When I first opened the package I was disappointed that it was a very dark color.  It is woven with Navy and Dark Green strands that when combined gives a "teal" not "aqua" look. It is an illusion. There is not one "aqua" color strand in this entire mat.  However the mat is well made and is a good value for the money.  After a while the color has grown on me and I don't dislike it as much.  However, the one I received does not look as nice in coloration as the photo.	1
An excellent buy at a very reasonable price. Doesn't have the cheap look of most plastic mats, and is far more substantial so it should last even here at the beach with the sun and heat.	1
I liked this rug but it just didn't go with my place the way I would have liked it to. It says indoor/ outdoor but I don't think think the plastic feel works well in areas like living rooms.	1
Receive rug and at first didn't know if I would like it cause it is made out of  plastic. But is has held up great for three months. And the colors are beautiful.	1
Even better than I expected.  Really bright, colorful rug- is plastic but you would never know it unless you had your eyes inches away.  Soft under bare feet- a little cushy- perfect for covering my ugly concrete porch.  One side the feature color is aqua- on the other it is a deep gold-  hard to choose which is more beautiful. Now that I have it I am thinking of other places I could use one- honestly these would even be nice somewhere indoors. Love!	1
It's not a carpet or rug; it's a mat.  It's a woven plastic mat.  That understood, it really is beautiful and very strongly built.  It takes all kinds of punishment and cleans like a breeze.  We have it in an inside patio area and it brightens up everything and always looks clean.  Friends of ours want it, too.  Understand what it is, but it is probably about the best of what it is, too.  We'd buy it again and might do so for another area next summer.	1
Great tool for pruning.  Hefty weight, but easy to use.  Well balanced, sharp. Used it to pull and cut weedy roots, as well as lop off suckers from trees and bushes.  I emailed seller for honing stone and sharpening oil, but got no response, and that was many months ago.	1
Great birthday present from my wife.  It's found a home next to my firewood pile.  I'm looking forward to some dire situation where I can use it to save the world!!	1
Classic and cool! Can't break it!	1
This is a well-built tool. You can tell just by the feel.	1
I bought this Woodsman's Pal because, as a knife and machete lover, I felt I had to have one. What I've learned over the years of owning it is that it's more than just a good-looking machete: it's actually a fine tool that I use on a regular basis. So what is the Woodsman's Pal good for and what is it not good for?  GOOD FOR   The hook is excellent for stripping limbs off small, fallen trees.   The back edge makes an excellent point of contact for a fire starter.   The blade itself is excellent for chopping off limbs and hacking down small trees. This blade is heavy enough that you can really do some damage.   I've also used the flat side many times for pounding in stakes and flattening hard ground.  NOT GOOD FOR   Hacking through tall grasses, bushes, and the like. I've tried to use my Woodsman's Pal as an all-purpose machete, but it's just too short and stout for that kind of thing.   Nothing can replace a good axe, and this Woodsman's Pal is no exception. I've tried it for splitting wood, and while you can do it, the blade often gets stuck 1/2 way down your log. This is simply because of the blade width. An axe is brilliant because it gets wider so fast, causing your wood to split.   Lightweight backcountry travel. I love this Woodsman's Pal to death, but I never take it with me when I'm hiking or backpacking. It's just too heavy. I have taken it canoeing, however, when weight is less of an issue. It's always great to have around the campfire.  Overall, I've enjoyed my years with this Pal and plan to use it steadily for many years to come. Like any good tool, this one is certainly made to last a lifetime.  .............  This product was not given to me as part of any promotion. This review is entirely the result of my own opinions and use of the product.	1
A wonderfully handy tool; even the wife likes and uses it.	1
Very nice. Plus its made in the USA.	1
This thing can be used from machete work to camp axe work .  It comes with a blade grind of about 35 degrees which is running toward a camp axe grind .The blade is stiff too and doen't flex while cutting . I used mine the first time on a 2 1/2 inch dead Red Elm limb which was rock hard . It took 5 chops to cut it but it would have taken as many with a camp axe .  The nice part was no hand shock (love that part), very balanced heavier blade making easier work and it was as sharp when finished as when it started .  That surprised me since that limb was HARD and I hit it hard. Most green limbs 1 1/2 and under you cut with one good swing .  Hook works very well on vines, small green sprouts, and briars too . It simply doesn't work me to death like most small camp axes and machetes I've used since it has good, balanced weight and again holds an edge. It is easy to carry and if I had to have just one tool for cutting heavier camp axe type work with some leafy type cutting I would go with this . Made in the U.S.A. and better metal than most tools of this type . It may seem to be expensive but when I count the cost of cheaper Camp Axes, and machetes I've  bought over the years and not been happy with it suddenly is pretty cheap .	1
To be honest, I didn't really expect this to help my mosquito problem, but I was desperate to reclaim the use of my yard and I figured it was worth a shot. There's a fairly big pond nearby and it throws up a monstrous storm of mosquitos in the summer.  This year, it was so bad that my wife could hardly venture outside.  I ran the Mega-Catch most of the Summer and it's been a terrific performer. The first day, the collection cup was full.  After a week, it was rare to see a mosquito, even at sundown.  I put the unit about 20' away from the house and I used flat root beer as the sweetener for the collection cup.  For the first month, I used the Octenol attactant, but for the next two months, I omitted it and the unit still seemed to work just fine. The unit has a timer that automatically cuts it on and off, but I just let it run around the clock -- no noticable effect on the power bill.	1
very well made. wish i had one of these in vietnam instead of a machete!	1
excellent quality, well made handy clearing brush, small trees. Handle/guard is important, I may add a tether.	1
Machete/hatchet in one. More for clearing thick shrubs, bushes and small trees than tall grass, vines, etc. This thing is built real well and tough. Full tang and leather wrapped handle feels so solid. Made in USA!	1
This is a wonderful tool for landscaping clean-up work. The tool weight is perfect - heavy enough so I can get my back into a good swing when chopping branches; light enough so that I can use it for an extended time without tiring or strain. I love the leather-wrapped grip - makes it SO easy to maintain a secure grip even when my hands are wet. I've used it for clearing branches, clearing out dead shrubs, thinning bamboo canes, and several other tasks. An absolute joy to use provided the blade is kept sharp.  The fact that this is US made using all US parts is icing on the cake. This is a tool that, with proper care, will easily outlive the owner.  I debated getting this model versus the standard, and opted for this mainly because of the hand guard. While that has been nice, the leather grip alone is worth the extra cost of the premium model versus the regular one.  I also opted to save a few bucks and get the nylon sheath rather than the leather one. While I'm sure the leather sheath looks and works great, the nylon one performs just fine. The material is thick and sturdy; there's an interior pouch that holds the sharpening stone; and there's velcro on the side (plus a sturdy metal snap closure on the top) to make it easy to insert/remove the blade. It also has a belt loop if you want to keep the tool at your side at all times.  Speaking of which, if you do use this for zombie attacks, be sure to strike with the hook portion on the side of the head, not the top. A top down strike will get the job done, but there's a strong risk of the blade getting stuck. A side strike makes it much easier to dislodge the blade should you be dealing with a herd. If you're looking for pointers on the Walking Dead, emulate Daryl's methods, not Glenn's.	1
This machete is the one I have been seeking for what seems like forever. I live in Florida on several acres, and am constantly being overrun by pesky vines and palmettos. It seemed the only people out there making machetes were Asians using softer metals and thin blades. The Woodsman's Pal has solid mass to it, a steel that is stronger which keeps an edge and a functional hand-guard. The leather handle is a good and needed for those hot days for a good grip. They make several tiers of options, for me the one with the leather handle and guard is a minimum. Those options are not aesthetic but very functional.  Pros:  Design  Weight  Quality steel  Leather Handle  Hand-guard  American made  Cons:  Pricey	1
As others have stated, the metal on this is pretty thin, and the welds on the cover hinges are very flimsy, it's clearly not that well made and I don't know how long it will last, but I am very happy with it for the time being.  Honestly, it's probably only worth 30 bucks from a discount store, but sadly firepits are very popular right now and unless you spend twice the money you're going to find all of them in this price range are pretty flimsy.  The size of this one however is fantastic and when I've got it going it's pretty close to havinga full size indoor fireplace in my backyard...  Pros:   Big   Fully covered with hinged front screen, cover is removable   Reasonbly priced   Sturdy enough for casual use.  Cons:   Construction is a bit flimsy / poorly made - may not last many years...?   Cooking grate is nice, but only covers 1/3 of firepit   Not very weatherproof  Overall - if you want a big firepit but don't want to spend too much, this one should fit the bill pretty well.	1
This works good as long as you leave it in one place. If you are going to move it around a lot I would get something more sturdy. When you pick this up the outer rail flexes. And if you leave it outside the screen rusts even though it's covered up. Other than that you can make a good sized fire in this.	1
Easy to put together. Top part doesn't attach to fire pit, which is a great touch.	1
Nice fire pit.  Portable, easy to carry.  Only issue is there's no way for air to get to the bottom of the fire. I drilled a half dozen 1/2" holes in the bottom, it seems to help a lot.  Cooker grill works well, but wish it came with two of them.  Cover grate works well, and is easy to operate and fit over the fire.	1
Easy to assmbly as long as you follow the pictures in the assembly instructions	1
It was easy to put together, and seems like it is sturdy enough with a cross tip, and an adjustable wrench.  Let me burn a couple of loads of work through it and I'll review it again.  Warning. MIC.	1
This was flimsier than I expected, but worked ok. The spark grating could be better designed. It wasn't linear and had gaps near seams. It also had visible dents, but they were easily repaired.	1
I DID NOT BUY THIS Northwoods FIRE PIT and GRILL FROM "Wayfair"!!! None the less, I own it for only a few weeks. After just 4 or 5 fires, the fire pit screen looks like this... 'nough said.	-1
This is a great fireplace. I wish it had thicker bottom, but I am still happy with my purchase.	1
This is a great bench and picnic table. It is sturdy, I thought the food would tip over but it don't. We used it as a bench and when we need it as a picnic table we just flip it over. I can't say enough about it. We really love them.	1
We've had this for a few months and so far so good. For the money it's a great buy. At first we did put sand in the bottom as the instructions say but later dumped it and used a regular fireplace log holder. We've even used it to cook burgers and chicken (with charcoal briquettes not wood).  The hinged door is a little flimsy and the hinge doesn't let it sit flush with the top but it doesn't impact how it functions. We also like how it's easy to move around on our stoned patio. Considering the cost, it's a great buy. Assembly was easy too.  I posted a photo of it in use.	1
I have been searching for the perfect bench for my front porch for a while now...I kept coming back to this because I love the idea of being able to have a table when I need one.  It only took me about 20 minutes to put the whole set together, and I am completely happy with the quality & comfort of the benches.  I have already recommended this to a few friends.	1
We love these benches.  They are comfortable and easily maintained.  They convert to a table when needed and serve dual purpose.  We get many compliment.  Well worth the investment.	1
A little thinner plastic than I was expecting but works like it says.	1
I am loving this bench for my garden!  Just a note - you must purchase 2 of these to push together to make a picnic table.  I only wanted one because I don't have a flat area to use as a picnic table.  It's much bigger than I expected, and the directions inside include info on the cushion you can get for it (I'm probably going to go for cheap and look at Ollie's).  It's a clever design (seat & table in one) and it's well made.  The install was okay - I was unable to put this together by myself - the holes wouldn't line up and I'm not tool savvy but in general it's an easy installation for someone strong and familiar with a few tools.  A couple notes - when it's being used as a bench, and you have young children, you must mention not to lean or sit on the table portion as it will tip.  Also, when you are putting it together, don't sit on it until the 2 bottom brace panels are on.  The panels will really bend if you don't install them first.  If you have pets and you do it indoors, beware this resin attracts every piece of fur and dust!  I took mine outside where it will be staying and let the rain remove it.  Overall, this is a great bench and I'm really happy with it.	1
I love these.  I did have to have help putting it together because of the length.  It only took about 20 minutes or half hour to put both together with help.  They are sturdy and easy to clean.  I will be getting lots of use out of these this summer.	1
Easy to assemble and very sturdy. Just bought one to put outside at the end of the driveway where the front of the house meets.	1
My husband put each bench together in less than 15 minutes. This is the perfect seating solution for our Gulf boat dock. Made of heavy duty shiny white resin, it will withstand the sun + salt air much better than anything else we would have put out there. As benches, they'll work great for fishing along the edge of the dock, and converted, they're perfect for grabbing a bite to eat. Each bench is sturdy and will clean-up easily with a spray of the hose. This bench is EXACTLY what what we needed and wanted, for a great price.	1
I bought two, so that I would have a whole bench, but find I use it more often as two separate benches than as a table. I live in FL & this bench sits in the sun, but seems to be holding up well. When used as a table, the seat & each half of the table is 15 inches wide & about 5 feet long. We use the benches next to our corn-hole toss game, to provide seating for onlookers.  It flips super easy & is especially great when we are having a pool party & need a place for wet kids to eat. I've also used half a table for working on arts & crafts with my granddaughter. I really like it/them!	1
Received so quickly, I was surprised.  I put both benches together myself, so this isn't very difficult to do. I am not that strong, so my husband left me his impact to use -VERY CAREFULLY -- you don't need to tighten that much. (We did purchased two so we could have the picnic table, although I truly like just flipping over the back rest and eating that way ----although I don't know what the weight of the plates etc will do as far as the "table" part bowing. )  So looking forward to summer and getting to use them.  Hoping they hold up well.	1
My dogs and I love to sit on these benches and it is easy to flip the back to make a sturdy table.  Glad I bought two of them for my porch.	1
Surprisingly excellent quality. VERY EASY TO ASSEMBLE!	1
This bench is amazing!  It's even comfortable!  I love that it converts so easily from a bench to a table.  I use it in the garden and it makes a lot of tasks so much easier for me.  Thank you!	1
Great product. Easy assembly. Great customer service	1
Not much to say beyond this is about the fifth one I've bought. People steal them from pubs, TSA confiscated one from my son saying it could be used as a weapon. (It was raining hard; that guy just wanted a boss umbrella). I've used them in super-windy conditions. They never blow inside out. Love the red color, but I also have the black larger one.	1
As promised	1
Great seating solution and I purchased a second to make a picnic table love it and easy to assemble	1
Fantastic in every way! Easily assembled,and will order another one next year!	1
It's perfect and SO EASY to put together.  If I can do this all by myself ANYBODY can.  I put it together in my kitchen in no time (it keeps raining and raining here on the East Coast and finally I decided it was getting put together no matter what....lol) and had two teens take outside on the porch.  I wish I had this years ago.  It's durable and will easy to keep clean and looking like new. It won't rot or need painting/staining.  It doesn't get better than this!	1
This is one beautifully made umbrella.  It has weight without being heavy.  It kept me completely dry in a downpour.  If anyone is in need of a good umbrella, this is the one to get.	1
Nice chair, very sturdy and easy to put together	1
Such a clever piece of furniture. The benches are very light weight and easy to move, but still feel very sturdy when in use. A must for any lake house.	1
After a bit of a problem with my order and delivery I am happy with the purchase. It was very easy to put together.  It stayed outside all winter and it stood up really well to the harsh weather and heavy snow we had this past year. I like that it can convert from bench to table.  I actually bought 2 so I could put them together as a picnic table.	1
Very sturdy and easy to clean. We use them as benches on our covered porch and put them together as a picnic table when needed. Very handy and we highly recommend.	1
very good!	1
Stands up in high winds as I walk/commute through the city, definitely recommend!	1
Didn't hold up to its reputation, broke in a few months.  Now trying to get the lifetime garuntee....this should be fun.	-1
Made in America.  Easy to Assemble.  Comfortable.  Sturdy.  I highly recommend it.  What more can I say.  Buy just one for an added bench and occasional eating area, or buy two for two benches and a complete picnic table.  Amazing product.  Thank you.	1
I only ordered one to see if I would like it. I love it. I will prob order another one. It was easy to put together and very comfy. I would def recommend it.	1
Someone recommended this for use as an autopsy table. I don't see how this is possible but as a bench it is terrific and the kids love it. Conversion is easy (if you study your catechism) and a good time is had by all.	1
GREAT! It's very wind resistant and very strong. I am totally pleased. Today, 1/23/2017 was a very windy day in NYC and this umbrella held up very well the whole day!!	1
Christmas gift	1
Nice small umbrella. Compact when closed. But I've just bought the 48", and I prefer the size and handle. Check it out before you buy this 43" one.	1
I absolutely love this umbrella! It is well made and sturdy. I use it a lot in the summer for shade, and it handles wind with no problem. I recently got to try it in the rain, and it performed well there too.	1
Seemed extremely durable.  Delivered Saturday, gave it to my wife on Sunday morning because it was raining she left it on a bench at the train station Sunday evening.  Ya Marriage!!!!!	1
Still using this.	1
arrived new and as described	1
Works well.	1
I've been running these for over a dozen years, but keep leaving them all over the world. :-(	1
Great umbrella. Love the color. So vibrant. Nice to have one that stands out. Great protection in the rain. Have only used it a few times but met my expectations . I am very please with the fact that it has two Velcro straps to hold it together	1
This is a great umbrella, even If you don't need the wind resistance of it.  Good size, and excellent durability but isn't overly heavy or bulky (it is a bit heavier than traditional light-duty umbrellas).  Not cheap, but also not frustrating, will definitely last a long time, does well in wind (I've had it out in 20mph winds and rain), and comes with a good carrying case/cover.	1
I think these are about the best umbrellas you can get. I also have a larger, golf-sized model of the same brand. For some reason Fayetteville St in downtown Raleigh is a wind tunnel. One street over you can be perfectly comfortable, but for some reason Fayetteville St is a cold hair dryer. But it's perfect to test this umbrella and I can vouch for its effectiveness. With a 30 mph wind you wind up having to hold it with 2 hands, but it doesn't flip inside out and keeps you nice and dry. Highly recommended.	1
Very nice!	1
Perfect size for our son who walks to work in downtown Chicago.  Vents for windy days too.	1
I bought one for my spouse more than 6 years ago and it's still working great.  We have other umbrellas where the pop up mechanism has failed, the fabric has failed and the structure has failed in a far shorter period.  Very happy with this umbrella!	1
I love GusBuster umbrellas. Unfortunately I bought the small instead of the large. Meant to exchange but managed to lose the umbrella bag. We spoke to the inventor years ago after he was interviewed on CNN. He was so personable and enthusiastic about his product, it was impossible not to buy from him. We bought (and lost) several umbrellas over the years. So we will keep this one just in case.	1
good product. works great	1
This is the second one I have obtained. I still own the first one and it is about 5 years old. The only thing that happened to the first one is that I lost the cap for the top of the umbrella. The new one looks great and the design is still superior to regular umbrellas. I like that the bag has a long enough strap that you can secure it across your back. Most umbrellas get lost because we don't carry them with us all the time and tend to forget them. If you don't want to make a stranger happy, keep this one on your back when the showers stop.	1
Very good umbrella for the money.  Strong wind resistance and compact.	1
wife likes it	1
Bought one for my wife.  She loves it.  Has worked well for quite a while.	1
Great umbrella. I've had it for two years and am buying a 2nd one. I just handed my old one to my son at the airport when he discovered he forgot to pack one. I can't live without it. Holds up great on the windy streets of NYC. During most rain storms every garbage can on the street contains a broken cheap umbrella.	1
great umbrella. I was tired of buying cheap umbrellas that get turned inside out in the wind. I made the small investment and was totally worth it. I have had it for over a year now and I always keep it in my bag. No issues on my commutes in the Windy City	1
Great Product.  Easy to assemble.  UPS delivered the box in damaged condition, but the Fire Pit was packed very good by manufacturer and no damage to product.	1
We bought this to keep in the car, fits nicely under the seat and has a nice carry case.	1
works beautifully and i am excited to use it this winter.	1
This is one of the few units you will see with wheels. Allows me to easily move it on the back porch when not in use. Very reasonable price.	1
UPDATE: Living in southern California we don't get much rain so it wasn't used much since my below review. However, it was about 9 months old and it is already dysfunctional. The umbrella won't lock and one of the metal ribs already tore away from the material. Not much of a "Gustbuster" with the very little use it has received. I should have written this actually when it first started having problems which was at the end of our rainy season last spring.  We needed this several times for a trip we took that included rain. It was so windy we saw people in front of us with inside out umbrella's or broken umbrella's laying on the side of the sidewalks. Ours held up 100% and kept us dry. My only negative is that the information on the web page made it sound like it had a large circumference. it doesn't. it will keep you dry but it's not really large enough for two people to walk comfortably under. Still, it's worth 5 stars for the $$.	-1
GREAT fire pit !  This is my second one --- first one lasted about 5-6 years, and that is with storing outside even during the cold northern Ohio winters.  Unlike most other fire pits, this one stands tall --- so, the fire is actually up higher (as opposed to sitting on the ground level), and better to look at and warm you !!!  360 views of the entire fire, and it can take a LOT of logs at once, no need to keep adding logs constantly.  I also bought the Weber cover (Weber 7460 premium fireplace cover) thru Amazon, and that cover fits just fine.	1
Found this to be easy to put together.  Its not quite as heavy as I expected.  With the wheels and handle, it is easy to move.  There is plenty of room to stack the wood for a decent size fire and sitting around it in the evening is quite nice.  There are a couple of things that keep me from giving this a 5 star review.  The first is that the lid just sits on top and a 20 mph wind will have the lid flying.  We found it necessary to use a bungee cord on it when not in use to keep the lid in place.  The second is that there isn't a door to let you add or move the wood around once a fire is going.  You have to remove the lid, and pretty much drop the wood in it.  Coming in from the side would be safer and more convenient.  But the screens do remove for clearing out the debris.	1
A little fiddly to put together, loads of screws, but works great.	1
Very Bad product, did not last a month. When returned Gustbuster said they cannot replace in less than 2 months as product comes from China, and no one working in China due to Chinese new year - Very arrogant customer service not ready to listen and resolve customer's complaints. Once you buy, you are stuck with almost no warranty - i wasted more money in shipping back than cost of the product with no replacement in a month.	-1
Appeared much sturdier in a picture than it really is!  Yet does serve my purposes and was not that expensive in the long run.  It may not hold up too well over this Chicago Winter, unless I get it inside the garage soon. I will get my money's worth before we get snowed in for the Winter.	1
Worth the price.  They don't break and stand up to strong winds.	1
We love this fire pit.  We've used it almost everyday this summer..	1
Great outdoor  portable fireplace. I also use it to burn large amounts of branches, twings etc. makes for and easy and fun way for yard clean up without the expense of having someone dispose of the yard debris.	1
We are very unhappy with this product.  I bought it because of the good reviews.  Perhaps we got a lemon but the wheels do not work.  I bought it so that we could move it on and off the patio as needed.  We only used it once as it seemed too dangerous to use such a wobbly firepit.  We are going to have to throw it away.  Actually, we will donate it to someone who collects scrap metal.	-1
We like it.  But we didn't get the red one.  A black one was substituted. All's good.  The males in the house preferred black anyway.	1
good quality,great deal for the money allows for a nice size fire safely	1
I bought this reluctantly, I wanted another Weber outdoor fireplace, but they discontinued making them. This seems a nice replacement, it sits a little taller, seems pretty comparable.  The wheels make it easier to move, they are splayed out a bit, the only part of the fireplace that seems at all substandard.  Easy to assemble.  I put the recommended sand in the base, haven't clean the ashes out yet.  The Weber, I simply tilted and rinsed with the hose. I'll have to scoop out the ashes with this one.  I used it only once so far, had a rip roaring fire, hope it is a durable as the Weber. I can recommend it. The smores were great too.	1
I got this for Christmas and I love it!!! nice size great for the money, and they shipped it for free!!!! much better then going to store and trying to get home your self. thanks for a great gift mom!!!	1
I am an avid bonfire burner.  I had one of these for 8 years and it finally just had enough of the elements.  I have been searching and searching for a new firepit over the last 2 years.  I have ended up buying 3 others on Amazon, shipping them here and then returning them for various reasons you can see in my reviews.  Besides, I really burn my bonfires hot so the smoke rises fast and is less of a burden in the neighborhood.  My last model of this pit actually had hinged doors on one of the sides and those were really convenient for loading in wood from the side.  However, I have to say, there are some advantages to having this new model.  This model has a lid with a sturdy steel hanging clip on the inside of it so you can attach the lid to the side of the firepit, which for me, lets me load wood from the top and keep the smoke rising fast, rather than billow out from the sides from hitting the lid.  This one does not have holes in the lid but the holes never really did too much for ventilation anyway.   I have wanted to buy a really thick steel firepit but the money is considerable as an investment so I had been keeping my eye on this one as my ultimate choice for new replacement - while my wife wanted something more decorative, this one is a really sturdy firepit for this amount of money.  And until we are ready to spend $500+ on a 1/4 inch steel bowl, this was the way to go again and I am very happy.  One thing I am doing different this time is buying the cover that pairs up with this on Amazon, its green, and very strong material.  I returned it originally because we wanted to find one that matches our outdoor furniture covers but couldn't so I re-purchased the green one.	1
Like the size, mobility and construction. For the price you can't beat it. A suggestion for those of you who may like to cook over a wood fire. This firepit comes with a nice round grill that fits inside the bottom of the base for a charcoal type grilling. Well, the high spark screen that fits inside the grill and has the black cover on it, is attached screen to screen by very short screws and nuts. I went to hardware store and purchased  three replacement screws and nuts at about 1 1/2 inches and attached the top part of the screen with them. This extension allows the grill to be placed securely on top of the screen. WA - LA ,now you are ready to cook over the wood fire. Besides cooking, it is perfect for sitting around on a chilly night and having a cigar or a cup of coffee. The Weber cover, purchased separately fits fine and is less expensive than...	1
Got this for my son, as his last one had finally burnt out after almost ten years.  Great quality, good price, no negatives.	1
Very nice	1
Pros: (Reason for +4 star) -Sits high, so warmth is felt sitting next to it.  I find low pits warm the feet well, but not the rest of the body.  This style allows you to warm your feet under the pit, and the lid directs the heat nicely from the sides, which efficiently limits loss of heat from the top. -Sturdy.  Once put together the pieces fit well and feel snug.  I have owned other pits where the lid or the spark screen never felt like they sat right.  Con: (Reason for -1 star) -I have owned for about 3mo and had 8-10 fires.  The paint or the silver finish on the spark screen has started to flake in some small places.  Tips: -Follow the instructions regarding sand on the bottom of the saucer, it will equate to a longer life for your new pit. -Get a Cover if left outside.  No pit is immune to rust if they have to endure the elements 24/7.  Canvas works great to protect.	1
I travel into NYC and the wind can be a challenge. This umbrella can handle the wind. Burgundy is a dark burgundy. Easy to open and shut. Has double straps to close and is not too large but large enough. I am very pleased.	1
Ive had this gust buster for 2 years now and for the most part its done well. Minor leakage when the rain really comes down but it fits nicely in my workbag and helps get to where I need to go	1
Great Buy!	1
This is a replacement for another Gustbuster that, after many, many uses, has given up the ghost.  These are the best umbrellas for the money!	1
It works well, very strong. Overkill for most but you will lose it before breaking it.	1
Works as advertised. It's a little heavy but I suppose it has to be to withstand wind that destroys most umbrellas.	1
With stands the winds.  No other umbrella I have used would hold up!  They always ended up being turned inside out and useless!!!	1
I was fed up with my old one day umbrellas and this one seems to be doing just fine. It lived through Boston fall/winter without being ripped apart. Like this so far	1
The umbrella looks and feels strong. I am glad that it came with a black instead of silver handle, as shown in picture. I just threw away my older similar one which bent on one side for some reason. The round circles are kind of a nice touch to the look. It is harder to fold up than my last one and it also has two straps. I was able to finally close it and put it back into black nylon case with rope to put over your shoulder. I like straps so I don't have to carry in hand all the time. FOLLOWUP: AFTER USING THE UMBRELLA A FEW TIMES, A HEAVY RAIN AND WIND HIT IT ONE DAY AND IT WENT DOWN FROM THERE. IT WOULD NOT CLOSE UP CORRECTLY. AMAZON WAS NICE ENOUGH TO LET ME RETURN FOR CREDIT. I BOUGHT A NICE MASCULINE MEN'S FOLD UP ONE W/WOOD TYPE HANDLE FROM MACY'S CALLED "SHEDRAIN". WHEN I ARRIVED HOME, I NOTICED A BONUS BECAUSE IT SAID ON THE PUSH BUTTON: "OPEN & CLOSE". I HAVE NOT HAD ONE OF THESE IN YEARS!  IT WAS $40 AND I GOT IT ON SALE FOR $32.00.	1
I live in Chicago and most of the time it rains there is a good bit of wind. On any rainy day the garbage cans in downtown Chicago are filled with broken umbrellas, mine included. This works well as it does not turn inside out with a strong gust of wind. However, it is a bit larger than I would like. It does not fit in my work bag, a bit too long. So, I ended up buying a different unbrella.	1
I own two other GustBuster umbrellas, both golf sized. They are amazing for their durability and for operating without turning inside-out even on windy days. This is a smaller version of those, but just as sturdy. It is lightweight and reliable.	1
Resists Chicago winds, rain, and mixture of rain and snow.  Great umbrella that is strong and worth the money.  Other flimsy umbrellas don't stand a chance and you see them in the garbage.	1
My wife uses this umbrella whenever it rains. She loves the fact that it is wind proof and does not blow away when gust of wind hit. Shes has small hands but can hold the umbrella and open it with no problem. She has had it for a few years now and it has not failed her. She loves that it came in pink and that it has a carry case (great for storing also.). The stitching and design is great and has not come undone. I would definitely buy again. Amazon had the best price around.	1
I've had two of these, and they both seem to have trouble with some of the bits staying attached.  Stuff falls off (like the string on the handle, the screw-in button on top, etcetera).  That said, the darned thing actually works great as an umbrella even in the very worst storm and gustiest wind.  So, not perfect, but perfectly functional, and better than any other umbrella I've ever used in a wind storm.	1
Exactly what I was looking for, sturdy and easy to handle. The fabric is nice and it's well constructed. So far the wind hasn't been any problem.	1
This is the second Gustbuster I purchased. They are great and should be for the price. This was a little smaller then I imagined and I know the dimensions are given but I did not stop to visualize the size. I am still keeping it and will come in handy to carry along when the larger one is not practical.	1
The GustBuster Metro 43-Inch Automatic Umbrella (Black) is perfect.  At 6'2" i need an umbrella that will truly keep me dry and not fall apart in all this wind.	1
My only complaint is that it is small.  It said it would be able to cover 2 people.  I wish it were a little bit larger.  Hard to tell how big things are online in a picture.  Other than that this is a great product.	1
We purchased a pair of these umbrellas for the occasional need during rainy days in Los Angeles. Both umbrellas are now damaged with limited use. Very poor construction. The lifetime warranty is a joke. Why? You need to pay nearly $10 for "shipping and handling". I can understand a modest fee for shipping, but "handling". Gees. I will never purchase a product from this manufacturer again.	-1
For those who hate it when the wind blows your umbrella around, you'll enjoy the fact that the wind just doesn't have any effect on this one.  Pretty quality construction, attractive, reasonable price, and it keeps you dry!!!  What more do you want from an umbrella?	1
We own three of these umbrellas.  They are compact and easly to hold, open and close.  Their design is perfect for windy and rainy days.  I have never had one lose its shape due to a wind gust.	1
On college campus along the shore of one of the Great Lakes in my youth, I once watched a gust of wind simultaneously flip more than 100 umbrellas inside out as students were crossing campus to get to their classes.  So I've had my reservations about wasting money on umbrellas when a rain coat would do just as well.  The GustBuster umbrella is different: cleverly vented, the wind gusts pass right through it ... while you stay dry beneath.  I've used it on some very blowy days, when the gusts and rains were erratic and almost coming sideways!  I stayed dry.  This umbrella will be the one I carry in my car for many years to come.  (Now I think we need one for the truck...)	1
I've had other umbrellas turn inside out during heavy winds.  This one does exactly what it promises to do.  I bought several for my relatives and they continue to thank me.  It's the best, and I certainly recommend it.	1
I love this umbrella!!  It is long lasting and of great quality!  I would buy another one if I didn't already have	1
Very good, sturdy umbrella, but it doesn't fold up all that small. Will fit in my briefcase, but I got tired of carrying it around with me due to its size.	1
I've owned this particular umbrella for.... 6 years now?  It has held up well over time.  It has gradually worn down as time has progressed: One of the ribs came apart - but I fixed that with a paperclip.  All of the bits of string attaching the tarp to the ribs have come undone or broken apart - but they aren't necessary.  Tiny holes have appeared in the fabric, but that hasn't stopped it working for me.  The final straw was that one of the ribs came apart from the central hub of the umbrella itself.  I can't fix that. Now, I know this had a warranty that came with it when I bought it.  I had saved that piece of paper for years, and of course I can't find it when I need it.  But I looked online, and the company said to call and get an RMA # (Return Merchandise Authorization) and mail it back with a $10 check made out to Gustbuster.  So, you have to pay $5 to ship it back, and $10 for them to ship you a new one, but that's fine by me - if they do that.  This review is 5 stars - for now - and assuming they hold up their end of the deal and send me a new one, I'll keep this review as-is, and update you all with the status of my repair/replacement order! Thanks for reading! **** UPDATE: It's been weeks now, and I haven't heard back! I haven't received a replacement or repaired umbrella like they promised!!! I'm downgrading the stars to 3. If they get back to me, then I'll consider moving it up to 4 stars. **** UPDATE 2.0: Got it!  Got a NEW umbrella in the mail yesterday!!!  So, they replaced my old one.  The new one is nice - the handle is SILVER now instead of my old black.  Also - I think the overall size of the umbrella is smaller than my old one - not by a lot but it definitely seems smaller....  hmmmm....  But anyway - they did as they promised and replaced my old busted umbrella.  Pretty cool.  Let's see how this one stands up to the test of time!!!	1
The Gustbuster Metro umbrella is advertised as a 43" umbrella. Warning, it only measures 36" at it's widest point. It measures even less if you measure it from flat to flat end. This is not a minor difference but it's an entire 7" short of what is advertised on the Gustbuster website. This is a VERY SMALL umbrella maybe OK for children but why would a child need an umbrella tested at 55mph. If possible, I would rate this a MINUS -5 Stars as the company does not know how to sell  their items honestly	-1
Mine broke after two years of intermittent use.  A pin dropped out of one of the joints.  I think a $30+ umbrella needs to do better than that.  Gustbuster wants $10 "shipping and handling" to repair it.  Is it worth it?  How long until another pin drops out?  I am disappointed with the quality.  It might be better to buy three $10 umbrellas rather than one $30 umbrella, because the expensive one will not last much longer than the cheaper ones...	-1
I received and used my red gustbuster metro yesterday on my mile walk to the bus stop. The roads I walk on are like little wind tunnels between buildings and I've never been able to use any small tote umbrella because they would all break and invert. The only umbrella that would withstand the wind gusts are the large vented golf umbrellas and those are hard to carry around with a full packpack and other things.  I was surprised at how strong the umbrella was. In fact, it put my arms in check because there were a few times felt like I was about to blow away. I really had to hold on tight. The handle is a small plastic piece that does feel cheap and would probably break off. But, it held up pretty well. I read the reviews on here about the poor quality of the umbrella and I checked mine out upon receipt and it seemed to be made very well and very sturdy. The ribs of the umbrella beneath the canopy look very well made and reinforced unlike the cheaper models I've had in the past.  Therefore, this umbrella does weigh a little more than the cheaper ones.  The only part that felt a little flimsy was the stem of the umbrella where the 2 pieces are connected. I was worried that the top half of the umbrella would snap off and I'd be left holding the handle with a silver metal stem as my canopy blew away. To my surprise, walking into the wind on my way to the bus stop this sucker held its ground. In Hawaii we have nice tradewinds and lots of sun, so having this umbrella makes my walks bearable in the hawaiian sunshine.  As far as opening and closing, I don't like to pop the umbrella with one hand. I've had so many umbrellas break on me because of this so I like to guide it open slowly. When closing, this umbrella does not close completely on its own. I click it down once, manually squeeze the umbrella completely closed and then click it down a second time. Before manually closing it down, check the velcro straps. Because of the pleats, the strap closest to the handle can sometimes get lost. So check to make sure it's out so you can secure both straps before putting away.  I expect to use this umbrella daily and if anything changes or does break/fall apart, I'll definitely update my review. I did email my information to gustbuster for warranty purposes.  Overall, of all the tote style umbrellas I've had in the past, this is the best one thus far. I'm happy with it.  Update 8/15/11 We were having some gusty winds last week and for the first time, my umbrella inverted. It was a fairly strong gust and I knew it would invert eventually because this is a smaller umbrella. The larger golf sized umbrellas  hold up better but are bulky to carry around. It flipped twice. The one thing I was impressed with was that it took a quick touch on the umbrella for it to pop right back into place. So, although I was shocked that this gustbuster didn't hold up to 55 mph gusts like it says, it holds up fairly well considering how small this umbrella is. So, I still use it with confidence.  Update 6/4/14 I am still using this umbrella with my daily commute and the ONLY things that have broken off are the velcro pads on the straps to secure the umbrella when not in use. I tried to stitch on new sets and my sewing machine had a hard time going through the velcro with adhesive. So, one of the straps is unusable and the other strap is holding on for dear life. Well, not the strap but the velcro patch.  The open/close, the handles, the ribs, everything else is fully intact and completely functional with absolutely no problems at all.  UPDATE 11/17/15 This umbrella is still kicking! Nothing broken. Still holding tough. I'm so glad I invested in this umbrella. While others have gone through a dozen of them by now, mine is still going!	1
It succeeds at its major selling point -- it seems to withstand fairly strong wind without inverting itself -- nice.  Mine slowly disintegrated over the course of a couple of years -- and it wasn't used heavily, mostly it just sat in the back of my car and was used on average a couple of times a month.  First the wrist strap separated from the handle -- and because of the way that it's made, it's not simple to just pop it back in.  Next the tips kept separating from the ribs, getting worse over time -- it was impossible to open it without having at least part of the canopy flapping around loosely.  Finally, the retainer on top that keeps the spring-loaded carrier in place fell off one day and the umbrella became unusable at that point.  The materials seem top quality, but poor construction led to an early demise.  My experience with this item makes it likely that I would never buy another GustBuster product.	-1
This is a powerful umbrella. So powerful, that it's slightly difficult to close (it's a manual close unit). It has performed exceedingly well in heavy rainfall with excessive winds (up to 30MPH). However, I only had the opportunity to use it approximately 6 times over a 1 year period, and then it failed to close after opening. The stalk (?) became dislodged from the canopy, and the spring shot out. I was unable to repair it myself, and the company wanted me to pay to ship it there, and send them a check for $10 to return it. So, I'll just order a different umbrella - probably a ShedRain WindPro or Leighton Windefeyer. I see that Amazon only carries the Gustbuster in Pink now, so maybe they've stopped selling these anyway.	-1
I must admit that I was somewhat hesitant to replace my Totes "Bigtop" collapsible with a Gustbuster, considering the difference in price.  But I figured the extra money would be well spent on a more durable product.  The Totes did give me excellent performance, but it was starting to get long in the tooth and the metal stays were not compressing down like they used to.  During heavy rain, the Totes also did have a tendency to let small splatters of rain through.  So I figured the Gustbuster would be better all around, and I paid my money.  When the umbrella arrived, I was impressed with the construction and extra bracing, and it appeared the umbrella would live up to its expectations.  However on its first use, it permanently broke.  And the circustances are thus:  I had just finished walked the dog and had entered the inside of my home.  I was suspending the umbrella by the cord in the handle two feet off my vinyl covered floor.  The cord slipped off my finger and the umbrella dropped to the floor.  It was then I noticed the top cap had popped off.  An easy fix, I thought, until I picked up the umbrella and inspected.  The piece that came off was not a cap at all, but the top of a piece of solid plastic that held the very top of the nylon material to the center shaft.  This was not a small piece of plastic, but about 1/3 of an inch thick - certainly enough to survive what should be an every day occurrence for an umbrella.  I gave the Gustbuster two stars because the design is good, but must grade it down heavily for poor materials.  Not worth the money, and I would not recommend this umbrella to a friend.  Very surprised and disappointed.	-1
This sounded like a great product; however, it did not live up to expectations.  Upon using this product for the first time, the auto up-down button did not function.  When attempting to open the umbrella, it only opened about half way up, forcing me to have to push it up the rest of the way.  While it was open, it did seem extremely sturdy.  When attempting to close the umbrella via the button, it did not even partially close, again forcing me to have to do it manually.  I have received a return authorization from Amazon for this item.	-1
The umbrella is relatively well designed but it did not last as long as the study design might make you think initially. The plastic bits where the spikes join with the periphery of the canopy are poorly made and easily get torn from the canopy. Because the spikes are not attached to them permanently, once the bit breaks off from the canopy, you lose it in the dirth and you cannot repare the umbrella. I was much happier with my London Fog before I got this one.	-1
If you travel to windy places where it rains, this is the umbrella for you.  The cheap "travel" umbrellas are just that.  The extra money you will pay for this superior product is worth its weight in effectiveness. Don't pack something that just won't work in a breeze.	1
This is in my bag every day, carry it to the gym/pool when I think it might rain.  As such, I wish it were a little smaller & lighter.  However, that's the price you pay for it not self-destructing in a stiff breeze - I have had a series of mutilated ones, Totes and off-brands.  I took the strap off the wrapper, which I still use to protect the umbrella in my bag.  The Metro is definitely a compromise.  I also got the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/GustBuster-Proseries-Gold-62-Inch-Golf-Umbrella/dp/B000AMSCPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">GustBuster Proseries Gold 62-Inch Golf Umbrella</a>, for when it's already raining.  It's the real deal.  UPDATE 7-12-2009 (original 11-25-2007) This umbrella is constructed with fiberglass tines.  Plastic caps sewn to the fabric fit over the tines, to hold the fabric on.  On this model, those caps are connected to elastic straps.  This system worked fine for quite a while.  However, last Spring, every time I opened it up, one or more of the caps had fallen off.  Putting them back on was a nuisance - essentially, it had to be repaired before every use - in the rain.  The warranty: call them up and get an RMA, send them the umbrella with $10, and they will repair or replace it.  That was more trouble and cost than it was worth to me, so I superglued the caps to the tines.  So far, so good.	1
This is a good product. Well made, no noticeable defects. Be sure to check gauge size before ordering. This is thinner wire.	1
perfect	1
worked great & the price was right.	1
Worked to build rabbit hutch, could have been thicker	1
Great	1
WOW, works great on all ants, here at the our Mini Ranch we had tons of fire, carpenter, piss ants, and those nasty black suckers that move real slow.  The extra large fire ants some mounds took two treatments, but they are gone, and I mean gone.  I have bought a ton of the so called best ant killers, this is worth every dime we paid for it, and our animals are no longer stung, nor are we, I am going to stock up on this before some fool finds a reason to want to protect ants from extension.	1
I first heard of this product when a Bayer representative gave a talk on pest control products  Even though this is not a Bayer product she said there was nothing better on the market for killing ants.  When a competitor praises another company's product it does make you think it must be good.  She also pointed out that it will kill all types of ants.  I like the fact that you do not have to water it in like some other products.  I used to buy it locally but the store stopped carrying it so I checked to see if Amazon could save me from the ants.  I was happy to find it. It works better than anything I have used for ants.	1
works good	1
I have a 110 acre ranch and have lots of ants.  I had tried almost every product on the market and was disappointed with them all.  Then by chance I found Bengal Fire Ant Killer on a dusty shelf of a small hardware store.  I thought since I've tried every product the big stores have, why not try this one.  WHAT A GREAT FIND THIS WAS!!!  IT TOTALLY WIPED OUT EVERY ANT MOUND I SPRINKLED IT ON, and quickly.  Now I'm on my way to see if the same hardware store has any more since I have many more mounds to cover with this dust.  All the other products did NOT work, and this product only requires one application with no water.	1
I had tried several different items from the store when I found this online.  It worked right away.  I bought it in august and haven't seen any fire ants in my backyard since.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to remove the ants from their yard.	1
This product works well, but I don't like the white powder everywhere.  Bengel has a concentrate I've used for years now.  Its easy to use and I'd recommend Bengal for your home and commercial pest control.	1
great	1
I have had a Band-It Edge Trimmer for many, many years.  I don't use it often, but it comes in handy when I do need it.  It works even better if you finally get around to putting in new blades!  Minor issue:  there are five blades, but the trimmer takes two.  So I'll either have one left over, or I'll have to buy another set, SOME day.	1
The blades themselves probably are fine. But I wasn't able to use them as the cutter was worthless for my project. I completely refaced 32 cabinets throughout my house, and you cannot use the trimmer unless there are no corners on the piece you are trimming. A sharp chisel worked very well for this job, better than any other method I tried.	-1
I had been buying hardware cloth in local hardware stores (Home depot and Lowes), but their price continued to increase, and the stuff was really hard to work with, so I thought I would give Amazon a chance to compete, and ordered this product from them. I was happy to discover that it was 100% easier to work with, and to cut to the sizes I needed, and since I had PRIME, (it got here in 2 days free shipping. When I totaled the cost of the mesh from the hardware stores, and the gas i needed to go get it, Amazon won the purchase, and saved me a buck or two,) as well as being very strong. I used it, to put around various places on the mobile chicken coops I had built, to keep the varmints out of the coop, and protect my chickens. It works great. I was so happy with it, that I ordered another one for another coop I had built. When I got the second one, I discovered it was not 1/2 inch hole size, but 1 inch instead. That was no big deal, so I just kept it and used it, but I would recommend that if you order it for a specific project, make sure it will work for that project when you get it. The larger holes that came in my second order, was OK for my use, no varmints were going to get through the 1 inch holes, so I had no problem.	1
Very high quality.	1
Great wire, economical and made great cages for my rabbits.	1
Works for what I needed it for. I use it to hold mulch between the fence and my gravel road, in an effort to stop the road from washing during a rain.	1
all used	1
I use this to keep the rabbits out of my strawberries and edemame.  So far so good.  It bends and holds new corners well.  Easier to handle with two people but I managed to unroll, cut and position it by myself.  Very sturdy.	1
Got this to build rabbit cages with. Very good quality wire and perfect for the rabbit cages.	1
I use this on all my rabbit pens and have very little problem with dropping getting stuck in the grid.	1
i got this at a very fair price at a time when i could not drive to the city to get more, which i desperately needed.  it arrived in one day, even though it was 2 day shipping.  very good deal!!	1
I bought this for my new deck, and hibachi.  It is just what I ordered and it works well.  If I had to do it over again I would order one size larger though, so that I would have more room.  The color matches good with my deck, and it is light enough, and has a handle, so that it is easy for us to pick up and store when not in use (although this change freaks out my dog who doesn't like changes).  I rated a 4 instead of a 5 only because I ordered a smaller size than on retrospect I would have preferred.  Can't blame them for that.	1
I did alot of research on many types of grill pads for my brand new Weber 22.5 charcoal grill.  This grill pad fits the bill perfectly, it has solid cement construction and looks fantastic under my new black grill, the colors offset each other perfectly, I only wish it was a little bigger, but otherwise I love this grill pad!!	1
Not fireproof, what what is it protecting against except maybe grease splats? Not worth the $$ I paid.	-1
Very good quality.  We've had it for a couple years now and it's good as new.	1
Just what I needed.  Got it quickly.	1
I bought this to use with my smoker when I built a new deck... I wanted to make sure that neither drippings or heat would affect the new composite decking material.  After reading lots of reviews, this appeared to be the best choice.  The pad works exactly as promised, and it appears durable enough to last a long, long time.  The top of the pad is rather rough, so don't step on it with bare feet.  It also scratches fairly easily, so make sure you don't scoot your smoker or grill around on the pad or you'll leave permanent markings.  From what I can see, the decking under the pad has not been adversely affected.  I'm not a big fan of the "handle" built in to the pad, although as rough as it is the handle ensures you can move it about without hurting your hands too much.  For protection on a deck that's durable and looks nice, I think this is the best choice I've found.	1
We use this for our fire pit to protect our Trex deck.  It works really well and protects the deck from discoloration, ashes, heat, etc.	1
This is just what I needed for underneath my outdoor fireplace to protect my wood deck.  Very nice and I would highly recommend!	1
Received product quickly, Pressure adjustments are good and easy. Can set flame higher for steaks. and lower for slow cooking.	1
My Weber Spirit 310 was a good grill but not hot enough. Its a serious grilling machine now.	1
Works fine but the control knob is a bit too touchy and is easily bumped/changed.	1
Revived my old grill!  Gives me the output I need for 5 burners.  Like the adjustable pressure.  Seems to work well.	1
My 10-yr Kenmore grill stopped working recently. The grill is still in good condition. I finally found out that the regulator is died. I tried suggested approach to "reset" regulator, but it didn't work. The replacement part costs near $60. Then, I bought King Kooker 04502, which works just fine. You can adjust regulator to meet your need (flame strength). Caution: you don't need very strong flame, which can damage your grill. My only complaint is that the valve does not have a lock to fix your adjustment. But, I used permanent marker to record my valve position.	1
I purchased this regulator because my fancy propane powered BBQ just wouldn't blast out enough BTU's. This was super easy to hook up, and the red adjuster dial helps to raise or lower the flames. Now I have an awesome BBQ and all of my friends have BTU envy now!	1
If you've never used poultry wire before you should be aware that the manufacturing process always damages the first and last foot or so on the roll, i.e., if you need exactly 25 feet for your project you must buy a roll with more than 25 feet on it.  $60 including shipping is a fantastic price for a 150 foot roll. Even if you don't need that much you should buy it for later use. You'll probably never see it that inexpensive anywhere else.  If you're working with poultry wire you need this&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/DEWALT-P7DW-Hog-Ring-Pliers-Kit/dp/B00I7PCF3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">DEWALT P7DW Hog Ring Pliers Kit</a>. You'll wonder how you ever got along without it.  Ed B.	1
Good wire, no rust and its been up several months....we live in Florida...high humidity and rain	1
Great price. No issues at all.	1
This is difficult to use, you need 3 hands and it shoots out so fast, would not buy again	-1
I use one of these to broadcast the various green manure/cover crop seeds I use. I have done Winter Rye, Clover and Hairy Vetch and it works well with all of them. I can cover a lot of ground quickly and get even  coverage(my garden area is 100 feet by 150 feet) and the unit is very well  built. the only drawback was that the shoulder strap was a bit too narrow  for carrying a full load of seed, but from the picture on this one it looks  like they have fixed that.	1
This thing worked one full summer and part of another. Works great when new but this is basically good for one  season of residential use.	-1
Works well	1
This is the 3rd one of these I have purchased over the years.  They hold up well and do the job.  I won't try any other brand.	1
good seeder bag	1
It holds a fair amount of product and spreads it nicely.  The only issue I have is the release knob is ungainly and the crank takes some getting used to.	1
Works well on multiple wildlife food plots	1
One of the best purchases I have ever made	1
Love these little spreaders.  This was a replacement for my old one that worked so well I couldn't see switching brands.	1
Great spreader at first. I keep it stored in my heated shed. Went to use it this year and it is completely locked up. Will not spin. Expensive spreader to only last that long.	-1
Im in the pest industry and it works	1
I use these alot. Wore out my previous seeders. The side wall to help keep the bag up while filling it solo is pretty useless. Closing the zipper is really tough when the bag is full as they just halve the fold  where the zipper would be when fully unzipped. Quick fix is stitch the zipper track up 1/4 inch so the zipper itself doesn bottom out when fully opened. I would buy another in a heart beat, but these would be some GREAT FIZES if they would address them......	1
good buy	1
Worked very well. Simple. Just use care with your hands since it is made of plastic. Gotta take care of it if you want it to last.	1
Easy to use, light-weight, does the job.  Have spread upwards of 250 lbs. of seed this fall with it	1
Great for  spreading grass seed, lime and fertilizer. I say some professional landscape people using one of these and had to have one. Amazon came through.	1
Very easy way to spread my lawn fertilizer efficiently!	1
Does what it is advertised.	1
The seeder worked fine. Had a little trouble getting familiar with the flow setting but through some trial and error I figured it out. Be sure to practice before you go live!!! You'll waste a lot of material if you don't.	1
This works just great! This replaced one of those plastic hold in your hand units - that was a pain in  the wrist - with the attached shoulder strap and crank down low it is very easy to use and clean. Very happy with this - easy to fill - easy to adjust flow rate - easy to crank and easy to clean	1
Distributes evenly and is very easy to use.  Could have used a larger capacity.	1
Cheap plastic construction. Slot/distribution control is cheap plastic and does not provide any precision control on distribution rate. I would not recommend this item to anyone. Look elsewhere; invest the $40 in a good push type spreader, or anything other than this thing.	-1
This is the only bag spreader that works properly.  All the others I have tried are trash.  This one is great for sowing lawn seed and spreading bug killer in flower gardens and other locations too rough for the lawn tractor spreader	1
Works great.	1
Good	1
I ordered this product based on the reviews to spead grass seed and fertilizer. I did not want to get the average consumer piece o crap handheld spreader or a bulky wheeled spreader thus... nylon bag spreader it is!  Overall I like this product, It is easy to use and does a nice job spreading. The bag is held up by two plastic fins that need to  be screwed into each end of the bag area upon receipt. I could tell they would not last long with the way they were made.. And on my second time using the spreader one of them broke off partially due to me letting it fall on the floor. Not the end of the world. Mostly made of plastic this is definitely not a commercial grade product but for my occasional use it has worked well and does not take up much space. I would purchase again.	1
This is a very practical and effective tool to spread any kind of seed over larger areas.	1
Works well. No issues as of yet	1
We use this for the business.  Works great.  Carries 25 lbs at a time.	1
Works for clover seed, I own three other spreaders, some very big, some normal, none can do clover seed, (small as salt), this does it and it's quick.	1
Works as described.	1
Have used this for seeds as large as peppercorns and as small as white clover...works just as well for all sizes.  Don't know why this model was discontinued by the manufacturer, but it apparently has been, so the price was lower.  Great buy if you can still find one...I expect it will outlast me.	1
Junk.  A worthless  product.	-1
Great product, fast shipping	1
My husband has bought or had me buy several seed spreaders and they always break within a short amount of time. So, I thought I would try this one out. He was a bit skeptical at first, but after using it, he really likes it. And, it's still working! If things change, I will update my review, but as of now, we are very happy with this purchase. The bag may seem a little different but it is actually a very nice design and takes some of the pressures off of your arms and wrists. Definitely would recommend!	1
as described.	1
I've been frustrated by the performance of my drop spreader from Scotts, which repeatedly clogged and NEVER dropped at the proper rate. The hand held broadcast spreader from Scotts was even worse. I finally wised up. I searched the product reviews, settled on this one, and spent just a bit more money.  If you want a hand-held spreader for home use, THIS IS THE ONE TO GET.  Trust the reviews. I'm glad that I did.	1
I used this spreader today for the first time.  The ease of use is totally A+.  The instruction enclosed in the  package was not so bright, but it didn't take me two days to figure out how to assemble the two enclosed plastic support.  It is so comfortable to hang this over my neck/shoulder as I crank it along.  I used this gadget to spread corn meal weed suppresser; and it worked so fast and easy.  The old plastic spreaders are obsolete.	1
This seeder works well, but like about all of them it is sort of cheaply made. Mostly plastic, but the bag seems tough.	1
This is the second one I've owned and I have not found any other hand-operated spreader that's even close. I actually purchased a different brand before this second spreader and gave it to my neighbor and ordered the Earthway that I previously owned. There are design improvements that make a huge difference. For instance, the other brand just fell over when loading or even just trying to stand it up. The Earthway spreader is designed to sit upright which makes loading far easier. Also if your left hand slips into the path of the star shaped spreader wheel of the other brand it is painful. The Earthway design is a circular wheel and doesn't hurt if your hand slips into it. The Earthway bag isn't canvas so it doesn't absorb any of the contents.  Unlike the other brand, the interior design of the Earthway doesn't have crevices where the bag attaches to the spreader so the contents don't get trapped in the interior.	1
works	1
Purchased this after I had a Scotts small green handheld spreader that did not work at all, this spreader works great!  The control for the opening works very well.  Very pleased, much better quality than the competition.	1
Great product and works well to spread seed and fertilizer in the yard.	1
Best hand spreader I used so far. Better than the Home Depot Scott one that breaks all the time and setting is way better than Home Depot Scott one and carrying it is easy and fits well. Glad I watch a YouTube vid of this first. Sold me	1
i like this bag spreader it is made heavy duty and works well with small seads	1
Just used it to spread 5 lbs of wildflower seeds. I mixed the seed with sand, per the seed instructions. This makes sense as it helped to separate the seeds for better dispersal.  This spreader was interesting. It works very simply. I was surprised. It looked complicated when it came out of the box.  The adjuster for rate was easy to figure out. It basically opens the hole larger, the larger the number. It has an adjustable tab that helps keep the setting in place. It did pop over it a few times. But I contribute that to not being familiar with using it.  Turning the handle, out came seeds spiraling out. It was awesome. Then I noticed it started to stop dispersing. I would shake the bag, thinking they were stuck, and it would redisperse.  Start dispersing again, then it would stop. Shake, redisperse, then stops. Still didn't figure out why this happened.  It was fun to use. I highly suggest wearing your pants over your boots (I don't recommend shoes, they would catch a lot of seed while doing this). It works, not sure what was going on while I was using it.  I might update when I have more cast seeds to disperse.  Maybe clover? :)	1
This thing works great! The thing I like is that you don't have to move fast like pushing those cart type spreader where you have to practically run to get them to sling the seed out, you can walk at your own pace and crank as needed..easy for anyone to use.	1
Needed a better seeder than the under $10 one I thought would work (binds up all the time) anyway the Earthway 2750 meets the need for a quality product. Should have skipped trying to not sped a little more for quality...	1
This spreader is very easy to use and works well (unlike high volume, $15 ones that are junk).  The easy-to-adjust opening varies from a very thin slot to a rather wide one and there is a shuttle about the same width as the slot which rotates back and forth a bit as the handle is cranked making sure the seed or fertilizer is evenly fed to the slot.  The opening adjustment is readily loosened via a thumb screw and there are clear markings so it can be reliably changed.  The fertilizer pattern is fixed (not adjustable) at about 180 degrees (half circle) to the front.  There are two flat plastic bag supports that must each be slightly curved and secured with a supplied Philips screw.  This just takes a few minutes to put into place.  While the bag supports are not absolutely necessary, they are very helpful while pouring fertilizer into the bag.  The strap is easy to clip and unclip on one end and is comfortable and plenty long to hold the spreader on the shoulder.  The cranking mechanism feels well made and I think this spreader should give many years of good service.  It appears the parts coming in contact with the fertilizer are all plastic, so cleanup is fast and corrosion should be minimal.  Nice design!!	1
I used to use the old canvas bag spreaders on the farm 40 plus years ago and am really pleased with this spreader. It works very well and covers a large area. It does a MUCH better job than any of the hand, tow, or push circular spreaders and for uniformity as well. If you are inexperienced with this type of spreader you should experiment some before actually using it. One thing you should learn to do is place the spreader more on the right side of your body and start cranking the handle at a smooth even rate before you begin moving. Once you are ready open the door and start walking and close the door before you stop cranking. This will give you a uniform start and stop pattern and also put less stress on the gears. The reason you put the spreader more on the right side of the body is twofold. Firstly it is much more comfortable and secondly it shifts the pattern more to the right side. This is important as it gives you much better control of the left edge of your pattern allowing you to put your fertilizer or seed right where you want it without having to use a drop spreader. Choose a cranking speed that is comfortable for you as that will also help give you a constant pattern. Making sure the spreader is clean and the gears sprayed with silicone when you are finished should give you a lifetime of good service from this spreader.	1
Does a great job.  Easy to use.  Bought as a replacement for an identical spreader that was eaten by a bush hog.	1
It takes some practice to use this device, but not that much practice is required, and it allows you to very quickly spread fertilizer or bug killer or seed over a large area. It came with some pieces of plastic sheeting intended to keep the bag upright. I was unable to install these, but it did not prevent me from effectively using the device. This is the best product of its type that I have used.	1
I grew up using an old hand seeder with a cotton bag and cheap zipper (like the Yard Tough model or the $20 model from Tractor Supply). It still works to this day, but the zipper broke, the gears are worn out, and it is very easy to beat the heck out of your hand as the spinner tabs that sling the seeds/product stick out beyond the round plate.  On this model the zipper looks very sturdy, you can order replacement parts if needed, it has bag supports so the bag doesn't fall down on you while you use it, the strap is easily adjustable and reasonably comfortable. Yesterday I spread 175lbs seed, organic fertilizer and calcium. If you put the strap over your head and on the opposing (right) shoulder, it will only be mildly uncomfortable. If you put it on your left shoulder, it will ache very quickly.  As others say, start walking and cranking then release the seed. It isn't perfect, but it works very well and allows you to vary cranking speed to walking speed easily to adjust your seeding rate.  This product is great for flat lawns, and especially fantastic for uncleared areas--I have a large power line right of way full of brambles. I can spread seed in fall/spring and it will get a good start and then bushhog, weedeat, or sick the goats on it periodically and the grass is already established, works quite nicely and after a year there is nice grass from nothing be vines, thorns and mess.  The biggest pro of this spreader over a push model is that it is SMALL. You don't have to store a massive spreader that only works well on even ground and you use 1-2x a year. You can't really use a push spreader to spread salt in the winter with snow, but this works great!  My lawn treatment was a full core aeration followed by application of 75lbs of grass seed (50lbs Kentucky 31, 25lbs of localized shade mix from local landscape supply co.), 50 lbs of mycorrhizal fertilizer (does wonders on hard-packed clay), and 50lbs of high calcium Solu-Cal to bump pH up and raise plant-available calcium. This will help the new grass grow and help existing desired grasses outperform crab grass. Really looking forward to some good rain to get the ball rolling on a revitalized lawn for this summer!	1
Works fine, mostly plastic, flings seed a good 20ft and carries a good load of seed, just let up on the feed trigger before you stop cranking or seed will pour out.	1
I have been very pleased with how well it performs! It also seems to be built very well! I would recommend this product to anyone! Thank you very! much	1
Just received my new Earthway. Unlike my old Earthway, everything except the bag, crank handle, and volume adjustment is made of plastic.  I can now use it with fertilizer without disassembling, scraping, and oiling the sliding metal parts every year like on the old one. Nice additions are the two plastic bag supports that hold the bag open to make filling it easier.  Someone in customer service was obviously listening to customer comments over the past 10 years.   I have no idea if it will be more or less durable; I'll write a follow up review in a few years.	1
Doesn't clog.  You can control how much is spread.  This works really well for seed or for salt in the winter.	1
spreader/seeder is easy to assemble . It also broadcasts  a nice, uniform wide path of material. Can cover larger areas quickly	1
I like this because it is compact for storage.  It seems to be durable and I think it will last a long time.  Installing the screws was confusing at first.  They are inside the bag screwed in the black bottom.  You have to unscrew them and get the parts in there just right to screw them in.	1
This spreader will cover more ground, faster, with less hassle, for less money than anything I've tried.  I've been using spreaders for 40 years.  I've used several of the kinds that roll on the ground and broadcast.  They're slow because they're low to the ground and the seed (or fertilizer) hits the ground before it can go very far.  Also, you can't vary the spin rate independently of your walking rate (as I explain later).  I've used rolling drop spreaders, and while they are very precise, they are even slower than rolling broadcasters because they cover such a narrow path.  I do use them for seed to cover areas close to beds so that I can avoid growing grass in the beds.  Until I got this spreader, the fastest things I'd used were the old hand-carried, wood-and-metal-and-canvas broadcast spreaders.  They had two problems.  When you filled them you had to have help because the canvas top would bend, and the whole thing would flop over and spill.  If you used fertilizer in them they would last one season before they corroded so badly, they were useless.  They were cheap, and they were very fast, and a lot of pros used them for seed and even fertilizer.  I used them because they were fast, but lately I haven't seen them in the stores, probably because people kept beating up the retailers over the corrosion problem.  Then, from Amazon, I got a very expensive, hand-carried broadcast spreader call the Solo.  Terrible choice.  It didn't fall over, and it didn't corrode, but it was slow as molasses in the winter and didn't spread evenly.  It was also very hard to use without catching your finger in the mechanism.  It didn't hold a lot either.  I hated it.  My neighbor had a huge, heavy, pro-grade handheld broadcaster that worked pretty well, didn't fall over, and didn't corrode.  I used it once.  I lift weights, but this thing was terribly unwieldly.  I actually tried several times to find one at the Farmer's Supply where he said he got it, and I never could.  Now I'm glad I didn't.  I've used the little one-handed scoop-shaped spreaders you find a Home Depot et al.  They are fine for sprinkling seed on spots, but they're too small for full yards.  You'd do better spreading by hand out of a bag.  And then along comes the Earthway 2750.  It does everything the old hand-carried, wood-and-metal-and-canvas broadcast spreaders would do, only better in terms of smooth cranking and speed variability.  It won't corrode (although I do worry about one little screw).  It doesn't flop over for two reasons:  (1) it has vertical plastic pieces you install in the front and back of the bag to hold it up;  (2) it has a wide, very stable base to keep the whole thing from tipping over.  The zipper on top is a nice touch to ensure that it doesn't spill when you're hoisting it onto your shoulder.  It costs a lot less than the Solo and will cover a yard more evenly in about 20 percent of the time.  Now, let me manage expectations.  If you've never used a hand-held broadcast spreader before, don't fill it all the way up the first time.  You especially don't want to fill it all the way up with heavy fertilizer.  Once it's loaded, start out gingerly.  Prop it against your stomach to get it out in front of you.  You vary the width of the path that you sow by how fast you turn the crank (which slings the seed out).  The amount that you put down per square yard depends on three things:  (1) how far back you pull the left-hand lever; (2) how fast you walk; and (3) how fast you crank (because that varies the width).  It is not like learning to ride a bicycle, but it does take getting used to.  Once you get the hang of it (punny) you'll find it gives you wonderful control -- far more than any rolling spreader.  Okay, I read the review from the person who said she got the fertilizer all over her.  I just walked in from using it, and I don't have a particle of fertilizer on me, but I certainly understand how it can happen.  Before you fill it up the first time, hold it in position and walk while turning the crank.  Pull back the left (valve or throttle) lever and look down to see what the valve in the bottom is doing.  Get comfortable doing that much first.  Next, fill it about 1/4 full.  Start walking and cranking BEFORE you open the valve.  Open it slowly.  If you do this, I predict you'll be totally successful the first time out and not waste a bit of seed or fertilizer.  I also read the review from the guy who broke his spreader.  I was concerned by that.  The only way I can see that happening would be if you tried to  strong-arm the crank.  Just spin it up gently before you open the valve.  If you try to spin it up fast when it's clogged with fertilizer, you could stress the mechanism.  If you are using pelletized fertilizer, you're going to need to break up any clumps.  Follow these suggestions, and I'll be very surprised if you break it.  ***Update***  I've now been using this spreader for over a year, and I'm still sold on it.  It still works like new.  Good luck! Tim	1
Good lightweight spreader for moderate size jobs.  Price was reasonable via Amazon. Would recommend for lime spreading, grass seeding, fert etc. Over the shoulder construction. Washable.	1
I purchased this to replace an older different brand. I have a family member who owns one of these and has been very pleased with it. I have only used it twice so far but I think it will be a great product	1
Bought one of these to replace one of those junky plastic spreaders that hold only about 1-2 pounds of lime/fertilizer. This one holds alot more and spreads is better and faster. Saves me so much time and effort.	1
The Earthway seed spreader was promptly delivered and is of good quality. Have spread over 100 pounds of grass seed and I suspect it will last many seasons.	1
Second one purchased, the company has made some remarkable improvements.  Works well, light and easy to operate.  Highly recommend easy to fill and function	1
Have owned numerous towable fertilizer spreaders and a cheaper, flimsy, handheld model. Used one like this years back to apply seed around a lake and liked it. This thing works great with 10-10-10 fertilizer that has no clumps in it. Applied 40 lbs. with my towable model a few weeks back. Then, put down another 40 lbs. today with this model on the spots I missed. This thing worked much better than I expected it to applying fertlizer. Was able to control it (where fertilizer went) much better than with the aggravating towable models. It is the easiest to use as far as I'm concerned. Walked at an easy pace and it is not hard to crank for a good broadcast. All spreaders are somewhat challenging and can be aggravating but this one just became my favorite. Now for the REAL challenge: keeping the fertilizer from making it rust. Will wash it well and soak it with silicone spray. Then, keep an eye on it in storage. Rust is what will eventually kill it.  After washing it clean, don't see that many exposed metal parts. Fertilizer has a way of finding its way throughout a spreader to rust them from the inside out. This spreader works well.  April 2013: Used it again to apply some coated time release fertilizer. It worked more smoothly than with 10-10-10. The silicone spray worked. Saw no rust anywhere on it. It appears to have nylon gears which will not rust. That's good as far as I'm concerned using it for fertilizer. With cranking it fast, can get a broad broadcast or slow down and have more ccontrol. Worth the price- I like it. It's much easier to use and control than my towable broadcast spreader.  July 2014: Used it to apply some fire ant control granules (granular insecticide like sawdust). Was able to attain a very light broadcast by controlling the flow as I walked with it. In areas with heavy fire ant populations, opened the valve a little more. It worked well.  May 2015: Bought 40 pounds of weed and feed to apply. Found this spreader stored about 1/3 full with fire ant granules from last Summer. So, got a jump on the fire ants this year where I definitely want them gone. Then, applied the weed and feed. Have not taken good care of this spreader yet it is still working well. The handle now has some rust on it but that does not affect its function.  Need to clean it up some with water and some silicone spray. It's holding up well against the rust promoting fertilizer compounds I have used in it. The internal gears still work smoothly- like new. Could have used my towable spreader but this one is my favorite for a 3/4 acre lawn. With this one, get more of whatever I'm using on my body and shower immediately after using it but have much better control of what I'm applying.	1
I have a 1/2 acre lot in Fl. And my lawn looks like a carpet because I do my own Fert, and weed control. I love this spreader. It has the best control for fert placement. It is so much better than a push type. I have had mine for about 6 years and the fabric started coming off the plastic, so I put some small self tapping screws in to hold it in. Keep in mind fert is loaded with salt and all kinds of stuff so i'm not suprised it seperated after 6 years. I will buy another one when this one totaly falls apart. Much faster than a push type. And alot less work!	1
Works great. Has great dispersion. I would have given it FIVE starts except I got a very bad skin rash from the Ortho grass seed powder. Next time I will wear a windbreaker no matter how hot it is. I start with the bottom on top and I start craking the wheel. THEN I lower the scatter wheel downward while still cranking. It's a FIVE START product ... the grass seed or chemicals inside were the problem. I already wrote on the outside of the bag to wear a windbreakers and take a shower right after using it.	1
This seeder is fantastic. Holding 7 pounds of seed is a great idea. Fill it up and go. I love not having to go back to the seed bag countless times only to start where I left off. This cut my time down and kept my pattern uniformed. Buy it. You won't regret it.	1
If this is NOT the product pictured (The Jet blue filter) the photo should be changed because the ad is deceptive!	-1
Does what it is supposed to do.  Good for the money.	1
It seems that the Jet filter size is just a little bit different than what you can get as a furnace filter replacement.  However, I clean the unit with my shop vac several times before it becomes apparent that it is time to replace.	1
Jet filters are pricey. I was pleased when it arrived (well packed) and looked just like the original. Fits perfect.	1
i was using a halogen light before but this light is alot better. i did a time lapse video using both lights and there is a huge difference in growth just within a 5 hour period. it's pretty light and easy to set up. i highly recommend this light to any first time grower.	1
Arrived quickly, no damage. Lightweight to hang. I like the integrated ballast because I just didn't want to mess with electrical components. Its very bright when it gets warmed up. It works great for a small area, or just one orchid or two. Its recommended for 2 sqft, so as long as you have a space that size its very effective. Some of my leaves got sunburned because they were not used to the HID light, so I recommend hanging light about 3 ft away then adjusting as time goes on. My only problem with this light is that Im already looking to upgrade, turns out I need 8 sqft. But it's a good buy for the price.	1
the footprint for these hoods is PERFECT!	1
to hot,to noisy,disapointed	-1
nice large Reflector	1
this is the best reflector ever had you definitely have to run 1000 watt bulbs because its so large but it cools very well and you save like 8 inches in height because of the low pro set up which doesn't sound like a lot but in a 78 inch tent its a lot. the only thing ide like to see is this in a double ended bulb that would be excellent but I would definitely recommend this to anyone in the market and side not it doesn't fit in a 4x4 tent that well because of air ports	1
These are incredible lights for two plant grows you will not disappointed but you might want more of them!	1
Godly	1
Can't beat the value	1
even came with a ;level, only complaint is amazon added zero padding to the box, it had plenty of powder coated white paint missing only on top thou.	1
shipped quickly and works great !	1
died in a week	-1
Fantastic.  I use it at the end of two strip lights to get my tomatoes, eggplant, and Peppers ready for the garden.  They plants look great inside.  When I take them outside they are bigger and ready for sunlight.  It does put off some heat but I use a small fan which also helps the plants to get stronger.  Not really big enough for my big basil pots but since the squirrels are wrecking my basil, I'll give them a go next week and see if I can get them strong enough to survive the attack of the squirrel.	1
Work great in a 2x2 Grow Tent. Not too heavy to hang and produces sufficient light to keep things growing rapidly...	1
Great	1
Great product and service	1
This my first experience with HID Lights and I'm impressed with the way my indoor garden in responding. My plants look like its summertime and are now setting fruit while indoors LOL!. Be smart and buy some HPS glasses to protect your eyes, the type of light makes my eyes hurt while watering my garden. This light does generate some heat and it needs to be at least 12 inches above the vegetation due to radiant heat. Otherwise this is a GREAT light for indoor growing.	1
Flickering coming from the light disturbs me because I can get migraines from flickering lights.  I put up a shade between the garden window and room which solved that problem but the vegetable plants I raised from seed are spindly and are still reaching toward the outside sun.  When I moved the light closer to the plants the heat became too intense.  Not satisfied with this light.	-1
Best reflector i have owned yet. great quality and superior product to any i have had in the past. Glass is removable, solid construction overall. all hardware was included, light socket as well. I got the 6 inch version and fits a 100 watt HPS bulb very nicely. Lighter than some others i have hung in my garden but the light pattern is far superior. I will most likely replace my big Kauna with another one of these. Beware that this does not come discreetly packages it does have a label on the outside of the box showing what it is as well as a picture of the reflector on that label. This did not matter to me but i know discretion is a problem for some	1
Just wanted to let everyone know, this is a fantastic product. Not much heat. One small circulating fan and the room stays the proper temperature. If you have a small area you need to grow some amazing tomatoes in this is the light for you!	1
great value. very bright. good quality.  You have to have very good air flow, or a fan, or a way of cooling the plants/area off. This light gets pretty dang hot. remeber that lumens increase drastically as they get closer to the plant, closer to the plant, the hotter this thing will make it=need fan.	1
If you have a 48" x 48" grow tent this is the reflector you want.  You can find cheaper but you get what you pay for.  Also, it is not double ended, which, IMO, is a good thing.	1
Great hood watch your plants definitely puts out  some serious rays	1
Great light, just wish it was a DE bulb, next one will be.	1
This light is very powerful for the wattage.  I had it in a small grow tent and all my cattleya's got sunburn!	1
I read that a combination of LED and HPS lights is optimal for flowering growth, so I really wasn't looking for any of the stronger 400+ watt HPS lights that are pretty common. The lower wattage of this light was perfect for combining with my UFO LED grow lights since my grow area is small and would heat up too much from a stronger light. This light doesn't run too hot and only raises the temperature in the room 1 to 5 degrees. It is fairly bright and is warmer in color which is great for flowering. The only thing that I dislike about the light is that the ballast is a little heavy and the hooks that come with it are pretty flimsy which makes it difficult to hang securely. If you do use the hooks that come with the light, make sure its positioned somewhere that it won't get bumped into too hard, otherwise the whole fixture may drop. (I've caught it every time so far at least!)	1
They don't come much better than this HPS 150 Watt grow light.  The price is right and it functions just as indicated. Comes properly packaged against damage with the bulb packed separately.  Made in China, it arrived on time. I have this same wattage and fixture in CFL, so I'll get to try them against each other.	1
This was very professionally made and packaged.  Problem for me was that in my confined space (2x3x6 cabinet) it was generating way too much heat.  I did not want to upgrade my fan, nor did I want the amount of heat this generates to build up if I lost my fan while away.  So I sadly had to return it.  This is much more suitable to a bigger space like a tent or 4x4 room than a closet.	1
Has worked reliably for me for, have had it about 6 months now.	1
4x4 garden very pleased think I heard plants applauding when it lit up	1
Third one and every single one has shown up with a very damaged box. Other then that I like them.	1
a little heavy, but oh my goodness gracious, such a killer hood	1
I bought this light over a year ago I don't know if it was a fluke but I only paid 49.99 for the whole unit? Was blown away when it arrived as I was expecting just a hood for that price, I've been using this light with no problems what so ever? Strikes hortilux blue metal halide even....now I see the price has went through the roof I'll continue to buy units separately as I can still get a lumetek lk 400-250 switchable ballast off of e bay for 30.00 dollars as I just did and the hood complete with sockets and cords for 21.00.....but all in all this light is still worth what their asking for it, it's been a great light for me	1
Very nice fixture. Light weight. Had been using a friend's ancient one. This one is so silent compared to the old one. To be switchable mh to hps, and 250/400, you have everything you need in one ballast.	1
Great product!	1
Runs a little hotter than I expected but works great. Been 3 months still running with no issues with the original bulb.	1
Works ok. But cant find replacement bulbs. So u gota buy a wole new fixture for a bulb. My bulb burnt out in the 2nd week	-1
Great product for the price...assembled easily with the instructions and performs well.	1
Great hood. Vents well and has a good spread for 600w	1
awesome 150w grow light hot but not to hot,my seedlings love it buying another one for my veggies.	1
Super sweet so far stoked to check out the results will be back later for an update	1
Five stars for the lights, zero stars for the shipping. I bought three of these and one was in a brown box, the other two just had a shipping label on them with the most non-discreet packaging I've ever seen in my life. Pictures of the light and big text all over it, including "INCREASE YIELDS!" Horribly executed. Make sure to check the option to have this shipped in some kind of box or gift packaging if you're gonna buy these lights on Amazon.  Aside from that like I said these lights are absolutely great. I used to have a tube lights, these appear to be 2x brighter at least the light spread on these is amazing.	1
Suprisingly effective with reasonable heat production.	1
Works surprisingly well once I got the knack of just how to use it.  Really removes the deep root nicely on large weeds.	1
Huge results , in a big way. This a must buy if you're serious about indoor gardening. My cucumbers, berries, and beans just soak up the output from my 600 watt Ushio OptiRed.	1
A great hood for the price	1
I love the double sealed glass.  Pretty good value for the money!	1
I really like this little light. It is nothing special, but with the internal ballast, it is pretty darn easy to use. I currently have it in a 16"x16"x48" tent with 1 flower under it. At 0.58 watts per square inch, it gets pretty warm, but with proper exhaust/ventilation it is easily manageable.	1
I have a growtent that 2 of these work perfect in. Low heat . For the price I'm getting a couple more.	1
Inexpensive approach to growing 2-3 modest sized plants - fairly quiet, not particularly hot, on second crop of plants at 4 months which have done very well (read the instructions re. adjusting plant to light distance, and change it as the plants grow).  To achieve well rounded plants it's better to mount 2 lights overhead.  I've mounted them via adjustable pulleys (available in same area of Amazon as the lights, as are the timers) from a curtain rod which cant the lights at 45 degrees (one side of light lower than other) to hit the plants with light from 2 sides, and rotate the plants every few days for 180 degree light exposure - so, mimicking in crude form the sun's rotation across the sky.  Such assures the plants leaf out symmetrically, and don't grow tall without decent understructure (i.e., not reaching for solely overhead light like a pine tree in a thick forest).	1
Fantastic hood, I have two of them, they are huge, easy to put together.	1
I have not actually hung this hood yet, but I can tell I am going to like it an awful lot after I briefly tested it out.........  I was worried whether my powerful Maxlite 200 watt CFL bulbs(12,000 lumens) would fit in this hood and they seem to do just fine in there....with plenty of clearance......  Apparently this fixture also will fire an HPS bulb but I am not sure what size HPS bulb(200 watts I assume maybe) one would use and what size ballast I would have to acquire......  After I have hung, and completely tested, this light for a while, I envision upgrading my rating to five stars......	1
Great light for sun loving plants.  I have this over our Mexican Bird of Paradise which grows in desert conditiions in the west.  Living in the mi-west means I have to take in tropicals and any other cold weather sennsitive plants.  I bought this so that we can contiinue to enjoy this plant and it is still flowering inside while under this light.  The plant dislays new growth and is in great condition in our warm basement next to a radiator.	1
Awesome box, I know that sounds silly but the box was sized right to do the job and keep the thing protected. If I were growing what most people buy this thing for I would be sure to get it gift wrapped the next time I buy it since discretion is everything in that business. This reflector works very well and is a personal favorite, much higher preference to these than the cool tubes. This is built well, should it ever fall the glass is tempered so it will shatter rather than come off in large dangerous pieces and there's enough housing that your bulb shouldn't burst even if it fails (personal experience). The few people I know who like Cool Tubes over such hoods, claim the cool tubes are easier too cool; and these people know little to nothing about thermal mass, let alone conduction and convection.  Thanks iPower & Amazon for fast delivery of a good product. My Cucumbers are happy again!	1
I bought this under a recommendation from a book that liked it but I found that it is too hot and will burn a tomato plant if left less that two feet away. This would be a good system for keeping baby birds warm but not for plants. My brother raises chickens and he will be getting this for Christmas from me. If I had a green thumb I would give this a chance.	1
This quietly and efficiently kept my plants alive and thriving indoors during this last winter.	1
great light for flowering.  Good to use as a side light for taller plants.	1
Amazing!!!!! Dynamite really does come in small packages. Outstanding grow light. Wouldn't recommend for more than 4 plants.	1
All I can say is wow	1
I love it.	1
Like the sun dog	1
I was so impressed I bought a second one. I've owned numerous hps and mh lamps up to 1000w for over 15 years. I usually prefer the higher output lamps, but the single piece with ballast is very convenient, and the ability to spread the lumens over a wider area with multiple lamps allows for flexible layouts.	1
Great light!	1
Just fine, thank you.	1
Costly but well worth it. The quality and design of the reflector is just awesome. I will say you pay for the awesomeness and if you are on a tight budget a simple cheaper gull wing reflector is the best value, but this thing is just lovely. The heat deflector is sold separate FYI, and most don't like it as it will cast a noticeable shadow in the middle of the dispersal pattern. I find this acceptable as distance to canopy and heat are a large factor for my flowering room. All in all 10/10. Will buy more.	1
Great	1
just what the doctor ordered...LOL great hood!	1
Perfect Small herb garden light, nothing wrong with it. Quality light!	1
this thing will light up a 4x4 area very very well with  600w hps. only issue is with the giant label on one side of the box it is shipped in said Grow Light. arrived in 1 puece. no broken parts or dents.	1
Very bright great for getting your veggie seeds a head start	1
This is keeping a large geranium and a huge catnip plant looking very healthy in early January. For this part of the country (NY) that's saying something.	1
Very happy, at this price it's hard to be unhappy at all. Shipped quicker than expected, clean bulb pre installed and thoughtfully packaged with care. Peppers love this light's sun-like-glow and warmth. Helps keep my peppers warm in the space over the garage. I can say with confidence it will grow anything that can fit under it at about 12-18" from plant tops in maybe a 4x4 area. Combined with LEDs to get incredible results. A+	1
Using it as a refugium light for my reef tank. Grows macro(I'm using cheato) like crazy.. It's nit the first time I've used horticultural lighting on a saltwater fuge, but this tiny(excellent because it's a very, very small system) light packs a nice punch!  It heats the water very little as mine is sitting directly on the fuge tank and my overall temp only increased by .2 degrees(50 long DT and 20 high fuge). But it did increase my night pH nicely, so the system stays at at least 8.26 at night(from 8.19) and 8.31 during the day..  For the light it puts it, it's also insanely inexpensive when you consider other fuge options. One thing I would suggest since it does put out so much light, is a piece of smoked or black acrylic to shade your skimmer if it is in the same area.. The device puts out that much light! Excellent light and I suggest highly!	1
Items came as promised, very satisfied with shipping and definitely recommend doing business with this seller. .items were new and beautiful :)	1
Beautiful reflector at an even better price!!! Easy to change bulbs and clean the glass. I want more :))	1
A++++	1
Sun System HPS 150 Grow Light Fixture - Shipping Was fast and very safe, everything came as described. this grow light is great for a small tent or closet, covers a 2 x 2 area pretty well, noticed major improvement of plant growth in only a week, recently was using a single 65w CFL bulb.	1
Solidly built, worked as expected, and delivered quickly. Highly recommended.	1
I waited a long time to write this review I did not get one mushroom from this patch. I will never waste my money again!	-1
Seems like a good product and we actually did get a few Shitake's from it... but not nearly as many as you'd expect.  Yes, we re-read the instructions and yes, we tried it several times (5 times) with the same results.  Entertaining for my kids the first time, but after several failures they lost interest and my wife continued to buy Shitake's at the grocery store.  I am pretty certain we won't do it again.	-1
Be aware that nowhere on the website does it say that this item must be opened and used within 30 days.  However, that information was printed on the box so when I received it I called the company to determine if that 30 days is simply a "recommended to be used by" date (I wanted to give it as a Christmas gift).  They informed me that while there could possibly be a 5-7 day "grace" period, the 30-day limit is pretty firm.  The company will not refund or exchange this item. I'm sure this is a good product but be sure you are planning to open and start it growing immediately.	-1
This cover is WAY TOO TIGHT.  It takes all my strength to get it over the grill itself, and in the process of coaxing it on, the inside of the cover becomes filthy once the grill has been used.  Also, I bought it so that I could store the grill on the patio, but that is not recommended by the manufacturer of the grill even if the grill is covered.  It's therefore one of the most useless products I've bought recently.	-1
The quality looked good. Heavy material and strong elastic - but I had to return this item. It took two people to stretch it out enough to fit over the grill. The fit was just too snug. Now I use a black 30 gallon garbage bag. Keeps grill dry and no hassle.	-1
Fits my Lodge well.  Faded rather quickly.  My gas grill cover did not fade and is older than this one.	-1
Somehow, it still lets the grill get rusty...	-1
After less than a month on my deck, the cover had faded to a silver color.  It makes me wonder if it will self-destruct before I put the grill away for the winter.  Not too happy about the appearance at this point. But it does fit well.	-1
Disappointing-to much cracked corn/millet and not enough seed	-1
too much millet and other "stuff"	-1
I purchased the Stokes Select Thistle Tube Bird Feeder with Six Feeding Ports, Yellow, 1.6 lb Capacity from Amazon several months ago and the finches (yellow and brown) loved eating their Audobon Brand Yellow Finch Feed from it. I purchased this LebanonTurf Brand 2647408 Lyric Yellow Finch Wild Feed from Amazon...and the finches land on the feeder, take a few pecks...then fly away. I use to go through over two pounds of feed a week. With this product my feeder has remained full for going on three weeks. I can't return it because the package has been opened. I love purchasing products from Amazon...but this product was a complete waste of time and money. I'm glad other people have rated this product so high...it's why I felt safe buying it. But the finches here in my neighborhood hate it. Maybe I got a bad bag...but not being able to return it for a refund will definitely keep me from giving another bag a try.	-1
This is a very well made. but with the diameter of the top of the rack and a beer can, it is too large to fit into the cavity and balance the bird.	-1
Beer Can Chicken is a great idea...taste great.  This is my second rack...first one was from Fox Run [...]  This rack from Bayou Classic is very dingy looking compared to the one from Fox Run. But the bigger disappointment is the size of the opening. I bought a stainless steel tumbler to replace the beer can.  The openning in the Bayou Classic is just a hair more narrow which prevents the my stainless steel shaker from dropping thru to the bottom.  They both will hold a can, and they both are made from identical scetches. But the fox run is better looking, better quality, and just a hair larger opening and maybe a dollar cheaper.  I have oe of each (Fox Run, and Bayou Classic) and if I order more for gifts, it will be the one from Fox Run.  "Winware Stainless Dredge 10 ounce" is the stainless steel container that will fit into the fox run rack but will NOT fit into this rack. <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Winware-10-Ounce-Stainless-Dredge/dp/B001CIELI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Winware 10-Ounce Stainless Dredge</a> <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fox-Run-Beer-Can-Poultry-Roaster/dp/B000XU5D04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fox Run Beer Can Poultry Roaster</a>	-1
Bought this for a fire pit, it got charred the first time I used it. Wouldn't buy it again or recommend it.	-1
This rack (like many others of its kind) is just bent wire that is welded together. When I received the first of these racks, one of the welds looked "sketchy," and, sure enough, it was cracked. I sent it back to Amazon and am awaiting arrival of a new one. However, given the poor quality control demonstrated in the first one, even if the new one arrives intact, I'm skeptical about how long it will last once it's put into service. Not a good first impression!	-1
Not what I expected!  Flames do not keep well! Adjusted and to no results. It is a product problem not amazon fault!	-1

I really wanted to like these gloves for my 2 boys (ages 9 & 5)...great price, great reviews...and when they arrived, they felt like a "quality" product.  I originally ordered 2 of the 7-11 sizes since my 5 year old has paws for hands, but it was too big for him and also I noticed the design of the finger holes on both gloves was all wrong.  If you look at your hands, your middle & ring finger are slightly further out from your palm giving your hand a "curved" look.  Most cheaper gloves do not tailor this "curve" into their gloves, but the finger holes are long enough it doesn't really matter.  The 2 gloves I first received had finger holes half the length they should have been and the "curve" of the glove assumed your pointer finger was the closest to the palm and a diagonal line to the pinky area (it's finger hole started where your pinky knuckle is).  My 9 year old got them filthy before I realized a drunk person sewed the gloves, so I couldn't return them....threw them in the trash (yes, the design is that bad!).  Returned the gloves for my younger son and went with the smaller size.  Same fliptarded design of the finger holes, only this time the person who sewed them was even more drunk and rather than sewing the elastic band in the wrist area while it was stretched (sew it when it is stretched out so when you release it bunches up and gives the elastic fit)...they just sewed it in flat so the gloves have no elastic bunching at the wrist area.  Extremely poor quality control and poor design...the gloves feel like a quality leather, but in reality they are the cheapest leather (more like raw leather, suede like feel) and are super thick with no flexibility.  I know leather gloves soften over time, but you can't soften these because there are super thick seams sewn all throughout the inside also making them super uncomfortable.  My suggestion...spend a few more bucks for some better quality.  Uncomfortable gloves with no flexibility can lead to injuries if your child is working with sharp objects.	-1
I ordered 2 of the Banjo Burners. One installed only after redrilling mounting holes since not symmetrical. The other arrived with stripped threads. Had to return and waiting on replacement. So I guess 50/50 not so bad.	-1
I bought two of these for a single tier homebrew setup I've been working on with a fabricator. One of these was workable but the other the burner second jet and air control isn't threaded right. The burner is either threaded too big or the fitting is made too small. What a joke and waste of money. I've seen review after review about Bayou Classic warning about poor quality and consistency of threadings/weldings and believed I was immune. I was wrong. Now I am stuck with a $60 burner that I can't use.	-1
This is not as described in the listing. What was in the box is rated at 10psi not the 20 that is in the product description.  There is no way to increase the flow to 20psi.	-1
THIS PRODUCT WAS WAY TOO BIG AND I HAD TO PAY FOR THE DARN SHIPPING TO SEND IT BACK. THATS KAKA	-1
DO NOT buy this unit for turkey frying!  I got it because really liked the fact that it is square and low to the ground, so it looks much more stable than a round one.  However, the regulator is only a 5 psi.  The oil never got hotter than 250 degrees in ideal conditions (no wind, 45 degrees outside, etc), turkey frying is best done at 325 degrees.  For that you have to have a 10 psi regulator. The 10 psi is offered in the SP10 unit (which is cheaper than this one anyway). The company confirmed all the above information, so you know it's not just my opinion, the facts are the facts. Really disappointed that this information isn't pointed out in the product description.  Returning it, but could've saved myself a lot of trouble by buying the right one in the 1st place.  Hopefully I'm saving you that trouble now.	-1
It kept blowing out and was hard to get the air fuel mix right.  I just noticed the metal cap for adjusting air does not fit around the cast burner and is causing a massive air leak.  I will have to machine down the casting to allow the air door to sit flush without leaks.  It probably will work correctly after that, but it is too hot to fix right now.	-1
The flame is almost impossible to see during the day which makes adjusting the air intake to get the perfect blue flame very difficult.  This is probably not as much of a issue if you have lots of shade or use it during the night.  Turning the on/off dial up causes the flame to easily blow itself out with no safety mechanism to shut off the gas.  The frame and the cooking surface work great.	-1
Pot is way too small for a 12lb turkey let alone the 18lbs it claims.  Thermometer is off by at least 50 degrees.	-1
This brought my pot of water for brewing up to temp in about 6 minutes!  Makes brewing so much more convenient. Update: taking it down to 1 star!  used it twice and now the regulator must be replaced at a cost of $31!  That makes this burner close to $80 overall.  Not only that, but the other burners actually provide a much higher psi regulator.  Debated whether to just pony up for the other burner vs. replace the regulator/hose and decided to go with the replacement, but if I could go back in time, I'd buy a different burner in the first place.  Bummed with this product!	-1
I was hoping this pot was bigger. I guess 8 gal. is not that big. That's the problem with buying without seeing  it. This is not any different from pots I have bought locally. The fill line  on pot is pathetic. They claim it will cook up to 18 lb. Turkey. Bull.	-1
Initially, in June, I reviewed this as a 5-star item and really liked it.  I have now - August 13th- downgraded it to 1 star.  Yes, it's very comfortable, and yes, it's pretty, but that is about as far as I can go...  Because this is a hammock, I assume you are supposed to use it outdoors.... For the first month I took it inside when the weather looked rainy, and then I finally decided to leave it outside 24/7.  Hey, it's supposed to be UV and water-resistant, right??  Notsomuch.  After 3 short months outside... (or maybe closer to 2)  it is completely unusable.  The cotton has frayed and rotted due to the weather (normal sun and rain, I think) and you can't use it at all now, because it would just tear apart.  Other reviewers have mentioned the fading you will see from the sun, but I didn't even care about that; I just wanted something to relax in after work!  Well, turns out, this is not the hammock for that....!!  If you have a nice place like an enclosed porch it would probably be a fine hammock, but be sure you purchase the carabiners to hook it up for safety.  If I had to give any advice it would be not to buy this!!	-1
I expected the stainless steel not to rust. I hand washed the pot with a paper towel and dawn dish soap before the first use and over night let the pot air dry in the garage and by the next day the pot had small rust spots I did not expect stainless steel to rust it must be a low grade of stainless steel	-1
Not large enough - did return with no problems.	-1
Works great but beware they are now shipping these with 5psi regulators. Doesn't bother me since I'm not using the hose and regulator it came with  EDIT 12/30/14:  Well this burner isn't as good as my old one.  I can't get a good flame with either the 5psi or 10psi regulator.  The adjuster doesn't seem to work as well, like the only options are full bore or shut off.  Not sure what Bayou was thinking but they went backwards when they changed this burner.	-1
I ordered this next day air delivered December 1st 2011. It arrived. MISSING THE PROPANE REGULATOR!!! I live in an area where these aren't sold or found. Very upset with this purchase. I needed it for a 80 lbs crawfish boil party the next day. Too late to order in time for next day air again. What the %$!@ do I do now? BAYOU CLASSIC SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!  Just called my friend in Wisconsin to tell him. He referred me to this product. Said a couple of guys in his area bought one in the last month for family seafood boils, canning and beer making. Incoming threads on the burner itself are defective. Sent theirs back to Amazon. The regulator won't screw in. My box was factory sealed with clear tape. I thought it was a previous return to Amazon and someone forgot to put it back in the box. "Bayou Classic" has NO quality control checks. Brought the unit in to my local hardware store (they deal in a lot of Coleman and numerous other grills) to fit a new regulator. Guess what? NO REGULATOR ON EARTH FITS A BAYOU CLASSIC PROPANE STOVE!  I cannot tell you how angry I am. No store carries these. Not Home Depot. Not Lowes. Not Dick's Sporting Goods. Not REI. Not ACE. Not WalMart. Not Target. Not Northern Tool. Not Menards. Not Mall of America. It's all online dealers that REFUSE to ship overnight. I know none of them stock anything listed on their websites. Otherwise they would make the sale for next day air. You can call UPS and FEDEX to do a late pick up. But I was calling at 1:30pm-2:30pm CST.  UPDATE: I didn't want the word out that I didn't have a burner. A friend was going to rig his 20 year old trusty burner with a 100 gal propane tank, but luckily someone stopped by with their CAMP CHEF burner. It worked beautifully. Stay away from aluminum stock pots in cold weather. Aluminum radiates heat away from your boiling point. Takes 25 minutes to boil water with a half full 60 quart aluminum stock pot even with high psi and high btu burners.  If you want to build and run a successful business, learn how to STOCK INVENTORY and ship LATE LATE LATE in the day. I run a small business and we ship up until 7:00PM via UPS and FEDEX hubs. 70% of our sales are last minute buyers after 3:00PM looking to receive their item next day air... even Saturday Delivery. We've saved thousands of people and companies from disaster.  Roll the dice on Bayou Classic CHINESE made products.	-1
The one I received was not well made and poorly packaged. It was out of square and the screws attaching the burner to frame had fallen out in transit. Sent it back to Amazon and purchased a Hurricane burner from Williams Brewing - a much higher quality item (more money as well).	-1
"You get what you pay for". Mine worked fine for a few uses: cleaning the deck, siding and other small jobs. The other day the hose broke in the middle of cleaning siding. I purchased the Powerwasher 80011 Universal replacement hose for $18 but it is not compatible and now I have to return it. The cost for a new hose by Campbell Hausfeld is about $43 + shipping and taxes. A brand new Campbell Hausfeld PW1350 cost $95 and a refurbished $77. I am sure they know the hose is made to be broken after a short time and that's why the over charge for the part.	-1
I bought this unit because, I had bought a model very similar about 10 years ago and it lasted 10 years with use a few times a month.  I owned a landscape company and the last unit I bought then was light enough to clean equipment without damage or removing paint. Yet heavy enough to remove grass and grime. Worked well 10 years.  This Campbell Hausfeld PW1350 is pure garbage, cheap plastic crap. I hate to be so harsh but this not the same company I bought from years ago. I would only run the unit up to 20 minutes every few weeks.  It still looks brand new. But after six months I bought and RV and went to clean it. The sucker stalled and would only run for 5 minutes pulsate and stop. I won't buy another Campbell Hausfeld product as long as I live. It is another example of american quality going downhill.  I know nothing last forever, but six months and maybe 12 uses ? Come on Campbell Hausfeld. This used to be a name I could trust.	-1
I had several of these sprayers by "Power Mister" and loved them. I even bought the for my family as gifts.  They did well, then died one by one, but I figured that's fine ... they lasted a few years, so I ordered two more.  The new ones were made by "DuroBlast" I don't know if this is the same company or not.  But after only a few months first one, then the other started spraying on its own (I just heard this noise and finally tracked it down to the sprayer) ... until it made a big mess and ran out of fluid, would not recharge after that and was useless.  I'm now looking for something similar that will last a few years.	-1
The first spayer had problems, but they replaced it with no hassels. The second one works well if I charge it over night. It's a terrific hand saver when one must do a lot of spaying. I use if for my home & office cleaning business.  If you use it a lot, buy two so you can keep one charging while you use the other.	-1
I received this unit a few days ago, and was suprised to find it is not look anything like the unit in the photo. It is much smaller, and does not allow for attaching the accessories to the unit.  It is basically a small carry unit - much lower-tech looking than the one in the photo.  It also did not have a car kit, or a soaping wand.  The basic unit works fine, and Amazon made some adjustments to keep me happy, but don't order this and expect to receive what is in the photo with all the accesssories.	-1
Shoots out the powder in globs. Plunger tube is too narrow so forced air is too slow and below necessary volume.	-1
crap	-1
What a badly-designed, poorly made piece of useless junk the Chapin duster turned out to be. Yes, if you use it bowl hanging down as shown, all you get are clots and clumps of powder, nothing resembling 'dust.'  But if you flip it, as many reviewers suggest, you get one or two small plumes of dust and then nothing -- because the tube that draws in the dust goes to the bottom, when flipped it goes to the top and pokes out of the dust. (In short, it was designed for the bowl to hang.)  So you have to keep tipping and flipping the dang thing to produce any effective dust. Or I suppose you could cut the tube to a nub, but you'll still have the problem of the plunger handle popping loose every few minutes - it doesn't screw on, it's just held on by 'fit.'	-1
It sure isn't like the metal ones my grandpa had that lasted for years & years.	-1
I borrowed this unit from a friend to spread lime, and found it very disappointing.  There is no agitator in the bin, so it very quickly stopped spreading lime once the initial amount right over the openings was exhausted.  Unless somebody can tell me it is just missing the agitator, I won't even consider getting one of these for myself.	-1
3 Strikes and Your OUT  1. Tipped over and lost 30 lbs of Fertilizer and Burned my lawn. Due to the fact the wheel base is so narrow.  2. Handle that adjust the spread rate snapped on 2nd use.  3. Gears Locked Up, Only one tire spins. The other tire just drags now.  This all happened before the end of the 3rd use on a 1 acre lawn.  I thought about returning it, but after it tipped and ruined my lawn, I brought and the sledgehammer and took care of the "Earthway".  For a $100, this unit is pathetic.	-1
Wow, what a waste of money.  It shoots out a big blob of dust, then the next few pumps don't put out anything - followed by another big blob of dust...  Plus it was shipped in a tiny box so the end of it was all bent up, and had to keep heating and cooling it to get it to point forward.	-1
I am sure with enough time one could develop the appropriate touch to get an even spray with this product.  I simply do not wish to take that time and will use other products.	-1
Doesn't apply powder the way that powder should be applied. First pump gets you a small air-cloud puff of powder, next few pumps - nothing, next pump - a large clump of powder lands on the ground; then it repeats the cycle.	-1
Got this to plant strawberries in, only got about 20 in it. Says max 6ft, only if you have 1 tier. The strawberries grew great with it, but the problem is when you weed around it they just rip out the plant next to it since there is not much room for the roots. Wish I would of got something else to grow my stawberries in.	-1
Cheap piece of garbage. Fell off a 3' high shelf and broke into 7-8 pieces, and I had not even used it yet	-1
After reading all of the instructions, mixing my liquid bug killer according to the instructions, and setting the dial appropriately, I turned on the water and started spraying.  The sprayer emptied the entire contents in less than 4 minutes.  The contents, at that mix and spray rate, should've allowed me to cover 1000 sq. ft. of ground.  I don't think anyone can move fast enough to evenly cover 1000 square feet of grass in less that 4 minutes.  I can only assume I have a defective sprayer, based on all of the other great reviews I read which lead me to buy this product.	-1
I have no idea how to set for miracle grow for one tablespoon per gallon. Don't understand how to set for any product. Sending it back!	-1
Chapin makes the best pump sprayers. I have purchased five in the past ten years, and they are still going strong. . Their hose end sprayer is an exception to Chapin quality. It is cheaply made. As a result, the plastic always break at the joint where the handle meets the container's screw-on top. I have purchased three, and two broke after five uses, always at the joint.	-1
I purchased this with the intent to use it with Ground Clear.  After I had the sprayer and Ground Clear in hand, I found that the sprayer cannot deal with the relatively small amount of dilution required.  I could not use the sprayer for my intended use. If the spayer's range of dilutions is on the Amazon page, I did not see it.  If it is not, it should be added.	-1
I purchased this hose end sprayer and the other one Chapin makes that is for spraying liquid insecticides and weed killers, Both of them are now resting in the local land fill where all cheap Chinese made plastic junk ends up,  First off they leaked and the dial on top of both of them never worked right and the dam drinking straw they provide would fall out at the least little movement rendering them both useless.	-1
I recently bought 2 of these because another website recommended that they worked well for spraying Neptune's Harvest Fish Emulsion Fertilizer at the prescribed rate of 1 Tbsp/gallon.  The emulsion is not thick or lumpy.  This is the type of hose end sprayer that sucks up the diluted material through a plastic straw and mixes it into the stream.  First thing I noticed was that the plastic straws on both of them were about the same size of the hole in the lid into which they were to be inserted.  What that caused was that the straw would chronically fall out of the top, and end up floating in the  bottle.  Second thing I noticed was that neither sprayer (the 2nd one was bought as a "spare") would spray the mixture for very long without becoming clogged.  I set the sprayer to the maximum orifice opening, but still found that the sprayer was unreliable because (1) either the sip tube would fall out of the top, or (2) the sprayer would become clogged.  Frustrating in that one cannot tell when and where in the spraying process the thing stopped dispensing the material.  Since it has been 2 months since they were delivered, Amazon's policy prevents mer from returning them, and I don't have an issue with this.  Once I learned that they "were mine" , I unceremoniously threw them into the garbage - $30 down the drain on junky equipment.  Although one might think that the mixture was "too cloggy" for the sprayers and its therefore not a design problem, the sipping straws that chronically disengage because they're not sized correctly  - there is no excuse for this.  So, even it the opportunity arose to use these sprayers for something that they could handle, I still would have a problem wondering whether the sippers were still in place during my spraying.  ....First time I've seen such a blatantly poorly designed hose end sprayer.	-1
I purchased this sprayer to spray my flowers with Miracle-Gro Bloom booster. I don't like the Miracle-Gro brand hose end sprayer. I wanted to try the "gentle shower" setting on the sprayer. Well I like the gentle shower part. But the jet stream needed to mix the powder fertilizer and the water does not work on the granular side. I have to use the liquid side. Fine, I tried that. But then no fertilizer was coming out of the darn thing. I ended up using the tube. But then the canister emptied very quickly. Good thing I walked fast, I didn't want to kill my flowers with an over concentrated mix. I am pondering if I will bother returning it. UPDATE. I sent a picture to Susan Myers of my sprayer at Chapin . Check the user's pictures. I uploaded it to Amazon. On the picture the dial is set to dry. I asked if the water was coming out of the right hole. I had to do this because she told my the hole was probably clogged the first time I called. I unclogged the hole closer to the edge. But now, on the dry setting, again, the water comes out the other hole closer to the center (see picture, again). Finally she told me the tube was missing from the picture. I replied that the instructions clearly stated to REMOVE THE STUPID TUBE! She insisted I used the tube. Finally she admitted the instructions were wrong. Well, according to her. She also claimed she replied to my e-mail. I never got a reply. That is why I called her back. DON'T BUY THIS THING. IT DOESN'T WORK, THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE CONFUSING AT BEST AND LOOKS LIKE THEY SHOULD BE REWRITTEN. Let's just say she did reply and that I never got it because the internet was broken that day...	-1
Got this 2 pack yesterday 04/24/2018. Today opened one up and installed its black spray nozzle. Shook the oontents up and used it to spray a little on my pants legs, shoes and socks.  Put the bottle aside for about an hour and came back to use it again but the spray nozzle trigger broke and quit spraying! Cheap piece of junk nozzle.  They put a notice in the packaging saying that they ran out of spray nozzles so substituted a replacement nozzle.  I guess they went cheap!  I decided immediately to return this 2 pack to amazon for a refund.  I did not bother to try and open the 2nd bottle to use it because the nozzle will probably break on it too.  The bottles become useless to me if I cannot spray it as intended and I am not about to go searching and looking for a separate spray bottle to transfer the liquids.  Because of the cheap nozzles they switched to, I cannot rate this purchase any higher than the 2 stars I am giving it.	-1
Great good looking product, I used for  interior pest control application,  but it does drips, a lot. I use it  for pest control applications,  after calling the manufacturer,  they told me I need to order the drip less tank.... When in fact it does not mention at all the nozzle drips like a broken pipe... If you are in the pest control industry,  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,  your customers will hate you and fire you...	-1
Stay away from permethrin.  Most parasites are immune to it.  It will just make you and your pets sick.	-1
We liked this product, and it had many good reviews. Unfortunately, it draws fruit flies. This time of year, we have tomatoes. The scraps wind up in the bin. The problem? It doesn't seal well. The lid doesn't sit flat on the bin, and the filter does the same, leaving gaps on all 4 sides. The gaps are large enough for fruit flies to get inside - and breed! We can't keep this thing in the house, as they fly out when you lift the lid. So what is the point of having one, if it's kept on the back deck??? Maybe in the fall, when the flies may be less prevalent, I'd give it a higher rating. But now, in the summer, it is unusable. It was a waste of money, and we are now looking for a replacement. NOT happy! edit << maybe ours just has a warped lid. If the lid was flat, I'd give it 4 stars. If the lid was easier to pop open, with busy, wet hands, I'd give it a 5. You almost need one hand to hold the base down, and one to bend the tab back >> == OK, we've had this thing a while, and I dropped it a star. The bin is useless. A $2 trash bin would be as useful. Fruit flies bread in here. When you open the lid, they fly out. I have to keep it on the back deck, which isn't very convenient! I should have just returned it. (the flies are fewer, as fall comes, and fewer scraps go in) One thing I am going to try is to hang a small cup inside, with water and vinegar. This will draw the flies and reduce their numbers. Stay tuned... == My latest thoughts, after 2 summers - I'd give the bucket 2 stars. It does hold scraps. But for execution, I'd give it a minus 1. This summer, we bought a sealed storage container for inside the house, and transfer the scraps to the green bucket, on the back deck. Then, it will all get transferred to the compost bin in the back yard.	-1
Sprayed on our clothes as directed. Worn them in Brazil. I was eaten alive.	-1
We didn't realize this was extremely toxic to cats so are unable to use it since we have cats and would never use a product that could be harmful in any way to any animals.  Currently don't know what to do with the bottle; perhaps find someone who can use it safely or attempt to return but returns are such an expensive pain in the behind.	-1
Messy to use, liquid came out at the sprayer.  My husband still ended up picking up two ticks while mowing the lawn.	-1
Since it did not come with the spray nozzle, the product is not very useful.	-1
Although this stuff does work really well at repelling ticks , chiggers and such,you should be aware that the spray dispensers on every one of these I have ever bought leaks all over your hand when spraying. The precautions on the bottle CLEARLY says DO NOT SPRAY ON SKIN ,it is poisonous to people. The maker of this stuff should be held accountable for that, this stuff could potentially make you sick or cause other very serious health problems. You will need to at least wear rubber gloves to spray it,which is in my opinion the only safe way to use it.	-1
I bought this to make "tick tubes", and this is the first time I've bought permethrin.  I didn't realize it comes in different concentrations.  This bottle is 99.5% water.  Other brands are 63% water. So drastically different.  But, we'll see how it works.	-1
Gee, don't you think you should include warnings in your product description, such as that permethrin can cause fatal poisoning in cats?	-1
The bug repellent works, but the sprayer is terrible. Impossible to hold/use one handed, and the spray head constantly spins as you spray (risking an accidental spray into your eyes or elsewhere). Do not recommend this one - find another permethrin source.	-1
Product received is not as advertised. It was supposed to be a spray bottle and there is no sprayer. It also did not come in the package shown so I guess that's why there's no sprayer.	-1
I sprayed it on my clothing and let it dry. It worked well the first time. After I washed it I had ticks all over me. Doesn't work as advertised where you're supposed to be able to wash your clothes up to 6 times and it remains viable. Untrue. Most likely they water it down.	-1
Doesn't seem to work. Sprayed all my clothes including my hat and was covered by insects.	-1
Sprayer didn't work! What a mess!	-1
Returned this product. Cannot get on your skin and cannot spray on clothes while you are wearing them. May keep ticks away but not practical to use. Too dangerous	-1
This stuff works, but I refuse to be accepting of the horrible 24oz spray bottle I got. There was a printed card included that said they were having trouble getting the spray bottle shown. Mine came in a white bottle, I'm not sure if it is physically different from the yellow. Its a relatively small spray head for the bottle. No taper or hand gripping area to the bottle, so no easy way to hold and spray. I pretty much have to squeeze between my thumb and index finger which are also supporting the weight of the product. There is just no where to grab this bottle and spray. It's like a big hand lotion or shampoo bottle that they found a spray head for. I'll need to get a different spray bottle to continue using this product. Beyond the  bad ergonomics, this spray head will be a problem as the product gets low. It does not have a rigid dip tube, it has a springy tube that shipped outside the bottle and tightly coiled up so I'm pretty sure its not reaching the bottom of the bottle because it wants to spring back to being rolled up.	-1
useless	-1
Pump sprayer - useless.  Dribbled (all over my hand) more than it sprayed. As Mosquito repellent - initial results don't look promising.  They are all landing above the doorway instead of where I sprayed on the sides of the door.  It appears the "repelling" zone is about 15".  I'll put the rest of the bottle in a normal sprayer so I can spray above the door.  When the contents are finished, I'm going back to deet.  Picked it up locally (REI) so I wouldn't get a leaking bottle.	-1
A waste of money. I'm getting eaten alive as I write this review.	-1
Not worth it. Didn't really see that it worked.	-1
The spray bottle was broken so I couldn't use it before my last trip. In order to use this I will need to transfer this (carefully - the warning label is very strict on not letting this stuff touch your skin) into another spray bottle. I can update this once I actually am able to use the product but I'm disappointed that it wouldn't spray. I tried all nozzle spray settings (off, spray, on, etc.) and nothing worked. I asked 2 friends if they could figure it out and they were also unable to get the spray bottle to work either.	-1
Arrived without a sprayer...	-1
Not sure about the product's effectiveness, but the sprayer is junk. I ordered this for an African trip and got it a couple days before the trip. I tried spraying my clothes, but with every squeeze, at least as much liquid as sprays, pours out the spray head. Essentially, 50% of the liquid is just falling to the ground. It's too late for me to get a replacement or order new, so I'll have to make due. However, in the future I'll look for a product in packaging that actually works.	-1
This product contains permethrin, a US EPA likely human cancer causing chemical AND a European Union listed endocrine (hormone) disruptor.  Use picardin instead.. less toxic.  Unfortunately products that are hazardous and unnecessarily risky like this are legal to market in the U.S. due to unscrupulous and corrupt officials who get campaign fundings from the pesticide industry and those who frequent the revolving door from regulatory agencies and back to the pesticide industry.	-1
So far, not working. Will try a bit longer, and edit if works. Last sentence was a month ago. I sprayed all things on back porch according to directions to keep mosquitos from flying in everytime I opened door. All I can say, is it does not work.	-1
no evidence this works	-1
Didn't receive spray nozzle.  Unable to use without transferring to another container.	-1
garbage, don't buy	-1
Doesn't have any instructions or doesn't tell you you need two of theses if you have three blades or more.	-1
The vendor was top notch and delivered the item quickly as promised. My problem is with the products quality. Do not buy these low quality pieces of junk. Save your hard earned money. The quick disconnects do not make positive connections and blow off when the water is turned on. The metal is low quality and both of the nozzles are broken off the deck from debris being kicked up by the blades. This product should not have ever been released for sale to the public.	-1
Mine came with detective pump.  No matter how I tried it would not spit a drop.	-1
I was unimpressed. It seemed to provide no deterrent for no-see-ems. Mosquitos may have been deterred for the first 10 minutes, then I needed to spray again and again. I am so disappointed. I don't want to soak myself in harmful chemicals but I am a mosquito magnet. I hope I find something better.	-1
I should have taken a picture of all the mosquito  bites I got after spayed this product all over my jacket, pants and hat. Fair enough I was in Canada, in deep woods and it was at dusk, a lot of mosquitoes and they were hungry, I wasn't expect to get no bite but getting so many bites on my arms, legs and face, that just proves this product does NOT work.	-1
This product may work and I believe it does but I cannot press down on the pump enough to apply it.  The design of this package needs a major revision.  It would take two hands holding on and pressing down on the pump.  Since it won't pump when held sideways or upside down either, I can't imagine how one would apply this to one's own self. Needs an army.	-1
Now I know why they discontinue this product........bounce off the table  right into the trash...a waste of money.....	-1
On multiple occasions one of the three strings has flown out of the head. It seems to be the same holder that lets go. One time tje string hit my leg (while wearing long pants) and left a welt that lasted several days.	-1
So So. I live in Alaska and we have a lot of mosquitos. This seems to help some, but you still need to wear bug dope.	-1
Scariest disclaimer and use instructions I have ever read. Didn't use it. Won't use it.	-1
Despite this stuff claiming it's unscented it does indeed have a strong chemical smell.  We sprayed it on mosquito netting and furniture cushions in Bali on vacation and these Balinese mosquitoes just laughed..... there was seriously zero effect.  What worked for us?  Cutters Eucalyptus Mosquito Repellent.... all natural... strong scent... but at least a natural alternative that works.  Of course, with mosquitoes, your mileage may vary.  Sorry, cannot recommend.	-1
This may work very well but it is too toxic for me,  sent it back.	-1
don't buy these kinds of products, because they cannot be returned. also, there is no way of having it replace, because the return page sends you BACK TO SHOPPING!!! It is a good product, only if i could get it out of the can...the nossel and the stem fell off and the product is un- use able!!! buy it from your local home depot, where you can return it. don't buy	-1
As instructed, the day before my 5-day hiking trip, I sprayed all my clothes, socks, hats, shoes and gear with this nasty chemical.  Waited until the next day to pack it up and had bite marks through my pants during the entire trip.  Reading online about Permethrin, the active chemical, I will never buy any product containing this chemical again.  Better off dousing yourself in DEET.	-1
Pros:  Repels ticks and bugs.  Good through multiple washes.  Cons:  I had this on my work clothes while I was cutting wood in 100+ degree heat and sweating profusely and even though it's supposed to bond to the fabric, you do still absorb some of it, and I'll tell ya', it made me feel strange.  In the fall and winter the above would probably be a non-issue.	-1
I use this on my pants,socks, shoes & boots every time I go in the yard {acre} I still get chigger bites.	-1
I have a netted tent like enclosure in my backyard that is to protect me from bugs.  Well I sprayed the whole thing with this spray twice over and the moquitos would just land right on the net, completely ignoring the spray.  Ive tried this several times and it doesnt seem to repel anything.  I sprayed it on my clothes, let them sit for a day, wore them outside and had bugs landing literally right no my shirt and shorts.  Im wondering if I just purchased snake oil here.	-1
Just returned from a two week camping trip in the Smokey Mountains of North Carolina.  I had treated a full compliment of clothing for my wife and me and expected to be well protected from biting insects.  NOT SO!  I was bitten by a toxic spider through my socks and received multiple other bites through my long sleeve tee shirts.  I had followed the instructions for applying Permethrin by getting the clothing very damp, certainly enough to do the job.  We are so disappointed in this product that I am going to package up all the unopened packages (ordered 6) and ship them back to the manufacturer.  I'm not looking for a refund, only desire to make a point.  My advice - don't waste your money.  Buy good spray on repellent.	-1
It's a nice set for a gift but they are not comfortable to use.	-1
This set os pretty good. My only complaint and the reason I returned it was the tongues. They are flimsy and bend as you squeeze them to grab your steaks.  I had a couple of big steaks and I couldn't pick them up.  I had to swivel the tongues so one tongue was right underneath the steak like a spoon and then I was able to pick it up and flip it.	-1
This was not what I expected at ALL> It separates the fire form under the meat area so you don't get that BBQ flavoring from th ebunrt edges.	-1
Quality control is horrible. My smoker box arrived badly scratched. One of the coal grate lifters had two fingers broken off. I ordered two replacements, since I saw how poorly they were made and thought they'd break easily. The two they sent didn't even have the fingers set at the same spacing. Therefore, the coal grate sits crooked at any level. One of the lifters didn't even have the fingers aligned properly on the same piece. The grill isn't any where close to air tight. Without considerable modifications, it is useless as a smoker. Passable as a grill if you remove the smoker box, but barely passable. To do so, you would need to cover the hole where the box mounts. They will sell the part for that. If you go that route, be aware that it won't come with mounting hardware. Neither does the warming rack, which this grill does not come with.  Spend a few more dollars and get a good one. This one is not worth it's value in scrap metal.	-1
We received this as a gift and already it is starting to RUST out in the bottom.  It grills ok but don't count on having this grill for long due to the rust issue.  It is a lot of money to put into a grill to have this happen.  Luckily we didn't pay for it.  Also the "all weather" cover is terrible and has come part, shredding.	-1
This grill is not that hard to assemble and is mid priced for a cheaply made offset smoker. Assembly took me about an hour and that wasn't too bad considering i am fairly inept at following assembly instructions. I used the grill for a fourteen pound brisket for its first time use. The temp gauge is totally useless and i used a remote thermometer for the grill temp before using it for the meat temp. My big problem with this grill is the inefficient heat retention. I was cooking for fourteen hours and used more than twenty pounds of charcoal. The charcoal i use is expensive and the amount i used for this was excessive compared to my big green egg. It may be better for summer grilling but using this in cold weather is difficult to justify when it comes to long time smoking. It has the benefits i desire in an offset smoker but it lacks year round use due to heat loss due to thin metal. I spent about 35 dollars for the charcoal to cook the brisket and it adds too much to the cost of making the food. Otherwise i would add a star to four. There really isn't much out there that is good unless you go to over a thousand dollars unfortunately. This grill appears to be the best of the low range offset smokers but you get what you pay for.  Update: After doing several racks of ribs, I have concluded that cheap offset barrel smokers are not worth putting money into. The key for brisket and ribs is temperature control with precision. This cheap model which is the best of the low range offset smokers is seriously lacking in precise temperature control. By the time you get it stabilized you have to open it up to add charcoal or baste/mop or something else. Then the temp gets messed up and throws the cooking off kilter.  The reason I bought this grill was for brisket and ribs and this is unit is not the answer. Maybe the more expensive ones are better. You can correct temp variation over ten or more hours of cooking so it will not have the impact with the brisket as it does the ribs but you really have to finesse with foil wraps or such and for good barbeque you have to really get a good quality smoker. I wasted my money but you don't have to. I cannot recommend this offset smoker based on a lack of adequate temperature control and maintenance while cooking.	-1
It is sad to say but the days of a solid American made product is dead!  The smokers made by Char Griller boast that they are American made, and covered by a warranty...then in the small print it says 'the paint may peel off your smoker upon first use (it should say WILL peel off upon first use!), the paint is not covered by the warranty.'  if you are unfortunate enough to own one of these then you know what I am talking about, both my grill and side smoker are all but devoid of paint.  I called Char Griller and told them that I was appalled by their underhandedness, they didn't seem to care.  well the best (or worst) advertising is word of mouth.  and I have nothing good to say about this product!	-1
Don't buy this item.  The finish will burn off after 2 uses!  and when you contact char-griller they will tell you that your warranty will not cover their shoddy product!  in the day and age i would think they would be more concerned with keeping customers.	-1
I've had this grill for around a year now.  I didn't have any of the problems I've seen others have with assembly (read the instructions carefully and have a friend handy) or poor construction.  Nice big grilling surface.  The cast iron griddles are fine, though I don't see what the big deal is about them.  You do  have to keep after them to prevent rust.  I think this is because of my big beef about this thing, which follows.  The word "airtight" when used in connection with this grill is an outright lie.  The "airtight" hood is anything but.  This thing leaks air like a sieve.  It goes through fuel like crazy.  It's especially frustrating when you're a cheap so-and-so as I am and you like to save your charcoal between grillings.  My old 90s vintage Weber would snuff charcoal in a couple of minutes.  This thing?  Never.  Whatever you put in will burn to ashes.  And before it does it will get Oh My God hot.  This burns off the protective seasoning on the griddles, so they rust.  I haven't tried to smoke anything with it; I don't trust it enough to hold a steady low temperature.  That's doubly frustrating when you bought it so you could try your hand at smoking.  I've burned enough excess charcoal to have bought another Weber.  I'm grilling with it tonight, and then that's exactly what I'm going to do.  A guy at work wants it; he's welcome to the POS.	-1
From some of the reviews I had my exceptions a little high. I am not exactly sure what I was expecting but I was expecting a little higher quality. It's the little things. The box it came in looked like it was kicked all the way to my house. Alot of the screws didn't line up with the holes. Alot of the welds were sloppy. The wheels are plastic and wobbly. The lid didn't fit on the bottom well as other reviewers pointed out.  I'm sure it cooks well enough. I just didn't get that far. I got half way thru putting it together and found that the barrel was seriously dented and the hinges were bent. So I took it back apart and returned it. I am just going to get one from a local store. Not worth the frustration and sweat to get this thing in proper working condition.	-1

The spray radius is ridiculously weak.	-1
This needs a lot of water pressure to work right, I hooked up a splitter so I can get more coverage with 2 of these and it barely dribbled out. Kind of waste of money for my little experiment	-1
Very disappointed with Dramm, of whose products I have many.  This is less than a year old, used less than once a week, and it now leaks at the valve pretty badly, with water running down the handle onto your hands and clothes, just like cheap ones do. I have Dramm cut-offs that are over a decade old, and I've been able to re-build them to function like new. Not this product. It's aluminum, not brass like Dramm's cut-offs.	-1
At first it worked very well. The lever makes it easy to turn on; you can use it for an hour without your hand getting tired, and it has a loop to hold the lever down in case your hand does get tired. I was very happy with it at first, but now it's shot, and it only lasted about 15 months, and I didn't even use it during the winter.  Its downfall is that they make it out of aluminum, and aluminum corrodes. When aluminum corrodes you get aluminum oxide, and aluminum oxide is used to make sandpaper and emery cloth. It's very abrasive stuff. When it forms inside the valve on this product, first it seizes it up. Then, when you work it loose, it scores the soft brass valve components and makes them leak.  If you want this to last, don't leave it on the hose. Dry it out completely after each use and spray some WD-40 inside. If that's too much work, be prepared to order a new one every spring.	-1
Total junk! Mine failed after only six weeks and there is only a 30 return period. I have bought these before and they used to last a long time but  now they are just cheap junk. Check put the Nelson products.......they seem much more durable.	-1
Owned for ~18 months, light duty used maybe 50 times.  Handle broke at hinge, rendering it useless.  Constant dripping leaks from the pin end -- appears to be bad machine thread tolerances.  When it worked, worked well but the poor quality of this and other DRAMM parts is beginning to make me wonder why I still use them.	-1
it decreases the water flow too much. is hard to lock on, but won't stay locked. a real pain. a	-1
This valve is a plunger with a spring to close the valve after you release the handle. After one season it was stuck down/on. I threw it out. Better to go with the handle style valve, that way you can open or close it even with some mineral build up.	-1
My tomatoes are almost gone.  Appears to be just another deer/rabbit repellent.  I was hoping!	-1
I have spent a great deal of money on this product, wanting to give it a fair chance, but I have been very disappointed! First of all, it is costly. I have used the liquid spray as well as the powder. The 2.2 lb. size powder will only give you 10 qts. or a little over 2 gallons, and if you have a lot of plants and a fairly large yard, you will need more than 10 qts. Also, do not expect to spray just once every 3-4 months as the package will state. During the growing season you must spray much more often. As far as the effectiveness, I sprayed my yard thoroughly and concentrated on one area especially, only to find the area badly damaged by the deer. In this particular situation, I could even smell the solution the next day, so I am sure the deer smelled it! This was the "straw that broke the camel's back" for me. I really had high hopes for this product, but it failed me miserably!	-1
did not work	-1
Impossible to mix.  Imagine goopy blood all over kitchen, with half of it down the sink.  What did get into the sprayer seemed like a deer appetizer.  They goobled up the plants after weeks of repeated spraying.  What a useless product.	-1
beware does not work on anything, even the liquid is a rip off and it is super expensive tried the dry 2wice, and the liquid twice on multiple properites. don't wast your money	-1
Attracts flies smells disgusting. Like mixing pigs blood and after all that, the deer love it. Eat all the treated flowers like chocolates	-1
Would be great if on a 6' roll instead of wrapped up on itself. Makes install a pain in the booty.  Edit: roll is only 60" not 79? Rip off city! Not happy at all.	-1
Not the same as pictured. I bought 2 of these and one of them has the connector to screw into the old style tanks and the other has the new style. Both will work but the new style connector doesn't need a wrench to tighten and the old style does. Tried to exchange it but was told it is not returnable. Should have bought from a local store for the same price.	-1
Not reviewing the quality of the item but more the disclaimer that should have been stated and that is, this is not an extension cord for your grills standard gas line but rather a proprietary gas line adapter/extender for certain coleman stoves	-1
Does the job ... This is my second one in 6 months.  First one started leaking gas at the crimped on fitting. Tank end connector hard to grip to tighten to tank.	-1
Was disappointed as it did not work to hook our grill to the propane on our camper	-1
I used this twice in one week on two different tanks and it causes the tanks to leak. It sucks	-1
Developed a pin hole leak within a month of using.  Not safely repairable so it is landfill now.	-1
Unfortunately this hose did not work so  it was returned.	-1
Arrived on time, clogged.  Returned to Walmart and traded for unclogged one.	-1
On my last camping trip this failed. The internal plastic insert and ball bearing came out cause propane to spray out of the tank. Looking at others on amazon this one clearly has a design flaw.	-1
The hose does not allow the gas to come thru, it is crimped or faulty or something.  Trying to contact seller.	-1
I don't know if is just in California but there is a standard connection on all 5 gal propane tanks.  The connection for the tank will not work on these tanks.	-1
I accidentally bought the wrong hose and the return isn't worth the hassle. FYI this does not connect to a standard 20 pound propane tank.	-1
While the description stated this would work with my Coleman Road Trip grill, it barely allowed enough gas for a small flame.  It appeared the fitting to the 20lb tank was the issue.  Sent it back to Amazon and picked up one at Home Dept that worked perfectly.	-1
Like many others have said, the pressure to the burner was just not sufficient. I threw away the packaging (dumb) otherwise I would have returned this. A lot of reviews led me to try a hose that has a "female" connection to the LP tank, but I tried this (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Stansport-Propane-Appliance-Bulk-5-Feet/dp/B001GSHSLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Stansport Propane Appliance Bulk 5 Feet</a>&nbsp;hose and it leaked at the connection to the tank. SO, now I suppose I'll go on to try a THIRD hose/adapter.	-1
does not work as the description says it does! This leaked badly on my propane tank. I will be sending it back to amazon. I bought another one from home depot and it ended up working fine.	-1
This feeder is not made well, it's not easy to clean and the birds don't like it	-1
They are growing green no blooms at all very disappointed I have no flowers and it's almost time to start getting cold	-1
image from seller shows huge,palm size bulbs with some green growth,what I got was half the size,zero green growth..package stated it was 7 pounds in weight,lucky if it was 3 ounces.....	-1
Many of these bulbs were rotted and never grew.  The two that did grow are stunted and look unlikely to flower.	-1
the metal they use is horrible.  it is already worn out in nothing flat.  there is nothing left to sharpen.  saddd...	-1
The earlier reviews say that this brush holds a lot of 'sauce'.  However, it is advertised as a mopping brush.  In that capacity, it is a major disappointment.  Mopping sauces are very thin and are used to keep meats (ribs, brisket, pork shoulder etc.) from drying out in the cooking process. This brush doesn't absorb enough of the mopping sauce to be effective.  I don't use the cotton mops because they 'drink' most of the sauce...this one is just the opposite.  It doesn't absorb enough 'mop' to baste the food to avoid drying out. It is best used to apply thicker barbeque sauce at the end of a bbq cook.  Silicone just doesn't work with a mopping sauce.	-1
The Oregon 75-021 belt that I received was defective right out of the package.  Normally a belt will be formed into a flat coherent coil before being shoved into the pasteboard jacket.  Mine was kind of twisted and when I took it out of the jacket, it would not lay flat at all, having two 180 degree twists in it. I'd guess it was still hot off the press when shoved into the jacket and took a set with two twists in it as it cooled. I installed it anyway and each time I put the mower deck clutch in the belt came off the idler pulley the next time I engaged the mower.  i re-installed the belt three times before it broke giving me a 79" long snake caught up in the mower pulleys. There may have been excess tension when it tangled, but it looks for all the world like a weak spot that just pulled apart. It could be just a bad sample, but looking at the cross section at the break, it does not look to have as much fiber cord in it as I would have expected and what it had was only along the half inch wide back.  The belt it replaced was 10 years old and was used to mow high grass.  I will return it to Amazon and try another brand.	-1
It figures. If it sounds to goods to be true, it usually is. The belt does not fit. Dont waist your time here.	-1
Edit: What is with the price gouging? The very first one I bought in 2015 directly from the makers site was about $15 The first I bought through them on Amazon the same year was about $20 And now they are about $40 each? With zero change in product quality and in fact possibly lower-quality now? Makes no sense.  Have bought four of these in the past. Love the first couple until the sun simply weakened the plastic too much. The third one I bought cracked at the bottom for no apparent reason, where the plastic wraps around the bottom yellow piece. Super disappointed the same thing happened with the recent fourth purchase, and much sooner than the last. All I do is gently tap the feeder after filling or during the day to ensure finches have seed access when it looks like they dont. Another disappointing factor is that this used to be like 15 bucks and was better quality when it was that price which is weird.	-1
This thing is very long, but there's only one hole per perch, so it doesn't accommodate nearly as many birds as a finch sock.  It's also a horrendous job to clean.  That alone is a deal-breaker.  I bought their seed tray separately, and it was pretty lame, it needs to be wider and much deeper to hold all the fallen seeds.  Also difficult to reattach since there are only about 3 threads on the male end.  It's well-made but not well-designed.   I feel dumb for not realizing how few birds it would actually feed.  It was weirdly sad seeing all the finches politely sitting on their perches eating by themselves, so orderly and quiet and un-bird-like.  When they are on a sock, it's a rowdy party and a lot of fun to watch, and every bird gets a chance to feast.  I returned this and got a refund.	-1
So far I have had no luck with this product.  In addition to that it is really long, so I have it hanging from a tree limb versus my feeder station.	-1
This feeder with nyjer seed was a total failure with the Cassin's finch on my property near Taos,  NM.	-1
will not fit the manufactured deck. blades too long, chute doesn't fit, if you have the tamped deck, maybe, Is not as advertised	-1
I have an older model Craftsman LTX-1000  lawn tractor with a 42 inch deck.  This model was apparently made by Husqvarna.  It already is set up for mulching with a very similar shield.  However parts of the shield are damaged and one of the rubber straps that holds it in place is missing.  I thought that this shield would fit.  It is close -- the old and new shield clearly share most of the same design, but everything is a little off.  The new shield is too high and also does not extend laterally far enough to meet the mower deck.  Therefore, there is a gap about a foot long and an inch wide between the deck and the shield.  I suspect that the mower deck/ shield was redesigned sometime between the time we bought the tractor and the time this was made.  We have jury rigged the new shield in place and it sorta works.  I am not sure if I will continue to use this or go back to the older partially functional unit.  Incidentally,  the box is label "Electrolux" not Husqvarna.  I assume that Electrolux also sells a mower made by Husqvarna?  But the contents of the box are clearly exactly the same as the illustrations at Amazon, so I am sure the wrong part was not shipped in error.   and I thought that this would fit.  It  I bought this mostly for the mulching discharge shield, but also figured I would get an extra set of mulching blades.	-1
This is not a very good product ... it might work to hold up peas as the other reviewer here claims, but for heavier vines very thin plastic is not very strong and cannot be supported well on the edges.  This should really be a non-product.  Get the netting that is made from strong nylon twice ... it is softer for your hands, easier on your eyes, easier for plants to grasp and easier to secure to a framework so that it doesn't break.  1/5 - unsatisfactory.	-1
Small grids make this product unsuitable for my needs, way smaller grids than any other trellis that i have bought	-1
Not sure how this would hold up heavier vegetables. Its very flimsy. I decided to return it and buy cattle panel instead. The cattle panel cost me 20 bucks and is metal. Much better for pumpkins, squash and melons.	-1
very weak in power :(	-1
I bought these flags to mark my in-ground pet fence since we had a new addition.  Within the first two weeks of windy weather I would say 90 of the 100 flags have either torn or come off the post.  The PetSafe brand flags were much thicker and better quality.  I opted for these as they were cheaper.  I now see why....  I would not buy these again and would recommend anyone needing these in an open space where wind can get them to buy something a bit better.  I did buy these in hopes the metal post would hold up better when being bumped by riding mower deck.  The plastic PetSafe ones cracked / snapped off very easily.  I will update my review once I cut grass the first time this spring.  If the flags last that long..........	-1
Completely unworkable on my wheel barrow	-1
I kept the grill outside with the cover on. Cover was riped to shreads after 6 months/ year. I guess I won't buy another cover like this. I don't know what else to cover it with.  EDIT/ UPDATE: Pick up a "Classic Veranda Cart BBQ Cover" for a little more money, put an insulated cup/ mug over the smokestack (minus the handle?)and cover the grill, just going right over the stack piece. Mind has been outdoors for about a year and is holding up great and can see it will be durable enought to go for years (it's a canvas cover with a waterproof lining on the inside). Go look at the reviews for that cover. Sure, it diesn't fit like a glove like this char-griller cover, but the added durability (and eventual savings) are well worth it.	-1
It was a good fit, but didn't last long.  After a few weeks of exposure to the hot Florida sun , it faded to a light gray color.  After a few months, it got a slight tear (probably caught the corner of the wooden shelf).  This is bound to happen as the fabric loses its resilience over time.  The tears multiply and grow.  After about a year, this thing is toast.	-1
The stitching on this is awful.  This cover fits excellent, but the stitching is terrible.  After a few weeks and a few uses the stitches created a hole.  Does it still work, yes but not as good as it should.  stitching is basic in my opinion.	-1
Love the pots and holder but the soil that came with it only filled each pot around 1/3 full and we had to get more soil.	-1
but you can't grow your herbs in this I have tired and tried all winter long to grow herbs in the winter so I can have fresh herbs but nooooooooooooooo nothing grows in these so now I will have to find another use for them perhaps at my desk for PAPERCLIPS AND RUBBER BANDS WHAT A SHAME 1  IT WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY don't let the picture fool you the herbs don't grow this big at all they die before they have a chance and I have a gorgeous garden in the summer time and I grow herbs in pots on the deck so this item sux	-1
I bought this to try out indoor herb gardening and am overall disappointed.  The ceramic set is nice, but very small - while it will fit on a window sill, it won't produce anything that suffices past just a decoration (not much too eat). The soil that came with it was convenient, but I'd rather purchase potting soil separately since it was a mess to make and didn't seem to yield good results. The seeds sprouted, but maybe only 30% of what was planted.  It has been a month (I've attached a photo), but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Instead I will be trying: [...]	-1
This cover fits the grill perfectly.  However, it faded and ripped during the first year of use.  Does anyone know of a good cover that will fit this particular grill?	-1
This cover is a great fit, looks good at the beginning.  But within a year it begins to deteriorate.  I managed to make my cover last 2 years, but only because I didn't have the gumption to search for a replacement cover.  It really is a shame, as I like the grill very much.	-1
An exact fit for two models of Char-Griller. I have the model without the extra smoker.  For this one you can cut off the excess material on the other side of the Velcro.  It fits so exactly it is a little difficult to put on.  But it does look good in place! Added comments after one year of ownership--Just downgraded this item because of two problems-- It turns from black to light grey in one season in the sun. It also becomes very weak and easy to rip at the corners after one season.	-1
I have to get a new one of these every year because they do not last long.  It fits the grill well.	-1
As many others have written, this cover is cheap vinyl and does not hold up well to the elements. It fades within one year and then becomes brittle and tears easily. This is my second #5555 cover, and I have contacted the manufacturer, Char-Griller, and they do no make a canvas cover. With the smoke-stack on this grill, other generic grill covers that have high ratings will not fit my grill. The grill itself is excellent and has held up very well to many years of use and storage outside.	-1
I purchased the canvas cover to go over my chargriller with the attached smoke box.  It fit like a champ.  The problem is that it didn't last a year before there were tears in it due to wind.  The tears mainly appeared around the smoke stack due to the edges on the stack cover.  It also took a sizable tear around the handle, and where the corner of the tray is at.  I wish they would have either put more reinforcement in those areas, or provided a strap to secure it from flapping around so much.  The grill is amazing though.  5 stars for that thing...just keep a can of high heat paint and some sand paper for the smoke box as the paint will peel due to the heat.	-1
Bought the 5555 cover for the 1224 grill in June. By September the sides exposed to the sun had turned from black to light gray. Tears started forming and quickly spread. Basically this cover is now useless to me in only 4 months.  When I e-mailed the company, they would not replace this unless I could provide a receipt. I didn't buy this online, and I don't keep every receipt. Guess they don't value me as a customer, or the bad word of mouth this kind of customer service represents.  On the other hand, I'm very happy with the grill itself. I wonder if I can find a better cover from some other company....	-1
Fits my grill pretty good but if you have the side burner it fits a little too snug, but it works well.  Update, not very good quality, the cover ripped on me after one month of usage.	-1
I received a pair of these ARS 300L which is what I thought I ordered and they are smaller than the pair I have, certainly not made as well as the ones I have and not made as well as the pair I have.  In fact I plan on returning them sometime this coming week.  I grow field production cut flowers and cut 1000 of flowers a week and have worn out the pair that I have and wanted to replace them with what I ordered but will not keep these.	-1
I ordered the hardwood handle pick, but got one with a normal wood handle, with green plastic at the end where the mattock head is actually attached. I'm sure it will still work, but it's a problem when the item you purchase is not the one you receive!	-1
very poor quality, the item is not at all as its described, and the seller doesn't go through amazon for returns so goodluck with that!	-1
Was not at all what I needed. This is more a problem with the product description than anything else. Is probably a great product for the right application.	-1
The handle looks and feel like cheap plastic. The head looks like is casted metal and not forged metal. I cannot find any engraved or stamped info on the tool that states the type of metal it is and if it has been forged, heat treated or tempered. I did find a stamped word that say "India". If you look at this mattock from the top, you will noticed that the blade part of this tool is bent or mis-aligned. I was afraid to use this took to strike something hard, so I returned it. What happened to the better made tools that were "Made In China"?	-1
This thing's OK.  But it's plastic.  Eventually its going to break. My wand snapped above the handle when I was tapping it to try to clear up the spray pattern.  I kept buying cheap to mid-level sprayers like this one, and finally bought a B&G sprayer.  It hurt to pay that much, but it will outlast me. . .	-1
What it is: garden sprayer (pesticide, or herbicide, etc) with a nice metal tank and wand.  The valve, and pump mechanism, however, are plastic.  I've had this sprayer for over a year.  I've used it a lot of times - more than the few poly sprayers it has out-lived, combined.  The tank is galvanized, which means, if you rinse it after use and store it dry, it'll last a long time.  The sprayer easily handles 1.25 gallons of mix (capacity: 2 gal), and the sprayer head works quite well.  The valve mechanism is plastic, and literally broke in half today, I had to unscrew the pump to release pressure while the contents sprayed about.  If it had a metal valve, the sprayer would still be in service.	-1
I always consult the reviews on Amazon.com, and as the reviews were overwhelmingly positive, I ordered the Hudson 96303E Comando 2 Gallon Sprayer.  I've had a number of garden sprayers over the years, usually purchased from Loew's; my last two were plastic RoundUp sprayers.  As I've never had any problems before, I filled the Hudson sprayer with a Spectricide mix.  I pumped and pumped, but all I can hear is escaping air.  Going back to the instruction book, I applied petroleum jelly around the camplate, as well as the top of the pump cylinder; I also checked for leaks where the hose connects to the tank, as well as points along the extension and the control valve.  It still doesn't build pressure at all: all it does is blow bubbles out the top of the camplate/tank.  I sent an email via the Hudson website regarding the problem on 04.15.11.  Until the problem is resolved, the one start rating remains.  I'm very disappointed in the Hudson sprayer, brass extension or not. 04.19.11--The Hudson customer service is as bad as their sprayer: I received a reply to my email stating that "roundup" couldn't be used in the Comando sprayer, that the weed killer chemicals would damage the internal epoxy coating!  Nowhere in the Amazon.com description or the sprayer instructions does it say garden chemicals can't be used.  What good is the Hudson sprayer, or rather, what good would it be if it actually worked?  I've contacted Amazon.com for help. 04.19.11--The mater was resolved through Amazon.com, NOT Hudson Professional Products.	-1
Don't buy this bird feeder! It's junk! Despite having hanged it correctly, it fell... not once, but twice. I think when the bird feeder gets warm from the sun it  expands the plastic and falls from the hook. It's a waste of money.	-1
Broke after a week.  The screw on top is plastic and cannot hold this amount of weight of seed.  I had the item a week and just went to refill it this am and as I lifted it off the plant hanger, the screw came away from the top and crashed down to the ground, some 10 ft off my deck.  Needless to say, it broke.  The design needs to be a metal screw at the top; not plastic.	-1
Save your money and worry.  The cheap PLASTIC hanger assembly does not hold up.  I even only use during daylight hours.  The feeder tubes are to heaver then the plastic screw in assembly that it hangs by.  This is the first 1 star I have had to write about.	-1
Read description carefully, these tanks come empty.  You can go to your local OSH and buy a filled tank for the same price.	-1
This feeder has completely yellowed in less than a year of use.	-1
Lasted five weeks.  A fat squirrel jumped on the baffle, knocked the thing to the ground, cracked it open and bird seed went everywhere.  The baffle is the top, so the squirrels had a party.  Junk.  Expensive junk.	-1
Openings for seeds move easily sideways causing the bird seeds to fall out. Threaded top not secure enough, when full of bird seeds and several birds are on the unit there is a danger of the top and main body separating and dumping all the seeds!	-1
This is supposed to be a UNIVERSAL blade,, The spindle hole is WAY to small to even fit  a Toro 22"  walk behind mower. Missing parts, Doesn't FIT, Crap customer service. This is a purchasing NIGHTMARE.	-1
Just bought one at the local home improvement store for 29 bucks plus tax.  Check your local store and you can buy a new tank and have it filled for about 50 bucks.	-1
Doesn't work on my mowers, the spring doesn't touch the ground, even at the lowest possible settings.	-1
bought for someone	-1
The first squirrel to jump on it and it came crashing to the ground.  A very weak fastening system for supporting 7 pounds of seed and one little squirrel.	-1
A real piece of junk. They give you a hand full of adapters, not one worked on my Snapper mower. If your mower has a couple of dimples to help hold the blade in place, do not get this. It just spins and wears down the dimples. Would not recommend this to anyone I wanted to keep as a friend.	-1
Rips up the lawn	-1
When new, this chain saw is hard to start. Yes, you follow the instructions precisely and it works. But it is still hard to start, compared to the half dozen other saws I have owned. Worse, if you let the saw sit for a few months (which is common for me), then it is so gummed up that it must be dismantled and lubricated before you can start it again. Contrast this to another similar saw I have, which sat for more than a year and started immediately.  That said, the saw works well and has plenty of power. Hard to adjust correctly though, it does not idle very well (even when new). I had to adjust the idle speed high enough that the chain was spinning, to keep it from dying. That problem went away after 6-8 hours of use.  It is an acceptable saw, barely, but I would not purchase it again.	-1
My MAC3200 gave up the ghost after 17 faithful years.  This Poulan brought back all the nightmares from 1994 ... I had had a Poulan before tossing it for the MAC.  Plain and simple ... Poulans do not start or, if you're lucky to get it started after hours of pulling your arm out, it doesn't stay running.  I have no idea why a MAC can start on the second pull every time year-after-year, but these POS can't.  And why McCulloch goes under and Poulan doesn't.  Who makes their small engines anyway?  Call to Poulan [number in instructions] ... => they said, "can't use ethanol-blend gasoline".  I told them "that's all you can get in VA, the 10% ethanol blend".  They say "sorry, you're screwed Charlie".  Since I can't return [one reason for NEVER buying a non-returnable item from AMAZON, I decided to donate to Goodwill and buy the McCulloch at my local Home Depot.]  Unless you can afford a Stihl, go with an electric.	-1
This thing will tip over with anything more than air in it. The wheels are too close together and too small.	-1
We have one of these for hauling yard stuff back and forth on a long uneven lawn, and every time it tips over I curse it for how unstable it is. The designers had the challenge, "how can we make this more unstable than a wheelbarrow?" Their solution was first, use wheels that are too small and second, put them right under the load instead out in front of it.  If you have one of these, it's better to pull rather than push it and it won't tip over as often. But the best scenario is to buy a wheelbarrow instead.	-1
Bought multiple units to use in various areas near each other but they evntually started to read the same sensor. Tried seperating them far apart to fix but it just happens again. Guess you get ehat you pay for.	-1
Inside unit is too small ,stand is poorly designed,all ready broken	-1
not accurate	-1
did not work and was returned	-1
Doesn't ever seen to have the correct temperature. I ended up buying a different one that shows correct temperature. Don't know why it's off up to 5 degrees.	-1
After three months of use the outdoor sensor stopped working, before that went through batteries very fast.  I wanted to get a replacement outdoor sensor but it is discontinued. Will not buy Acurite again.	-1
I had one of these AcuRite units that looked identical 5+ years ago and it worked fine, so I figured I'd give this a try.  I put brand new top-shelf triple-A alkaline batteries in both units, in the correct orientation.  After a few minutes I determined something was wrong because the indoor unit still was not reading the outdoor unit temperature, which was sitting two feet away from it on my desk.  Went to double check that the batteries were inserted correctly and making proper contact and picked up a hot potato - the remote sensor was literally borderline uncomfortable to touch.  Quickly removed the back cover and popped the scalding batteries out (confirming that yes, they had been inserted properly) wondering what just happened.  I tossed the batteries that came out as they had surely spent themselves generating that much heat.  After 15 minutes I put two more batteries from the same new package in and it sync'd up with the indoor unit showing ---- 149*F! ----.  I waited a few minutes to see if that number would fall, any, but it didn't.  Picked up the remote sensor again and it had once again gone in to meltdown mode.  I'm sure this was just a manufacturing defect but it instantly cost me $6 of batteries and now I can only monitor indoor temps.	-1
Had to return this. Outdoor temperature not staying connected to the main thermostat.	-1
I couldn't get the temperature unit to communicate with the gage so no outside temp. After googling my issue. You need to have band new high quality batteries preferably with OVER 3 years of lifespan remaining on the "good thru" date. I tried 2 sets of new batteries with no luck. Seems that this receiver should have been made to use a larger battery. I called their tech line and an automated voice told me that 9 people were ahead of me.  I wasn't waiting for 9 tech issues to be solved. I hung up the phone then returned this purchase. I also found that this unit is no longer manufactured. I'm guessing that this is probably because of the battery issue.	-1
A I-WRONG!  Temps are up to 15 degrees off on the out temp. This my second one. I give up.	-1
Junk...worked 2 months	-1
I bought 2 of these three years ago. They are still working great. They have been out in the weather year round. they are still working great. I bought one, and it would work at all. I returned it and requested a replacement. No problem, I received at new one within one week. It worked for one week, and then the outdoor sensor quit. I took the batteries out and keep the indoor unit. I pulled the RV that had one of the original outdoor sensors on the back. The indoor immediately started receiving the transmission from the old outdoor sensor. I guess the new ones aren't as well made as the original ones. The service from Amazon was good as always.	-1
I just got it in the mail and put fresh batteries in both units. Transmitter and display, set side-by-side for one hour can't agree on what the temperature is!  I understand that there are many complaints here about the battery life of this ACURITE thing . I can't evaluate that yet  will update later  please wait one year :-)	-1
Short range, especially when it is cold outside. Fresh batteries make no difference.	-1
Mine broke are two months, a real piece of junk.	-1
The outside temp does not work. Sometimes (rarely) if the batteries both inside and outside are fresh, it may work for a very brief time but then only a few minutes. You get what you pay for. The inside temp does work but there are many better thermometers if all you care about is inside temperature. I would not recommend this item at all.	-1
The display unit was dead on arrival.  I had read that the unit was unreliable but thought I would take a chance.  Lesson learned - Don't buy anything with the Acu-Rite name.	-1
outdoor sensor never worked for me, right out of the box.  the company hasn't responded to contact requests.  already through this in the trash, don't buy it.  literally buy a nicer product for a few more bucks.	-1
Can not recommend this item.  Compared to other weather stations I have it uses batteries 3 x as fast.  Does not update temps good even tho the sensor is less than 12 ft away. Same brand at Walmart, and was considerably less than the posted price here of over $25.	-1
Although this unit is accurate and convenient, it needs batteries every month or less. Unfortunately, I have several and they are all the same. Buy another brand.	-1
Pros: None  Cons:  1.  Display is very small with poor contrast  2.  Eats batteries!! (Outdoor sending unit batteries need to be changed every 2-3 weeks!)  3.  Weak wireless transmitter (would not go through wall to receiving unit 5 feet away (claims "100 ft range"!), but would go through window to receiving unit 7 feet away.  After giving up on this one I tried a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Taylor-1456-Wireless-Indoor-Outdoor-Thermometer-Large-Readout/dp/B0001U6OYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Taylor 1456  Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Thermometer Large Readout</a>&nbsp;unit bought from Amazon.  Much better!!	-1
I'm in my 4th week of treatments and I can't see to the bottom of my 1500 gallon pond, it is so green. I started with a clean pond, have two baby fish and a few water lettuce. Maybe I am being too impatient, but so far I'm not very happy.	-1
Does not work at all. :(  Get an UV light purifier filter. That is the only thing that works. After wasting money in products like this one I got an UV purifier and my pond is crystal clear and my fish healthy.	-1
LONG STORY SHORT....THE PACKAGING SAYS "IMMEDIATE" RESULTS. THIS PRODUCT DID NOTHING, ZERO, NADA, TO THE PEA-SOUP IN MY POND. ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER,WHEN I CALLED AND COMPLIANED, I WOULD NEED TO BALANCE OUT MY POND FIRST, ADD ALL SORTS OF OTHER PRODUCTS, AND "MAYBE" JUST "MAYBE" IT WOULD WORK IN 6-8 WEEKS. UNFORTUNATELY, IT DOES NOT ATTACK FREE FLOATING ALAGE....BUT THE PACKAGING DOESN'T STATE THAT IT ONLY KILLS CERTAIN TYPES. I REQUESTED A REFUND, AND THEY ARE GIVING ME A HARD TIME.	-1
I bought this product without reading the label completely. The label states that this product is Toxic for Birds. Since birds are splashing around and drinking from our pond all the time, there is no way I could possibly use this product in our pond. I am just waiting for our next Toxic Drop-off Day so that I can safely dispose of this junk. I can't believe they would market this product for use in ponds.	-1
Didn't do anything to the algae	-1
This arrived with a busted container and caustic stuff spilling out.  I have used it a few times and got little if any results.  I will not order this item again.	-1
It was stated that it was safe for animals, plants, fish, etc.  When I got the product and read the fine print I discovered it is toxic to birds.  Why would I use ANY product that is toxic to something live?	-1
I have a 4000 gallon pond as the Alge started to grow, I used it as directed did not do anything not one Alge lifted up ! I'm very disappointed at this product I waisted money !	-1
It killed our fish. Would not recommend. Use Hydrogen peroide instead, and fish have lived a long time.	-1
Product killed some of my string algae (used as directed).  I refilled my pond and two weeks later my water is still foamy.	-1
Talk about a huge waste of $$!!! I live in N Central FL and have a 2500 gallon pond which is pea soup green. I emptied over half the water, refilled with good well water and put in 8 container cups (enough for an 8000 pond) of this stuff... sure I had a bit of dead algae rise to the surface and I used a square bucket to skim get most of that out. Ok, so the directions stated it may take a few days to really notice the change in water clarity - Nope. No difference. So, 5 days later, I went out and broadcast the remainder of the 8 lb bucket of GreenClean and now a week later, still zip! This junk may work great for Northern birdbaths but here in the South it just works to lessen the green in your wallet! Save your money!	-1
Sucks, doesn't work on the side of the birdbath. Must sit directly on algae for a long time UNDISTURBED or it does not work. Would not recommend.	-1
didn't have much impact on the algae in my small pond	-1
I have two garden fountains, one being of 250 gal. capacity and the other smaller one being of 50 gal. ~ I thoroughly cleaned both fountains before using this product at the recommended amount (which is a joke) and have watched them both turn olive-green with algae!  ~ I doubled the measure, still without results and after two weeks put SIX TIMES the recommended measure with the only results being....SLIMY BROWN WATER with 'bubbles' floating on the surface, which I find disgusting!!! I do NOT recommend this expensive product to anyone and will never buy it again in the future!	-1
Doesn't do as good a job as the liquids that I have used.	-1
Waste of money. It kills algae if you put product on the algae, but nothing else.  Algae comes back in a few days . Also tired on my waterfalls and it didn't work.	-1
This product was not what we expected and disappointed us from the start.  The dosing table is not accurate.  We used the amount specified and it did not take care of the algae - we found that using twice as much worked much better but there went the profit margin down the drain .  We are a professional landscape & water garden company and we know the volume of water in every water feature we used this product in.  We will NOT buy this product again.	-1
We have used it as advised and it does not stop any green slime what-so-ever.  Stay away.  Garbage and a waste of money.	-1
Didn't clear up the algae.  I had the floating kind of algae.  It seemed to work when I directly applied it to some algae in a small bucket.  But didn't do the job when I used it in the pond.  The algae came back in a day or so.	-1
I have a 40,000 gallon pond this stuff barely did anythingit might help for 3 or 4 days and that's about it	-1
This is a highly toxic chemical.  I purchased it and it did nothing but kill my fish and plants.  I even used 1/4 of the dose that it instructed.  Now that I have buried over 30 goldfish and lost all of my water lillies, I now have to pay to dispose of this CRAP!	-1
I purchased this product with the hopes of using in my fish pond. I stood to believe that it could be added directly to the pond with the fish still in there but after receiving the product the label states you must first remove the fish, drain the pond, the add product directly to algae to remove it. If I had to do all that, I didn't need the product at all. I could just brush the algae away with a brush and rinse.	-1
Really, really cheap.  Pegs broke off after 1 day.	-1
Lasted literally one summer before the plastic that holds the entire feeder up broke causing the rest of the feeder to shatter when it hit the ground.	-1
I don't normally like to leave negative reviews, but this deserves one.  The very first time I filled this feeder, it fell apart on me.  It's made with such cheap, flimsy plastic that unless you literally have someone standing there holding it together while you pour in the seed, it will fall apart and fall to the ground - seed flying everywhere.	-1
You get what you pay for. This fell apart in a month. The birds hadn't shown interest in this one. I'll spend more for a product of better quality.	-1
Will not buy again.  The squirrels ate through the plastic.	-1
Broke after a month...  >^..6,	-1
Very flimsy. It broke the first day while hanging, then crashed and shattered. I received refund.	-1
I should have known better as the price was so cheap.  So is the product.  It hung in the tree exactly two days, then I found it on the ground with the plastic loop hanger detached.  The loop will not go back in the holes and stay since it appears that the plastic knobs that keep it in the holes is stripped, or not long enough, (or whatever), and therefore I can no longer hang it.	-1
This product is a classic example of "you get what you pay for."  It lasted a couple hours before all plastic perches were broken.	-1
Cracked down side repaired with duck tape..	-1
At first, I enjoyed this feeder until I noticed most of the seeds are dropping below. It attracts little birds & is fun to watch the activity.  I finally noticed they seem to dig a bit when choosing seeds which scatters a large amount onto the ground below.  When I finally noticed, I found a huge pile of fresh, untouched seeds that the other birds had not yet (and never did) found.  What I also don't love about this feeder is how it didn't last very long. I was filling it one day and it just split - it came apart & seed spilled everywhere.  This is not a quality feeder, I would suggest you look at a sturdier brand as I'm going to do.  I am trying another feeder that is different yet will still attract the smaller birds: Perky-Pet 312 Panorama Bird Feeder, Small	-1
Lasted two months before the loop tore off and the entire side of the plastic tube split open.  I have a similar tube-type feeder that cost a lot more but has been going strong for over five years. Not worth the cheap price for this.	-1
This is a good inexpensive feeder. The perch design allows for birds to be in a much more comfortable position. It also has a screw-on cap which is nice since I have had a different feeder empty completely when it blew out of a tree. My only concern was with the plastic hang mount, but I have had it outside exposed to the weather and high winds for a while now and it is still holding up.  2/17/2016 Update: I dropped this feeder from 5 to 2 stars because the plastic hang mount broke off causing the feeder to shatter on my patio. Don't waste your money.	-1
Too small, I gifted it.	-1
I know you get what you pay for, but this is about as heavy weight as a 2 liter pop bottle. Cracked it just trying to snap it together!	-1
No strong enough	-1
didn't like, picture made it look larger...... to small and didn't seem very strong.	-1
doesn't hold small seeds, haven't had any birds find it...	-1
Birds are not using.	-1
Swirls love to eat the plastic no more for me thank you very much	-1
Two stars only because it is just about worn out after less than six months. The squirrels quickly ate off some of the foot rests, so the birds can't use those holes. It the round plastic cylinder is beginning to  give way at the seam. The lid does screw on and the squirrels did not ever take it off, but it also sticks shut and is hard on my old hands trying to open it. However, we will eventually replace it with another similar type of feeder but made of a better quality materials, because the small birds really do love it.	-1
It has been six weeks and the birds do not come to this feeder.	-1
very very cheap. pretty much 2 halves of plastic stuck together in the shape of bird feeder	-1
Cheaply made. Didn't even last the summer.	-1
It's cheap plastic, all of it. It does NOT unscrew from the base as stated in the description, only the top. The hang mount flops over making it hard to put up. However I did save the metal top and hanger from my broken Aspects feeder, redrilled a " hole where the cheap plastic hanger is attached and attached the metal Aspects top, hanger and crossbar. It actually works just fine now.	-1
Not sure how (squirrel?), but the perches were on the ground, the changeable feeding portals were chewed through and seed was everywhere. I threw it away. It is really cheap plastic.	-1
ugly and waaaaaaaaay overpriced; you can find it at a DECENT price (under $5.00) at Home Depot/ I don't recommend it!	-1
Birds don't like this feeder and have never used it to feed from despite my moving it to various locations in my attempt to get them to feed from it. Useless!	-1
don't waste your money on this, pay for a more sturdy one.  The side of container split at seams and parts are cheap plastic	-1
This feeder is very cheaply made. The plastic pieces fell out the first week and couldn't be replaced or glued. It arrived split along a seam. the lid fails to screw on tightly allowing the feeder to fall on a regular basis. I wouldn't buy it again. Investing in a better quality feeder is highly recommended, particularly one with a botton tray to catch the feed before it hits the ground.	-1
Really disappointed 2 arrived broken & sent them back. The feeders are very cheaply made & could tell someone else had it as it had been put together. :>(	-1
DID NOT KNOW ONE COULD BE SO CHEAP. THE BIRDS JUST LOOK AT IT AND SHAKE THEIR HEADS. IT'S EMBARRASSING.	-1
Kindly send me the screw on cap seen in this picture. This item was tossed into the box, un sealed and missing the cap. The 6 plastic perches were tossed around inside with the plastic filling. Someone must have grabbed me junk from the back of a shelf and figured I didn't need a cap. I want one asap	-1
Bird feeder arrived in pieces and broken.  The quality was very low.  I returned it and bought a feeder at my local hardware store instead.	-1
I purchased two of these with the hopes of feeding a few of the neighborhood birds. I knew instantly this was a mistake, but thought I would give it a try. One lasted only a few days at best. A larger bird actually knocked off the plastic holder that keeps the food in and it all poured straight to the ground. Entertaining to watch and the birds all thought it was great to eat the seed off the ground.  The second one lasted a little longer - a few months perhaps, but again, the same thing happened. Food everywhere and a useless feeder.  I am back again to find myself two new feeders for this year and thought it would be wise to advise all of you of my experience.  Sorry to have to give it a one star, but I can't find a reason to even go for two.	-1
been feeding birds for over 40 yearrs...this is the worst feeder i have ever had  !!!  it will not hang even horizontally....... had to replace the wire and crimp  it in exact middle  and even then the birds don't like it.... i have five other gazebo feeders made by  cedar works  that i have had for 6-8 years  that hold the same amount of seeds .  and i have to fill those every day.........this perky pet deal  i fill every 4 days or so....but i cannot find the cedar work ones anymore...they still still make them but not with the good screw on tops..  also had to use a screwdriver to pry open the filler cap...so i removed the cap and sanded the edges to get a proper fit ...	-1
Actually I don't hate it, THE BIRDS HATE IT...it seems this feeder pad is SO narrow there really is no place for them to perch...NOT as pictured, so maybe we got the new and unimproved model...only the tiniest of birds will attempt a landing and feeding...In the photo-ad it looked like the an older barn feeder I had...wrong...save your money on this unless you're attempting to draw in miniature species...and actually, even the Chickadees and Sparrows aren't comfortable trying to land and feed...the squirrels love it:  they immediately discerned how to open the loading lid and helped themselves...I suppose the laughter from watching that might offset the twelve bucks I paid for this junk...save your money and keep looking...I'm pretty disgusted that the myriad photos in the ad for this junk are not of the product I received.	-1
Mine came with wire not hooked correctly on one side, returning it to Amazon.	-1
Feeder tips to one side on windy days and the birds can't perch.	-1
This item is made for a square pole the pole I have is round.  I had to return it.  I didn't see anything in the item description that would have saved me the cost and effort of return.	-1
stopped working after 18 months.... Expected more considering the price.	-1
Bought this in August of 2013 and quit working in June 2014. With it not being used during the winter I only got 5 months of working time before it died. Would not recommend.	-1
I have had this pump for 1 year and it has jamed twice this season. I have it in a filter bag and it still jams. Also there is a constant hum. Loud enough to he heard through the walls of my basement. The volume of water moved is enough to run my filter and waterfall however I have not been pleased, My last pump was a beckett that lasted several years and was very quiet. There is a new design for this pump and it may have made mprovements but  my gut feeling is to get a another brand. I have had a Koi for 20 years and the little giant pump does not make the grade. Do yourself a favor and buy something else.	-1
I've had this pump on a shelf for years waiting to upgrade a smaller pump.  Have a smaller version (Model Number PMO-650) of this pump for a pond.  The design does not allow for filtering the water going into the pump.  In a pond setting, this pretty much makes the pump useless as ponds have debris which will easily kill this damn pump.  The documentation included in the package was virtually non-existent in terms of using it in a pond and virtually no documentation on maintaining it as well.  So basically, unless someone can explain how to filter the water flowing into the pump it's worthless in my mind.  The mix and match situation with pumps, filters, tubing, and fountains drives people away from being more popular.  Sell me one package which marries a pump, fountain, and filter for various sized ponds and they would sell better.	-1
I really liked this pump. The main thing I liked about it was the plastic screen at the bottom that kept debris out of the impeller. I placed it inside a stiff plastic coated wire mesh bag. That helped keep a lot of debris out of the pump impeller. I was using it in my fish pond.  Ultimately it was not the impeller that failed but the plastic parts inside the impeller shaft. It's too bad that this pump failed because I was really happy with it. I had been replacing pumps more often than this and those other pumps made by Little Giant cost a lot more money. Update: I contacted customer support. They were not helpful at all. They said try to fix the broken impeller shaft yourself. They have very poor support. I am extremely disappointed with this company. The photos show the very small piece of cheap plastic around the impeller shaft that tore up. Customer support refused to send the parts or help in any way.	-1
This company has very poor customer service, in fact down right rude!!, you will not get to speak with someone who builds or designed the pumps, only the secretary and she is extremely unprofessional who either speaks English as a third language or did poorly in school. The below is the reply that I received. I am sorry you're not understanding what I'm saying.  Our parts for the pumps are manufactured specifically for our pumps, not intex or anyone else.  There is no one else that will answer your question any better than I have.  You will need to google intex and call that company.  I have worked here for almost 12 years, I  know what I'm talking about. The item you're looking for needs to go through the name brand.  We don't do comparative parts for any other company. This will be the last time I explain this to you and your confusion.

This company has joined Little Giant pumps by outsourcing. This pump was Made in China.  I have saved my receipt in a safe place as I am sure the pump will not last for the duration of the 1 yr warranty. I have 3 USA made smaller ones that have been chugging away for 10 yrs.  The later Chinese additions from other companies to my pond are long gone to the city trash heap.	-1
Cheap wood product.  Not easily assembled, especially when instructing a child. Instruction poorly written.  Not good for outside.	-1
For the price, I wished that I had bought a Perky Pet 50301 Wren birdhouse. Both are approximately the same price. The Perky Pet birdhouse was assembled, built of quality cedar, three times the size, and had a flip top for easy cleaning. The Build a Birdhouse is a toy and meant to be treated accordingly - don't think that this is a serious birdhouse.	-1
Nice as a kid activity maybe but very small and low build quality bird house overall. The wood cracks very easily and if not painted I doubt it will last more than a couple of years in any weather. The glue they provide is not very effective, I used stronger glue that was not included here. Also, they chain looks like it won't hold for long. It could be a nice painting and building activity with kids, but not much of a usable bird house once it's done unless it's used for decorative purposes maybe.	-1
Very poor product, does not stay together, would never purchase again	-1

Too small for birds.	-1
A good "project" for Grand Dad and Grand Kids, but painting where and when is a challenge and it isn't realistically a good choice for the actual birst who may try to use it.	-1
TOo much work.	-1
I bought this bird house as a project for my husband and 4 year old granddaughter to do together.  Things started out ok, but half of the nails were missing.  Luckily, my husband is a carpenter and found some nails they could use.  Our granddaughter enjoyed painting the birdhouse but got some of the paint on her shirt, and although I sprayed with a pre-wash, stain remover and then washed the shirt, the paint did not come out. We paint all the time with children's paint and I've never had a problem getting the paint off any of her clothing. Other than ruining a shirt, it was a pretty good design.	-1
Sucks, do not buy!	-1
I am giving it one star because first of all the bird house is not bad but. The package says it is suppose to come with hooks and it did not come with hooks so to me that is false advertisement. I should not have to go buy hooks when it says it comes with it. Just a note to people that buy this plane on having to go buy hooks for this.	-1
My grandson and I put it together.  He learned a lot - but not what was intended.  The words "Made in China" translate into the word "Junk"  All of the pre-drilled nail holes were too big and so the nails literally fell out after taping them into place.  I had to replace all of the nails with wood screws.  The assembly instructions were convoluted and wrong and and therefore worthless. The holes in the roof for the chain will allow rain to enter easily and drown the little baby birds.	-1
I bought this bird house for my 4 year old. None of the parts fits in the predrilled. holes, so I use a nail gun, to make it fit. the hole for the bird is so small that no bird will ever fit in it. I gave her the paints that came with the kit to her to play withand bought a premade bird house.	-1
The pump was my "go to" pump - used it on my various filters - my prep external filter in the Spring to get the pond ready for the season, then later as the waterfall pump. Used it for October, put it away for the Winter, then pulled it out again for the next year.  So I used it for three weeks, stored it (indoors, after cleaning it) - then used it for March, April, May and June. It died in the middle of July.  I took it to a local pump repair business - the starting capacitor was blown, and would cost more to replace than the pump was worth.  I've stuck with other pumps since then, usually a Tetra with a 2 year warranty. Had one of those go bad after two seasons - but in warranty - and it was replaced by the manufacturer.	-1
Our backyard pond is home to a few water-polluting Koi.  In order to keep the water healthy for the fish, we have two separate pumps. One is located inside the skimmer box and pumps water to a mechanical/biological waterfall.  The second one is located on the bottom of the pond and pumps water through a UV Sterilizer and then through an above-ground biological filter before emptying back into pond.  Our purchase of this Danner 3000GPH pump is as a replacement for our skimmer pump (a Laguna model that suddenly stopped working after 7 years of dependable service).  Since that Laguna model has now been discontinued, we searched for another reasonably priced pump that would fit into the smaller confines of the back section of our skimmer box. The Danner Waterfall Pump is specifically intended for this purpose and is very economical.  We assumed the GPH (gallon per hour) rating was consistent among pump manufacturers and so we initially ordered the 2000GPH Danner pump in order to match the pumping strength and water flow of our previous model.  For those people who are just beginning to get into pond set-up, you do have to make some calculations/considerations for the necessary GPH if you have a waterfall.  If the pump has to move water to a considerably higher area or through a longer length of buried hosing...then you need to increase the GPH.  BUT, if the water rushes too quickly through the mechanics of the waterfall, the bacteria in the biological filter doesn't have time to do its thing. Our previous 2000GPH pump was just perfect.  It gave a nice, splashing amount of water coming from the waterfall...but didn't rush water through the filter too fast.  The GPH didn't begin to compare though.  While the new Danner model was easy to set up, the amount of water coming from waterfall was only a bit more than a trickle.  Really lackluster.  So we returned the GPH2000 for the GPH3000.  Works great now.  The water is now pumping at the rate of our old GPH2000 model. We've only had experience with Laguna pumps so are not really sure if this is just an issue specific to the manufacturer of the Danner pumps or if the GPH can vary that much by manufacturer.  If two different units are advertised as pumping 2000 gallons per hour; logic would say that the water flow should at least be similar, right?  A mystery.  Anyway, the new pump is working great so far.  I would have given a 5 rating for the ease of set-up and the good value of this pump...if not for the issue with the incorrect flow rate.  I'll update this review if the pump turns out to be unreliable.  UPDATE (February 2, 2013):  Well, less than 6 months later...and the pump is dead.  Our initial rating was 4 stars because of how well it worked; but feel now that it doesn't deserve more than 1 star with the durability/longevity problem.	-1
Put it in pond on July 25, 2016, it stopped working on Oct 10, 2016. I would have to say it failed the longevity test.	-1
This pump definitely pumped water just fine.  The problem I had with it, was I don't feel I was truly seeing 3000 gpm.  I bought this to replace my old 3000 gpm pump that had failed.  When I hooked it up, the flow on my waterfall was not nearly what it was before my original pump failed.  It was more of a trickle rather than a sheet flow with the original pump.  I returned it and replaced with a Danner 4800 gpm (due to the price) and now I'm getting the flow that I expected.  I hope you found this review to be helpful, please click below to indicate that you did.  Thanks	-1

Working well, no issues.  Includes anti-backflow valve which limits the flow a bit but not much.  We put our pump in a screened bag before submerging it to try to keep leaves/debris/small critters out of the pump.  UPDATE: it has stopped working and is now blowing the circuit breaker after about a year of semi-constant use during the warmer months.  Will pull it out of the pond to see if it's dead.	-1
Had this hot tub less than a year, stored it last summer and put it back up a few days ago  NOTHING BUT problems I would not buy this unit again	-1
Had it one year and it stopped heating. Costumer service is nonexistant.	-1
I have 3 of the Styrofoam sides in my attic to hold junk. The rest of the spa went to the dump. Took great care of spa but left with empty pockets. Electric bill went up 100 bucks. However, we did enjoy it for 7 months. Going to put on my big boy pants and buy a real one $$$	-1
I chose to purchase this Spa brand new because I live in the city and wanted something to help with my shoulder pain. Assembly was easy and I could set it up myself in a matter of a few minutes. The first time I got in after 2 days of heating the water I felt like I was sitting in an inner tube with holes poked on the side of it. The blower is loud and I could feel it blowing cold air down my back. The side panels are like an inch of styrofoam glued together.  The spa met its demise 7 months after it was purchased. Out of nowhere the Power Pack gave out. I called Oceantis and was told that I needed to buy a new Power Pack or send my old one back, pay shipping both ways and pay for the repair. The repair would of been $90 just for someone to look at it. The cost for a new power pack was $450 not including shipping. I opted to not do anything because I didn't want to send this company anymore money. I lost a little more then $1,000 on the spa and all of its accessories.  After doing alot of research I realized that this happens to pretty much everyone and that this is just a crappy product.  The thing broke about 4 years ago and its still sitting under a tarp at my friends house in her backyard. If someone wants it they can grab it for free!	-1
I purchased this online from a different vendor. My wife loved it and told me over and over that it was the best gift ever.  While it lasted it was great. And that brings me to the problem. After about 18 months the heater quit working. I followed their maintenance instructions to a "t" so the issue had nothing to do with an error on my part. The company wanted to charge me $90 just to take a look at the broken heater - which I would have to ship back at my expense. Then they would sell me a refurbished heater for about $400 which would only have a 30 day warranty. Check all the reviews. It works great for awhile, but this item is NOT made to last and the company knows it. So for a cheap, short term product it's great, but you almost have to consider this a disposable hot tub. We enjoyed the heck out of it while it lasted.	-1
Purchased this product and had problems right out the box and had to have several replacements sent with no success in keeping this working at all..5 power packs so far and it still does not work. This motor is not strong enough to cope with what its expected to do. Water does not go above 96 in cooler weather and takes a full week to get to that temp and the blower blows cold air into tub so the tub gets cold really fast. After blowing up the tub liner it distributes the air uneven and all on the one side which distorts the tub a lot and was told this is a fault they see often...not kidding! The worst customer service you could imagine and customer complaints are all over the Internet regarding this company. After replacing your part they will then demand an $89.00 fee to ship out another part. Check with the BBB and see a list of complaints regarding this company and their product. Save your money on this until they decide to bring out a larger more powerful motor this will not last a season. Great idea if it worked but I wasted $800 not to mention laying a concrete foundation to place this on and all my chemicals to use it. Funny thing I keep noticing are complaints filed on websites selling this item end up miraculously disappearing so wonder if this one will remain here and if I could give this no stars I would.	-1
This is the third bag I have ordered of the Lyric Chickadee mix and it is the worst.  It seems to have been baked too long if that is what the manufacturer does.  It smells and looks burned. I can't buy this brand locally and as a rule I have been very happy with Lyric seeds but this makes me hesitate to order any more.	-1
The light for these things is extremely weak.  They do not work as well as the round ones.	-1
Doesn't stay together; the sticky board always separates from the plastic frame, sticks to the rug etc; surely there's a better form of this trap type? I do like that it uses and LED rather than incandescent bulb.	-1
didn't work	-1
Terrible. DIDN'T WORK AT ALL. Bug waste of my money. do not buy this product. Blah blah blah blah bah	-1
My fourth Beckett W3500 pond pump has now failed.  The first two pumps failed shortly after the two year warranty expired.  The third pump failed at the 23 month mark and was replaced under warranty.  My fourth Beckett pump has failed prematurely.  This pump is the warranty replacement pump.  It failed 13 months into service.  It is my understanding from talking with your customer service that I have no recourse for this failure.  Every pump has failed from what I assume is a bearing seizure.  I can barely turn the impeller with my hand.  There is clearly a problem with the design of these pumps that has not been addressed in many years.  It should be no surprise that I am very disappointed in the quality of this product.  I've been through 4 pumps in 6 years at a cost of over $500.  I'm done with Beckett products.  Details: 1,500 gallon freshwater pond Six vertical foot waterfall Location: Apex, NC 100 gallon free flowing biological filter on outlet side.	-1
I was very disappointed with this product.  When I walk outside I noticed our pond was not working.  When I examined the unit I noticed the plastic flanges that hold the plastic grate over the impeller were broken.  Since the plastic grate could not be secured it place the pump could not build pressure to pump water.  I did manage to fix it with some large zip ties.  It has been working this way for about 4 months.	-1
Purchased  March  13 of 2012 received about a week later. Arrived with one of the "legs" broken . I contacted the seller and was told they would replace  it . I waited  a couple of weeks and contacted them again and never heard back.  Since the broken part  would  not effect the operation of the pump  and I really needed to get  a pump going in the pond for my koi I kept it and installed it. In September 2012 I noticed  the pump was not operating properly so I turned everything off and pulled it out of the pond.  I removed the bottom and found the  plastic impeller was broken as were  two of the 4 pieces of plastic that hold the bottom on .  Now this pump did nothing but sit in the pond filtering water so i have come to the  conclusion that there was  either more damage than was visible when it arrived or the plastic is really  lousy quality!  I have never ever seen anything like this, there is no reason this pump should have basically fallen apart inside . I will never buy another Beckett pump nor will I recommend one.	-1
I used this pump to pump water from my pond to my plants, it worked well for the first two weeks then it froze up and stopped working, returned it to Amazon for a replacement. If the replacement does the same thing then I will send it back for refund.	-1
but, it finally killed the area after applying way room than I thought I would need. We shall see it weeds come back in the spring.	-1
This stuff is waaaaay overprices for the amount of area it covers, plus within 4 months i had weeds again.  Im stickin to the liquid stuff	-1
For the price I was expecting good results.  I applied the correct rate/amount to the area I wanted treated and it did nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Will try liquid now	-1
Need to use a lot and tends to lose its effectiveness after rain. I wouldnt repurchase, but would try the other variety to see if it works better. I have heard great things about this brand and appreciate its ability to be used around pets, but it didn't prevent or fix our slug and snail problem.	-1
I don't think this worked. I put it out multiple times and still found slugs on my plants.	-1
After using this on my strawberries and being sick for 2 days...I knew that something wasn't right. So, I started digging into research about the toxicity of Sluggo.  And there is a lot of conflicting info out there. I'm a Master Gardner (which does not make me a toxicologist) but I have attempted to look only at valid University and Science based websites and articles.  I also consulted some soil scientists that I work with. This is my conclusion. The active ingredient in this product is Iron Phosphate (FePO4).  Iron Phosphate by itself is a benign chemical wouldn't do much to a slug. So, turns out that Sluggo, not legally obligated to list inert ingredients.  And one of ingredients is EDTA (Ferric Acid). When Iron Phosphate and Ferric Acid are combined, you then have a toxic substance. Unfortunately, this combined substance is also toxic to humans, your pets, to earth worms, birds, etc.... So why does it state that it's "pet safe"? Please use your best judgment when applying this product and take caution as you find necessary	-1
Didn't work	-1
Used the whole bottle...didn't work at all for keeping the cottontails off the lawn or out of the flowerbeds.	-1
The spray pump malfunctioned on first use, Fortunately I ordered two and used the second one to spray my tomato plants. What do I do when the second bottle sprayer goes bad?	-1
slugs love this stufft.  hey don't die they just eati t.  I feel like I'm feeding them.	-1
Not impressed.	-1
Got rid of slugs. But now the pellets are moldy and spreading mold onto the plants. Got rid of one problem only to end up with an even more threatening problem. Not good for rainy areas.	-1
Bought it for the squirrel; did Nothing!	-1
I am a loyal Deer Off users for years. Unfortunately this packaging, while a great idea, doesn't work. Either no pressure or Deer Off exploding under the sides of the sprayer attachment. Thought I would save myself some hassle and not mix concentrate this time. After several frustrating attempts to spray, I managed to get this open and dump the product in my own sprayer, which negates the reason for buying it in this form.	-1
The Havahart DO48RTU Deer Off solution might work - I don't know for certain yet.  Hopefully it will since I got it all over myself and everything but the targets.  The Pump Sprayer had leaked inside the box, was leaking and is defective - failing to dispense the liquid as it should causing the spray to decant along the side of the nozzle and out at various angles and off to the side --- any direction except forward, actually.  Still, the solution might be effective at keeping the squirrels at bay so will have to see how that goes.  As for the quality of the "Pump Sprayer" and the condition of it upon receipt that was unacceptable.	-1
Lovely food for slugs is what the label should read. Since the end of March I have been taken care of a piece of lawn 100 ft x 100 ft. I spent at least $1,200.00 buying seeds and soil and finally had a decent green lawn until I saw a yellow patch and one slug. Then I bought sluggo and lo and behold there's no more grass. The slugs ate it all sluggo and all.	-1
We have a number of papaya trees growing on our property and in one location the slugs and snails were continually eating the leaves of two young trees. I purchased this product with the hopes of eradicating them. It didn't phase them, unfortunately. A fail for me.	-1
Didn't work for me	-1
Stinks so bad I did not use.	-1
Be careful. This is not the natural mosquito beater spray I was expecting. Can be dangerous for pets and people both.	-1
did not work	-1
First time I attached it to the hose, the side were you turn it on blow out, and I had Mosquito beater everywhere but on the lawn. Including all over myself. Not real happy with this product.	-1
I used this around some cabbage plants. I previously had slugs that were eating the cabbage but this product was only marginally effective.	-1
Wow, I am mystified as to why no one has mentioned how the sprayer clogs up.  Yes this stuff works great to keep deer from eating anything you want to protect.  However I have bought several bottles thinking I would get a better bottle, but it isn't the bottle at all.  It is the fact that the egg that is in this mixture globs up and it dries in the sprayer rendering it useless.  I tried everything to keep the bottle from clogging up.  I even transfered the spray into a brand new purchased spray bottle.  It worked just for a minute and clogged.  I ended up pouring the stuff in a bowl and flicking it on with a brush.  Yes I was determined to get some on my plants because the deer here wipe me out.  Ultimately, I found a different brand called Liquid Fence  Deer & Rabbit Repellent.  Yeah!  It does the job and doesn't clog up.	-1
I don't like the smell but would have been fine with it had it kept squirrels away from my bird feeder. We used plenty the first day and they stayed away for a few hours..then came back and no matter where we sprayed they would come back.  We used the whole 32 ounces in a few days and still have the squirrels...Its a waste of money.	-1
Might work for deer, but it did nothing to stop the rabbits from using my flowers as a salad bar.	-1
Followed directions to a tee.  Did nothing.  Squirrels almost seem attracted to it.  Deers clearly could sense it, but didn't phase them in the least.  Boo.	-1
These have openings at the bottom and will not last. Water gets in and destroys the inards. Very poor design. Expensive to just throw away. I had one that lasted all of 2 mos. sorry. Try again	-1
Quit before the batteries quit.... that is pretty bad.	-1
Followed directions, and within a day had rabbits and squirrels in the areas I sprayed, won't waste my money on this again	-1
I bought it for the flowers that were eaten by rabbits and it was the third time this spring I re-planted these marygold flowers. I got the repellent and the bottle had broken nozzle. Not sure that made it less effective due to leaking. I needed it in a hurry so I used it by pouring into my own spray bottle.  It did not work. The rabbits ate all the leaves.	-1
only worked for a year and then stopped....not flooded, new batteries did not help.  I bought two unfortunately.....no refunds...	-1
We bought several. Had them all placed in a small space. The product did not work. Don't waste your time and money. The only way to get rid of moles is to kill them, not my favorite thing to do but it's the only way.	-1
I have problem with moles for a month. I tried everything and the last resort was trying this product. I spent about $17 + 3 type C batteries (cost another couple dollars) but worth nothing. I put it in and next day I saw tunnels all around it. I thought moles were joking and dancing around it :(c  Don't waste your money.	-1
Got a dozen of these and a couple solar powered ones from a different manufacturer.  They make different sounds but the results are the same, gophers aren't bothered by them at all and may actually be attracted to them.  I have had them in almost a year.  I believe that because it is the same sound over and over the gophers become accustomed to it.  I put a couple of pictures above so you can see for yourself.	-1
I bought 2 of these based on the good reviews I read and also on the fact that my dad (who lives in south-central Oklahoma) said they work for him.  I gave them a chance based on some of the things said about the moles being attracted to them at first (the box warns you about this), and I have to rate these as a dud for where I live.  I've had them for several weeks (I'd say over 8 weeks) and the moles LOVE them!!!  In fact, I've had increased activity where I've installed them.  I'm really disappointed as I thought this was the answer to my mole problem.  One positive thing:  the batteries are still going strong.  I'm going to give mine to my dad. :-(	-1
I purchased this product after reading all the glowing reviews but after 3 treatments over a 2 month period we've still got lots of snails in our gardens.	-1
I am sitting here watching a squirrel have a ball munching it empty.	-1
I went to Home Depot and found similar product, and 5 pounds of it, for $10.70 .  I tried to cancel this product under 24 hours from purchase and they refused!! Do not but this if you have a Home Depot near You!!  You are getting ripped off.	-1
This feeder is indeed pretty, I like the fact that the roof attached back on easily once the feeder is filled.  My wish was that I could adjust the feeder such that the bigger birds, especially the grackles, would not be able to eat from it.  The adjustment was not at all sensitive so I have returned it.	-1
The birds don't seem to like the color. Regardless of the type of seed we put in it, water collects in the tray and turns it into a multi goopy mess. Weve even added some wee polls to get rid of the moisture, but it doesnt matter. The design is just not very good.	-1
sent back, it was broke	-1
Our fleas must be super fleas, because nothing outside of Borack acid will kill them.  I did follow the directions, but within five days the fleas were back with re-enforcements.	-1
It is really cute, but the birds do not like it. It is definitely not the seed because we have lots of feeders and use the same feed for all the small birds. It is a very good quality seed for small birds. I have not seen a bird on the feeder at all in 4 1/2 months. The other feeders - nearby - are covered up. that is why we needed another feeder. I think they prefer to be able to get into the feeder, not sit on the edge. Our others are more open.	-1
While this stuff seems to kill what it touches, it doesn't solve the problem.  It didn't kill the mound... it just moved it.  The ants that survive below the surface just move down the line a little and make a new, bigger mound.  It also smells strong and terrible.  Hate it and will never use again.	-1
Despite the advertising that claims this stuff is safe, there is recent evidence that this stuff is poisonous to dogs and perhaps children.  It certainly does kill slugs, but there have been recent reports of deaths and less tragic poisonings in dogs.  Iron phosphate is a naturally occurring substance.  However, the inert ingredient included in Iron Phosphate baits is wheat gluten.  As you can guess that makes this stuff very tasty for dogs.  What the label doesn't tell you is that the other active ingredient is the chemical EDTA.  EDTA is an agent that allows the iron phosphate to become poisonous to slugs and anything else that eats it.  Most of the poisonous deaths have come from spills or from dogs accessing this stuff in bags.  But since the advertising tells us its safe for pets and children, gardeners do not treat this stuff as the poison that it is.  If you are going to use this stuff store it carefully in areas where children and pets can't access it.  Don't put it in piles or allow children or pets access to treated areas.  Read the article at hostalibrary.org, in the Reading Room.  What makes me angry about this product is the advertising that claims it is safe, thus gardeners store it and use it without proper caution.  If you have curious dogs, as I do, the only safe slug killing method is 10-15% ammonia and water sprayed all over your garden.  Be forewarned about Iron Phosphate baits.	-1
Really doesn't work well.  Looks nice, but the seed gets wet and then it won't drain the water, so the seed gets mildewed and goes bad.	-1
I don't have anything against the pellet type of Sluggo--it doesn't have Spinosad or Imidacloprid.  I've been using the pellets and have heard from others that they work well.  This particular product (the spray, which is made by the same company) has Spinosad, which is harmful for bees. If you haven't heard, the bee populations have been having a lot of trouble recently.  There have been mass die offs of entire colonies and fruit farmers have started having to get their own bees.  I thought anyone attracted to this product is probably interested in helping the bees and might not know about the harmful effects of Spinosad or  Imidacloprid.	-1
Essentially, did nothing more than move each of the colonies a few feet away from where they were. After six months, I still have many colonies on the property.	-1
Super cute design. Unfortunately it did not protect the seed when it rained. I've had many bird feeders and this is the most  disappointing.  I wasn't able to keep it up long enough to see if it was  squirrel resistant because I couldn't afford to have the seed getting wet every day.	-1
I ordered this to feed birds not squirrels. Unfortunately the squirrels loved it. I do not want squirrels by my home as they do considerable damage. This was a waste of money.	-1
I have struggled with it for an hour and I still can't get this s.o.b. open.  Unless the woman has the paws of a friggin' bear, she will never be able to open this.  It should be an embarrassment to ORTHO that they design their products for a man's hands.  I am a pretty strong woman but I can't get this open.  And a jar opener won't work because of the useless lip atop the lid.  I am SO angry.	-1
Sturdy but the birds seem to shy away and go for the plastic feeders?!	-1
It's cute but no birds will come and feed.	-1
The reason for the one star rating is that it is OVER PRICED !!!!  Paid $9.97 for the same 12 oz container at Lowe's yesterday.  I have paid less than that at the end of the season when it goes on clearance.	-1
Purchased this unit because of a number of squirrel's that attack my other 3 bird feeders.  Thought it would work, but just took a couple of pictures of the squirrel eating at the bird feeder.  Set the spring, but it does not seem to work well.  Even sprayed PAM on the roof hoping the squirrel would slip off, they just hold onto the weather vane, and eat what ever they want.  Not very happy,  unit looks nice, but is NOT squirrel proof by any means. To bad it is a nice unit, but they are still eating up whatever they want.  Maybe if they did not have the weather vane,  they would not have anything to hold onto,  but that holds on the top to the feeder,  cannot eliminate it.	-1
The pearch is way too small , only little finches can eat from it had it for over a month now and thinking of just tossing it out	-1
Yea that's right, they climb on top and after enough fiddling they pop the lid off, because it doesn't fasten very securely.  Also the hanger on mine is not even so it sort of tilts a bit.  The feeder looks nice but doesn't get the job done.	-1
Stopped squirrels for a few days, until they figured out how to beat the system by grabbing the hang bar with their rear paws and hanging down over the overhang to dig the food out of the holes with their front paws, all without touching the perch. In the few days it took them to figure it out, they scratched and chewed the corners of the birdhouse, exposing the metal underneath, which will now rust.  I'm going to try another bird feeder.	-1
The opening for the seed is too small to let a sunflower seed out. Seems fine for millet. Spring is also too strong. It does not close with a small squirrel.	-1
The photo is misleading.  Everything is metal EXCEPT the seed tray!  The most important part.  I was very disappointed.	-1
Were it not for the cheap plastic bottom tray and perch area, I'd rate this 5 stars.  The panels are etched plastic and the rest of the feeder is metal.  Why they would put a cheap, plastic bottom on this otherwise nice feeder is beyond me.  This is the area that will cause the feeder to fail.  The "perch" area is very thin and flexes when touched.  This does not bode well for when the temperatures drop below freezing and the perches become stiff and rigid.  The attractive panels are more than adequate to keep seed in the feeder and won't be pushed out by pressure or weight of the seed.  Were the bottom metal, like the rest of the feeder, I would purchase more, as it will hold a nice amount of seed.  But, once the "perching" area breaks, and the thin plastic perches will break, it's intended use will be limited.  If I've misjudged this feeder, I will up date this review.	-1
I bought this at Lowes.  It's attractive for a good price, but the main selling point is the locking mechanism beneath the roof which broke the first summer I had it.  Metal broke clean off, and looks to be made of substandard material or maybe just a low quality job of welding.  Also the birds don't seem to like this feeder much unless there are no other feeders available.  I've tried both handing it on a pole and having it sit flat on a rock.  They don't visit it.  Since the lock no longer works, the deer come up and flip the 'roof' right off it  with their little noses and help themselves to the nice box full of birdseed.  Same with squirrels.  Great feeder for the less appreciated forms of wildlife.  Not so good for birds.	-1
What a piece of junk. In the trash on day one.	-1
This bird feeder is a nice looking and very well built feeder. Only problem is that the birds don't come very often. When they do come, there is only one or two birds and they leave quickly. It had great reviews, but does not work for me.	-1
Lid won't stay in place.	-1
If I could give the manufacturing of this feeder zero stars ... I WOULD!!!  Don't waste your time to order... I've ordered TWO this week and BOTH came with damaged cords so you can't OPEN/CLOSE the top of the feeder which makes it useless.  Too bad... it's a beautiful feeder but needs to be redesigned to eliminate this cord issue.	-1
The seed mildews inside. I have just thrown the feeder away. There is a plastic cord that runs through the base and through  the top of the feeded that allows moisture inside and causes mold/mildew to form all along the cord and contaminate all of the seed. I saw no point in cleaning it, as it will be a continual problem.	-1
metal is too soft. it bent easy	-1
Pretty but about as squirrel proof as a paper bag.  I've even tried bungie cords to help the roof stay on.  Doesn't work.	-1
The thickness of the shovel head is almost paper thin, it dented on the first very light use. Upside, the shovel head is RAZOR sharp so you could probably cut cheese with it or maybe decapitate a zombie if need be.	-1
Took a squirrel just two days to figure out how to get the screwed on lid off. I had to wrap thick wire around the weathervane portion to the tree to help keep the little guy from turning it. Might want to change the name to "Squirrel Be There" rather than gone.  Otherwise, nice looking.  A longer roof is needed to help protect it from the elements.	-1
Not squirrel proof.	-1
Looks great, strong and durable. Still waiting for winter to come so I can try this out. Very lightweight. More reviews coming up after I try this when it snows! Edit: Horrible!!!!! We finally got snow, I used it once, it got damaged, just like that! It wasn't even heavy snow. So disappointed. :( I got pictures but I don't knw how to upload it...	-1
This seems like a great design, but for a reason I haven't figured out, NO BIRDS COME anymore!  I've always had cardinals and numerous other birds eat the black sunflower seeds, but they are not coming.  If anyone can figure out why, PLEASE let me know what I could do	-1
I have 8 birds and they need a lot of food, so I bought this one. There is a major flaw in the design of this product unless the birds eat all the seeds and throw away the hulls new seeds doesn't fall down.	-1
Very surprised when this feeder arrived that one of the plastic perches was broken!  Cheap plastic, very poorly designed and not a good purchase at all!	-1
How much engineering genius does it take to screw up a simple bird feeder?  Its flimsy and rattles.  The glass panels do not fit tight into the sides and they are very loose.  The lid attaches to the top by having a cable contraption pass through it, and you slide the top down tight.  But when you hang it by that same cable, the lid flops around no matter how tight you adjust the cable.  Worthless and cheap!	-1
The rain trickles down the cord... directly onto your seed... making it clump together and mold.  The seed in the outter tray gets soaked and sticks together.  I previously wrote an outstanding review of this feeder... but since my birds can not feed on molded or stuck-together seed, I must revise my opinion.  Would NOT purchased this feeder.	-1
Hi folks. I don't have spare time to review every product I buy here with over 250 orders in the last year. However, I do feel obligated to mention or warn others when a product fails under normal ordinary conditions.  This bird feeder looks very nice, it holds plenty of bird seed, and I have no problems with the funky lid or filling the feeder. (I don't like the flimsy plastic glass)  I wondered "WHY are the birds completely ignoring this feeder when I clearly see it's still half full of seed? They used to like it. What's the deal?" Hummm.  I quickly discovered the problem. What happens is; every time it rains, the bottom area (tray) gets filled with water and saturates the seed, turning it into a thick muddy paste. At this point, the birds have no interest. After examining the feeder, I noticed the "tray" has little tiny drain holes - not quite the size of lead in a pencil. These drain holes are obviously insufficient. I doubt I can drill the plastic holes larger without breaking the tray.  In summary, I find it surprising that no other reviewers mentioned this problem. Ultimately, my recommendation is to only buy this feeder if you hang it in a dry area, such as in a pavilion, under an eave, or a similar location. For me, it's time to go bird feeder shopping once more.  Be well, Jeff	-1
The squirrels climb on top and managed to twist the top enough for the lid to fall off.  I put two clamps on the front to keep the lid on.  Now they just hang off and nibble.  It's winter though so they are motivated. took feeder down! Water in seed, birds not interested.	-1
I am saying this because in my shipment there were no instructions..just a bag with 4 screws and it looked to be a simple project but for the life of me I just could not figure out how to get it to work.  I did send it back Sorry	-1
Filled it with sun flower seeds...we have a lot of cardinals here; and it has been up for a month and I've seen one cardinal on it and he ate one seed...the slot is too small for the birds to grasp the seed with their small beaks...I have another squirrel be gone feature that has larger openings and they like that better...it looks good and it's made well...but they don't like it...I will alter the openings and see if that works...	-1
I bought this and the Homestead Super Stop-A-Squirrel feeder for my parents for Christmas as the squirrels were eating much of the feed and I wasn't sure which was a better product.  I'm surprised at all the good reviews.  This shouldn't be complicated...it's a bird feeder.  Biggest problem - birds won't go near it.  My parents have 3 other feeders including the Homestead feeder mentioned above.  The birds flock to the other feeders but won't go near this one.  All are located on poles within about a 7 foot radius.  It's definitely squirrel proof.  The squirrels won't even go near this thing.  It's not a factor of the tension spring - they just won't go near it?!  During this cold, snowy winter I would think that if the birds were afraid of it they'd get over it and feed from the thing.  But routinely the other feeders get emptied out and this one is full.  We've tried switching around the feeder positions and even taking it across their yard and hanging from a tree but it didn't help.  Now - the odd "bird closure" mechanism on top broke.  The latch for the locking mechanism under the roof part fell off.  Only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of the durability and large seed capacity.  We've had some significant wind around the beginning of this year.  One day when gusts were reaching 50+ mph this bird feeder was knocked down from a considerable height.  It survived very well even considering the rocks below it.  But it really doesn't make a difference if birds won't use it.	-1
I ordered and setup both this bird feeder and a Brome 1024 on separate arms but they were next to each other.  After a few days, the birds were fighting each other to get shelled sunflower seeds from the Brome but few were interested in the Perky-Pet.  After a couple of weeks and about three refills for the Brome, I took down the Perky-Pet to check it out.  The tension on the anti-squirrel lock was good but the seeds on the edge where the birds get them had become wet and waere all stuck together.  I cleaned it out and after another couple of weeks I took it down again.  The same problem but now water had apparently permeated past the "weathervane" roof locking tab and all the seeds around that post were coagulated together and getting moldy.  This is with just normal periodic showers.  The Brome never got wet (inside).  Other than that, the unit is good, solid construction and the squirrels can't get into it.  Raccoons can however.  I woke up one morning to find it hanging from one side of the hanger.  The seeds were gone but it wasn't damaged.	-1
The Perky-Pet 338 Squirrel Be Gone II Country House is cute.  But it's flimsier than it looks from the photos. The construction is thin sheet metal, with sharp edges.  I don't know why there are so many positive reviews. It's a less effective feeder than cheaper options (i.e., the birds don't like it -- at least our birds in the midatlantic), and my squirrels have been able to get out the seed. Meanwhile, the seed has a tendency to get stuck with the awkward portals and under the levers.  The feeder can be hung from the metal hanger (which is shown in the photos), or it has a large shaft through the middle, so you can stick it on a pole.  The weathervane also serves as the latch to open the top, but it's also poorly engineered.	-1
This "feeder" is a great looking garden ornament, but, a dysfunctional bird feeder. While it thwarts all squirrel attempts to pillage it also plugs and jams so the birds as well are left starving at the gate. Not recommended.	-1
I put this as directed and I have not seen any grass.  It has been months. I am a Ph. D.  live in Malibu.	-1
I should have read all the reviews here before getting a big bag version of this product from the local store of a national hardware brand... They helped me by selling this product, I did it by following the instructions and now 3 weeks later, nothing. If I paid a dollar for every blade of grass I got out of my 27lb bag, then I should have gotten this product for free. That's right, nothing came out. The product is just a messy clump of shredded newspapers and phone books - the smell of ink from the printed paper overpowers any chemical enhancements (err... "nutrients") they added to the mix - if any. I had a bad feeling about this when, upon closer inspection when laying it down I failed to notice the grass seed - and now 3 weeks later of daily waterings I know for a fact that there is nothing of value in this product. On top of that it looks really nasty on my lawn, so now I have to go through the unpleasant exercise of trying to scrape it off and throw it out. Avoid this product like the plague. Or, as another reviewer suggested, take half the money, but the smallest bag of grass seed available; take the other half in dollar bills and shred it; mix the two and you have a vastly superior product for the same price.	-1
2012 was predicted to be especially bad for ticks and mosquitoes, so I purchased this to be proactive and spare my 4 dogs and little girl from a parasitic attack.  While its hard to know exactly how many bugs it killed off, I ended up picking a few ticks off my legs a few weeks after spreading the pellets and my daughter gets eaten alive every time she is out in the backyard (despite citronella torches as well).  The benefit did not outweigh the risk and detriment of laying down chemicals on my yard.	-1
This product did nothing from what we could see.  You'd be better off ordering Sevin.	-1
I've got an ant infestation in my lawn and putting this stuff down doesn't seem to have gotten rid of them.	-1
After carefully following the instructions on the package and also reading other's reviews I added this to my grass since I had been having quite the insect problem.  Sadly within 4 days all my grass turned brown and all the insects are still there so I can't recommend this product - at least not where I live and with the sort of grass I have.  What a shame - all my lovely green grass is now brown and dead and I have no idea if it will come back.	-1
Purchased this to see if it would kill sugar ants and I think it made them worse.	-1
Coated my lawn with this stuff after we were attacked by mosquitoes every night and our dog started coming inside with ticks - we have noticed NO improvement at all! We also had tiny ants coming in until I got some good, old borax traps.	-1
I have more ticks in my yard this year than ever before, so I don't think this works on them, and that is the main reason I got it. I followed instructions meticulously, measured my lawn to be sure I was using correct amount, timed the application so weather conditions were perfect.	-1
Easier to get the spray form. I applied this about 3 times and it did just about nothing and ended up buying the spray that hooks up the hose.	-1
Im not sure what to say. We followed the directions and it has been 2  weeks and not one sprout. We are in Montana and maybe that is a factor. No sprouts, nada. The one good thing which is rather unimportant when is hasn't sprouted is you can tell where it has been cast because of the blue color. If we get some sprouts, I'll revise this review.	-1
Once the squirrels figure out how to defeat this baffler they do like sitting on the flat top and go about eating the food for the birds.	-1
Arrived dented	-1
They crumble while trying to pound them in,  even when the ground is wet.  The plastic cap breaks before I get them all in the ground.	-1
Very difficult to adjust spread and distance. Instructions came stuck together.	-1
After reading the reviews, I had high hopes. After using the product, there is exactly zero difference from not using anything at all. Had my fruit trees for a few years, so wanted to increase output a bit, or make it grow out more. These did nothing.	-1
I like the distance and spray pattern. One of the four doesn't work however.	-1
No where near the coverage advertised and yes my water pressure is great I trashed them	-1
A good thing about this sprinkler is that it produces very little backsplash compared a few other models I tried. The bad things: -- a ridiculously weak and flexible spike, they all break and they do so fast and easy -- the material seems to cause corrosion of the brass hose couplings. Is it made of aluminum? or perhaps some other material with the same properties? I believe these have the potential to damage your hoses in a long run! Does Rain Bird expect me to unscrew the sprinklers every day or what?  For the price on Amazon it's a non-go, in my opinion. On the manufacturer's website [...] it's way cheaper but still a bad deal considering the problems.	-1
I was quite disappointed in these sprinklers. I love Rain Bird sprinklers, but there were a couple of problems with these particular sprinkles. Several of them leaked from the head of the sprinkler causing a puddle of water underneath them. The instructions are not that clear. They should explain which screw on top does what, and in what direction they should be turned to adjust. I had to figure this out on my own, only to find out that in the process they were leaking from the heads. Going to send back and buy them from the local hardware store.	-1
haven't noticed any difference in the tree	-1
This is my second one of these. The first is a year old and still working great. This however was used for exactly one hour every 6 hours for 20 days and then it broke. (I know the exact usage because i bought it for watering my grass see, and I was following the directions.) It now will freeze up pointing in one spot and not move in it's arc. It's like one of the plastic gears got stripped. Totally worthless now unless I find a need to water a 3 inch wide strip 12 feet long over and over again...not likely.	-1
1 malfunctioned upon initial install.  Water runs from the rotation screw hole.  1 stopped rotating after the second use.  It rotates about 20 degrees and stops.  The other 2 function as advertised.	-1
Didnt realize these were for full grown citrus, and had to be two feet away from the tree. lLOL my citrus tree is in a pot, so that was a waste! Please put more comprehensive indications in your description!	-1
I returned mine, it would stop at one spot and just spray forever at that one spot until I nudged it a bit, then it would oscillate back and forth for a few minutes and eventually stop at a different spot. I returned mine for a refund - it just had a cheap quality feel and did not work for me.	-1
Needs much better directions! Considering there are virtually none. Had to go to a garden site on the internet. Better off buying loose fertilizer from Miracle-Gro.  I used these for a month and nothing. Pulled them put loose miracle-gro in and a week later my kumquat trees were going crazy.	-1
They leak a lot after shut off.	-1
The price for theproducts w are good but have lousy instruction.	-1
Bought this based on the great reviews.  Seller shipped quickly.  However, we used this 2 years in a row.  Both years, immediately after applying to our 2-story tall blood orange and 7-foot tall reed avocado trees, tons of leaves turned yellow and fell off.  Our poor young avocado tree has no leaves left now.  Both years we didn't not change other variables such as amount of water.  We ended up digging the spikes out within 1 month of using them.  In the past, we used Miracle Gro citrus spikes and both frees were fine.  Other people don't seem to have this problem.  I'd appreciate if someone has tips to share.  Thanks.	-1

I bought this fencing at a box store and installed it around part of my property to keep out deer.  Deer have never come through the fencing and have not tried jumping it, so while it holds up it does work (at least in my yard).  At first I attached it to 3/4 inch metal pipes (electrical conduit) driven into the ground but this wasn't stable enough.  So I bit the bullet and put in 4x4 posts set in cement and attached the fencing to these.  This setup worked well for two years but the mesh fencing is now randomly disintegrating in numerous places, apparently from UV exposure.  Patching this fencing is an exercise in frustration, really not worth the trouble.  The fencing requires wire to support it; I bought  wire&nbsp;&nbsp;from Amazon, but this still allows the fence to sag after awhile and needs to be re-tightened.  It's an added necessary expense and another maintenance chore.  I've now replaced most of the mesh fencing with the welded wire fence I should have gotten in the first place, material that is pretty much permanent, maintenance free, needs no support wire, and is not prone to sagging.	-1
We need fencing that has some sturdiness/form to use as a barrier.  This is just like the netting we use to cover our blueberries.  It's going right back.	-1
Never found anything to use them for.	-1
Don't buy this to keep deer out.  They ate right through this.  I was hoping that this would work as the price was reasonable.  Save your money if you are hoping this will protect crops, trees etc.  It won't.  I just went out to check on trees planted this fall and the fence has several holes from the deer.  My newly planted trees were eaten too.	-1
The sprinkler leaked from the head.  The spike is VERY weak and bent the first time I pushed into the ground  The spike is NOT strong enough to keep the head in place. The water pressure pushed the head/spike around with each rotation. Unlike the P5RLSP Plastic Impact Sprinkler On Hose-End Spike, the spike is not designed properly (I am ordering a P5RLSP for my next option).  The sprinkler head did shoot out a nice, even spray per RainBird's excellent reputation, but this combination (head on a weak spike) does not work.	-1
The design is pretty much standard, as far as post drivers go but if you are considering a purchase you would do well to note the shorter 23" pipe length (many other drivers are 36" long) which corresponds to a shorter max stroke (meaning a lot more pounding might be necessary).  However my real gripe with this one is the Inside Diameter that is stated to be 2-7/8".  For my particular needs I required at least a 2-3/4" diameter or larger, so this driver should have worked.  But it didn't!  The true inside diameter is a little less than 2-3/4" which is then made worse by the shape not being fully round, but instead being a bit flatten on the welded side.  So the largest diameter I could find was just short of 2-3/4" and in places it was reduced to less than 2-3/8".  So beware! if the inside diameter is important for your purposes.	-1
lousy mess of a product,	-1
