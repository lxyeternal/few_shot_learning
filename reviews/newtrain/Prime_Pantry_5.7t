Good chips	1
Good nice cruch Best chips	1
Yummy! Best word to describe these awesome chips. The sea salt and cracked pepper is very natural, not artificial like other brands, and still has a bit of a kick from the pepper. Not for those who don't like a spicier chip, but delicious for those who do! The kettle cooked style makes them extra crispy and not oily or greasy. A great accompaniment to any sandwich, burger, or hot dog. Perfect for those summer BBQs and picnics. Buy a bag or two for your next party and see how fast they disappear.	1
Lay's makes great chips! This was the first time I tried this flavor-and, like all their chips I've tried-I loved them!	1
If I do buy chips they are kettle cooked and these salt and pepper are awesome.  My boys love them too.	1
My favorite chip ever!	1
great chips i could personally use a little less black pepper but i ate them all...lol	1
These are my crack I tell you! They are not to salty and not to peppery, but just right! I cant even keep them in the house without devouring them in short ordrer. I was pleasantly surprised to find them on here so inexpensive (the same price as sale prices at my local grocer). This might have been an impulse purchase :)	1
delicious and great with sandwiches. crunchy, salty and peppery	1
These are delicious and extra crispy.  We love them and will buy them again.	1
Favorite chips. Can't keep themy in my pantry for more than a day or two. Everyone eats themy and loves them.	1
Tastes good.	1
These are great! Love the salt and pepper taste and the texture of the chips! I am definitely a kettle chip convert now.	1
Not a bad tasting bar. It has a VERY strong dark chocolate taste with a hint of pomegranate.	1
Yuck, too rich for me and the wife didn't care for them either.	-1
A lot of Flavors delivered Simultaneously.	1
Tastes great and gives you energy to continue.	1
Dry chocolate flavor. Not as good as I hoped.	-1
great product as listed with fast shipping!	1
I'm not a big fan of chocolate unless it's bitter and dark, but the chocolaty flavor wasn't overpowering in these and I really love pomegranates so I actually enjoyed it.  They're good for a little pick-me-up in the middle of the day and at least they have fruit in them instead of just sugary junk.	1
taste like water down chocolate mike	-1
This actually tasted pretty good.  I wasn't sure what to expect since it has vegetable juice in it, but I like it.  The only thing I don't like is the added sugar.  Please stop adding sugar to everything!!	1
While the chocolate flavor is ok, it has an underlying funky vitamin/preservative flavor so many of the protein drinks have.  I was hoping for something much better from the folks from V8!	-1
Did not like taste.	-1
Very good.  I use on cereal or as coffee creamer.	1
Best we"ve found so far. Not sicky sweet like most brands. First time I've tried chocolate. was  good. Been using three years, will have to increase as my Parkinsons advances, or someone will have to make drinks.	1
Expensive, but so good!	1
These were actually really good! Everyone who saw me drinking them thought they'd be gross, but they were a great quick breakfast. I mixed it with coffee in water bottle after cycling to work. Really smooth taste and kept me going till lunch :)	1
Way less "chalky" than a lot of these shakes, and since it's a little bigger than most it's more filling. They did make my stomach upset once (probably because of the dairy, to which I'm sensitive), but it seemed to help if I had a glass of water simultaneously.	1
The best tasting protein drink on the market.	1
Husband loves these. Quick for out the door in the morning.	1
Great item and shipping.	1
Excellent product and price	1
Very tasty, but not worth the price. What's up with the bomb proof packaging?	1
Chalky tasting	-1
Very chalky taste. Beware of drinking it on the go you'll need to chew gum after. I didn't like it, but I hate waste food. So I added it to fruit smoothies. Vanilla Nutriment or French Vanilla Special K tastes better.	-1
A little too watery for me	-1
so far so good.  I switched to Clump and Seal and I really like it.  easy to scoop and the cats take to it well	1
This is the best cat litter.  Hands down.  I hate cat litter dust and have dealt with it for years not realizing there were better products.  Then I tried several but this is by far the best.  Dont use the light-weight stuff as it is super strong scented but this kind is not.  It keeps the cat smell to a minimum.	1
Great litter - clumps VERY strong, absorbs odor VERY well (when my kitties decide to cover that is!) and is very easy to scoop. Priced right and lower than most brands, this is my newest fav litter. No strong odor to drive away the kitties and surprisingly low dust. Also doesn't seem to track as much as other litters. Can't figure out why, but it doesn't.	1
I'm a huge fan of this product, and very happy with the price I found on Amazon. Very happy with my purchase.	1
No dust....  It is easy to clean ....  The no dust is the best..	1
Excellent clumping and odor control. Only negative, its a little dusty. Box is convenient to use.	1
Only litter I use anymore	1
Second fav to Tidy Cats brand.  This can be a tad dusty when not carefully poured.	1
No odor protection at all. It turns into goo, it doesnt clump.	-1
It seriously does stop the smells.	1
This is the only brand of litter that I buy.  It clumps well, really absorbs odors, and doesn't glue itself to the bottom and sides of the litterbox.  Very low dust and loose pieces are easy to sweep up when the cats track them onto the floor.	1
This litter is easy to clean but I thought I was ordering the SLIDE and got this one. My cat likes it and I do too.	-1
We have a lot of cats. This litter keeps the odor down and is easy to scoop. We plan to keep buying more and more of it.	1
I have bought this litter several times.  It does mask the odor somewhat and does clump very well.  All that said I gave it only two stars because,  it isn't any where near trackless.  As a matter of fact it tracks every where but I didn't notice it right away.  So why not?  Because it's basically just scented sand.  So the sand scatters and collects down into the carpeting.  I vacuum two to three times a week for cat hair and use a bagged vacuum so I didn't see it in the canister.   I noticed it was sandy when I swept up near the litter box and again, well that happens with all litter when the cat steps out.  But one day when I was barefoot I noticed this grit in my carpet way out in the living room that I had vacuumed two days before..  I swept it up with a brush and yep it was the cat litter.  I checked every room and it was the same.  Any where the cat walked  it was like she had spent a day at the beach.  It also collects between her toes and sticks to the sides of the box much more so than other litters. I have used Clump and Seal  since they first came out with it but I honestly think they've changed it...or I never realized how much the sand would scatter so badly.  I would rather deal with less clean up so sigh...back to square one in search of the perfect litter.  Now if you want	-1
This is the best litter on the market in my humble opinion. I have 3 cats & 3 litter boxes & people entering my home are surprised to see how many cats I have; since there are no detectable odors ; even after a kitty has just done its business. The litter lasts far longer than other multicat brands & will kill the odor as soon as #1 or 2 is covered. Of course the more cats you have the quicker you will need to empty all the litter for a full exchange; but I'm pleased with its longevity & its odor killing function. Liquid waste clumps & it very easy to remove : solid waste once covered with litter us also easy to remove. Keeping the litter clean of waste promptly will prolong the life of the litter even further. If you haven't tried this litter,do it now.you will not be disappointed.	1
Got for my daughter's cat, seemed to like it	1
exactly as expected	1
My cats are 12 years old, and this is the best litter I've come across.  (I like the lightweight even better, because I have a bad back, and it works just as well as this.)	1
Very good product.  Have used it many times & can recommend it to cat owners.  Reasonable price for a good product	1
good product	1
Best litter out there!	1
The best litter around. I will not buy anything else.	1
fine no issues	1
I think this is the best on the market.  I have 5 Cats and hate cat-litter all throw the house. This is not as small as lite-weight nor as large as regular clump litter.  So the Cat's tend to track in their paws less and the Arm and Hammer keep the smells down.	1
The BEST.  Agree with all other reviews.	1
Best stuff since sliced bread.!	1
I really like this litter. I have been using similar types, but they created a lot of dust. This works well for 2 cata and there is no dust.	1
Yes it does clump and is easily cleaned.  The Odor control is not there at all!	-1
This is the best cat litter I've ever tried	1
PRICE, ARRIVAL WAS PERFECT!!!	1
No dust, almost no smell, good clumps and I've tried every litter out there.	1
Great product	1
The name and version says it all. Has not failed me yet with 4 cats and only 2 litter boxes.	1
We only have one cat, but for some reason I can tell (smell) a difference when we don't use this litter for multiple cats. She also has very long fur, so it's impossible for her not to track some litter that gets caught in her hair, but this tracks less than other brands, AND it isn't dusty.	1
This is absolutely by far the best cat litter.  Easiest to scoop that I've ever used and keeps the odor at bay.  Great product and great transaction	1
really doesnt smell. works great in the littermaid box	1
The best cat litter bar none, this is great stuff that lives up to its name.  I have multiple cats, multiple litterboxes, but I'm able to keep them clean and there is no lingering litterbox smell.  I clean them twice a day and they are well used BUT the smell is not there.  I won't push beyond a day but if I had to I know I could come home to a fresh smelling home without the telltale litterbox smell.	1
This cat latter did clump well, but not necessarily better than other products I have used in the past.  My main dislike is that it was soooooo dusty.  Pouring it in the litter box and scooping the clumps out kicks up so much dust that I will not repurchase it.  I also think the smell of the litter was pleasant for me but possibly a turn off for one of my cats who chose to urinate in front of the box on the mat.  I don't know if this was a coincidence or not, but I'd rather not take the chance of offending my cat further.	-1
Nice to have this delivered rather than lugging around at store.	1
this is so great i smell nothing its perfect	1
Best Arm and Hammer litter yet.	1
Good litter!!	1
This is a good gluten free muffin mix.  It is better to add ingredients like nuts, fruit, seeds etc to make it more nutritious and tasty.  They hold together well and are especially good as mini muffins.	1
I didn't purchase this with intentions of making muffins/scones. I needed to find a mix that I could use to make homemade doggy pill pocket like treats so I chose to give this a shot. Unfortunately it didn't work for that purpose but I did end up with some very yummy mini soft baked peanut butter cookie like delights. They were yummy to both humans & dogs so I'd consider buying again with intentions of making muffins or something.	1
This is great muffin mix!  I also used it to make the scones (recipe on the back of the box) with dried apricot pieces and the whole family LOVED them!  I immediately purchased a few more boxes for the pantry.	1
DELICIOUS!!!! My only complaint is that it's hard to stop eating them!	1
delicious, soft chewy, fluffy, and flavorful.	1
This is the first time I tried Udi's. These cookies tasted fresh baked. What a treat! I would absolutely buy again.	1
full of burnt hard cookies without caramel in them, I had one normal one in the bag and realized by that theese are just bad but defective	-1
these cookies were nice, but way too sweet for recipient.	1
Too salty,  and for me to say they are too salty says something.  I don't recommend.	-1
Yum	1
taste awful	-1
Use the product all the time.  Yummy	1
Ok	1
More crumbly than soft but with a weird texture	-1
Love that it's soft and taste good	1
When the box arrived, half of the cookies were crumbs.  When I touched the other cookies, they crumbled.  The crumbs tasted stale and were flavorless.  Very gross.  Don't buy.	-1
okay	1
These cookies looked and sounded good. However, as another review said, they taste like I'd imagine saw dust would taste. Not much flavor. A rather gritty texture.	-1
Great Purchase!!!	1
Gave as part of a gift basket and they were enjoyed by the recipient.	1
A little dry!	1
These are very very very salty, and really chewy. I usually love Udi's, but I won't be buying these again.  They have the texture of playdough, and taste like salty flour.	-1
Great cookies!	1
Not to shabby	1
Nice concept, but needs work. The cookies are seriously dry. Crunchy cookies don't have to be dry. They're like eating dirt.	-1
Great gluten free cookie love it with milk	1
Really good cookies, but quite dry so milk is recommended when eating them.	1
Even my child without gluten intolerance prefers these cookies over the other brands.	1
These cookies fill a void with not being able to have gluten.  They are dry and have a slight aftertaste once you have eaten them.	1
Delicious.	1
A++	1
Kinda tasteless. Fills the void but doesn't really please. **Edit: After finishing this product, I raised it to 4 stars because "filling the void" while being healthy has increased in importance to me. I'm going to order more.	1
FOR UR  GLUTEN FREE  FRIENDS	1
I thought these were good to be gluten free.	1
Dry very unusual for me not to like Uldi product.	-1
Tasteless and horrible!  DRY!  MEALLY!!  This is the worst one yet!  Will NEVER buy this product ever again!	-1
I've been buying a lot of gluten free foods lately.  These cooking are not crunchy (the way I like) but semi soft.  They have a nice taste and I would buy them again.  I haven't found any cookie that I love yet.	1
This are shockingly good cookies. I bought them for my wife, but I've had a fair number.  I actually forgot they were GF.	1
They were pretty good	1
I am a junk food nut, and a health nut...this is a problem, but not with glutino. These cookies are great, thanks for a great product!	1
Awesome!!	1
Great tasting chocolate chip cookies that happen to be gluten free. My one complaint is simply that I wasn't expecting them to actually taste really good so I ended up eating them faster than expected!	1
Better when heated.	1
Great fresh and get chewy when slightly stale. The stale ones are great (sometimes I leave them open on purpose). They're an awesome alternative to Chips Ahoy	1
These are superb, with a nice buttery flavor. They're MUCH better than I thought they'd be! Most highly recommended!  PS--They're crunchy cookies, not soft-baked ones.	1
I got these for one of my daughters that is Gluten Free, but they never made it to her house. I couldn't resist and then I couldn't stop taking a couple here and there.	1
Good breakfast food	1
This tasted great but disappears way too fast!	1
Well made, tasty granola.  Not too sweet, but could have a little more dried fruit in it if I was being really picky	1
delicious granola	1
not a fan of the giant sugared walnuts, but the rest of it was super yum, and reasonably priced enough, I didn't mind stealing some from my celiac husband for my own snacking.	1
It had green moss and inedible.  Packaged was not torn/ripped/ or cracked.  Bad quality.	-1
These are tasty. They are packaged well.	1
These are so far the only gluten free food I have found that is good. They are better than any other prepackaged cookies at all.	1
These are really good. Soft and delicious!	1
these are greatt!!!!!	1
Love the taste, but I'm not fond of the texture, so I won't be purchasing again, especially at GF prices. I don't know how to explain it very well since it's simply a personal preference (4 stars, because it doesn't seem fair to down-rate a product for that reason alone, but 5 stars would not be accurate either).  I would describe this cookie as sort of a cross between a shortbread cookie and a chewy cookie, and I've never been crazy about the crumbly "dustiness" of shortbread cookies. If you like shortbread as well as chewier cookies and must eat Gluten Free, you will probably love it, and find it worth the price as a quickie GF treat.  As I said, I did love the taste. xx, mgh (Madelyn Griffith-Haynie - ADDandSoMuchMore dot com) - ADD Coach Training Field founder; ADD Coaching co-founder - "It takes a village to educate a world!"	1
Some of the better GF items I've tried.  Still a little heavy, but delicious.	1
Wonderful.	1
i love all the udi products i've tried .. breads, frozen entrees, but these cookies don't make our list.  there are other gluten free brands out there that i prefer.  i would not purchase them again.	-1
Tasted good but a little dry.	1
It Google thanks	1
Simple and good.	1
Yummy	1
Not very interesting.  Won't order again.	-1
These cookies are pretty tasty for gluten free!  Just enough sweet to fix those cravings, but not overpowering.  They are a little crumbly when you eat them, more on the dry side.	1
if you have poor portion control, watch out... these are some of the best GF cookies I have ever had... including the ones I bake myself!	1
It is hard to find a soft and moist gluten free cookie that doesn't taste like cardboard.  These are the best cookies!	1
Yummy! These things are dangerously delicious. So soft. The flavor is indescribable. They are amazing. Definitely a savor-able dessert or snack. In fact, it's a perfect diabetic snack. Exactly 1 carb choice per cookie.	1
Thank you.	1
ok, but very crispy	1
Really, really good product. Seriously good! Great crunch and taste.	1
These bagel chips do not taste gluten free!! They are amazing, so crunchy and have such great flavor, perfect for spreads or dips! Love them!!	1
Taste good and are crunchy, but not that many in the box.	1
taste like the ground. but if you're on a GF diet, you'll eat whatever the eff comes you're way.	1
Not a fan - very bland tasting & hard to bite. If I hadn't known they were GF I would have assumed they were just stale bagel chips.	-1
taste great if not over browned too crunchy for me	1
Like it very much	1
I love this bagel chips just wish they were a bit softer. They have a great flavor.	1
Crispy and crunchy! Great by themselves or with cheese, meet or for dips.	1
good and yummy.	1
Very hard and crunchy.  Like you need to double check if you chipped a tooth or that was really the bagel chip you bit down on.  I would not purchase again, Maybe if I was making cute petit brushetta for a younger crowd.  Hard to find gluten free replacements though.  Will still with their crackers instead.	-1
My absolute favorite with any cheese!! You don't even know they're gluten free! Taste fantastic	1
These tasted great. I actually used them as gluten free croutons for my salads as well as a snack.	1
These are really good. I feat my son will not get to eat them since I have opened them! But so nice that someone who needs gluten free can have something that is so tasty	1
Good for gluten free	1
Love these as an alternative to crackers or bread.  I do not need gluten free  (wheat free is fine) but these are quite tasty.	1
I've never been a huge fan of breakfast bars, but sometimes I just need to have something quick on hand to grab for breakfast, so I thought I'd give these a try. As far as breakfast bars go, these are actually very good. The size is just about right, and the ratio of filling to crust is good, too.	1
Great with tea for breakfast, afternoon snack or filling car snack instead of buying junk.	1
Not quit all the way there, but pretty good for gluten free, the only ones that I know of that are made gluten free.	1
Excellent and tasty Gluten-Free snack!  Just a tad dry, but most bars are like that.	1
great bars gluten free	1
Thank you!	1
While not big enough to call a breakfast, they are tasty.	1
Lots of strawberry filling and a moist crust make these very enjoyable. Compare to their toaster pastry only lots more jam in the middle.	1
YUM, these are my fav's nice flavor just the right amount of every flavor.  Shipped Quick Arrived in Good Condition.	1
Liked taste	1
These are really good chips. A nice balance between the slight tang of the sour cream and the cheesy cheddar on every chip. These don't taste quite as salty to me as the regular Lays - that's good and bad.... I am certain that I eat way more of these than I mean to! I think the trick to getting them intact in your Pantry box is to limit soft or fragile things to a single box order and the heavy stuff separately.  Update March 2016  I have an adult onset severe soy allergy and to my delight, these chips are soy free. I have been eating them with no problems.	1
Big bag of chips, not stale, always delicious.	1
Very cheesy!	1
Good taste	1
great taste	1
nice taste and very for filling...	1
My favorite Lay's chip flavor is the Cheddar and Sour Cream.  They are so good, they are addicting.	1
Smashed, do not buy with ANYTHING heavy.  Also very limited expiration date.	-1
compliments for the freshness.	1
Yummy goodness, unique lays taste (compared.to.other cheddar/sourcream brands)   I think its the distinct cheese(has an aromatic taste ) that makes the lays stand above others	1
Good	1
yum	1
my favorite chip...	1
Often imitated, never duplicated......	1
Son likes this one	1
Oh, the flavor is delicious, you could not definitely eat one and walk away.  I think they are extremely good, it has the correct consistency of cheese.  It is very finger licking good.  I put this in a category by itself in comparison the original is bland.  I will choose these every time, wish they were in smaller packaging by itself.  Until then, I will continue to share, share and share.	1
One of our favorite chips!  Always fresh!	1
Good chips	1
The ruffles are better in this flavor. These just didn't do it for me.	-1
I can buy any kinda of lays but one kina i like a lot, and they will just about all but that one taste like lays CLASSIC. Why you always lion lays?	-1
Mmmmmmmmmmm goood	1
good	1
Great Product, Works as advertised, definitely recommendThey are quite good, and also pretty tasty just eating dry and right out of the box! Tasty snack, or yummy breakfast! It's prob not the most healthy thing you can be eating in the mornings, but there's certainly worse things to shovel into your mouth too. That is what I was expecting. Just as yummy as I remember, and my kids love it too. The price was great, expiration is quite a ways out, so no worries there. Boxes were packaged well. Great buy all the way around :-) Fresh products. Very satisfied. I recommend Amazon Pantry. Shipping box is very durable. All goods were neatly packaged and arrived safely and undamaged.	1
A++++++++++	1
Enjoyed the chips.	1
I absolutely love Lay's Cheddar and Sour Cream potato chips! They are fabulous to eat by themselves but I also love to smash them up and use them to coat baked chicken or on top of casseroles.  They add a yummy crunch to any gastronomical experience!  I purchased these potato chips at full price and am only providing this experience for any other person considering the purchase of these delicious chips. All opinions and experiences are my own. Thank you!	1
Good as as the store	1
I enjoy both cheddar cheese and I like the well known sour cream and onion flavor, so I that it would be a wise decision to try these chips that combine those two flavors. I can honestly tell you I was not disappointed! The flavor is a little hard to describe but as you would imagine, you get a nice cheesy overtone with the distinctive flavor of sour cream near the end. They are quite addictive and not as salty as one would imagine. They are fairly thin and crispy so I would not recommend these for any kind of thick dip because they will break apart. They are perfectly fine by themselves anyway and don't require any kind of topping at all since they already come coated with that unique flavoring. Being that these are so light, you can hardly stop from eating them and they will go quickly in a house of hungry people (this size bag would probably last my family anywhere from a week to two weeks or even as little as a day depending on our self-control). This would be a great idea for parties, especially if it was paired with another type of chip that could be used for dipping. This flavor would also be great for parties because it appeals to almost all people (with taste buds). The common misconception is that these chip bags are all air, but that could not be further from the truth. While these bags do contain nitrogen to preserve the chips, they contain the same amount of chips as every other variety. I do find, however, that about 5 to 10 percent of the chips on the bottom get crushed, but this might not happen to everyone, and in reality, this phenomenon is quite normal. With a price so low and the convenience of buying these online, it is hard to pass up such a deal! I highly recommend this product to everyone!	1
Finally out of this, we opened this right away as soon as the package arrive.  This kind of flavor is so delicious.	1
My kids love these chips!	1
A very tasty chip. I like the pungent smell of some cheeses and this has that potent aged cheddar smell to it. Not all like that smell so if you do not like the smell this might not be the chip for you. I have no problem with it and find these to be a flavorful bag of chips.	1
These are my most favorite chips ever! Sadly, they are not available in my region (BOO!!). Thankfully, I was able to get them online and into my belly promptly.	1
These are terrific .... love  them to take on run.	1
Good.	1
I really like these bars.  They have a really good taste to them, not that "healthy" taste.  They are a great mid morning or mid afternoon snack on the go or at work.	1
ITS A NO-BAKE COOKIE!!!!!	1
Great flavor	1
These are great! Will definitely purchase again.	1
Great taste.	1
Good taste. Not a bad price. But with it having peanut butter it had to be good. I worse than a kid when it comes to snacks. I still like my peanut butter.	1
Very nutty and filling. I liked these	1
Not good at all. It's hard to describe the taste. I like other Bear Naked bars, just not this one.	-1
I like Almond milk.  It does not seem to have the questionable side effects as soy. The taste is clean and it does not cause my cholesterol levels to be effected.  I like the vanilla  - it is very lightly flavored and is perfect in my tea.  I use milk in coffee, cereal and tea and am so glad that I switched to Almond milk,  I've tried a few brands and to me Silk is the best.	1
A great way to get some extra calcium for all the milk haters out there. It's delicious and makes you feel great.	1
good value	1
thankU great product	1
Great deal when you find it on sale! Shelf stable as well.	1
Very small cartons. Still a good product.	1
Very convenient	1
this stuff tastes soooo good!	1
This stuff tastes pretty good.  Convenient.  Lasts long time until opened.  Still lasts longer than they say on the box, when opened. Not really like milk, but it's its own thing.	1
really good supply kept me from wasting unused milk.	1
There is some weird taste to prime pantry. It taste almost expired. Sad and waste of money.	-1
I love my Almond Vanilla Milk.  Make shakes with it all the time!  Thanks for carrying it on Amazon!!!	1
great product	1
My family always enjoys this	1
This is a very good milk and it has such a good taste.  I could never go back to regular milk and if you are lactose intolerant (like Me), this is avery good choice.	1
Easy to use	1
Worth every penny	1
love love love this milk never having it till now hating item only equals six	1
I love this milk! I love that I can purchase 6 at a time ! I am making more green tea smoothies and use this plus it has a long shelf life! Much better than milk for me!	1
Just as good as you can get in the store.	1
Everything arrived as expected Great Company	1
Great product	1
Ive switched over to non-dairy milk solely because I like the taste better. I also like that I can buy this almond milk in bulk and store in my pantry until I'm ready to use it. As someone who lives with only 1 other person who doesnt even drink milk, I was throwing out dairy milk way too fast because i wasmt going through it fast enough. With this almond milk, I go through about 1 quart a week. "well why not buy only 1 quart of dairy milk" BECAUSE I LOVE THE TASTE OF THIS VANILLA ALMOND MILK BETTER.  Definitely get this if you hate dairy milk, can't have dairy milk, find yourself throwing out dairy milk way too often, or want to feel better about not helping fund animal cruelty :P	1
as expected! Thank you!	1
Great milk for use in cereal and for mixing in with other ingredients for cooking and baking and just drinking out of a glass.  It's nice not having the milk turn sour like that purchased at the grocery store.  I will be purchasing this milk again in the future, since it's great always having milk on hand when needed and not being concerned with its turning sour.	1
Tastes great, but it's expensive on here. Not worth buying it anymore.	1
The vanilla is pretty good, though a little sweet.	1
A	1
Always good.  I keep it as a staple item in my pantry.	1
I buy 3 of these boxes a month.	1
THICK TEXTURE DID NOT LOVE IT. ALSO A BIT TOO SWEET,	-1
We prefer silk milk to regular.. These are nice because if traveling we can take them without refrigerating	1
great product	1
Delicious on cereal and doesn't cause me heart burn! I'll never drink cow's milk again!	1
yeah now I actually have a way of having a reserve for when I can't get to the store for a few days.....this is the first time I tried the vanilla and it is not overbearing...very good	1
great product	1
If you drink Almond Milk, you can finish these in time. I didn't think I could do it, but I'm 2 months too early. Ready to place my second order!	1
Great	1
excellent! box a little difficult to open	1
Glad to have this product on hand in this form when we run out of regular milk.  It's also good in recipes and, of course, just for drinking.	1
It's the tastiest option on the market. Goes good in coffee.	1
Good taste  on my morning cereal	1
I have never had almond milk before... Or any Dairy milk alternative for that matter. I ordered this to have a standby for my toddler, when we run out of regular milk.  Chilled one and gave it a try. WoW! It's actually really good! Slight almond taste, mild sweetness but very "milk like" texture.  This will work!  Thanks Silk!	1
Great flavor and good deal!	1
Like size of carton and flavor.	1
Amazing!! I thought these were the little milk boxes, but they're big, even better!!	1
I'm lactose intolerant and there are few milk products I can use. I like the taste of vanilla so almond milk is perfect for me. I use it on my cereal.	1
Awesome!	1
Great Almong milk product with excellent shelf life and price delivered to my front door.	1
Tastes like yummy vanilla ice cream. I fill drinking glasses about 1/4 full, freeze pour milk in. The ice keeps the milk frosty cold. Highly recommend, have been using for years, will buy many more times in the decades to come.	1
I love almond milk!  The cartons are small for me.  But it's still really delicious.	1
Very economical and cheap.. Love them! Healthy, and hello, it's so cheaper than Duane Reade's! :)	1
The entire family loves it	1
Great product and service.	1
good deal, good product	1
very good product.  I use it now in my morning protein shake instead of soy milk	1
Just what I ordered.  A good coffee "creamer" and just to drink.	1
Great shelf life.  Doesn't need refrigeration until opened.	1
Great!	1
If you want something a bit less sweet, go for unsweetened vanilla (of course). I get this kind for making AMAZING shakes, smoothies, and hot cocoa. YUM.	1
Very healthy and happy with this purchase!!	1
I think this tastes great- I should have read the package that these were packaged in quarts.	1
I got tired of pouring out a bowl of cereal and opening the refrigerator only to find that someone had used the last of the milk, so I started keeping some Almond Breeze in the pantry. The vanilla flavor I think is great with cereal, coffee, and oatmeal. I also keep the unflavored variety on hand for cooking and baking, it has been a lifesaver for situations where I suddenly realize I don't have enough milk for a recipe in progress.  It keeps for several months, no refrigeration required until you open it. I'm not really a fan of drinking it "straight," but it's a really useful staple to keep stocked in your pantry (particularly if you don't use a lot of milk on a frequent basis).	1
I am addicted to this milk.  I use it for everything from baking to smoothies and cereals.  Wonderful Vegan choice. YUM	1
love this stuff arrived quickly	1
I like this product.  It was a good deal on a pack of 6.	1
Yummy nutty milk at a great price! Quite a bit cheaper price than in stores.	1
great	1
Very tasty mild alternative	1
I've used Silk almond milk for several years, and this shelf stable pack is a nice alternative to the 2 quart refrigerated carton I usually get. My son doesn't drink dairy milk, and he also likes the taste of this.	1
Great product arrived on time....	1
My whole family loves this milk. Its so good for you and all natural! Give it a try and you will see.	1
Great product.	1
I love these bars.  These are my favorite bars that I have ever had.  I love the sweet frosting on the outside and the fruit in the middle.  It is great.  The only problem is I eat them too fast, and sometimes when I am tired I will just eat two of them for dinner at night.	1
The bars taste good and they do satisfy the hunger at the moment.	1
Your in a hurry, you need to eat something but what, you don't have the time to stop to make something. Keep Special K Protein Meal Bars on hand and the problem is solved. Something that taste this good and contains 10 grams of protein and 5g of fiber you would think is impossible but this bar shows it is possible.	1
Decent flavor, in my opinion not chalky. A little sweet for me, but I still won't hesitate to grab one if I need something on the go.	1
Kellogg's makes my favorite protein bar. It doesn't taste like cardboard, sawdust, or like you're chewing like a wild animal in a wheat field. This protein bar is sweet, filling, and delicious. By far my favorite.	1
nice product would buy again	1
Good brand, nutritious and delicious.	1
Didn't care for them. Very sweet.	1
husband loved them	1
Great tasting bars	1
Maybe too sweet but still good	1
My husband really loves these bars. He eats one almost every day for his lunch with fruit.	1
Greamy good.	1
These are good.	1
Yummmm!	1
TY pantry for helping me help others	1
For a meal bar these are the best ones I have found.	1
These were tolerable but not the greatest. I'm not the biggest fan of protein bars anyway but had high hopes because these were Special K. I found them to have that yucky, chalky protein bar taste that just about every other bar has. I could only manage to eat about a half of a bar at a time and only then with plenty of water. Luckily my kids didn't mind them so they didn't go to waste.	-1
I think these are very tasty!	1
These are delicious and nutritious, I love them and will definitely be ordering more. The chocolate ones are great too.	1
Flavor is okay,  but the strawberry pieces are a little too chewy.	1
My missing start may not be fair, as there are few health bars that i would describe as "delicious". This bar is good, but is a but dry/chalky and I find it difficult to get through eating the second half. The main composition of the bar seems to be bland rice crisps, the only thing adding flavor and texture is the berries and yogurt coating.	1
A little too sweet for my taste.  the kids eat them instead of candy bars.  I guess its better for them.	1
received correct item in timely manner, delicious	1
VERY GOOD LATE DAY SNACK OR MEAL SKIPPER	1
Breakfast of champions	1
I bit hard to bite into at first, but then gets nice and chewy.. Flavor is nice and not off putting.	1
I am anot a big fan of granola bars or meal bars but these Special K bars helped keep me full for a few hours.  I usually have one before work to help keep me full until I am able to take my lunch.  The flavor of these bars are pretty good, strawberry with a vanilla yogurt coating.	1
I have had these bars before and this is a repeat purchase so I guess you can say I like them!	1
Good taste, decent consistency	1
Very filling. Very tasty too. One of these and a bottle of water and lunch is GameOver. This has a less sweeter taste than previous versions with less protein and taste less like a candy bar but this is a Prime good grab for meal replacement.	1
Very tasty, but way too much sugar!	1
Delicious and helps keep me full as a great snack during work.	1
Pretty good, but a little too sweet.	1
Special K always has great tasting bars for anyone who may be dieting or just wanting a little snack in between meals. This protein bar really helps to curb my apatite in between lunch and dinner, and the strawberries always make it feel like summer!	1
These taste like Captain Crunch Berries cereal!  So just a forewarning, these might be a little too sweet for most adults' tastebuds.  They were even a little too sweet for mine in the morning, because sugar first thing in the day can be a little too much for my stomach.  But they were fine for the rest of the day.  They were good for tiding me over between classes and appointments, and they helped round out an unbalanced meal.  They definitely taste more like cereal than the average protein bar.  I appreciated that they didn't have the nasty mealy, grainy, or gummy texture that many protein bars have, making it much easier to get it down; I kind of liked the combination of crunchy, chewy, and creamy textures that it had.  It definitely tastes more like a sweet snack than a protein bar.  I don't recommend bringing these on camping trips or to hot places because the outer coating will likely melt and get quite messy.  Making for a nice change of pace from standard granola bars and protein bars.  I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase these again, but if they were to go on sale or something, I might purchase them again, because it's always good to have snacks on hand.	1
Easy to grab and go	1
No body liked them.	-1
These are so good! I doubt they're healthy but they have to be somewhat better then eating a candy bar.	1
easy to get with a kid who can't bring nuts to school	1
Delicious product!  This is a high protein bar and yet it has an impressive fresh flavor.  Most protein bars or drinks taste heavy and flavorless, and you need to choke them down, not with Special K Protein bars, they are like eating a flavorful treat!  I use them for after my exercise classes, and, they are great!	1
this meal bar tastes great	1
Absolutely, 100%, not joking, wonderfully delicious. Which mean it's bad for me, right? Nope, not at all. Just check the ingredients and then give it a try. Very satisfying!	1
I did purchase these on Amazon. These are great even though they do rust.  I generally use one to do a set of dishes with and then toss it.  They come with lots of soap already in the pad, and are great for cleaning up really dirty pots and pans with stuff stuck to them.  I don't always need one, but if I have a lot of dishes and something has stuck on stuff, I get one out.  They are also good for shining up the bottoms of pots and pans.  The soap can be a bit thick and hard to rinse off compared to regular dish soap, but it really cuts through grease and seems to help soften baked on residue so it can be removed easier.  I love them, and try to always keep a box around.  These smell like lemons .  Other than that I can't really tell the difference in this kind and the regular kind  The smell makes these more pleasant to use.	1
Love SOS pads.  Always great for the stainless steal sinks and countertops.	1
nice	1
I've been using SOS since I was a girl, and my mother starting using it when it first came on the market.  It cleans dried on foods very well.  I'm not crazy about the smell or the rust that forms over time, but they are still the best scouring pads around.	1
Have used for years	1
Product is as expected from a reliable brand. Have been using them for decades.	1
works as should	1
These work for just about anything and I used one the other day to scrub out my oven!	1
I'm always a fan of S.O.S. steel wool pads. They don't tend to fall apart like some other brands. I can get my "scrubbing" done without having to throw it away and get a fresh one to finish.  Good choice for baked on food on cast iron!	1
For Tougher scrubbing jobs	1
arrived on time and as described	1
GREAT	1
Best Option.  We hate the cheapies.  SOS brand is worth the price difference.	1
Just as described	1
S.O.S. pads still are the best and I especially love the smell of this one.	1
good price	1
As always a trusted great brand that do the job	1
Thanks	1
Love using these. Cleans up all my messy jobs in the kitchen.	1
These are super for having combined scrubbing power and the Clorox added.	1
These work very well for cleaning the hard to reach spaces in my bathroom.	1
Received as expected	1
My go to shower cleaner.	1
like them	1
They are quick and easy, but don't seem to make the dirty sink/toilet yuckies stay away...not like Soft Scrub does.	1
They work as advertised.  Easy to use and dispose of after cleaning.	1
I used to keep sponges in the bathroom, but they can get pretty grody over time. I like these ScrubSinges because they're a little more abrasive than a sponge for scrubbing, they're infused with a fragrant cleaning agent and they're disposable so I've always got a fresh one available.	1
makes it so much easier to bend over and clean the tub. doesn't take a lot of effort and leaves the tub sparkling clean.	1
These work great--heavily loaded with cleaner and easy to use--take one out, wet it thoroughly and get to work. Lasts several rinses with soap still left at the end of a session of bathroom cleaning.  That said, they're a touch small for my taste-I'd get done cleaning faster with a slightly larger sheet. These are sometimes a bit hard to hold onto.	1
OK. Use plastic gloves with these and have them NOT ship this along with food items, as the bleach gets into the drygoods!	-1
works as advertised.	1
These are really convenient for quick cleaning jobs in the bathroom.  One scrubbing pad will clean the tiles in my shower, or the tub, or the sink and toilet.  They have a good scrubbing surface and are well impregnated with cleaner.  Just add water, scrub, and toss.	1
Love the freshness	1
great	1
Had never tried this product before but am most pleased with the way that it cleans.  For me, living in a small cabin, I have been looking for items that take less space.  This works really well and am most pleased with these.  Definitely will order again.  Prime Pantry works well for me as products are delivered to my door.  At my age, (70's), every step I save is important.  Most highly recommended.	1
Quick easy wipe to clean with.	1
works great	1
So nice to have found these gems. Makes clean up so easy esp in my bathroom. Being in Florida after the hurricane, I still have friends that have now power. I'm able to let them shower and do laundry. These make cleaning shower and bathroom a breeze between visitors.	1
Love it	1
This is awesome for people like me who hate scrubbing showers and tubs.  I can't get the whole family on board with the daily shower spray routine, but I can do this on Saturday morning fast and easy.	1
These really do take out some of the hard water stains in my shower.  I was actually pleasantly surprised.  Almost looked like I had waxed the walls.	1
Item as described.	1
works good in the tub or shower.	1
as expected	1
Great product.	1
Great scrubbers and smells really nice!	1
Great cleaning product.  It has the right amount of cleaner in it.  Works well!  Will use again.	1
These are perfect in the bathroom and work on the kitchen counters for nasty messes	1
I am able to get 3 shower scrubs out of one pad! A nice alternative to scrubbing with a scrub brush every week.	1
These are great & something that you'll always want to have around.  I do.	1
Perfect for what we use it for.	1
Super handy!  These work so well on all surfaces and since they aren't just "wipes", you can rinse and continue using until the whole bathroom is clean!	1
Just what I wanted n good time & a good price.	1
So easy to use,,,, and they clean excellent.  No mess!	1
good	1
I clean for a living and these make cleaning the bathrooms much easier, have ordered more of them and this is the only place I could get them at	1
Not as expected. didn't work for me. whether i'm doing something wrong or they don't work, I don't know. But i tried them with the shower glass few times, no difference.	-1
exactly as expected	1
Clorox is making some darn fine products and this is one of them.	1
Exactly what I wanted	1
On time delivery...no issues	1
Fast shipping-good product.	1
These scrubbers work well and do the cleaning job you'd expect from Clorox. My only complaint is I wish there were a bit more cleaner on them. I feel like the scrubbing quality is good, but the cleaner starts running low before the life of the scrubber does. I end up having to add cleaner to finish the job.	1
The scent is nice.  It made quick work of cleaning the bathroom.  I love them.	1
My first time using these and I have fallen in love. My house is now never without them.	1
These are super convenient and work very well. I use each one for quite a long time. I use the in the kitchen more than the bath.  I'm glad I started using Prime Pantry, or I wouldn't know about these. :-)	1
Handy product	1
Pretty cool!  I cut mine in half if I am doing a small area.  Nice scent!	1
they work great	1
Item as described	1
I will have to buy more of this, my husband cleaned the bathroom with one of these- Wow it is so clean and he was cleaning everything in the bath room and it was still ready to go for more. It had so many bubbles and it smelt so good. I was really impressed!	1
Love the scent of these scrub singles. I used them today and they work wonderfully and long lasting.	1
good	1
I love these cleaners and you cant beat the value of them.	1
So easy to use.	1
How did it take so long for me to discover these?  I am entirely in love with the Scrub Singles.  My guy is a messy man and this makes wiping down the bathroom easy and fast.  It does leave a residue if you don't dry well with paper towel.	1
Love the smell  good cleaning too.	1
These are the best scrubber for scrubbing your bath tub. No chemicals needed. Just wet them and start cleaning!	1
i like	1
How did I live without this product my whole life?! I just took off all my soap scum on my glass shower doors with half a pad in 3 minutes when I tried scrubbing before with a brush and cleaner only for most of it to stay on. This is magic! Cut it in half it has A LOT of product!	1
Perfect for scrubbing tubs, sinks, etc.	1
These are the perfect in-between of cleaning from a paper towel and pulling out the can of abrasive cleaner and sponge. I keep them on my counter top so I can grab them when I think "Who let that stain the counter?!" and "Why doesn't anybody clean the counter before this stuff drys on?!" Then I realize that I live alone and shut up. Honestly I do use them a couple of times before the soap wears out (I live alone, I don't get really big messes) So I really do like them. Calling the scent "clean rain" sure is a reach but then again green apple hard candy doesn't taste like a real green apple either.	1
They work pretty good really similar to magic eraser	1
very handy use them a lot	1
I LOVE THESE. NO MOLD OR MILDEW SMELL EVER.  GETS IN CORNERS MORE EASILY THAN A SPONGE. NGOOD FOR MULTIPLE USES BUT IF YOU'VE BEEN FORCED TO USE ON ANYTHING DISGUSTING (CAT HEAVES ON YOUR BEDSIDE) THEY ARE INEXPENSIVE ENOUGH TO TOSS.	1
Wonderful.	1
item as described	1
Cleans the tub surprisingly quite well! Will need to get a separate box to have on hand for the sinks.	1
Nice product.	1
Easy to use	1
These are awesome! I don't think I've scrubbed my shower walls in 4 years and it took the soap scum off with one pad! Well worth the money! I highly recommend these for every household!	1
Like the results of this product, also smells good.  I use mostly in bathroom.  Convenience is a plus, easy to use makes it worth the purchase.  I recommend this product for constant cleaning tasks.  Will make this product one of my regular purchases.	1
nice	1
These are so convenient! They do a great job scrubbing bathtubs and shower tile!	1
Great for a quick wipe through of the bathroom, in between regular cleanings. Plenty of cleansing action, the scrubby side is rough enough to really scrub off stubborn spots. I was lazy one day and scrubbed my entire bathroom flour with ONE of these.	1
Work very well to clean tiolet. Quick to setup and use. Leave a pleasant scent. Easy clean up.	1
Easy to use and make my clean day fast and better to do it.	1
these are so great at getting soap scum off the glass shower door. FINALLY!	1
I really don't like cleaning...who does? With a pair of disposable gloves, I like using this product to scrub first the sink, the tub, then the toilet and then throw everything away without looking back. Well, I do look back to rinse off everything and then dry it with a paper towel. Overall, I'm happy to not get my hands dirty.	1
Love these new individual cleaners...didn't notice  they were for bath only when I purchased them....hope they also have for kitchen!	1
Bought it from curiosity. Never used before. Looks like it works and although it says one time use, I use the scrubs more than one and it still works. You can throw away after couple of uses. No need to worry about cleaning over and over.	1
First time to use them. They work pretty good.	1
works great	1
I just used these and boy do I love them!!  I used one to clean my whole bathroom (It is fairly small).  I started with the shower and used the scrub side.  I just would rewet after a little cleaning and it would suds up again.  After I was done just tossed it in the garbage.  I am definitely ordering these again.	1
yea.  a new way to scrub shower scum.	1
Talk about convenience! You gotta love these scrub singles. I can easily scrub the shower floor and walls, sinks with ease. no residue, rinses easily. I'm not going back to the powder comet and a scrub brush!	1
Scrub A Dub Dub, tolet is not cranter than the tub!!	1
good product....fast ship	1
I love these for my cleaning clients. Less messy and cumbersome that carrying a bottle of product and rags. Lightweight, VERY effective, long usage, multiple applications (not just bathroom). Recommend!	1
great!	1
Lasts longer then I expected and does a nice job.	1
Scrub your tub and shower, then use it to clean the toilet and toss in the trash. Easy, no mess and works well.	1
great	1
Great ..	1
These things are quite handy! They actually do a pretty decent job. That even surprised me I wasn't expecting much to be honest. But they do a pretty good job	1
Works ok. Still testing its limitations if any	1
Bought some of these singles before. They're great for those small to big clean-ups. Need to scrub some they work for that too.	1
Perfect for between cleaning days. Removes soap scum easily.  Easy to use!	1
I love using these scrubs to clean my bathroom, just wet them down and go to town	1
These make cleaning so much easier and faster. I own a house cleaning business so I am always looking for products to make my job easier and cut down on time. These are great because the one side is a scrub pad (similar to scrub pad for dishes so it doesn't scratch) and the other is like a magic eraser. These also have a bit of clorox built in to them that is activated with water. I don't wear gloves usually as most products i use are all natural and thankfully, the solution in these do not irritate my skin and the scent is not overwhelming (where a lot of bleach products are so overwhelming that I need to open a window). I like to spray my favorite cleaning solution and let it set a second, wet the pad, use the scrub side, use the eraser side, rinse with water, and then, wipe with a rag or paper towel. For shiny surfaces, I'll spray some glass cleaner and wipe with a paper towel as my last step. I receive compliments from clients all of the time on how their homes look better than ever after cleaning (and using this product).	1
This wipes are great--they clean the tub really well without harsh chemicals and I use them to wipe down the top of the white moldings in the bathroom, too.  Definitely will be repurchasing.	1
Do not clean well at all	-1
Cleans well...	1
works well	1
These little scrubs are fantastic for the bathroom! They have cleaner in them already, add some water and scrub your little heart out and when you are done, pop it right in the trash! Love it!	1
I love these little scrubs. Clean and toss plus Clorox products have been in my household for at least 30 years, Very trusted item for me.	1
I like individual cleaning pads like this because you do not have to use a sponge or a rag. Everything you need to clean with is right in a Scrub Single. I use them multiple times too.	1
New product.  Works nicely.  I will see how well they stand up.	1
Great product, Fast shipping!	1
I bought these from Prime Pantry~ my first time to shop the site. The Clorox Scrub Singles are terrific and so handy in keeping the bathroom clean. My tub gets  a good cleaning each week and these little pads are wonderful. I tend to keep the rest clean at all times. I really like that when you're done with it you just throw the pad away.https://www.amazon.com/review/R2CYRINRAO76AM/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U5G2JJO	1
Anything that can make cleaning easier is a good idea in my book. These are great for quick spot cleaning in the kitchen or the bathroom. They even smell okay.	1
Just okay, not more scrubbing power than my scrubber sponge at the sink.  The soap on it doesn't last long.  I won't buy it again.	-1
great product	1
Great idea, leaves the shower smelling great, but not enough scrubbing power.	-1
I love these. They make it so easy to clean my fiberglass tub.	1
Great!	1
Got rid of all the gunk in my bathtub including the blue from my hair dye.	1
My wife likes them , great for cleaning the stainless sink.	1
These smells fresh and are great for cleaning the bathroom. They have plenty of cleaner in them. In fact, my sink was full of bubbles after using one. No more nasty toilet brushes for yucky sponges in the bathroom. Scrubby on one side and soft on the other.  These are also good for maintaining a clean bathroom in between doing heavier deep cleanings.  Also great for when you have to clean in a rush. These are just a great idea.	1
Great products	1
These are a super convenient cleaning scrub cloth that I found works really well on all bathroom surfaces. You just wet the cloth and it suds up quickly - then you get to work with the scrubbing side, and you can wipe down less dirty areas with the smooth side.  There were two minor things that I wasn't so keen on - you really need to wear gloves when using these cloths, as the cleaning agent is tough on hands (but I expect most people use gloves when cleaning anyhow). Also, there are almost too many bubbles! The cloth can foam up so much that you need to go over cleaned areas with a damp sponge to get rid of excess foam and streaks.  Nevertheless, these are great at cleaning bathroom soap scum, water stains, and the toilet, and it doesn't have an overpowering scent. They cover a lot of area, and one or two cloths will do the whole of my bathroom (quite large). Once you're done - just toss the cloth out - simple! I liked these cloths a lot and would both recommend them, and buy again.	1
These are alright...in a pinch. They are okay for cleaning...I'd love them to be bigger...they do leave behind a lot of suds, but I don't mind that, I just wish they were a bit bigger to really clean an area.  I wouldn't purchase again. Not really worth the money.	-1
love it!	1
I like these things they are cheap and I can clean my whole bathroom with one of them	1
Love these for cleaning the tub, worked great	1
Super cleaner. They work suprisingly well. I didn't have super high hopes for it but they do a nice job and you can toss them when done. You can clean two bathrooms with it and it seems to have a little more left to go if you push it	1
AS advertised.	1
no	1
They served their purpose well of scrubbing my sinks without wasting a while big sponge or having to reuse such!	1
Fast shipping. Just as described.	1
These are great for bathrooms and germy areas.	1
love these scrubs.  So convenient to use!	1
These are perfect for the bathroom. Clean and shine. Go a long way. Love. Will stay with this product	1
Box was partially opened when it arrived. These are decent.	1
These are great. I like not having to keep and nasty tub brush any more. The scrub side works really well to clean my whole tub. I love that it doesn't have a strong or weird smell to them. Just rinse with water and scrub away!	1
Fantastic cleaning product and a great scent.	1
If you have soap scum look no further. I have honestly tried no less than 10 product and only Bar Keepers Friend has worked as well. These scrub pads are really easy to use and I just bring one in the shower with me once or twice a week and it takes only a few minutes.	1
work great for small bathroom cleanups like a quick scrub of the tub.	1
It's SCRUB SINGLES, meaning it should be good for one time, but I can used this to wash 4 sinks, one bath tub, and one shower stall. I am so satisfy with this! It cleans and wipes and doesn't smell bad! I am going to see if I can reuse this again for a second time around, so far, the scrub is still in a good condition!	1
I really love these scrubs. My kids and I use them in our bathroom. The work well for weekly and daily cleaning and best of all are discarded after use rather than having sponges or scrub pads growing bacteria between uses. Long time customer here !!	1
These are the bathroom scrubs.  What a nice lasting scent.  My bathroom smells so super nice when I am done.  Lasts a long time. I can use it on my bathtub, shower walls, sink, toilet, counter top.  Once again, Clorox does not let you down.  These are definitely worth every penny, and last a long time	1
These are nice but the regular are great too.	1
If you are looking for a little extra scrubbing power when you are cleaning up these work great to even remove grease from floors and counters. I use these with gloves since sometimes at the end of a container you need to wring them out a bit. I also use these to clean up any spills on the floor, especially under the dining room table. They also work great for cleaning off moldings and places the mop can't get to easily.  ~The Rebecca Review	1
Cleans your tub of tiles like magic. Wish I had discovered this earlier. Jackpot. Will definitely reorder again. Definitely better than the can of cleanser and a paper towel or sponge and that back breaking scrubbing. This does it for you with no effort. Has a scrubbing pad that works terrific.  Thank you for making house work easier and letting me take a bath I haven't taken in years. My tub never seemed clean enough until I used these. Gets to the nitty gritty. No more shaking of the cleansers and inhaling the bleach fumes until you gag. RECOMMENDED	1
Just as described.  Great.  Would purchase from this vendor again.	1
Easy way to clean	1
Amazing although I do love all Clorox products.  Great in Kitchen, bathroom, out on my deck....can be used anywhere.  The scrubbing side is perfect for tough areas.  Smooth side prefect to just wipe down real quick	1
great	1
These are great for quick jobs cleaning up banisters and counters to help keep them fresh and disinfected.	1
good!	1
Works great as a laundry boost. I have three kids and i do a lot of laundry. They don't always tell me about stains but this takes them out anyway.	1
I use it anyway, and it's particularly convenient to order via Amazon Prime because I have a couple of sets of stairs to navigate when I do groceries, and like to have the heavy jugs delivered to my door when possible.  It's useful on stains, no miracles, just good stuff.  I use it only for whites or light colors, because with regular use it will dull bright colored laundry.  OK for occasional use on colors though.	1
Works great for the tub and shower!  easy to sue and convent.	1
Wow these are really amazing. Easy to use and even easier to clean with. Perfect amout of cleaners built in, just wet and use. Not over powering at all and with a scrubber on one side and softer side on the other able to use on multiple surfaces.	1
Easy to use, good clean smell, does a nice job. Wish they were a little bigger in size and available in larger count boxes. Works better and thicker than the wipes in the round cans. Almost perfect!	1
these are great to clean with, single use is awesome. use them once & throw it away. cleans very well	1
These worked very well for me.	1
excellent product	1
A little pricey, but very convenient to have in bath and/or kitchen, anywhere you have counters.	1
Great cleaning product! It's Clorox. Easy to you & you get a lot of use of it before you throw it away	1
Perfect	1
I bought these on a whim in my Pantry box and I am going to keep them on hand in the future. The scent is light, but fresh and not bleachy. Just wet them like a wash rag and scrub,  rinse the surface, toss the scrub/wipe and you're done. I have a big walk in shower with glass on three sides and solid marble on the fourth side and a marble tile floor & seat. Keeping it beautiful, clean and free of soap/moisturizer/facial products film is a constant obnoxious chore.   These scrub singles are a little bigger than my palm and they bubble up and definitely get the soap and other stuff off the marble and glass. The smooth side is nice for the chrome fixtures - no scratches. Using these in the kitchen is equally handy - they got dried tomato sauce off a pan easily and grime off the mudroom baseboards.	1
These do an amazing job	1
Perfect for the quick cleanup of bathroom sinks and tubs.  I can usually get two uses out of one scrub.  Smell does not overwhelm you when using these.	1
these work great.	1
Really do the job	1
Nice product.	1
When I first tried these wipes with the micro-scrubbers, they felt a little weird and kind of creepy.  However, after using them to clean my stainless steel sink, I wouldn't buy any other kind.  I hate my sink because it always looks bad with the obvious water stains.  These new wipes did a great job of removing the water stains (on the chrome faucet too).  And without much scrubbing.  I'm very impressed.	1
Love these! Use them on EVERYTHING! Especially hard to clean stuff as they have a abrasive side to each wipe!	1
good price	1
wonderful stuff.	1
Good for colored items Price was good	1
works great in my laundry....clothes come out looking at smelling great....not to harsh...just right...great for removing stains...use all of the time for all colors	1
I love it	1
I really like these sponges, they have a nice smell and they work well. I have 22 month old twin girls and they found crayons and colored all over the walls and a plastic princess castle, nothing was taking it off so I tried these and its all off. I think this is a great buy and I will buy more.	1
Great product. Love having the things I want delivered to my door.	1
This is a nice product and it makes things sparkle!	1
Works fair. Almost nothing ever seems to work as good as the commercials though. Still it does help	1
works good  on  protein stains and  colors	1
Wonderful for color stained clothing.	1
Use these to sanitize areas for our dog.	1
work well	1
Love the ease of wiping up messes and disinfecting at the same time. Love convenience of 2 day shipping in my pantry box.	1
these are really nice to use in the kitchen or bath--I use them on the sinks or counter tops for quick clean ups	1
cleans my bathroom vanity top perfectly. My cat lives in my bathroom and won't leave for some reason to go out in the rest of the house. I use this to sanitize her area. Kills germs and cleans up the junk she has left on the counter	1
does the job	1
I use this with every load.  Our clothes come out nice, bright colored and stains are gone.	1
GOOD	1
I've honestly no clue how this solution makes colors more vibrant or at least how it makes colors more vibrant beyond regular detergent.  I suspect this is snake oil as I cannot see the difference between regular suds and these suds.	-1
Put it in with my colors and it stained some of them.	-1
Strips package was opened upon arrival in the Amazon Box.  It was missing several strips.  The product works, but not like it is advertised.	-1
These seem old and inauthentic. They don't even stick. Don't trust it!	-1
RESOLVE ALL OVER.  THREW AWAY	-1
Resolve saturated..threw away.	-1
It mixes up easy like a good Jello product but..it doesn't really taste like cheesecake, at all!	-1
Not happy with fact so many other ingredients have to be added.	-1
I just didn't like this. Too sweet.	-1
RESOLVE ALLOVER.  THREW AWAY	-1
Normally I like black cherry, but this jello seemed off. Smell reminded me of cough syrup, and my boyfriend disliked the flavor.	-1
So far I tried the lemon coconut and the cinnamon pecan. They're okay tasting, but not easy to eat. I think because the bars are mostly made of puffed grain, so they are extremely dry. I'm not a big fan of the flavors, but it's nearly impossible to find a protein bar that tastes good and isn't a ton of sugar and calories, so I don't hold the flavor of these bars to a very high standard. I think as a quick supplement to hold you over until a better meal these are fine. I will finish the box and just remember to have a drink handy to help get them down.	-1
Smells, doesn't feel like you've shampooed at all. No fresh smell,I'm going back to Pantene.	-1
I have natural, untreated long hair beyond my shoulders, and this shampoo does little more than make a lot of suds.  I will use it as a house cleaner, and not on my hair again because it was harsh, drying, and dulling on my hair.	-1
It depends on what you are looking for, but this was not what I expected.  It doesn't have a powerful spin like the Spinbrush.  It's more like a vibrating manual toothbrush.  I have a small mouth and this thing felt awkward and uncomfortable, because the head is fairly large.  Plus, the cheek scraper on the bottom was scraping the inside of my mouth while I brushed - I guess that's the point, but it was not something I would do again!  The pros are that the bristles are soft and it's a real gentle cleaning.  I don't think I can get past the cheek scraper though.  Overall, I paid about five dollars and I used it once and I can't return it.  I tried to return it and it's not returnable.  Make sure you really want this thing before you buy it.	-1
lasted a day or two, head too small	-1
This toothbrush went in the trash the 2nd night I used it.  Only one head spins and not very fast at that.  Replaced the battery but it still had no power.  Don't waste your money...the Crest spin brush is much much better and only a few dollars more.	-1
Too hard brush	-1
don't like how small the toothbrush head is. won't be buying again. you definitely get what you pay for	-1
Thank you	-1
You get what you pay for--its a big bottle so theres value in that, but it's not great for your hair. I felt like my hair would get even dryer when I used it, and I was glad to get to the end of the bottle to pick something else. Might be better for people with shorter hair, but for my longer locks, it did no good.	-1
I'm not a fan of the sensitive blades. Using a fresh blade out of the packet, then holding it under the running water in the shower just doesn't work for me. The blades always feel rough and hurts my skin while shaving. I prefer the Venus over these	-1
Very seldom do I purchase from Amazon without reading reviews, but in this case I failed to do so.  I find the bristles way too hard/borderline painful.  My husband wasn't crazy about them either. Also I feel like at any moment the handle is going to snap in half.  Will have to do better research on my next toothbrush purchase, but this will not be purchased again	-1
Way too hard of bristles bj.	-1
SMALL AND CHEAP	-1
This really leaves a greasy feel that won't was off after using. I gave it two stars because Amazon shipped it nicely, but I sure will not buy it again	-1
Glad I didn't buy these for my teeth. Bought these as applicators and for scrubbing sleeves on my workshirts. Could never brush my teeth with a handles the flexes this much.	-1
These are supposed to be reusable, I guess.  Yuk.  They're good to stick in a purse or pocket for a single use, but other than that require an alcohol wipe or other cleaner.  Wouldn't recommend.	-1
Burns my mouth when brushing. Very strong toothpaste. Nothing like Sensodyne. It does help with sensitivity when you're not actually USING it :-/  It contains SLS as a top ingredient, which I think is the reason for the harshness. I also think it causes canker sores.  Won't buy again.	-1
Not my favorite	-1
This is an "okay" toothpaste, but I wouldn't consider it a whitening toothpaste. I have noticed no difference with using this for 3 months. The flavor is toothpaste-y and it isn't super gritty, so I guess those are the only good things I can say about it.	-1
Too hard. It actually hurt to brush my teeth. :( The handle is very uncomfortable as well. I do not recommend them unless you like super hard bristles.	-1
Not nearly strong enough to even begin to go between teeth that are close together.  Not an alternative to floss.  Not good as a toothpick either because they bend so easily.	-1
I purchase Colgate toothbrushes frequently and am quite satisfied with them. However, I am not so happy with this Colgate Extra Clean manual toothbrush. Besides the fact that I found the toothbrush to be surprisingly flimsy, relatively smaller and the bristles harder, I found the handle of this toothbrush to be oddly pointed- for a regular sized hand, the tip of the handle digs uncomfortably in the palm (pics attached for reference). Because of these reasons, I will not be purchasing this particular model of Colgate.	-1
These are very rough toothbrushes. They are very hard and feel like they could damage your gums. I do not recommend these unless you're looking something to scrub with!	-1
I usually really like DenTek flossers but I don't particularly like this version as the floss does a poor job of holding tight on the flosser.  It stretches and leaves behing particles, unlike their other flossers.  The flat floss makes it difficult to properly remove the particles between my teeth and the gum area.  Luckily I floss once a day so I can use these up within a few months!	-1
These break very easily and a small handful are needed to properly floss.  I will not buy these again and probably won't use all that I bought.	-1
It's too stiff. I feel like I'm scratching my teeth, not brushing. Not matter how cheap the product is, I'm not gonna buy this again.  But it was good to use when some biscuit stuck on my wisdom tooth.	-1
I personally don't like the bristles on the pointy part. Like rubbing a brush between your teeth.	-1
You get what you pay for--its a big bottle so theres value in that, but it's not great for your hair. I felt like my hair would get even dryer when I used it, and I was glad to get to the end of the bottle to pick something else. Might be better for people with shorter hair, but for my longer locks, it did no good.	-1
tastes terrible. won't be using it	-1
Flimsy and cheap. Would make a good travel toothbrush because you would not mind loosing it.	-1
You sent me fluoride floss picks... the description says nothing about fluoride!!!  Even the outside of the package is different from the one I thought I was buying!  Wake up people !  This family doesn't do fluoride!!	-1
Breaks very easily	-1
didnt like it	-1
We did not like these toothbrushes at all. First of all the head is very small, and the handle is so thin and tiny that it bends while you are holding it trying to brush your teeth. Also, they are Medium and we prefer Soft bristles, I didn't see that when I placed the order.	-1
Cheap.  You get what you pay for.  I bought these for in our camper.  They'll do the job while camping, but not a good toothbrush for day to day use.	-1
I have been using the regular Maximum strength sensodyne toothpaste for decades but never the whitening one.  So I figured I would give it a try. Big mistake, within 2 days my teeth hurt so bad just eating or drinking Anything! I had to keep pushing my fingers into my teeth to stop the pain.  This is Not what we use sensodyne tooth paste for, we use it to stop the pain.  I DO NOT Recommend using this toothpaste. I had to go back to the old sensodyne to stop the pain. It took a week just so I can even drink water without a straw.	-1
I don't care for these toothbrushes at all. I don't like the bristles or the shape of the head. While there is nothing wrong with them, I have bought cheaper brushes with better results.	-1
Great product, HOWEVER! THis isn't the FULL SIZE, although the price would lead you to believe it was	-1
These tend to break a lot, did not like them.	-1
I like more lather in my shampoo and I suggest you have really dry hair if you use this because it leaves my hair really greasy.	-1
I wanted to like it. I wanted to use a natural deodorant after years of using the another brand which works great and smells great, but not natural. I bought some Toms for my son and one for myself. I honestly thought the boy just didn't wear deodorant or forgot to put it on and lied when I ask him why his pits smells the way it does, but after trying my own Toms today I realize the fault is not my son's, it's the deodorant. We smell like we played a round of golf in 95 f weather, after playing 2 rounds of football. All I did today is shower and grocery shop. No reason why I should smell like I competed in a mud race. I just hope no one noticed me acting suspiciously in the stores. I just could not take the chance and raise my arm to get anything off a shelf smelling like this...so I waited til the aisle area was clear...down each darn aisle. Can't try to be cute, while smelling funky. Nope! Never again...	-1
First off, I could not stand the strong smell of this.  More importantly, it did not do anything at all for me as a deoderant.	-1
thought the smell was nice at first, but by the end of the day it smelled really bad. I am a woman, but at the end of the day I felt like I started smelling a little too "manly". I wore it 2-3 times before just giving up and throwing it out. I'm disappointed because I have been happy with other "Tom's" products. I will be going back to the Apricot version of this, which I like a lot. It's fruity, but it's not too bad. As far as protection goes, just like any other aluminum-free deodorant you can expect to have to re-apply by the end of the day, especially if you are active. However, I've tried a variety of different ones and this one does seem to be the longest-lasting and does the best job. I still find that my armpits get a little wet at times, especially if i have a presentation or something, so I try to switch off days depending on my stress or activity level. Although I definitely noticed that the first week or so was the worst and after that my body started to adjust to not having all of those chemicals blocking my sweat ducts. Now the deodorant works better.	-1
Has little power. Doesn't seem to clean very well. Tedious to have to replace batteries. Works less as the batteries get lower. Wouldn't recommend. I shelled out for an expensive electric toothbrush after owning this one.	-1
The motor on this wasn't as strong as it was on models I purchased in the store. Tried changing the batteries and it made no difference.	-1
This is a box of 6 Hostess cherry pies. The pies are "individually packaged for resale" in little boxes, not in cellophane or sealed bags. Either the recipe has been changed for the worse, or these were incredibly stale: the glaze on the pie was a weird tan color; the crust was too thick and almost crunchy; the filling was a weird, dry, gummy substance. These used to be fairly good - kind of disappointing how bad they are now.	-1
had to replace the batteries when i received it.. it is noisier yet weaker than the oral B one i replaced. the oral b was over a year old and still running strong...wish now i didn't toss it.	-1
These ended up being kind of inconvenient, and I was using an improper technique and hurting myself.  Maybe other people will have better luck.	-1
Long-lasting? Not for my underarms. Had to reapply over & over throughout the day. Oh well, off to find another brand that works.	-1
Other sensitive toothpastes keep teeth feeling cleaner longer.	-1
Does not last at all, I put it on after a shower and it was gone by the time I got downstairs.  The scent is nice until it mixes with sweat then it becomes something terrible like a hippie running a 10k.	-1
Had to give it away - teeth too sensitive for whitening toothpaste.  This cost me a big dentist bill just to find out it was the toothpaste!	-1
Doesn't keep you dry like I had hoped	-1
after a day of sweating i stink, plain and simple, won't buy again. On the up side it smells nice. I used another aluminum chlorhydrate product before and liked it, never could smell myself at end of day. I will go back to that product.	-1
I have many allergies and this caused my gums swelling and soreness so can't use it. It does hold the dentures in very well.  I wish I could use it.	-1
I bought this product expecting it to smell more feminine.  Instead it smells more like Mennen Men's Deodorant.  I gave it to my husband instead.	-1
Not my favorite brand. I just don't like the shape.	-1
i do not like this item, it smells funny, i wish i can return it.	-1
The floss on these picks is very fine, like sewing thread. It would cut my gums quite badly if I wasn't careful. I prefer the picks that have the flat ribbon type of floss.	-1
I really want to like Tom's of Maine deodorant but ugh I just can't hang. Doesn't smell great to begin with and then it last like an hour, I swear. I stick with making my own or Arm & Hammer.	-1
The safe soft bristles but they were actually pretty hard wasn't a fan of these brushes at all	-1
After using two tubes of this "glamorous whitening toothpaste", as directed, I have not noticed any change in the color of whiteness of my teeth. My teeth have always been pretty white but I like my tea and try to keep the staining between cleanings from happening. This did not do a bit of difference!	-1
Not what I expected.	-1
Way too think	-1
Stick with the floss, these break off and they don't do half the job of floss.	-1
Not good at all compare to the ones that I used to buy.	-1
ive seen several people use these and thought i should try it out. I should have stuck with the floss. Now i have several plastic flossing in my trash bin from a single use. depending on the way your teeth are you could be using from two to five. It states that the threading doesn't fall apart but they. i will be going back to regular floss after these are gone. Other then that the pick works great. That's probably the only good thing from this floss. This floss needs some improvements.	-1
These are the cheapest toothbrushes I have ever used.  I would not recommend them to anyone.  The end of the brush handle is so sharp, it could be used as a weapon.  Even with gentle, circular brushing motion, these brushes only last a few weeks before needing to be tossed.  Such a waste.	-1
ARE YOU kidding me??!!  every one of the brushes lost it's bristles!  in my mouth!  even the first time I used one!  gross	-1
Very small	-1
The brush end is good, but the sharp end on the handle is not so good. I like a thicker handle, like the Colgate 360.	-1
the toothbrushs was not in the box.	-1
Gives me a rash	-1
I LOVELOVE THESE  I HAD ORDERED THE BRUSHES  BUT THIS CAME INSTEAD AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THESE  THEY ARE GREAT	-1
I mistakenly bought this. My husband like the deodorant and antiperspirant and this was the deodorant only. Returned it for a full refund.	-1
Oooooof, my first time using Gillette Venus and I think it'll be my last. I know they're popular but the razor nicked up my leg badly on the first use. I used another and had the same results. I've never had other razors abuse my skin like that. Nope, nope, nope!	-1
too oily	-1
They aren't great	-1
kinda ewww scent	-1
These razors are not good if you want a close shave. The protection around them prevents a close shave from happening (but if they slip, OUCH!). The way the head's built makes it impossible to shave some places too, especially the ankles where I usually have a hard time.  These razors are also built for sensitive skin, except I find they irritate my sensitive skin. Whenever I use these, I get a rash and itch like crazy right after my shower. I do not like these razors at all and recommend other Venus razors instead.	-1
Awful razors ! Do not work well and are not comfortable to use.	-1
I don't know when Gillette changed the overall design of this razor, because I did stop using Venus for some time, but the quality is severely lacking. As a woman who has shaved daily for 20+ years and has used this before, its very clear to me it is no longer the same design or quality it used to be. Make sure and order you some bandages if you get this razor, youll need them from the copious amounts of blood that will be streaming down your legs. Gillete, never again!	-1
I do not understand why both my son and husband got a rash from this. It really surprised me!	-1
Did not work well at all...didn't even feel like the blade touched the skin...would not order again.	-1
Seems ok so far.	-1
They dull up way too easily and for the cost?  I'm not too crazy about them.  There are better--and cheaper--ones out there for women.  Disappointed in these.  Would not buy again.	-1
Why can't they make this unscented?  This smell is awful.	-1
NOT WATERPROOF< expensive	-1
too small and been trick by it size seems big but very little tube of tooth paste not so good to me the flavor is so so !!!	-1
Too thick and pastey	-1
Not sure what's original but it's NOT the scent, marks me itch. Tricky labeling !	-1
Way to thin watery disappears like cheap toothpaste. Won't buy again.	-1
burns skin	-1
Garbage. Threw it away. I'd rather let my dog lick my teeth clean.	-1
this is nasty tasting and smelling and so is your mouth after you use it... No one at work or home will use it. Looks pink in the picture but is a weird purple color.	-1
I may have had an allergic reaction to this anti-cavity mouthwash, which I learned the previous day from using another anti-cavity mouthwash ordered at the same time. If you don't have a reaction though, I'm sure it's awesome.	-1
The caps suck. The product just makes my gums bleed	-1
Don't waste your money. I know you get what you pay for, but this wasn't even worth the $10 I spent.	-1
Does not have a strong "pick" end and the floss string breaks very easily. Just not that good really	-1
These break so quickly. Inferior to the brand that makes the green ones.	-1
For me, these are way harder to use than normal floss. I jabbed myself in the gums multiple times, both with the floss itself and with the plastic pieces. It was also hard to reach my back teeth with compared to normal floss.  The one reason I like these is convenience. It's easy to store a few of these in your purse or car for food-stuck-in-your-teeth emergencies. The mint flavor is nice and strong, too. I just can't imagine using these on a daily basis.

Waste of money. It caused a smell more so than if I just didn't even wear deoderant.	-1
When I ordered these it said 8oz twin pack which implies 2 8 oz tubes, but what you really get is 2 4oz tubes and for that, it's very overpriced!	-1
made in 2012, not really fresh	-1
Didn't work, ordered by accident I usually use dove clinical. This is awful  I felt I paid more for a clinical deodorant and got just a regular strength deodorant.	-1
strange scent, unpleasant	-1
With no lather it just doesn't seem to work	-1
Strong fragrance, thanks but I have my own cologne! And t does not smell like pine sol! YUCK	-1
there is a strong chemical taste. no, i'm not referring to listerine's powerful BANG .. i mean chemicals. i threw it out	-1
tastes like chemicals and fake  sweetners	-1
I do not like the after taste	-1
Actually left an acidity after taste.  May be a bit too strong for me.	-1
I took a while to review this deodorant, wondering if I would eventually change my mind about it but I haven't. I normally do not review items that I feel are necessities but this is the first time I was let down by a deodorant. First issue is that it seems drying to my skin. I have never experienced that. It does not go on as smoothly and when I use it I can tell a difference in how my skin feels, in a bad way. It also does not last all day. I used a different brand normally that is not even advertised to be long lasting and it holds better, smells better, and goes on smoother than this one. I purchased this to try it out because it seemed like a good price. I was not impressed. It works, I have just used better.	-1
this is tasty, sweet and smoky. however i did not realize it would have sugar in it.	-1
would not order again because some packages were opened upon arrivil	-1
I'm a snack fanatic. If it's crunchy, I'm sure to have tried it and probably loved it. If you look at my review for Corn Chex, you'll see that I'm a huge fan of the Chex cereals. And Chex Muddy Buddies (soooo gooood). Chex Mix has all the right components- start with an awesome cereal base, add in the right combo of crunchy accessory ingredients, and BAM - you have yourself a perfect snack! But there's something about Chex Mix that leaves my body feeling horrible after I eat too much of it. MSG (Monosodium glutamate) is not listed as an ingredient...but it does have disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate, which are used in conjuction to replace MSG in products. Some believe these two ingredients have a similar effect as MSG on the body - headaches, irritability, discomfort - and that's been my experience as well. Maybe I'm just sensitive, but for that reason I stay away from Chex Mix. I love the crunch...but I hate the unnecessary ingredients.  Some quick facts about the product: - The bag arrived a little man-handled - it looked like a bag that would be at the front of the display in the grocery store. I would have , and I'd probably go for the one behind it. - Expiration date: August 18, 2016  If you'd like more info about Prime Pantry bestsellers, click on my name (PPantryReviews) to check out my website.	-1
Bag was crushed by a case of V8 energy drinks packaged with it.	-1
tastes very dry.	-1
Had to buy 5 things for "free shipping" at Amazon Prime.  This is one of the yukky Triscuit brands.  I think if I had to get 5 of them, I'd rather pay s/h.	-1
this arrived damaged, the box was broken open and the crackers were crushed.	-1
I love triscuits actually and even this one, but I'm rating it two stars because Nabisco is feeding us things that aren't food. GMO's and fillers, lot's of "extras" that are unnessecary to us but make more money for them. Until they change their ingredients, my review will stand at 2 stars.	-1
Did not like these flavor triscuits at all.	-1
While we normally love these crackers and the taste for some reason we ordered a few in this order and the plastic inside was opened.  Therefore the crackers were stale. Even though the box on the outside was sealed.	-1
You're better off using these as pet food.	-1
I thought I liked these when they first came out.  This time, they taste so much like chemicals and have a powdered coating on top of the cracker that i threw the box away.	-1
just do not care and my dog will not even help eating them--threw away	-1
this arrived damaged, the box was broken open and the crackers were crushed.	-1
No one in my family liked these the taste wasn't good at all. Even grandkids disliked these.	-1
Ok if you like your crackers in a million bits. Packing is poor on these so beware.	-1
The Grahams were not fresh, they were soft not crisp and didn't taste good at all. I had to throw away.	-1
fresh stacks are stale	-1
Meh, These don't have near the flavor (or salt) as the originals. I am salt sensitive and maybe add salt to 2% of anything I eat. I had to shake salt in to the box....  If you just need a dipping vehicle for some yummy stuff you made, these will do alright. Make sure to thoroughly drench them though.   As a bonus you can even eat the box afterward as it tastes the same..... which is why I gave these an extra star.	-1
Came crushed	-1
Again Smashed Also	-1
This product has completely changed from what we have purchased as Nabisco Honey Maid grahams in the past.  The box is the first clue as blue and a bit smaller.  But I really noticed the change when opening and trying a couple of crackers.  The consistency of this graham cracker is crisper and harder. Its taste is chalky, sweeter and missing most of the graham flavor.  It crumbled like sawdust in my mouth and i realized immediately something cheap had replaced the familiar ingredients and the recipe had changed. I went online searching for word of a recent change in the product as i had missed seeing any announcement.  What I found was a consumer affairs website with hundreds of complaints and comments about various Nabisco crackers including the Honey Made grahams.  Seems Nabisco has shifted making them to a plant and company in Mexico and people are filing complaints about the content, taste and some noted contamination examples in the products.  No one had realized they were buying anything different from the product(s) they had been used to when purchasing for years before and felt people should be made aware the products were not as they were and consumers depended on them to be.  Complaints included Premium saltines...which many of us had purchased for years, now crumbly, flaking off and tasting different... the Honey Maid grahams and Ritz crackers.  A number of consumers complained that the 'Ritz' they received smelled like motor oil and were inedible and smelled up their kitchen so tossed out immediately.  There were comments suggesting that was due to using rancid oil in making the Ritz.  All I know is my grahams were inferior, gave me a bad stomach ache i have had since yesterday and I called Amazon to complain feeling consumers should be given info the products are no longer the same and not from Nabisco in the US but now coming from Mendelez Int'; and made in Mexico.  I tossed the Honey Maid grahams and will never purchase any 'so called' Nabisco brand again ever.  Too bad but life is too short to mess with unknown edibles or odd tastes from what you felt secure with.  Not when buying in the US.  Also see links:  [...]and [...]	-1
The first thing I noticed was that three packs of crackers were packed loosely, crosswise, in a box designed to hold four perfectly, lengthwise. The second was the small size of the crackers, narrower and thinner than the Honey Maid graham crackers I used to love. The old ones were thicker, a bit soft, and very flavorful; these were like stiff cardboard, even thinner than saltines I'm sad to see another fine brand gone downhill, and I won't buy them again.	-1
not crazy for honey!	-1
Tastes great, whole crackers do not survive UPS shipments.  One whole cracker in the package and a couple of cups of graham cracker crumbs.	-1
Very disappointed in the weak flavor. i should stick with the blood orange which is delish.	-1
Can was leaking.  What a mess.  Also didn't much care for the drink. Will give rest of 6 pack to local free food pantry.	-1
I'm a big fan of San Pellegrino sparking fruit drinks, but these have a very weak flavor as compared to the others. The citrus flavors are there, but they are much more muted. This actually reminds me of the Nestle Pure Life Exotics or Perrier range of drinks. I would recommend their other flavors, Blood Orange especially, but not these.	-1
Tastes like dust	-1
Did not enjoy at all.	-1
Never saw this before - one of the cans was empty.  The can was completely sealed, but there was no liquid inside it!	-1
it has a bitter aftertaste	-1
1 can leaked.  What a mess.  Didn 't much care for the taste either.  Will give rest of 6 pack to local free food pantry.	-1
I love sparking water, and recently I've been trying new flavors so I thought I'd give this one a whirl.  It was too sweet for my liking, and you could hardly taste the water part of the water.  I really like the taste to accompany the water and not take over completely.  I'll be passing on these going forward.	-1
Dislike the taste.  Tossed 98% of the 1st can.  Will give rest of the 6 pack to local free food pantry.	-1
Taste great but they are also loaded with sugar. I wish they were using stevia instead or have a stevia option.	-1
eh, better than the grapefruit ones but still not great.	-1
I didn't realize it's a Nestle product which uses GMO and resists labeling them	-1
not awesome	-1
A lot of sugar with no taste.	-1
Pleased with purchase	-1
just gross.	-1
meh	-1
horrible and filled with bad ingredients.	-1
Taste legitimately like cardboard. Buy another brand	-1
We didn't like the taste of this product, too weirdly sweet.	-1
Maybe I got a bad box I have tried this brand before but not this type many times and it was fine This tasted like soap and perfume, waxy disgusting My husband would not eat it either and he is not picky whole thing went into the trash	-1
Not what I expected. More like bad cake.	-1
I probably suck at making brownies but these turned out pretty crappy. Semi dry, hard and just not that great tasting.	-1
Daughter liked these but not big on the candy.  Could of used low sodium salt instead	-1
Didn't like it that much	-1
Disappointed.  Set it out for Christmas and no one liked it because the peanuts were so bland from having no salt.	-1
It tasted stalel!	-1
Gift	-1
I would never buy these again/  They were spicy hot and not a good way.	-1
lime flavor was strong	-1
Maybe I have the wrong taste buds but these are heinous. I love chili. I love lime. I hate these.	-1
I was expecting great things for this product. But it's a big yuck.	-1
kinda wierd	-1
I enjoy chili and lime together but these taste horrible! I was very disappointed in the flavor of these peanuts. There wasn't alot of lime flavor and the chili seasoning was way too over powering. They left much to be desired.	-1
Not one of my favorite Nut-rition blends.  Too many of those little crunchy granola thingies and very few of the yogurt-covered raisins.  Will not buy again.	-1
I always crave salty, crunchy snacks with a little kick to them, so I thought that these would be perfect. Unfortunately, they were a disappointment. I like the chili lime flavor- the citrus and spice are a great combo and very well balanced, but it was the texture that I didn't care for. Instead of being crunchy, they're rather soft, almost like they're boiled rather than roasted.  Instead of devouring these within a day, as I usually do, they've been sitting in my kitchen cabinet for a few months.	-1
I thought these were too sweet.	-1
Can is deceptive. It is tiny folks!	-1
these were MUCH spicier than I imagined!!!!	-1
These peanuts are simply not good. I can't describe the taste with words. They are definitely more lime than chili and they taste very artificial.  It was a nice idea to have different flavors to nuts but I think they should just stick with the basics.	-1
I bought these thinking they might me like "Golden Nuts" I had tried in Mexico. They weren't anything like those and were just nasty in my opinion.	-1
Almost tasteless	-1
Definitely not a fan of this flavor on the peanuts. They are edible but I wouldn't buy them again. Oddly. I adore the chili lime almonds, so it must be something with the peanuts.	-1
Bought once and will not buy again as they taste bland.	-1
too salty ..not sure where they found sea salt so rediulously strong and just not great.  Dont waste your money.	-1
Gag me, with a spoon.	-1
They need more vinegar much more, because all I tasted was salt.  They are good for salty nuts.	-1
Couldn't taste the Carmel just taste like some sugar covered nuts	-1
We recently tried three varieties of the Planters peanuts in a can and this was by far the worst of the three.  Having a cocoa coating that remains on the fingers like the fake orange colored stuff on cheesy snack foods, it is not even worthy of licking off.  This is the only can we could not even finish and the cans are very small.  We washed off the coating and still did not care for them.	-1
Blech, Chocolate tastes fake and it was not good. I will literally eat almost anything chocolate but I tossed these. I never throw food away so that's how much I disliked it.	-1
Overwhelming artificial taste - the question is why? Take peanuts, add brown sugar, caramelize, sprinkle on some sea salt, then pack. Not a difficult process, or at least it shouldn't be. Planters failed at the task.	-1
Not very tasty	-1
First, I like/crave salt & vinegar items in potato chips and Pik-Nik's, however, I'm not crazy about these peanuts.  But, I normally prefer cashews to peanuts...so, could just be me.	-1
Didn't care for these at all. They didn't taste like chocolate, kind of bitter rather than sweet. I think they just rolled them in unsweetened cocoa powder, why - I couldn't tell you.	-1
Not ad big as expected	-1
Sorry, I don't like the caramel flavoring	-1
Uh-oh - saw these peanuts contain cottonseed oil. Hadn't seen that on a list of healthy oils, so thought I'd better research it. Here's what Dr. Weill says when asked if cottonseed oil is okay?  Definitely not. As a matter of fact, in my book, Eight Weeks to Optimum Health, one of the first things I ask readers to do is to go through their pantry shelves and throw out anything made with cottonseed oil. I regard it as unhealthy because it is too high in saturated fat and too low in monounsaturated fat. What's more, cottonseed oil may contain natural toxins and probably has unacceptably high levels of pesticide residues (cotton is not classified as a food crop, and farmers use many agrichemicals when growing it). Be on the lookout for cottonseed oil in packaged foods and avoid products that contain it. Manufacturers like it because it's cheap, and products that say "may contain one or more of these oils" and list cottonseed, will almost certainly contain it.  In one oz. of these peanuts is 7g of protein, 22% of your fat, and 170 calories. Probably best to not eat and find healthier nuts without the cottonseed oil.	-1
Taste ok. Nothing to brag about.  200% over priced. Will not buy again on Amazon. Many vendors take advantage.	-1
Not a good flavor, honey roasted is way better	-1
It's the taste that gets a 1 star. I love salt and vinegar chips so I thought these would be worth a try. But the taste of the peanuts and the salt and vinegar flavoring just didn't do it for me..	-1
Kind of bland, not enough vinegar flavor	-1
has much more sugar than its written on a can, there were like 2 table spoons of sugar/cocoa powder mix on the bottom, never buy them again	-1
I love peanuts and I love salted caramel. These just don't taste good at all.	-1
Do yourself a favor and just buy the honey roasted peanuts. These aren't as good.	-1
Not good at all, waste of money	-1
Once you get past the added flavor, it is just peanuts left.  Flavor goes fast, so it really doesn't taste right.  I like sea salt and vinegar, just not on peanuts - obviously.	-1
Did not taste the chocolate at all.	-1
Just kind of tasted like peanuts, didn't really taste the cocoa. I'm not sure what I was expecting these to taste like but whatever it was these didn't taste like it. I'll stick to regular peanuts.	-1
Old, rank and hard	-1
Nasty tasting artificial caramel flavor.	-1
These were not as good as I expected they'd be for the hot tooth in the family. As I purchased them for a son who loves hot stuff.  I interviewed him on what he thought, his response was, "Nasty" he could not eat them. It's to bad.  Because I thought they'd be a nice snack.  Some folks might like them.  The price is not bad on them, so I'd say it is probably a taste preference situation.  If you've never had them, you still may want to try them.  As for the nuts my son did not want.  They did not go to waste.  I crushed them and put them in a crust of a Mexican pie I made.  That worked.  So, yeah, they may not be great right out of the can into your mouth, but they can work crushed fine and used in crust for pizza or just a Mexican pie as I made. Thank you and I hope this reviewed help someone. Have a great day.	-1
It sounded like a good idea but when I got him they were horrible don't get up unless you really love the vinegar but it does not go well with peanuts	-1
So you are probably asking yourself "salt and vinegar peanuts, that seems odd" and you would be right the flavor is just not good with peanuts.  I love salt and vinegar, just not on peanuts.  Won't be buying this one again.	-1
Hey, Kraft,  I don't know what you did wrong this time, but usually I like Sea Salt and ?!? Chips, and I have often enjoyed Vinegar (Pickle) flavored Chips. But Sea Salt & Vinegar peanuts, with both flavors, is a total turn off. I don't remember when I opened the can, but I still have not finished it. (I'm one of those people who hate to throw food out, but I may make an exception here.  If you do like this flavor, or if you do not like this flavor, why don't you leave a comment here, so other people can get get an idea of how many people here like it, or don't. (Note: Yes and No are reversed here.)	-1
didn't really like this it was too sweet to enjoy	-1
I buy these Planters seasoned varieties to give my Chex Mix an extra kick, but these Chipotle peanuts were a disappointment. The main flavor I get is just generic smokiness, not chipotle or any kind of hot pepper. There was also a lot of seasoning powder at the bottom of the can, no loss really, more of the same generic smoke flavor I doubt would improve these nuts much.  On the off chance do you like these peanuts, be aware that this is a very small can (fits in the palm of my hand) and not enough to fill a bowl for poker night or entertaining.	-1
These peanuts lacked flavor. I was expecting them to be really spicy but they weren't at all! In fact, you couldn't even taste the seasonings. It was like eating regular peanuts. I was not impressed.	-1
I was expecting a honey-roast peanut with a caramel twist but it's just not what I was getting.  These weren't really to my liking so I ended up putting them out in a bowl at our tailgate parties and even then they hardly get touched.  I guess it's not just my taste that these peanuts aren't hitting.  I'll look for more flavors that might be more in line with what we were looking for.	-1
Don't care for the flavor, not a noticeable salted caramel flavor, rather disappointing, and the cost is a little high too.	-1
artificial taste.	-1
These didn't have as much flavor as I would've liked - I wouldn't buy them again.	-1
Not as good as other flavors	-1
One doesn't expect something labeled as salted caramel to have cinnamon in it. They tasted good, until I needed allergy medication to help with my swelling.	-1
Chipotle what? Not hardly, only after a couple handfuls! These are mostly salty, it even says so right on the nutrition label! I won't buy these again.	-1
aaaa	-1
These are awful. They are WAY too sweet. They taste very artificial. I like sweet stuff, but this is just absurd.  When I think of salted caramel, I think of a rich chocolate, not too sweet, with a hint of salt and a little bit of Caramel. These nuts taste nothing like that.  Planters, I love your honey roasted peanuts and your plain nuts too. These salted caramel nuts are just gross. Same old peanuts, which is why they got two stars, but ruined by a horrible artificial coating.	-1
its whatever. doesn't match my pellets.	-1
I expected these to be good, but they tasted very synthetic and fake.  I'll deal with a few more calories per serving if I'm eating real food.  When I eat peanuts I expect to be eating mostly real food.  It's unfortunate because this would be a good flavor of peanut if done right.	-1
Quality is not what it was MOSTLY,  purchased 3/16 exp 11/16 ??	-1
I took a chance on this item in my Prime Pantry box. I figured, I love peanuts and salted caramel, how can I go wrong? I miscalculated badly. There is a plastic, not quite caramel after burn to these that I find really unpleasant. Also, I immediately tasted the cinnamon. I don't like cinnamon and would never have bought these had I known that was an ingredient. Not sure why you need cinnamon in a product that is billed as salted caramel.  I'd never buy these again. If they are reading, I hope the people at the Kraft Heinz food lab realize that even if you can cook it up in a lab, fake=fake.	-1
The can was so tiny.	-1
The salted caramel flavor made the peanuts taste odd. Wasn't a big fan. Definitely didn't taste like salted caramel.	-1
THe original don't have much taste to them, plus they hurt so bad just to eat....  blech.	-1
Uh-oh - saw these peanuts contain cottonseed oil. Hadn't seen that on a list of healthy oils, so thought I'd better research it. Here's what Dr. Weill says when asked if cottonseed oil is okay?

I like Honey Roasted Peanuts and I like Salted Caramel Chocolates, so this new flavor seemed like a good idea---but no! Caramel and peanuts are a good combo in candy bars, but not as a standalone snack. In fact, these peanuts might be best put to use as part of a bigger recipe: trail mix, cookies, fudge, etc. Maybe they're good for dieters, since you won't feel like eating more than a couple!	-1
This might have just been a bad batch, but the oil had separated from the nuts which left an oily puddle on the bottom of the container.  Very unappealing.	-1
Doesn't remind me of salted Carmel. A little weird. I'd rather have their honey roasted.	-1
Blech!  The peanuts tasted yucky.  Gave it a try, and now I know.  The concept sounds delicious, but reality = eck!  :(	-1
Disappointed is the correct word,  Usually Planter's Peanuts are good, but these were tasteless.	-1
Turns out I'm allergic to something in the product.	-1
do not care for these	-1
Very small can. They do not taste good either. Don't bother.	-1
These did not go over so well.  The caramel flavor just didn't hit the mark of making you want more.	-1
Hmmm...how could salted caramel peanuts not be good? I actually threw around a third of them away. I just didn't want to eat another one. It seems like this is a flavor that you could use natural ingredients for, but it's artificially flavored and really tastes like it.	-1
did nit care for this, no one at my house did, something strange about the caramel flavoring.	-1
Yuck. That is all.	-1
sicky sweet, artificial trash masquerading as healthy. Don't bother if you truly  care what you put inside your body.	-1
too small	-1
Very small can, smaller than it appears on the information page.  I will not be ordering this again, the size does not justify the cost.	-1
Kinda tastes like dirt.	-1
taste like saw dust	-1
Disgusting	-1
not fesh	-1
Not quite as I expected in the taste. Bitter.	-1
The first ingredient is sugar and it has a lot of artificial stuff. I threw it away. It is very unhealthy. It does taste good but the sugar and the artificial ingredients give it a one star.	-1
I was super excited to find this budget-friendly ingredient for duty-baking for people I hate (gossipy co-workers and so on). They don't care about their health, so it was really annoying having to waste a jar of proper almond butter to make raw truffles that they didn't appreciate as being healthier. Now I can bake utter crap for the office shindig and be less of a target for scorn from my chemical-loving coworkers. "These are made with almond butter so they fit with my diet" om nom nom slurp guzzle "ya I can eat stuff like this" mmmmm "I lost 1lb so I can have a cheat day"   Jif Almond butter is a must-buy storecupboard essential for anyone with the palate of a hfcs-addicted 5 year old. A whimsical treat, best enjoyed with HFCS artificial fruit spreads, and washed down by a finest vintage Mountain Dew.  Also has a load of extra ingredients, much more so than regular almond butter. Why have just almonds when you can get so much extra for your $$? Enjoy the playful hint of SUGAR- everyone's favourite natural buzz! Marvel at the smoothness the hydrogenated vegetable fats lend to the nasty horrid plain almonds. Euw yuck, almonds as nature intended? NO THANKS- let's have JIF!	-1
the dough came out kind of tough to eat....	-1
Smells like detergent	-1
I really like really sudsy, soapy body was and this just does not lather like I want it too.  Will not purchase again	-1
I wish I knew before I bought this that is is an exfoliation also. I only use it once a week as it leaves my skin a little too dry. Smells great though	-1
Ok sent not strong enough for my liking.	-1
Made my hair greasy, but was still frizzy in spots.  I won't buy it again.	-1
St Ives has discontinued a lot of the scents I used to love. I've been trying their new scents, but haven't had much luck. This is too perfumey. I don't smell any coconut at all. In fact, all I can really smell is the scent of artificial orchid, which is horrible. The body wash, as with all St Ives products I've used, does feel great on my skin; I just can't get past the smell on this one and the fact that the scent lingers on my skin all day long. I miss their citrus scent that I had been using for over 10 years, which was suddenly discontinued.	-1
I can't get over the smell...it smells like sour milk or rot of some sort. It's such a shame, I usually like St. Ives products. I'll never buy this one again! *Purchased for personal use*	-1
I tried this product because my preferred St. Ives Body Wash (Purifying Sea Salt) was unavailable for awhile. This Coconut and Orchid body wash has an overly sweet scent, and lacks the exfoliating properties of the sea salt version. It's fine as far as being a basic body wash, but other than that, has no extraordinary qualities. I didn't feel especially silky, as the product name describes, but I also didn't feel any soapy residue.	-1
Bottle breaks very easily	-1
Its like vasaline in a tube. Ugh! And it is sticky.	-1
When I received it the entire contents were all in the box.  The lid was off.  So I couldn't use it.	-1
Doesn't really do much. I guess you get what you pay for.	-1
Works only a little bit.  Too greasy.	-1
Not for all skin types! I don't think this product is bad, but it just doesn't go well on my skin. I actually saw a blogger recommend this product. And it has good reviews, so I bought this one for daily clean (I don't wear makeup but am concerned about the sunscreen I use). I tried this for several times, my face hurts when I am using it. Doesn't really cause allergy nor rash, but my face turns red afterward. And the pain is so bad, I couldn't massage for longer on my face. Just be careful if you have sensitive skin like me.	-1
I know it's Neutrogena, but this made me break out in tiny bumps all over. Sadly, it was the only sunscreen I brought with me to Italy, and suffered sunburn because I couldn't wear it. Not great, Neutrogena. I am so disappointed.	-1
This product did not work for me: it clogs the skin pores and therefore can cause inflammation instead of controlling it.	-1
I do not like this shampoo or the matching conditioner at all.  My hair doesn't feel clean even after two washes with it.  It leaves my hair dull and lifeless unlike my previous shampoo to which I will return.	-1
I am a bit disappointed in this shampoo. It takes way more of this shampoo than the Dove shampoo I was using before to properly clean my long hair. I don't see any "renewal" on the part of this product and am really disappointed in it. I have had pretty good luck with Aveeno products before but not this particular product or the companion conditioner. I will not purchase again.	-1
Smell was overwhelming, didn't work very well as far as taking care of dry skin.	-1
do not like it. leaves my hair greasy and a little oily. Must be for super dry hair. My hair is categorized as normal	-1
ok	-1
I like what's inside. Yet EVERY AVEENO pump product I've bought the pumps don't work. Aveeno won't give me credit or coupons. & it's expensive. The pump sticks each time you use it.	-1
Didn't like this product at all.	-1
I am a bit disappointed in this conditioner. It takes way more of this conditioner than the Dove conditioner I was using before to condition my long hair. I don't see any "renewal" on the part of this product and am really disappointed in it. I have had pretty good luck with Aveeno products before but not this particular product or the companion shampoo. I will not purchase again.	-1
This scrub is too coarse and can clog skin pores and cause inflammation.	-1
This stuff is horrible! Made my acne way worse right away... even turned zits into huge BOILS that got worse every time I applied it. Tried clean and clear persa-10 gel and the boils and new zits are 50% gone after 1 use before bed last night.	-1
Unfortunately, this didn't work for me.  I've found more success developing a routine and changing my diet. When I have a blemish come up, I just try to tweak the products I use now or eat less sugar.	-1
Doesn't do anything for my acne, seemed to flare it up even more honestly	-1
Not very impressed with this. It didn't seem to work even as well as regular cheap shampoo.	-1
to much sugar	-1
Black Cherry flavor is overpowering.	-1
SOUR!!!!! Whew! My family did not enjoy this	-1
Just a very weird taste to it. Hard to describe, kind of a chemical taste and the after taste stays with you for days. Drank less than 4 ounces and had to put it aside. my kids won't drink it either. Will ultimately go in trash!	-1
This has got to be the most disgusting tasting fruit drink I have ever run across. Nobody liked it.	-1
I accidently ordered this instead of orange. Gross. Has a super funky after taste.	-1
Nasty.  Way too sweet. Would not buy again.	-1
Country time uses to much sugar to taste good	-1
Doesn't really make the water taste like the typical sweet and tart pink lemonade that you would get from a soda fountain. Takes much more powder to make it taste okay than stated. Disclamer: I am a Kool-Aid person so if you are into crystal light or something you might like this.	-1
Hated this. Not sweet enough for a lemonade or a tea. Very bitter tasting.	-1
YUK!	-1
Tang doesn't do fruit punch well at all.	-1
funny taste	-1
I generally like Crystal Light but this flavor left a horrible aftertaste. It also gave me heartburn. I bought 2 packs and donated the 2nd one to Goodwill. Yuck yuck yuck. I will stick with strawberry kiwi or concord grape	-1
Taste is fine but if you're going low carb watch out for stalls with this stuff.	-1
Is it just me or does this mix actually make you more thirsty?  Its got a salty taste to it.	-1
Made my teeth hurt from being too sweet. Had to chuck it.	-1
The most god awful coffee i have ever tasted...it even smells strange.  What a waste of money!	-1
In my opinion, this is really strong and bitter.	-1
I was not a fan of this blend of coffee. I thought I would give it a try because the McCaf Hazelnut is so amazing, but sadly this coffee was not very aromatic, had a pretty bitter flavor and was not very enjoyable. We tried it in the office and not many people had favorable things to say, unlike the Hazelnut which smells amazing and everyone raves about!	-1
I didn't mean to order Decaf.	-1
I'm highly disappointed with this Maxwell House instant coffee. This was my first experience with instant coffee, and because of it I know I will not be returning to instant coffee anytime soon. I am a regular coffee drinker, I prefer espresso-based drinks like cappuccinos, but often drink lattes as well. I was expecting this to resemble a vanilla latte in flavor if not consistency.  This instant coffee tastes like if you put a tiny bit of vanilla creamer into water, heated it up, and then smoked it somehow. Like it has a weird smoky flavor I can't explain. I did not get any coffee flavor at all from this instant coffee (no matter how much powder I put in), and instead got a weird smoky-vanilla water. It was gross - I'm cringing just thinking about it.  Don't buy this. Take the time to go out and buy a real coffee or just use Keurig or something. Anything but this.	-1
Too many chemicals.	-1
I didn't like the taste. I'm more of a expresso type person. Strong and not to sweet.	-1
I bought this after loving the daytime clean & clear version thinking this would be a wonderful evening alternative but I couldn't be more wrong.  This has a VERY strong perfume smell that is an instant turn-off and gives me an instant headache just like so many perfumes do (and the reason I am not a perfume wearer).  I remember growing up having to endure my mom's Channel #5 and my dad's Polo and this just brought back those haunting memories.  I guess if you don't have sensitivities to perfumes you'll be fine but for me this is a big NO.	-1
Bought this as a back up since the product I normally buy was out of stock and did not like it as much,  just ok.	-1
Not strong enough for my taste - as I like my coffee pretty strong.  It's difficult to find strong flavored, yet decaffeinated coffee...	-1
Nothing like the caffinated version, not good.	-1
Too acidic, worse flavor. I prefer New England brand: smooth, strong enough for my taste.	-1
This is possibly the worst coffee I have ever tasted. I made the mistake of buying several bags of it elsewhere because it was on clearance. Now I know why. Then my husband bought some at another store, and it was just as bad. (So I know it wasn't just a bad lot.) This coffee is extremely acidic, with a side of bitter. It has very little of the normal body that coffee usually has. Without cream and sugar to cover up the taste, it's unbearable.	-1
ok in a pinch	-1
wife told me it was very bitter	-1
My husband won't eat anything from McDonalds, but he does like the McCafe regular coffee and will choose it over Starbucks often. I bought these K-Cups expecting a similar taste at home. Not so much. He was bitterly disappointed....or weakly disappointed might be more accurate. Even reducing the water amount and increasing the total cup to use 2 pods, he.still says these are just weak and bland. The Maxwell House Breakfast blend k-cups will be back on our counter from now on.	-1
I missed having a instant coffee option. As I can no longer find Sanka. I decided to try Maxwell House because my mother likes the caffeinated instant coffee.  Upon opening it, I smelled a burnt coffee smell. This was discouraging but I hoped  it would taste better. Sadly it didn't no matter how I tried to fix it. It reminded me of the coffee at the auto shop when I was young. Strong, bitter and, burnt. A taste you don't soon forget.  I ended up giving it away. I would not recommend to anyone who is looking for a smooth rich cup of coffee.	-1
Nasty and bitter. It should be free. Worse than tire shop coffee.	-1
After reading some of the reviews on here, I bought this to use it as a fill for creamer while adding extra flavor, but it hardly adds any flavor at all. In fact, it makes the coffee taste infinitely worse in my opinion. Threw it out.	-1
Very sweet ,serving is 6-8 teaspoons per 4-6 ounce cup. I wouldn't buy this again..	-1
Incredibly bitter!	-1
tossed this had a bitter aftertaste	-1
will not buy again	-1
yuck, I really hate everything Mcdonalds, don't even now why I bought this, just to throw it away.	-1
This coffee is terrible.  It has a very chemical smell to it and the taste is just awful.  Unfortunately we just through it out.	-1
The taste of coffee made from particular cups is weak and acidic, just awful.	-1
I've been trying this out for a few weeks, but I can't tell a difference from just using a normal bar of soap. It get's my face clean, but I get just as many pimples as before.	-1
Very very  strong and bitter tasting.  I am not one that likes strong coffee.  To be this bordered on tasting like an espresso...	-1
really weak when made as recommended, and not much better with an increased dose. this is just not very good. and its a very small container, its claim of 17 servings is kind of a joke. keep looking, c'est  merde!	-1
Does not taste good at all.	-1
Think this was a waste of money, but no one to blame but myself. Was not impressed. They seemed to change something from what I remembered, and that made the difference. You have to use so much to get a decent cup of coffee.	-1
It is almost impossible to wash my mouth because it has 21% alcohol in it. It also says " not for retail sale" on the back. I do not mind a strong cleaner of course, but it does really hurt. you can just get drunk by just drinking it I am sure :)	-1
Not the best cake, good texture but not much flavor.  Also,  too many ingredients need to be added including four eggs.  Not recommended.	-1
Not a fan. VERY strong synthetic garlic flavor is neither pleasant nor appetizing. Will not buy this again.	-1
Contains wheat pasta. Not expected in pilaf	-1
Gross. Just no. No, no, no. It tasted rancid. Won't buy again.	-1
Has tbhq or bht preservative	-1
Tastes too salty and chemically -- like microwave popcorn	-1
not crazy about it	-1
Nice texture and decent flavor (if not a bit fake berry tasting) but this granola bar is simply WAY TOO SWEET. So sweet it makes your teeth ache. Stick to other varieties and leave this one on the shelf.	-1
Spilled all over in the package.  Sad.	-1
Was under the impression this was a full box. It was only one bowl.  Misleading description/picture. Will not order again.	-1
2 of the bars were open in the box. Not sure if it was caused from shipping or a malfunction at the plant.	-1
It was mushier and less tasty then either the local store brand of a similar type (slightly different flavor) that is a similar price and vastly inferior to Umpqua Oats, which admittedly costs more.	-1
Tastes good, but this product has MSG! Yuck!	-1
small portions and un-flavourful	-1
We're stale.	-1
YUCK!  It's like eating mush.  No oat texture to this product at all.  Would rather wait the time to cook regular steel cut oats.	-1
If you're looking for oatmeal with a bit of a bite to it texture-wise, quaker old-fashioned oats (that you cook for 7-8 minutes) is way better.  The texture of this is gummy and kinda awful.	-1
Quaker Oatmeal Squares, Cinnamon, Breakfast Cereal, 14.5 oz. (411g) Box, by Quaker Cereal. It is difficult to get very excited about this rather bland cereal, even with a little cinnamon to give it some taste.  It is too sweet, it is very chewy and slow to eat, and it is medium-high in salt content (190mg). Salt (Sodium) is not good for anyone with high blood pressure, or anyone trying to control fluid retention. I emptied the rest of the box into my birdfeed barrel.  Mixed in with the regular birdfeed, the birds and squirrels did not complain, and the food did not go to waste. I could only give this Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cinnamon Breakfast Cereal two Amazon stars.

Not that great. I have been looking for the Oatmeal Squares that were in a snack mix, and were really good but this isn't them. Birds will get the rest.	-1
Unfortunately this item arrived damaged and opened thus I would not risk eating an opened item. However, i have purchased this product elsewhere and it is great.	-1
I had a reaction to the Steel Cut Oats.  I have  Gluten issues.  I never noticed that it was not gluten free.	-1
Didn't like the taste. I won't buy this again and I like cheese but not fake tasting cheese.	-1
I bought several thinking itd be easy to make. Wrong! I could not get the rice soft no matter how many ways or time I tried in the micro! The rice always cane out hard & crunchy so I can only assume the product is old.	-1
Way too sweet.  Will look to see if a low sugar option is available.	-1
Awful. Doesn't taste like the box version at all. Tried adding to it but never could get more than 3 bites down.	-1
What. A. Mess. I recommend making this in a much larger container because this little bowl overflows all over the microwave!	-1
These are GROSS it is like eating gritty water with some kind of powder sauce .  ICK to the nth degree	-1
Looks like grits ... tasted awful	-1
The Cheese version is horrible. Each of the four flavors feels faker than the last. The original one feels a little more natural. The convenience of having 'instantaneous' grits is really good, they just taste horrible.	-1
I did not enjoy these at all! In fact, I ended up tossing the rest of the box away. The cheese flavoring just made it taste very blah to me! I might try more Quaker Instant GRITS, but it won't be the cheese lover types! Maybe buttered might be nicer? Anyway....incredibly unhappy with this product.	-1
DO NOT follow the directions. They are wrong, period. Instructions say to mix seasoning with water (to fill line) and place in microwave for 3 minutes. This results in a boiled over mess EVERY time! I've tried less water, no mix, one-minute segments... same result everytime, a cup full of sludge and microwave to clean up. If you cook for a minute, stir and another minute or so it seems sufficient but I will not be ordering these again.	-1
These may have tasted fine but the packaging does not hold up well to shipping at all...	-1
These are awful.  Purchased as a quick meal option for busy season at work, I ended up disappointed every time I attempted to make one of these.  Every single cup ended up with me eating sludgy rice and cleaning out the office microwave. I tried using less water, colder water, less time in the microwave... I even tried using different microwaves and adjusting the power settings.  It appears the cooking directions are wrong, it has to be because every single cup spilled all over the place.  Just to prove it wasn't an issue with me, I asked someone else to make it for me one day with the same results.  I can make Easy Mac and any other kind of microwaveable food out there.... except for these Rice A Roni cups.  I'd like to tell you they at least tasted good, but I wouldn't really know because the flavoring went all over the place when they overflowed in the microwave every time.  So unimpressed and I definitely won't be buying these again.	-1
A convenience food, this instant grits cheese lovers variety is fast and easy comfort food, but the chemical additives, artificial colors and flavors and crazy high sodium level are hard to ignore. I try to avoid monosodium glutamate and failed to notice its inclusion in two of the varieties.  Even if ignoring the ingredient list, the primary flavor is salt. The product is simply too salty. The sodium level in one small packet of any of the three flavors is high  420, 460 or 480 mg  approximately 20 percent of the daily value.  Preparation is easy. Cooking a minute or a minute and fifteen seconds in a microwave with one-half cup water or milk. I tried it with both liquids and the difference in taste and texture was not significant.  I understand snack food having high levels of sodium and including lots of chemical additives, but it just seems a natural grain product should avoid these inclusions as much as possible. In the future I will stick to plain grits and control what is added into the bowl. The best if used before date on the package is four months in the future.	-1
Fake cheese flavor,	-1
wallpaper paste	-1
too sweet!	-1
Kind of rough will scratch your checks up....	-1
Horrible. I love life cereal. However, this is just nasty. No flavor. Stays very hard in milk. Tasted like cardboard. It really does.	-1
Meh...very artificial flavor, would not buy again.	-1
Box open	-1
Less sugar has weird taste that made it so I couldn't eat it. I could smell it and taste it for so long afterwards. :(	-1
I didn't check to see if this had artificial flavors or colors -- it unfortunately does. Seriously ? Oatmeal (from Quaker no less) -- pretty simple. Dried apples -- pretty simple. Why do they need to add artificial flavor. I've completely lost faith in the Quaker brand name. Even the Chex brand Maple flavor (natural) oatmeal is all natural. General Mills has announced that all of their cereals will be rid of artificial flavors and colors. Shameful for Quaker and with no heath benefits for consumers.	-1
Contained wheat pasta. Could not use. Didn't read the ingredients like I should because I didn't expect a product called pilaf would be like a rice a roni.	-1
As advertised	-1
This particular product is edible, but I would look for something else to eat. There are better choices. I will not buy the reduced sugar oatmeal again.	-1
Can you believe, I taste the difference and miss the sugar.  This may be better for me, but I won't be ordering this formulation again.  I ate all I'd ordered first, and when I need a break, any granola bar beats a cookie.	-1
Not like they used to be at all.	-1
It was good.	-1
We LOVE the chicken flavor....normally.  I naturally didn't expect the flavor to be compromised with the lower sodium but unfortunately it was.  This just doesnt have the full flavor you know and expect from rice a roni products.  Perhaps if I had never tasted the full chicken version...this would taste great but it's not a flavor I would reorder.  Perhaps you may have better luck and it may fir your fancy but this lower sodium option wasn't a flavor we enjoyed	-1
Discovered that quinoa is nasty!	-1
It was ok but nothing exuberant	-1
Got this during lighting deal. Salty and not much flavor beyond that. Disappointed.	-1
After I made this I felt like I was eating over cooked ramen noodles.  I'm not impressed.  I'd rather make regular pasta in boiling water and just add a jar of sauce.	-1
the taste was to strong. I love the middle east one and the pine nut one	-1
The flavor is good, but it has a weird, disturbing texture.  I won't buy it again, and I'll donate the rest of the box to our local food shelf, just so it won't go to waste.	-1
The 3 packets with correct amounts of sugar/banana were quite tasty with a light banana flavor and enough nuts for most bites to have a bit of crunch (although the nut flavor didn't come through much).  The other 3 had little to no banana and no sugar at all.  The 3 packets which were not properly proportioned tasted like a cardboard box, even after adding sugar to make them somewhat edible.  50/50 is not good enough so I'll not try this one again.  It's a shame Quaker stopped selling individual boxes of their Bananas and Cream Oatmeal variety long ago.  It's a better tasting product with more banana flavor but having to purchase a variety box containing the Peach and Strawberry flavors to get the Banana and the Blueberry packets becomes tiresome.	-1
Out of all of the Quaker oat meals, this is the worst one. Is has a pasty consistency, somewhat flavor less and I'm not sure what the 'nut' part really is.	-1
i was looking for something that i could have for breakfast every morning.  this just had No taste to it. I Love oatmeal raisin cookies but these don't even compare. i am disappointed.	-1
Gross, dry. Will not buy again.	-1
THE most disgusting oatmeal cookie I have ever had. ... and I have had more than my fair share share of oatmeal cookies, :). SMALL. I was truly surprised how small the cookie was. This size cookie belongs in a ten for a dollar package. There were ample pieces of chocolate chips, each about the size a large ant and absolutely tasteless. I am not positive they were really chocolate. The last cookie was the best, well, at least it was edible and larger.  HOWEVER, though the package for it is labeled "Oatmeal Chocolate Chip" it was actually oatmeal and nuts. Fortunately I am not allergic to nuts but I cannot help but think what might have happened if someone with allergies to nuts was eating one of those on the way to work while driving the car.  ... Probably would not happen since the fine print on the box states the cookies "MAY CONTAIN TRACES OF TREE NUTS" and anyone with allergies would/should avoid these.  Summary: AVOID. These so-called "Breakfast Cookies" are a total ripoff.	-1
I've been eating Quaker Instant Oatmeal all my life but this organic variety has a much different taste and texture I did not care for.	-1
Boxes were all crushed may end up throwing them away??????	-1
A bit to sweet for my personal taste. Wasn't quite as tasty as I thought they might be, but again it is a matter of personal taste.	-1
I don't like them neither does my hubby. They only taste good when I am starving.tgey are too sweet and kind of crumbly, dry texture. Not my favorite... i gave it two stars over one because when you are in super hurry, they will do the job	-1
I cannot believe the manufacturers of this "alfredo" made it so it's watery. It's supposed to be thick. And the flavor is ok. Nobody really took the time to formulate it.  Unconscionable and I'll never buy it again.	-1
This was total mush for us.  Did not care for it at all.  We're sure we used the right amount of liquid, but it was drowned. By the time we got the water cooked off, it was total mush.  Just not a pleasant experience.	-1
I thought I would give this a try. It was mushy and had the texture of wallpaper paste very shortly after getting it out of the pan. I would not buy this again. Ugh!	-1
Bland, could not taste any mushroom flavor.	-1
terrible flavor, worse than the regular.  It sort of taste like macaroni and cheese but there is some sort of weird flavor and it taste awful to me.  I will not purchase again.	-1
Tastes good, but there's hardly anything in the container. You get about as much as you do in those little instant packets, which are much cheaper. These are convenient, but a total waste of money.	-1
Too sweet gave it away	-1
I bought these a while back as emergency snacks and just recently opened one. Despite having a long shelf life, they tasted moldy and unappetizing. I don't know if I got unlucky with my package and it expired quicker than normal or this is just how they taste! Either way, cliff bars is the way to go.	-1
These are too spiced for me...too much cinnamon especially. I cant explain the texture but not "soft cookie". They're also individually wrapped for their own protection...I guess. I certainly will NOT purchase this product again! And the price here was way too much! Won't be buying any more products from Quaker. Their products haven't improved...and other companies produce similar/better ones...and they cost less!! I'll buy store brand instead of this anytime!	-1
It seems like these sat too long somewhere, they are on the stale tasting side	-1
Too much cinnamon for me.	-1
Not very good.	-1
These breakfast cookies are too sweet to eat ......sweeter than regular cookies almost.	-1
These taste funny. I'm happy I only bought a few. The sauce isn't like butter...if you've ever seen the movie Kate and Leopold, this is THAT kind of butter. Super fake and just "not right."  I was only able to make it edible by adding a heap of grated parmesan/romano. I won't be buying this particular flavor again. But the Parmesan one made by Pasta Roni is very delicious! Give that one a try!	-1
I wanted to like these, but they're not that great. The sauce tastes weird and varies with each cup: Some have no garlic taste while others have too  much fakey-garlic flavor. The pasta doesn't cook well and stays hard after three minutes, so it's best to cook  it for 4 and a half minutes. The sauce is really runny and it makes oily stains on tablecloths or clothes if it drips. It smells bad too! My house smelled like the sauce for a day before an open window and an air purifier cleared it out. What a shame.	-1
Yuk. Feed these to the pigeons. They might like it.	-1
This one I didn't care for. The taste was too artificial	-1
I like most of the other Near East products and normally I love broccoli and cheese flavored products.  However I really did not like this.  Not much of a cheese flavor and was really bland.	-1
Rice to Broccoli/Cheese ratio is very poor. Just not a lot flavor. Would prefer to buy the items separate for what you get,	-1
These are reminiscent of other oatmeal bars that quaker has made in the past.  The bars sit in a strange place as far as texture and consistency.  They are very dense and chewy but still have some crunchy oats and grains.  This is what I imagine it would taste like if a prepared packet of instant oatmeal was allowed to cool completely, had a dry packet of oatmeal added to it and mixed in, and was pressed into a bar.  The flavor is fine, it's just the texture that I'm not a fan of.	-1
Ugh - the overpowering fake banana flavoring and cloying sweetness make these inedible to me. Nutrition wise, we can do a lot better with Kashi bars or Kind bars.	-1
Hoping for a bit of sweetness but not this, could be added to plain oatmeal to temper sweetness low sugar but added sweetness yuch. Going back to stone cut Irish Oatmeal - was hoping for a quick tasty instant !! Why can't corporations make good simple foods. If this had larger portion of good oatmeal and less sweet it would meet my needs.	-1
We love Quaker Oats cereal but this Maple Sugar and Cinnamon is absolutely horrible tasting.  It may have only 4 grams of sugar instead of the 12 grams in the regular package but it isn't making it taste good.  I'd never purchase this again.  Sticking to my favorate apple and cinnamon.  Disappointed customer.  Expected a much more flavorful taste.	-1
just got my box today and it is all smashed up and open on all sides due to how mangled the box is	-1
You can definitely tell there is less sugar. It tastes nothing like the regular version. I won't be buying it again.	-1
Very dry and yucky	-1
Did not like this oatmeal too much.	-1
This was open and partially empty when I opened the box.	-1
I love the boxed pasta roni. These are terrible doesn't taste like the boxes at all. Has an odd off taste.	-1
A little too sweet for my taste -- but luckily there are a lot of oatmeal cups out there to choose from.	-1
This particular variety has an overwhelmingly strange taste. I'm not sure if it's an almond extract that is overpowering it or something else. Also, the amount of water that this requires leaves you with an oatmeal soup, of sorts, since the water isn't fully absorbed into the oats. Not a fan.	-1
I did not care for the flavor.  Reminded me of rice krispy treats.	-1
These PODS are horrible!! Ill stick with liquid	-1
I have a teenager who's allergic to a lot of things in soaps and cleaners so for most of his life we've been washing his clothes and rinsing them twice. We decided to try these and sure enough, he didn't have the reaction to it like he does other brands BUT they also don't get out body oil! Some of his t-shirts and things that had been washed in this were put away seasonally and I kid you not, when he took them out to wear them again they reeked to high heaven of rancid body oil--absolutely disgusting. Even supplementing with extra additives did not help.  Now if you use these for an additive, like throw a pod in in place of borax or washing soda, to another detergent they work out pretty well. On their own I suppose they're okay if a person basically doesn't actually do anything in the clothes they wear but around this house people tend to do things that result in real dirty clothes and these won't touch them.	-1
NO SCENT WHAT-SO EVER. NIG WASTE OF MONEY!	-1
Smells like peanuts, but the taste is very bland to the point of being tasteless. If anyone has any suggestions as to how to actually make it taste like peanut butter please comment, and I'll update my review if they work.	-1
I purchased these because they were out of the brands that I usually will gravitate to All free and All mighty Pac. I really didn't like this soap. For two reasons the clothes really didn't smell clean once they dried (out of the washer the smell was strong of detergent ) and I ended up washing them over. The second reason was my grandmother said her Eczema itches more with it. That &washing loads over again really was not worth the money it cost me. I would not recommend.	-1
Meh on the taste. I had to add fruit to the flakes to make them edible.	-1
I like the flavor and texture of the cereal. However, on the Nutrition Facts side of the box just above the Questions or Comments section is the statement: "Produced with Genetic Engineering." To that I say, "No thanks!" I won't buy this cereal anymore.	-1
Sometimes for use in moderation, at night...but not too good nutrition, lacks fiber, has sugar.	-1
Won't buy again.	-1
Doesn't hold edges in place as I thought it would.	-1
Our family didn't like them. Not chewy, hard to bite, super dry.	-1
Too much sugar!  11 grams is a lot of sugar for something so small.  Cascadian Farms should be ashamed.	-1
Absolutely disgusting!	-1
These are really grainy tasting -- like cardboard really.  Our family didn't enjoy and pitched most of them.	-1
Don't really like the taste. Will not buy again.	-1
