They are too dry and look unappetizing.	-1
The color is a tish offputting, but the flavor is unbeatable.	1
great	1
I got a bag of these in a recent Rawbox subscription box and I was excited to try them out.  I am already a fan of the dried plums from the same brand.  And, I am really happy with these.  I love the simplicity of the ingredients list -- apricots and nothing else.  No added sugar, no preservatives.  Because of this, these are brown in color and are a bit more reminiscent of raisins than the sulfured apricots would be.  That's just how it is with unsulfured dried fruit and I came to accept that long ago!  (They are a bit sticky due to the natural fruit sugars they contain.)  I usually cook with these instead of eating them plain.  They're quite good in North African-inspired stews and crockpot dishes with chickpeas and vegetables, served over couscous.  If they need to be chopped for a recipe, I use kitchen scissors (so much easier than a knife since they're sticky).  Anyway, I'm glad I got a chance to try these and if I need dried apricots again, I would definitely consider this brand.	1
Nope; ate 2, then one more.  Sent them back. Did not have good flavor. Not sure why? I read the reviews and I thought I would give them a try. Nope, nope, nope.	-1
wonderful flavor with none of that nasty sulfer under taste. They look kinda awful--almost black-you might have to just shut your eyes the first time you try them! I will buy them again when these are gone.	1
Good taste but I did not like the dull almost brown color.	1
great	1
This was really the best value for dried Apricots that I could find on Amazon, so it's a SUPER Buy.  They arrived fast, fresh, and well within the expiration date.  Will definitely order again!	1
Good	1
Delicious for eating out of the hand, or for adding to smoothies, cookies, etc. No added awful things to make it "look pretty."	1
Heavenly flavor and safe to eat - these days only organic is safe.	1
delicious, soft, tender and very tasty.	1
what can I say?  Same product as the store but better price!	1
These dried apricots are so delicious. As soon as I got them I made apricot chicken. They are sweet and I love the fact they are organic.	1
Thank you, God for making figs!	1
I love figs and delighted to be able to get organic!	1
Best figs I have ever eaten.  They were so moist and had an amazing flavor.  This is the second bag I have purchased and will buy more from this seller.	1
I am particularly fond of THESE figs...they are soft and chewy, and just delicious.  BUT, if you do buy the 40-ounce size and YOU are the only one that eats them, I would strongly suggest that you buy a smaller quantity at a time as they do tend to spoil after a couple of months.	1
I have no complaints with the seller on "made in nature organic dried apricots  " . the problem is the rubbery tasteless brown piece of yuck. I literally could not keep them down. I was looking for a good flavor but after the first one , I didn't want to throw bag away. I had to though.	-1
I read the other reviews and I don't know what happened with theirs but I really liked these. I ate the whole bag myself. They are organic and sulphur free so they are brown instead of that bright orange color you get with the ones in the store and they don't have any sourness either, which is nice. All in all I would totally buy again.	1
Now this is what dried fruit is supposed to be like.  I enjoy them a lot.  They are excellent consistency and taste great.	1
These are good figs.  I enjoy them and was not able to find this brand locally.  I was thrilled when I found them on Amazon and ordered a bag.  They are reasonably fresh, nicely dried and taste very good.	1
These are like eating gluten free fig newtons - great gluten free snack food!  Good price when you use subscribe and save!	1
These dried figs are labeled "organic." However, they are very soft. Dried figs are hard. These must have been sulfured to keep them soft. The last time (last week) I have two (2) figs, I got diarrhea within an hour. This is a fictional item.	-1
Works as expected...what can you say about Tahini.  The can is a convenient size and the lid is nice and tight.	1
The best!	1
The taste was okay but I could not get it to stay mixed well.	-1
A must-have for homemade hummus.	1
The quality of this brand is consistently high. The puree is thick and the sesame tastes as though it's toasted. I cannot be certain, but I have been using it for years (decades, actually) and it has never disappointed me.  You do need to put in a little effort to stir it right after you open the can (or if it's settled and separated), but that's true of any high quality tahini. Also, if you do not use the entire can, which you likely will not, you need to refrigerate it after opening. It will keep for about six weeks that way.  If you are new to tahini and are exploring the possibilities,you can make deserts with it, but I stick to using this as a sauce or in hummus or other meze. Most of my sauces are simple and straightforward: a puree of garlic, tahini, lemon juice, water and salt. Additional flavor possibilities are endless by adding one or more of cumin, za'atar, or adding some kick with harissa. Once you have made a sauce and flavored it, pour it over baked vegetables like cauliflower, butternut squash, zucchini or eggplant. Garnish with pine nuts and enjoy a wonderful meal. The same basic sauce with fresh cilantro and parsley will work beautifully with broiled or grilled fish.	1
I like Hummus, but I hate the cost in the grocery store.  So, I make my own.  I've tried various brands of Tahini, but the Joyva really has proven itself to be the best choice.  Other Tahini's don't seem to paste up as well as Joyva does (I start with 1/4 c. of Joyva, 1/4 c. of fresh squeezed lemon juice) recipes vary from there, but consistently I found the flavor and the product to really exceed my experiences with any other products.  5 Stars is a clear choice for me on this one.	1
highly recomend	1
I like the price point but hate how hard it is to mix this up. Separation is expected in such a product, but I end up having to drain the oil off into a mixing bowl and then prying out the sesame paste with a fork. I work it with a whisk for five minutes or so and then pour it back into the can. I have purchased other brands that reach just require a quick stir with a spoon right in the container.	-1
Glad to have been able to purchase sesame paste through Amazon. This tastes just fine and saved me the trouble of hunting for it at a store. The can was fresh with ample expiration deadline.	1
Quality as expected	1
Tastes great...Must blend after opening as the oil separates from the solids as expected with pure ground nuts!	1
did not like	-1
I'm sure this stuff has all sorts of interesting culinary uses, but I just like to eat it on crackers.  It has a very subtle flavor and an interesting aftertaste.  Also goes good with falafel in a pita with lettuce, tomato, and tabouli.  I'm not sure about the differences between brands.  I imagine the differences are minimal.  This is the brand I've always bought and I've never had any complaints.	1
Although I bought this accidentally thinking it was Halva (the containers are similar [as well as the ingredients) I have used this for salad dressing and dip (with some fixing up) and it is very tasty and healthy.	1
I guess this takes an acquired taste. I made some Tahini salmon last night and really thought it would taste like sesame, which I love. I tasted no sesame, just almost a very light peanut butter taste. It has 18 g of fat per 2 Tbs  so for those sensitive to a lot of fat this is not for you. I don't eat that much fat in 2 days. Way tasteless as far as I'm concerned. I added lemon to it and seasonings and couldn't taste anything but the gritty tahini. I guess it's just me. I don't like it at all.	-1
These are very good soups.  They don't taste salty.	1
Tasty and low salt. Remember there are two servings per can. Don't eat more than 1/2 can which equals one serving at a meal. It's easier on the system.  It's a shame that sugar is an additive in so many of the Amy's products. I am diabetic and added sugar means I have to eat less. No fun.	1
it was disgusting.	-1
This is great soup...  highly recommend/	1
I've had probably what is the best homemade Lentil Vegetable and while this isn't it...it's pretty good for coming out of a can.	1
I'm a big fan of Amy's soups and this one is no exception. Great served as directed and even better with a few herb added	1
This is my favorite soupreally good flavor and texture.	1
Another great soup from Amy.	1
Love lentils. Not as good as home made but close enough when I am short of time but in the mood	1
Good soup..	1
Very delicious!	1
delicious!	1
Rich and delicious taste! Enough veges to add another good layer, but still taste like a lentil soup should. Satisfyingly good!	1
Great on a hot or cold day!!  Delicious and filling.	1
Love Amy's soups! This is another one of the lovely lentil soups from Amy's. We love these soups to have on hand for quick and easy meals or lunches. With a small farm and homeschooling and being busy sometimes you just need something easy to eat and these really hit the spot. Delicious without any of the additives of other traditional canned soups. It is very filling on it's own but can easily be a side or with a grilled sandwich. I love that they are available through pantry so I can stock up on staples without having to go into town.	1
Very tasty soup.  Will buy this item again.	1
great	1
....almost as good as home-made!	1
Tasty and just enough serving for two.	1
Very good tasty soup.	1
Delicious! Anything I can buy organic is a plus so I was very happy with this product.	1
Nice!	1
Ok, I have to say, the packaging did draw me in... I mean, how could the little hippy bunny flashing you a peace sign steer you wrong?  So I picked up the box...organic, I like that, 8 grams of sugar, I can live with that, no trans or saturated fats, 20% calcium, 2 grams of fiber, and I can have 28 little cookies (a combo of chocolate, honey & chocolate chip) for 130 calories.  So, the bunnies and I went home together....  These are my favorite little cookies when I want something sweet but don't want to obliterate all the good eating that I did all day.  Yeah, they are a cookie, but I felt good that I could eat organic and that there were no additives or preservatives.  I like to keep mine in the fridge where they stay nice and cold and crunchy and just wait for me to pair it with a glass of milk.  Great snack for the little ones as well as those of us who are young at heart!	1
choco bunny	1
Delicious snack that taste great!	1
So yummy!!!	1
yum.. a really nice chocolate taste.	1
I love that these are organic, and my children love that they are chocolate.	1
Great healthy snack!	1
Annie's!!!	1
My daughter loves these, and so do I - they taste just like Teddy Grahams, but they're organic and all-natural.	1
Yum.  It took me two days to eat the whole box.  Should have bought two.	1
These are crisp, delicious, and chocolate,  Who could ask for more?  Pretty much the ultimate chocolate graham cracker cookie.  Pepperidge Farm used to make excellent graham cracker goldfish cookies that were quite good ("Mr. Truthteller remembers . . ."), but they were not as good as these.	1
Tasty chocolate Grahams.  YUM yum yum.	1
We enoyed these but not as much as the honey grahams.  The chocolate flavor is off a bit or not deep enough.	1
These are such a great snack to munch on. I used to get teddy grahams but they made me sick with how much sugar was in them. These are a more tasty, healthy alternative.	1
These were OK. Flavor and sweetness level was good. They are chocolate and have chocolate chips in some of them.  However I found them to be hard and kind of dense. Like the dough doesn't rise at all during baking. Teeny tiny chocolate flavored bricks. Hard to bite into. Doesn't easily soften in milk or your mouth. You really have to chew these. My 2 and 4 year old were excited about these at first but probably found them hard to eat because after a couple I found them spitting slimey crumbled up bunnies all over the floor. And they didn't want any more...ever. They would rather eat saltines than these.  I kept them a couple of weeks but the kids never wanted them so I threw them out. It's great they're organic but who cares when no one (not even me) wants to eat them.	-1
Both hubby and toddler loves them!	1
Delicious	1
Horrible odor, taste and aftertaste.	-1
Delicious! The box and packaging reminds me of cereal, but these are basically cookies.  The fact that it's organic and whole grain makes me feel a little better about eating so many. I shouldn't snack so much, but these were so good I couldn't help myself.	1
Delicious!	1
lol, I thought this was the cereal when I bought it. Everything Annie's is super high quality.	1
My son loves these.  I can't find them everywhere so it's cool I can get them here.	1
These choco bunnies are hard to resist. Open a box, it is very likely they won't las long. The taste is intensely chocolaty and goes very well with full fat milk.	1
I ordered these for the first time, and have to say; I am more pleased with them than I thought I would be.  I definitely plan to order again.	1
nothing special	-1
I guess the speed they went is a sign my family liked these.	1
so good taste like teddy grahams but so much healthier for you ... have bought several times since	1
These grahams have a good chocolate taste to cure those chocolate cravings. Such a nice little treat. Unlike the cheddar and honey grahams, these ones don't leave a film on your fingers.	1
My little granddaughters ask for it every time they get to visit.	1
as good as it gets for annnies!!! These are delicious and organic!	1
I love Annie's bunnies!  All the flavors are delicious!!!  Great for snacking and to grab and go.	1
nice grahams	1
thanks	1
We buy the individual packets for there lunches, or were buying them....BUT the chocolate ones were the favorites and a;ways gone first, while they "suffered" through the others so they said. This is much easier to portion out and waste less..	1
grandkids love these	1
Excellent snack for chocolate lovers.  Cute bunny shapes, too.	1
my kiddos cannot get enough!	1
These are our favorite Annie's snack! Perfect for a handful of sweet without too much sugar!	1
LOVE IT  Great Buy!	1
I bought these for my son but they were so good i ate most of the box. :/	1
First time eating these and it won't be the last! So yummy and healthy	1
Deliciousness!	1
I enjoyed these chocolate grahams. I like all graham crackers, but I prefer the regular ones.	1
Great!	1
Great tasting and I love that they are organic.	1
not good tasting, no chocolate flavor, hard as a rock (the size of a pebble too).	-1
delicious	1
Yummy. Wholesome ingredients and good taste too. The kids ate them up faster than I could restock. Annie's is a good name. I will buy this again.	1
Excellent snack and good for the Easter Basket!! The kids loved these!	1
I bought these bunny grahams through Amazon prime pantry. It was my first time doing it. I had a credit (which covered the shipping cost). The credit was from delaying one of my amazon prime deals, so instead of getting the item in 2 days, I opted to get it later and receive a credit instead!  My son loves them. I put them in his Easter basket. They are a healthier version of graham crackers, they are chocolate, and shaped like bunnies! I'm glad I can provide a healthier alternative snack that he enjoys.	1
Great quality graham cracker, my toddler son loves these as a small treat in the late morning and mid afternoon.  I still trust the Annie's brand even though they were acquired by General Mills, I know that has turned some people off to this brand -- though I haven't noticed any decline in the quality of the product that is packaged under the Annie's label.  Glad these are on Amazon Prime Pantry, and that these are competitively priced compared to the price at Whole Foods or my local grocery store.	1
My grandson loves it!	1
I bought it for my daughter but I have been eating them. They are so good!	1
These are my little's favorite! Healthier alternative to other snacks, that taste great!	1
Love them! They taste great!	1
Great food and family favorite.	1
Great chocolate flavor.  Wholesome ingredients.  Only complaint is that I ate them too fast....	1
The fruit snacks made by this company are good.  I also liked the cheese bunnies.  But, the grahams, 3 different types that I bought, all tasted weird and nobody in my house will eat them.  They are further a waste because I can't give chocolate to any of my pets so they had to go in the trash.  The taste reminded me of bad oil even though the product was not expired.  Maybe a bunch of batches were stored at too high temperature.  After trying 3 different types of grahams by this company, I can't say that I would want to taste one again.	-1
These are yummy! Kids love them and not as sugary as some snacks out there.	1
Delicious snack. Flavorful.	1
Very good	1
It's actually good! But my picky son won't eat it. :/	1
These were delicious!!!!! And the price even better	1
So yummy	1
Pretty good tasting snack.	1
didn' last a day at the house somebody liked them i didn't try myself .	1
I ordered this recently in my prime pantry and boy was I excited to try this. I ordered a bunch of organic stuff and this was one of them. I like to eat healthy and I chose that because eating healthy food makes me feel better. And the best part? It's chocolate :D My box clearly stated that best before 2016 so yeah I got plenty of time to enjoy this baby.  These bunny cracker are non-gmo and made with organic wheat. They are simple and plain but very delicious. You will not over eat these because they do not contain the harmful chemicals you find in mainstream cereal. I had about a handful maybe a dozen and I stopped because I felt full. Like I said you will not over eat on these guys. This cracker is very healthy for kids and adults. They are not overly sweet and just slightly so that you can actually taste the chocolate. I eat them with yogurt and they are PURFECT for tea time.  The ingredient list; Organic whole grain wheat flour, organic cane sugar, organic wheat flour, expeller-pressed sunflower oil, organic cane syrup, organic graham flour, cocoa, calcium carbonate, natural flavors (vanilla and chocolate), baking soda, sea salt, natural vitamin E. as you can SEE there is no corn syrup!!! Yey!	1
No flavor. Very bland	-1
These were lovely. Will buy again.	1
these are cute and good and i think they have less sugar than a lot of snack food. we like the bunnies.	1
These make a terrific snack! Probably would not have purchased them if it wasn't for grandchildren who love them.  Now they are my snack of choice.	1
Great snack, but a little small in size for its price compared to others, IMO.	1
If you're going to eat processed foods with added sugar, it should be Annie's. Organic, not too much sugar/processing - highly recommended!	1
good cracker/cooky	1
Yumm! These are great. I hadn't had them in years and picked them up while trying to fill up my prime pantry box - I'd buy again. My only hesitation is they're not organic. That said, I trust Annie's and think they're a great brand.	1
Yummy	1
These are very good!! Had never tried before and I love them! Great flavor and a handy snack :)	1
I order from Prime if I can find a comparable product to my grocery in terms of price and ratio in the Prime box (ie. does it fill too much of the box to make the order make sense vs. smaller items) and the ease of having dry foods come to the house directly instead of driving out into town (we are rural).  This item fits my criteria, and it came as it would from the store. Sometimes the boxes get dented because it will take a tumble around the UPS truck, but it's a box... the contents are fine.	1
So great for a chocolate craving!	1
My grandson loves these !  I now have a couple boxes on hand for when he comes for a visit. Very tasty too.	1
Delicious snack	1
Very tasty	1
I wanted to try these as a slightly healthier alternative to Teddy Grahams.  These are organic and have a few less ingredients.  FLAVOR: With three flavors of "bunnies" you get a medley that is kind of nice.  However, only the chocolate ones have enough flavor to even compare to a Teddy Graham.  The chocolate chip has a very, very mild chocolate flavor, but isn't too bad.  The honey flavor is pretty bland.  Honey Teddy Grahams have more flavor, so I'd choose them over plain honey bunnies.  TEXTURE: These bunnies get stale very fast.  Seal them up well, or you'll have bad tasting bunnies.  Fresh, they're crispy and crunchy and a great size for on-the-go snacking or sitting at your computer with a cup of coffee and these little cookies.  OVERALL OPINION I do like the organic factor.  However, they're generally a little more money than their competing Teddies, and I like Teddy flavor better.  It's up to you and your taste buds, but I would at least recommend trying the bunnies.  I buy them when they're on sale for cheaper than Teddies.	1
Tastes pretty good!	1
My husband loves Puffins, he's allergic to milk so there are not too many choices for him. He prefers the original but eats the peanut butter as a snack.	1
My partner has Celiac Disease and he truly enjoys the flavorable offering of this cereal, which he adds to his oatmeal and to his hiking mix.  I like that it is not GMO and it does not taste like cardboard, though It is too expensive for me to indulge in often. My two children with allergies and one with Celiac also like this cereal too.  Very happy it is available at Amazon at it is often not available in our town	1
Great product	1
Was hoping these would be good, but NOOOOO. These taste like the smell of a horse barn!!! Put them out on the back patio for the deer. They ate them. Probably because they taste like livestock feed.	-1
One of the best cereals I have ever eaten; not laden with sugar but is still slightly sweet. The peanut butter flavor is not overbearing and it stays firm until the last bite in your bowl. Just wish Amazon would offer this at their Prime Pantry price in the 6 pack-package deal like the other varieties this company makes.	1
This is one of my absolute favorite cereals. Very real peanut butter flavor, no weird artificial kind of taste. Very good price ordering through Prime Pantry (cheaper that buying at the grocery store)	1
This peanut butter Puffins cereals are delightful, just like all of the other Barbara's Puffins' cereals.  Love them.	1
Love my puffins!!	1
I prefer the original flavor and oats, but peanut butter was my second favorite. It still gets the full 5 stars because it has nothing of the artificial flavorings or colors, and no trans fats compared to the Reese's Peanut Butter Puffs when I had as a child growing up. The fiber content is an exceptional amount, and it's really tasty, but not too sweet to the point my almond milk doesn't taste sugary or turns brown. Another thing I liked about this cereal is that it doesn't get as soggy fast as the Quakers version of these cereal.	1
These are delightful. PB taste is only slightly sweet, a refreshing change from other commercial cereals.	1
Great cereal, tastes like peanut butter and sits well in milk. Can't really say much more other than that this cereal is definitely better for you than most of larger brands.	1
This is great cereal - w/out the guilt of high sugar cereal.	1
UGH! This cereal is what I imagine drywall to taste like. HORRIBLE	-1
Best cereal ever. Toddler approved!	1
One of my favorite Barbara's Puffins cereals	1
This is really good cereal not just for am, is a good crunchy snack as well	1
somehow I recall a different product...this one has a under taste I don't like	-1
One of my favorite cereals, with a not overly sweet taste. I love the tasty peanut butter flavor, and that they are natural.	1
Anything peanut butter goes fast around here.  These are wonderful!	1
Delicious and stays crispy in milk for a long time!	1
Niece loves this stuff.	1
These were stale and bland.  They're also an awkward, too large size.  The flavor they have is nice but they need a little more.  I didn't care for the texture but I couldn't tell if it's the brand or Amazon sent me an old/stale product.  I wouldn't recommend these, especially since they have almost no vitamins and minerals.  They're really just a sugary snack without the vitamins.	-1
:)	1
Kids loved them. Wish they were a better value though.	1
Kids love.  Great alternative to Capn Crunch.  Wish the box contained more servings.	1
Barbara's Bakery Cereal, Peanut Butter Puffins, 11 Oz. (312g), by Barbara's Bakery. This cereal is designed for kids. The cereal's title may not sound appetizing, but it tastes reasonably good, although not great, and it may leave your stomach feeling a bit queasy. Maybe my box was a bit rancid, as after eating a bowl, it started me burping, even though the Best By date was still in the future at: 07 June 2015. This is a puffed cereal, and the internal plastic bag is difficult to open. I am definitely not a weakling, but I had to use a pair of scissors to cut open the bag. After opening the bag, I noticed the smell of peanut butter, and after trying a piece of it, I decided that it tasted like corn and peanut butter. This cereal stands up to milk quite well without becoming soggy. I gave this cereal one star due to a strange aftertaste, too much peanut butter, the hard to open bag, my unsettled and burping stomach, and the high amount of salt used in making it. (Too much salt can cause high blood pressure and water retention. Processed foods in general contain far too much sugar and salt.) One bowl was enough. I dumped the remainder of the box into the galvanized metal bird seed barrel that I keep on the side porch for over-filling the bird feeder (the doves need to feed on the ground). At this point, it was too late to return it to the supermarket for a refund.

I love Puffins, Would like to see chocolate and peanut butter ones in the Amazon Pantry	1
Yum! These were fresh and delicious! I love Barbara's	1
Great transaction. Nice product.	1
My husband loves these, but my 6 year old daughter (who I purchased it for) doesn't. ;-)	1
Wonderful product - makes awesome bread, tastes delicious, organic, AND PACKAGE IS PLASTIC so the flour won't get stale before you open it!!! :D	1
This cereal is fantastic. Great crunch, nice flavor, hint of sweetness, plus its good for you. The cereal has no GMOs and tastes great with fruit. We have used both dairy milks and non-dairy milks and the cereal tastes great with both. Kids and adults will both love this cereal.  PROS: Great family cereal (liked by kids and adults alike.) Maintains texture and crunch even with milk No GMOs Organic Great flavor (even the plain flavor tastes great)  CONS: Expensive Sometimes hard to find	1
Love this flour. I used to buy King Arthur Unbleached Flour until I tried this. Now, nothing else will do. Makes great bread, pizza dough, cookies, muffins, everything.	1
This is an EXCELLENT quality, unbleached organic flour that is free of bromate/bromine/bromide.  I use it in my bread machine (I do add some vital wheat gluten and a couple of drops of Lugol's 2% iodine to improve the finished texture, but it isn't necessary).  Almost all commercial flours have added bromide; THIS DOES NOT and that, in my book, is a HUGE health plus.  To be brief, bromide is a halogen that competes with your thyroid's ability to uptake sufficient iodine for your metabolism to work at its peak.  Before the 1970's, commercial bread & bakery goods were baked using iodine as a dough conditioner, instead, but, for whatever reason, bromide is now used.  Hypothyroidism (or, rather, what I'd call "subclinical hypothyroidism") is rampant in America, and in my opinion, bromate used as a food additive is partially to blame.  I'd recommend health-conscious people Google "bromated vegetable oil," "bromide," "bromate," and "iodine" to learn more.  This flour is unavailable in my local area & I'm so glad to be able to get it via Amazon's new Prime Pantry grocery delivery service.  The price is reasonable and this makes a truly delicious loaf of fresh-baked bread.  Highly recommended!	1
Dairy free and husband with dairy allergy won't eat any other cereal. So glad Amazon Pantry stocks this!	1
My kids loved these.  Easy to throw in a backpack for snack.	1
Great taste, I don't know why they don't just call them prunes though?	1
very nice flavor.  quality packaging.  very happy	1
Excellent choice	1
Organic sweet yum! Great Price on Prime Pantry	1
My 15 month old grandson loves these they are tasty	1
Eensy weensy and crumb city (Don't give these to your kids if they're in the carseat, you'll never get the crumbs out!) but organic and doesn't have nearly as many horrible ingredients as other bars for kids and adults. These are not bad to toss in a diaper bag for just in case, but they crumble really easily so be careful they don't get squished. You know how little kids hate broken food! Kind of dry, made my daughter super thirsty. I would only give these to a child who can eat and drink well on his or her own just in case of choking.	1
The title pretty much says it all.  I reserve 5 stars for what I consider the best of the best.  I wanted a gluten-free cereal that was different from the few I've been eating over the years.  This is definitely NOT like the usual "crispy rice."  It's much more substantial (not "90% air"), has a nice, though not too strong, cocoa flavor, and doesn't get soggy in the first two minutes after milk (or other drink product) is poured on it.  Another rater talked about empty calories.  I'll be generous and assume that reviewer is not particularly familiar with reading (and comparing) nutrition labels.  If a high quality rice is also considered "empty calories," that review would be valid.  But comparing the Koala Crisp nutrition label to the nutrition label on a high quality rice reveals almost identical nutritional values - perhaps because Koala Crisp IS a high quality rice.  Just as rice has never been claimed to be a fully balanced meal, neither is Koala Crisp.  What it is, is a high quality product made with high quality ingredients (none of the artificial vitamins and minerals added to "grocery store" cereals to make them look better).  And it's designed to be used as part of a balanced diet.  With that out of the way, It's just plain good.  I buy it by the case, and eat it several times per week for breakfast, I like it that much.  And no, I have no connection with the company at all - I just love their products (many of them - not just this one).  Now, if they'd just add this one to their line of Eco-pak cereals (large, bulk bags), I'd be even happier.	1
Good.	1
Lacks flavor and substance I won't buy again.	-1
Tastes great!!!	1
One of my favorite cereals, and quite a guilty pleasure. Not health food by any means, but absolutely delicious	1
we love em ,  yummy , great price!!!!!!!	1
I love this cereal. Its a great value and I like that it is minimal packaging. It doesn't get soggy quickly. There is a nice peanut butter flavor but it is not to over powering. Even though it is a large bag it did not go stale quickly at all.	1
One of the kids' faves.	1
My kids love it. And we are not a 'granola-y' family by any means....it just tastes good! Just sweet enough.	1
Dessert cereal I can justify occasionally.	1
Very chocolatey and yummy. The kids like it (I like it) and makes the milk very chocolatey too. A family staple.	1
My kids love this cereal and I love that its organic and natural. I love that they don't add in dyes and lots of other chemicals in their food.	1
MY 4 YEAR OLD LOVES THIS CEREAL.  I LOVE THAT IT DOES NOT GET SOGGY IN MILK.	1
FABULOUS MIXTURE OF PEANUT BUTTER AND CHOCOLATE.  YUMMY.  DOES NOT GET SOGGY IN MILK.	1
love this cereal.  Great taste and it does not get soggy.	1
These are so yummy! We buy them almost every time I make a Prime Pantry box! We all love them!	1
Love this brand! I have started buying from the whole seller. We love all the good stuff they sell.	1
The kids love this stuff. I can't speak to it personally, but they devour a  bag quickly.	1
My kids love this exact brand and cereal, the  price is better than next door wholefoods so it was a nice win	1
This is a tasty gluten-free cereal that stands up to milk. Doesn't get soggy. A bit sweeter than I might sweeten it myself, but really pretty all-around good. I've been disappointed by many GF cereals, so I'm glad to find one that I can live with. Literally.	1
This has been one of my favorite cereals for years now. I think it has a great taste. The only one thing about it that gets to me a little is that it almost always seem to leave a film-like coating on my teeth whenever I eat it. The taste makes it well worth dealing with the film though. After all, it's nothing a quick dash to the toothbrush can't take care of right away. Will definitely purchase again and again in the future!	1
Love it will buy again.	1
First can I say that these bake dried snacks are not chunks. The pieces of mango are more like little flat squares that are almost totally dehydrated. They are definitely chewy treats. I don't know if the color of the mango is due to the dehydration process or some other reason. What I like most about these "chips" is that they are not coated in sugar. They taste very natural, however you need really good strong teeth to chew them. I will buy them again.  ~The Rebecca Review	1
Good cinnamon flavor	1
I was very happy to find this product on Amazon Pantry.  They really taste great and have the added benefit of being 100% Organic. They are also nut free, gluten free and Kosher...what more can you ask for?  ;1)  These make very good snacks,	1
I got these at Whole Foods. The pieces I COULD EAT out of the bag were tasty and nice. Chewy and flavorful. But half the bag had these ugly, bruised-dark looking bits, like they cut them off an overripe nasty section of mango.  I a Caribbean-born and mango is my favorite fruit. I had higher hopes for these. Ah, well.  Oh, and yeah, if you diet/calorie count, be careful of portion. The calories add up FAST....	-1
I first tried got these (Apple version) from Costco, when they were no longer available found them here on Amazon. Delicious, nutritious, organic snack, great for winter when fruit is not in season in northern climates. Especially good snack for kids. Health conscious people will appreciate these, and the slightly tart crispness is especially delicious accompanied by a nice mellow cheese. The auto ship is great if you have a family or kids who use them oftenb for lunches, and saves you some money too.	1
This product is of great quality. There was nothing wrong with this product, except I didn't realize that I would not feel like eating 12 bags of mangos right away. Use for a business to re-sell maybe? or share with a friend..	1
So tasty and a large bag lasted me months in fridge. My boyfriend says they Tarte better than candy and i agree sweet tooth craving can be squashed with a jerky like peice very flavorful!	1
Tasted good, kids will like they stay crunchy in milk. A little painful for my mouth, but that's me with less than this crunchy Cap'n Crunch	1
tastes good and stays nice and crisp	1
My kids' favorite cereal. Our whole family loves the taste. We really like all the EnviroKidz products we have tried.	1
Tastes great. My family really likes all the EnviroKidz products that we have tried.	1
This cereal tastes great. My kids, actually my whole family loves it.  We really enjoy all the EnviroKidz products that we have tried.	1
This cereal tastes great, peanut buttery, and not overly sweet like most breakfast cereals. Just sweet enough. I even eat it dry as a crunchy snack. Very tasty!	1
sorry but family disliked.	-1
One of my teens loves these, but to be fair they just the organic version of junk cereals. A far better choice, but still not as nutritious as cooking steel cut oats or something. We like them for a treat.	1
My kids love this as a treat. They're teens now, but still like it. While I'm not one to serve sweet cereals daily I'm happy to have this and have bought it many times over the years. I also prefer to buy it in bulk to save money.	1
I buy all Amy's Soups and this is clearly one of my favorites. It's quite hearty, has lots of nice veggies, is not too thick, and is a perfect meal for lunch!  I serve it frequently because it's organic and very healthy and no one ever tires of it!	1
Descent taste, a little high on salt, but over all great!	1
Just chocolate lay enough to satisfy my kids. It's a staple cereal in our house.	1
My son loved these!!	1
Very good and tasty	1
I enjoed the soup it was a good black bean soup, tasty.  need 12 more word 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  that is dumb  way to take a review fewer words a clear	1
Healthy yes, tasty well I have to get use to it.	1
Very good!	1
love it	1
good stuff	1
addictive	1
Very good berries.	1
Very good, but to sweet for my tastes.	1
Tasty.	1
Yummy in my tummy :)	1
I actually ordered these to mix in with my dog's food. Normally, she is crazy for cranberries, but she didn't seem to like these as much as others. So I tasted them to learn that they have less sugar than others, and that seems to be her problem. But they are very good! So these are now mine. I'll have to buy her some that are less healthy...	1
This is a great low fat soup.	1
Tasty	1
Good Quality. Great Price. Fast Delivery.	1
Hubby loved it.	1
Very tasty soup.  I love black beans and this was perfectly blended.	1
It's a bit thicker than I like and a bit too bland for some family members but I like it very much as a healthy soup. Another go to when hungry with little time to spare. I rarely add salt to anything but I do to this.	1
Love all Amy products!	1
Not impressed with this cereal -- tasted like "fake chocolate," and the cereal was soggy well before I could finish a bowl with milk.  Not going to re-purchase.	-1
I love this cereal, it tastes so good and very satisfying.	1
Love the "panda puffs" version, but the "elephant puffs" were not a hit with my son. Pronounced cinnamon flavor.	1
Great soup. flavorful.	1
Overall I did not like this and would not buy it again. For me it was really three issues: taste, texture, and appearance.  First off the taste isn't bad. However it just tastes too mild. While that does mean the flavors blend well it also means that for something that uses a lot a bold ingredients it all tastes like less than the sum of its parts.  The texture and appearance are of that of refried black beans. I had to scoop this out of the can with a spoon. While I do enjoy thick soups this was just so thick it didn't seem like soup anymore. That and the lack of the attractive looking corn and bean pieces shown on the picture just overall led to an underwhelming product for me.	-1
Delicious just like all of Amy's!!	1
no flavor	-1
good stuff.  Amy's stuff is always good quality and relatively healthy for mass produced canned stuff.	1
I like "Amy's Soups" , in general & this soup met my expectations, in terms or quality & price!	1
Too good tasting kids ate them all too fast! :)	1
YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!! 4 stars for small box, high price, and such a simple ingredients list there's no way it costs that much to make. Or maybe it does?? It is soooo good, but gonna stick to Cocoa Pebbles because they are in the budget...	1
My guilty pleasure. Without the crap in it, of course.. The kids love it, mama loves the ingredients. Win win!	1
This cereal is sooo good! I justify buying it because it is organic and NonGMO and better than so many other store brand choices...  Although it is not high in protein or high in fiber, like some of our other cereals we have on Subscribe and Save... It is so simple and yet so good!! This is my husband's favorite and our granddaughter's as well. Okay, it's my favorite too...  I just prefer to order others because, quite frankly, I'm a cereal killer, and I need more protein to balance things out.  If you're like me, please don't feel guilty for trying these, as it clearly is not high cal or high fat or unhealthy by any means, in my book anyway. Just add protein if you like and enjoy!  A couple I recommend: <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Nature-s-Bounty-Protein-Shake-Mix-Decadent-Chocolate-16-Ounce/dp/B007ZP1JGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Nature's Bounty Protein Shake Mix, Decadent Chocolate, 16 Ounce</a> <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Optimum-Nutrition-100-Natural-Oats-and-Whey-Vanilla-Bean-3-Pound/dp/B002DYJ0KW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Optimum Nutrition 100% Natural Oats and Whey, Vanilla Bean, 3 Pound</a>  Peanut butter being my guilty pleasure, we take a spoonful to the inside of our bowl of cereal and have a taste of PB with each bite, lol! Can't beat it!! Smile.  Highly recommended. Hope this helps!	1
I make my own soups and hate most canned soups but this canned soup I can stomach. I buy this black bean soup mostly for my son who fell in love with my black bean soup but I do not make this soup very often because I can never make just a small amount and I do not want to eat black bean soup for a week. So I bought this awhile ago for my son to tried it and he loved this soup. I cannot guarantee you will like it like us because tastes are personal from person to person but if you like black bean soup then give it a try.	1
GREAT tasting, low fat black bean soup.  But you need to know that ANYTHING by AMY'S is going to be healthy and great tasting. She has not let me down once.  Great company if you want to eat healthy foods.	1
Good flavor but this single serving size. Do not add water. Therefore pricey!	1
Yummy.	1
Needs salt.	1
Amy's soups are delicious.  Have tried many kinds...	1
Another staple in our home. When we realized our grandchildren's health needs would be better served to eat mostly gluten free foods, "Gorilla Munch" became one of our favorite cereals. Great for a little snack for your toddlers, it is also a great, healthy alternative to many of the cereals currently on the market and can be enjoyed by the entire family. Ingredients: Organic corn meal, organic evaporated cane juice, sea salt.	1
TASTE GREAT	1
One of my standard soups! I combine one can of this in the blender with one cartoon on non fat Fage Greek yogurt for a delicious cold soup.	1
Amy's soups are delicious.  I also like the fact that they have no PBA in the cans,  whatever that is.  I have heard from nutrition magazines that PBA is one more thing the manufacturers add to our food which is detremental.  By the ingredient list on the side of the can,  I believe that Amy's soups are healthier than the other soups on the market. Judi	1
Great balance of texture, taste and nutrition.	1
The kids love it.	1
The kids love it.	1
Good soup	1
I get Amy's soups because it is one of the few soups that use organic ingredients AND BPA-free can liners. It helps that the soups taste good too.	1
This is one of my favorite canned soups!  It is hearty and super flavorful!  Goes great with tortilla chips, or alone.  I sometimes add some ground turkey to bulk it up a bit.	1
Love	1
My granddaughter really likes these and they really taste good!	1
Love this GF NON-GMO cereal.  We've been eating this for about 5 years now & we love it.  I do notice the S&S price fluctuates on it, & it went way up for a while, but now the price is more reasonable again so we were able to start buying it again.  This is chocolatey, sweet, yet not overly so, IMO... but I do like sweets.  It would make FANTASTIC chocolate krispy treats... hmmm, we have to make some of those :).  Nature's Path, who makes this cereal, has been tested multiple times to verify the NON-GMO status & they have always ranked the best, even better than other famous GF brands who only CLAIM to be GMO free... Envirokidz & Nature's Path actually IS GMO free!	1

family favorite	1
no high fructose corn syrup and it tastes good. This is my compromise with my kids who I won't let eat Frosted flakes.	1
Gmo free and it tastes great	1
Great flavor and great taste.	1
Great Seller!!! Everything went perfect!!!	1
I always look for full flavor, low fat, and a smooth puke. This product delivers all three in the convenience of a canned soup. Now I can lie to my family that I do eat, as I shrink into oblivion. This soup comes up easy and will not tear your esophageal track like a more chunky product	1
I love this soup, it's my Go To for a quick meal in the winter.  I add a little chopped green onion, cheddar chess and sour cream.	1
A healthy soup, but to be honest, it needs a little push of hot sauce or salt to make it a little better. But if you are veg-head like me it is a better soup than most. I am still waiting for somebody to make a vegetable that taste like bacon or pork sausage, but, without the sin of eating one of god's creatures. I know. I am a heretic. Most people don't realize that a pig is smarter than most dogs, or that most of the world dines on bugs and goat. I am hoping this review gets me a job the Travel Network like Tony Bourdain had. Well good luck to all you diners and try the soup, but be creative, add a little sour cream and a little avocado sliced in precise shapes of polygons.	1
I ordered a mix of Amy's soups, and some of the cans arrived severely dented -- to the point I'm surprised they didn't leak. But, the soup is very tasty.	1
I'm surprised at how tasty Amys soups are. This is def weird looking but one of my favorites.  Kinda curious if there is a normal black bean soup as opposed to " Low Fat "	1
This is a very healthy low fat black bean soup.  It has a little spicy flavor to it.  I would recommend this soup to anyone for a quick healthy meal.  All of Amy's canned soups are superb.	1
It's Amy's, it's excellent	1
good	1
You can't go wrong with this soup. As a vegetarian I struggle to find good tasting canned soups. This soup has changed everything! Its now my "go to" soup when I am looking for a quick meal.  The soup has a great taste, is made with high quality veggies, its organic, and its good for you too!  Try it - you won't be disappointed!	1
It's addictive we need a double pack to make it though to the next shipment lol	1
Very flavorful!	1
Amy's soups: always tasty, always vegetarian.	1
Really good soup.	1
I didn't like the taste of this. Just my opinion.	-1
Great taste.	1
Pretty good soup.	1
Tastes just like Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch cereal, but much healthier. Organic and gluten free. They are crunchy, but not so crunchy that they tear up the inside of your mouth.	1

Every Amy's Soup is wonderful!	1

I love these things and they taste even better than what you're used to in the "cocoa puff" variety.	1
Delicious and wholesome cereal! Love this stuff!	1
One of my favorite Amy's soups. A staple for me. Healthy, low in calories, taste good. I like the slight firey bite to it.	1
Loved the taste!	1

We love the cereal so much! Children love it because it tastes great and I love it because it's organic and it has great ingredients!	1
My kids love this cereal! I love it too, because it is organic and that is a very important to me!	1
Amy's soups are a great idea for a quick lunch idea when I wasn't able to make lunch the night before	1
Great stuff!	1
I buy many types of Amy's Soups and like them because they are healthy, usually low in calories, many are organic and some in safe cans.  However this soup is only for those who like HOT & SPICY! Wow! I just ate a bowl and my mouth is still burning. It was so spicy I couldn't really taste the veggies.  I know many ppl like very spicy foods but I'm not one of them.  Taste at your own risk. :))	1
very flavorful soup.  nice combination of vegetables.  different than any other I have tried.	1
My kids love this cereal.  My husband likes to sneak a bowl of it now and again.	1
There aren't many choices out there when you have to go gluten free.  I was so thrilled to find these for my daughter.  She loves them!	1
My son is gluten free and finding cereal is tough.  I was so thrilled to find these.  He loves them!!!	1
Love it.	1
My kids love it.	1
I bought this for husband's breakfast, he's allergic to milk. He eats it as a snack food. A small bowl while he's gaming and much better than chips!	1
These Black Beans by Westbrae are awesome.  The beans are not mushy and have a great flavor.  As a bonus, you shouldn't have to worry about chemicals and sprays in your food so Westbrae went through the hassle of finding Organic Beans to be able to label their product USDA Organic. The liner of the can is BPA free to give you even further peace of mind.  Westbrae Brand is my new favorite brand of canned beans and I hope you will find them as good as I have.	1
Delicious and convenient well prepared black beans.  Even though drained off liquid it is  a bit too salty for my taste.  However, I am sensitive to salt. The potassium in this product is negated by the salt.  Salt is a great preservative but too much can cause problems.   Most friends that tried this loved it and said it was not too salty.  Thus, it is a quirk of mine with my health concerns.   Overall good quality and works well in black bean salad and black bean soup or dip.  Makes great meat substitute.	1
Well,after all is said and done, I could have soaked the beans myself..but for ease and when time is of the essence this product is great~!	1
Love these beans, great for soups, salads, wraps and anything else you can dream up. Very tasty and versatile.	1
....same price as Walmart stores and worth it to me to pay pantry fee to get them at my door...price is up again :(  but will buy again if they go back to that price again. we were looking for non bpa lining and found these in Walmart stores at $1.18...cant find ANY other non bpa, organic or other for that price...so I guess I'll be getting them at Walmart, but will be watching these..would be 6 stars  if price had stayed low!	1
These are a great addition to almost any meal, but particularly good as a pairing with any mexican dish.  The beans are tender and perfectly cooked, there is no sugar, it is organic, and practically perfect in every way.  Thank you Westbrae!	1
Good product at good price	1
Very good	1
The only reason I give this can o' beans 4 stars is due to the price. At many stores, and other locations where one might procure beans, specifically in a can, they tend to be closer to the $1 range. However, if you have the tendency to stay at home, forget things at grocery lists, want to stay lazy for a bit, but still want your can o' beans, then these beans are here for you, just as they once were there for me. It is nice to see the large organic label on the front of the can, though to claim that beans are vegetarian seems a bit excessive; I would be concerned if my beans were made of meat. This may be to avoid confusion with beans that are sometimes mixed with meat in the same can, but these are usually clearly labeled, and often have so little meat that it's practically vegetarian anyway. Regardless, these beans served their purpose well. Black beans work especially well in chili mixes (or any bean other than refried/mashed, but I prefer the black bean), and a vast array of other concoctions. As some people mention, they weren't mush, which is good, and all the beans were thoroughly cooked. Of course, I expected both of these things; if I ate an uncooked canned bean, this would be getting a 1-star review.	1
Black beans and taco's.... :))	1
great protein!	1
great beans	1
These black beans are great. If you want beans that are already done and ready to heat and serve than this is wonderful. Organic and vegetarian. No GMO's Simple to use and easy to prepare anyway that you want to do. LOVE the ingredient list -- water, organic black beans and sea salt Non BPA can liner  HINT These have sea salt but do not have a salty taste A little hot sauce goes a long way in flavoring them  HIGHLY RECOMMEND Westbrae Natural Vegetarian Organic Black Beans	1
Fresh and on time!	1
Not quite use to this yet, but they are healthy	1
a gift for a friend and she loved it.	1
Not worth the extra expense. Buy your local grocery brand.	-1
good but pricey	1
Liked it	1
Tastes good, cooks well.	1
Tastes fine	1
So happy that my favorite black beans are organic!!	1
The big and bad with the tiny and petite.	1
Yummy and organic	1
As described.	1
My kids (ages 7 & 8), LOVE this cereal!  They've been eating it almost everyday since I bought the multi-pack through Subscribe & Save.  I had to order it more often!  It's NATURAL which is great!	1
Ho boy, ho bo, ho bo?	1
yummy	1
I add these to my beef and rice casserole and they work great.	1
Good product	1
Trying to get my insulin resistance under control. Having hormonal troubles of all kinds. I was eating cereal and feeling lousy. It occurred to me that maybe it was the off the shelf stuff making me ill. Four days into eating this cereal I was able to not only stick to my diet(starving in mid morning)and get through to a normal fruit snack at 10:30. I was feeling BETTER. Shakes gone...random dizziness gone....less muscle pain.	1
The beans are organic and that appeals to me right away.  They have a good flavor and work well to heat up and eat as a side dish, to put in a casserole dish or whatever you can create as a appetizing meal use.	1
Love it.	1
test good!	1
I am a black bean lover, but these taste so good I have been known to eat then right out of the can.	1
Taste is not good	-1
Put them into a summer salad.	1
Black beans are one of the most nutritious foods you can put in your body. They are a low cost, nutritional addition to many meals. I add a couple tablespoons to my tuna salad, chili and salad!!!	1
I tend to put black beans in a lot of my dishes.  These are good.	1
Haven't opened them yet, but beans are beans. Can't go wrong with beans	1
Reviewed on arrival	1
Great!	1
Excellent flavor.	1
The were very good. Fresh	1
We love this gluten free cereal & are very happy that Nature's Path has been proven to be one of the only brands that are truly GMO free as labeled, unlike other brands, like Barbara's, who only claim to be GMO free.	1

I love Black Beans, this Brand is Ok, but not the best I ever had.	1
Good beans	1
Organic proteinaetious plant matter.	1
Decent black beans, nothing else to say	1
Great price for organic beans, I can't complain. I use them when I have no time for soaking and boil dried beans.	1
We add these black beans to rice and quinoa, soups, salads and mash them into refried beans for tacos and burritos-Yum!	1
How can you go wrong having this at home?	1
Totally beans.	1
Excellent and an easy meal or fried beans.	1
We bought this at the local natural food store and my 6 and 8 year old kids LOVE it.  I decanted the cereal into a large glass container (similar to the ones you see full of cotton balls in a doctor's office) with an easy-open lid, put a little scoop in there and they can serve themselves easily.  One thing:  It only stays fresh for about a month or so once put into a glass container, but it's better than leaving it in plastic to possibly absorb all the nasty plastic chemicals.  I wish companies would stop putting our FOOD in plastic and go back to paper/foil!	1
I think this is a fine product.  The flavoring is great, the almond crispiness throws a nice flavor profile with the cheese flavoring.  I tried to eat just the recommended serving size but, to be honest, the darn things were so good that before I knew it, I had an empty package of Nut Thins and some wonderful cheese dust on my fingers.  I'll definitely buy this again and again.	1
As far as sweetened cereals go, this one is not bad. We serve it with protein rich foods for a rounded breakfast, and it makes the kids happy.  It's also great dry as a fairly healthy snack. No one in our family has a problem with gluten, but I sure am glad this is available to children who do.	1
Everyone in our family of seven enjoys this cereal.  I love that it is organic and delicious. Yes, it has sugar, but you have to pick your battles when it comes to children and health food. I buy other items in this brand for the kids, but kids and adults alike grab this one. I am glad it is available for "Subscribe And Save".	1
Once I poured the milk on my bowl of EnviroKidz Organic Chocolate Koala Crisp Cereal, the chocolate slowly started coming off of the cereal and into the milk. The cereal absorbs the milk and causes the cereal to swell and have the most unpleasant, mushy texture. Maybe kids like it, but, as an adult who occasionally enjoys eating kids cereals, this cereal is awful.  I'm actively cutting any GMO products out of my diet. Kellogg's Cocoa Krispies has been a long time favorite of mine but contains High Fructose Corn Syrup, most likely made from GMO corn. I thought this would be a great substitute. I'm hoping to find some cereal that equals what I'm used to eating in texture and taste to an acceptable degree. I am so sick of granola and hope I can find some cereals that I actually like.	-1
Very good and make a light snack.	1
Too dry/hard	-1
Love'em	1
Good taste, but not much volume in the box	1
These are my favorite crackers at the moment...all flavors (minus the pecan)! :) The cream ranch and the cheddar are particularly yummy! I'm pleased with the nutritional information and the serving size, as well.	1
Being gluten free, I am always looking for products that make life a little more normal (ie: crackers with cheese or soup).  These are delicious,. albiet a bit expensive.  My husband loved the flavor and they went well with chili!	1
love them	1
They are pretty yummy.	1
My kids love this cereal.  Very tasty and I love that it is organic.  A great choice if you want your kids to eat healthier.	1
Very fresh tasting, soft and trustworthy	1
great price for organic raisins	1
Tasty gluten free cracker. I'd buy again.	1
not a lot of flavor	1
After Envirokidz changed their packaging to this new design I lost sleep at night for several weeks.  You cannot even imagine how rustled my jimmies were.  I eventually emailed the company to see why they changed the box design.  About a week later I got a (very unsatisfying) response.  All they said was:  "Our gorilla had a makeover.  If you miss the original gorilla, you can always find him here: [...]  Since the beginning of 2012, Nature's Path had been in the process of redesigning all of our packaging and wanted to give the Envirokidz packaging a new look and feel as we move towards a full line of products that finally looks like the family they are. Your comments have been passed to our Brand Manager and our marketing team."  Believe me when I say that these jimmies do not taste the same as the old ones.  They are good but not as good.  I would recommend a different cereal like Oreo O's or Count Chocula.	-1
This is tasty cereal that kids enjoy and even I didn't mind eating. Like that it's organic and all natural.	1
These are so good! I'm dieting, and love chips and crackers,  so this is a nice alternative. They are veey crunchy. Kind of like a kettle chip. Lots of flavor.	1
These are very crunchy crispy and loaded with cheese flavor. The box is small but they are satisfying eating the recommend serving. Great if you are gluten sensitive,  great if you aren't. Highly recommended.	1
You want a tasty cracker but you want a natural and healthy alternative...this is it!	1
Delicious	1
It tastes so plain.. it just has a tiny hint of peanut butter.. barely detectable.  It is NOT EVEN CLOSE to Captain Crunch's Peanut Butter Crunch in the amount of peanut butter used.  It tastes more like Kix, as someone else has noted.  that's a shame because I really wish we had an Organic alternative to captain crunch's peanut butter cereal  For what it is.. (a non-peanut butter cereal) that tastes like kix.. it is so so.  I like it a little  I hope they improve this cereal and increase the peanut butter soon.. they need to add 10x more	-1
Awesome!!	1
meh	-1
I have never tried Nut-thins before and thought I would give it a try.  Actually, they are really good to be healthy.  I was surprised and couldn't hardly stop eating them.  I'm sure they can't be as good if you eat them all in one sitting.  lol  I have them on my grocery list to pick up more when I go out.  I don't know if I can wait for another shipment since I may be out before then.	1
Chewing nut thins is unpleasant. It's like the crackers are too dry, become really compacted after exposure to moisture, and then you feel like you're grinding mill. The flavor is okay.	-1
Love it.  Great deal and great product.	1
Gluten free!  Taste great.	1
My kids love this cereal! I love that they don't have a ton of junk in their cereal. Add a banana or cutie and yeah, yummy breakfast!	1
Excellent product and shipping.	1
All of the Nut Thin Crackers are delicious. This one has a nice cheddar flavor, very good.	1
The best tasting cracker I've ever found. The box should be bigger but these crackers go good with lots of different tastes.	1
These were something new to try and me and my friends really liked them. good to munch with or without a dip or cream cheese. Delicious	1
DELICIOUS	1
This cereal is awesome! Great tasting, organic and healthy! Great for kids and even adults! I personally enjoy a bowl a day.	1
Excellent quality, great ingredients and healthy! I couldn't believe how good it tastes despite the healthy ingredients. I also doesn't become soggy very quickly.	1
great	1
Needed to stock my motorhome.  This was a perfect size.	1
Everyone else in the world might love these, but they don't do a thing for me. For one thing, I cannot taste even a hint of almonds. They are thin, and crispy, but they are more like rice crackers. If you read the list of ingredients you will find almonds way, way down there.	-1
These are yummy and borderline addictive.	1
Delicious.	1
How good can nut & rice crackers be? The only time I ever had rice crackers was from my roommate in college who insisted they were the best thing in the world, but to me they tasted how hair smells when it gets vacuumed. Horrible. But these... these guys are made with almonds too, and they're cheddar cheese flavor... Very tempting.  When they first came, I was hesitant. I almost regretted it. "How good can they be?" I repeated in my head. I eventually craved a cheesy flavored snack and dug in...  THEY WERE THE BEST CHEESY FLAVORED CRACKERS I'VE EVER HAD!!! Seriously. They didn't skimp on the powdered cheese, and they were crunchy and tasty and I wish I had more. Will putting in an order for more soon! Someone's doing they're job right! :)	1
While captain crunch peanut butter cereal isn't organic and has preservatives, (yuck) they make the best-tasting  Panda Puffs peanut butter cereal has almost no peanut butter taste.  It may be healthier but when i buy peanut butter cereal i expect it to taste like it... but their cereal tastes more like Kix.. just bland puffed corn balls.  I wish Panda Puffs tasted just like captain crunches peanut butter crunch but it doesn't even come close.	-1
Very moist and sweet. Not everyone like the taste of prunes but these are very good.	1
These taste pretty close to the old standard - Cocoa Crispies. These actually stay crisper in milk for longer - really a long, long time. Good cocoa taste, and colors the milk just like old times. Fair price too!	1
This is a great cereal and my family thinks it is better than Frosted Flakes.  Both my kids have to be Gluten Free and this has been an wonderful addition to our pantry.	1
Pretty good for GF cereal. I don't crave it but I like it. The peanut butter and chocoloate flavors could be stronger and I'd probably like it better.	1
This is my favorite. It is a little sweet, kind of like kix. They don't get all mushy like some of the other GF cereals.	1
Taste little dry.	1
prunes with pits sometimes	1
Very good. Prefer the round cardboard container that other brands use. The inside of this container can get sticky which transfers to you hands each time you reach in. Have had other brands that taste better but they weren't organic.	1
I bought these for a daughter of mine and she says they are the BEST so I don't know why the reviews seemed negative; however, she likes *prunes and, maybe, you have to have an *acquired taste for them. She said, too, she likes these prunes by themselves and with an organic granola blend I sent her; so, maybe, try them with granola, yourself, to enjoy them. Remember, they are *organic and are full of nutrients and are considered *healthy; that's why I bought them but am glad my daughter likes them, too.	1
Very soft and juicy. Much more palatable than bulk store dried plums which can get hard and chewy.	1
These are healthy organic prunes which were delicious. The texture was similar to a gummy bear candy, but the taste is amazing. They also work well for recipes!	1
Not as good as expected. Leaves a slight bitter aftertaste.  Not up to standard for Newman branded products.	-1
One of my favorite gluten free cereals.  Amazon's subscribe and save program allows me to have the PB Panda Puffs on hand and at an affordable price.  I would have to drive a good 20 minutes to the grocery store in the next town over to find them locally, if they are in-stock.  I like to mix them with a bag of Rice Krispies to help them last just a bit longer and to cut down on the amount of sugar (7g per serving). I normally eat these at least six days a week, simply the best!	1
If you like prunes, you will love these.	1
These rare really good! Top quality and very moist. Wish there were more in the bag but will purchase again , much better quality than other store brands.	1
omg! these are fab! you almost need a fork to go in the bag....they are a touch messy but who cares lol...yum!	1
love them	1
Check out the ingredient list on these.  You can prononce all of them easily and count them on one hand.  We really liked this cereal after purchasing it because it is gluten free.  The flakes are a bit thicker and crunchier than regular.	1
The flavor is good, but these prunes are super sticky.	1
Item was as described and shipped quickly. Thank you.	1
They are bitter,mushy and overpriced. Would never buy them again.  I couldn't believe the reviews I read about the bitterness but then I tasted them  ,my husband agreed they were bitter and mushy. I'll stick with SunSweet.  I usually like Newmans Own products but not this one.	-1
Yum!	1
I just wanted to point out a few things before I begin my review. Someone happened to complain that in the cereal there is no strawberries as pictured on the box. The fruit pictured on the envirokidz cereal boxes is just a suggestion of a fruit you can add to the cereal, it does not mean that there is fruit included in the cereal. Also I wanted to thank Sophie for pointing out the nutritional information, :). (and no I am not related to the makers of the envirokidz cereals) Okay, this cereal, as many people in other reviews have already pointed out, tastes like Kix. Has a nice texture, but since I am allergic to corn I can only have this cereal in small amounts and usually eat some of the other envirokidz cereals. I wish they would make a raspberry or cinnamon cereal. But this cereal is very good and you should try it! :)	1
This product is very similar to corn flakes, which I ate sometimes before I had to go gluten free. It's not my favorite product in the envirokidz line, but it was good. I wanted to also point out this little joke. AMAZON Frosted Flakes review for AMAZON.com. LOL! :)	1
Leapin Lemurs GF cereal is like Peanut Butter Panda Puffs and Koala Crisp mixed together, except it is all puffs. It is pretty expensive at my local grocery store. I end up paying a whole $2.00 more than on some of the other envirokidz cereals. I ate this cereal once and it was good, and I'm glad that envirokidz came up with this chocolaty, peanut butter cereal. But as it is so expensive, I just buy Peanut Butter Panda Puffs and Koala Crisp and mix them. I do wish that Leapin' Lemurs had the same amount of chocolate and peanut butter puffs, but us Celiac's can't be too picky. I hope you choose to enjoy Leapin' Lemurs! :)	1
This is a yummy GF cereal. I would have liked a little stronger peanut butter taste, and a little less sweetness. But it was good and it is HARD to find good, and good for you, gluten free cereals. I liked the little puffs, and I think, like one rater suggested, I'll try mixing Koala Crisp and Peanut Butter Panda Puffs, it sounds delicious and I can't believe I didn't think of that myself. I recommend this as well as the other GF EnviroKidz cereals. Enjoy! :)	1
Very good prunes. Very like Sun kissed prunes	1
A+ Thank you.	1
ok	1
My daughter loves this cereal.  It is a staple in our house.  The sugar content is not too high.  My son, who is not a celiac, often requests this as well.	1
They Work! lol	1
Love the juiciness	1
Love them...They are soft and have a lot of flavor	1
Prunes!	1
Do not pay too much for the same thing, actually more squished thing. I will by Sunsweet next time.	1
Very moist and tasty	1
I thought  a prune  was a prune  until I had these!  Plump, sweet, almost juicy  very close to eating a fresh plum, with concentrated plum flavor.  So satisfying to eat if you love gummy, chewy candy, and I would imagine they are fantastic to cook  or bake with. Miles ahead of dried leathery versions of this fruit sold in grocery stores.	1
These tasted really strange. I had to throw them away.	-1
These prunes have a sort of burnt taste, and are not sweet at all. Too expensive for what you get.  My husband likes dried fruit, but these just were not tasty.	-1
Koala Crisp is a delicious gluten free cereal. It is crispy and has a nice chocolate flavor. It's cheaper than a lot of gluten free cereals I have seen, close to almost half the price. It is a bit higher in sugar content, but sometimes we all want something sweet. And there is more in the box than some cereals. (the ones that are twice the price. Doesn't seem fair does it?) Anyway there is a fun game board for kids on the inside of the box.  Highly Recommended!	1
As far as prunes go these are the only ones I've purchased more then once.  I add them to smoothies for health benefits.  Always fresh and easy to store,  by a brand I trust for my family.	1
I try to avoid buying dried fruits online, because they tend to be over priced. Not on here. So, I saw a lot of people complained about how slimy the prunes were, but I bought it anyway, because I am fed up of eating like really dried prunes that aren't naturally moist inside. At my local grocery store, these go for $5 to $6 for a six oz. bag. I took the opportunity to get these online and tried them out. Even though they are slimy, that is how the prunes are naturally preserved rather than loaded with sulfites and other man made or hard pronouncing chemicals, or even the loaded added sugars. So these, not only they're organic, they're naturally sweet, and have a great mouth feel to them. I am quite pleased I must say.	1
love as snacks	1
nice and sweet	1
I love Newman's products and these prunes are no exception.	1
The best-tasting prunes I've ever had. They're often unavailable, so stock up when you can.	1
Great prunes.  Very small package.  I think that someone is helping me eat them.  They could not be going down so fast with just me eating them.  They are nice and soft and have a great prune flavor.  Okay, where did my prunes go?  You get back here and let me have some.  Who am I talking to?  Well, it is just the cats and me.  Those sneaky little devils, who knew that cats like prunes too.  Well, here is the bag.  Right here under these papers I was working  on....oops.  Well they are good.	1
Received as described and in a timely manner.  Like this item.	1
Tastes great soft and moist love em	1
My daughter loves this cereal.  It has become her new favorite and she eats a bowl every morning.  It is not too sweet and still healthy.  (I am also a celiac and this is a bit too peanut buttery for me in the morning...)	1
It's got just the right amount of PB flavor and stays crunchy in milk. I am disappointed that they shrank the box size recently as it doesn't hold much for the price. By the way, this product is much cheaper at Trader Joe's and other grocery stores in my area.	1
great	1
They are great for prunes, but what is a bad prune??? They were moist and soft, very sweet.	1
Delicious	1
Fried very well in olive oil, nice flavor and perfect for meatless meals	1
Very good tasting polenta. I made a casserole and we ate it all week.	1
This is just a good basic polenta that I don't have to make for myself. I enjoy slicing and frying this as a base for sauces or as "lasagna" on a plate like nachos. I hope Amazon makes the other flavors such as sun-dried tomato and garlic and basil available soon.	1
My wife makes her own polenta, but when she's run out of the corn meal, this is an excellent, fast option for supper.  She slices it into circles, not too thin, and fries it in an olive oil/butter mixture in which she has already sauteed onion, garlic, and peppers. Sometimes mushrooms. When the polenta is slightly crispy on both sides, she adds veggies back in and (just for me) a handful of chopped cooked chicken.  Then she puts a  little chicken broth mixed with about a half cup of thickened tomato puree . Sprinkles herbs & a few shreds of parmesan to the top of each slice. After adding a generous slice of fresh mozzarella to the top of each polenta piece she runs the whole thing under the broiler till the cheese bubbles.  Definitely we keep tubes of these in the pantry. Italian grits.	1
My son loves this cereal, especially with chocolate soymilk. This company also makes Koala Crisp Cereal, if we have that, my kids will mix the Panda Puffs with the Koala Crisp (which has a chocolate flavor) as they think it tastes like a Reese Cup. I like that there are only 7g of sugar per serving (much less than many kids cereals) and all the ingredients are organic. Once in milk this cereal will also stay crispy a little longer than Rice Crispies, but not much. If you have to make Rice Crispy treats for the school bake sale - use these cereals instead for an extra yummy treat.	1
this is a great deal, the best deal for the money, I found online under Gluten free same brand. Great deal too that you can get it sent automatically on a regular basis and not need to worry about running out and reordering nor paying for shipping. Great time saver and great to eat, not just for kids. Stays crisp even in milk. Great for s snack.	1
This is the best rice and it cooks very quickly and is extremely creamy.  It is a favorite at our home.	1
The best risotto rice, you cant make risotto without it.	1
My husband is Italian and this is our household rice.  We probably have rice 3 or four times a week in some preparation, and we prefer this brand and this variety of rice.  The quality is outstanding, and very consistent from one package to the next.	1
Great rice.	1
Great quality product at a great price!! Love making risotto more often now! Love it!	1
This is great rice for making risotto.	1
After trying this product on Amazon, it's all we will use when making risotto. The price is reasonable and it's a tasty product!	1
GOOD!	1
Love this rice! Perfect for risotto! Made in instant pot, perfect in 12 min!!	1
good to make risottos -- by my italian friends tested by me 100 times -- a super risotto lover	1
Great	1
This is the perfect rice for risotto or pilaf or rice pudding (or any rice based dessert). The texture and taste are just on point. I'm not a fan of the Velcro packaging of Lundberg rice, but the rice is always great quality.	1
High quality starchy rice for risotto, rice pudding or for thickening soups and stews	1
Good eats.	1
This is a really big bag of high quality risotto rice.	1
I was not sure what I was getting with this kind of rice. It tastes good, and has a different and softer texture than regular rice	1
Delicious  rice, can't go wrong with it	1
One of the best things about Amazon is giving rural people access to products we wouldn't otherwise. That deal is only sweetened when it's delivered to your front door. This makes for a hearty side dish that stores well. My kids loves it.	1
Super Rice	1
Hubby loves this rice. I use in race cooker and add a bit more liquid than regular rice to make creamier.  Quality rice. Price is good	1
We use this for Risotto which used to be a rarity in our lives.  One of my slow cookers makes it though.  My son is a chef and this is one of his specialties.  When he makes it is it like licking heaven.  The slow cooker also makes it.  Not in the same way, not to the same end.  But far more conveniently.  (He says I don't eat enough to make it worth his while.)	1
good	1
Wonderful, creamy short grained rice that pairs incredibly well with butter and a salad. I can write more but its rice! And its good!	1
Good rice.	1
good risotto	1
Thank you.	1
i love it	1
Yummy. This rice is perfect for risotto, I really like the Velcro seal instead of the typical zipper bag seal.	1
The rice, like all Lundberg rice is tasty and the quality is great.  I like the resealable bag, which keeps it dry and less likely to spill all over the cabinet due to any clumsiness.	1
Love this type of rice. It goes great with so many dishes. It doesn't cook up sticky or anything like that. It's very versatile.	1
I had never tried arborio rice, but it's very tasty.	1
Very happy with my items that I received, exactly as described. I would recommend this seller and there products.  Very Happy Customer and will buy from again.  Thank you!	1
best price I've found on arborio and high quality rice	1
Great rice, love that it is organic.	1
great rice	1
Very good rice for risotto.	1
great rice just love it	1
They were good.	1
Yum...so tender and sweet.  All the Made in Nature dried fruits are wonderful!	1
I love these figs!  Just the right gooeyness. Nice and sweet.  Highly recommended.  Thanks  ...  Ken	1
Yes! You should definitely try these. They're great :)  I picked them up while filling up my prime pantry box - I'm totally hooked. These are a great alternative to sweets. They did seem a bit pricey though - I'll compare with whole foods the next time i'm there.	1
These figs are delightful! So sweet and soft. I'll be buying these again. I recommend you try some, too.	1
We love basmatic rice and like the resealable bag.  Recommended. Organic is a plus	1
bueno	1
Good rice, not amazing. I guess I am not a rice connoisseur.	1
I have been buying several types of Lundberg rice for a long time.  The quality and flavor are always good and being grown organically in California are major reasons for choosing Lundberg.	1
great rice	1
Lindbergh Family Farms is the best! This is perfect rice.	1
So good.  Put in  with beef tips.  Yummy	1
Nice fluffy rice, non sticking, great price.	1
It's rice, it's tasty. What more?	1
this is really good and tasty	1
great	1
Thank you	1
This chili is nasty! I opened it, Took 1 bite couldn't stand it, fed it to my dog she loved it. Makes good dog food.	-1
ucky	-1
omg ew. I love the other Amy's soups, and I don't know what I expected this to be exactly, but it is what I think is scrambled tofu. It has a very off putting flavor.	-1
I will never buy this again, has a weird taste or perhaps a spice that does not belong in chili	-1
sounded so good, but didn't really like it	-1
okay	-1
Superior lack of flavor	-1
The first thing I noticed when I opened this soup was a strong onion odor.  When I heated it and tasted it there was an overwhelming onion flavor.  The consistency is not creamy smooth split pea puree but a chunky lumpy soup full of onions.  This is definitely not my idea of how a split pea soup should smell or taste.  I am trying to contact Amazon to send back the unopened second can I purchased.	-1
not very tastey	-1
awful stuff	-1
Can't taste any salt .  Don't like so much	-1
I did not like the taste or texture of this soup.	-1
TOO MANY CANS ARE DENTED !!!!  THIS CAN BE DANGEROUS !!!!	-1
In general this was well packaged etc. but I never expected that it would just be slices of apple with core, seeds, stem and all.  The edges were ok but the core was very hard and almost sharp,  Good flavor but I won't reorder	-1
Go with Campbells. I guess organic means bad aftertaste.	-1
TO SMALL	-1
As another person said, this is full of cores, seeds and stems.  They are okay the 1st time you eat some. After that they are stale. I do not recommend these.	-1
These are not for me. They have a very pungent apple flavor to them. If the flavor wasn't so pungent they would be fine but the flavor is a little bit of an overkill.	-1
I realize these are supposed to be a more healthy alternative to our favorite Goldfish, but no thank you.  They seem dry to the point that I had trouble swallowing them without something to drink, they definitely lack flavor and they are just plain bland.  Very disappointing compared to other Annie's products.	-1
I thought these would taste kind of like goldfish. They don't. They are extremely bland with almost no flavor st all.	-1
For me, these were somewhat dry and not really very tasty. I had lots of kids over and honestly, they would not eat them. I have had other Annie's products and liked them okay, but not these.	-1
Sorry, just didn't care much for them.	-1
One ounce is a small amount of anything but regret.  Be aware this bag is very small.	-1
kinda small ...	-1
yuck, no flavor, taste like salted cardboard	-1
not my favorite	-1
some of the chips were too hard to eat	-1
These were terrible and didn't finish eating the bag and just tossed them	-1
Chips are pretty good but this bag is not worth the price. there is nothing but crumbs in the bag. Its like a snack for a  toddler size.	-1
It's great texture, but the rest sort of falls flat.	-1
not worth 99 cents	-1
Tasted like crunchy tissue paper. Glad this was only one snack sized bag.	-1
mini mini	-1
Didn't like the flavor and I spent a lot of money on the 1 ounce. I guess I didn't read the description clear enough, but like others said, I feel a little duped.	-1
Dry and nearly tasteless with a cardboard-like texture.	-1
Tasted very bland. I did not like them.	-1
Small, small, tiny serving.	-1
My first 1 star review; These things are not good tasting it all. I didn't expect them to be as good as normal potato chips but at least tolerable enough to justify they are healthier.  Conclusion: I'd rather be fat and diabetic than suffer through eating these again.  I am actually glad the bag was small. The bag itself is about the size of those mini-chip bags you get for like 50 cents or so, you know the better tasting ones. Not only is the bag super small but it was only filled up about 20%, so overall I got maybe 10 chips in the whole bag for a little under $2.00. Complete rip-off.	-1
No taste and hard raisins	-1
Smallest bag ever for almost $2.	-1
It is difficult to know by the picture of the bag and the picture is the same on the larger bags.  Pay close attention to the oz size for all these pantry purchases.  Love the chips though.	-1
Not fresh.	-1
Terrible cereal.	-1
Can organic stuff taste good?  Not this one.	-1
They changed the formual on a product that was perfect. Have been drinking these for over a decade and this past shipment had an obvious different flavor. Searched all over to buy the orginial formula's to stock up on. Now I am stuck with over 50 or more of the new formula...will bring them to a food bank.	-1
I'll finish the box but it's really boring.  It's like eating a crunched up granola bar.	-1
The bag arrived with a giant tear in it, so baking soda had spilled out into the box. It was a nightmare to clean up and try to patch the hole so that I could make use of what was left. Not happy.	-1
Baking soda is baking soda. I use this for bath bombs and other cleaning stuff. Although, I went to Sams Club and found it for almost $6. Would not recommend someone to purchase this on here. Way to much.	-1
I use this baking soda regularly. It was the pricing that I found dislikable. I found the same product sold at SAM'S Club for a third of the price. I'll go to SAM'S next time.	-1
I bought this after reading the beaming reviews. I just don't like it. It doesn't taste like BBQ sauce to me. It tastes like very sour tomatoes. It's very odd and I don't like it.	-1
This was so bad I had to throw it out. Smelled like manure, and tasted like it too - I presume - never having drunk manure water.	-1
We used this ketchup in the restaurant I worked in. However, if you check out the ingredients, there is HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP in this ketchup. HFCS is NOT healthy for you. Heinz makes an organic ketchup WITHOUT high fructose corn syrup. Am switching to that ketchup. Amazon carries the organic non-HFCS Heinz ketchup if you are interested.  If you google HFCS, you will read about the health issues behind eating HFCS. Am surprised Heinz uses it in their popular ketchups.  Ingredients: Tomato Concentrate From Red Ripe Tomatoes, Distilled Vinegar, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Corn Syrup, Salt, Spice, Onion Powder, Natural Flavoring  Check out Heinz Organic Ketchup if you want to avoid the High Fructose Corn Syrup. It has only 4g of sugar per serving which is low. It is recommended that you don't go over 50g of added sugar a day by the World Health Organization, so 4g is acceptable.	-1
Arrived in Pantry Box with two of the packages crushed with apple sauce all over the inside.	-1
Gross tasting, I think it was rotten	-1
Delicious!  I gave them one star fir the non gmo baloney.  At some point people are going to outgrow their unfounded fears of gmos and these fear mongering companies will have mud on their faces for pandering to the fearful and sowing fear in the uninformed.	-1
This "Ketchup" if you can call it that should be Illegal. Wait it is illegal in Canada,Mexico and europe. The High Fructose corn syrup causes Brain damage, increases risk of diabetes, higher blood preasure. Heinz makes a natural ketchup, buy it instead. Also fight for our Government to get bigger so that we might have the same high food standards as MEXICO. Also if product wasent bad enough, it contains GMO's. DO YOU REALLY WANT YOUR KIDS EATING THIS?	-1
This product came with the bottom row seal not broken but 1 cup is 1/3 fill and other 2 3/4 full top ones ok	-1
smashed	-1
kids prefer the version with sugar	-1
Wasn't sweet enough for our taste.	-1
Came as one big clump.	-1
Every single can I ordered of Cento tomatoes were dented, severely	-1
I hate to pay the price of Organic anything.  I have raised enough gardens and other crops to know that you have to kill insects to raise good quality crops.  I truly wish Amazon would carry good quality canned tomatoes and other vegetables that were not Organic.	-1
The taste of the tomatoes is as close to perfect as they can get. The cans however were extremely dented and rusty. What a shame that I can't rate them higher. If it were just for the taste, they'd get 5*. But I'm tired of the rusty dented cans. Won't buy canned products from amazon anymore. Too bad.	-1
I'm cleaning up an older relative's kitchen and trying to establish if it is safe to eat their products. They don't have dates on the products I am looking at. Cento doesn't answer the customer service phone, you speak to a machine. If you have a question like is this safe to eat you are out of luck.  You leave a message and might as might as well tie a note to a squirrel and let it loose in the woods. Cento customer service apparently doesn't care about your familys safety enough to get back to you.	-1
Very expensive.  Didn't realize the local gourmet store was half the price.	-1
These tomatoes are mushy with a dollop of sauce on the top.  They're sweet with a modicum of tomato flavor-not at all what I expected.  If I bought these at Kroger I'd take 'em back.  The price is right but I have bought store-brand tomatoes that are better than these.	-1
Too fibrous to ear it its entirety. Very disappointed.	-1
I bought this to fill in on an Amazon Pantry order.  It was a most bought item so I thought I would try it.  I like cooking with artichokes and the price was right.  I tasted one out of the can and some of the outer leaves were still spiky on the ends....so I had to check each  one and most of them had to have some of the petals taken off.  The remaining pieces were good but it sure was a lot of work for canned artichokes.  I think in the future, I will spend more and save prep work time.	-1
Artichoke hearts are a food I have enjoyed often, so I ordered these to have some delivered. The appearance was not something I have seen before, or the healthy colors as pictured on the can. I will not purchase these again because I didn't like the appearance or the texture. I threw away a lot of it because of dark grey around the edges of the pieces.	-1
Don't know how the artichokes were because the can was severely dented so I did not open it.	-1
Great product and was my primary source of daily drinking water. Then Prime Pantry started putting buying limits on the product and now doesn't seem to offer at all.	-1
I react to this product because the scent is overwhelming and is chemically based, not natural lemon. I'm sure its fine for cleansing and dishes, but if you do have any chemical sensitivity like I do, be careful of this.	-1
I hate that I have to pull out scissors to open each packet plus it didn't always dissolve. Will not purchase again.	-1
It taste better than other brand named canned pineapples. That is the 2 stars. If I wanted to eat the core I would have bought a whole pineapple. Approximately 18% of each bite is hard core. I will not cut off the core on each tiny bite.  So much for the recipe I purchased this for. At the price they want I feel ripped off. Find your pineapple elsewhere.	-1
Not worth the price. Dole is a better buy	-1
Doesn't -technically- contains SLS, but it has similarly drying and sudsing ingredients. I adore tea tree oil and its scent, but this doesn't smell like tea tree, it smells chemical-y and artificial-citrus-y. Like Lysol, which isn't how I'd prefer to smell. Also much harsher and stripping than typical "SLS-free" shampoos.	-1
Doesn't work for my fine thin greyish hair. Weighs hair down.	-1
Really dries out my hair and scalp. Had to switch to another brand	-1
not as expected.	-1
Love the smell. Hate that my scalp had a reaction and it gave me a rash.	-1
The cans were banged up, and as you may know... It is therefore, unsafe to consume it.	-1
is like a can of water with half a bouillon of chicken flavor and sparse of any actual chicken or anything really.  might be good starter to make your own soup with which is how i ended up using it.	-1
Very light on contents. Maybe 7..10% food, but this is mainly BROTH. I would not buy again. Unless you want broth, you'll be hungry after eating a whole can, which will be maybe 5 bites of solids. I was surprised by the brand name being so empty!	-1
My personal taste...yuck	-1
i was dissapointed thought this would be good and nope it was not	-1
no disrespect Wolfgang...Sorry the soup is very bland and over priced .  Campbell s soup still has the best taste for the pallet	-1
Not sure I got this.	-1
Glue stays on skin when band-aid is removed, and bandaid shreds while you're wearing it. Then when peeled off, it rips into pieces. Weird- I love all the other bandages but these are faulty.	-1
This band-aids stays on very well...too well.  They will stay in an area that flexes, which can often pop off other band-aids, but when it comes time to get them off you will have a painful struggle.  They pull and irritate the skin big time and leave glue behind.  They are tough strips, as in tough on your skin.  I couldn't imagine using these on skin that has hair on it, as it would pull all the hair out...ouch!  There needs to be a good balance between a band-aid's ability to stay on and your ability to get it off again without a lot of pain.  This one falls too far to the former side.  Or they need to put a note on the box that says you need to use some kind of alcohol to get the band-aid off again.	-1
a bit harsh on the mouth.	-1
it has bad ingridients	-1
tastes worse than bad breath	-1
Left my hair lifeless, barely any scent.	-1
Doesn't detangle or silken my hair.  Won't buy again.	-1
Leaves my hair feeling crusty/dry like there's residual product after rinsing. I've found that vinegar leaves my hair way softer than any fancy botanicals..	-1
Left my hair lifeless. Barely any scent.	-1
Twice now the soup has gone bad long before the expiration date.  I suspect the new lid/seal mechanism is not air tight enough.	-1
Tomato soup from a can (store brand) is better.	-1
Tasted watered down. Other brand at warehouse club was much better and good price.	-1
Disappointed in this lavender and chamomile soap. Good detect only a faint scent of lavender. Fine lather, etc. as any Softsoap but definitely not lavender!	-1
Among the scent and cleaning power I like it.  Why the price went up $1.20 this month I don't like...	-1
Bought two and both pumps do not work. Has happened before too. Something wrong with their design as I have bought off brands and never have a problem.	-1
The flavor is no that of normal sugar. It's not good for cooking or in my coffee.	-1
BIG granules, and to flavored not to alter the flavor of whatever you use it for, especially coffee or tea. Baking is probably fine.	-1
ok	-1
Too watered down. Taste not bad but too runny.	-1
There is such a small amount of tuna in these pouches...ridiculous. Not enough to make one man-size sandwich.  I won't be purchasing again.	-1
So I bought this thinking it was normal tuna.  Nope.  White tuna is not normal tuna.  Its creepy and I don't like it.	-1
I did not like this soup.  It was almost all broth with very little substance.  The taste was just average.	-1
Waste of Money..this is disgusting...I just opened the first can and it is LITERALLY nothing more than "boiled water" with about a tablespoon of freaking rice,,,a couple of slices of carrot...and totally TASTELESS !! I mean, is he kidding.  Really, I had to add salt, pepper,  spices  drink the d$%@@ thing because it is nothing but colored water.....without exaggeration folks!  I want my money back...god !!	-1
You pay fora name.  Lower sodium is the best thing I can say about it.  The contents are sparse and this can of soup is one bowl only, not condensed.  Disappointed for the money...	-1
Very bland tasting. I won't buy again.	-1
Mostly broth. Very little edible content. Left me hungry and feeling taken advantage of. I bought a name and got mostly a can of broth.	-1
My personal taste...yuck	-1
Flavorless	-1
low in flavo	-1
So when this soup first hit the market about a decade ago it blew my mind. It had nice big bits of chicken in it, and was loaded with vegetables and rice. The flavor was mind blowing full of herbs tasted better than fresh homemade soup, in fact for years I have tried with my homemade soups to get the same amazing sage flavor that was in this canned soup and have failed.  I loved this soup and then it was gone, couldn't find it anywhere anymore.  I was so happy when I found this on Amazon. It came I opened the box heated up a can right away and was so disappointed.  There are hardly any pieces of chicken in it now, seriously there were like two pieces of chicken in the first can I opened. Hardly any veg, except for tons of nice cheap carrots, how do I know carrots are cheap, because that's what this is a can of carrots. There is not even much rice in it. Worst of all the flavor is gone, no more amazing herby greatness, just kind of a watered down version of it's former self.  It went from being an amazing product to being substandard, It's not even on the same level as Campbell's or Progresso anymore.  Sad.	-1
Where's the CHICKEN!!!  I am so glad I decided to try this for myself before adding to a gift basket for friends. It's very tacky and poor quality for organic food with a well known chef's endorsement. UGH!  and my final thought...it would be poor quality with a generic label.	-1
Yuck.	-1
We've been using this detergent for a few years now and couldn't figure out why some of our laundered clothes smelled so bad when worn.  I did a test by smelling them straight from the washer vs fresh out of the dryer using a dryer sheet. The clothes from the dryer smelled great but the wet clothes smelled bad. Not disgustingly bad just slightly unpleasant. After air drying some of the laundry and putting it in a drawer for a week they smelled much worse.  For a long time I thought the smell came from one of my dresser drawers (the one I put delicates in that I air dry) and began buying some products that you put in your drawers to take away musty smells. They didn't help much.  Needless to say I won't be buying this product any longer.	-1
I do read reviews. Usually, if a product has a positive rating with a great amount of persons, I feel safe in trying it. I know, my opinion might be different, but I feel that I can't be THAT disappointed. I usually do not use negative reviews for fear of sounding like some that do so, but it is cleatr that they are condeming a product for something that it did not claim or was supposed to DO! If I see an abundance of negative feedback, I will mostly always pay heed, and DON'T even GO there. I know this scored high, but off all of the cheap 2.00 detergents I have ever used.....this is HORRIBLE and it WASN'T inexpensive. I tried it because of the name, and I am trying to be more Earth conserving recycling conscious in EVERY product that I use. I was surprised at how much is "lathered/soaped" when using a little to wash in sink...and it LASTED. However, after letting something soak, that was not really visably too dirty, it looked a bit WORSE. I thought, ok maybe it is my imagination so I repeated the same thing 3 more times....now seemed to show soiled areas MORE! After I hung to dry....it did not smell "fresh" even though it did when I hung to dry! This has NEVER happened before. I will admit  I DO like things to at LEAST SMELL clean, even though I am sure some detergents are misleading in this way. Well, this one was....after drying NO SMELL and item appeared to maybe be more soiled after soaking in sink for HOURS.	-1
Really love this detergent! But the size of the container at the price I paid was not right. For that price I should have gotten a full size, instead we got a tiny bottle.	-1
It was good detergent, but I won't buy it again.	-1
I need to clarify what I hate.  I do not hate the product -- I hate the damages of the product.  This is the second time I have ordered liquid cleaning products and each time the bottles have been dented and the products have run out all over the other food products in the box.  When taking the detergent out of the shipping box, I got detergent all over my shoes and floor.  The shipping boxes are very sturdy and there are no punctures or damages in the exterior of the boxes so I was very surprised to see the damages of the merchandise.	-1
This detergent does a fine job cleaning clothes, but, I'm SUPER smell sensitive, and I thought it would be more natural smelling... it's NOT! I gave it to my mom, who doesn't have smell sensitivities, and even she said it smells like "old lady perfume" in her garage after doing a load of laundry.  It works well, is good for the environment, and if you like super perfumy smelling clothes, you'll LOVE this detergent!	-1
This product did not work for me at all, i tried cleaning different products and surfaces but it did not clean well.	-1
Came frozen	-1
I love Fiji. It's normally great water and I'll continue to buy it from retailers, but not online. My Fiji water shipment contained water that seemed old like it sat around in a warehouse for a while. I'd return it but it's just too much of a hassle (and my wife angrily dumped all the bad water and recycled the bottles). Maybe people don't order this too often and we got an old batch, but I won't buy it through Amazon again, not at least this size.	-1
Come on, people!  This is a complete rip off!  Paying at over $36 for only 12 bottles at 50.7 ounces apiece is paying over $3 for not even a HALF gallon!!  If you buy at this price you are paying over $6 for a single gallon of FUJI water!!  Outrageous!!  DON'T BE A FOOLISH SUCKER!!  DO NOT BUY AT THIS CRIMINAL PRICE!  There are much better deals for water that tastes just as good.	-1
Milk in order exploding ruining this, unable to determine quality.	-1
Family did not like it.	-1
If you like the old el paso enchilada sauce do NOT buy this. This is the most file disgusting crap I have ever had the displeasure of using in the kitchen it was watery, nasty tasting, nothing I did made it taste ok at all it was absolutely the most disgusting thing I have ever used. It sucks.	-1
I bought about 30 boxes of this pasta.  Before I got through a third of them I began to find boxes infested with insects that  looked to me like flour beetles.  Of course, this infestation could have started in my pantry, but I have been buying and storing pasta for reasonable  periods of time and never had this problem before.  If the boxes were sealed well,  this should not happen locally as I never use partial packages.  I do not mind eating sphagetti with beetles, but my wife refuses  to do this, so it  looks like my chickens will enjoy the pasta with this beetle  sauce.	-1
gets messy on the top, won't order again	-1
I bought this for my husband because he wanted to try a new toothpaste. We were both very surprised to find that it is spearmint flavored, which I hate. It isn't mentioned anywhere on the bottle or in the description. I think that I, along with most people, associate green with spearmint, so I assumed that the blue packaging meant that this was the minty flavor of most toothpastes. That was an incorrect assumption. It's also thin and runny and kind of soaks into your toothbrush, instead of sitting on top of it. The consistency grossed my husband out and I don't think he'll be using it again. The one thing we did like was that the shape of the container makes it easier to store than traditional tubes of toothpaste.	-1
defective and packaging was horrible	-1
Only ordered can - not a sack	-1
I do not like these sponges at all!  I thought I would give them a try bc my regular sponges were not offerered in Amazon prime. The "scrubber" part is awful!  It barely works from the start, and completely falls apart after minimal usage. Then you are left picking up little green pieces all over your dishes. These are also not as think as other sponges. I will never buy again. Horrible!	-1
Scrubby surface began to peel off the sponge within about 2 weeks. Won't re-order.	-1
I have used many brands of sponges in the past and I am sure I have used this brand before. But this time the sponges I received came apart a lot faster than normal. The green part separated from the sponge early on in its life.	-1
Band-aid bix all ripped and instead of 80 only 71 arrived!!!	-1
Are the walnuts? Are they diamonds? No, they are cashews	-1
Usable but broken up.	-1
Mini wheats are usually quite good. This flavor was on sale and bought a bunch. I regret it. If you want something that barely has any flavor go and get this. Its like Pepto Bismol over grains. I thought it was just me until I saw someone else pour a bowl and try to eat it then immediately get up to dump the bowl. After the recall right after getting this we threw it all out. [...]	-1
These band-aids are garbage. These shred when trying to take them off the skin, making them hard to remove.	-1
Beware, the chemical poison BHT included in small dosages as a way of preserving this item.  enough bht buildup can damage your body and or worse.  Most countries make it illegal for companies to sell foods containing bht.  the USA is one of the few that put the businesses before it's citizens and allow for such misconduct.  hopefully you will read this and think seriously about yours families health and start paying attention to what is foods	-1
Is there anything inside of these? I feel like I got a placebo pack. No results at all. I've used this brand before and liked it. But somehow, nothing.	-1
So thin and sticks to fingers trying to put on	-1
These bandaids do stay on the skin for a long time, but the material is so thin that when I try to pull the tabs off to apply it to the skin, the bandaid rips. I'm not sure if the adhesive was attached to the plastic covers too long and it made it harder to get off, but I have ripped several bandaids.	-1
These are a bit flexible but not fabric. plastic band aid and will leave your skin sticky.	-1
What happened?! Is this the Band-Aid brand rejects? So far half of these that we used either stretched apart while opening, or had little to no stick to them. Come on Band-aid, you can do better! Go for the cloth type or waterproof ones if you are going to buy band-aid brand.	-1
Tasted like hard cardboard. Not good at all.	-1
not very tasty	-1
Lacks flavor. Does not meet the standards of the usual Quaker breakfast products.	-1
Fairly	-1
I didn't care much for these. It's the texture.	-1
Tastes good, but too sweet. Glycemic index for this cereal must be sky high, judging from it's effects. I'll stick with cheerios or Quaker oatmeal.	-1
Box  arrived crushed, with cereal in the box and package torn open.	-1
About 60/65% Peanuts so it is grossly over priced.  The Almonds are of all sizes with bits and pieces about25/30%.  There are a few Cashew bits and pieces and I found four parts and two small halves of Pecan and two small Brazil Nuts.  I found only one of each of the other nuts listed.  I will never purchase "Planters Mixed Nuts' again.	-1
I've kept a bottle of Tabasco (the original blend) in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit. I've added a few drops to any number of dishes that I wanted to "kick up" a notch and used it regularly in a Bloody/Virgin Mary.  I'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently.  After purchasing and taste testing over 40 different hot sauces (everyone needs a hobby), writing up notes, test tasting them blind again - writing up new notes and then comparing my old versus new notes  ----- I have to say Tabasco's original blend turns out to be one of the worse hot sauces I have tested.  Tabasco's original has only two tastes: hot peppers combined with a very heavy dose of vinegar. The bitter vinegar after-taste, so typical in Tabasco's original, is not an inherent quality of a good hot sauce.  I could provide an extensive list of hot sauces that are far superior to Tabasco's original but here are just a few that are widely available: I encourage you to try any or all of them. I'm very certain you will be pleasantly surprised.  1) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (as potent as Tabasco) but with far less vinegar with a hint of sugar and garlic. Available in most supermarkets. Praised in many reviews and rightly so. Look for a large bottle with a rooster on the label.  2) Cholula Hot Sauce (milder and less vinegar) - often highly rated by professional reviewers and available in most supermarkets. Look for the wooden top.  3) Tabasco's own Chipotle blend (much milder - rich tasting) featuring the chipotle smoked pepper -less vinegar - widely available  I hope I've encouraged you to try a few other hot sauces.  PS: Once you get away from Tabasco's (original) hot sauce and what I find to be its excessive vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are so many superior hot sauces available that it is almost hard to comprehend. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco first came to market. While Tabasco likes to brag that this is their original blend ---- that is not a "plus" in my view but rather a "minus" - a marketing gimmick where they argue that an inherent flaw (a lot of vinegar) is an attribute. BTW: Less anyone think I have an axe to grind with Tabasco - see my review of Tabasco's Chipotle hot sauce which I rated as excellent!  What more can I say - experiment - I sincerely doubt you will stick with Tabasco's original hot sauce.  UPDATE (August 2013): While my review was written over a year before - just recently (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS, TESTED HOT SAUCES.   What sauce came in very LAST?  Tabasco!   What was first?  Huy Fong Sriracha.  I'll admit it is nice to have a professional tasting panel come to the very same conclusions I arrived at a year earlier.  Tastes vary of course	-1
I've kept a bottle of Tabasco in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit.  I've used it in Bloody Marys and added a few drops to many dishes I wanted to "kick up" a notch.  I'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently. Huge mistake!  After a bit of taste testing I have to say Tabasco is one of the worse hot sauces available. Cayenne Pepper and a lot vinegar are Tabasco's major flavor notes. You can do much better! You won't miss all that bitter vinegar!  I could provide a long list of hot sauces that are much better. Here are just a few and I choose them because they are all widely distributed (sold here on Amazon and in your supermarket): Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce,  Cholula Hot Sauce, and Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce are all far superior. There are many others  Once you get away from Tabasco and its bitter vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are a lot of superior hot sauces. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco was first developed.  Update (August 2013): While my review was written some time ago - just recently (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS tested a wide number of hot sauces. What sauce came in last? Tabasco! First was the Huy Fong Sriracha.	-1
Sugar and lard are un necessary ingredients in peanut butter.	-1
This is THE Skippy Superchunk, and still tastes amazing.  What I have a problem with is the price, which is $6..95 at Walmart.  Why is it so ridiculously expensive here?	-1
This was not less than 50% peanuts, more like 50+% regular peanuts	-1
Nothing good about this cereal	-1
I bought a box for old time's sake, but it'll probably be the last time I do so. I guess I forgot how bad the ingredients were, or perhaps I didn't pay that much attention when I was younger. Saturated fats, preservatives, and corn syrup... yuck. And it doesn't taste as good as I remember either, it's way too sweet! Is it really so hard to make a cereal that doesn't have so much unnecessary toxic junk in it?	-1
As if getting fiber in your diet isn't tough enough, this cereal is unappetizing and looks like dog food.	-1
Not as fresh as the ones I get at the local store.	-1
I used to LOVE Cracklin' Oat bran. Kelloggs ruined it with tropical oils.	-1
I love Mac nuts, but these under delivered. They were sorta tasteless  although they are sweet but finish sort of oily. I found that their Chocolate product actually tastes great, and plain mac nuts are also yummy. But these just didn't have it.	-1
These raisins were very dry and seedy. They did not taste fresh and seemed shelf stale.	-1
Too much GMO sugar!	-1
Didnt think it would be so small	-1
Very disappointing.  Tastes stale and is very dry and crumbly.  I can't even eat it because it crumbles into bits and becomes powdery, causing me to choke.	-1
No good it is too thin	-1
The 56oz can of "mixed nuts" consists of almost entirely very tiny peanut halves and almonds	-1
This is non-stick?? Well, it sure sticks to bbq ribs. Not worth the price or claims.	-1
stale	-1
Hello, The product I came was not like the photo, is very similar but not the same that I bought , just consume it, but not the same Offered in the page.	-1
Damaged goods box smelled like pickles and glass  all in it	-1
This stuff is junk.  Never clings properly and always comes unpeeled.	-1
I've often wondered why I went to the solid white Albacore instead of this slurry.  Now I remember.	-1
Yup. The other reviewers are right. This is basically tuna soup. My booty is chunkier than this tuna by far!  That being written, this is okay for tuna casserole or fried tuna cakes but forget making tuna sammiches out of this hot mess. No wuh-hay!	-1
We ate these by the bagful while we were on vacation in Hawaii. I got home and was still craving them so I ordered, and Mauna Loa is the same brand we got in Hawaii. Maybe they don't travel well or something because they were not as flavorful nor fresh as the bags we bought on the island.	-1
Over the years "Tuna" has changed. What use to be "Chunk" is now a "paste" of mashed tuna meat and "other stuff" inside the tuna....and sometimes "soy" or other "stuff". The tuna "paste" is referred to as "tuna rendering or sludge" in the industry. It is pumped as a a liquid through the packaging process. Anytime you see the words "Chunk Light" this means a "sludge" mixture of tuna particles and "stuff" in either an oil or water solution. Its all about MONEY and how cheaply this company can get CHINESE tuna and "stuff" mashed up and into a can. That is enough for me to never buy a can of this product. See attached picture from the Bumble Bee website.	-1
its not chunk	-1
The Heart Healthy Mix is overwhelmingly peanuts ... in more ways than one. I haven't picked a pinch out of the bag yet that didn't have at least one peanut in it, and the taste of the peanuts overwhelms the tastes of any other nuts ... even if I eat them separately, they still have absorbed the strong taste of the peanuts.  I like peanuts, and I like the taste of peanuts, but I do not like my pecans and pistachios, walnuts and hazelnuts, and almonds to taste like peanuts.  Nor do I like paying pecan, pistachio, walnut, hazelnut, and almond prices for peanuts.  If you don't like that also, best give the Heart Healthy Mix a miss --- try the Wholesome Nut Mix instead.	-1
there was over 85 percent peanuts	-1
What happened to the Planters Product?  These nuts are tiny, very small. PLANTERS, has see the last of my dollars. I ordered two cans, the price seemed fair, little did I know. Very disappointed in the quality of this product... I rarely post negative but I could not in good conscience let this slide.  The only reason I gave it one star is regardless of size or quality, they are mixed nuts.	-1
They should call these "overpriced stale peanuts with a couple other nuts mixed in". Total disappointment. 90% stale peanuts.	-1
I didn't like this all that well because there were far too many peanuts and not enough other nuts.	-1
I bought these for the mix of nuts.  And you get a mix of nuts, but EVERYTHING tastes like peanuts.  Pecans taste like peanuts, filberts taste like peanuts, etc.  You can barely tell one kind of nuts from another.  I won't be buying these again.	-1
stale	-1
Salty too many peanuts!	-1
I was pretty mad when I got this to find that they were not blue. The ones I got were red. If they are not going to look like the picture they should say so! I needed the blue to match the dcor I wanted so this was very disappointing. Otherwise they are your standard solo cup.	-1
Disappointing mix of nuts overall. Bought 4 of these, and have opened 3 so far. The cans are probably 90%+ Peanuts and Almonds. My wife likes Brazil nuts most, and in the first container there was only 2 of them. The second container had ZERO. The third container had 3 and 1/2 of them. Extremely disappointing. For Pecans there have been an average of 8-10 halves per can. Cashews have a bit more, maybe around 20 of them per can.  Overall the nuts have a good flavor. A lot of the almonds are toasted well, and the flavor really comes through. Just don't buy these cans unless you are fine getting mostly Peanuts and Almonds. Picking out a Cashew or Pecan is a pleasant surprise, not a regular occurrence. And if you manage to find a Brazil nut it's like finding one of Wonka's Golden Tickets.	-1
This is the third can I've ordered and the quality is poor. The first can was fine although it contained mostly almonds. The second can was great with a good assortment with a clean appearance and good taste. In the third can about half of the nuts were broken and many just small fragments of their original size. Bits of nut skins covering the nuts gave a very dirty appearance although they didn't affect the overall taste. The nuts didn't have a 'fresh' taste and came across as a bit stale. Planters doesn't seem to have any quality control on it's products and I'll be ordering from another company.	-1
HARD AS ROCKS!	-1
What has happened to Planters quality?  I used to buy these and get a really good mix of peanuts, almonds, brazil nuts, filberts, pecans, and cashews.  No more.  My can was well over half peanuts -- more like 75-80%.  I got ** 4** brazil nuts, maybe 8 or 10 filberts, a few pecans (mostly small pieces), a healthy handful of almonds, and NO cashews that I could find, unless they were in pieces that look like peanuts.  I certainly didn't taste any.  Overly salty, too.  Just not worth it.  Will purchase only "premium" nut blends at the supermarket in the future.  Sorry.	-1
I was probably one of the first fans of Press 'n Seal.  I still think Press 'n Seal plastic is far superior to plastic wrap.  Lately though, it seems the box it comes in is so cheap, that I am frustrated to the core trying to get the Press 'n Seal out.  The two end caps that hold the roll in fell out.  Now, I have a plastic roll with nothing to hold it in the box.  If I grab the roll to try and unroll, I end up pressing on the roll and the Press 'n Seal starts sealing to itself right there on the roll!  I almost had a wad of Press 'n Seal I couldn't use.  Every time I unroll it, I have to be extra careful not to do that.	-1
While these were fresh they are almost all peanuts and almonds. The picture shows big pecans. They were not in the cans I received. I just got two or three broken pieces. I will start buying the kind of nuts I like without almond fillers.	-1
Very sticky in the roll making it almost impossible to pull out without squeezing the box. (Squeezing the box will result in increased adhesion of wrap in the roll.) Good idea but execution less than good. Will not reorder.	-1
I orginally purchased this because of an idea I saw on pinterest: to line the shelves of our fridge to help ease with the clean up of the crumbs and spills. It doesnt stick. It doesnt stick to plastic, glass or anything else, other than itself. Ugh. Will most likely toss it. Great idea, poor quality product.	-1
Sort of sweet and gets soggy in milk pretty quickly. I got it because it was on sale and was relatively lower in fat, but wouldn't buy again unless really really inexpensive.	-1
Prefer regular wrap.	-1
It is filled with soy. My stomach can't handle food made with soy.	-1
I received the product defective. It would have been better if someone inspected the shipments better to avoid issues like this.	-1
Do not like.  To hard to deal with	-1
Works well but leaves a sticky residue on your dishes that is impossible to clean, even if you have a dishwasher. Will not be purchasing again.	-1
Gross, you get these rock-hard pieces of I don't know what that you can't even chew. Taste is ok, it's the texture that makes this inedible to me.	-1
Absolutely nothing like Glad Wrap or Saran Wrap. This Is Awful. Doesn't stick to regualr plastic bowls, not a great seal on food, either. I wish I never wasted the money on this. If you want Glad Wrap or Saran Wrap, buy that, and not this instead.	-1
This plastic wrap is almost impossible to get out of the box, very hard to use. I gave it two stars instead of one because it does cling once you can wrestle a piece out of the box. I wont' buy it again. What an annoying and hard to use product.	-1
My error...texture of produce very disappointing. I should have researched more	-1
This was my first and last experience with Glad Press and Seal Plastic Wrap. I have used many brands including Glad' s plastic wrap.(original). That can be a little bit of a challenge to use at times.  This stuff however, is like using extra wide Duct Tape. It doesn't want to pull away from the rest of the roll. The box fell apart as I was trying to get it started.  When I finally got some off I found while it will stay where you put it okay.  It doesn't want to re-seal onto the item you put it on. Meaning I had to use a whole new piece to cover my food again. Doing so deposits twice the residue from the adhesive. On glass or plastic it's hard to get off worse if it's textured  This lead me to be very frustrated and displeased with the performance of this product.  As I find it costs much more than Glad plastic wrap and does much less in comparison. For this reason I can't recommend this product to others.	-1
I just did not care for the blandness of these .	-1
With the ever long race to reduce prices. It seems they have cut the amount of cinnamon used in this. There is only a slight hint of a cinnamon taste to it. I doubt I will buy this again, any time soon.	-1
If you want something that barely has any flavor go and get this. A few years back I could taste the cinnamon and have a bit of background sweetness. This version is not it. I am giving up cereal. Gone are the days of actual flavor. I hate to pass this on to others but better off giving it to someone else than wasting it.	-1
Box smashed	-1
Too sweet. Threw it out	-1
if you want to pay full price for a sample.. I had to laugh when I took this out of box.. I buy the Biggest jar of Nutella from the store for 3.68.. this jar cost me 3.something close to big jar's price. They do not even sell this jar in the stores..I truly believe it is a sample.. Its a joke ..thats what it is!	-1
these pads will be nice for pans with stick, work great	-1
Don't Like It. It Has A Bad Smell. Does Not Clean Well. Not Worth The Price	-1
Didn't like this but that is just me	-1
When you buy a nut spread, and the nuts are the THIRD item in the ingredient list, you have a problem!  You just bought yourself a bunch of sugar and palm oil!  The way they tried to market this as "healthy" is just silly!!	-1
Yucky	-1
Really not a fan of packaged mashed potatoes.  It is definitly better to just go buy fresh potatoes and make them from scratch.  It may be a little more work but when done right it beat the packaged potatoes everyday.	-1
so do	-1
the worst flavor and over sweetened stuff ever!	-1
The reason I am a soda addict is because; Colas use a different type of caffeine (possibly Caffeine citrate?) and the cola nut.) Colas do not affect the nervous system like coffee. Coffee makes me nervous, shaky and has other side effects. Colas do not make me nervous...  Zevia uses coffee as the source of caffeine. Cannot drink it. I also do not like Stevia sweetener. Makes my system feel 'off'.  Please, someone out there make a true natural cola without coffee. Keep the main ingredients but NO sweeteners, no aspartame, no sugar, no fructose.., no coffee, no tea. We can add our own choice of sweetener.  Also tried that new soda making machine. No good! Ingredients loaded with chemicals, sulfites that cause migraines. No option to add my own choice of sweetener; forced to use high fructose corn syrup or aspartame...  Do we have to make our own truly natural sodas?! I am learning and will be free of all you guys someday!	-1
My wife and I were thrilled when we heard that there was a soda with Stevia used for a sweetner, instead of dangerous Aspartame or other artificial sweetners.  We went down to our local health food store, where we purchased several different flavors of 'Zevia', including their cola.  Imagine our surprise when we read one of the ingredients listed as erythritol, a sugar alcohol!  And then we learned that it very well could be made from GMO (genetically modified) corn!  Our quest for a truly natural, non GMO, stevia only soda continues!	-1
I bought this product as an alternative to other diet sodas (the "big two" will remain nameless) mainly because I wanted to get away from the aspartame artificial sweetener. I've heard "bad things" about aspartame but after doing my own research on it I couldn't find any conclusive research or studies proving it was as bad as people claimed. There are tons of sites that say all these bad things it does to you, but nobody can give me a single study proving any of what they say. I tend to think this thing against aspartame is more of a conspiracy then anything else.  But regardless, I decided to lower my intake of aspartame and try this Zevia, since it's sweetened with Stevia. The taste is certainly lacking and while it doesn't taste horrible, when comparing it to the major players in the industry - it stinks. A very bland taste and there is very little carbonation.  Did I mention it gave me horrible gas and bloating? You know the kind that sits with you all day long and just gives you an unsettled stomach? The reason for this is that it has a sugar alcohol in it called "erythritol" and if you know anything about sugar alcohols, they almost always give you an upset stomach, gas, and/bloating. Sugar alcohols are what those sugar free, low carb chocolates have in them. And while wikipedia states that this sugar alcohol "shouldn't" be as bad as the other more notorious ones, like xylitol, because none of it "supposedly" reaches the large intestine...let's just say I would disagree.  If aspartame is so bad for you then why is that these products sweetened with stevia cause discomfort in some people? You'd think the "bad" product would be the one where you actually notice the side effects. At $1 a can (compare that to less then 30 cents a can for other cola brands), coupled with the potential unwanted discomfort, I think you might wanna stay away from this product.	-1
These rice bars are absolutely disgusting. I couldn't even finish one out of the whole box and I've tried to fob them off on friends, but  no one else likes them either. Yuck.	-1
My daughter would eat these after first bite.	-1
Maybe it's just my tastes. I'm pretty picky about chocolate tastes. I couldn't get myself to even finish a bar, but I gave the rest of the box to my father and he didn't have anything negative to say (though he also didn't ask for more either)	-1
WAY TOO SWEET!  I wanted something organic instead of Heinz and decided to try this.  It tastes syrupy and we just threw away the whole bottle.  It was a bad experience for sure.	-1
I hate this ketchup. I never thought I would say something so heartless about the wonder that is ketchup. This has like cloves and a few other spices that just make my mouth feel icky! It's a weird flavor and I don't like it! I actually threw it out after attempting to use it a couple of times. My husband doesn't like it either and he has VERY different tastes from me. I do not recommend buying this (obviously).	-1
Little one got sick of these quickly.... NO FIBER.... I should have checked the ingredients first	-1
The filling was too sweet. The outside was nearly tasteless and like gooey cardboard-yuk!	-1
Very crummy and dry. You might find a better option than these if you are looking for a way for your toddler not to get messy.	-1
Not much fruit in them, you can barely see it much less taste the fruit	-1
Much better deal at Costco - I was shocked when I opened-up my prime delivery box and saw how small the box was	-1
package was damaged- box was like wet and falling apart at the borrom	-1
Paid $$17.88 w/tax for Nature's Path Organic Flax Plus Pumpkin Granola Cereal, 11.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)  I do not recommend buying: I did not like the taste and how crunch it felt. The only reason I bought this was due to the $10 Citi promo otherwise, I will not be buying this again.	-1
This is not very good for anyone A Organic cereal isn't all bad for you , huh?pumpkin and flax seeds pack 5 g of fiber and 6 g of protein as well as 450 mg of omega-3 fatty acids per -cup serving. But think about this it at 260 calories, 10 g of fat (1.6 g saturated), and 10 g of sugar, it's far from the best choice to start your day!	-1
its hard as a rock, and it taste ok.  My baby is teething but he seems to not care for it and he eats everything but that.	-1
My son wouldn't eat these and when I tried them I knew why. They taste like cardboard.	-1
My baby wouldn't eat this product, and neither would the dog. My baby liked holding the teething biscuit but she wouldn't actually chew on it for more than a few seconds. She dropped it on the floor and our dog usually eats most things, but he sniffed it and then moved on.	-1
I wanted to like this product because it is supposed to be healthier. I didn't. Flakes were too big to be used for anything. Not a fan and won't be ordering again. Ended up throwing it out.	-1
It's sweet, packed with seeds that get stuck in your throat, doesn't taste at all of pumpkin, and filling after a couple teaspoons. Wouldn't buy again.	-1
Maybe my expectations were wrong because I thought this coconut was awful.  I love Bob's product and thought I would try this coconut, since it had great reviews.  I thought it was dry and lacked flavor so I sent it back.	-1
I ordered this unsweetened coconut to use in a homemade trail mix.  I love fresh coconut, but not the work involved, so I thought this would be the next-to-best thing.  The coconut is almost tasteless.  I now have 3 1/2 bags left that I will probably never use.  Anyone want to buy 3 unopened bags of tasteless coconut?	-1
I thought that this flaked coconut would be finer, maybe more shredded..I didn't mind the fact it was unsweetened, but I found it did not have much flavor and it  was much larger pieces.. more like it was chipped.. and I really don't know what to do with it now that I have it..Don't think I will order it again..	-1
Lots of mess in this bag.  I got tired of trying to take out dark, damaged pieces.  The rice was maybe old and much crumbled easily and didn't cook well.  I threw out the rest of the bag.  Maybe I got the bottom of a barrel here but it's not the first time this brand has really let me down.  I think of myself as being able to make sushi rice fairly consistently, but not with this brand.  I hate spending an hour picking through a few cups of rice before it's washed and then finding so much more in the process of washing it.  It makes me dread cooking the rice and makes for a sore neck and back in the process.	-1
It says light sodium, we received it and it was 530 sodium. For someone that has kidney disease we have to watch the sodium. and that is not light at all. so I will donate it.	-1
Product had no taste.  Felt as if I were eating soft cardboard.  Needed more spices	-1
Tastes like poop. I have to eat low sodium products, but I expet them to be a lot tastier than this stuff.	-1
This is awful. Somehow it's sweet and it tastes like nothing. It smells like onion, even though there doesn't appear to be any onion in it. I thought it would taste much better than this, and it definitely did not. I wish I had put some salt in it. At least it would have had flavor.	-1
Was between this & the plain jane 'multibran' variety during a Warehouse firesale, and am upset I went against previous experience (& thus my instinct) & went for these. The addition of raisins means you get less bran, since they're packaged by weight, and that you also can look forward to some tooth strengthening.	-1
Not a bad cereal or a bad option, but it's a misnomer/hyperbolic name for a cereal...there aren't many pumpkin seeds or raisins, and the crunch comes from the relatively bland bran. Canceled my S&S immediately; wish I'd tried one box before I sprang for 6.	-1
Taste like poo.	-1
These pieces of dried fruit look like they might have started out as apricots, but they are mostly brownish-black with a few spots of brownish-orange.  They look like the fruit was allowed to over ripen before being dried, and they taste that way too: so over ripened as to be almost nothing but a little fiber with fructose and no flavor of apricots whatsoever.  If you're looking for a soft, very sweet dried fruit with little real flavor of its own to add sweetness to a dish, these will be just the thing.  If you're looking for dried apricots that actually taste like apricots, give these a very wide berth.  A few astronomical units should do.	-1
Tasty	-1
They are too dry and look unappetizing.	-1
Nope; ate 2, then one more.  Sent them back. Did not have good flavor. Not sure why? I read the reviews and I thought I would give them a try. Nope, nope, nope.	-1
I have no complaints with the seller on "made in nature organic dried apricots  " . the problem is the rubbery tasteless brown piece of yuck. I literally could not keep them down. I was looking for a good flavor but after the first one , I didn't want to throw bag away. I had to though.	-1
These dried figs are labeled "organic." However, they are very soft. Dried figs are hard. These must have been sulfured to keep them soft. The last time (last week) I have two (2) figs, I got diarrhea within an hour. This is a fictional item.	-1
The taste was okay but I could not get it to stay mixed well.	-1
I like the price point but hate how hard it is to mix this up. Separation is expected in such a product, but I end up having to drain the oil off into a mixing bowl and then prying out the sesame paste with a fork. I work it with a whisk for five minutes or so and then pour it back into the can. I have purchased other brands that reach just require a quick stir with a spoon right in the container.	-1
did not like	-1
I guess this takes an acquired taste. I made some Tahini salmon last night and really thought it would taste like sesame, which I love. I tasted no sesame, just almost a very light peanut butter taste. It has 18 g of fat per 2 Tbs  so for those sensitive to a lot of fat this is not for you. I don't eat that much fat in 2 days. Way tasteless as far as I'm concerned. I added lemon to it and seasonings and couldn't taste anything but the gritty tahini. I guess it's just me. I don't like it at all.	-1
it was disgusting.	-1
These were OK. Flavor and sweetness level was good. They are chocolate and have chocolate chips in some of them.  However I found them to be hard and kind of dense. Like the dough doesn't rise at all during baking. Teeny tiny chocolate flavored bricks. Hard to bite into. Doesn't easily soften in milk or your mouth. You really have to chew these. My 2 and 4 year old were excited about these at first but probably found them hard to eat because after a couple I found them spitting slimey crumbled up bunnies all over the floor. And they didn't want any more...ever. They would rather eat saltines than these.  I kept them a couple of weeks but the kids never wanted them so I threw them out. It's great they're organic but who cares when no one (not even me) wants to eat them.	-1
Horrible odor, taste and aftertaste.	-1
nothing special	-1
not good tasting, no chocolate flavor, hard as a rock (the size of a pebble too).	-1
The fruit snacks made by this company are good.  I also liked the cheese bunnies.  But, the grahams, 3 different types that I bought, all tasted weird and nobody in my house will eat them.  They are further a waste because I can't give chocolate to any of my pets so they had to go in the trash.  The taste reminded me of bad oil even though the product was not expired.  Maybe a bunch of batches were stored at too high temperature.  After trying 3 different types of grahams by this company, I can't say that I would want to taste one again.	-1
No flavor. Very bland	-1
Was hoping these would be good, but NOOOOO. These taste like the smell of a horse barn!!! Put them out on the back patio for the deer. They ate them. Probably because they taste like livestock feed.	-1
UGH! This cereal is what I imagine drywall to taste like. HORRIBLE	-1
somehow I recall a different product...this one has a under taste I don't like	-1
These were stale and bland.  They're also an awkward, too large size.  The flavor they have is nice but they need a little more.  I didn't care for the texture but I couldn't tell if it's the brand or Amazon sent me an old/stale product.  I wouldn't recommend these, especially since they have almost no vitamins and minerals.  They're really just a sugary snack without the vitamins.	-1
Barbara's Bakery Cereal, Peanut Butter Puffins, 11 Oz. (312g), by Barbara's Bakery. This cereal is designed for kids. The cereal's title may not sound appetizing, but it tastes reasonably good, although not great, and it may leave your stomach feeling a bit queasy. Maybe my box was a bit rancid, as after eating a bowl, it started me burping, even though the Best By date was still in the future at: 07 June 2015. This is a puffed cereal, and the internal plastic bag is difficult to open. I am definitely not a weakling, but I had to use a pair of scissors to cut open the bag. After opening the bag, I noticed the smell of peanut butter, and after trying a piece of it, I decided that it tasted like corn and peanut butter. This cereal stands up to milk quite well without becoming soggy. I gave this cereal one star due to a strange aftertaste, too much peanut butter, the hard to open bag, my unsettled and burping stomach, and the high amount of salt used in making it. (Too much salt can cause high blood pressure and water retention. Processed foods in general contain far too much sugar and salt.) One bowl was enough. I dumped the remainder of the box into the galvanized metal bird seed barrel that I keep on the side porch for over-filling the bird feeder (the doves need to feed on the ground). At this point, it was too late to return it to the supermarket for a refund.

Lacks flavor and substance I won't buy again.	-1
I got these at Whole Foods. The pieces I COULD EAT out of the bag were tasty and nice. Chewy and flavorful. But half the bag had these ugly, bruised-dark looking bits, like they cut them off an overripe nasty section of mango.  I a Caribbean-born and mango is my favorite fruit. I had higher hopes for these. Ah, well.  Oh, and yeah, if you diet/calorie count, be careful of portion. The calories add up FAST....	-1
sorry but family disliked.	-1
Not impressed with this cereal -- tasted like "fake chocolate," and the cereal was soggy well before I could finish a bowl with milk.  Not going to re-purchase.	-1
Overall I did not like this and would not buy it again. For me it was really three issues: taste, texture, and appearance.  First off the taste isn't bad. However it just tastes too mild. While that does mean the flavors blend well it also means that for something that uses a lot a bold ingredients it all tastes like less than the sum of its parts.  The texture and appearance are of that of refried black beans. I had to scoop this out of the can with a spoon. While I do enjoy thick soups this was just so thick it didn't seem like soup anymore. That and the lack of the attractive looking corn and bean pieces shown on the picture just overall led to an underwhelming product for me.	-1
no flavor	-1
I didn't like the taste of this. Just my opinion.	-1
Not worth the extra expense. Buy your local grocery brand.	-1
Taste is not good	-1
Once I poured the milk on my bowl of EnviroKidz Organic Chocolate Koala Crisp Cereal, the chocolate slowly started coming off of the cereal and into the milk. The cereal absorbs the milk and causes the cereal to swell and have the most unpleasant, mushy texture. Maybe kids like it, but, as an adult who occasionally enjoys eating kids cereals, this cereal is awful.  I'm actively cutting any GMO products out of my diet. Kellogg's Cocoa Krispies has been a long time favorite of mine but contains High Fructose Corn Syrup, most likely made from GMO corn. I thought this would be a great substitute. I'm hoping to find some cereal that equals what I'm used to eating in texture and taste to an acceptable degree. I am so sick of granola and hope I can find some cereals that I actually like.	-1
Too dry/hard	-1
After Envirokidz changed their packaging to this new design I lost sleep at night for several weeks.  You cannot even imagine how rustled my jimmies were.  I eventually emailed the company to see why they changed the box design.  About a week later I got a (very unsatisfying) response.  All they said was:  "Our gorilla had a makeover.  If you miss the original gorilla, you can always find him here: [...]  Since the beginning of 2012, Nature's Path had been in the process of redesigning all of our packaging and wanted to give the Envirokidz packaging a new look and feel as we move towards a full line of products that finally looks like the family they are. Your comments have been passed to our Brand Manager and our marketing team."  Believe me when I say that these jimmies do not taste the same as the old ones.  They are good but not as good.  I would recommend a different cereal like Oreo O's or Count Chocula.	-1
It tastes so plain.. it just has a tiny hint of peanut butter.. barely detectable.  It is NOT EVEN CLOSE to Captain Crunch's Peanut Butter Crunch in the amount of peanut butter used.  It tastes more like Kix, as someone else has noted.  that's a shame because I really wish we had an Organic alternative to captain crunch's peanut butter cereal  For what it is.. (a non-peanut butter cereal) that tastes like kix.. it is so so.  I like it a little  I hope they improve this cereal and increase the peanut butter soon.. they need to add 10x more	-1
meh	-1
Chewing nut thins is unpleasant. It's like the crackers are too dry, become really compacted after exposure to moisture, and then you feel like you're grinding mill. The flavor is okay.	-1
Everyone else in the world might love these, but they don't do a thing for me. For one thing, I cannot taste even a hint of almonds. They are thin, and crispy, but they are more like rice crackers. If you read the list of ingredients you will find almonds way, way down there.	-1
While captain crunch peanut butter cereal isn't organic and has preservatives, (yuck) they make the best-tasting  Panda Puffs peanut butter cereal has almost no peanut butter taste.  It may be healthier but when i buy peanut butter cereal i expect it to taste like it... but their cereal tastes more like Kix.. just bland puffed corn balls.  I wish Panda Puffs tasted just like captain crunches peanut butter crunch but it doesn't even come close.	-1
Not as good as expected. Leaves a slight bitter aftertaste.  Not up to standard for Newman branded products.	-1
They are bitter,mushy and overpriced. Would never buy them again.  I couldn't believe the reviews I read about the bitterness but then I tasted them  ,my husband agreed they were bitter and mushy. I'll stick with SunSweet.  I usually like Newmans Own products but not this one.	-1
These tasted really strange. I had to throw them away.	-1
These prunes have a sort of burnt taste, and are not sweet at all. Too expensive for what you get.  My husband likes dried fruit, but these just were not tasty.	-1
This chili is nasty! I opened it, Took 1 bite couldn't stand it, fed it to my dog she loved it. Makes good dog food.	-1
ucky	-1
omg ew. I love the other Amy's soups, and I don't know what I expected this to be exactly, but it is what I think is scrambled tofu. It has a very off putting flavor.	-1
I will never buy this again, has a weird taste or perhaps a spice that does not belong in chili	-1
sounded so good, but didn't really like it	-1
okay	-1
Superior lack of flavor	-1
The first thing I noticed when I opened this soup was a strong onion odor.  When I heated it and tasted it there was an overwhelming onion flavor.  The consistency is not creamy smooth split pea puree but a chunky lumpy soup full of onions.  This is definitely not my idea of how a split pea soup should smell or taste.  I am trying to contact Amazon to send back the unopened second can I purchased.	-1
not very tastey	-1
awful stuff	-1
Can't taste any salt .  Don't like so much	-1
I did not like the taste or texture of this soup.	-1
TOO MANY CANS ARE DENTED !!!!  THIS CAN BE DANGEROUS !!!!	-1
In general this was well packaged etc. but I never expected that it would just be slices of apple with core, seeds, stem and all.  The edges were ok but the core was very hard and almost sharp,  Good flavor but I won't reorder	-1
Go with Campbells. I guess organic means bad aftertaste.	-1
TO SMALL	-1
As another person said, this is full of cores, seeds and stems.  They are okay the 1st time you eat some. After that they are stale. I do not recommend these.	-1
These are not for me. They have a very pungent apple flavor to them. If the flavor wasn't so pungent they would be fine but the flavor is a little bit of an overkill.	-1
I realize these are supposed to be a more healthy alternative to our favorite Goldfish, but no thank you.  They seem dry to the point that I had trouble swallowing them without something to drink, they definitely lack flavor and they are just plain bland.  Very disappointing compared to other Annie's products.	-1
I thought these would taste kind of like goldfish. They don't. They are extremely bland with almost no flavor st all.	-1
For me, these were somewhat dry and not really very tasty. I had lots of kids over and honestly, they would not eat them. I have had other Annie's products and liked them okay, but not these.	-1
Sorry, just didn't care much for them.	-1
One ounce is a small amount of anything but regret.  Be aware this bag is very small.	-1
kinda small ...	-1
yuck, no flavor, taste like salted cardboard	-1
not my favorite	-1
some of the chips were too hard to eat	-1
These were terrible and didn't finish eating the bag and just tossed them	-1
Chips are pretty good but this bag is not worth the price. there is nothing but crumbs in the bag. Its like a snack for a  toddler size.	-1
It's great texture, but the rest sort of falls flat.	-1
not worth 99 cents	-1
Tasted like crunchy tissue paper. Glad this was only one snack sized bag.	-1
mini mini	-1
Didn't like the flavor and I spent a lot of money on the 1 ounce. I guess I didn't read the description clear enough, but like others said, I feel a little duped.	-1
Dry and nearly tasteless with a cardboard-like texture.	-1
Tasted very bland. I did not like them.	-1
Small, small, tiny serving.	-1
My first 1 star review; These things are not good tasting it all. I didn't expect them to be as good as normal potato chips but at least tolerable enough to justify they are healthier.  Conclusion: I'd rather be fat and diabetic than suffer through eating these again.  I am actually glad the bag was small. The bag itself is about the size of those mini-chip bags you get for like 50 cents or so, you know the better tasting ones. Not only is the bag super small but it was only filled up about 20%, so overall I got maybe 10 chips in the whole bag for a little under $2.00. Complete rip-off.	-1
No taste and hard raisins	-1
Smallest bag ever for almost $2.	-1
It is difficult to know by the picture of the bag and the picture is the same on the larger bags.  Pay close attention to the oz size for all these pantry purchases.  Love the chips though.	-1
Not fresh.	-1
Terrible cereal.	-1
Can organic stuff taste good?  Not this one.	-1
They changed the formual on a product that was perfect. Have been drinking these for over a decade and this past shipment had an obvious different flavor. Searched all over to buy the orginial formula's to stock up on. Now I am stuck with over 50 or more of the new formula...will bring them to a food bank.	-1
I'll finish the box but it's really boring.  It's like eating a crunched up granola bar.	-1
The bag arrived with a giant tear in it, so baking soda had spilled out into the box. It was a nightmare to clean up and try to patch the hole so that I could make use of what was left. Not happy.	-1
Baking soda is baking soda. I use this for bath bombs and other cleaning stuff. Although, I went to Sams Club and found it for almost $6. Would not recommend someone to purchase this on here. Way to much.	-1
I use this baking soda regularly. It was the pricing that I found dislikable. I found the same product sold at SAM'S Club for a third of the price. I'll go to SAM'S next time.	-1
I bought this after reading the beaming reviews. I just don't like it. It doesn't taste like BBQ sauce to me. It tastes like very sour tomatoes. It's very odd and I don't like it.	-1
This was so bad I had to throw it out. Smelled like manure, and tasted like it too - I presume - never having drunk manure water.	-1
We used this ketchup in the restaurant I worked in. However, if you check out the ingredients, there is HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP in this ketchup. HFCS is NOT healthy for you. Heinz makes an organic ketchup WITHOUT high fructose corn syrup. Am switching to that ketchup. Amazon carries the organic non-HFCS Heinz ketchup if you are interested.  If you google HFCS, you will read about the health issues behind eating HFCS. Am surprised Heinz uses it in their popular ketchups.  Ingredients: Tomato Concentrate From Red Ripe Tomatoes, Distilled Vinegar, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Corn Syrup, Salt, Spice, Onion Powder, Natural Flavoring  Check out Heinz Organic Ketchup if you want to avoid the High Fructose Corn Syrup. It has only 4g of sugar per serving which is low. It is recommended that you don't go over 50g of added sugar a day by the World Health Organization, so 4g is acceptable.	-1
Arrived in Pantry Box with two of the packages crushed with apple sauce all over the inside.	-1
Gross tasting, I think it was rotten	-1
Delicious!  I gave them one star fir the non gmo baloney.  At some point people are going to outgrow their unfounded fears of gmos and these fear mongering companies will have mud on their faces for pandering to the fearful and sowing fear in the uninformed.	-1
This "Ketchup" if you can call it that should be Illegal. Wait it is illegal in Canada,Mexico and europe. The High Fructose corn syrup causes Brain damage, increases risk of diabetes, higher blood preasure. Heinz makes a natural ketchup, buy it instead. Also fight for our Government to get bigger so that we might have the same high food standards as MEXICO. Also if product wasent bad enough, it contains GMO's. DO YOU REALLY WANT YOUR KIDS EATING THIS?	-1
This product came with the bottom row seal not broken but 1 cup is 1/3 fill and other 2 3/4 full top ones ok	-1
smashed	-1
kids prefer the version with sugar	-1
Wasn't sweet enough for our taste.	-1
Came as one big clump.	-1
Every single can I ordered of Cento tomatoes were dented, severely	-1
I hate to pay the price of Organic anything.  I have raised enough gardens and other crops to know that you have to kill insects to raise good quality crops.  I truly wish Amazon would carry good quality canned tomatoes and other vegetables that were not Organic.	-1
The taste of the tomatoes is as close to perfect as they can get. The cans however were extremely dented and rusty. What a shame that I can't rate them higher. If it were just for the taste, they'd get 5*. But I'm tired of the rusty dented cans. Won't buy canned products from amazon anymore. Too bad.	-1
I'm cleaning up an older relative's kitchen and trying to establish if it is safe to eat their products. They don't have dates on the products I am looking at. Cento doesn't answer the customer service phone, you speak to a machine. If you have a question like is this safe to eat you are out of luck.  You leave a message and might as might as well tie a note to a squirrel and let it loose in the woods. Cento customer service apparently doesn't care about your familys safety enough to get back to you.	-1
Very expensive.  Didn't realize the local gourmet store was half the price.	-1
These tomatoes are mushy with a dollop of sauce on the top.  They're sweet with a modicum of tomato flavor-not at all what I expected.  If I bought these at Kroger I'd take 'em back.  The price is right but I have bought store-brand tomatoes that are better than these.	-1
Too fibrous to ear it its entirety. Very disappointed.	-1
I bought this to fill in on an Amazon Pantry order.  It was a most bought item so I thought I would try it.  I like cooking with artichokes and the price was right.  I tasted one out of the can and some of the outer leaves were still spiky on the ends....so I had to check each  one and most of them had to have some of the petals taken off.  The remaining pieces were good but it sure was a lot of work for canned artichokes.  I think in the future, I will spend more and save prep work time.	-1
Artichoke hearts are a food I have enjoyed often, so I ordered these to have some delivered. The appearance was not something I have seen before, or the healthy colors as pictured on the can. I will not purchase these again because I didn't like the appearance or the texture. I threw away a lot of it because of dark grey around the edges of the pieces.	-1
Don't know how the artichokes were because the can was severely dented so I did not open it.	-1
Great product and was my primary source of daily drinking water. Then Prime Pantry started putting buying limits on the product and now doesn't seem to offer at all.	-1
I react to this product because the scent is overwhelming and is chemically based, not natural lemon. I'm sure its fine for cleansing and dishes, but if you do have any chemical sensitivity like I do, be careful of this.	-1
I hate that I have to pull out scissors to open each packet plus it didn't always dissolve. Will not purchase again.	-1
It taste better than other brand named canned pineapples. That is the 2 stars. If I wanted to eat the core I would have bought a whole pineapple. Approximately 18% of each bite is hard core. I will not cut off the core on each tiny bite.  So much for the recipe I purchased this for. At the price they want I feel ripped off. Find your pineapple elsewhere.	-1
Not worth the price. Dole is a better buy	-1
Doesn't -technically- contains SLS, but it has similarly drying and sudsing ingredients. I adore tea tree oil and its scent, but this doesn't smell like tea tree, it smells chemical-y and artificial-citrus-y. Like Lysol, which isn't how I'd prefer to smell. Also much harsher and stripping than typical "SLS-free" shampoos.	-1
Doesn't work for my fine thin greyish hair. Weighs hair down.	-1
Really dries out my hair and scalp. Had to switch to another brand	-1
not as expected.	-1
Love the smell. Hate that my scalp had a reaction and it gave me a rash.	-1
The cans were banged up, and as you may know... It is therefore, unsafe to consume it.	-1
is like a can of water with half a bouillon of chicken flavor and sparse of any actual chicken or anything really.  might be good starter to make your own soup with which is how i ended up using it.	-1
Very light on contents. Maybe 7..10% food, but this is mainly BROTH. I would not buy again. Unless you want broth, you'll be hungry after eating a whole can, which will be maybe 5 bites of solids. I was surprised by the brand name being so empty!	-1
My personal taste...yuck	-1
i was dissapointed thought this would be good and nope it was not	-1
no disrespect Wolfgang...Sorry the soup is very bland and over priced .  Campbell s soup still has the best taste for the pallet	-1
Not sure I got this.	-1
Glue stays on skin when band-aid is removed, and bandaid shreds while you're wearing it. Then when peeled off, it rips into pieces. Weird- I love all the other bandages but these are faulty.	-1
This band-aids stays on very well...too well.  They will stay in an area that flexes, which can often pop off other band-aids, but when it comes time to get them off you will have a painful struggle.  They pull and irritate the skin big time and leave glue behind.  They are tough strips, as in tough on your skin.  I couldn't imagine using these on skin that has hair on it, as it would pull all the hair out...ouch!  There needs to be a good balance between a band-aid's ability to stay on and your ability to get it off again without a lot of pain.  This one falls too far to the former side.  Or they need to put a note on the box that says you need to use some kind of alcohol to get the band-aid off again.	-1
a bit harsh on the mouth.	-1
it has bad ingridients	-1
tastes worse than bad breath	-1
Left my hair lifeless, barely any scent.	-1
Doesn't detangle or silken my hair.  Won't buy again.	-1
Leaves my hair feeling crusty/dry like there's residual product after rinsing. I've found that vinegar leaves my hair way softer than any fancy botanicals..	-1
Left my hair lifeless. Barely any scent.	-1
Twice now the soup has gone bad long before the expiration date.  I suspect the new lid/seal mechanism is not air tight enough.	-1
Tomato soup from a can (store brand) is better.	-1
Tasted watered down. Other brand at warehouse club was much better and good price.	-1
Disappointed in this lavender and chamomile soap. Good detect only a faint scent of lavender. Fine lather, etc. as any Softsoap but definitely not lavender!	-1
Among the scent and cleaning power I like it.  Why the price went up $1.20 this month I don't like...	-1
Bought two and both pumps do not work. Has happened before too. Something wrong with their design as I have bought off brands and never have a problem.	-1
The flavor is no that of normal sugar. It's not good for cooking or in my coffee.	-1
BIG granules, and to flavored not to alter the flavor of whatever you use it for, especially coffee or tea. Baking is probably fine.	-1
ok	-1
Too watered down. Taste not bad but too runny.	-1
There is such a small amount of tuna in these pouches...ridiculous. Not enough to make one man-size sandwich.  I won't be purchasing again.	-1
So I bought this thinking it was normal tuna.  Nope.  White tuna is not normal tuna.  Its creepy and I don't like it.	-1
I did not like this soup.  It was almost all broth with very little substance.  The taste was just average.	-1
Waste of Money..this is disgusting...I just opened the first can and it is LITERALLY nothing more than "boiled water" with about a tablespoon of freaking rice,,,a couple of slices of carrot...and totally TASTELESS !! I mean, is he kidding.  Really, I had to add salt, pepper,  spices  drink the d$%@@ thing because it is nothing but colored water.....without exaggeration folks!  I want my money back...god !!	-1
You pay fora name.  Lower sodium is the best thing I can say about it.  The contents are sparse and this can of soup is one bowl only, not condensed.  Disappointed for the money...	-1
Very bland tasting. I won't buy again.	-1
Mostly broth. Very little edible content. Left me hungry and feeling taken advantage of. I bought a name and got mostly a can of broth.	-1
My personal taste...yuck	-1
Flavorless	-1
low in flavo	-1
So when this soup first hit the market about a decade ago it blew my mind. It had nice big bits of chicken in it, and was loaded with vegetables and rice. The flavor was mind blowing full of herbs tasted better than fresh homemade soup, in fact for years I have tried with my homemade soups to get the same amazing sage flavor that was in this canned soup and have failed.  I loved this soup and then it was gone, couldn't find it anywhere anymore.  I was so happy when I found this on Amazon. It came I opened the box heated up a can right away and was so disappointed.  There are hardly any pieces of chicken in it now, seriously there were like two pieces of chicken in the first can I opened. Hardly any veg, except for tons of nice cheap carrots, how do I know carrots are cheap, because that's what this is a can of carrots. There is not even much rice in it. Worst of all the flavor is gone, no more amazing herby greatness, just kind of a watered down version of it's former self.  It went from being an amazing product to being substandard, It's not even on the same level as Campbell's or Progresso anymore.  Sad.	-1
Where's the CHICKEN!!!  I am so glad I decided to try this for myself before adding to a gift basket for friends. It's very tacky and poor quality for organic food with a well known chef's endorsement. UGH!  and my final thought...it would be poor quality with a generic label.	-1
Yuck.	-1
We've been using this detergent for a few years now and couldn't figure out why some of our laundered clothes smelled so bad when worn.  I did a test by smelling them straight from the washer vs fresh out of the dryer using a dryer sheet. The clothes from the dryer smelled great but the wet clothes smelled bad. Not disgustingly bad just slightly unpleasant. After air drying some of the laundry and putting it in a drawer for a week they smelled much worse.  For a long time I thought the smell came from one of my dresser drawers (the one I put delicates in that I air dry) and began buying some products that you put in your drawers to take away musty smells. They didn't help much.  Needless to say I won't be buying this product any longer.	-1
I do read reviews. Usually, if a product has a positive rating with a great amount of persons, I feel safe in trying it. I know, my opinion might be different, but I feel that I can't be THAT disappointed. I usually do not use negative reviews for fear of sounding like some that do so, but it is cleatr that they are condeming a product for something that it did not claim or was supposed to DO! If I see an abundance of negative feedback, I will mostly always pay heed, and DON'T even GO there. I know this scored high, but off all of the cheap 2.00 detergents I have ever used.....this is HORRIBLE and it WASN'T inexpensive. I tried it because of the name, and I am trying to be more Earth conserving recycling conscious in EVERY product that I use. I was surprised at how much is "lathered/soaped" when using a little to wash in sink...and it LASTED. However, after letting something soak, that was not really visably too dirty, it looked a bit WORSE. I thought, ok maybe it is my imagination so I repeated the same thing 3 more times....now seemed to show soiled areas MORE! After I hung to dry....it did not smell "fresh" even though it did when I hung to dry! This has NEVER happened before. I will admit  I DO like things to at LEAST SMELL clean, even though I am sure some detergents are misleading in this way. Well, this one was....after drying NO SMELL and item appeared to maybe be more soiled after soaking in sink for HOURS.	-1
Really love this detergent! But the size of the container at the price I paid was not right. For that price I should have gotten a full size, instead we got a tiny bottle.	-1
It was good detergent, but I won't buy it again.	-1
I need to clarify what I hate.  I do not hate the product -- I hate the damages of the product.  This is the second time I have ordered liquid cleaning products and each time the bottles have been dented and the products have run out all over the other food products in the box.  When taking the detergent out of the shipping box, I got detergent all over my shoes and floor.  The shipping boxes are very sturdy and there are no punctures or damages in the exterior of the boxes so I was very surprised to see the damages of the merchandise.	-1
This detergent does a fine job cleaning clothes, but, I'm SUPER smell sensitive, and I thought it would be more natural smelling... it's NOT! I gave it to my mom, who doesn't have smell sensitivities, and even she said it smells like "old lady perfume" in her garage after doing a load of laundry.  It works well, is good for the environment, and if you like super perfumy smelling clothes, you'll LOVE this detergent!	-1
This product did not work for me at all, i tried cleaning different products and surfaces but it did not clean well.	-1
Came frozen	-1
I love Fiji. It's normally great water and I'll continue to buy it from retailers, but not online. My Fiji water shipment contained water that seemed old like it sat around in a warehouse for a while. I'd return it but it's just too much of a hassle (and my wife angrily dumped all the bad water and recycled the bottles). Maybe people don't order this too often and we got an old batch, but I won't buy it through Amazon again, not at least this size.	-1
Come on, people!  This is a complete rip off!  Paying at over $36 for only 12 bottles at 50.7 ounces apiece is paying over $3 for not even a HALF gallon!!  If you buy at this price you are paying over $6 for a single gallon of FUJI water!!  Outrageous!!  DON'T BE A FOOLISH SUCKER!!  DO NOT BUY AT THIS CRIMINAL PRICE!  There are much better deals for water that tastes just as good.	-1
Milk in order exploding ruining this, unable to determine quality.	-1
Family did not like it.	-1
If you like the old el paso enchilada sauce do NOT buy this. This is the most file disgusting crap I have ever had the displeasure of using in the kitchen it was watery, nasty tasting, nothing I did made it taste ok at all it was absolutely the most disgusting thing I have ever used. It sucks.	-1
I bought about 30 boxes of this pasta.  Before I got through a third of them I began to find boxes infested with insects that  looked to me like flour beetles.  Of course, this infestation could have started in my pantry, but I have been buying and storing pasta for reasonable  periods of time and never had this problem before.  If the boxes were sealed well,  this should not happen locally as I never use partial packages.  I do not mind eating sphagetti with beetles, but my wife refuses  to do this, so it  looks like my chickens will enjoy the pasta with this beetle  sauce.	-1
gets messy on the top, won't order again	-1
I bought this for my husband because he wanted to try a new toothpaste. We were both very surprised to find that it is spearmint flavored, which I hate. It isn't mentioned anywhere on the bottle or in the description. I think that I, along with most people, associate green with spearmint, so I assumed that the blue packaging meant that this was the minty flavor of most toothpastes. That was an incorrect assumption. It's also thin and runny and kind of soaks into your toothbrush, instead of sitting on top of it. The consistency grossed my husband out and I don't think he'll be using it again. The one thing we did like was that the shape of the container makes it easier to store than traditional tubes of toothpaste.	-1
defective and packaging was horrible	-1
Only ordered can - not a sack	-1
I do not like these sponges at all!  I thought I would give them a try bc my regular sponges were not offerered in Amazon prime. The "scrubber" part is awful!  It barely works from the start, and completely falls apart after minimal usage. Then you are left picking up little green pieces all over your dishes. These are also not as think as other sponges. I will never buy again. Horrible!	-1
Scrubby surface began to peel off the sponge within about 2 weeks. Won't re-order.	-1
I have used many brands of sponges in the past and I am sure I have used this brand before. But this time the sponges I received came apart a lot faster than normal. The green part separated from the sponge early on in its life.	-1
Band-aid bix all ripped and instead of 80 only 71 arrived!!!	-1
Are the walnuts? Are they diamonds? No, they are cashews	-1
Usable but broken up.	-1
Mini wheats are usually quite good. This flavor was on sale and bought a bunch. I regret it. If you want something that barely has any flavor go and get this. Its like Pepto Bismol over grains. I thought it was just me until I saw someone else pour a bowl and try to eat it then immediately get up to dump the bowl. After the recall right after getting this we threw it all out. [...]	-1
These band-aids are garbage. These shred when trying to take them off the skin, making them hard to remove.	-1
Beware, the chemical poison BHT included in small dosages as a way of preserving this item.  enough bht buildup can damage your body and or worse.  Most countries make it illegal for companies to sell foods containing bht.  the USA is one of the few that put the businesses before it's citizens and allow for such misconduct.  hopefully you will read this and think seriously about yours families health and start paying attention to what is foods	-1
Is there anything inside of these? I feel like I got a placebo pack. No results at all. I've used this brand before and liked it. But somehow, nothing.	-1
So thin and sticks to fingers trying to put on	-1
These bandaids do stay on the skin for a long time, but the material is so thin that when I try to pull the tabs off to apply it to the skin, the bandaid rips. I'm not sure if the adhesive was attached to the plastic covers too long and it made it harder to get off, but I have ripped several bandaids.	-1
These are a bit flexible but not fabric. plastic band aid and will leave your skin sticky.	-1
What happened?! Is this the Band-Aid brand rejects? So far half of these that we used either stretched apart while opening, or had little to no stick to them. Come on Band-aid, you can do better! Go for the cloth type or waterproof ones if you are going to buy band-aid brand.	-1
Tasted like hard cardboard. Not good at all.	-1
not very tasty	-1
Lacks flavor. Does not meet the standards of the usual Quaker breakfast products.	-1
