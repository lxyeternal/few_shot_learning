It's good for beginners	1
I recommend this starter Ukulele kit.  I has everything you need to learn the Ukulele.	1
G'daughter received this for Christmas present last year and plays if often.	1
According to my order history, I bought this this kit towards the end of 2012 as a Black Friday Week Lightning Deal. I'm writing this nearly four years later.  As with any stringed instrument, the strings really needed to stretch out before they would stay in tune. So, for the first several days, it was play a few minutes, tune, play a few minutes, tune. Then it was tuning daily. After a few weeks of this, the uke held a tune great. A tuner is not included in the package, which is the bulk of the minus star because a real beginner wouldn't have a way to tune the thing. (You need either a tuner or a reference note, say, on a piano or keyboard.) You can download a decent tuner app, though, for a buck or so. Do it, because you're going to need it a lot for the first couple of weeks.  The "Firebrand" ukulele is a laminated instrument of unknown wood. It's kind of dead-sounding. But then, soprano ukes generally sound a bit flattish to me - it's part of their distinctive character. The finish, while smooth, is spotty, and the decal around the sound hole has bubbles. But the fretboard is just barely adequately finished, with frets that are nicely flush with the edge of the neck so the feel is smooth - and has stayed smooth despite temperature changes. The beveled fret edges are filed, but not especially polished; even so, there's nothing to snag or catch. Fret dots are inset (one quite deeply) into the fingerboard and also painted on the upper edge of the neck, a nice touch. The action on mine is okay, at least down near the headstock where the starter chords live. The tuners are a triumph of cost-engineering: stamped metal with solid gears, so they're a definite step up from simple peg tuners. They make fine adjustments quite smoothly, and hold well over time. The bridge is slotted, so when you re-string you don't have to mess with that weird knot, just knot the end.  I visited a specialty ukulele shop yesterday thinking of upgrading, and played with budget beginner soprano ukes costing three times what I paid for this whole set, and to me they played about the same and most even sounded the same; a few were a bit louder. They were all, however, finished to a much higher standard. I left empty-handed, but will probably get a better uke sometime soon. They're fun!  The bag is lightly made, unpadded, and has a fixed-length strap for carrying. It offered no advantage over just grabbing the uke to carry it, while adding the considerable disadvantage of needing to unpack it to play. It promptly went into the giveaway pile.  We haven't watched the DVDs, because the book has been great. It starts with C7 and F, and then adds C and G7, then G and D7. So it's not the C Am F G combo very common on YouTube. The songs are American folk traditionals, so if you've been around a campfire where any singing was involved, you've probably heard them before. There are lots of good instructions available online, including videos, so, really, the book is just a kick-starter to get you going. It's a pretty good book, with a reference section at the back with more chord diagrams than you're likely to need.  In all, it's an acceptable inexpensive starter set, not worth the "list price" but an OK value at Amazon's discounted price and a bargain at the Gold Box/Lightning Deal price.  UPDATE: I changed the strings to the Aquila Nylgut AQ-4 set. Yeah, they're $10 strings on a $15 instrument, but the improvement in sound is just huge. I also polished the frets and fingerboard with a "magic eraser"-like product (an ultra-fine abrasive), shined up the body, and filed down the plastic saddle (which simply pops out of the bridge) to lower the action. It plays and sounds much better now, although the intonation remains sharp on several notes if you go note-for-note up the frets.  UPDATE #2: OK, after going through the book I binge-watched the DVD. It consists of two segments of about 33 minutes each, each segment subdivided into easy-to-locate chapters that follow the pages of the book. It's really very good! The "instructor" (and remember, I bought this four years ago so this may have changed) was musician Julia Jordan. Production values were good, and the multi-angle views of playing were helpful, as were all the play-along segments. Minor quibbles: Jordan played a larger ukulele than the one in the pack, so you can't hold it in the exact same way. And it seemed like the songs were keyed to a higher register than her natural speaking/singing voice (you can hear her singing her own songs on a special feature and she's very pleasant to listen to).  UPDATE #3: I now own a couple better ukuleles, have been a member of a ukulele meetup, and play a little almost every day. I can tell the difference between any of my better ukes and this one by both feel and ear. Still, it's a totally useable instrument, and it got me started on an enjoyable little musical hobby. Just remember to download a tuner app and maybe a metronome app and you're good to go.	1
Please pay attention better than I did to the reviews! This a very poor quality product. Will not stay in tune! If by chance you do order buy some better strings. The lesson booK is ok but that's about it. Do you self a favor and spend a little more. You will be glad you did!	-1
I purchased this as a gift for a friend who really wanted to learn. Its a neat little set and he adores it. However I am giving it four stars because the box was smashed in really good when I received the package. The big brown package box was just fine meaning that the product box the instrument came in was damaged before it was shipped. Luckily everything inside was just fine and not broken but the company should take better care when it comes to shipping damaged items.	1
thanx, b	1
Good cheap ukulele; got what I ordered.	1
My grandson is very happy with his new uke!	1
Great concept with great instructions and CDs.  The ukulele looks nice but the chords are frustratingly out of tune even with the strings tuned.	-1
good starter set up	1
I am enjoying my ukulele. I had one a long time ago. It came with a good teaching book with a CD and a DVD. The ukulele came with bag, and it also came with a set of strings.  I did purchase a tuner from Amazon, which works swell. I am learning to play already. It is fun to play. It is a good way to learn to play.	1
Good	1
Haven't open this yet. Cannot wait to see my son's face on Christmas Day when he opens it!	1
My 14 yr. old daughter already had a ukelele that I bought on Amazon a few years ago for about the same price ($34.95), but without all the accessories that this one comes with! She's planning to give this one to her best friend for her birthday soon. Learning to play a uke is pretty easy, and it makes it easier to learn to play the guitar later on!	1
Had to return this item. After it had been tuned and sat overnight, the neck tore away from the body of the instrument. The instruction book is very good for beginners.	-1
I'm leaving my original review below: However, I adjusted the rating to reflect the fact that I had to return this item because the neck snapped off from the body while in the padded case I had purchased for it. Due to this issue, I really think you would be in better shape buying the Hola! uke here on Amazon for a few more bucks and a separate tuner and instruction book. Youtube tutorials are invaluable, and plentiful. I hate to decrease my star rating, but it's obviously a low quality instrument and the Hola! uke is light years better sounding and looking.&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Hola-HM-121MG-Deluxe-Soprano-Ukulele-Mahogany-Binding-and-Aquila-Strings/dp/B00ATABRJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Hola! HM-121MG+ Deluxe Soprano Ukulele, Mahogany + Binding and Aquila Strings</a>Don't let this review stop you from picking up ukulele! This kit got me going, so it was worth the money, even if Amazon hadn't refunded me!  I'm a woodwind girl, but wanted something to take camping for around the campfire. Ordered this because it was a kit and on price point alone.  For the price paid, this has given me a lifelong hobby and a way to connect with my kids. Huge value.  The bag is pretty useless. It's thin and crinkly with no protective qualities, really. I suppose it would protect from sunlight and dust.  The cd and DVD are good, but I have gotten much more use out of youtube tutorials!  However, having the chords there in the book are nice, and does provide some basic musical notation info.  The instrument is obviously a "starter" uke. It's light and the finish isn't beautiful, but it doesn't look like a toy, either. The matte finish does attract fingerprints and is very plain. I bought some rub on transfers to personalize and decorate, which made me happier.  The strings do have to be tuned frequently, but I expected that from the reviews. After three weeks of daily playing they tune easier and stay tuned longer but still need tuning before each session. I bought  the Hola! Electronic tuner and just leave it clipped on. Works beautifully.  I think the sound is pretty and it seems reasonably well made for the price. I'm sure I will trade up in a year or two, but this is a great starter.  I would recommend this for anyone wanting to give ukulele a whirl. It's a fast learning curve, and super fun!	-1
Great inexpensive starter kit to see if you'll get into ukelele playing. This little cheap uke isn't a bad starter ukelele at all. In fact, it surprised me with its distinct "plunky" sound. Although I have other, much more expensive ukes, I still actually like playing this one!	1
This is such a cute little instrument, my daughter loves it and the sound is good.  The only downside is that it doesn't stay tuned for very long.  We always have to go and re-tune it, which can be frustrating.  But otherwise it seems well made, it looks great and when its tunes, the sound is good.  Its not multi-hundred dollar instrument, but for kids and beginners its a good deal.	1
My hubby and I decided we wanted to learn to play the uke, so we ordered this set based on decent reviews.  Wonderful.  We learned to play thanks to this kit.  While the instrument itself certainly isn't of high quality, it is more than adequate and has a good sound.  The real jewel in the crown 'tho is the instruction book.  Fab! It is highly informative, easy to follow, and has some good songs in it.  I still use it for reference and do not pick up my uke without that book nearby.	1
This is a great package for beginners. I never played a ukelele before but I learned to play guitar many years ago.  I have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so I downloaded an app called "Easy Ukelele" available in Amazon and Google Playstore for free.  That is the only ukelele tuner I can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your Ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune. I purchase this as gift to my son's 5th birthday that is coming up in 2 weeks so I have not yet preview the DVD and CD that came with it. I did however, checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school, sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs out.  My Review:  1. The Package: The box comes with the Ukelele, Beginners Manual, DVD, CD, carry pack, and 2 extra set of Ukelele strings. Tuner is not included so I advise that you either buy a tuner or download the "Easy Ukelele" app I mentioned above.  2. The Ukelele:  The Ukelele looks and feels decent. It has a sticker that says made in china. It comes pre-strung but it is out of tune.  I tuned it using the app I downloaded but it would not hold a tune. It is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings.  Basically, the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments.  Since the string is nylon, I gave it a chance to settle. I would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least 10 minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side.  I actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so I can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension. The tuner pegs stays in place so I know that the problem is with the string.  It could be that the string included is a cheap one.  After doing this a few time on day 1, I was able to play my first song I grabbed from the book (Clementine).  But after 1 song, you have to tune it again.  I just repeat what I did for the next 2 days, tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs. Yesterday morning I tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when I came back in the afternoon, I checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key I left them in the morning. I played with it for at least 10 minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and I was able to play at least 4 songs without any problem.  This morning, I checked the note again and they stay close to the G-C-E-A range. I could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more. Even if I have to tune it every day  I would not have any problem with it.  So, for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned, just give the string a try to settle. This are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in. Or you can buy a better quality string that costs around $9.00 for a set.  Another place you can check is the tuner, make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension. If it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little.  That is an easy fix.  2. The String: As I mentioned above, it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles. Even if you buy a  good quality strings, I am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning. It comes with 2 extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed. The problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it.  From some research I found online they said that the Thinnest string will be the A string. The second thinnest is the E string, The thickest is the C string and the second thickest is the G string. The extra string package says "Gangia Brand" on it so I assumed that that is the brand of the string.  3. The Book: I just scanned the book and I could tell that it is written well for beginners. The songs included progress from only needing 2 chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons. Each song have a chart on which chord you will use.  4. The Case:  The case will protect your ukelele from dust, water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop.  5. The DVD's and CD's: I have not tried the DVD and CD's yet but the DVD's I believe will have the lesson and the CD will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book. I will come back and edit this item once I get the chance to watch the DVD and listen to the CD.  Overall. This is a great price for the package.	1
Bought this as a starter kit for my daughter who wanted to learn how to play.  For the money, it is a great way to start and comes complete with all components well constructed.	1
Please don't listen to these amateurs talking about how the strings wouldn't keep tune. They don't know anything about stringed instruments or nylon strings. You have to keep tuning it until the strings stretch. Like all instruments, the strings have to stretch, especially with nylons, so be patient. It only took me about half an hour. It clearly states STARTER pack, so obviously its not going to be a high quality ukulele, especially because of the price. These people just do not know how to read. It has a great sound, but the 'lightweight gig bag' definitely is lightweight. If you want real protection, I would recommend getting a hard case or something along the lines. it is a great buy though, considering the price. I highly recommend this product.	1
I have never played a string instrument... and it looks like I'll be able to get the hang of this very quickly. Only problem is the strings. Sting one ... play's "dead" meaning it will not stay in-tune. Not sure if the knot is slipping or it is the string type that is the problem. Have another set of strings [better quality] and will try that set soon.	1
This is a good starter for children to learn, and easy to follow with the song book and whole family love it.	1
If your looking for a starter Uke and you want to learn, this is a good cheap way to start. Once the uke got tuned which takes about 2-3 days with the string stretch, it plays well and sounds good. It's fit and finish isn't the best, and the sound is marginal, but overall it's a real decent value. Later when I have achieved more experience and talent, I can upgrade. I have paid so little for this setup, that it is easy for me to pass it along to someone else that wants to learn the Uke and there is no real financial loss. Hint-Get the Snark SN-6 Ukulele Tuner. It is small and accurate, and makes Tuning a breeze.. which you will be doing a lot of the first few days. If it don't sound right to me, I just check it with the Snark. KEEP THIS FOR THE NEXT UPGRADE  You can put better sounding strings on this unit and it sounds better. But for learning the Uke.. it really can't be beat. I'd give it 5 stars if it were a better quality Uke... Plus it's a unit that can go on the road in a pack on a motorcycle, to the college dorm, and there is no worries your risking damage to an expensive unit. It's a perfect learning instrument. Then you can do with it what you want once your ready to upgrade... give it to a niece or nephew, grand child... send it off to college, you name it.. it will always be worth what you paid for it.... I have no negitives.. it is what it is... designed to be a starter Ukulele, and it preforms that task with class... I am not afraid to show or let pro's play it and look at it.. they are also impressed with its quality at the cost. I used lemon oil on it and hand rubbed it out to a dull luster, and put better strings on it.. so with that.. it is impressive for the cost. There are better Uke's on the market... those are for pro's. This is a starter unit.	1
I purchased this set, based on the reviews, as a gift for a young neice.  Rather than just giftwrapping the box, I took the uke out, tuned it, retuned it, stretched the strings, retuned it.  After 2 days, it would hold tune for about 3 minutes of playing (junk strings are probably to blame).  I did all this because my neice would be a beginner and therefore be easily frustrated by an instrument that would not hold tune.  Next I went to a "learn to play" site on the net and found C Am F G7 chord diagrams and started to attempt to play.  The strings were so high off the fretboard that any note fingered above the 3rd fret would pull the string out of tune.  The easy chords were difficult because the high strings got in the way of my fingers so that I could not finger a chord cleanly.  With the intonation and tuning problems, I was not willing to give this instrument to my neice, so next I went to a local music store to see if a set of strings and some shaving of the saddle (the white peice on the bridge that the strings rest on) would make it playable.  In order to gain a frame of reference, I picked up a $78 uke and strummed my newly learned chords.  It sounded and played great!  I told the music store guy that I wanted this uke to play like the $78 one.  He said the the cost would equal the original cost and still might not produce a good instrument.  Then he showed me a $40 instrument, an entry level uke from  Kala or Lanakai.  It played like the more expensive one, but didn't have the pretty binding, etc.  I loved it and bought it.  When I got home I called for an RMA and will send the much inferior Firebrand uke with all the books and cd's back to the seller.  The sellers were nice and seemed concerned about selling an unplayable instrument.  It's too close to Christmas to waste time on this one.  Hope this helps you out.	-1
Good value. Decent quality. At the deal-of-the-day price it was a downright steal. But as others have said, these nylon strings are tricky to tune and don't hold a tune worth a darn. Perhaps better quality strings would work better. But a nice little instrument for a beginner, or for taking camping! The book was unexpectedly high quality. (Haven't watched the video yet)	1
Very ordinary suctions, but strong. Can adjust the angle and height. Overall well adjustable. BUT: slides on the lap. The instruction booklet says put something under your foot to bring the leg up if it slides!!!! If I wanted to put something under my foot, why would I buy a guitar support???? Basically it has been impractical and unusable for me due to constant sliding.	-1
Honestly, it's painful to play hunched over at this point in my life.  The A-frame allows me to sit up comfortably like I'm wearing a strap , but without the added weight on my shoulder.  It's pretty easily adjustable.  I find myself using it on either leg (classical style or traditional) and it works either way pretty well, keeping me from bending.  In the past, I've had one of the cushion-style supports and they just aren't the same.  You can't adjust them well enough to really use them to suit your specific needs, depending on your height, guitar etc.  This is the one to get.	1
This has to be one of the best investments I've ever made, barring my case to protect my baby. It folds up and fits in my case just barely, but more importantly it does what it's supposed to do - help maintain proper form. I used a foot stool for awhile but I always ended up getting a little kink in my back that still hasn't gone away completely. The thing just works - I pop it on and my guitar just sits in my lap, ready to play. The black strap on the bottom is rubberized so it doesn't slide around on your leg. I've gotten a lot of people who ask me where they can get one. I can't believe Guitar Center doesn't carry anything like it.  Definitely recommend.  On a side note, after having it for a few months, some of the black coating on the metal flaked off, but to no detriment functionally.	1
Where have you been all my life? This should be standard for all classical players. (Get the cheaper one though.)	1
No more pain finally! I had a foot stool/stand and after an hour of so of playing/practicing, my leg and back would start hurting even when sitting properly. In addition I could never get the proper neck angle for the straight wrist I wanted. No more with this amazing support! Plus the support folds in when I put away my guitar on its stand. Thank you for making this! Pure and simple awesomeness!	1
So far it works as designed but it needs ridges to help develope your caluses.	1
seems simple,,,we will see	1
I'm thrilled with this system for learning guitar. I've always wanted to learn but felt learning chords was daunting. Now, I can learn the timing of strumming and pick strumming without worrying about the chords so much (yet). I'm moving ahead slowly with this system and have started playing the songs in the course and this success has created within me a desire to continue. We also have one for my left-handed son (7) and his left-handed guitar. He is learning right along side me. We are really enjoying doing this together. The Chord Buddy has made this easy and affordable. Once we complete the course the plan is to move on to more lessons so this isn't the end-all but it is the best way I've seen to get started. I'd recommend this to anyone that wants to start out. Tip: Be sure to get a "new" Chord Buddy that no one else has pulled out and replaced the tabs already.	1
this has helped me so much in learning how to play the chords with ease	1
It didn't fit in my accoustic guitar but it did works perfect on my electric guitar. I haven't use it anymore. I'm just learning the chords without the chord buddy, I know 3 already all you need to do is practice, practice, practice.	1
Can't believe this little gem. I ordered one for my wife sort of as a joke but after a week she was strumming songs on the guitar without the Chordbuddy. Last Sunday night, five weeks later, we had a picking at our church and she played along with us for two hours. Now a couple of things, l have played guitar professionally for years and I was able to show her some shortcuts and "tricks". She has learned to move between most chords quickly and without difficulty. I have her using a capo for songs in the key of C as she has some trouble holding F chord but she will master that. Also, the instruction materials that come with the system are great. She faithfully practiced for at least an hour every night sore fingers and all but after five weeks I can't believe what she has accomplished. I don't believe that just anyone could do what she's done in five weeks because she was driven to play. I have a small recording studio and she plays piano for our recording sessions which helps her as she understands cord progression and structure. But... If you have wanted to learn to strum a guitar using proper chords to play most any songs, don't hesitate to get the Chordbuddy. It is beyond doubt the best way to learn to play a guitar I've ever seen!	1
did not like..sent back for refund	-1
Waiting to hear the results	1
I wanted to love this product so badly and debated tirelessly over purchasing or not... DO NOT BUY THIS!  It is cheaply made, would only play correctly for about two key changes and slipped out of place, And never could get it to fit my 3/4 size guitar right like my research of the company's website said it would.  I immeadiately sent back and got a refund!  I was so disappointed!	-1
ok for learning,	1
I was curious as to how the Chord Buddy would work. Actually I was curious as to IF it would actually work, and this is what I've found thus far - Once you get the Chord Buddy installed on your guitar properly it works like a charm. I installed mine on a Squier Strat and found it was very easy to adjust properly. Within a minute or so I was playing chords easily and could work on my timing & strumming. Shortly thereafter I was playing LaBamba. I believe that it is important to make sure you install it absolutely in the proper position. I did find that it fits my Squier Strat better than the acoustic I also tried it on (although it does fit the acoustic, just not quite as well - a bit of string buzz, but still playable). I can't speak as to whether the Chord Buddy will actually help with finger dexterity (it very well could) or help actually learning to play the chords (it might) since I've had it less than a week, but it certainly helps me work on timing & strumming as I mentioned above. I do believe the Chord Buddy will be an excellent tool to get my daughter more interested in playing the guitar and that is definitely a good thing. I think it's a great idea and time will tell how well it helps with finger dexterity. But for now I give it 4 Stars as it is easy to use and actually quite fun.	1
do not waste your money it's not near what it's made out to be a waste of time money and any effort put into ordering it and im disapointed in amazon for allowing it to be sold on there web site there able to check reviews to see if a item is worthy of being sold on your web site	-1
I found this product very clumsy, I'm sorry but didn't help me!	-1
Did not fit on guitar as well as seen on tv. Still trying to figure it out. A little harder than it seems. Or it was just me.	1
I have two guitars, and Ovation Celebrity and a small travel guitar called a Montana made by Kaman.  The Chord Buddy did not fit either one!  I am a very mechanically inclined person, and tried for quite a while to make the Chord Buddy work.  Apparently, it fits "most" guitars--so be careful!  Maybe a quick call to the manufacturer will help.  They would be smart to track the guitars it does not work on.  I think it's a great idea, and I'm disappointed that it would not work for me.	-1
don't waste your time getting this. is made out of cheap stuff. does not teach you anything on how to play guitar saw it on shark tank thinking it would be good but was i fooled	-1
Don't bother, it doesn't fit well and is cumbersome to use. The one I got, one of the tabs (green) doesn't stay in the locked position and must constantly be adjusted. However if you want to learn to strum with rhythm you can learn 4 chords and several songs using those 4 chords. Throw the chord buddy in the trash and look for an Ez-chord same device, much better stable usable.	-1
my daughter was strumming along on Christmas morning.  this is definitely able to provide a false sense of actually playing the guitar, but with the lack of patience that younger generations appear to have this is a good item to have.	1
perfect	1
I am just learning to play the guitar, and this is a wonderful way to learn. You start by learning strumming techniques. You can then move one key at a time and learn to finger chords. Meanwhile this gets you playing right away.  Sometimes I have to adjust it just right so the chords play correctly. It will not play as well as when  you learn fingering but is is an easy way to learn to play..	1
There are no real shortcuts to learning to actually play guitar, but if you want to get someone started this is helpful.	1
I am just a beginner. Was playing chords within an hour. Very happy with it. Set-up took a little time. After that I was flying. Easy on the fingers. The DVD is very helpful. Makes it fun to learn. Should have bought two.	1
It did what it was suppose to. Hard to keep it tuned. I like it and would recommend it to anyone	1
I am a intermediate player. I know these chords. I am getting older and my hands getting slower. So I bought this to use to save a little on my tired hands. I can play many many songs with just these few simple chords and that is why I purchased it and I was hoping my child would see the ease and give it a try, I hope they do. this is a good learning tool for novice players that allow them to play songs in just a few moments, something very few systems do. Many get fustrated tring to play, this item takes away allot of that fustration in learning hand positions and allows them to play a song immediately. Great product for the novice, and the intermediate player and some older players with age may find this simple solution of tired hands easy to compensate for that problem and still play.( one thing I must mention, do not let this be a crutch for learning the correct chords and finger positions. It is so easy it will distract that fact from your learning and make it easy to push one button instead of learning the fingering and you will rely on it to much,Please learn from it and don't rely on it all the time) Still a great product and will indeed help you to learn the finger positions one chord at a time.	1
Hi, loved the chord buddy.  I just got a new guitar for Christmas.  I am also brand new to playing, and this is very helpful.  I'm sure it will be great for people with arthritis that already play and want to continue playing without the pain.  I like the beginner cheat method to help me learn.	1
I never used it yet. But my husband tried it out .He plays in a band with a guitar. And his comment was ,he was amaze on how it let you play. He said you have to learn where the color are with your finger. It was a bit awkward for him because he can play a guitar. But he said it would be great for me to teach me. Thank you	1
First off, if you're one of the people who've gotten this to work consistently, congrats and I'm glad you're happy.  There seems to be a lot of good reviews, so good for them.  And it is a great premise, the books/DVD are very well done.  Where it falls short for me is in the actual device.  The plastic 'fingers' tend to drift a bit (they are removable), and they hit each other and mess things up.  But the major flaw is how it attaches to the guitar.  It clamps to the neck on the sides, however, the Chord Buddy needs to stay above the strings (so as to not hit the wrong notes), so it also needs something to hold the top solidly.  But any pressure on the buttons causes it to 'fall' down a bit, making contact with the wrong strings.  I'm going to try to clamp it so this doesn't happen, but with the finger drift, I'm not sure this will work anyway.  One wonders what would have happened if they had used better materials?  Update:  figured I'd post this, maybe it will help others.  I had to file some edges of the fingers that were rubbing against each other.  Then, in order to stop them from 'drifting' back into each other, I had to glue them (fingers not removable anymore!).  No biggie for me, as I don't see doing half Chord Buddy, half fingering anyway.  The biggest fix came in keeping the Chord Buddy from tilting down.  I took a rubber band and looped it over the rounded plastic (by the tightening screw), underneath the neck and hooked to the other side.  This gives it enough tension so as to not continually flop down.  While it now works, I can't give a better grade.  For this much money, it should work well out of the box.  Second Update:  I also picked up a copy of Rocksmith.  I would have to say that Chord Buddy makes you feel like you are playing a song (strumming a few chords is all it is really doing).  Rocksmith lets you play single notes and then graduate to more, while also making you feel like you are playing along.  I would have to recommend Rocksmith over Chord Buddy, and it's cheaper to boot!	-1
I love the Chord Buddy!!! I have learned to play the guitar and have learned to strum so many ways!! I have shown it to my friends and one friend had me order one for her!!  I just can't say enough. If you love music, you will love this!!!  Karen Strader	1
This books proves to be handy to any self-learner. I have been playing guitar for 4 years now, yet this book and the 7002 come with great pieces of advice. The eagle cartoons and illustrations are funny and go straight to the point. I recommend this book to anyone looking to learn guitar or anyone who might want to renforce concepts. Besides, it has an affordable price :)	1
The Ernie Ball series (1 & 2) is great for learning guitar basics.  Now you just need to practice, practice, practice.	1
I have been using QSC K10s for close to a couple of years now. I am a solo performer, playing a variety of styles from acoustic singer-songwriter stuff to loop-driven electro-rock. I typically play bars and have probably used these for nearly 100 gigs at this point.  3 K10s along with an&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Allen-Heath-ZED-10FX-Four-Mono-Mic-Lines-with-2-Active-D-I-3-Stereo-Line-Inputs-and-Onboard-Effects/dp/B003T77ZJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Allen & Heath ZED-10FX Four Mono Mic/Lines with 2 Active D.I., 3 Stereo Line Inputs and Onboard Effects</a>&nbsp;mixer make up my whole system, using two as mains and one as a monitor. My previous system was a powered Mackie box and passive 12" speakers by Community and Yamaha.  I have thus far been thrilled with the significant sound improvement I have experienced. The volume and clarity that these 10" speakers produce is truly impressive. To give you an idea, I generally play rooms that are one to two thousand square feet in size and rarely turn my mains up much past 50%. At 60-75% levels (with mixer meters peaking around the zero mark) the music will cut through even the rowdiest bar noise.  One thing that's great about this 10" model is the throw. With a super-wide 90 degree dispersion angle, sound fills out the space up close within a few feet, depending on placement (I prefer getting them up as high as possible on stands and using the clever 7.5 degree tilt function). The dispersion angle is also matched between the woofer and tweeter so you're never hearing just one or the other. 90 degrees is ideal for tight performance areas where you want people right in front of you to hear everything.  The trade-off here is that levels decrease quickly as you step back from the speakers. You can hear a significant difference as you get more than twenty or thirty feet away. While that could be seen as a negative especially for public address applications, I find it to be a win-win.  It essentially creates a "full sound" zone around the stage for the audience. I personally prefer creating a live music environment where people can hear a loud, full spectrum mix if they like but not have it forced on them wherever they are in the room. If your needs call for a speaker with more reach, the K12s (I've used them) throw a lot further and sound awesome as well.  Speaking of sound quality, I will say that while I think the K10 kicks the competition's a** throughout the EQ, it is especially spectacular in the mids and highs. Just playing an iPod through them, you will hear separated parts of the music in this range that you never did before. As far as your perfomances go, vocals and guitars will sparkle in a way you probably haven't heard out of a small cabinet.  I don't want to downplay the bass response on these though. It is huge and far more than you would expect out of these little guys. The frequency coverage is absolutely there and can even be boosted if you utilize the DEEP switch. What you will NOT hear in the lower registers however is a ton of attack. They are more suited to adequately express a jazzy upright bass than they are to throw down the punch you want to hear from electronica or hip-hop (unless we're talking smaller spaces, they'll ROCK a house party DJs). Impressive but you'll find no magic here, that's why they make the Ksub.  Prospective buyers should also know that the 1 KW amp in these is Class D. That's not equivalent to 1000 watts in Class A for example. It's more than sufficient though and Class D amps are great for their light weight and power efficiency. I plug mine into a surge protector that powers a bunch of other devices simultaneously and have never had an issue.  Signal routing is wildly flexible with the fantastic panel on the back. You can do whatever you want with these including play a small gig with one speaker alone. Just plug a mic, an instrument, and an iPod directly in.  Ergonomics are well done too. Knobs and switches are not fancy but easy to operate. There's also super sturdy, comfy handles on the top and on one side. Carrying two at once is easy (32 lbs. each) and saves you a trip back to the car.  The build quality is solid. I've always been careful with them but not used cases or bags and the only damage thus far has been cosmetic. The sides will scuff up pretty easily so use the duffels if thats important to you.  I have not observed any malfunction up to this point other than some buzzing from the monitor once when it got rained on. After drying out, it didn't happen again. QSC has also put some serious limiting circuitry into these as well to protect themselves from blowing. I have more than once pushed my monitor too hard and reached this threshold. The signal simply cuts out when the the speaker cone experiences too much travel. Once you readjust the levels, you're back in business with no issue.  I can't think of much to gripe about, the whole K series was very well thought out. I would love to incorporate a Ksub at some point as the crossover function is built into the entire line. These speakers aren't cheap at $700 a piece but you'll be paying for quality and design that cannot be found elsewhere.	1
I like this speaker. I bought a pair of K10s because I wanted a stereo image for my piano and the clarity and presence are phenomenal. Un-muddied left hand bass and crisp high notes. I'm hearing subtleties in my keyboard that I haven't heard before. I'm using them on stands behind me in my Irish band to mic an accordion and tin whistle and they both sound great with these speakers running through an 8 channel Yamaha mixer.  At 32lbs, they're easy to carry around, especially with the totes, and light to get up on stands. These speakers go really loud, so it's nice that I can set the speaker fader only half way and still get good volume. Really helps prevent feedback from the condenser  mics.	1
Best bang for the buck.  Great bass for a 10" speaker - perfect for singer/guitar player plus I use it as my monitor for the rock and roll band.  Excellent quality.  Enough inputs to bypass a mixer but I still use a Yamaha to fine-tune the sound. I have two of these plus an EV ZLP powered 12" speaker as a monitor but if I had the money I'd have 3 of these instead.  Buy with confidence.	1
I bought these offered in a special bundle on Amazon. They are in a class by themselves - really a top product. I have pro speaker gear from JBL, Mackie and Cerwin Vega. They are all good, but for me, these QScs are simply the best for sound quality/clarity, loudness and integrated power (500W per driver = 1000W per cabinet). When you then further consider the portability, functionality and performance, they are fully worth their premium price tag. I was initially sceptical about the high price, having bought them after all my others, and for more money, but I now think they may well have been my best-value purchase of the lot. I certainly use them more than all the others for convenience including outside jobs with potentially suspect weather (I got the matching outdoor speaker covers and so they can play on their stands outdoors in light rain). I remember at an outdoor gig once, the wind blew my projector screen unto my K10 speaker and stand, so that the K10 fell about 7ft to the hard asphalt ground. It suffered a small dent on the front grill (was in the cover), but did not skip a beat and kept right on playing through the incident, and have continued on with no problems ever since  All in all, a really fine powered pro speaker. You can get many alternatives for much less, but I think this is really outstanding value for money	1
Although it seems pricey, I've got to say that this is the best sounding powered speaker I have ever heard or used. It is awesome for vocals - rich and full, excellent clarity. Awesome for acoustic guitar and violin - very natural sounding. Very good for recorded music. It's not particularly great for bass guitar, but it's OK. Great coverage, it opens up right away, short throw situations this works very well. This thing is LOUD but still very clear. If they weren't so expensive, I'd have bought another one already. I think I need a sub for the bass, though.	1
recib una referencia diferente a la comprada por lo cual no cumpli con la satisfaccin del cliente sin embrago me retornaron el excedente	-1
These speakers definitely have a decent sound.  I would pair them with the sub for the best sound.  I do have a couple of issues with my speakers though.  The shipping boxes are not the most protective.  There is no foam inside the box just a piece of cardboard on top and bottom.  Hence, both grills had dents in them from shipping.  Fortunately, I was able to tap them out but they are not perfect and should be when bought new.  The other issue is that one of the fans comes on very quickly and is considerably louder than the other fan.  The QSC tech said it was normal because the speakers were meant to be used in a loud environment and fan noise was given no consideration.  I don't buy it since the other speaker's fan is much quieter.  Still I think the speakers are a good buy.	1
These are definitely great and light weight to use as monitors for a 4+ piece live band, but did not satisfy my expectations while using it for mains. It is great as mains for a single to a trio act, but not beyond if you want that solid full sound of a 4+ live band. It's basically personal preference, therefore for my use, it's limited to being a good source for monitors. And the quality is superb but don't lay it on its grill when using the carrying bags because the grill dents easily.	1
I can only compare these with the Yamaha DXR (?) series. I own both, being a two keyboard household. I prefer this one, but both sound great. The QSC is extremely well built and goes into low power mode when it should.	1
Very easy to play and sounds great.	1
works and sounds great for what it is!	1
Pretty easy to use,-- But the tuning keys do not stay on key.  I bought it for my 92 year old mom and she did find it easier!  It is well made  but I believe the instrument is warped.  I returned it as it is frustrating to play it.	1
LUV IT, great sound, came still tuned nice accessories, easy to play with cards	1
Perfect for anybody!!!! Price is VERY reasonable. Great sound. Music sheets make it easy to play. I suggest getting the Music Maker carrying case as well to protect the harp and the music sheets. Tuning is tricky. I suggest too getting an electronic tuner!!! EZ-Tuner 8 works great. The harp music relaxes me, and whenever I am feeling stressed, I pause a while and play my harp. Have fun.	1
Naturally, the thing Arrives out of tune..After going through a Ridiculous Ordeal, I Finally managed to get it tuned.( I have been tuning Guitars for 55 Years and Never had to go through such a labor Before!)  Once, however, I managed to tune this harp,..it sounded very Sweet!  It's a lot of fun, too. Of course, I hope I won't have to touch up the tuning Too often...	1
My 8 year old daughter loves this. It is a great gift for both boys and girls.	1
Not for a professional gig, but it's playable.  But, realize you have to learn how to tool it, even if it were tune prior to shipping.  Any string e x instrument will quickly go out of tun e u until it is broken in.  One of the sheets describes which strings should be turned to which note.  You need any reasonable means to tune it, be it an electronic tuner, a keyboard, or reference tones off the internet.  This is one of those things you have to learn to do for any string instrument.  By the way, when tuning the peg will sometimes get to a position where it will seem that you can't properly get the tool on it.  The tool has the same opening on the other end, only rotated, so you sound use the opposite end of the tool if you when you run into this situation...probably buried in the instructions somewhere.  Happy harping... and look for their song book for addition music templates... No need to learn to read music, if you don't want to.	1
I do strongly believe that every household should have one of these harps. Even if you don't like Celtic music, these little harps are really cool!	1
This is a great product. It is easy and fun to play. I am a musician, so was able to tune it without difficulty, but it was completely out of tun when it arrived, which would be a problem for a some. This is, by the way, our second harp--I bought one about 10 years ago. Since my young daughter likes it, I bought a second one so we can play together.	1
after 1 year, still going strong. Recommend!	1
Really good set of cans...very good overall...all genres.  These things need power to perform at there best, amp hungry.  They are not my Ultrasone PRO 550 or PRO 750...but they make an awesome set for a family set headphone.	1
I bought this item nearly 10 years ago in a supermarket for 375 Eur (~$450) when it was brand new! They're awesome headphones, about 4 years down the road the rubber starts peeling off, revealing the fabric to cover the ears.  These headphones are quite loud, but 24ohms, so they're not as loud as a 4 ohms headphones, but make up for their sound quality.  They are very neutral phones, sounding quite even in the whole register. If you're mainly doing techno and house stuff, you might as well go with the much cheaper Sennheiser HD505, not for sale anymore. They have the Sennheiser 202 which are very close to the 505's. SOundwise they sound about just as good, little less mids, just as loud (if not louder), just as good lowend, crisper brights. I find the senheisers better sounding than these sony's, although these sony's sound more linear, less crisp, more evened out in sound.  these sony's are better for overall listening, like a variety of styles ranging from classic,to jazz, to pop etc... The Senheisers are better for techno, house, pop, dance, r&b, hiphop etc...  If I can compare these 2 headphones (as they're all I have to compare eachother with), I'd go for the senheisers, because they're less than a quarter the price of these sony's and overall just as good. If you're an audiophile, wanting to get the best, obviously these sony's are better, but not by much. In fact, most people might not even hear the difference even if they had to A/B them.	1
I have been beating these around for 9 years now and they are just as great as the day I bought them.  Still intact no sign of wear and tear.  Love the fold up design.  Glad to see they are still making these.	1
I will keep it simple folks! I bought them, I tried them, I love 'em! Very versatile so far! I'm no sound expert, but I know what I like! And these Sony's are great! I also plan to try the Beyerdynamics 770Ts with 250 ohms and compare sound quality and comfort! Shipping was fast and my phones were in mint condition upon arrival! Thanks again Amazon!	1
The other reviewers wrote some great info about this Microphone.  Some drawbacks are the relatively bulkyness of this unit as compared to others. The sound quality is sufficiently clear when recording, but is not sensitive enough to satisfy the most demanding users such as musicians or professional reporters.  As the other reviewers have said, you need a relatively loud source as there is no sensitivity switch or zoom feature.  It does have the 90-120 degree switch, so you can toggle the range depending on what you are recording. This microphone is very compatible with many different devices.  MD is the best though. Here's one MD player recorder that I know has the microphone jack and works great with this microphone: 'Sony MZ-NF810CK Net MD MiniDisc Recorder with Car Kit' However, don't be fooled.  Not every MD player has the appropriate Mic Jack.  Double Check the technical documentation to make sure.  Units that definitely do not have it are: 'Sony MZ-NE410 High Speed Net MD Walkman Recorder' Notice the deceptive "Recorder" moniker in the product name.  Don't be fooled!  Very few MD "recorders" actually record with a microphone! Not sure about these: 'Sony MZ-NF610 High Speed Net MD Walkman Recorder' 'Sony MZ-N510CK NetMD Walkman/Recorder with Car Kit' 'Sony MZ-N505 Net MD Walkman Player/Recorder' Do your research before purchasing any MD player.  All in all, this is a good value and pretty good quality for a digital microphone.	1
Okay, okay, I caught your attention. I bought this to plug into my Tascam DR-05 compact recorder-- the plan to record my rock and roll band. I LOVE IT. The recordings are unparalleled. Highly recommend this unit. It records the loudest shows, rock concerts, small club gigs, and I record every practice and we play, and it has been to  MANY shows! The Mic appears to be a well designed mic that will go forever (the battery life is great [1AA] too) Great, as well,  its picking up the most sensitive sounds. I also used it with my outdoor drum circle. Listening to the recording, you could close your eyes and you wouldn't know you weren't there in person --- of course the Tascam is pretty high quality, but this is GREAT. Buy it!!!  EDIT - November 16 2016 ---- and this thing is STILL making recordings of live rehearsals that are mind-blowing. I put them on Soundcloud and everyone remarks on how amazing they sound. Great mic, can't say enough about it.	1
Really nice mic. I've got many great recordings from it. Battery lasts forever, especially if you remember to turn the mic off when not in use, but even if you don't!	1

There are more expensive headphone models out on the market like the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/beyerdynamic-DT-880-Premium-Headphones/dp/B000F2BLTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">beyerdynamic DT 880 Premium Headphones</a>, but those are so high end that I wouldn't personally gig with them, for studio or audiophile use I've heard they're great.

I've got quite a few microphones in my collection and they all have a purpose and a situation where they shine.  For this microphone that situation is when you're sitting around with a few friends and trading songs and stories.  I bought one because a friend of mine had one and had it paired up with a minidisc player.  I mainly use it plugged into a laptop with an external soundcard or directly into a mixing board.  It picks up sound from a small or mid sized room nicely for acoustic performances.  The stereo separation is nice, not too much and not too little.  The fidelity is amazing for the price.  As another reviewer pointed out, this microphone was used to record Lori McKenna's album&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Kitchen-Tapes/dp/B0000YKA8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">The Kitchen Tapes</a>&nbsp;which is very impressive in my book.  If you're looking for a microphone for podcasting where you need to cheaply and easily pick up multiple voices around a table this would probably work well also.  If you're doing podcasting or vocal work where everyone would have a separate microphone then you'll probably want to look elsewhere.	1
The mic puts out a low signal.  This is correct for use with Digital camcorders, most of which do not have a mic preamp in them so they require a pre-amped mic.  I plug this into the side input on my laptop sometimes and it captures a nice quality sound but the volume is low. I sometimes play guitar into this mic too (with the laptop) and again, the sound is good, but too quiet.  I have also tried plugging this camera into an external soundcard box (Firewire audio interface) and in this application it works nicely for capturing accordion.  I haven't tried it for vocals.  Probably the real issue is the audio-input jack on the laptop and perhaps the soundcard in the laptop as well.  External audio interfaces run on Firewire and USB2.0 and start at about $30.  The argument is that laptop soundcards underperform in recording use because the card shares resources with the CPU.  If you use a desktop you can plug a new soundcard into a PCI slot, or use an external box.  The argument for an external soundcard box with inputs/outputs on it flows along the notion that the fans in a PC are noisy so it's better to have the soundcard outside.  I agree with some of the other reviewer who say it has a bit of a "digital" sound to it.  Not a warm-sounding mic but nice to have and not expensive.  Seems very durable and of course it's quite compact.	1
This proven mic has come down in price, while the one below it--the Sony DS70--has remained pretty much the same.  For the extra 15 bucks, the Sony MS907 is easily worth the upgrade.  The only advantage of the DS70 is not having to worry about having a fresh battery installed.  The MS907 sounds fuller and richer, but frankly I did not judge it to be superior to the overall effect of the 4-point microphone that comes with the popular Zoom H-2.  Whether or not you choose to use it in place of the onboard mic of a high-end personal audio recorder really comes down to a matter of personal taste.  On the other hand, if you've picked up the new Zoom H-4n, this Sony stereo mic would be an excellent choice for complementing the onboard ones since the new Zoom allows for use of onboard and external mics simultaneously.  As for recording to a software audio program on an iMac, that particular computer has an audio input that will accommodate the 3.5mm plug (but be aware that many computers do not have such an input--in that case, look at a USB mic such as those from Blue).  Even with the right fit and a fresh battery, I found the MS907 to be somewhat underpowered for optimal results.  It wasn't until I plugged it into an Onkyo preamp that I was satisfied.  Again, I suspect that a mic with a USB connector would permit better gain levels with most computers.  There are adequate mic amps on Amazon for $20-$40, capable of boosting your signal by 48 volts, or 60 dbs. A Mac user willing to spend a bit more should look at the MXL Signal Booster Amp for Mac Computers, which costs a bit more but saves you the bother of USB conversion. Finally, if you're trying to make professional announcements for radio use, etc., you'll soon discover that, unless you're incapable of puckering (which means you're not much of a kisser), the plosives ("p" sounds) will run away with everything you try to say. The only solutions I've found are to write scripts that are devoid of plosives (the "voiced" "b" phoneme is almost as much of an offender as the voiceless "p" phoneme) or to pick up a "pop filter." The latter are little more than 6" circles of cheese cloth costing $20-$30 each, but I'm about to give in and order one from Amazon.  The last advice I'll offer is not to indulge in candy or a sweet soda while broadcasting. It'll thicken your saliva and make you sound like someone attempting to communicate with his dentist after being shot up with novocaine (or is it lidocaine, these days?)--in any case, it's sugar cane, and fuctose syrup, that will muck up your elocution, making your gums talk louder than your words.	1
I purchased this microphone to use with our canon video camera. We have used it to record several music recitals and band concerts and have been pleased with the audio quality.	1
I'm a professional piano technician and part-time musician. I use this mic (plugged into a Boss Micro BR recorder) for recording band rehearsals and gigs. It has a very nice clear, "transparent" sound quality and handles high volume levels with no problem.	1
This product came in a very timely manner, excellent price through Amazon, and resolved a little confusion along way.  The product itself is very durable.  My last one lasted three years, and it was used three times a day, and did receive abuse from my autistic son, and survived. Not as light weight as others but strong and a good choice for my family and life style.	1
I love these headphones, as well as the MDR-V600 headphones.  I believe the oil from your skin over time will cause the coating to slough off of the earphone padding skin.  However, since hygiene is of utmost importance, especially if more than one person is using the headphones, I have purchased some sanitary headphone covers.  This not only keeps the headphones clean, it also makes the headphone ear pads last forever.  Just an idea, but try using sanitary headphone covers on ALL your headphones.  I believe you can buy a bag of 100 on-line for about $18.00.  It's definitely worth protecting these wonderful headphones.  I use them in my home studio, and the frequency response is excellent, and I can hear every note, not to mention the exceptional large drivers (50-mm) that the headphones contain.	1
These work well to extend your boomwhacker set down an octave.	1
love to add these to my class sets of Boomwackers.  The kids prefer the ower sound.	1
These fit my boomwhackers well. The price was what you would expect, about a dollar and a half apiece. They appear to be durable.	1
Don't knock the recorder; it's a serious instrument if you take it seriously and don't blow as hard you can. Just takes a little effort to learn, like most worthwhile activities.	1
Bought this for my daughter's birthday. Without any prior experience playing a recorder, you may get some squeaks on the lower notes. That's common and easy to correct. Usually, you're blowing too hard or you're not covering the wholes tightly. Also, you can make a note sound sharp or flat by blowing too hard or by blowing weakly. It's a musical instrument. You have to LEARN how to play it. Go to YouTube for help. This recorder sounds clear and loud. Hole spacing seems correct. The holes are easy to cover and there is a clear distinction between notes. Thick plastic makes it feel durable, but it's very light weight which makes it easier to play faster (since you aren't using much hand strength and coordination to hold the instrument up). Like any instrument, it will require some practice to get the hang of it and get proficient, but this is pretty easy to play. Meaning, you can get a good, strong sound and play some simple songs on it right away. At the price offered at the time of this writing (approx. $9), it's worth buying 2 (so you can play along with someone else)	1
so long, i like it	1
I've had this recorder for 5 years and - don't get me wrong - there are awesome things about it!  First, it's nearly indestructible (and trust me, between me, the kids, and various pets we have tried to destroy this).  Secondly, you can indeed get very nice music out of it.  Not talking "Mary Had a Little Lamb" music but decent tunes with trills, etc. -  the experience of the player is what matters.  Third,  I like not having to mess around with the "playing in" requirements of nicer wooden instruments.  I can throw this recorder in a basket for weeks on end and then play it for as long as I want to play it without having to worry about it being humidified properly.  HOWEVER, the tuning of this instrument is frankly a little bit luck of the draw.  My recorder runs flat at the higher register (starting with high C and getting flatter as it goes). My daughter's Yamaha runs sharp in about the same area.  The tuning issue honestly isn't very noticeable if we're playing by ourselves, but is pretty awful sounding when we play together.  Now if you're really into ensemble work, you buy a nice wooden instrument and make sure the shop checks and fixes the tuning before you take it home. This is a mass produced recorder and - if you're buying it online - you get what you get. That said, it really is decent for the price and once you (or your kid) gets the hang of it, you can blow a little harder or softer to correct the majority of manufacturer imprecisions.  ETA:  Note that this recorder is the *Baroque* version, which is what my kid uses in school.  This means that the low F is split fingered (fingers down on left plus 1&3 on right... and yep, two fingers is good enough to sound in tune and easier to learn for beginners)	1
Hey, iT's a yamaha! Yamaha makes every thing well.. I love this recorder :)	1
good Product.	1
Great recorder ( for the price) . It got me back into playing recorder.	1
What a great deal.  My daughter plays this one when I play the slightly more expensive yamanah one.  This one is fine for anyone to learn on, I'm in my 30's and just started.	1
Good for any body. Fun to play	1
Great price.  Needed for a grade school music class. Quality instrument that sounds and plays as it should.  Rarely has Yamaha let me down with any product.	1
These were bought for my two sons who are using these in school for music.  I had to use them in school and remember using used recorders, and did not want my kids going through the same embarrassment.  Very nice product and quickly delivered.	1
For a cheap recorder they are in tune and sound good.  Give them as gifts to revive music in our culture.	1
I bought this for one of my students. She's very happy practicing every day with it.	1
This is just as advertised -- a solidly built student instrument.  After struggling with inexpensive dime-store varieties, it's a pleasure to work with.  I prefer wooden models but this is a good way to get started and I'll make use of it from time to time.	1
These are great!! they're durable and they do the job! no complaints here!! The instructions it comes with can be a little confusing but all you have to do is google "playing a recorder" and you'll find a plethora of info.	1
Not the most awesome instrument ever but at this price have to give it 5 stars, it has decent sound and seems very durable. Pretty easy to play, and they give you a little sack to put it in.	1
I first tried it,oh,35 years ago. Someone I knew from Bavaria played one. I tried thiers. 35 years latter,I got my own. It takes a little time for me to take up a new instrument,ha ha. The Yamaha recorder works fine and unlike the Yamaha fife I can get notes in tune,out of it. Worth buying.	1
Great 3 piece recorder that sounds great when played right :) I know you have all heard the screeches the kids can make with these!	1
This item delivers exactly as described.  The tone is wonderful and much better than other options which are only a dollar or so less expensive.  The price can't be beat.  We have both the Soprano and the Alto from the 24 series and I don't see how these can be beat except by instruments costing in the hundreds of dollars.  I highly recommend this product, I would buy it again if needed.	1
i bought this for my 5 yr old daughter, although she's just learning but it's a good start.  i recommend	1
I bought this for my daughter so she could practice over the summer.  She loves it!  It's good quality and the pouch that it comes in is perfect. I can't imagine anything better short of making it from real wood.	1
Great quality at a great price -  I make these available to my students at cost so they don't have to share the school recorders (yes i sanitize them daily).  They love all four colors - pink, green, blue, and ivory - and often trade with their friends to make multi-colored recorders to suit their individuality and creativity.	1
Bought as toy for grandson for his music collection. Holds up well to child handling. Also great tone for serious music.	1
This is a real instrument and I brought it to teach my grandson how to play. He thinks it's "neat".	1
This recorder is  good balance of quality and price. The color makes it look more like an instrument than a toy. It seems to have less moisture problems than the clear candy colored sopranos.  This instrument is easy to clean with  a mild non bacterial, non hand creme dish liquid or in the dish washer with the 3 parts all standing up on pegs.	1
I have had a Yamaha Recorder for 15 years. I recently bought this for my friend who likes mine. I am a loyal yamaha consumer. Cant go wrong with it.	1
This seems to have much better sound than the even cheaper plastic recoder it replaced.  It is well made and has good sound for the price.  (Key words here are "for the price".) Don't expect it to compare to and "real" wooden instrunment.  It does it's intended job well - teaching kids the basics of music but I gave 4 not 5 stars because it still hast that "plastic" sound quality but I doubt any inexpensive plastic recorer would be better	1
It seems to me everyone got exceptional instrument except me.  I don't understand what's so great about this guitar.  Action is just horrible.  I mean, look at 12 fret its 10 millimeters.  I don't know much about classical but it is not what I would call great playability.  Of course, you can play on this guitar, I do.  But it's hard.  I suppose, one shouldn't expect much from $100 dollars instrument.  But I repeat, it's not great.  Now about bass strings.  They sound bassy, as I suppose, they must.  But the thing is their bassines overpower trebles. Trebles sound unproportionally weak. And yes, yes.  I did changed strings on a good ones (D-Adario normal tension something) upon getting this guitar from Amazon  I should say though that guitar starts to sound much better now than it was when I just got it.  But action on this instrument still kills my fingers.  I do finger pushups in order to develop muscle on my phalanges, in order, to play on this guitar somehow.  Of course, I could ask professional to fix bridge nut, but why would I do it for such cheap guitar.  My verdict-unless you want to develop your fingers, in order, to pull out nail with your bare hands, go for it.  I will send it back, and buy myself inexpensive Spanish brand.	-1
It came fresh new in box. In very great condition. Loved it overall.	1
Surprisingly high quality.	1
I've had this guitar for nearly five years now, and it's been absolutely excellent throughout. As a primarily electric player, I find myself reaching for this guitar much more often than I reach for my much more expensive Seagull entourage rustic steel string acoustic. I have played much more expensive classical guitars, and, though they may feel slightly better, they sound about the same, and offer the same range of tonal possibilities (maybe a true classical guitarist might beg to differ, but for the occasional gipsy kings play along, latin jazz/bossa nova, and Bouree in E minor, it is quite acceptable). It comes rather decently set up out of the box, as I've never had to change a thing, it takes abuse rather well, sounds and looks pretty good, and definitely won't break the bank. It's definitely a guitar that you won't be afraid to take places, and will never regret bringing along if you do. For the beginning guitarist, someone starting out in classical, flamenco, or fingerstyle, or anyone who's looking for a very playable inexpensive instrument to add to their collection, this instrument really fits the bill.	1
Bass note are vibrant on this. The trade off is the higher notes are a little less audible than I am used to on different wood types. A welcome change though, and easily rectified by adjusting the pressure used when playing higher notes. Overall, nice instrument. VERY LIGHT.	1
This is a nice entry level guitar at a good price.  The service from the seller was great.  I did replace the strings with some better ones than what came on it and it improved the sound and ease of fingering.  I would recommend this guitar for anyone just starting out and wanting to play a classical type guitar.	1
I always loved these Yamaha Classical Guitars. Perfect sound, easy to play and very inspirational. Well constructed, does not buzz, nice neck and body finish, I would change the strings, makes it sound better. It is my main composing guitar at this point, I simply love it. Why the four stars....well because there are way better guitars out there, but for this price, you simply cannot find a better nylon string anywhere. Perfect addition to my collection. Buy One	1
I review this guitar based on its features versus price. If course, it is unfair to compare a 140$ guitar with a 1000+$ guitar. I got this one, very old, from a friend who gave it to me. It has very high action, hard to play, etc.. all the bad things some reviews mentioned about here. That's why my friend gave it to me. I went thru the set up myself to lower action at the nut and action at fret#12. Now it plays really smooth, easy on my fingers. This is not something a casual guitar player or newbee knows. Most string instruments, when newly bought, need to go thru a setup to be playable. Sometimes you are lucky that the action is low enough and this can be skipped. The sound is good for this price range. It does not sound as good a a few 5000$ I had chance to play and that's all expected. I even go further to install a preamp/under-saddel transducer to turn it into electric. Plugging into an amp, it sounds amazing. I can play, amplified, on stage with it.	1
I got this guitar 2003 and seven years later it still has an amazing sound. This guitar has a strong neck and keeps its tune for a long time. Many people have played this guitar and just love how it sounds. This guitars quality is as good as any classical guitar, the price is a good deal. You won't regret buying this guitar. I use Augustine classical guitar strings, I also use Pro Arte (Normal Tension EJ45C) classical guitar strings which sound really good (highly recommended). For those who are first time guitar buyers...NEVER put steel strings on a classical guitar because the neck is not strong enough and it will bend or snap. Classical guitar strings are nylon. Keep guitar away from extreme heat. This guitar looks nice and has a gloss finish. The neck is not too big or too small, it's just right. Handling is good and has a white mark indicating the 7th fret where you can easily see it.	1
I recently took this guitar off the wall rack in my home studio where it sat for 2 years and played it and  stayed nearly in tune, it was only a flat from standard E tuning. I always like this guitar better from more expensive because price, quality, and tone. Upon purchasing this guitar, cuz I neeeded for a classical class that I took back then, I changed the strings to D'addario pro arte hard tension and the sound gain a richer tone. Even my instructor who was a hardcore classical player noticed. Im so happy with my Yamaha, So glad that I purchase it instead of a $fifteen hundred dollar Ramirez..	1
When I was 15 years old I bought this same or similar Yamaha Classical Guitar model. It was one I bought used from a friend's guitar teacher. I loved that guitar. Never did I have a single complaint about it. And I had it with me everywhere I went until I was almost 40 years old.  My son was an avid electric guitar player who wanted to give acoustic a try. Since I didn't have time to play my guitar during that time of my life I LENT my guitar to him. When I eventually had more free time and wanted to get back into my music I asked my son to please return my guitar, the one I let him BORROW. It was at that time he informed me that he SOLD it to a buddy when he needed money buy a Fender bass. Kids...  So...I bought this one and am very happy to have a Yamaha Classical Guitar back in my possession. The only differences I can see between my old one and this one are the colors and design around the sound hole and the absence of Yamaha on the headstock. To be sure this was the brand of classical guitar I wanted, I tried several different brands and models available on Amazon.com at local guitar stores.  Every other brand of classical guitar, regardless of the price, did not hold up to the sound of the Yamaha guitars. I'm not saying the other brands did not sound good. What I'm saying is the Yamahas sounded great. Should I ever decide to upgrade to a better classical guitar, I will stay with Yamaha.  I could not find a lower price for this model than the Amazon.com price...anywhere. Having the Free Shipping option was a major plus.  There is only one reason I needed to call the Yamaha Customer Support Line. I needed to ask where the serial number is located. I couldn't find it to save my life. On the C40, look inside the sound hole to the inside edge of the fretboard.  My guitar was wrapped very well for shipping. It came with "The Yamaha Guitar Quickstart DVD." The DVD has some very useful information to help you get started if you have no idea what to do with your guitar once you take it out of the box. A "Welcome" sheet with some good basics for beginners was also included.  It is so good to have another Yamaha Classsical Guitar back in my life.	1
If you read this it means you in the same point where I had been some time ago and I hope my advise will help you as much as the same advise had helped to me.  Essentially it is pointless to discuss some hypothetic "classical guitar" on the web. In the same way as all we, people, have the same hands, legs and heads but have different nature and voices, the guitars, even of the same model of the same manufacturer may differ wildly.  The Classical guitar has to be made of wood. And wood, even of the same age and tree has much of personality and much of "specifics in sound.  If you consider this guitar you are shopping in the lowest end for cheap instrument. Well do not do it! Because I doubt you will learn it ever.  First of all buy the real Spanish guitar. I mean Spanish made in Span not the "Spanish" made in China or anywhere else. Spanish guitars, even the cheapest made toward sound, not toward look. Do not buy guitar with laminated top, it will sound as a toilet sitting and you never will be able to get decent sound out of it. The quality of sound is very important while playing classical guitar and you produce the sound with your hands. It is crucially important to learn to produce right sound by positioning fingers and nails properly: you will never learn it with cheap, not authentic guitar, because it will sound the same whatever you will try! It is like a car that make only left turn. Then you will try to play the real guitar not the bogus one , you will find youself incapable to make it sound as other players do.  Do not try to choose guitar yourself because you can't produce any reasonable judgment until you will learn how to make it sound properly, you must take someone who actually knows how to play classical guitar. You have to get  a decent instrument because you MUST fall in love with the sound of one, otherwise it is pointless: you play guitar because it fascinates you esthetically. I doubt that toilet sitting sound out of shipping box that pretends to produce music will fascinate you!  Once again, Spanish guitar improves with an age but not one with the laminated top. If you in budget, do not trash you money with cheap Chinese garbage but save more instead and by the real thing.  Here we are, these are my recommendations for those who really seek to learn to play classical/Spanish guitar:  1. Do not buy guitar online, buy it in the local Guitar Center for example! Listen to the actual instrument. If you like the sound take it!  2. Do not buy guitar with laminated top, they are guitar only by appearance.  3. Buy Spanish guitar from Spanish manufacturer, they start as low as $250, roughly.	-1
I love this product's guarantee-- if defective, just walk into a store and get a replacement.  Amateur use, so have less judgment as to its performance characteristics.	1
monster makes the best cable i ever used its so tough compared to other cables. it has a life time warranty i love	1
30ft is a practical length for live performances and in the studio. I have always been a fan of monster cable quality and design. Personally, it's the only cable I buy. Some might t honk the name is not worth the price. In a lot of cases that's true but not with this stuff the "100 series" microphone and instrument cables are excellent quality at reasonable prices.	1
Monster cable has never let me down, I will never go with any other cable because of the monster quality and reliability.  These cables provide the best and nothing less, because they are made well and they are built to last.	1
Especially at this price. Connectors feel SOLID like they can take a bit more abuse than others in this price range.	1
Really Great Product, soildly built, More than happy with perfomance, and I would ecomend this product to everyone who has a need....Its all Good!	1
Despite all the criticisms I have read over the years about Monster cables, I can't say anything bad about this cable.  All sounds recorded through it were crystal clear and had great sound quality.	1
I needed a fairly long mic cable to reach from my drums to our PA board. This is perfect. The cable is high quality, the XLR fittings appear sturdy and I expect they will last a long time. The signal does not sound not degraded. I am pleased and would recommend this cable.	1
They cables are pretty awesome. I have friends (musicians) that love these cables also.  I picked up 3 of these (two 50ft for my SM58 Beta A Mics and a shorter 30ft one for my Guitar Rig/Pedalboard) after growing tired of failing cables! Just last Sunday a cheap XLR cable that connects my Mackie Monitor failed in the middle of a gig! I couldn't hear myself on stage...  I've had these Monster cables for about a month so far and they seem great... Flexible but sturdy!	1
Our choir bought some house-brand microphone cables from that website that claims to be a friend to musicians.  They barely outlasted the warranty. We proposed plopping down nearly 4 C-notes on a dozen 20-foot Standard 100 mike cables to our church's finance council.  The words "Lifetime Warranty" were the clincher.  Hum? Forget about it. Cell phone static? Thing o' the past. CB radio interference? Tunes it right out. The secret is twisted pair construction, which eats up an extra inch or so of wire per foot of finished cable. The signal becomes its own electronic shield against noise. Cheaper cables use a side-by-side or linear configuration.  It saves wire and keeps the price down but the cable acts as an antenna and attracts all kinds of electromagnetic junk from the air.  The jacket resists twisting and uncoils smoothly. It also rolls up for storage without fighting back like a snake that's had a few espresso shots.  The ends are finished with somewhat oversize connectors, providing a generous grip for smooth insertion and removal, but they can be a hindrance for performers who like a grab a mike off the stand and solo. That's not a problem in a church choir, so we expect the cables to last a long time. If you need a cable with a slimmer connector, move up to the Performer 500 or Studio Pro 1000 series.  The finishing touch in our sound setup is the Monster Cable S-100 instrument patch cord and an attenuating adapter for hooking our mixer to the sound system. Velvety-quiet signal transfer and audio quality that's good to the last note.  We have yet to use the Lifetime Warranty but the peace of mind is, well, as good as a gift from God.	1
Perfect for my Epiphone Sheraton II.  Monster cables are well constructed.  I have several and never had any problems with any of them over the years.  Got this one because I wanted the 90 degree plug.	1
Like most other Monster products, this cable appears to be well made and reliable.  I bought it for my son's guitar.  It is the first instrument cable I bought from Monster, having used some of their audio cables before.  I would recommend this cable - it is reasonably priced and as stated above, well made.  Also it comes with the typical Monster warranty and some little inserts of various colors so you can add them to the cable end to distinguish the cable from others.	1
I have used monster cables for years, and with good reason. The lifetime warranty is worth the price alone. Simple fact: cables break, but getting to replace them at no cost is where it's at.	1
Monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either. This isn't their top of the line series but it works great with my bass guitar rig and has for some time. You cant go wrong with Monster Cables.	1
So good that I bought another one.  Love the heavy cord and gold connectors.  Bass sounds great.  I just learned last night how to coil them up.  I guess I should read instructions more carefully.  But no harm done, still works great!	1
Monster makes a wide array of cables, including some that are very high end. I initially purchased a pair of&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Monster-Rock-Instrument-Cable-21-Feet-Angled-to-Straight-1-4-Inch-plug/dp/B0002E38B2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Monster Rock Instrument Cable - 21 Feet - Angled to Straight 1/4-Inch plug</a>&nbsp;to use with my keyboards, but when it came time to purchase cables for my bass and guitar I thought I'd pinch a few pennies.  I am so glad I did.  I compared this cable model to the more expensive models I previously purchased and, aside from looks, could not detect any difference in sound. I Swapped back and forth between my guitars and keyboards, ensuring that each model was used on each instrument - still no difference.  What the more expensive model has going for it is looks. I am not sure it (the higher priced model) is even more sturdy because the molded stress relief ends on this model seem to make it more reliable than its pricier sibling.  Bottom line: carefully compare both cables using your own instrument and amp - if possible - before making a purchase decision. You may find, as I did, that higher price does not necessarily equal higher value, even from the same manufacturer.	1
Does exactly what I bought it for, works Great, very happy	1
Works just like it should! No problems.	1
good product, good seller	1
I'm guessing it works.  Found out my keyboard doesn't have a volume pedal jack, but the one I am buying soon will--so I kept it.	1
Ive used this pedal with our theatre keyboard and finally broke down to get my own! Very durable.	1
Nice, solid pedal. Built to last. Works as advertised.	1
DOES NOT WORK WITH LINE6 Equipment. Not Yamaha's fault.	1
Good product	1
Nice action; comfortable; stable.	1
Great price and fast shipping. What else can you say, FC7's are the best bang for your buck.	1
Works great.	1
was a package deal with Piano and stand, thanks again, daughter loves it	1
Solid build, I use it to control midi functions on my laptop from my bluetooth floor pad.	1
Works right out of the packaging. No complaints.	1
Excellent quality build for an inexpensive pedal.  Doesn't have the resistance feel of the more expensive Yamaha pedals, but perfect for casual sustain.	1
Yamaha's equipment is always first-rate.  I've used other expression pedal, but nothing feels like the quality of the Yamaha.  You pay more, but you get it all back in being able to use the equipment for many years before replacing.	1
Not reversable, you have to open up to get it to work with some devices. Yamaha flips the polarity.	1
No switch for different types of keyboards. Other than that, this is a very durable pedal.	1
Good proctor from a good seller!	1
Nice compact, authentic keyboard pedal. Used perfectly for Yamaha and Roland keyboards!	1
Perfect.	1
Doesn't work and seller won't accept a return.	-1
For what you pay, this is a great pedal. (Got a discount with Prime) I was expecting to receive a dinky pedal about the size of my hand. This is a sturdy large pedal, even wider than my guitar wah pedal. I bought this for use with my Yamaha Reface.  This is a great buy for amazon Primer's.	1
Love the feel. Perfect. Highly recommend.	1
they are perfect!	1
It's a pretty good pedal but I was disappointed that there was no way to adjust the sensitivity directly on the device like other pedals I've had.	1
Good solid Pedal but NOT SWITCHABLE.  Polarity is normally closed.. Make sure you can use it.  This is not so much a complaint against the pedal but against the writeup here.	1
Works great and came in one day!	1
Good Product	1
useless for guitar amp	-1
Works well with my Yamaha keyboard; like the heavy weight & feel.	1
Works great with Yamaha StagePas systems for controlling effects on and off!	1
good for voluming and expressing, has a nice amount of travel between totally off and full volume	1
I love these flat FC5 sustain pedals.  They are much more durable the standard pedals.  Although I still have an original Yamaha pedal that I purchased back in 2002 and it still works perfectly till this day, I'm a little more partial to this one now.  I've been using this pedal for 2 years now and I haven't had ANY problems with it.  I bought this one to keep in my laptop gig bag, in case of a faulty pedal when I do gigs out.	1
Love it	1
Perfect accessory to YPG-235, though works with numerous Yamaha keyboards. Follow instructions for proper setup.	1
;_;	-1
Good choice.	1
Great pedal for the price.	1
PERFECT PEDAL.	1
Great quality	1
Perfect.	1
good product	1
Tried an off-brand, Cherub. hated it--cable broke where it goes into the housing, and it felt light and cheap. Bought this one by Yamaha. Love it. Works as it should. I have a Yamaha keyboard.	1
REAL GOOD	1
This pedal totally surprised me with its ability to outperform the expression of a Hammond B3 that I'm incorporating into my musical setup. Very impressed!	1
Very good quality and built. Affordable and reliable for heavy users.	1
Excellent! ! Good deal! !	1
My girlfriend used to play piano, but we don't have room for one in our apartment, so I bought her the Yamaha P115 88-key Digital Piano and FC4A Piano Sustain Foot Pedal. Set them both up in our bedroom and the result is amazing. The resistance on the keys is great, it feels like a real piano, and it's small enough to fit next to our bed in our fairly small bedroom with no issues. Audio quality out of the built-in speakers is pretty good, but of course we could always hook it up to a better sound output if we wanted. It was a little pricy, but it's worth it if you need a piano in a small space.	1
The Yamaha FC3A foot pedal works as advertised, as I use it for my Yamaha MOXF8 with sounds that's able to use half-pedaling (Pre1 Full Concert Grand). You have a bit of travel on the pedal before it actually registers (I have to go almost halfway down before I notice an effect), and the half-pedaling effect seems to go to a full pedal early (Don't hear much a difference between 3/4ths and fully depressed pedal). If there was a way to adjust the sensitivity on this pedal, I would definitely give it 5 stars. It's well worth having one of these, especially if you have another pedal plugged in alongside it, though I would want to test one against the original Yamaha FC3.	1
Works great on my Roland keyboard. I recommend it.	1
This works great!  So much better than the cheap plastic pedal that comes with the Yamaha 650 piano we bought.  Other people have commented that the pedal is stiff and too high off the floor for their feet.  I think it's just fine.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase.	1
Nice for the price	1
The sustain pedal has a nice grip on the bottom which allows it to stay in place while other products have their pedals sliding all over the place because there is no gripping on the bottom. The pedal has this certain pressure to is when pressing down on it, which I personally like. You can rest your foot on it and it won't sustain unless you apply more pressure. All in all, it is worth the buy.	1
These pedals work very well for my Yamaha drum machine....and they last for years if taken care of.....:~)	1
Worked perfectly. I hope it will last longer than all the other non-Yamaha pedals that imploded through the year.	1
works. feels solid	1
Excellent, just as expected.	1
Worked perfectly. Getting another one for my 6	1
Works well with my Yamaha p115. I can get subtle variations on the dampening that I could not get with some of the cheaper pedals on the market.	1
Have 2 of them now, working flawlessly. Much cheaper than most competitors, too.	1
Pretty good pedal. Performs how you would expect it to from the looks. Has decent resistance like a real pedal too.	1
works great	1
Great pedal	1
Having tried several different volume pedals, I have to say that hands down, this one is my favorite;  The action is very smooth; looking inside (when the pedal is up), it appears to be simply and well constructed.  In my opinion, the best things about this pedal are that it's heavy and substantial, and that the size of the pedal surface itself is big enough that it's possible to play with precise control. I've tried Korg and Roland products that have bad action, or felt like they could be kicked around on the floor like a tin can. This is not that pedal.	1
This Yamaha Sustain pedal FC4A is very durable.	1
Took one star because it is not as sensitive as I would want it to be (have to really push it down). But it deserves all other four, since it works fantastic when you do get a handle on how hard to push it down. It is heavy, sturdy, and doesn't move around. Great sustain pedal (using it with the Yamaha NP31 76 key piaggero digital piano). Great sound.	1
Ok	1
So I have had this awesome sustain pedal on my Yamaha keyboards since Christmas and I have put this pedal through the gambit of abuse while playing in my home studio and out on the road and it is one tough unit. very rugged metal casing that has a rubber cover over the top part of the pedal that moves for your sustain. the cord that comes with it is the perfect length to route the pedal to wherever you need it located. Like I said I have borderline abused this unit as any working musician normally does with their gear and this thing is built like a little tank and has served me very very well, and I would definitely recommend this unit to anyone who needs a sustain pedal for any type of keyboard. This particular unit is actually pretty nifty and small compared to a lot of the other units on the market which are bulky and cumbersome and take up a lot of room when packing up especially when you have limited space in your flight case, but this guys fit right in with my keyboard flight case in my extra storage compartment	1
Works perfect with my old yamaha keyboard at school.	1
Solid and quality product.	1
What a difference from the silly little foot switch that comes with the piano.	1
works good	1
Just started to learn through independent study and online videos. This pedal makes me sound so much better than I am. It's a lot bigger than the picture; that's a good thing. It looks professional. I'm keeping it when I upgrade to the motif series of keyboards.	1
Works perfectly with my keyboard. Good weight and feel. Sturdy.	1
Nice item, good value,	1
Nice and smooth press, no clicking or noise when pressed.  Does exactly what it is supposed to do and appears to be built well.  Not cheaply made, should be a long lasting pedal.	1
It's great.	1
Heavy duty!	1
Good source	1
I bought two of these for a midi controler that I use for looping audio samples, and have set these to record and play the samples. They certainly have a hefty construction, and feel like you could back over them with a truck and nothing would happen to them. They are only switches, so there's not much to them, but the one piece of information that I feel I must pass on is that they don't have much travel, so they would not be a great option as pedals for a keyboard (they would work, but not well).	1
Gigging musician here.  I don't often get too excited about gear, but I gotta say these are excellent.  Heavy-duty build quality.  totally stage-ready.  Heavy weight and good padding on the bottom make this very stable for live performance. Mine have held up fine through numerous shows with no issues whatsoever.  A really nice feature is that they have a built-in physical connecting plate on the bottom that lets you join these physically together in gangs.  Some people might not like the heavy weight, but I love the heft.  No accidental kicking it around with stage antics, and built like a tank.	1
One of the best out there.  Long throw, and have had several.  Very sturdy	1
Great pedal, I've used this for keyboards, electronic drum pads, and midi boards. Solid construction, compact, I expect to have this pedal forever.	1
Perfect	1
heavy duty is an understatement, works great and very good quality, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, you will only have to buy one in your lifetime and oh yea! the best price in the market, could not find a used one anywhere.	1
it is very good	1
Yamaha quality!!!!	1
have had it 4 like 3 years and still kicking	1
so far so good. the pedal that came with my piano quit the first day I used it so I bought this to replace it.	1
Works perfectly after setting up the Yamaha DJX	1
EVERYTHING IS OK.	1
perfect  should have bought it years ago	1
Over the years I have had several. I always go to this pedal as long as the polarity matches.  It is particularly great for organ styles. as it is big, rugged, and has a long throw.	1
Just a basic pedal, I use it with my Alesis drum machine, works great, never fails.	1
Very rugged pedal, very well made and heavy. I took it apart and swapped the tip and ring wires on the potentiometer so I could use it with a Roland RG-33 guitar synthesizer. Works like a champ. Highly recommended; both the pedal and the seller. Would definitely buy again.	1
Made of metal, rubber-coated on top and bottom, and tough, this pedal functions perfectly with Yamaha PSR-e303 keyboard.  (As others have stated, plug in pedal, THEN turn on keyboard so polarity is correctly set on boot-up.)  I expect this pedal will outlive the keyboard it was purchased for, as it is surprisingly rugged for this price point.	1
Good	1
Delivered on time and as described.	1
Works great and perfect for  my Yamaha YPT-320 which I bought used but just needed something with a simple plug in that enhances the sound. Love the pricing on Amazon and it was delivered ahead of schedule so what's not to like?  Would recommend highly.	1
Excellent	1
Good.	1
I use two of these to trigger my Alesis SR16 for live performance.  Works great!  Very solid/durable/etc.	1
I bought this to use with an old Yamaha SPX90. It works great. My only complaint is that it only has one function. It would have been better if there was a way to go forward AND back but that is more an issue with the SPX90 design than this pedal. The chord could also be longer.	1
Excellent Product, thank you!	1

Good sustain pedal for my Yamaha keyboard.  I prefer the wider and bigger pedal to the narrower ones so that they are easier to find during performance.	1
This is the best expression pedal you can buy.  I had owned one previously, loved it, and unfortunately sold it because I wasn't using it any longer.  Sure enough, I needed one again, and borrowed a few other make/models from friends over the past few months.  None of the others felt solid, and they lacked quality.  One of them, another name brand, didn't even work consistently.  So, I found myself buying the pedal I knew would work and be of high quality.  The Yamaha FC7 is road-worthy, has a great feel, consistency in how it tracks, and will last you for a VERY long time.	1
As advertised and speedy service.	1
Very good	1
nicely weighted & feels great to control.	1
Still the best expression pedal out there! Have several of them and they contain a small plate at the bottom to link them together. Has to be required to use on some CV value devices.	1
Excellent product 100% recommended seller	1
Been using this particular model Yamaha volume pedal since the 1980s. This is the same pedal that was included when a Yamaha keyboard (like a DX7 or KX88) was purchased. These days you don't get accessories for "free" when a keyboard is purchased ... but the FC7 is fairly priced and solidly built - so well worth it. I just recently replaced one that I had been heavily using since the mid-1980s ... so they last. The pedal feels good under your foot and it is smooth. If you use more than one, they can be conveniently attached together. The FC7 is one of those rare musical products that hasn't been cheapened over time. I've used it with countless brands of electronic keyboards over the years - so it works with any keyboard that has a pedal input.	1
I got it to have it if I needed it. I have found that i don't really need it that often and rarely use it. If I was really good I can see the need. But this is a keyboard not an organ.	1
Superb quality as expected, if you're familiar with this brand then you know what it's all about, couldn't ask for more.  Thank you Amazon for selling professional music gear on your site. I dread the thought of stopping in my local Guitar Center to buy anything. Anyone that's had that experience knows what I'm talking about. Received it in just a couple days in flawless condition right to my door. No traveling around and haggling with vultures who work off of a commission.	1
Nothing I have ever bought with the Yamaha name on it has ever disappointed me. This was no exception. The packing was excellent, lightning fast, and the seller kept me informed. Highly recommended	1
Using this on 73 Key Controller emulating a Hammond and able to get all the expression out of the software which previously was not possible	1
I bought this to use with my Tyros 4 and it worked just great.  I replaced the Tyros 4 with a Tyros 5 and the pedal works great with the Tyros 5.  It is an excellent made product that should last a lifetime.	1
So far, this footswitch is working very reliably and is solidly built. It's probably helpful to place some velcro (hook side) to keep it in place on carpeting.	1
I've been using this pedal for about 6 months now with my Yamaha ES6 and it's been great not having to move my hand away from the keys to adjust the volume while playing.  In one of the old reviews somebody mentioned that it's hard on the foot when you want to access the entire range. I've found a way around it. I rotated the pedal 180 deg, so that when I press with my toes - it gets more quiet, and when I press with the heel - more loud. This way I avoid this awkward foot position when it's fully muted. It only took about 10min to switch my brain and use it in reverse. And I'm not changing back - it works and it's very comfy.	1
I got it to use with my new Nord Stage keyboard.  It didn't function at first, but my boyfriend rigged it with cables to reverse the polarity and it works fine now.	1
It works great with my Korg Krome-88 Synth. Just have to hook it up to the foot pedal jack & tweak the global settings in the keyboard.	1
PERFECT	1
I purchased this pedal for a Yamaha SY77 which is a keyboard from the early 1990s. I used to have one back then, but sold it to get newer ones. Recently I saw one on Ebay for a VERY cheap price from a good seller and in great shape. I then decided, I wanted to get another one as I really enjoyed it.  The FC-5 sustain pedal is the one that goes with this style keyboard. The pedal is very durable and functions the way it should. It is a good price for a genuine Yamaha pedal. If you need a FC-5 pedal then by all means this pedal is the one to get.  Works great. Highly recommended.	1
I ordered the Yamaha FC-5 as new but got what looked to be a returned item that someone didn't want or need. However, the item looks as new and works as new so I'll not return for a "new" one. If you need a sustain pedal for most any keyboard that accepts them this is a nice product at a reasonable cost.	1
I bought this to use with my keyboard. I wasn't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals. It doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano, which is what I'd always used. Doesn't have the same feel either. Nowhere close.  In my opinion, a sustain pedal like the M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action or other similar pedal is a much better choice. The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better. The only thing I've found the Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where I keep my electric guitar pedals.	-1
I got everything I expected out of my order for a good price and the product shipped fast. This pedal works excellent with my old Yamaha electric keyboard!	1
I use this while gigging with my MOX6.  Sturdy, built well, and works just like you'd expect.  Gives me the full volume range with good micro-adjustment.	1
I love it, I used this for my Yamaha ypt-230 and it works great, I would recommend it to anyone	1
works s it should and it doesn't weigh too much. It could be smaller and a little cheaper, but no big deal.	1
Pedal is made real good Not like some of the other  junk light weight Pedals I sent back., Con just a little But not a problem..  Love it. Would buy again,	1
This is a well made high quality pedal so have no doubts on the quality of construction. Yamaha is VERY good.  Worked just fine as an expression pedal for my Zoom 505II.  The only thing is that if you're using this with a Digitech processor, it won't work normally.  You need a "continuous control" pedal for Digitech devices.  Good luck!	1
Controls volume by default and works well.  We purchased to set it up in the keyboard settings to change rotary speaker speed on organ setting.  Works well but keyboard settings tricky... but this is the keyboard's fault and not the pedal.	1
works as adversited.  use it in a live stage situation, price was right, bought one for the other keyboard player in the band too.	1
It works well. No polarity switch - would not work with Casio. Keep swinging and playing music  Fats Waller is the best!	1
Got this for my Yamaha EX5 in addition to the FC3 and FC7. I needed the whole set to setup different parameters and control to each. works great!	1
Got this guy and it works perfectly with my Yamaha EX5. Very sturdy in its construction. Great control/motion over the volume unlike other controllers that have a smaller range.	1
I was glad to have read other reviews that suggested we get this pedal right away for a kid who is used to having one on his piano. He uses it just fine. Really it would have been problematic not to have it!	1
I have two of these.  They are built like a tank, operate very smoothly.  I like the Fortissimo feature (spring return).  It is a very good value for the price.  The only negative I would give it is big.  I like the size of the Hammond pedal better, but that is just my preference.	1
I bought this to use in my home studio to control my midi keyboard. It does just what I wanted it to do.	1
Unlike other expression pedals available, Yamaha chose the "Keep It Simple Stupid" path. I'm glad they did, because this pedal is very sturdy and does it's job exceptionally well, without any fluff to inflate the price.  It's low cost, it's quality construction, and it does exactly what it says it does.  I didn't want to spend $150 on just an expession pedal (such as the roland), but I was wary of spending $50 on the moog or line 6, whose reviews are not exactly raving about their longevity.  I'm glad I found the FC7, it's a quality product at a very reasonable price.  Notes: * I am using it as the expression input for&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Electro-Harmonix-Deluxe-Memory-Boy-Delay-Guitar-Effects-Pedal/dp/B0039KA9G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Electro-Harmonix Deluxe Memory Boy Delay Guitar Effects Pedal</a>&nbsp;- works perfectly. * There is no switch to change polarity, so check compatibility with your device.	1
I actually purchased this to act as a foot pedal for a Yamaha Y-DD40. Helped me see just how bad my instrument skills were, however I highly recommend this product. I haven't tried any other foot pedal though. I will mention that it doesn't seem to have a sensitivity to it, just a single button press type.	1
Got this thing because of the great reviews.  Turns out it works flawlessly with my 2 digital processors as both a volume and expression (wah, trem, etc.).  I use it mainly as a permanent fixture on my custom made digital only effects board for guitar.  I love the size and shape of this pedal, so I made it a little more personalized by cutting a polished diamond plate foot pad to swap out the stock rubber cover that came with it.  These Yamaha pedals have been around for like 30 years and are still the same great quality made in Japan stuff I have come to expect from the tuning fork guys.  Rock on!	1
Built like a tank and does all it's suppose to do. Heavy construction which means it will last for years. I love my Yamaha products because there built with quality.	1
I didn't read the reviews before buying this pedal and so I was unaware of the always-on vs always off issues that people are having with some keyboards. Luckily, the pedal works perfectly with my MIDI controller, which is an old Roland PC-180A.	1
I can understand why folks who are most familiar or most comfortable with a pedal that re-creates the feel of what can be found on a real piano might not be thrilled with this.  But I just needed something to be able to get a sustain effect out of an old Yamaha DX21 keyboard.  This product did the job and works great.	1
I'm using this with a Yamaha YPT-300 and it works fine except that the pedal is very light-weight.  I kept having problems finding it with my foot or having it move.  I found a piece of wood 9"x16"x3/4" (23 cm x 41 cm x 2 cm) and mounted the pedal to the board with double sided carpet tape.  (Glue would work too.)  I even put little rubber feet on the other side of the board.  This setup works perfectly.  The YPT-300 senses the position of the mode switch when it is first turned on to determine if switch closed or switch open means sustain.  This means it doesn't matter with the YPT300 that the switch will not be accessible when mounted to the board.  Check your keyboard to verify this function and if it doesn't make this check, be sure the pedal mode switch is in the right position before gluing!	1
This is a cool looking cheap cable which works well. I bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault. One thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile. You'll be able to hear them rattle. It seems that the 'retro' look is screw on connectors over some black rubber, but other than that, the cable looks cool and works well.  I also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly. I bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables. It's easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident. The green cable is good for that.	1
Purchased in March 2013, this cord started not working in September of 2013.  It was used 1-2 times a week and was surely not the performance I would have liked from a Fender name.  That being said, we also have one we're using to connect a keyboard and that one is still working fine.  It must be the movement on the guitar that cause the other one to fail...right before a performance too!  :(	-1
This Fender cable is the perfect length for me! Sometimes I find it a bit too long but I don't mind. The build quality is great and I know that it will last. The only gripe I have with this cable is that the metal sleeve gets unscrewed way too easily, requiring me to tighten it often.  Sound quality is not affected, and the color is cool, definitely try this cable out.	1
Fender cords look great and work just as well. By adding the word California to the description I'm sure to sound like the Beach Boys...	1
wanted it just on looks alone...It is a nice looking cord... I know it will perform...as for Sam Ash ...this cord was packed in a mailer inside another box with my Roc n Soc... his shipping team do great work..never any complaints from me... I love Sam Ash.. thanks Amazon	1
Can't find any complaints at all..  Works and sounds as good as cables quite a bit more expensive...  Great for that vintage strat sound...	1
OK, I will say it, these cables just look cool in your rig. But beneath the flash you get a quality Fender product that is dependable and sturdy enough to take the punishment of life on the road. I use these between my guitar and effects and pedals to amp on send and return effects, no doubt of which cables are mine. Highly recommend.	1
I've been using these cables for more than 4 months and they are holding up pretty well.  For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend.  When they finally gave out, I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into.  After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables.  Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better.  I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable.  I don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable.  This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well.  These are actually very reasonably priced for 18' cables.  There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I haven't needed it.  Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!  Incidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp's input.  Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab.  You want to use unshielded cables for that purpose.  Edit-  More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues.  The price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended, there are probably better values from Hosa, Monster or Planet Waves-	1
Once again Fender doesn't disappoint.  These cables are the best, they improve the sound of my guitar tremendously.  It also eliminates some buzz I get when I hook up extra pedals.  Great cables, can't do wrong with a Fender.	1
This is a pretty nice cable.  It's very cheap for the quality of signal it passes.  The lining looks nice, but frays easily - more easily than other wrapped cables I've had. Because of the long, rigid plastic/rubber end of the cable, this is more suitable for an instrument with a front jack plate.  It won't be usable for bottom-mount if you want to be able to sit down and play.  Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.	1
its a cable.  Its red. It works. looks great with a red guitar.  even works fine for drum triggers.  Nuff said.	1
Very good cable. Well made and it looks great with my Candy Apple Red Tele. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because it tends not to lay flat on the floor.	1
Very nice guitar cables from CALIFORNIA CABLES! Bright red shows up on stage. No noise cables. Lifetime warranty. 18 feet long. They are made very well and should last for quite a while. Thanks guys! Get yours now at a great price. Get a couple for the musicians in your life for Christmas! HO! HO! HO!	1
MIDI cables are one of those things that either work or don't.  This works well and is very affordable.	1
Exactly as advertised.	1
Excellent.  I have had great luck with all the Hosa cable I've purchased.	1
I've been using these cables on my recording interface for my DAW and for synchronizing some of my synthesizers.  I've never had any issues with the cables, and I'm certain they'll be reliable in the long run.	1
Works and haven't had any problems with it.  hard to mess up a midi cable though lol	1
Great for recording E-drums into DAW.	1
Good accessory	1
The plugs have a solid feel; they aren't going to break off in the jack or anything. The cable does what I need it to do, so I'm happy with it.	1
They're MIDI cables. No errors and well made...what else could you want?	1
Do people use midi anymore? This people do!	1
OK	1
Perfect for the job	1
Not very flexible, wouldn't buy again. More like a network cable than an instrument cord. Gets the job done but Meh.	1
Great for the buck	1
This cable works like it should, is built with high quality components, and is priced very aggressively to boot. Can't top that combo.	1
I bought these because I really had too long of mike cords for my solo live show. And these are really nice cords if you have a home portastudio recording studio like myself. Who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place? I bought two because I use a Digitech Live 2 Harmony processor and two XLR mike cords are required to make it operational. Good price here too. Hard to find just 10' mike cords. Usually longer ones are only obtainable.	1
Not much to say ... great mic cable, decent thickness/gauge, haven't noticed any noise at all, it works. Never had any problem with Hosa stuff, which is why I chose this cable over others available in a 3' length. So, there you go!	1
Works great!!!	1
Cable stop working after a month, bogus cable.	-1
Works as expected	1
Just standard MIDI cables.  Work as expected.	1
excellent product	1
great but i should have bought longer ones	1
Cool does the job!,no problems	1
Can't say it's amazing quality but what it is is very functional at a very low cost. More than what you're paying for but you won't mistake it for a $20 alternative. It functions just as well as expensive alternatives from what I can tell.	1
as described	1
got it quickly.  Cable works well	1
Great product at a great price! I'd order again in a heartbeat!	1
I use this for live audio. I run it from my microphone to a vocal effects pedal so I needed a shorter length. I prefer the old-style silver switchcraft/Cannon style ends for their vintage look with my Shure 55H microphone. For recording, I'd go with a higher quality cable but this has been great in a live setting.	1
Horrible, stiff cables that are more or less locked in the position they came in. Other Hosa cables have more flex to them, which is what I was expecting here. Seriously, stiff cables are the worst.	-1
Works as expected	1
Arrived as advertised and on time.	1
thanks! it's wonderful	1
Works perfectly, no complaints	1
If you need a midi cable, this is the way to go	1
works great	1
good cable	1
cheap, but surprisingly good cable	1
Get's the job done.	1
great cable. Easy to tell which side is up.	1
Its a midi cable	1
Good cable. Works well. Sturdy.	1
These things just do not last...	-1
Works great.	1
Simply needed a microphone cable to to go from the back of my synthesizer to the telescoping mini boom that was attached to the 2nd tier of my keyboard stand. 3 feet is the perfect length to accomplish this.	1
Works as its supposed to	1
very good	1
good	1
Utility	1
These are just what I needed to make connections. At a stage now where I prefer the more durable midi connection verses the usb connection.	1
Excellent!	1
Can't go wrong with Hosa cables.  They hold up well.  Cheap enough to have extras too.	1
No issues with this purchase or seller.	1
Stands up to stage use for years on end. I've owned and lost a few of these.	1
Works fine with Yamaha keyboard and digital drums	1
great cables at a great price!	1
does the job	1
I am using this Hosa XLR cable on a mic preamp to sound mixer setup.  This distance needs to be kept short and this cable worked out just fine.  The price was most fair and the shipping was very fast, in my case.  Terminal ends seem real solid and the cable itself is of good quality.	1
Great Midi Cable	1
Excellent!!!	1
Works great - has the extra voltage pin required for Voodoo Labs Ground Control Pro	1
workes prefectly, great price!	1
Great Cable!	1
awesome	1
Cables work fine, very flexible..	1
The connector on the female end which connects to the Microphone is very loose!  2 out of 2 units I bought are loose like this.  Better off paying a few dollars more for the GLS Audio cables which have a much higher quality connector.  I'm happy with other Hosa cables that don't involve XLR connectors, but I will never buy Hosa XLR products until they switch to a higher quality.	-1
Great cable. I was worried about how cheap it was. But the quality is that of a $50 midi cable. It's a little less then 1/2" thick and the midi pins are very sturdy. I had a cheap on before and plugged it in crooked by accident and bent the pins. Should have bought this one in the first place. Works great with my M-Audio midi keyboard.	1
worked perfectly	1
The cables are what I need, we'll constructed and fit snug. I like my purchase and recommendations for all.	1
Works as advertised, specifically for a midi keyboard in my application and price was competitive.	1
Does the job!	1
It's a mic cable by Hosa, what else can I say? Hosa has been around for a long time. cable seems well made, we'll se about durability.	1
excellent quality and service	1
This item is as advertised.  Arrived quick.  Was packaged well.  Would recommend product and store front too.  Wanted Rean connectors (Long story), but they do the same job.	1
When you consider the cost of plugs and cable, buying these short lengths is actually cheaper than making my own.  Good value!	1
Can't say much, it's a cable...but cheap and works well. I got this to connect a few audio processing effects to my audio interface.  The cable is worth buying.	1
happy with the whole transaction, will buy more	1
It is an XLR microphone cable. Works as intended, very happy with the purchase to go with my MXL 770 Condenser mic.	1
They are well built and will last.  Miidi cables don't have to be fancy.  Get the length that best reduces your cable clutter.	1
They are good midi cables.  Well built and they last.  You don't need fancy cables for midi	1
Quality as advertised!	1
Not much to say about a 5-foot MIDI cable except that I've always been a fan of Hosa's stuff - it's fairly priced, works for years, and won't leave you wanting for something more expensive.  Fits perfectly into the 5-pin DIN jack on my Korg Volca Bass.	1
The cable works as exspected. Solid construction. Its looped up very tighty so it takes a while before it will lay flat. Thats abvery minor issue tho	1
Works well.	1
excellent. Recommended.	1
A great cable for the short distances.	1
Not much to go wrong here.  But works fine.	1
THis cable was tust length I needed to fit in portable mixer box. I need a short cord to hook up the computer to mixer and this 1 was just what I needed.	1
As advertised!	1
It works. It's cheap and it works.	1
Worked great for my needs!	1
Does the job of connecting my lighting controller to my Traktor Kontrol S4 so that i can use them together with my PC in my sets.	1
It works	1
works well with SDP-6 and Beatbuddy	1
Not a lot to tell, it is a MIDI cable. But it is constructed well with metal ends, and was reasonably priced. I would buy it again.	1
I play in small, cramped places and am always within 5 feet of my PA and pedal board.  It's nice being able to consolidate the equipment and cable clutter.	1
Awesome!  High quality .  I would recommend this to anybody.  Why pay more in a store when you can get it delivered to your door and for cheaper.	1
The cable fits snugly into the receptacle. Seems to handle audio just fine so I find it acceptable. Happy to place it in my kit.	1
Its a cord and has done its job , ive had no complaints so why not give it 5 stars	1
Hosa products are a good bang for the buck. I haven't looked up the specifications, but I'm guessing the wire is 22 to 24 AWG, but since it's only 10' long, it's good enough.	1
Cable is thick, heavy, doesn't kink, and has a quality feel. Strain resistance seems like it should hold up well under medium duty use.  The ends look like they open easily, so it can be made into a shorter cable should it ever fail. In my experience, most Hosa gear seems to be higher quality than the price would indicate.	1
I have never had a problem with Hosa cables. I use them for everything in my home studio. Well made and I've never had one fail.	1
High Quality cable.  The metal connectors seem more durable than others at this price range and fit snugly to the devices I use.  I have mine connected to my M-Audio Keystation Pro 88 and Focusrite Scarlett 18i8.  No signal errors are showing up.	1
No problems and everything as advertised.	1
Does what it does. Go MIDI	1
Just what I needed	1
I have a much longer cable but it's far too long for my current needs. I bought this cable as a shorter replacement. My only worry is the diameter of the cable is much smaller than my other cable. Leads me to wonder about its longevity. So far there isn't any issues though, and I take good care of all of my equipment	1
Works correctly	1
It's a midi cable and it works	1
excellent	1
Good price. Works great.	1
Awesome product! Still rockin' 2 years after purchase and working perfectly. Highly recommended!	1
Works perfectly after a year! Awesome deal.	1
I bought these to go from my board to the amp. We use them for a mobile church so they take a beating. They are still going strong.	1
I like Hosa and Rapco cables.  Never have any complaints on the quality and reliability.  Will definitely purchase more as needed.	1
This is a fine cable at a decent price point, nothing exceptional mind, but it gets the job done well enough.	1
Perfect short XLR cable.  I needed something short for a run from a desktop mic to a mixer. This is perfect. Cable is flexible. Fittings seem to be high quality.  Works fine.  Jerry	1
Good quality cable that should be be able to stand up to punishment on the floor.	1
Using to connect microphone to analog mixer and it functions very well.	1
Good product for price. Lighter duty, great for home use, not recommended for professionals.	1
Good price, great delivery!	1
Perfect for what it is!	1
ok	1
Strong cable, suits my needs. No complaints as of today.	1
It does the job. Proper length, quality is good.	1
Mega Cheap imported cables from China. The connectors are flimsy nickle finish - will oxidize in time.	-1
Great MIDI cable, reliable. The price is great and the cable allows you some freedom in positioning your equipment.	1
Been using for gigs on my midi foot controller and it's been reliable.	1
Worked as expected. My RC300 sent tempo info to my SR16 right away	1
As described.	1
I've used a lot of cables and I always come back to HOSA, they are indeed some of the best audio cables in their price range on the market.	1
This was exactly what I was after. I have a voice touch and needed a small cord to connect the mic to the voice touch and this was perfect. Before I used a 20 foot cord to go about 12 inches. I highly recommend this for those who keep the mic on a stand and have a voice touch or other stand connected device for vocals.	1
These are not the greatest but they're cheap and they get to you fast when you need them. I've only had one fail and I've bought many of them to use in our broadcast studio.  Amazon is the first place I go when I need cables for audio, video, computers or concert lighting.  Good music to all!	1
Hosa makes some of the best good quality, low price audio cables in the business.  I have probably bought over 20 Hosa cables for various applications in my Internet radio business.  Each one has worked flawlessly and been the best value.  I look for Hosa when I look for audio cables.	1
Needed a shorter cable. Couldn't find one locally but found one here on Amazon. Works great.	1
Great product	1
Works	1
It does what is expected of it.  The cord is nice and flexible.	1
Nice quality cable. Moldings around connectors are going to work out nicely. Not sure how long it will last with regular use. But I  will update this at that point. Packaging was of good quality as well. Price was right also	1
good product	1
works great.	1
Typical quality. Not outstanding.	1
Does the trick for my home studio.	1
:)	1
Basic Midi cable. I've had it for a month or two now and it's still working just fine. Sturdy construction no complaints what so ever.	1

Does what it's supposed to!	1
worked well	1
A good affordable replacement. Working well so far.	1
Works exactly like it's supposed to, not much else to say!	1
I've been more than happy with this cable. I have a spare bedroom converted into a home office and have been working on getting my keyboards and synths more integrated with my computer - my goal is to have a space where, when I have a musical idea, I can quickly get it put together and recorded. I use this 25-foot cable to run from my audio interface over to my music station where it connects to the first device in my MIDI chain. So far it has functioned flawlessly!	1
Thank you!!! Timely and I got exactly what I wanted.	1
Not the best on the market, and not the worst. Hosa is a go-to brand for decent quality at a fair price. Can't go wrong.	1
Work well and as it should. Thanks	1
Solid quality!	1
works great	1
Great experience!	1
Works great.	1
Worked fine, but it's a little thin	1
Use it every week at gigs.  Solid, no problems with the solder joints.  A good quality cable at a very good price.	1
This is the perfect price, size, and build for someone in need of a quick mic cable.  Length is perfect for most recording setups where a mic would be hooked up to a recorder or preamp.  I bought this cable because I purchased cables by the same manufacturer in the past.  No problems at all with this cable, very high quality!	1
Nice solid cables, with excellent support at the ends.  Should last a lifetime of usage no problem and just what I needed to connect my tube preamp.	1
There are times when a short mic cable is needed.  In my case, I use it for my wireless receiver to the mixer.  The quality is real good and the connections are snug for a good connection.  I have never had trouble with Hosa,	1
I've bought a bunch of Hosa cable and it has been nice in terms of quality and price. I needed a short XLR cable for a desktop mic setup and found this one. There isn't too much to say other than it works, is durable, and fits the bill nicely. It is actually quite hard to find premade cables this short and there aren't a lot of options. Luckily this one is also durable and cheap. Wouldn't hesitate to buy another if I needed it.	1
Good enough, they're ridiculously cheap, and they do exactly what they're supposed to do. Couldn't find better at this price point.	1
Exactly as described.  Perfect for my midi guitar pedals.	1
Connects midi equipment. Works as intended.	1
Just what I needed. Plug and play. No need for any setup. Just remember MIDI OUT goes to MIDI IN. And MIDI IN goes to MIDI IN and every thing just works!	1
These are really long, and they work.  What else is there to say?	1
does it's job	1
Works fine, but I should have just built one on my own with a neutrik connector.	1
This adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small DV cameras will function but with caveats.  First, it's construction is pretty light weight. That means you will have to be "gentle" with it when using it. That's something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up.  Second, the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it. This is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera. That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter.  So just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others. I went to Sam Ash music and found a similar adapter cable, heavy duty, and with a longer cable for the same price. It pays to shop around!	1
Great price and simple to use just plug and play for use with Xbox 360 Rock Band 3 Midi PRO-Adapter	1
Better than average quality for this price range.	1
Great functioning cable; perfect length needed for my application.	1
It's fair to say Hosa makes two types of cables for both audio and midi. The really, really cheap, thin, flimsy colored cables, or the Pro cables. Spend the extra few dollars and go the Pro route. It's still cheaper than the competition and you are getting a very comparable cable. The Hosa Premium midi cables have very thick, solid midi connectors that fit nicely into you midi ports and the cable will not easily come out inadvertantly. The rubber-like shielding around the cable itself makes it feel well protected and it won't kink. I use them in the studio but they would work well on stage. I believe the same to be true for their Pro audio cables.	1
No problems here	1
It looks really nice. It's one of the best MIDI cable I have ever seem.	1
You need a 10 foot midi cable? Well, this one is just that. It works well, had no bent pins, and does all the things a midi cable should do. Would buy again.	1
The metal connectors have a quality look. They are also pretty flexible. Now that I see how nice these are I won't bother with anything cheaper. Get them, you'll be happy.	1

Good quality for the money.	1
Just what I needed.	1
The quality of Hosa cables is really great for me, I'm a fan because they seem to be well made, sturdy, functional, and I trust they will last for a good while.	1
Perfect size for connecting multi-vocal effects units.  Well made connectors, quickly shipped and durable.  Purchased several of this size to cut down on excess cable line between units for recording purposes.  Highly recommended.	1
It suits my desktop recording needs perfectly. I would definitely order other cables made by Hosa. All in all a very good cable.	1
I use 2 of these for connecting a rack unit to a Presonus Firepod and they work great.  Sound quality is clear and I hear no extra noise or hiss.  I would buy these again in an instant if needed.	1
No need for a long review but it works. I'm using this for my Audio Technical AT2020 and I'm happy with it.	1
This was a gift - but I did hook it up for the receiver and the cable seems decently made,	1
Midi cable. Works as advertised.	1
Item as described	1
Great price good selection. Fast delivery as always.	1
This is a great cable...a little smaller in diam. than I expected but the metal ends are a big plus, and the overall length in this price range was fantastic!  Will be back!	1
Much nicer than the cheap plastic ended midi cables. Looks and feels better, but also locks into place a bit better.	1
HOSA Cables are as much a part of my music as the sounds themselves. I've used these cables for years and they've always performed 100%. This particular cable is your basic MIDI to MIDI cable which I use to connect my synth to my audio interface and it works like a charm!	1
In order to get the drums and all the keyboards hooked to the DAW midi interface and not have them all crowded in one spot, I use the 25 ft cables to give me some breathing room. Now all I need is a switch box to go back and forth from one midi controller to another.  Only works if you also have the 25 ft stereo headphone cable too !	1
Worked perfectly between an external microphone and camcorder. No noise.	1
worked	1
This product has a sticker in the back that says "California Proposition 65 Warning. This product may contain chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm".  I don't care how good the cable is if it's capable of causing cancer to you...	-1
I bought this cord after returning a cheap one that I should've known better than to buy. My son, who has some experience as a musician recommended the Hosa brand when I was seeking a proper replacement.  I bought it for a small home recording setup which includes a Behringer C-1 Condenser Microphone and a Behringer Xenyx 302 Mixer, and both ends make a reliable connection to both the board and the mic; the sound quality is excellent.  An excellent value for the money.	1
The build quality seems good, with descent-quality connectors.  I have used it to patch together audio gizmos.  I have not given much abuse, but it has worked fine in the home and for a half dozen gigs without failing.	1
The Hosa XLR cables are affordable and very heavily made. I have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere. I decided to purchase shorter cables and the Hosa cables 5ft measurement worked perfectly. You really will not be disappointed with these.	1
I was having problems with noise in a recording system. Replaced a 15 ft generic cable with this and the noise is gone. Maybe just going with a shorter cable was all it took, but this cable works great.	1
Good length - I can stretch it anywhere in my home studio. Great quality - The metal tips from Hosa are sturdy and easy to take apart if repairs are needed.	1
Hosa produces my favorite MIDI cables. These metal tipped cables are very durable, and if need be, they are easy to take apart and repair. Recommended purchase for your MIDI setup	1
I've been using this cable for a few months with no issues. Solid construction for an economy cable. Doesn't have the fancy name, but suits the purpose. Get one!!	1
Although the cable functions, I am not happy with the quality. My main gripe is that the rubber piece where the cable meets the connector fell out of the connector with almost no pressure whatsoever applied to it. The purpose of this piece is to keep cable bending force from getting inside the connector and damaging the connections between the wires in the cable and the connector pins (usually solder connections). With the rubber piece not serving this purpose, the cable is likely to fail much sooner than it should. I tried to force the rubber piece into the connector but was unable to. Maybe if I disassemble the connector... but hey, I shouldn't have to do that. Maybe this cable is OK for a studio where it is installed and never moved, but I would never take it out on a gig.	-1
Great cables; these are very sturdy, high quality MIDI cables. can't beat them for the price. i've only had them a couple of weeks so I cant speak to their durability but, i suspect they'll last unless I use them as ropes or something.	1

Not stereo.  This adapter delivers a MONO signal from a stereo AT microphone to the recorder or camera. Packaging says it's ideal for connecting a mic to a stereo recorder of camera but it's only ideal if you want MONO sound from your STEREO mic.	-1
Very bad XLR "MADE IN CHAINA"	-1
The 1-foot cable is not one foot. They count the length of the XLR connector and strain relief. The cable itself is only 9".	-1
Got it to use it on a microphone mounted on a camera it only has noise I do not recommend it	-1
Didn't work, sadly. No sound came out. Tried multiple mics to no avail.	-1
cheap and useless never got it to worck	-1
the 1/4 jack plug is a bit narrow.  I purchased two of these to connect my studio monitors to my mixer.. I have a large range of 1/4 cables and have never had a problem but the diameter of the 1/4 plug on these cables is simply to small.... they are not a tight fit into the socket and the sound can cut in/out.  of course..i had already thrown away the packaging...........sigh	-1
I bought two of these.  They're ok, but the rubber boot on both the cords keeps popping out of the metal housing.  They are not secured at all, making me believe the product is of substandard quality.  Not too hip on the angle either or the metal color.   If it were painted black, the boots didn't pop out all the time, and the 3.5 was strait, that would have been what I would have liked them to be.  They look kind of ugly.	-1
I bought this for my Canon Vixia HF G10 Video Camera and a Shotgun Mic that I recently purchased for it. I needed a 12" wire for it to be a perfect fit from my mic (which is mounted on the Mini Advanced Shoe) to the microphone plug on the Video Camera...  The wire on this thing is *not* 1 foot long. the actual wire is under 8" long itself. I would have returned this thing but it was cheap enough that it wasn't worth the hassle... I'd have rated it 1 star, but I tried it on my Nikon D3200 (Shoe mounted Shotgun Mike) and it worked out ok. Still a tight fit though (since there's only 8" of wire)...  I'd recommend anyone looking for a short cable go with a 2' adapter; worst case scenario, you can zip-tie a loop instead of getting angry that it doesn't fit.  Also, not sure if it's the wire (so this didn't affect stars) but I hear a hiss when recording. Again; unsure if it's the way the wires are stretched out to the max on the DSLR or not (or my shotgun mic).	-1
good solid cable, but tends to kink up on stage, which causes a need to unplug and untwist the cable. I wouldn't buy them again.	-1
I had minimal use on this cable and it lasted about two weeks. As a kid with no money I always used the cheapest cables I could find, when they broke I would take them apart and solder them back together. You buy better stuff as you get older and wiser, I've used monster cables for about 15 years and never had a problem, I needed a cable in a hurry and didn't want to spend the money on one that wasn't going to see much action, I should have just spent the extra money. If you are looking for a cable I would look elsewhere, you get what you pay for.	-1
This sounds bit smaller than expected for this price	-1
Cord seems to only intermittently conduct a signal.	-1
Seriously....when am I going to just spend the 25$ for a good chord instead of being upset by buying all of these cheap ones??  Straight out the box the jacks were bad, messing with my tone and volume if they turned or moved the wrong way.  Seriously terrible cable, but super inexpensive sooooo.....still bad cable.	-1
the cable hisses, crackles and pops right out of the package.  save your money and buy a better cable.  i will buy cables locally from now on so i can easily return them if they are defective.  i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else.	-1
Bought this years ago. It was a nice long cable that I bought figuring it'd be durable but it didn't last. Maybe it was my mistreatment of the cable but then again it should be built to gig... If I was better with wiring I'm sure it's fixable but all in all it didn't last as long as I'd hoped.	-1
Cable crackles when plug in jack is moved. GLS brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison. Both have tweed jackets however the Hosa cable does not uncoil easily where the GLS cable does. I would recommend the GLS product over the Hosa product.	-1
Spend the money on a better cable these are cheap, sound fuzzy, and break easily.	-1
very light use, here and there - now crackles BADLY and into the trash it goes - NOT recommended!!	-1
This cable lasted less then a week before it didn't work at all.	-1
Haven't even had a month and it's already shorting out on me.	-1
Returned it, very noisy cable.	-1
i bought this item about 3 months ago and have used it about 5 times..it gave up on me today completely.  i did not abuse or take it anywhere but used it a few times to play a few songs...no static noise or anything....	-1
i do not like it	-1
Didn't work out of the box.  The end connectors were loose and the cables are thin.  No sound from the guitar.  Other cables work. Spend a few dollars and get a reputable brand.  Glad I didn't bring these to a gig. Luckily I can return easily with Amazon.	-1
a little upset, because after one use and delicate handling, it no longer works. It did not even leave my studio, I will be inspecting it a little closer to see if can be repaired, I will do a follow up review.	-1
junk fall apart in your hand	-1
Does not work.	-1
This cable showed up on my doorstep and let me down right away. Within the first few days it cracked and popped and was put in the "crap" pile in storage. These cables are poorly constructed and just not worth the money at all. Pay a little more for something that works and lasts.	-1
This happened (check out my picture) in about 3 to 6 months of use. I guess you by cheap, you get cheap results.	-1
Cables do not connect effective enough to give a great sound. Connection is weak.	-1
the sound is really bad, wondering if I had a defective cable , for the price I not even bother to return.	-1
Given the good reviews, I expected more. Fairly flimsy, skinny gauge. The connectors unscrew very easily so need to be checked before use every time.	-1
Unfortunately this switch creates a large pop when switch on or off. For a DJ or game announcer it is entirely unacceptable to have a big pop every time the mic mutes or un-mutes. It would have only added a very small margin to have done this right. The engineer in me wanted to take it apart and add a resister and cap to fix the problem. I chose to return it.	-1
I'm a pro-cheapo and I hated this thing. They're noisy, and the cables feel really cheap, gummy-like. Drop few more bucks and get something else!	-1
Already broke? within a month of having this cable? maybe I got a lemon, but it seems like these things are not durable. The cable didn't break in half, but there's static and the signal is not going through. Worked in the beginning though. Bummer to post a bad review but that's what happened.	-1
No low end.	-1
Works like it should.	-1
Great	-1
The Hosa cable I received broke after one use. I did not stress or abuse it. The electrical contact went open on the ground lug within the jack on one end of the cable. The wire broke just next to where it was soldered to the lug. I would not expect this to happen so early in use. The wire could possibly have been nicked there during fabrication and wire flexing then caused the open. After removal of the shrink-wrap, visual inspection of the solder joints, workmanship and materials showed them to be "budget" quality. You get for what you pay.	-1
Did not work. After I asked for a refund, Amazon told me I could just dispose of it. Threw it in the trash that moment! Don't waste your money on this thing.	-1
I didn't expect this cable to be so thin. It's easily 1/2 the thickness of any guitar cable I've used. Not sure about long-term durability or signal loss/interference. If I had the foresight I'd spend a couple extra bucks on a thicker cable.  Still, it works and was inexpensive.  EDIT: 6 months later and it's dead already.  Wire frayed at the right angle jack.  You get what you pay for.	-1
Awesome idea, broke within a week :(	-1
I had to turn the volume way way up when I use this to the point of loss of fidelity.	-1
hums too noisy......	-1
its a convience but this adapter provided a lot of static when I used it in my amp. Tried a different adapter and it worked fine. I'l; use this one as a backup.	-1
Does not work good Plugged it into a xlr mic and got nothing but really bad feedback noise. had to cut the new cord and use a guitar jack i already had that works fine. not worth returning for 7 bucks but i did pay 10 for overnight shipping.  throw it in the trash and forget about it. Blehhhhh	-1
Didn't work for me, wasn't what I thought it was used for. So I ordered the right adapter for my purposes.	-1
I got 3 of these to plug XLR cables into the 1/4" jacks on my board. I got it because my board only has 6 channels with XLR inputs. None of them work. Perhaps I got the wrong thing?	-1
Didn't work.	-1
I bought this adapter with a Shure headset for my DJ rig and this connector seems to cause poor volume/output levels. When I used a regular cable I bought from Monoprice, the quality was WAY better.  I'd recommend against this unless you have no other alternative.	-1
Does not send stereo signal through, only mono. Useless.	-1
Sent it back, it didn't suit my purposes.	-1
As with anything you should immediately test when received.  When I plugged this into a male jack then removed it I found that one of the two gender-benders I'd ordered had a female pin that would not stay in the connector shell.  Being an old electronics tech I noted that the locking tab was deformed - poor quality components.  Due to the low cost I decided to send it back using Amazon's automated system and I'm waiting for a replacement now.	-1
If you are running a low-fi sound system and have no plans to perform, then this is your answer.  However, if you have invested in a good, quality sound system and perform either live or in the studio this will be the weak link in your system.  As with most things in life, you get what you pay for and I was sadly mistaken when I thought a $14 switch would perform inline with my band's sound system.  When hooked up to an expensive Shure headset mic for our drummer run straight into the board this switch caused the mic to cut out and feed back.  Once we removed the switch (the weakest link), we had no issues.  If you need something reliable for a peformance I would recommend something like the Proco Power Mute.  Sure it's more expensive, but it's built like a tank, the performer can stomp on the footswitch and the light turns green (mic on) or red (mic off), and it's transparent as far as effecting your sound.  Also no worries about extending the mic or cable run with this long switch.	-1
This is an absolutely terrible wire! Do not purchase! I am a musician and needed a cable to connect an instrument to a PA (sound system) that was 1/8 to a 1/4 and this did not pick up the bass at all and the volume was very low with a poor signal. My friend connected it from his phone to the PA as well and it was as if it was going through a $2 speaker, very muffled, terrible sound quality. I don't understand these other reviews that were good!!! Please do not make this mistake!!!	-1
The worst XLR adaptor I have ever seen or used  -  won't stay locked in place . This makes the 5th and the last Hosa I will ever buy	-1
only two wire and power is shorted to ground not a good idea to use this	-1
Packaging has been damaged, cable was not quality, have not heard one side, did not have the proper sound, this is a very bad cable.	-1
Didn't work; I had to connect a female jack via female-to-male adapter to connect to my amp. Was product tested at factory before shipping?	-1
Pure crap. Two failed the first night. I threw them all away.	-1
Pretty noisy. Not great shielding around the center core, I guess. Other patch cables I have reduce noise significantly more than this cable.  There's no such thing as "tone" of a cable though, so if you think your lava cable or monster cables "sound" better, either brighter or warmer depending on who you are, then you're drinking the kool-aid. Inherent capacitance of a cable CAN affect tone, but if you're getting tone-sucking capacitance in a six-inch cable, then it's broken and you need to get a new one anyway.  The only reason I don't like these ones is because of poor shielding letting in electromagnetic interference, not because of an inferior guitar tone. </soapbox>	-1
These used to be the standard, but of the 3 packs I've bought this year only a handful still work. They come apart, leaving the tips inside my pedals' jacks. This requires disassembly of the pedal, sometimes replacement of the jack, to fix. I am not rough with my gear and my pedals sit in one spot. On some of them the tips will easily pull off by hand. I say go with the nicer Hosas with the all metal jacks if you know they'll fit your pedals, otherwise find another brand... these were once good and cheap, now they're just cheap.	-1
This unit worked once, then it was all static, all the time (except when turned off).  I tried different batteries and no luck.  Apparently defective.	-1
I tried it with Audacity on my desk to record my pod-casts and with my Kodak Zi8.  Both pretty weak.  I recorded someone talking with the zi8 as a test.  First with the sony mic and then without it.  First with mic sensitivity levels at normal and then again at max.  The Sony produced much more hiss and was nowhere near the sensitivity of the Zi8's internal mic.  The zi8's mic picked up so much more ambient noise and the voices were so much more robust.  Was really surprised to hear all the positive reviews with the Zi8.	-1
I tried this mic and it was terrible. The volume was very low, when you try to increase the volume you get a lot of white noise. Save your money, don't buy this product. I wish i could give it half of a star.	-1
BLA BLA BLA  All talk.  there is absolutely no bass. 50 years playing out and always working, I don't think this certain mic is worth anything. I'll give it extremely clear,, but that's all.  No bottom end no matter what you do to eq it. Even the Shure 58 is better, but no prize either. If you want a mic for a speaking application, then this is the mic for you, otherwise,  bla bla bla... All hipe!!!	-1
There are 4 mics to consider in the $100 price category: Sennheiser e835, Shure SM58, Audix OM-2, and AKG D5.  I've been doing sound for 10 years.  Each has its own faults.  Senn: lower midrange congestion -- like you have a cold, warm-sounding, rolled-off highs.  Very muddy sounding, but will add more "body" to your sound.  Shure: cold-sounding mic, highs better than Senns, some mid-range muddiness.  AKG: overall nice sounding mic.  Problem when you "push" the mic, i.e. sing loud.  Mic feels like it has a delay in it.  Audix: very nice sounding mic.  No major sonic problems.  Nice, extended highs.  It's the shadow of the awesome OM-5 ($250+) which is faster and has even better clarity.  My advice: go with the Audix OM-2, or spend $200+ for an Audix OM-5 or Senn 935.  Both high-end mics sound very similar.	-1
These are pretty good, if you can find one that isn't defective. This is the second one I've bought that arrived with a twisted cantilever. Doesn't anyone inspect these before they leave the factory?  The only upside is that Amazon allows returns/exchanges on styli and cartridges; a lot of other places do not. So be careful about where you buy them and find out what the return policy is.	-1
Poor quality, interference, noise, awful recording.	-1
These would not work in any city I visited, there was constant static.	-1
I've had this mic for almost two years.  In that time it has only left my home occasionally.  It always sits attached to my camera mount because I use it to make how-to videos at home.  It's never been abused in any way.  Today I went to use it and it was simply dead.  I tried a fresh battery and nothing.  It isn't a bad connection or a loose wire, it's just that some component on this thing's circuit card pooped out.  I have never in all my years of music and video production had a mic die this way.  Shame on Audio Technica for putting this piece of junk on the market.  BTW, I have another AT mic that I've had since 1981 and it still works.  My how times have changed.  It gets two stars simply because it sounded good when it did work.	-1
Amazing! When you open the box, you are greeted with WM-Pros not WLX-Pros. It's printed right on the modules!  Transmitter range is awful! Mic is tinny and cheap sounding. High pitched buzzing noise, regardless of channel 1 or 2! Mic level signal is too low, but since it's noisy, there's no point to increaing the gain.  I feel cheated and scammed. I truly hate this product!  $140! Yeah, it's not that much, but I expected better performance. This system is no better than the $35 Sima system, at least it did not have high pitched buzzing.  Garbage!	-1
Good for scratchy pots ... a disaster for faders. Totalled out the faders on my vintage Arp Odyssey and Tapco 4400. The faders no longer move. Both pieces were never toured and kept covered. The ARP was bought new. Dielectric grease by Luberex is the choice if you have to get into your vintage faders.	-1
Totally disappointed Was told it would lubracate my mixing board controls .. Not only did it ruin my controls but the can leaked like a bad roof ... Now it's going cost me 2 to 3 hundred dollars to have the controls replaced (((((((Customers Beware)))))))	-1
no comment	-1
Very Disappointed with this microphone. Admittedly I didn't expect much, but it's even worse - in fact it's not usable. Do NOT buy this microphone. I was looking for an omni-directional microphone and this seemed to be my only inexpensive option. I was hoping that Pyle would make an inexpensive omni, but I couldn't find one. I do like their directional mike the PDMIC58 which is very good. This microphone is going in the trash.	-1
My mistake I did not read the reviews.  I needed this for a play my daughter has a part in and the sound equipment we have needed a microphone.  We were on a budget and well I should have saved my money.  I can use this to hear things like a head phone if I want to hold it up to my ear and listen like a headset but cannot get the sound to come out on any sound system I have used and I have 4 different ones that I maxed the volume out on with no luck.  Very disappointed in this particular Sony product...	-1
This guitar initially was perfect for my granddaughter, even her professional instructor thought it was a nice instrument. Fast forward a couple of months, the neck has developed a convex bow making it completely unplayable. I've taken it to a guitar technician for inspection and he declared it is unrepairable due to the neck bow, and it is a manufacturer defect. Amazon is usually good about returning defective items for me, but in this case the response was "out of warranty" and I'm just left with a worthless guitar that I paid $145 for. Shame on Amazon, I've done a lot of business with them and this is not acceptable to me or anyone that works hard for their money. I'm disappointed and understandably frustrated, and my granddaughter can't continue with her lessons..	-1
I borrowed my friends guitar in order to get my nephew to play.  It is junk.  With new strings, it still sounds lousy.  The tuning machines are poor quality, one of the pegs keeps popping out, and the action is lousy (like any guitar comes out of the box unfortunately).  I have had several guitars.  While it is possible to buy a $130 guitar that is o-kaaay, you still need a luthier to set it up.  In my opinion you get what you pay for and there is a reason that Martins and Gibsons cost over $2000 for a decent instrument.  That aside, for kids starting out I would avoid this piece of junk and get something better, even an Epiphone maybe.	-1
I should have considered the adage, "You get what you pay for", but I was trying to save a few bucks and I figured Nady wouldn't put out an inferior product.  I was wrong.  I bought two of these and I had problems immediately with one of them.  I determined that the XLR connectors just weren't satisfactory.	-1
I bought this cable as a back-up to my long runs, but after a couple of gigs both connectors started to come apart. I've learned my lesson and will spend the extra money on better cables. Haven't bought Nady cables ever since.	-1
hums when connected to the system	-1
RETURNED ALSO WITH KEY BOARD	-1
OK I GUESS  FOR THE PRICE	-1
cheep  not buy this mic	-1
This is an alright mic for the price, it "feels durable" and does it job........ but it won't last long. Mine worked for a few months as i was starting my mobile DJ business, needless to say plugging it in over and over messed up the bottom of the 3 prong connector on the mic. NOW i am not saying that this will happen with all the MICs, but i am sure something will go wrong with this unit. You get what you pay for... less than 20 bucks for a professional microphone ..... ill just leave it at that  -Good mic for a beginner for the price - DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL AND YOU ARE GOING TO USE THIS DAILY OR WEEKLY	-1
This thing worked the first time I plugged it in, but it hadn't worked since! It seems to be well constructed...don't be fooled!	-1
The short version of this review: If you're a beginner I would not recommend this product. If you're an intermediate player approach with caution. If you're looking for a solid tool for home recording consider buying a nicer virtual instrument plug-in for your DAW or perhaps even a real Pocket POD before this thing. I am very disappointed in this product considering the other options.  GuitarPort is marketed as being both a educational tool as well as professional recording tool, I will review both aspects separately. To use GuitarPort as an educational tool requires a monthly subscription fee to GuitarPort OnLine. The monthly fee is less than ten dollars and for that you get a fixed library of professionally recorded hit tracks from the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, etc... For a given track you can download: without bass, without guitar or full mix. You can also download the guitar tab and tone settings. The tone settings will load the appropriate amp model, effects and then set up the amp and effects. You can hit the play and stop buttons and the tab will display on the screen. Sounds great right? Well, it is to a point.... The nice thing here is that you are downloading official tone settings and official tabs licensed by the publisher. The bad thing is that the tab playback software is pretty bad. It's just displaying a PDF on screen and scrolling as the track plays. If you've ever used a program like GuitarPro you will be very very disappointed in the TAB playback. Also the number of songs available is a problem. They aren't really updating their catalog. Lessons are OK at best (if the TAB playback where more like GuitarPro for features then the lessons would be much better, but it isn't). You might as well walk into a local music store and buy a book on playing, the lesson selections here (while some are very good) are not organized in a coherent way for a beginner. The product assumes the player knows what an effect box is, what the various settings on an amp does, etc... in short, it's not a beginners tool. Overall I would give this a grade C- as a learning tool. It has potential for intermediate players, but that's about it. There is another big problem with Guitar Port as an educational tool: NO BASS TABS are available through guitar port on-line and if you want the bass amp models and effects you will have to buy them on-line as an software upgrade for about fifty dollars! As a tool for bass guitarist, GuitarPort is useless.  Regarding using GuitarPort for professional recording tool: When it comes to using software to simulate amps, rhythms, etc.. there are a few industry standards that make these sort of products compatible with a wide variety of DAW (digital audio workstation) recording software such as ProTools, Cakewalk, Ableton Live, etc..  the most popular standard is called VST. Line6 recently added GearBox VST as part of GuitarPort software package, so if you're looking to add Line6 POD quality models and effects for direct guitar studio recording, this is an inexpensive solution and really the only area in which Guitar Port shines (p.s. I still perfer the tone quality and features of Amplitube 2 for this sort of thing)  Overall the GuitarPort a bit of a novelty product, it's not the amp models or effects are bad, it's just for about fifty dollars more you can pick up a PocketPOD and have all these great tones in a little battery powered, hand held device. You even hook the PocketPOD up to a PC using a USB cable and download the free software from Line6 to do almost everything you can with GuitarPort. I see a lot of positive reviews for this thing, so it seems it has made many people happy, but your money can be spent better elsewhere and if you are a beginner stay far away!  Only two stars for lack of coherence for the education/training this thing provides. GuitarPort on-line offers too little for what you get and absolutely zero bass guitar material in terms of tabs and lessons. Bass amp models (and a good number of PODxt models) require add on purchase here. You could easily spend $150 on add-ons before making the GuitarPort a viable studio VST instrument. Overall a decent product ideally that has been very very poorly executed.	-1
1st of it was a fake! It had a poor functioning switch and no shock mounted mic cartridge 2 part handle by the mike cord end and no stamp inside where the cable inserts, also underside of mic condenser the circuit board in recessed and does not have the red quality control stamp. Long story short it sound no different then a 29$ mic very pitchy on mid and highs, Not even close to my original sm58s ! oh ya when the box says made in china Gotcha.  If your going to spend 99$ or 105$ just go to a seller that buys direct from a Shure dealer! Don't pay 99 or 105$ for a nock off.	-1
Unfortunatey started trying to use it after the return period thinking it would be fine...and discovered that something is very wrong with the mic that I received...  It is way too muddy...and worse than my cheap AudioTechnica Pro 4L...  What gives???  Did I get a knock-off that I was assured of not getting???	-1
This is not original product. I'm not satisfied.  Too late to return :(	-1
I returned this mic due to it's poor audio quality.  I did not feel that the audio frequency response met my modest expectations.  The sound produced was very "tinny".	-1
You're buying a brand, not a quality microphone. This isn't the Shure of the olden days. This is poorly manufacturer, dull sounding, and un-durable junk. Go with Seinheiser or EV, save yourself the headache. Sad but true, Shure isn't what it used to be. This is junk.	-1
Both the Shure SM57 and SM58 microphones (which, by the way, are the same on the inside) are considered industry workhorses. You see these things pop up everywhere, from studios to live gigs to concerts on TV. They are everywhere. Which I find a bit strange because, frankly, they aren't that good.  The design of these mics goes back about 40 years. But a lot has happened with microphone technology during that time. These models may have been very good decades ago, but they are really showing their age. The most prominent problem with them is the sound quality... they are quite "honky," making vocalists sound much more nasal than they really are. There are some situations where that might be okay (such as miking a guitar cabinet that lacks upper mid-range), but these models do not make good vocal mics.  In a shootout in my studio with more than 20 different models of mics, the SM57/58 were near the bottom of the list. Virtually every other microphone we tested sounded better. And I'm not talking about comparing it to $3500 Neumann U87 mics either... more than half of the mics we used were under $150. Other, better choices in a similar price range are the AKG D5, Heil Sound PR 22, or stepping up to the Shure Beta 57, which is much, much better. And all of which have better off-axis rejection and higher gain before feedback.  I know that nearly everyone uses these mics, but that doesn't actually mean they are that good. There are much better choices for your money.  On the plus side, both the SM57 and SM58 are nearly bullet-proof. You can really abuse them and they'll sound just like they did when they were brand-new.	-1
I ordered this the same day I ordered a guitar from Guitar Center, If you see "Email for availability" on a web page you are ordering from that means its back ordered. After 20 days of waiting they sent an email stating it was going to be another 30 days. I shopped real stores and bought a beautiful Stratocaster.  BUT by that time my 30 day warranty was up and the M-Audio bearly functions. The head phone jack has to be pulled out in just this special place to work; the USB connection  crackles and cuts out completely sometimes.  My musician friends are back in town and say Line 6 is better.  No matter I'm very happy to be playing again.  The delay gave me time to realize I needed good instrument that is a joy to play and I got this sweet Fender instead of the 150 buck bargain. Oh! the M-Audio was a refurbish...NO bargain	-1
Old technology but not old enough to be interesting.	-1
K&M 15201B Trumpet Stand  I used these stands for years, until one of my trumpets was knocked over with only a slight brush by my knee. The trumpet fell on a hard floor and damaged the 2nd valve slide assembly; after hundreds in repair bills, it never worked well again.  The problem is that this stand has a fatal design flaw, in that it tips over far too easily with your instrument on it.  Thousands of these tip-prone stands were sold (and are still in use) before K&M invented the much-more-stable , FIVE legged stand.  Search Amazon on:  K M trumpet stand  K & M should discontinue this three-leg model.	-1
Sound quality: 3 out of 5. Half decent, but not worth $29 in my opinion (even though I bought it for $12, which is about the right price for these).  The bass output is noticeably less than my JVC HA-S700 and sounds muffled compared to those.  Comfort: 2 out of 5. I have a small head (adult small/x-small) and these feel too tight, after about 20 minutes using I have to take them off to relieve the pressure.  Even with them being tight, I plugged them into my amp and began to jam on my guitar and any movement more than a simple head nod made the headband flip on top of my face.  The only thing I like about these are that it has the cord coming from one side vice both.  Durability: 1 out of 5. After two weeks of owning, I plugged them into my computer and listened to a little bit of music and all was normal.  I switched songs and noticed the right ear piece was not playing. I switched back to the song I was listening to before and still wasn't playing.  I do not recommended the HF125	-1
honestly i would rather use toys (skullcandy) than these... they are comfortable though.. I was expecting a nice loud yet crisp sound	-1
I do not recommend this one to anyone... I loved it when I first got it, but after about 2 months of ownership, I started getting a constant hiss sound out of it. I was using it for home recording, and every track I record with it has that hiss in the background. Nothing happened to it that could have caused it to get damaged, so I have to assume it's just poor quality.	-1
Both the Shure SM57 and SM58 microphones (which, by the way, are the same internally) are considered industry workhorses.  You see these things pop up everywhere, from studios to live gigs to concerts on TV.  They are everywhere.  Which I find a bit strange because, frankly, they don't sound good.  The design of these mics goes back about 40 years.  A lot has happened with microphone technology during that time.  These models may have been very good decades ago, but they are really showing their age.  The most prominent problem with them is the sound quality... they are quite "honky" making everyone sound far more nasal than they do in real life.  There are some situations where that might be okay, but unless you are a vocalist who actually wants to sound more nasal than you do in reality, there are much better choices out there, as these two mics will really emphasize any honkiness/nasality of your voice.  In a shootout in my studio with more than 20 different models of mics, the SM57/58 were clearly near the bottom of the list.  Virtually every other microphone we tested sounded better.  And I'm not talking about comparing it to $3500 Neumann U87 mics either... half of the mics we used can be had for under $150.  Another, much better choice in a similar price range is the AKG D5, or you can step up to the Shure Beta 58, which is much, much better, and a microphone I can easily recommend.  Both of these other mics also have better off-axis rejection and higher gain before feedback.  I know that nearly everyone uses these mics, but that doesn't actually mean they are that good.  There are much better choices for your money.  "Tradition" alone isn't a great reason to buy a particular product, especially in a technology-heavy field.  On the plus side, both the SM57 and SM58 are nearly bullet-proof.  You can really abuse them and they'll sound just like they did when they were brand-new.  Aside from the extreme durability (which is now nearly standard in similarly-priced models), the only other reason to consider an SM58 instead of another option is if you want to be the lazy sound guy that doesn't want to even try to create a proper mix and prefers to rely on the odd mid-range peak of this mic to make a vocal cut through a mix of instruments.  Please take note, though, that doesn't mean that it is going to sound great... just that you'll have that odd and annoying honky peak standing out in the mix over everything else.  If you like being the sound engineer that doesn't want to mess with proper mic selection and bother with equalization to create a good mix, maybe the SM57/SM58 actually are the mics for you.  (Inevitably when I attend an event with a terrible mix I'll see SM58s all over the stage.)  As for me and anyone else that makes sound quality and great mixes a priority, we'll probably select something else.	-1
This lasted a few weeks and shorted out.	-1
I really did not expect a super high quality cable but I did expect it to last for a few months at least.  I used it twice (regular plug it in and sing kind of use, I am not swinging from it or using it as a lasso...) and now it works intermittently at best.  I bought a more expensive cable at a local music store to ensure the issue was indeed this cable and not my mic or amp.  Save your $$ and buy something else.	-1
These things are terrible. One wouldn't fit in my soundboard, another wouldn't lock in my mic. Plain and simple....if your looking for crap that doesn't work....buy this.	-1
Looks like metal but feels like plastic alot of static first cables i ever bought for my home studio last cheap product i will buy	-1
Received it in time, standard blister packaging but the cable stopped working after 45 days. Since I was out of 30 days return time, sent an email to the manufacturer but no response till today.	-1
Deal or not, if you are serious... you do not buy a guitar in this price range.  And I do not mean serious in terms of wanting to really be a pro guitarist... I just mean, if you are serious in trying to learn guitar... do not.  These things are always overly cheap and unplayable.  I have a few cheap models of Silvertone guitars that are for display purposes only (signed by artists) and, trust me, as a guitarist who owns many guitars, I cant even play these things. They are so cheap, the strings do not stay in tune, usually have intonation problems (cant clear frets and thus buzz and pop or never have proper note frequences at all the frets).  They usually always feel cheap too and the feel does affect the playability and tone.  If you want to really learn you have to pay at least a little more and go for better brands.  I would recommend anyone serious in learning to never buy a guitar that costs under $300... you are just wasting your money and the problems and limitations may even frustrate you and work against you learning how to play.  Go for the brands that are made by the bigger dogs... like ESP's LTD brand... Gibson's Epiphone brand, or Fender's lower brand (Squire?).  There are other examples.  I am sure Ibanez has some good lower models (though I am not sure they have a lower brand name for their cheaper gear).  If you do have to go for a cheaper brand, at least then buy their top of the line models (this pertains to Dean, for example).  But for me, brands like Silvertone and Archer... are just plain no good for real use.	-1
I bought one of these guitars by itself - not the package - played it maybe twice, and sold it the next day. It felt like it was made from a cut of really cheap pine or other cheap wood. The neck joint is very flimsy and the guitar easily gets out of tune because of this flimsy cheap joint. The pickup selector switch would cause bursts of static when switching while playing - cheap pickups and very little tone control - even though this is meant to resemble a Fender Strat - that's the extent of any comparison. This package would be okay for a beginner - better than the cheapo package guitars you see in the big box discount stores, but not a very good guitar. In the same price range - or for a few bucks more Epiphone and Ibanez might be a better choice.	-1
Junk, right out of the box.  The neck was warped, among other things.  Spend a few extra dollars and but a reputable brand.	-1
Not satisfied the product did not work. The sound keeps cracking.	-1
These earphones would be good for casual listening, not as a pair headphones to really get the rich sound while in a environment filled with other sounds/music going on.  They do not fit snug, the wire is a straight cord which interferes with movement in/around the mixer and the have a tendency to "slide" around and off  my head.  Ihad to turn the earphone jack up to the max in order to get an audioable level.  I gave them to my son for his personal music.  Would not purchase item.	-1
People, I don't understand  you. I run a studio, I do record vocals, I mix, I don't do masters. The quality of sound coming out of this headset, is simply horribe. Are you kidding me? Sounds like an empty can. I got them from Guitar Center based on recommendation. I've took them back within 2 days. I couldn't  believe  anyone  would write a good review for this. Your standards  must be super low. If anyone cares I still believe the best you can use in studio would be either SONY MDRV6, or SONY MDR2509HD. the rest are just toys.	-1
The headphones buzzed like loose paper was inside when used with my bass amp at a moderate volume.	-1
mine broke after 1 week - lost the center part of the stereo image.  Will be returning.  Sounded great until then tho!	-1
The sound is not as nice as my friends older original k240's. In fact I am not happy at all with these. The highs are slightly reed like and the lows are just not there. Well they are there but lacking the tone and depth of my other headphones. I'll break them in a little and see if that helps.	-1
I used these headphones in my small guitar studio for a very short time. Headphones are a useful tool for guitarists when trying to learn solos by ear. These headphones are useless for this particular application. They are mushy with little definition and they clip easily,  even when pulling out the lower frequencies and operating at a reasonable volume. I ended up giving them to my 18 year old daughter hoping that she would have better luck than I. Eventually I ended up going with the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x and I couldn't be happier.	-1
Very disappointed with bass. I'm no "basshead". I love all kinds of music from popular to acoustic to classical.  The bass in the AKG K240 drops off severely below 50 Hz and is nearly inaudible at 30 Hz even though the product description claims 15 Hz.  Any attempt to boost the bass will result in fluttering sounds of driver excursion. I personally prefer to leave my music source flat and I don't like using bass boost, but I want to hear natural sounding clear and sufficiently loud bass.  Here's a spectral plot analysis of the acoustic music video "It's Time" from "Imagine Dragons". http://bit.ly/1nbufm8  Even though it's acoustic music (they don't even use true bass instruments), there's a lot of music between 30 and 70 Hz.  So contrary to the opinions of music elitists who frown at "bassheads" and the bass heavy products, we really do need good bass reproduction for all sorts of music.  What the elitists who give this product a high rating call "flat" or "neutral" is misleading.  Flat should mean the frequency response is flat throughout the music frequency spectrum.  All that said, I will say that I like the build quality and the detachable cable.	-1
Wanted a good pair of studio MIXING headphones. These are NOT. They sound and feel like the cheap headphones I got at Ross on a whim for 12 bucks. When they say these are flat, they mean that NO FREQUENCY is very well represented. I am still looking for a good pair of mixing headphones, and have decided to go to a music store and try a bunch first.  NOTE: the Sony MDR 7506 are not the answer: they have NO BASS, very tinny, and the ear pads will rot within months whether you use them or not.  Again, they have NO BASS so you'll end up putting too much bass in your mix. Also, the leakage is bad, so you can't use them to track. Kind of useless headphones.  I realize you are not supposed to mix entirely on headphones, but I'd like some that are flat and decent. Still looking.  --Tatyaya	-1
More of a design thing but not for vocal recording you can clearly hear the sound coming out of these right in your mic.	-1
I've owned and used AKG K240s (and the discontinued K240DF) for more than a decade.  The quality of the product has fallen CONSIDERABLY since manufacturing moved to China.  To be truthful, this was never a particularly durable headset, but the old models made in Europe were head and shoulders above what AKG is shipping now.  They feel flimsy coming out of the box, and the product I received has a poor solder connection internally that makes the right channel audio cut out when you turn your head.  The plastic ear cup is already partially cracked and I've used them for just two months in studio.  The ear padding isn't as soft or comfortable as the old model, either.  Sonically, they are everything I'd like my headphones to be, but that doesn't matter when I can only hear in one ear. I won't be buying AKG headphones again in the near future.	-1
It fit okay and was comfortable but, although it might be fine for a speaker, the tone was not adequate for singing.  I much prefer my SM58.	-1
This strobe is AWESOME while it works. It is extremely bright the and great to have as a DJ.  I have come into ownership of three of the lights brandnew.  One I bought off amazon, the other two were given.  After just 3 dances, only one light works now.  The problems. Light #1 doesn't do ANYTHING.  Not a single flash...  (and YES, I did try changing the bulbs out)  Light #2 strobes at random, and does not work in manual mode. However, it does work when plugged into a strobe controller.  Light #3 still works.  I have always liked chauvet gear, but after this experience I WOULD NOT buy this product again.  I would go with a more expensive alternative that is built to last more than three gigs.	-1
I received two of these speaker, but one didn't work. Unfortunately, it's been quite a pain for me to have the item returned due to the return policy for this item reason why I'm just rating it one star.	-1
The locking mechanism failed and the guitar fell. Lifetime warranty my booty. They said that since I left my guitar on there overnight and for awhile then it's not covered. It's only meant to be used temporarily like on stage. C'mon now. I guess the locking mechanism is a failure point and that is their canned line. Anyways look at the angles of the legs, that's pretty poor engineering if you understand stability. Alas, it was the only one at the time that would fit my V. When it worked it was good, but not worth having your guitar take a dump.	-1
I do not recommend this product. This guitar stand was great. It almost fit in my gig bags and was fun to open. I wasn't very delicate with it- I would hold the small back leg and flick the unit so that the other two legs would flip out. It's much easier to show. Yes, I could have treated the unit better, but I'd bet that a lot of folks open it the way I did.  IN ANY CASE, it no longer works now. There wasn't a moment when i felt like i broke it, i just tried to use it one day and it failed. The lock on the legs has failed and it will no longer do it's job to hold my guitar up. Therefore, I still will be buying a stand that can stand the test of time (and my ownership). I've owned some Hercules gear for a couple years now. It's more expensive for sure, but they're products haven't broke on me yet.	-1
The under-guitar support arms stick out too far for a solid-body instrument. The cord tends to get tangled on them.	-1
This guitar stand was one of the better options compared to the cheapy stands you can buy. I don't gig with my stand, it simply sits in my practice space and holds my guitar. After owning the stand for about a year out of nowhere one of the front legs gave out and my G&L hit the floor. After inspection the plastic locking mechanism simply broke just from the constant weight of the guitar hanging on it. I contacted Ultimate and they sent me out a replacement locking mechanism and I drilled out the rivet and replaced. Worked fine for 4 months and the exact same thing happened but this time I was simply hanging the guitar and the leg gave out so my Legacy didn't hit the floor. Called Ultimate again and they are now sending me a complete new stand. Still not satisfied with the safety of my guitar on this stand old or new I again took apart the old stand and cut a piece of metal pipe ( top rail pipe of chain link fence fit perfect ) that fits super tight in the bottom hole for the locking mechanism and simply made it to where the stand will no longer collapse for transport. I really like the stand but I will no longer trust Ultimate with the safety of my instruments with the way it is manufactured.	-1
I don't know if this is a new thing with all Gator racks, or just the 2U, but for some reason they've made two changes with kind of suck  1) They've swapped which portion of the rack has the hooks, and which portion has the clasps. The clasps are now on the rack, not the lids. This is reverse of my 4 space gator rack and often leads to some fumbling around since I'm used to holding the clasps as I remove the lid. Same with putting the lids on - it makes much more sense to hold the lid by the clasps and put it on the rack  2) The new handle sucks. Big time. It's not the nice bar of extruded aluminium, it's a cheesy nylon strap now with a thin strip of metal at each end where it slides in/out of the case. I keep a really heavy Fryette 2/90/2 tube guitar power amp in this rack and I'm not confident this handle is up to the task for the long haul.	-1
After only 3 months of use, one of the stands no longer supports my JBL SXR speaker. It just slides down to the lowest, unextended position within a matter of 20-30 seconds. Will be seeking warranty service but will sell immediately afterwards. I had my old On-Stage stands for 5 years, and although they weren't as nice looking or as promising as these Ultimates, they were always functional. Will buy another pair of On-Stage stands (and for much less too). Also, the Ultimate bag that holds a pair of these stands didn't fare so well in the 3 months either. Already holes and small nicks throughout. Disappointed.	-1
Ultimate disappointment.  I've had these stands for years.  Their durability is the best feature about them.  In fact the telelock mechanism is a great innovation too . . .  Here's the "BUT":  I have to give them a poor rating on a few accounts.  First & foremost is that these stands rattle, and not softly.  I have 4 of them, and they all rattle.  The frequency range in which they rattle is roughly 69-98Hz.  The sound clearly comes from the telelock mechanism.  Since all 4 of the ones I have do this it can't be coincidence, but instead poor design.  One of my stands has lost its "grip" to keep the pole slipping downward while the telelock is on the raise setting as well, but that's just 1 out of 4 (you may be wondering why I have 4 - I work as a professional DJ, and it's important to always have backups.  Therefore you always buy more than what you need.)  Here's the other huge problem with these stands - Ultimate Support's support.  Currently I have a very nice rep working on the case for me who seems to be a little more proactive.  However, I called Ultimate Support over a year ago about the issue with the vibration in these stands.  I even sent an audio file to them where they could place a speaker on a stand, play the audio, and hear it for themselves.  I've had to call way too many times to attempt to get this issue resolved.  This is seriously unprofessional to drop the ball this badly.  Not only that, but I have another Ultimate Support product that was faulty from the start - a Jam Stand mic stand.  When I called more recently about my ts-90b's I also brought up that the Jam Stand was defective.  The rep assured me that they would just send me a new one since it wasn't worth it for me to send in the old one (admittedly it's an inexpensive mic stand).  It's been almost 2 months since the initial call was made where the jam stand was reported as defective, and I was assured I'd receive a replacement.  I have not even received a notice that a new stand was shipped.  Seriously though, no follow up for over a year, and no resolution is simply unacceptable.  As stated earlier I have a rep who seems to be more proactive and diligent.  I'm hoping she will resolve this situation to satisfaction.  I will update my review after the outcome.  Until that time though, I would strongly recommend not purchasing anything from Ultimate Support.	-1
This case might be okay if you are just transporting things from the trunk of your car to a gig, but this case is not worth considering if you plan to fly with it. First of all, the latches are both flimsy and exposed to shearing on both sides. This case has been through about 4 round trips, and already one of the latches is bent and coming apart. The latches can easily open during travel, so tie wraps are a must in order to secure them into place.  The case itself is okay, fairly light duty and the power strip is of nice quality.  This is not a professional product.	-1
I've been gigging for about 15 years now and this seems like the industry standard at clubs and bars when the sound man comes to start helping you setup everything.  Most of them are beat to hell but they work.  That's about the best thing I can say about the Beta 58.  It can take a beating and probably not fail.  The sound quality will suffer as several beat up Beta 58's I've used sounded like there was a rag wrapped around the mic but it got the job done in a pinch.  As I started working with other vocalists who brought their own mics to shows, I noticed that none of them really used the beta 58.  Most of them preferred either the EV ND767a, the Sennheiser e935a or the Sure Beta 87a.  The differences between these mics and the "house 58's" was astonishing... even 58's in very good condition (never been dropped or abused) did not sound as clear as the EV/SENN's.  The biggest difference though is the feedback from stage monitors.  The Senn and EV both have much better feedback rejection than any of the 58's I've seen.  All in all, I've been pretty underwhelmed with the 58.  For around the same price there are much better choices.  I know that different venues, singers, PA setups, different stage monitors, etc all can affect how a mic performs but my observations are based on hearing pretty much the same traits over and over so they are not based on isolated incidents and I also base this all on the performance of new or like new 58's, not the beat up ones.	-1
Good enough for a 'house party' as someone mentioned before me. In other words, it 'kinda' works but not really. The light beam isn't narrow/clean enough to do a good job on a mirror ball and the lamp mount is a bit on the flimsy side - it bends very easily. The lamp housing itself is solid though. Careful when taking off the mount as you're going to have a hard time getting the two wheel screws back into the housing.....! Would not buy again.	-1
Well that was a waste of money.  Just buy coated sticks as these are about useless and nearly impossible to get on correctly.	-1
I have been a long-time user of Stick Rapp, in the solid black color. Ever since a drummer left a pair of sticks behind at one of my gigs with these wraps, I have been in love. BUT, it seems all varieties aside from the solid black are distinctly lacking in the stickiness that makes the black ones so appealing. That goes for these as well. If you're looking for a wrap to make your grip more sure, even when sweating significantly, "stick" to the all-black and avoid these!	-1
The tremolo effect can barely be heard! I tested this in every spot of the pedalboard, and even with the depth all the way up it's barely noticeable. If you want a great Tremolo for the same price, get the Donner Golden Tremolo. It's sturdier, smaller, and actually can be heard.	-1
I bought these for my wonderful Yamaha FG700s. I play every day and was hoping to give some rest to my fingers and try the softer tone of nylon strings. I was happy to have found nylon strings that, according to the description, could be used in acoustic guitars for steel strings (hey! they even come with ball ends!). I was hopeful that these "high tension" would work well but either way decided to be EXTREMELY careful when tuning the strings.  I was almost successful, until the E string snapped (of course had to be that one!). Complete frustration and complete waste of money! Back to my reliable steel strings. Please do not waste your money and time.	-1
I like the V12 reeds better.	-1
I love V-12 reeds, and use them exclusively now.  I tried the 56 Rue Lepic, but can honestly say I hate them.  They are very stiff, a different "resistance sizing" than the V-12s so far as I can tell, and that seems a bit crazy.  I recently took up clarinet playing after a very, very long absence.  My degree is in clarinet performance/music education.  I decided to give Vandoren another try (never used to like them) and have found my favorite reeds are the V-12s.  I have tried several of my "old brands" and just like the V-12s for their sound....it has a lot of clarity, and with the right mouthpiece, the sound is not "too bright." And by the way, I am finding 6-8 out of each box of 10 are really good reeds, some of them are great.  I am just transitioning from 2.5s to 3s, so I tried the 56 Rue 2.5s....no way....they are very stiff and I am going to have to spend a lot of time to see if I can make them playable.  If my opinion changes in the future, I will update this review.	-1
I got this a few weeks ago.  I messed around with it long enough to know I don't have a regular need for it.  It sounded cool in an experimental kind of way, and I may find a use for it some day, but seemed to create noise at the lower frequency notes (...and that could just be my amp) and produced a lot of sounds (at various settings) that I thought were terrible.  As for the effect itself, I just found it hard to use it in a predictable way.  It was fun to play around with but every time I've tried to work with it, I find myself shutting it off to get to the sound I am going for.  I knew it would sound electronic, that's it's key trait, but just found it making things sound muddy, especially with the fuzz setting.  I don't like it's distortion feature at all.  I will continue to play around and figure out if I have a use for it but it will take a lot of effort on my part.  Not the kind of pedal that "out-of-the-box" blows you away, but not a terrible thing to have either if you have a niche use for this kind of sound.	-1
While the pedal is flexible and has a few modes, I just couldn't handle the digital artifacts and synthetic sound. If you want a simple clean 1 octave down reproduction of your signal, this is NOT your pedal.	-1
Have been playing guitar for many years now and from that experience can't say I was all that impressed with this set of strings. Did not maintain intonation as expected and definitely a weak string. Don't expect several of them to hold up for very long... and I change strings fairly regular due to the amount of playing I do.... but, these didn't withstand the usual period. Mostly disappointed with intonation. Prefer D'Addario hands down. With D'Addario I get great intonation and much better longevity, even beyond my typical switch outs.	-1
Bad action, fret buzz, cheap hardware,  faulty toggle switch, crap plastic nut not cut properly, loose strap holders, loose cheap tuners, shall I go on?	-1
Went to local place to check out hands-on.  I was not impressed at all.  The thing just felt cheap.  I could not imagine playing it for long.  It was not fun to hold and parts looked cheesy.  Other than body shape, it was nearly identical to the Epiphone SG-Special Electric Guitar sold at the same price.  I am surprised the Les Paul name was allowed to be used on this.	-1
This Epi Les Paul Special ll was supposed to be upgraded w/ better pick ups and circuitry but a guitar tech found the frets on the neck where it's bolted to the body were uneven heights.  Cost for the fret dressing would have exceeded the price of the guitar.  While Epiphone is definitely an alternative to high end guitars, its Chinese guitars in this price range need better quality control.	-1

The 2 Stars is for the price for a single pick holder, other offers have 5 Alice or no-name brand in a package starting at $2.82	-1
i tried this and did not noticed much improvement in any of my guitar sound.	-1
it's good but think its a bit expensive for just one they should give you two for that price or lower the price	-1

Usually I don't break strings but have broken a string at 2 consecutive gigs. Going back to my other strings.	-1
Their quality control must be slipping.  The unwound stings (e, b, g) each have 3 or 4 tiny black deposits that feel like raised, scratchy bumps or grains of sand on the strings.  They do not scrape off easily, either.  I have never seen this on guitar strings before.  If you are sliding your fingers up or down the strings, you definitely feel them.  They are an unnecessary distraction from the playing experience as well as uncomfortable.	-1
Had a good sound and seemed to be well made until mine stopped working after about a month of minimal use (I never even got to use it live). Ended up with a Vox Wah thats been working like the day a bought it four years ago. This isn' the first Dunlop product I've had that stopped working on me, and I have since lost faith in the company and have not bought anything from them in about 6 years (Although I hear they own MXR now). I suggest you keep your reciept/get a warranty.	-1
Strings are over rated. Had to immediately replace them. For some reason they did not work well on my Fender guitar	-1
This pedal is not that great. The wah sweep is too wide, it's like an on/off switch, you struggle to find those great frequencies right in the middle where the thing feeds back though the amp in just the right way. The vox with the silver top has the right sweep.... Vocal, tight, none of the super harsh higher frequencies of the crybaby.  I don't know if they've improved the model since I purchased mine a few years ago. But knowing what I know now, I'd never buy one again, I'd go straight for the vox.	-1
I have an Applause MAE148-4 mandolin and to my disappointment this capo doesn't provide a very good press on the strings resulting in annoying muting and buzzing. I will probably just go back to using a regular guitar capo	-1
I still get quite a bit of pop. Not impressed.	-1
I played in a band with a guy who used this as his main guitar for YEARS. He would spend up to 10 minutes of a 40 minute set tuning. He put a new bridge and locking tuners on it, and bought a boss pedal tuner. It still could not be properly intonated after hours of adjustment. He had a deep emotional attatchment to it because of the person who gave it to him, and we couldn't really ask him to get rid of it. We once spent 3 hours in a studio attempting to tune and adjust this guitar. He ended up using my guitar for the rest of the session. It was a happy day for us when it was stolen. Before you buy this guitar please consider the possibility that it might have improperly dried neck wood, a badly cut neck pocket and a poorly cut nut.	-1
Its okay.	-1
The filter is a good filter, with double neoprene, the arm that it attaches to is crap.  It won't stay where you put it, it is weak, and ultimately I threw the whole thing away after fighting with it for almost an hour.  If you have an extra arm or have it dangle straight down it might work.  Perhaps Mine is defective.  And that is a definite possibility.	-1
This pedal doesn't boost the sound, My guitar sounds louder when I'm playing on the clean channel, rather than with this pedal with full volume and distortion. Also I notice not that much difference between a good Overdrive from a Marshall Amp compared to this distortion in a general sense, but greater sound of the Marshall Overdrive.	-1
Very flimsy - the goose neck cannot support the weight of the filter if the clamp is located any distance from the microphone.	-1
Good idea, but for what I needed, not quite, but it was a little inflexible at the end of the extension bar, would get lose, could be improved.	-1
The D string I received had a kink in it, rendering it unusable.  Had to buy another set.  Probably won't buy again.	-1
I normally buy Gibson mandolin strings, but I decided to give ghs a try. They are made in America and had good reviews. They play good and sound clear and warm, however one of the A strings slowly unwound and popped as I was putting it on! Very disappointed that I had to put one of my old A strings back on to get through a performance the next day. I will not be buying these again.	-1
The snake on this pop filter is not very sturdy, it will fall down and bend when I try to position the filter over my mic.	-1
Pretty thin and jangly. I threw it out	-1
Not very good.	-1
too cumbersome for me	-1
Seems like a simple concept, hold up two layers of nylon between you and the mic, how hard could that be? Get used to being half way thru recording just to have to stop because the arm slips and falls away from the mic.	-1
As others here have said, this thing is way too big.  I got a medium, and have small hands, and I'm not sending this back for a small, because frankly, I'm done.  Go in a store and try them on is my advice.  I have others that fit fine.  I wanted the whole Coricidin bottle thing but this isn't worth it, and for me at least is unusable.	-1
bad material	-1
Vater sticks are computer matched by pitch and weight AT the factory. For some reason, somebody between Vater and the UPS person who received the shipment (I'm looking at you, AMAZON) decided to un-pair the sticks from their Vater sleeves, then repackage them in a long, plastic sleeve with the Vater sleeve folded up next to the sticks in the baggie. I could tell when I opened the box that it wasn't going to be right, and as soon as I held them in my hands, I knew they were different weights. Visual inspection showed one stick obviously longer than the other, and if you look at the photo of the butt-end of the sticks along the ruler, you can see that the cuts are at different points of the curvature. There was a difference of 6 grams between the sticks. I've uploaded photos of the initial shipment.  In all fairness, this is the first time I've ever had this problem ordering sticks through Amazon. I've got 7 other pairs that were just fine before this - two of which were Vater sticks (Power 5B Sugar Maple Wood & Xtreme Design XD-5B Wood).  As far as Vater sticks when they aren't tampered with from the factory - great products. I've got the Power 5B Sugar Maple Wood Tip sticks already, and the size is great, I just need something a little sturdier when I'm on an acoustic set. These would have been perfect had they been a properly matched set.  I'm giving this product one star based on a hair-brained decision to un-pair and repackage the sticks somewhere along Amazon's distribution line.	-1
the gooseneck became loose above the lower mounting and i can't tighten it up... kind of disappointing !	-1
Poor quality. The capo is to tight and causes strings to sound sharp.  The metal spring broke after three months.  Do not buy.	-1
the thing is that they don't seem to stay! i mean, you can change the position of the pop filter by varying the shape of the metallic "arm", but it doesn't stay where you put it. and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality. but, i think if you're lucky if just might get the job done.	-1
This guitar had the worst tuning pegs I have ever seen. Guitar would not stay in tune even for 1 song. I tried a heavier gauge string but they were no better. Might be a decent instrument if you put on a set of tuning pegs but I didn't want to bother. Returned it.	-1
This capo is not acceptable for acoustic guitars with low tension, as the clamping force is so tight that it bends the strings up. I would recommend getting an easily adjustable capo instead for much more versatility for the same price. I have seen the videos about adjusting this capo, and I am a 200 pound male who lifts weights daily and it hurt my hand and took a very long time to pull the capo looser. Even then, the tension was not equal across all strings. I would much rather turn a knob than gorilla force this into a suitable position.	-1
Pops off all of the time, way too big.	-1
These strings have very little resonance. Couldn't wait to change them. I won't be ordering them again.	-1
Save your money and get the esp ltd ec-10! It has two high output pickups and a satan finish. Its also way more comfortable to play.	-1
Seriously - it has a hard time holding it's own weight / shape. I thought it'd be a lot stronger.  Definitely not one of my proudest Amazon purchases. Too much effort to return it however.	-1
Beware the tension.  It's extreme and can mar the back of the neck or even fingerboard.  Finctionally it can also throw off the tuning because of the tightness.  It's also huge.  Go with an manually adjustable unit which is what pros universally recommend--a Shubb or Planet Waves NS.	-1
This is a simple product and fairly easy to setup/use. But, one of the washers was severely bent, quality seems to be lacking, sadly.	-1
A little weak right out of the package  thought I'd give them a try easier on the fingers but back to normal strings	-1
I had to return it because it wouldn't go completely over my finger.  I couldn't even get it to sit on my first knuckle.  Will have to order a custom size.  It felt like stoneware too, which gave me the heebie jeebies.	-1
It is very difficult to set straps up.  Additionally, the release of the system varies. Some of the clips were very easy to release and some of the clips were pretty much impossible to separate.  I am not impressed with the set up and the quality standards.	-1
When I received this Epiphone LP Special II Les Paul Electric Guitar, Vintage Sunburst I discovered there are cracks in the wooden body, under the paint. I can tell that the wood was cracked before it was painted because the paint flows into the crack in one instance on the back, is visible up over the "shoulder" close to the strap peg and can be seen under the paint on the front. In another instance the paint bridges a crack on back below the cutout shoulder and can be seen under the paint in the right light front and back. Is this normal? (There was no sign of shipping damage on either the outer carton or on the inner product box). Regarding playing, the bass strings buzz on the frets when fretted (not my fingers) which probably can be corrected by adjusting the bridge. I was under the impression that Epiphone guitars were ready to use right out of the box. I have contacted Epiphone/Gibson company to advise on the cracks and the buzzing bass strings. I am concerned that the cracks may get worse, and if this is this normal for a guitar in this low price range made in china. I got a reply from Gibson Customer Service which said "We would need to see pictures, but it would be highly unusual if there actually were cracks in the wood. The set up on an instrument can shift during shipping and handling, so a new instrument may need to be set-up." I will probably return this instrument and buy one in person from a music store where I can see and try the product before buying it.  Update:11-12-15. I discovered another crack in the vicinity off one of the screws that holds the neck on. I sent several pictures to Gibson Products/Epiphone a few days ago but have yet to receive a reply. It seems to be a pretty good guitar but I expected it to not be cracked. Guitar was made in China. Photos attached.	-1
This does work, but its not a real Keyser capo. When it arrived i compared it to my other keyser of the same shape. 1. This label is Rights Reserved, like on the real one. 2. There are no grooves or textured handle like on the real Keyser.  I dislike when being charged for something of a brand u rely on. Only to discover its a fake. It dishonest and uses the reputation that took the Keyser Co. time to build. Just aint right. I'll buy mine at the guitar store now. Ive added a photo, the top is legit.	-1
They are very big in size, on the picture they seem a lot smaller. I didn't wanted to bother with sending them back, so I've used just strap button with rubber ring. I can't imagine that I would use this lock as intended - it's too bulky and ugly for my taste.	-1
If you're getting a starter guitar get the Jackson Dinky js 11 this guitar buzzes and can even be unpredictable	-1
Not the best.	-1
These strings are pretty bad. You get what you pay for I suppose. They aren't slick at all and wear out quickly. Shellout a few more dollars and get the Elixer strings. You won't regret it.	-1
Horrible strings! No Tone at all!	-1
I bought D'Addaria and Gibson. No comparison. Despite Martin being so cheap in price and quality, it's no wonder that D'Addario is eating their lunch. Given the choice low cheap Gibson guitars and high end American made guitars, Gibson looks like a has been in the making.	-1
These were on sale half price, when I got them they were open and the screws and lock washers were missing.  Someone apparently had installed the buttons on their guitars then sent back the locks.  I sent them back and got a quick refund then bought some Fender Strap Blocks.  They are just rubber washers that stretch to fit over the strap holder behind the strap.  Much cheaper and fit any guitar without having to drill and install new strap buttons, and they work great.  Save your money.	-1
I was very disappointed with the sound of this unit. The "vibe" effect (it's actually a Univibe-type effect, not true vibrato) sounded very "fake" to me (not at all like the Cool Cat Vibe from the same company). There was a noticeable volume drop when the effect was engaged, and I also heard some noise in my signal chain when the effect was not engaged. Combined with the (known) cheap construction, that made this pedal a big disappointment.  Based on YouTube videos, I'm going to give the Cool Cat Vibe a try... it seems to have a much more realistic Univibe sound (and apparently uses the same optical technology as the original Univibe):&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Danelectro-CV1-Cool-Cat-Vibe-Pedal/dp/B0027DO66M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Danelectro CV1 Cool Cat Vibe Pedal</a>	-1
The Epiphone Les Paul guitars don't particularly sound that great, but they stay in tune much better than the cheap squier strat you can get at the same or lower price. If your kid is serious about wanting to play guitar, but you're not completely sure if they will stick with it, if you can spend another $100 and get a used mexican made fender strat or tele. The reason for this is because for 1, if they decide it's not something they want to do anymore, you can resell it at the same price you bought it for (as long as it is still in decent condition) and little no money is lost. Second, if they do decide to stick with playing guitar and eventually own a "better" or more high end guitar, Mexican made teles or strats are great back up guitars for stage use. I have a couple different high end guitars and I will not get rid of my Mexy Strat because it sounds great still. I'll never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this.	-1
The capo I received has a shallow and short gripping ability.  It barely fit on my parlor guitar in depth and width and would not fit at all on my Ovation A/E guitar, neither of which has a very deep or wide neck.  Additionally, I found it to be difficult to grasp and open.  I threw it in the trash.	-1
This is supposed to be quick change but it is very hard to open and close. There is no way we can comfortably use this. We are keeping it since we no longer have the package it came in but we went back to our old capo after a few days of trying to get use to this one.	-1
These Kysers are OK but not really for acoustic so much. You must rely on a spring to made the decisions of how much tension is used. It's not the best science. I bought it for when I play songs and need to switch keys in the middle of the tune. I am a professional entertainer of stage so this a needed. For basic capo needs........ It's great.	-1
Never buy this. 10x better pedals for the money (See boss ds-2 or pro-co rat). I have this pedal (It was given to me) and I never use it. Don't listen to good reviews.	-1
Meh... sent it back, had better.	-1
sounds very canned and thin.  Get a DS-1 for half the price.  I love most Boss Pedals, but not this one	-1
The goose neck on this thing is so weak that it never stays in place.  I thought this thing did a good job of keeping the wind down so the p's didn't pop and the s's weren't too shrill, but I eventually bought a BSW metal windscreen and then I realized just how much better the sound could have been.  This thing is trash.	-1
It's been a while since I bought this. it worked great but 2 years after it decided not to work	-1
This pedal works ok for practicing. If you have an amp with no distortion whats so ever, I guess this will get the job done. But I STRONGLY advise against recording using this pedal. Have tried to run it to an amp and mic it. Have also tried running it straight in to a recording device, and the result is always the same: a god-awful, horrible-sounding muddy tone that cannot be helped with all the EQ in the world. It is not good for metal, or any other genre for that matter. I realize it is probably not meant to record with, but i feel that anybody who is searching for a good studio guitar tone should certainly look elsewhere. If you have a combo amp, the distortion on it is probably way better than you will get with this pedal. BOSS makes some great products, but this is definitely not one of them.	-1
Took FOREVER to arrive. Looked great. Then too difficult for my 13 year old son to use.	-1
Negative 5 stars; The button shafts stick out too far, they feel cheap and once you slip the strap button into the shaft on the guitar it has to make a "click"  sound, then you have to yank on it to make sure its on. I forgot to yank on it ONE TIME, played a few mins, let go of the guitar, it fell and hit the edge of a nearby chair and cracked the face of the electronic cavity, broke knobs switches and pots, completely wrecking one of the best axes I'll ever own. Dunlop said warranty only covers defective workmanship and not "damage due to misuse"!!?? How about damage from a shittty design that was supposed to protect against what it caused??!!!  No more Dunlop products EVER AGAIN!!!! Dimarzio Cliplock Strap pisses all over Craploks!	-1
Not suitable for a 61 key synth - although that's clearly in the description.  I had my suspicions, bought it anyway - I was right to be suspicious.  Put it on two different 61 key synths (prophet 12 and old yamaha cs1x) and it's about as "snug" as a black trash bag on your computer monitor.  I pulled the strings as far as they would go and it's still a saggy mess - then you end up with 2 feet of cord.  I'll hold on to it for use with any 76 key I might encounter, but totally worthless for something smaller.  It is decent material - but you're better off covering your 61 key with a towel than this thing.	-1
Shattered the first time I tried to attach it to a snare drum rim.  On stage, in a big hurry, disappointed.	-1
Noisy, takes 2 hands, I rather my cheap pawn shop cable	-1
huge untir. heavy, bulky and won't stay where it is clamped. frustrated. sits in closet. don't waste your money and all!!	-1
It works but I find it a very hard to get on and off the drums, which is not pleasant when the drummer is standing there watching you force this on his rim. The clips in my 100.00 Pyle Pro back up drum mic kit are better. If I had to do over I would have bought another one of those kits and used the just the mic clips out of it instead of buying a couple of these. Will not be buying any more.	-1
On off button doesn't work. Wtf?	-1
Ill start with the fact that I love the idea of this cable.  In fact I love this cable.  What I don't like and the reason that it gets 2 stars is because it does not fit on all three of my Ibanez Basses or my Kala Ubass.  It is such a tight fit that I am sure something will break.  Probably the jack will break if I continue to use it on these guitars.  It works wonderfully on both my Jazz basses.  One is a Fender and the other is a vintage 70's Ibanez Jazz bass.  I give it 2 stars because there is a chance of damage to your instrument.  It is such a basic component, how could they have gotten this wrong.	-1
A nice enough cable, BUT it slips out of the input jack on my electric piano. I've never had any other cables do this, so I'm pretty sure it's the cable and not the jack (also, I see other reviewers have occasionally noticed similar things). It's slipped out a few times in the middle of gigs, so I'm going to try to get my money back, but my hopes are not high!	-1
Cable switch doesn't work at all.  Appears to have a short straight out of the package.  Getting loud static that cuts in and out every few seconds.  This is a deal breaker!	-1
Tried installing these on a Gibson SG.  The screws that come with the straplock are longer and/or thicker than the standard ones on the SG.  Therefore, I did not want to force the dunlop screws into the guitar. The SG screws do not work with these because the heads are too big.  In essence, these did not work for me.	-1
wind screen is way too big its bulky and to me useless, the screen came out, was thinking of glueing it back in but went to ebay and bought 2 metal mesh pop filters cheaper that is MUCH better...avoid this!!	-1
These came stock on my Jackson Kelly KEXMG. All the other guitars I own have Schaller buttons on them and I have one main strap I use for all of the guitars. I figured since the guitar came with them I would try them out. Not twenty min later I was removing them and putting Schaller buttons in their place. Here the 3 major reasons I did not like them over Schaller: 1- Bulky. They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below! 2- Problems engaging. I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. It wasn't until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go. 3- Cheap. They just feel cheap. Thin metal is used in comparison to the Schallers; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them. For a few bucks more I'll stick with Schaller's. I have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail.	-1
This is a very appealing unit - but the predesigned plastic pressure arches are too 'open' for both Rico and Vandoren reeds for the clarinet (Bb).  I've ruined two reeds as the tip of the reed can easily get pinched by the hinge in any of the outside slots.  I'd block those four - but the remaining slots are also at risk - not worth the price!  A good reed easily costs $5 to $10 after culling out the less than great ones - and two destroyed reeds exceeds the cost in this item.	-1
The buttons are too big and there is only a clip that keeps the locks attached to the strap.  I think it is awful ugly and am only using this on my Frankenstein guitars.	-1
It can't holder more than 5 reeds because the case won't close because of a design flaw. It damages your reeds and the reeds still become warped. You can fix the warping by putting the case in a ziploc bag and if you're going to do that might as well also get the Rico Vitalizers.	-1
Would not stay plugged in to the back of my Taylor, and couldn't figure out why. Just could not get a secure plug in connection.	-1
the cord on the angled end is made to short to stay in my bass. i also tried several instruments, it still wouldn't stay in. i contacted D'addario, teck said they were aware of problem in some cables, he sent me a new end. very easy to change just loosen the screw and swap. Now it's a great cable.	-1
Not sure what happened. I've owned these before and found them reasonably functional, at least when considering convenience and cost. BUT this last one had a SOOOO MUCH spring tension that my 11 year old couldn't even use it. The compression on the strings was so extreme that it made the guitar (every guitar) play sharp. It's fine for pkaying solo, but you can't use it for a key change on one instrument and play with another properly tuned instrument (which is kind of the point). I'm also concerned about what it would do to frets after prolonged use. I pretty much limit it's purpose for repair and maintenance work when I need to make adjustments to something but don't want to restring the guitar.  I recommend stearing clear from these entirely.	-1
Many pro players use them because of endorsement deals with Hohner.  Pro players don't use them until several hundred dollars is spent on each harmonica to make them playable at a professional level.  I have spoken to famous professional player that endorses them.  When I spoke of them performing poorly out of the box the famous pro had to go get ready for the concert and wouldn't discuss the point I made.  Buy Suzuki Promaster for best performance for the money out of the box.  After buying more than 120 harmonicas over 40 years I have some idea which are better.	-1
Cheap junk!	-1
I would not recommend this to anyone.  Do not do what a pop filter is supposed to.  Please do not waste your money.	-1
I believe this cable is actually sounded better than my Monster cable but these died with-in 2 months. i bought 4 of these and 3 crapped out in less than 2 months. Lucky Planet Waves replaced them cause Amazon doesnt accept returns after 30days.	-1
I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product. A work-around for the main issue follows the review. The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:  1) Quality: Very weak soft-metal screws. Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with. 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later, causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws.  2) Engineering : The instructions recommend, and the screws (the ones that come with the straplocks) are designed for a #2 Phillips screwdriver. However, a standard #2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons. So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit, or using a #1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job.  3) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar. The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch. Therefore any lateral stress (i.e. weight of the guitar) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw. A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course). Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.  Realistically, if the screws weren't total crap, this might have been a 3 or 4 star review. Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won't fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people. So if you are stuck with a set, here's what I recommend:  Go to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. Note that these won't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (They are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)  Put the screw into an electric drill (pointy end in) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. It doesn't need much. I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. While you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.  Install with the new screws as normal, and recommend that your friends try a different brand!	-1
Sorry, I don't like these as they're just too big. They stand out too much. They do work and they're effective but they are too pronounced. There are many good alternatives; strap gaskets, strap locks, undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap.  Again, they work, but they're not aesthetic nor elegant. I also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like I should be wearing big purple platforms when I play. Not cool.	-1
I bought this based on the good write-ups about these but was disappointed when they arrived.  They feel like cheap pressed metal and are very clanky.  Recommend getting more substantial strap locks from another manufacturer if you need them.	-1
very very slow delivery. not happy	-1
I love Ernie Ball and I've been a regular user over the years. I was so negatively surprisde by the fact that there were some coating defects on the first string. This is simply not acceptable. I'll take my chances with D'addario	-1
Went to local place to check out hands-on.  I was not impressed at all.  The thing just felt cheap.  I could not imagine playing it for long.  It was not fun to hold and parts looked cheesy.	-1
This capo is inadequate for my needs. It has trouble producing enough tension and is fiddly regarding intonation.  Prefer Shubb.	-1
I got this case with an off-Brand Les Paul copy. Looks nice, but one of the latches keeps popping open when carrying it with a guitar inside, and the inner wall by the headstock is coming off. $99 is ridiculously priced for this thing. If it was the same kind of case they use for the Gibsons, maybe, but those are different.  I have 2 Musician's Gear Les Paul cases that are more solid and about half the price. Musician's Gear is Guitar Center/Musician's Friend's store brand, but can be found here as well. It's possible I just got a bad Epiphone case, but if I had to buy a case for another Les Paul, I'd avoid this one.	-1
I own a '84 Martin D-12-28 and a '03 Martin J12-16GT guitars. This has to be the worst capo on the market for a 12 string guitar especially Martin 12 string guitars because of their wider necks. What I noted about this capo is that it notoriously knocks the guitar out of tune 9 out of 10 times. You cannot have that performing live. Absolutely not. I would not recommend this to anyone especially Martin owners to not buy this. Spring for the G7 guitar capo instead. More pricey? Yes. But well worth the money spent.	-1
I use this with my Rogue Herringbone 12-string.  I does a good job, but I still have issues getting all the strings firmly pressed which is probably due to the action only being factory set.  Revised...I finally decided it just doesn't live up to the name for my need.	-1
I purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good. Looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. Does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. I would have returned it but I completely destroyed the package getting it open (which oddly had staples holding it closed).	-1
The pencil holder has no bottom piece so the pencil slips out.  The pockets holding the music are too small for full size scores.  Don't like it.	-1
This didn't work well for my 12 string acoustic. It wasn't tight enough to hold down the Low E strings. Got buzzes and muted string sounds throughout the fret board. Check out the Planet Waves NS Capo Pro 6 and 12 string. I really like that one. See my recommendation for that.	-1
I ordered this product to use for personal recording, and thought...what could possibly go wrong? I ordered it "New," and it definitely shows signs that it not new. First, the package was stapled, that's right- STAPLED together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened. Then, to make matters worse, there is a hole in one side of the fabric. When I order something new, I expect it to be new. Based on this product alone, I would not recommend buying from this seller.	-1
I have four Roland DP-2's and three are broken. They stop working and get stuck 'on' for no reason. I don't think I'll buy another.  [DW]	-1
No doubt, this pedal produces Distortion sounds. It's probably adequate for messing around with or as a first DS pedal (and the price is certainly economical), but I would not say that it produces high-quality distortion for rhythm playing. Yes, I know it's a classic- it's just not for me. It may be useful for some lead guitar, but the sound is very 'fizzy' and thin sounding- not a rich, complex tone by any means. I purchased the Boss DS-1X instead- we'll see how that sounds.	-1
i got this case and it wouldnt close right,the lock broke, just junky,not well put together get a skb or a gibson case,this ones cheap and you get what u pay for here	-1
Looks cool.. but awkward it is upside down compared to the jim dunlop which I find much easier to use	-1
I bought an Ephiphone Les Paul Tribute Plus and this case was included with the guitar. It will protect your guitar around the house and going to practice. The quality is exceptionally poor. The cover is soft and tears really easy even with a gentle bump. The trim that covers the seam on the outside fabric was loose on mine and soon to fall off. Epiphone sent me a replacement case and it was just as bad as the first. I bought a Gator abs case and while it is not a flight case, is much more durable than this case.  It was "free" with the Tribute, but it just makes me question the quality standards of Epiphone - although the Tribute Plus could not be a nicer, better made guitar.	-1
unless you find real vintage-made in japan, metal screw, this new ones-made in Taiwan or China, sounds cheap. Even with made in Japan, there are different types. I have that review on guitar fan site. For new players, I recommend Keeley Mod. As is with those big company, they lose true quality after they get famous and seek for more profit. Fender, Gibson, Yamaha...Coach bag company is a perfect example.	-1
Very muddy tone. Not good for metal	-1
Skip this intro pedal and go to something a bit better for maybe a little more. An mxr overdrive/distortion, a used Ibanez overdrive, a pro co rat, even a digitech hot head or hot rod. This is one of those pedals that sounds ok but is know for the Boss "ice pick" trebly sound. This is one of those pedals everybody has had but has moved on.	-1
Don't even bother w this pedal, it sounds like balls..	-1
Here's the deal with this pedal. It is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money. In my opinion, for spending less than $100 for a distortion pedal, whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal, a few more bucks will get you the MXR Badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it.	-1
First some background: I've been playing bass for 2 years have used Line 6, Eden, Peavey, Orange, Marshall and Kustom amps and Ibanez, Peavey, JB Player, Fender, Yamaha, and Squire bass'.  This bass was a serious disappointment.  I've got a lot of love for Gibson and (due to $$$) Epiphone.  When I saw the Epiphone EB series in my local guitar shop I fell in love.  How can you not appreciate that SG body, and I've always preferred humbuckers to P or J pickups.  I thought I had found my hearts desire when I picked this up and began to play (classic rock & blues covers for reference) and then my heart broke.  The sound was lousy.  Of course I tried a different EB bass and different amps but the situation never improved.  Despite my sincerest wishes I can't recommend this excellent looking bass to anyone (unless they're looking for wall art or are willing to switch out the pickups).  You can pay the same price and get much better tone (I would recommend a Squire Jaguar if you really want a humbucker or if you want more tone versatility a Yamaha RBX 170).	-1
The hiss is irritating......resembling the technology of the 1970s hardware.  I believe that Boss can correct the poor design creating the unbearable hiss.	-1
Basic distortion / nothing fantastic. Range is limited . Its a good pedal for someone just starting out. Constructed well looks good sounds less than average. Tried to drive it and it just gets worse. Great pedal for a kid to play with but on stage don't bother. Selling mine off for some new strings. For the cost your getting ripped off / go with Mod Tone or DigiTech you can't go wrong.	-1
From Greg Abrams review, entitled "For all but the tone snobs," a review further down on this product's page:  "Alright, so you want to get a good (if somewhat "basic") distortion sound for less than $100? This is your deal."  I strongly disagree.  You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for $100 or less, even a few near or under the $40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced at.  I've played guitar for over 10 years.  Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1.  Afterall, everyone talks about them, they're available at any given music store in the nation, you hear about all these famous musicians using them, plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap!  So I snapped one up just like everyone else.  Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR, that doesn't always mean its GOOD (see: Nickelback, the Transformers movie franchise, the Kardashian family, etc...).  So I plugged it in and didn't really care for it.  The distortion was harsh, thin, artificial sounding and always noisy.  I tried it on both my amps (My practic amp: a solid state Fender Frontman 25R, and my big amp, the B-52 AT100, which is a 100w tube halfstack) It was was not very diverse, and the basic sound was not very likeable to me.  I've read the Japanese made DS-1's are better in sound than the newer, made in Taiwan models but, either way, the DS-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind.  But, like many newer players, I didn't know any better at the time.  Fast forward a few years and I've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals.  There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open.  So here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1.  All of them are great general purpose distortions, easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops, and can, at the time of this writing, be bought brand new for $75 or less here on good ol' Amazon.com, and are rugged enough to last for years:  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Boss-DS-2-Turbo-Distortion/dp/B0002CZV8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion</a>:  Lest I catch any flames from people thinking I'm a Boss hater (I'm certainly not, I loved the TU-3, the ODB-3, the MD-2, and the XT-2, among others) I'll start with the DS-1's big brother.  This pedal has a much nicer tone to it, not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes.  The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS-1, the II setting is a brighter, richer tone.  As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity, you can find DS-2's all over ebay for very cheap prices.  A very worthy pedal, unfortunately overlooked by many.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Pro-Co-RAT2/dp/B0002MSQVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Pro Co RAT2</a>:  Great dirty distortion pedal.  Probably my personal favorite.  You've heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years, its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists.  Its a rich, full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy.  I've never heard a bad tone out of mine. Its great for getting a "big amp" kind of sound out of a small practice amp.  Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume.  A truly excellent pedal.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/EHX-Little-Big-Muff/dp/B000T517Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">EHX Little Big Muff</a>:  The Big Muff is another pedal you've heard on hundreds of songs.  Its kind of a fuzz, kind of a distortion, but definitely owns its own sonic territory.  Very big, saturated and warm.  Used heavily in the 70's for classic rock tones, also in the 90's and beyond for tons of grunge and garage.  Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White.  I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff, not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue, its smaller, uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER!  A great pedal.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/MXR-Distortion/dp/B0002E520C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">MXR Distortion +</a>:  The Distortion + is a great first distortion, and can usually be found pretty cheap.  Whats nice about the Distortion + is that it sounds great on anything, and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent, i.e. you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp, it doesn't cover over your equipments sound.  Used by quite a few famous folks, including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhoads (Ozzy's famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Danelectro-CM-1-Cool-Cat-Metal/dp/B000A40NAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal</a>:  Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal, NOT the Metal II.  That's a fine pedal as well, but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal.  The Cool Cat Metal, or CM-1, is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals.  Basically, its a pre-amp that sits on the floor.  It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof.  So you can do anything from a clean boost (with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone) to high gain metal stuff, with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between.  It works well with any amp I've tried it on, and you can find tons of great sounds.  Its an unbelievably versatile pedal, and its even true bypass.  The best part is, Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them, so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30.  A true hidden gem that's actually CHEAPER than a DS-1.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Joyo-JF-03-Crunch-Distortion/dp/B005LYIW3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion</a>:  This little guy surprised me.  Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box, and, if so, that must be one awesome pedal too.  Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box, and boy does it ever succeed at that.  Great crunch, tons of volume and gain, it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin' stack!  It even sounded good going into my modeling amp (very few pedals work well with my modeling amp, and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in), and you can get a brand new one for $40 shipped, fantastic!  Speaking of Joyo, I've had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN, another Chinese pedal maker, and I'm honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag (especially the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/MOEN-MO-FM-Fuzz-Moo/dp/B007L5PVI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">MOEN MO-FM Fuzz Moo</a>&nbsp;which honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff I've ever played through).  So JOYO and MOEN, they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz, od, and dirt pedals, check them out (and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company, please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review, DS-1 included, are made in America, let alone the western hemisphere).  Hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for.  Also, if you can't actually try a pedal out at the store, YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.  I should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs, than more power to you.  Tone is subjective, every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps, and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love, that's okay.  My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information.  You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals, the DS-1 is NOT the only thing out there that's affordable.  Find something you truly love and buy that.  If its the DS-1, one of the pedals I've mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to YOU.	-1
This unit is a servicable tuner, and metronome, but you can do better in both departments for sure.  I find it useless for acoustic guitars if there is any background noise.  Even just a TV on with normal volume nearby seems to prevent it from getting a clean read.  The metronome is annoying because of the lack of volume, and the fact that it's plays an electronic tone instead of clicks.  Not a good idea.  Metronomes should click..  click click click click....	-1
This is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says, it distorts, You want something to make your guitar sound like junk, this will do it. Why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me. This is not a boutique Distortion pedal like Hendrix would use. Boutique and distortion are an oxymoron.   These things are built with heavy metal, it should last, I kinda hope it doesn't(just kidding), you want distortion, you got distortion	-1
Metronome is not loud enough for any serious practicing with any instrument.  The tuner does not track pitch very well.	-1
I thought I could plug in my headphones and use the metronome but NOPE.  The tuner works like any other tuner.  The metronome has diffrent settings but can't hear them cuz I can't plug in my headphones.  It's kind of hard to hear over live drums.	-1
This tuner is alright. It works best in quiet environment. I used this tuner to help when tuning my acoustic guitar. I exchanged it for another tuner. Now I regret it. Sometimes I have to pluck the strings especially the high e several times to get it to register. I was confused with how to use the metronome. It had things like 0/4 1/4 etc. I didn't get that. The metronome was strange because it did not display time signatures . Also the beep sound was unusual for a metronome.	-1
For the price I've seen better...it really isn't all it's cracked up to be and the construction of it is just wrong...plastic? Really?  I took it back and got something better.	-1
I just don't get why so many people use this capo. In my experience, it is useless.  The spring is so tight, that it's going to pull some of your strings (probably the E,B and G) out of tune, every time you barre a fret with it. If you enjoy re-tuning continually, then you will probably like this capo.  But I suggest you spend a little more and get the Planet Waves Tri-Action Capo. It will save you time and grief. The Tri-Action Capo keeps every string in tune, while giving a great tone, unlike the sharp, harsh tone that the Kyser produces. And yes, you can park it on the head when not in use.  Forget this capo, and invest in the Planet Waves Tri-Action cap.	-1
The handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar, and I feel rushed to clamp on the capo because it's unpleasant to use - hurts the fingers. It's cheap and easy to use. It'll do the job, but I don't like it.	-1
Very sturdy picks but also very hard to hold on to as the surface of these picks have no grip at all.	-1
I bought one of these in July of 2013.  I had a black one that I have owned for over 10 years and works great.  This one, the spring doesn't keep the string down snug enough to prevent buzzing.  A complete waste of money.  I am going to buy one of these in the future...http://smile.amazon.com/G7th-Performance-Capo-String-Silver/dp/B0007GGUGA/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&ie=UTF8&qid=1447375034&sr=1-1&keywords=g7%20capo%20for%20acoustic%20guitar My friend who is a professional highly recommends the one above.	-1
The 1.0 mm Dunlop Ultex feel MUCH thinner than 1.0.  Very flimsy and small.  No grip.  Stay with your old Dunlops, these Ultex Dunlops are terrible.  Dreadful.	-1
I would probably not purchase a again.  Overall looks are great but quality and duribility are not there!!  Not bad for the price!	-1
I got this for my Boss Loop Station, but it doesn't work very well.  I keep hoping I'll find something it DOES work well with...	-1
I have to take back my favorable review from before. After playing this for awhile I noticed that the sound breaks often on the higher register, and the headpiece seems to clog up very easily. I think the headpiece slot is too narrow and cramped on one side and there is some wood sharding inside the headpiece, which came this way new. I have now read similar complaints form other posters (which I should have read before -- I think all the glowing reports are either from shills or total beginner recorder players who mistake the fine finish for fine musical craftsmanship). What didn't this company turn out a precision instrument to begin with? And is it made in China or Germany -- it sure plays like it was made in China. Needless to say, I am very disappointed to spend thirty dollars on what doesn't even work properly and I will seek a refund. (By the way, I have played the recorder for fifty years and have a dozen plastic and wooden ones -- this is the only one clearly defective.)	-1
not bad.	-1
I bought the wrong gauge. I read a review that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong. I bought the .90 gauge at Guitar Center and love them. These were made for that Dave Mustain muted crunch sound. I don't know if I will use these forever but for right now I love them. Just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do.    Dunlop Ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new.  Buy em!!!!	-1
It is indeed better looking than the cheap plastic recorders, but mine came out of tune (specifically the F note), making it unplayable. It also came scratched, so it doesn't look so good when you look closely.	-1
My case came with one broken latch. The shipping box was fine and the case was packed ok. It must have happened when it was manufactured. I fixed it with JB weld but I shouldn't have had to do this with a new $100 case.	-1
really bad. I am terribly irritated by this. As a rule I use Aquila and love the sound and how they hold the tuning is well. These strings are barely able to stay strung and keep coming loose. End result is that I bought a new set of strings.  You guessed it they are Aquila. Maybe it is just a case of a set of seconds' but whatever the reason I will not use them again.  I pitched these because of the name brand' ask have several classic Martins and thought the sane workmanship would be in these I was wrong. My 1st string won't even stay on my uke. All my other units which inck led my beloved concert and the sawtoothPinapple sound rich mellow and really hold their tunning. Good luck maybe you'll b more fortunate.	-1
This thing was not good at all. I returned it.	-1
Luckily this is only used to store a particular guitar in my house but this bag is barely more than a cheap dust cover. Very little padding. I wouldn't trust to take it out with a band and risk it getting tossed around too harshly. For the money it works but not really impressed. I expected a bit more from Epiphone.	-1
Recieved product but the tightening bolt plastic was broken. The clamp was still useable. Very large mounting bolt and may not work for smaller lights	-1
I'm really sorry to say that it was very disappointing. Believe it or not, very difficult to install. I imagine if you have a $5,000.00 Gibson Mastertone, you might have better results. I, on the other hand, didn't and had to relocate the banjo's top rimrod and modify the pickup mounting bracket just to get it to clear the banjo's head. The sound was adequate.	-1
Is not a good product. You can find something better. Its hard to make that work fine. Its always with problems.	-1
NOT GOOD FOR HEAVY LIGHTS	-1
Nice bag, but does not fit Epiphone Dot as mentioned.	-1
This pickup didn't work out too well. Even though I adjusted it to almost touch the strings it still fail to pick up the vibration of the G, B and small E strings. It has a curve to it that puts the ends farther away from the strings than the middle section and there's no way to adjust it enough to get it close to those smaller stings. I've never played a guitar with a curve to the strings that would fit this pickup. It's a very odd and unworkable design. In addition, I couldn't deal with the slight delay that a guitar synthesizer causes when processing the signal. Having the sound come out a split second after I pick the string messes up my timing terribly. Some musicians can deal with it just fine, but I'm not one of those guys.	-1
The back straps are connect by metal hooks which dig into your skin when carrying it. Anyone with a Epi knows these things can get heavy so the metal hooks being weighed down on your shoulders is painful and can snag your hair if its shoulder length or more. Remove the metal hooks and its a good bag. I would suggest adding a pocket on the front that holds those skinny practice books and 8x11 paper.	-1
I thought buying it directly to Fishman would guarantee a good deal. But it didn't. First of all, it didn't come in a box. It came wrapped in a paper. So, when I was going to install it on my banjo, a surprise: it's missing the blue steel shim. And I don't live in the USA, so I'll have to figure out a way to get a new one or improvise.  It's a shame.	-1
but unfortunately that is it's best quality. This is outdated technology, and I so wish I could sell mine. Who would I sell it to? I would have to tell them that it does not work very well. I have never encountered the clip problem, but for a buck and a half this SHOULD be better. Equalizers fail to remove the sound of your fingers plucking the strings. The finger sound IS the prevalent sound. Save your money for something better.	-1
It arrived and in the process of installing the pickup found that there were missing parts namely the screw driver and short guitar cable. Then when I got it done and ready to test I found that the guitar switch didn't work therefore the combination guitar/synth didn't work either. One installed I'm not going to uninstall and return. I found a way around the all issues so there you have it. Just buy a new one.	-1
Be aware of your guitar dimensions, as although this product description states it is 17 inches wide, I could not fit my Indie 12 string that is 15 inches wide. My guitar is 41 inches long. This case did not fit. Too short. Too bad as you can't beat the price.	-1
Would not purchase again.  Not much padding.  Spend a little more and get something that will actually protect your guitar.  Cheers	-1
These sticks are nothing like Promark before they were purchased by D'Addario. They don't look as cool, there's no sumo wrestler. Also, the paint rubs off very easy. The wood doesn't seem to be as good of quality as the originals either. Overall, very disappointed.	-1
For the price I thought it would out perform a graphic EQ. Was disappointed because my EQ was less in price and does much more than this unit. I do not recommend this product	-1
Not even close to fitting my guitar. sorry : ( maybe my ukelele? not recommended. Said they would replace this, not recieved in over a month.	-1
As the title states, this is a lightly padded duffle bag, nothing more. If you're toating between practice with an instructor, it's okay. I purchased it for that reason...and I'm an adult, so I can be careful. This bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage. I would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag. It will prevent my guitar from scuffs, dings, dent & dirt, but that's it.  There are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason I gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price.	-1
Bought it to switch between two tube amp but I can't get rid of loud hum.  Further search pointed to ground loop.  Solution is to buy another device (Hum X) which cost another $50+ each.  Returning it and look for other alternative.	-1
EDIT:  3/14/2013  All good things must come to an end.  Kyser no longer donates money to the Komen foundation, the lifetime warranty has been shortened to a 1 year warranty, Kyser's latest products do not say, "Made in USA" on them, and all that good mojo has pretty much been sold up the river trying to squeeze a couple more pennies out of their customers...  For about eleven dollars LESS, you can buy a high quality Kyser knock-off, right here on Amazon, and put the extra money into your own pocket instead of into the hands of some greedy MBA types who ruined what used to be a great American product.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  For every pink capo sold, Kyser donates a dollar to the Susan G. Komen foundation.  Also, Kyser capos are made in the USA by Americans.  A good product, a good cause, a good company, and good mojo...  And what better way to impress the ladies!?  ;-)  Charity starts at HOME!	-1
My MMV supposedly came with these on it. I guess I bought a bad batch because these sound awful	-1
Very sturdy picks but also very hard to hold on to as the surface of these picks have no grip at all.	-1
I purchased the Morley ABY splitter so I could use my amp (Marshall DSL  only one input) to drive two instruments and so I could move quickly from my guitar to my steel. My 2 rating of the Morley splitter is due to its inability to handle a wireless input source properly. When you're using the A and B switching option (both instruments are hot) and one of the two instruments is wireless, attenuation/volume loss is in the neighborhood of 80% for the instrument connected via a traditional instrument cable. Also, when using two instruments, both connected via traditional instrument cable inputs, and you're using the same A and B switching option, there is still a noticeable reduction in volume (imo: 10% loss). From what I can tell, when using two instruments, both connected via traditional instrument cable inputs, and you're using the A or B switching option, there is no noticeable loss of volume or tone. Ive performed extensive troubleshooting just to make sure these issues were not caused by a faulty cable or instrument (single coil vs humbucker, etc.). So, I cycled three of my guitars (American Deluxe Strat  single & double coils; Les Paul; Peavey PowerSlide lap steel  also single/double coil) through the different input channels. All scenarios produced the same result as mentioned above.	-1
The 1.0 mm Dunlop Ultex feel MUCH thinner than 1.0.  Very flimsy and small.  No grip.  Stay with your old Dunlops, these Ultex Dunlops are terrible.  Dreadful.	-1
One of the poorer buys from Amazon. When I received mine it had "Ripples" in the covering skin and one could tell it was poorly made The person in Quality Assurance must have been asleep when this case was shipped. My guitar "Epiphone Hummingbird" fits OK in the case But the top of the case is warped and you have to fight with it to get the buckles to close and lock.  It would have been a pain to ship it back to Amazon so I kept it. I do not like it !!!  Would not recommend purchase of this case.  Update: Now that a few years have gone by the case is still in good shape. The fabric wrinkles are still there and it takes effort to close the buckles because of warpage but nothing has gotten worse. The case is very heavy and that is a drawback. It has protected my Hummingbird however. For those that wonder if the Gibson Hummingbird will fit in this case yes it does. The size of the gibson and epi versions of the Hummingbird are virtually the same size.	-1
On my Ibanez acoustic, it only properly frets 5 of the 6 strings. Depending how I set it, either the low E or the high e would buzz obnoxiously.  I returned it for a Dunlop, which works beautifully.	-1
I have a Schubb now, which kicks the clamp-on capo's behind.  This works good for my banjo that doesn't require as much tension, but I have a hard time getting this to work on my steel string	-1
Strings arrived with rust on the plain strings.	-1
WHAT ON EARTH DO THEY MEAN BY PERFECTLY PLAYABLE?   I'm sorry for yelling,  but I actually paid "good money" for these,  because they showed up as an "add on" item,  and at the time there were four starts next to them. I should have gone to the trouble of reading all of the reviews,  but sadly,  I "added them on" based on the cursory glance. I hope my one star review will help someone else avoid making this mistake. And shame on them,  for saying these are perfectly playable. I bought FOUR and not ONE of them makes more than a horrible one-note high-pitched off-tune SCREEKING. These should be sold as beads,  or charms,  that look like "real harmonicas" NOT as playable instruments.	-1
Garbage. I bought 4 as gifts. Tested one. So bad I tested all four. Into the garbage they went. At $2 apiece I wasn't expecting much, but I wouldn't give one of these to anyone for any reason.  The Hohner "Little Lady" is the same size, but actually plays nicely. It's what you want. Get that instead. $10 more, but you'll actually have a charming & playable necklace harp.  Or if you don't need to wear it, upsize a little a get a Seydel BIG SIX for $35. Six full sized, rich sounding holes in a wonderfully machined pocket sized harp. Soooo much better than any other mini-harp out there. Yesy, a BIG SIX, costs the same as a pretty decent full sized harp, but the virtue is it really is small enough to keep on you at all times while providing full-sized, really beautiful sound.  But this Hohner 38C is an insult & a waste, even at $2. Do better. Be happier.	-1
Would not buy again. Thought it would be okay, but it is not really playable. $2 key chain that I'm giving away to someone because I don't want it now. Extra star since it's $2.	-1
I bought the wrong gauge. I read a review that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong. I bought the .90 gauge at Guitar Center and love them. These were made for that Dave Mustain muted crunch sound. I don't know if I will use these forever but for right now I love them. Just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do.    Dunlop Ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new.  Buy em!!!!	-1
sent it back because no back light on screen,	-1
a bit too short, even for 6 string lap steel.  the end of the bar tends to get hung up on the high strings when i play on the lower strings and then return to the high strings.  get the long dawg instead. :)	-1
Intended to maximize sales appeal to a wide range of musicians, the SR16 offers 50 different drum beat styles (rock, jazz, country, etc.) using up to 12 pieces of percussion instruments (kick, snare, cymbals, toms, etc.) making up a drum set. Each piece is assigned to a physical drum pad button on the face of the SR16. For me, I found only about a dozen factory-installed drum beat styles (called presets) I can use. Of these, I can easily change the tempo for live performances. BUT this is where easy ends. When I wanted to make changes to one of the presets, the instructions were of minimal help. Although it attempts to explain how to do a task, the instructions are generic, fragmented, and wordy. From the time I opened the box until I finally figured out how to make simple changes, I have spent three weeks in trial and error and handwrote a dozen pages of my own notes, tables, and instructions, just so I can use the SR16 adequately. I have not even attempted to create anything new and cannot imagine the nightmare it would be. This has been a frustrating experience, to say it respectfully. The reasons I plowed through all this frustration were 1) customer ratings and comments, 2) the lack of a reasonably priced competitive drum machines, and 3) the sounds were actually good enough for my limited use (Im a guitarist). Other shortcomings: 1)  there are no options for drum intros and extros 2) you cannot throw in a drum fills randomly which is very restrictive during a live, spontaneous performance when you cannot keep track of which beat you're on (the SR16 accepts two foot pedals) 3) the display is not backlit and is difficult to read under low light conditions as youd expect in a performance 4) some buttons are dual function but unlabeled, some buttons are toggle, some are momentary, some are single function; you just have to memorize which does what 5) no trouble shooting guide 6) a step-reference users chart inconveniently affixed underneath the SR16 instead of printed in the Reference Guide or as a separate card Im giving the SR16 a rating of one star because, although a great sounding drum machine, it is useless if you cannot use it. The instructions barely bridge the gap between a great machine and a great useable machine. Unless you have plenty of undisturbed time, lots of patience, and undeterred to writing copious notes, I would not recommend this $150 machine for you.	-1
Nothing at all like the original I owned in the mid 80s. Its more complicated and doesnt have as many options. I found a older version on ebay. But I chose to but new for the same price. Now the ebay unit has been sold.	-1
Terrible synthetic sounding drums. Very weak on jazz and blues rhythms, not particularly intuitive either. I never use it.	-1
pretty let down here... and the buttons are pretty difficult to use, have to press really hard, and that isn't a guarantee to get it to sound	-1
working now	-1
Quite shrill initial sound and then completely dead within a couple of days. I also found them very stiff given the gauge.  I went back to my John Pearse 200L 80/20's. No matter how many different strings I try I come to the same conclusion; The Pearse 200L's are the best strings in the world.	-1
So, what do ya do when the chrome plating cracks and starts peeling off???  I can understand why a complex design such as this would be expensive to be made out of pure stainless..  but unplated brass would work, too!  Would be nice to know it's length, not merely its weight...  The design seems quite functional and is esthetically pleasing ...	-1
very unintuitive module, very bad pad response which are also very small so not easy to use. The sounds are so, so. The only plus of this unit is the price, but anyway not very usable. I sold it within a month with 50% loss and got Boss DR-880. That what I should do in first place..	-1
When I opened the package the E strings were misplaced with the B strings and I think maybe Martin Co. could be a bit more careful and attentive in how their strings are packaged Great sounding strings. I have them on a Walden of mine and they resonate well and give a strong tone.	-1
While this is a very cool looking cable, it is quite stiff and curls and tangles up on itself, and wraps up any other cords nearby in the process. I would not buy it again.	-1
I've had an SR-16 for years.  Loved it; used it regularly.  I loved it so much, I started writing Alesis about 10 years ago, asking them to update the sounds to 16-bit.  I bought the SR-18 the day it came out.  Now I'm going to Ebay it.  I need a drum machine for practice.  With a couple of foot pedals, you can run the SR-16 while you and the other guitarists do your thing.  Stop, start, decent fills that are completely logical and predictable.  But the SR-18 is just about worthless in that role.  Yeah, it sounds gorgeous, but it's just unusable as a live-performance tool.  I mean, maybe it's OK if you want to program every single song you do, but to just start it and jam on a song, forget it.  Here are some of the weird things:  Genres not grouped together.  Wouldn't you expect one click to take you from Rock 1 to Rock 2?  Not so.  If you're looking for a rock beat, you have to look all over the list to find the next one.  Different tempos for each pattern.  So. . .you're playing along a 130 bpm but you decide you need a slightly different rhythm.  You dial in a different pattern and wham, you're suddenly playing at 210 bpm.  What's with that??  Different track lengths for each pattern.  On the old SR-16, all patterns were 2 bars; eight beats.  Boring, maybe, but useful and predictable.  It was easy to insert a fill because you knew what was coming.  On the SR-18, some patterns are 16 beats, some are 8, some are 20. . .I forget.  But there you are, jamming along and you go to the Fill function to bring you to the chorus. . .and it starts the fill 8 beats too late.  Sheesh.  With the SR-16 I got so good, I could just tap my footswitch and get a single cymbal crash at the end of a phrase.  Not possible now. . .at least, not without years of study.  So: this machine is probably swell if you intend to program each song you do--and play it exactly the same way each time.  If, like me, you used the SR-16 for practice, for extending a jam while your lead guitarist got his act together, for a quick simple beat that did the job most of the time. . .save your money.  Stick with your old SR-16.  That's what I'm doing.  Alesis, you broke my heart!  Why couldn't you just give us the same great functionality of the SR-16, but with better sounds?	-1
The spectraflex material is a great concept but I am constantly fighting with this thing as it wants to twist on itself and constantly finds a way to get tangled. It is too rigid or something. You would think it would help it resist tangling but it is the exact opposite. The best moment you will ever have with it is right as you are taking it out of the wrapper. It is all down hill, disappointment and frustration from there.	-1
This cable caused my amp to pickup am radio stations. I swapped it out with my VOX cable and the problem went away. Connected it back up and the am radio station came back. I do not recommend this cable and replaced it with a Planet Waves American Stage cable which is awesome and has top quality shielding.	-1
Long story short, this string set has a strong metallic character, which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. Many people might like it, but for me, absolutely Noooooooo!  I have a seagull guitar, so by its nature it sounds mellow, warm and mild with stock strings. So when my strings wear out, I got this. Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtop's neck position, WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer. Yes, it is that bad, you can't do this to guitars like Seagulls...  Bottom line, I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. If you have guitars like seagulls or so, definitely avoid this string.	-1
Well, what can I say? Based on the customer reviews, this purchase seemed like a no-brainer. However, after only 4 months of light use (used on my rig at home) it is toast. The cable barely holds a signal now (constantly need to jiggle the thing to work). And before you ask, "is it perhaps your output jack?", all of my other cables work with my gee-tar. So it is definitely the cable :( Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because while it WAS working it sounded great through my Roland JC120.	-1
I purchased these awhile ago, just put them on, the 4th and 6 BOTH broke! I have restrung my guitar many times. NEVER had this happen. Will not be buying them again.	-1
I received this guitar for my birthday and I was very excited play it as I had wanted a new acoustic bass for many years.  As I started to play, it became apparent very quickly that this guitar was a cheap piece of junk. I have played many Dean guitars over the years and I have always thought that Dean made a quality product. The action on this instrument is terrible. The last several frets were actually touching the stings. Also, the end of the frets were extremely sharp and made it almost impossible to play. Dean obviously has no quality control with this product. Buyer beware!!!  I am very disappointed with this guitar and I will be returning it immediately. I have no plans to purchases a Dean guitar again.	-1
I've got a #3 and it felt like a Rico #4. Very hard reed. I could not use one. A waste of money.	-1
These strings are cheap so thats a plus but thats about it with the sound more resembling banjo stings.  I simply could not get a good sound out these even though I tried and tried.  Everything just doesn't sound right and more metallic and too sharp for my ears.  I played for my wife who said that they sounded really bad.  They are really thin and feel cheap almost like the strings that came with my violin (a cheap violin).  Do yourself a favor and pay extra for good strings but than again if these stings would of been five or ten bucks than I would be happy knowing what I would probably be getting.  These strings would be a good starting point though so don't get me wrong.  I just have learned to like better and little more expensive strings.	-1
Switched to Red... Love the Red!	-1
G string broke on first tune up didn't even get up to E.	-1
After reading dozens of reviews on these Preludes, I am becoming convinced that most people here on Amazon trying them out haven't yet heard what decent strings are supposed to sound like.  I generally keep Overture Ultras on my violin which are are fairly close in price to these (love the sound of Helicores, but they're really loud if you're just a living-room player and are double the price).  Tried the Preludes for the first time a month ago as a set came with my daughter's new 1/2 sized violin.  I tried to be open minded, gave them over a week to stretch in properly....and they still sounded awful.  Tinny quality, very little resonance, and just sounded lousy compared to my daughter's 1/4 violin.  Finally gave up and switched out the Preludes with a set of Overture Ultras with the wound E string.  Night and day difference.  Now I am fully aware that different strings can sound differently on different instruments, but I was seriously underwhelmed with the Preludes.	-1
Good response and feel; nice, quieter sound.  However, the individuals dowels splinter and break rather easily, and after only two months of playing each rod went from 19 dowels to about 10 dowels (and the change in sound and feel was noticeable).  I recommend using Vic Firth's bamboo tala wands instead.  BLUF:  Not recommended.	-1
Stopped working after a month. Don't buy this item.	-1
Poor quality. The capo is to tight and causes strings to sound sharp.  The metal spring broke after three months.  Do not buy.	-1
This is my first harmonica holder purchase and the first one I've actually used so I don't have much to compare it to. It seems to be well built but the ergonomics aren't quite right. I have a pretty average body type and I just can't get it into position where I can play comfortably. It's getting a lot less use than I expected. I would recommend looking for alternatives.	-1
This capo is not acceptable for acoustic guitars with low tension, as the clamping force is so tight that it bends the strings up. I would recommend getting an easily adjustable capo instead for much more versatility for the same price. I have seen the videos about adjusting this capo, and I am a 200 pound male who lifts weights daily and it hurt my hand and took a very long time to pull the capo looser. Even then, the tension was not equal across all strings. I would much rather turn a knob than gorilla force this into a suitable position.	-1
Beware the tension.  It's extreme and can mar the back of the neck or even fingerboard.  Finctionally it can also throw off the tuning because of the tightness.  It's also huge.  Go with an manually adjustable unit which is what pros universally recommend--a Shubb or Planet Waves NS.	-1
This does work, but its not a real Keyser capo. When it arrived i compared it to my other keyser of the same shape. 1. This label is Rights Reserved, like on the real one. 2. There are no grooves or textured handle like on the real Keyser.  I dislike when being charged for something of a brand u rely on. Only to discover its a fake. It dishonest and uses the reputation that took the Keyser Co. time to build. Just aint right. I'll buy mine at the guitar store now. Ive added a photo, the top is legit.	-1
Iffy quality.  Broke the E string without much force.	-1
A great idea but these sticks are very delicate and break VERY easily. The bamboo styles are much more durable.	-1
Ordered the case and it came damaged so badly that it looked like it have been run over by a vehicle. the end of the case had a two inch opening when the case was in closed and locked position. Wow? The packaging is not adequate to protect the high performance travel case!?! Returned the case and ordered a second time.  The case once again came UPS and it was damaged again.  The case wass bent and did not properly seal when in the closed position.  Packaging was torn and looked like it was at the bottom pile of heavier boxes and or mis-handled.  I was then stupid enough to be talked into ordering a third time using Fed-Ex and guess what, the third case came damaged  again.  The packaging material is not adequate to protect this heavy duty travel case.  How could it survive being checked on a plane, as advertised? The aluminum track, at the point of closer, does not align side to side or up and down, when in the closed position.  I will look elsewhere for a top quality case to protect my expensive guitars.	-1
The handle to this case broke off in a very minor situation.  There is no replacement available for this case either. So for $149 it does protect the instrument however, if the handle breaks, it's a pain to carry around.  So, you might thinks about buying something else.	-1
The capo I received has a shallow and short gripping ability.  It barely fit on my parlor guitar in depth and width and would not fit at all on my Ovation A/E guitar, neither of which has a very deep or wide neck.  Additionally, I found it to be difficult to grasp and open.  I threw it in the trash.	-1
This is supposed to be quick change but it is very hard to open and close. There is no way we can comfortably use this. We are keeping it since we no longer have the package it came in but we went back to our old capo after a few days of trying to get use to this one.	-1
These wedge are ok - typical foam, nothing more dense or detailed as you might expect with $100 foam.  These are glorified egg crate foam pieces cut.  That's all.  I imagine production cost for these is around $10.  And they charge $100.  You do the math.	-1
These Kysers are OK but not really for acoustic so much. You must rely on a spring to made the decisions of how much tension is used. It's not the best science. I bought it for when I play songs and need to switch keys in the middle of the tune. I am a professional entertainer of stage so this a needed. For basic capo needs........ It's great.	-1
Took FOREVER to arrive. Looked great. Then too difficult for my 13 year old son to use.	-1
I am a semi-pro musician.  I play a hybrid finger-style using a flat-pick and steel finger picks.  My primary guitar is a 1982 Taylor 555.  I found these strings to be utterly disappointing. Dull sounding with a very stiff and unresponsive feel.  For "light" gauge strings, they required an awful lot of torque to get them up to concert pitch.  So much so that it raised the action noticeably.  If my Taylor had been strung with these strings when I was shopping for a 12-String, I would have passed this outstanding guitar over.	-1
This is not a very good harmonica. It leaks too much air, making it hard to play, particularly on the draw notes. It's playable, but it's far more work than it should be, and it's difficult to make the notes sound at something approximating equal loudness when some of them want to come out as more of a wheeze than a clear tone. To be fair, the Blues Harp doesn't leak as much as some Chinese harmonicas, such as the Hohner Blues Bands (which leak like screen doors). But other (non-Chinese) harmonicas manage to leak far less - my Seydel Blues Session and Suzuki Promaster leak only slightly, my Lee Oskar doesn't leak at all. Even other German-made Hohners such as the Special 20 leak far less than the Blues Harp.  There are some other peculiarities, such as the reed plates which somewhat inexplicably overhang the front of the comb. They only protrude about twelve thousandths of an inch, or a bit less than 1/64, but it's certainly enough to feel weird. I can handle that, and it's not a fatal flaw, it's just ... weird.  In sum, this is a bizarrely designed and indifferently manufactured harp, and very overpriced for the quality it delivers. A disappointing acquisition.	-1
Too easily bendable, but its works okay	-1
I've actually owed 2 Blues Harps. I wasn't happy with either one. Of the available options, this is one of the poorest quality. Bottom line: It has a wooden comb and it WILL warp with use. Once this happens it will not be airtight anymore so you'll have to blow your head off to play this thing...and...it'll feel like your running your lips and younger over a cheese grater.  This this type of sound in this price range do yourself a favor and get a Special 20.  The Special 20 has a plastic comb that will not warp with moisture. You can only hear the difference of comb material inside your head as you play. It has NO effect on the sound leaving the instrument into the room. Your audience will never hear a wooden comb vs. a plastic comb. The idea that they can is pure mythology--period. So save your mouth some pain and fatigue and get a Special 20.	-1
These are so thin that the pics click a lot.	-1
The price you pay for ordering on line.  Super thin and flimsy.	-1
was ok	-1
----------Hohner Blues Harp: -(**___) overall: This is the one harmonica I own that I don't enjoy playing. The redeeming quality is the Blues Harp sounds very good, enough to compete with any harmonica in its price range. If I had never played other good harmonicas I would have liked it because of its sound and rated it highly. However the metal covers protrude and are sharp on the lips, making it simply too uncomfortable to be any good. There are just too many better alternatives. -(****_) Sound: Excellent. This is the strength of the Blues Harp. Sounds as good as any great harmonica in this price range. -(*____) Comfort: The most uncomfortable harmonica I have played, bad enough that I make sure to stay away. This is a thick harmonica, but the problem is with the coverplates protruding over the wood comb. This means the lips press and slide against two sharp pieces of metal, creating increasing discomfort the longer the harmonica is played. -(**___) Playability: The protruding coverplates make it harder to get a tight seal. The wood comb is not smooth and the holes have sharp edges, so the harmonica does not slide smoothly. The positive note is I didn't have excessive gapping issues with any individual reeds or any being excessively out of tune. -(**___) Durability: Durability is the weakness of Hohner overall, no surprise here. -(***__ Aesthetics): Perfectly average. Looks similar to a marine band. Does not have the appeal of a Suzuki.  -----------Comparison with other mid-price Harmonicas (lowest to highest score) --(**___ overall) Hohner Big River: Nothing memorable. It's perfectly fine but there's no reason to buy it over the Special 20 (the $ savings is minimal). Unlike the Special 20 it has a wood comb, but if you want a wood comb buy a Marine Band. --(***__ overall) Hohner Marine Band 1896 Classic: The longtime favorite of many players, undisputed best for decades and, in my opinion, still the best wood-comb harmonica at the mid-price range. Many pros still use it, but don't be fooled, they are likely to be custom-assembled custom-tuned custom-polished. At mid-price range it has my (slightly) favorite sound, but the Special 20 and Lee Oskar are significantly more comfortable and their holes are easier for a beginner to single out. --(****_ Overall) Hohner Special 20: This and the Lee Oskar are the best in terms of comfort and ease of play. The plastic comb protrudes, making it extremely comfortable and smooth to use. The sound is great. Durability is terrible. The case is more durable than the Lee Oskar one. --(****_ Overall) Lee Oskar Major Diatonic: Excellent harmonica, extremely comfortable, great sound. Just as good as the Special 20. In fact, the two are so similar I struggle to find a meaningful difference. Ultimately I chose the Lee Oskar: It has a better reputation for durability and replaceable reedplates, so at this price range it is my preferred harmonica. One downside is the plastic case can break within a month from normal daily opening/closing.  ---------- High end Harmonicas: --(***** Overall) Suzuki Firebreath, Suzuki Promaster, Suzuki Olive, Seydel Noble: Amazing. All of these are better than the mid-priced harmonicas reviewed above. However they are not cheap, so I recommend the Lee Oskar as a first harmonica until you decide you're going to stick with the instrument. Even if you're "sure" you'll stick, I still recommend starting with the Lee Oskar because beginners are more likely to misuse and break their harmonicas, and so you get the pleasure of looking forward to and appreciating your future upgrade. --(*****The Best*****) Antony Dannecker Optimus (custom harmonica): Simply the best, comes at a price. Antony is great and very available if you want to discuss any particular tweaks to your custom harmonica. Off the shelf can't compare.  ----------Note on the 2-draw: 1-2-star reviews often complain their 2-draw was broken from day one. The 2-draw most likely is not broken, it is simply a very difficult note for beginners to play.  ----------Note on which key to buy first: --Start with a key of C. This is the accepted standard since most beginner songs and lessons will all be in C. One harmonica is fine as a beginner. --Then: A, D, G A is common in blues and country. D is also common. G is often used when playing along with guitar. --Then Bb, F, E,... here is gets more debatable  ---------- If any edit would improve the review quality/thoroughness/clarity write me a comment.	-1

It's perfectly fine but there's no reason to buy it over the Special 20 (the $ savings is minimal). Unlike the Special 20 it has a wood comb, but if you want a wood comb buy a Marine Band. --(***__ overall) Hohner Marine Band 1896 Classic: The longtime favorite of many players, undisputed best for decades and, in my opinion, still the best wood-comb harmonica at the mid-price range. Many pros still use it, but don't be fooled, they are likely to be custom-assembled custom-tuned custom-polished. At mid-price range it has my (slightly) favorite sound, but the Special 20 and Lee Oskar are significantly more comfortable and their holes are easier for a beginner to single out. --(****_ Overall) Hohner Special 20: This and the Lee Oskar are the best in terms of comfort and ease of play. The plastic comb protrudes, making it extremely comfortable and smooth to use. The sound is great. Durability is terrible. The case is more durable than the Lee Oskar one. --(****_ Overall) Lee Oskar Major Diatonic: Excellent harmonica, extremely comfortable, great sound. Just as good as the Special 20. In fact, the two are so similar I struggle to find a meaningful difference. Ultimately I chose the Lee Oskar: It has a better reputation for durability and replaceable reedplates, so at this price range it is my preferred harmonica. One downside is the plastic case can break within a month from normal daily opening/closing.  ---------- High end Harmonicas: --(***** Overall) Suzuki Firebreath, Suzuki Promaster, Suzuki Olive, Seydel Noble: Amazing. All of these are better than the mid-priced harmonicas reviewed above. However they are not cheap, so I recommend the Lee Oskar as a first harmonica until you decide you're going to stick with the instrument. Even if you're "sure" you'll stick, I still recommend starting with the Lee Oskar because beginners are more likely to misuse and break their harmonicas, and so you get the pleasure of looking forward to and appreciating your future upgrade. --(*****The Best*****) Antony Dannecker Optimus (custom harmonica): Simply the best, comes at a price. Antony is great and very available if you want to discuss any particular tweaks to your custom harmonica. Off the shelf can't compare.  ----------Note on the 2-draw: 1-2-star reviews often complain their 2-draw was broken from day one. The 2-draw most likely is not broken, it is simply a very difficult note for beginners to play.  ----------Note on which key to buy first: --Start with a key of C. This is the accepted standard since most beginner songs and lessons will all be in C. One harmonica is fine as a beginner. --Then: A, D, G A is common in blues and country. D is also common. G is often used when playing along with guitar. --Then Bb,  F, E,... here is gets more debatable  ---------- If any edit would improve the review quality/thoroughness/clarity write me a comment.	-1
I wanted a thin, flexible pick for playing my 12-string guitar, but these are a bit too thin, so I bought some .60 mm Dunlop picks and they are just right.	-1
Nice full mellow sound but break easily. Skinny B and E lasted less than two weeks and three gigs on my Guild dreadnought..	-1
Impossibe to actually put on your guitar, since the holes in the leather were almost non-existent.. I ended up needing scissors, a screwdriver, and pliers. Beyond ridiculous, do not buy this strap or this brand.	-1
Material  very scrarchy and irritating.  You need to wear a thick shirt or sweater when wearing this.	-1
Not sure what happened. I've owned these before and found them reasonably functional, at least when considering convenience and cost. BUT this last one had a SOOOO MUCH spring tension that my 11 year old couldn't even use it. The compression on the strings was so extreme that it made the guitar (every guitar) play sharp. It's fine for pkaying solo, but you can't use it for a key change on one instrument and play with another properly tuned instrument (which is kind of the point). I'm also concerned about what it would do to frets after prolonged use. I pretty much limit it's purpose for repair and maintenance work when I need to make adjustments to something but don't want to restring the guitar.  I recommend stearing clear from these entirely.	-1
Great picks.  They have a rough grip that makes them easy to keep hold of with sweaty hands.  I have played with them for over 30 years, and have never broke one.  They don't wear out.  The only reason I bought these was to replace ones that I have lost or given away.	-1
If you always strum and pick perfectly parallel to the strings, always at  the same height, and you always hold you pick exactly the same each time, you might not rip out a finger nail using these minuscule picks. If you like to get crazy and play hard sometimes, you're going to hurt yourself. Once the novelty of the unique sound wore off, I didn't want to take a chance.	-1
Too thin for any guitar.  Not sure what you could use them for, but on ultra light strings they are just like paper, totally useless.	-1
Blow	-1
You cannot adjust the beaters' angles!!! Do not buy this unless you are not a drummer and will never notice. I bought mine at Sam Ash but it's the same model. Save up a little more, especially if you are new to bass pedals.	-1
E string broke with little tension applied so really don't know how they sound. Ordered another brand.	-1
bend to easily make an odd sound	-1
Way to thin to be useful. All I can hear is the clacking of the picks against the strings. Sounds like when we used to put baseball cards in the spokes of our bikes when we were younger.	-1
Not what I expected, can't use them	-1
Not my style for what I play (rock).	-1
I can't hear the sounds of the strings over the flick of these flimsy picks across them. better for electric guitar but still hard to play fast	-1
Not really Dunlop's fault, I bought the thicker (.73 mm) picks and love them.  These .46 mm picks are just way too thin, like paper thin.  I don't know how anybody can play with these.	-1
I had to send this back. Its a great concept but not well thought out. When you put your mic system in it fits snug with the foam pads. If you plan on using the short antennas then you can leave them on the unit. I use the range extension antennas that are longer and they won't fit unless you remove and put on each time you use. The other issue I have with this design is that when you unzip you can't completely remove the ends of the case. So when you are using there really isn't a good way to have it set on table. With a little adjustment on design this would be a really cool simple case to have. Unfortunately it didn't  work for me. I'm a huge fan of Gator products too. Hope this helps!	-1
another item never received but i would not use anything over .88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase.	-1
I was able to get a nice crisp sound from my bass guitar with these picks, but I found the grip uncomfortable.  This made playing with them feel awkward, especially during faster strumming which was somewhat frustrating.  At first I thought that after I used them a bit I'd get used to it, but after playing with them for a while decided that it would be better to find a pick that better suits me rather than try to adapt to these picks.	-1
Unless your microphones are incredibly short, this will not work. The top couldn't begin to close with 4 (wired) Monoprice dynamic vocal mics in it, and they are only 7.5 inches tall.  Because of this we did not get to test its durability--it may well be durable or it may not. But it was not tall enough for me to use with my band.	-1
Dunlop .73 picks are the best picks in the world as far as I'm concerned. At a music store they range from 25 to 40 cents each. The description for this item does not show a quantity. Now that I received it, I find you get a dozen for less than four bucks, which wouldn't be bad, but then with the cost of shipping I ended up paying close to nine bucks for twelve picks. I did not see anywhere in the description of the item where they told how many picks you get, and I was hoping for more.	-1
The whole package of picks was bent.  All picks curve the same way.  You can really notice how much they are bent if you put 2 of these picks together non-graphic side.  I never paid attention to it until now.  Fender thin picks in Red are completely flat.  As a result, if you flip these picks, the feel changes completely.  I guess it's not as bad for simple strumming, but when playing intricate solos, one side of the pick feels completely different from the other side.	-1
It was too small for my Shure microphones!	-1
This will only fit a standard wired microphone (SM-58 or others).  My wireless mics (which is what I bought it for) are too long, and the holes are too small.  I would take the foam out and modify it to my needs, but it is glued and sewn into the bag. I'm not sure what I'll do with the bag, but it won't be holding any microphones unfortunately.	-1
Crappy pick. Feels cheap. Not much better than cutting up a credit card to make a pick. Stick with Fender or Planet Waves.	-1
Case looks nice but is to small for serious protection and the top does not properly protect the mic grille.	-1
They're not bad picks, just not for me.  Too soft and "round" sounding and feeling.  I like a much stiffer pick with a sharp tip, and a much brighter sound.  I play mostly hard rock and metal, your mileage may vary.	-1
The gauge is fine, but should you sweat the lightest bit, you loose all control over the pick.  I've used most everything and these are probably the worst I've used in terms of grip.	-1
While these picks have the body and stiffness I look for, they also have little burrs left from production that need to be filed off before use.  If you don't mind spending some time getting them ready for use, these are good picks.	-1
I didn't like the sound on plastic beaters.. also it's a pain to take off make sure you got goo gone or something...	-1
These picks are extremely flimsy, go for a higher thickness if you wanna play harder.	-1
Looks cool.. but awkward it is upside down compared to the jim dunlop which I find much easier to use	-1
Not a white patch like posted it's actually two clear patches if u want whit u gotta get a diffrent one	-1
Very flimsy but if thats what you're looking for this is great. I prefer a stiff guitar pic	-1
Hands down the worst bass drum patch I've ever owned. I have brand new tama speed cobras, and this patch's rough surface has eaten away the felt on the bass drum beaters. Now I'm out 30 bucks for new beaters. So this patch may be cheap, but don't let it's price fool you because it'll end up costing you in the end. get aquarian or remo instead. I've never had a problem with either like I did with the Evans patch.	-1
hated it, not better that the Remo Palam patches, don't buy this bc they will fall off over time, and its not as durable.	-1
Not much of a guitar pic. Went will cool cat tongue pics and they are much better.	-1
these are OK, but I prefer Snarling Dog	-1
I'm giving this two stars for good reasons. Hear me out.  Jim Dunlop makes ULTEX picks which are immensely better than these. I go through one of these per sitting, at times two.  If ALL you do is strum an accoustic and sing about your dead wife and wine and grits this pick is perfect!  If you ever shred or put any abuse into your playing, you'll be going through more than you can count.	-1
Not a good guitar at all. Hard to hold, hard to play, lost tone in no time. It's only saving grace is that it looks nice. I gave it away after very little use. I went and bought an Ovation acoustic-electric guitar which is much, much better.	-1
I'm 50 and am used to the older material, I don't like nylon. these are a good size but don't have that same flex and feel. Can't get used to them, just me, maybe others. Dunlop seems to be going cheap, unless there is no way to make this have better fit and finish. Better than picking with folded paper.	-1
The high E began buzzing a week after I bought it. Slowly all the high strings began buzzing. I guess the neck warped. It's a great looking guitar though so I just hung it on my wall for looks. I got pissed off one day and smashed it over my computer desk. It splinter wonderfully and made a heck of a sound. Highly recommended if you plan on smashing something. Not so much for making music.	-1
A friend brought over this guitar for me to help him tune the guitar ( since I play guitar for over 20 years and own several guitars ), First thing I check is the neck to see if it is straight, and notice it is slight bend outward, After tuning the guitar 2 to 3 times ( because it slip out of tune quickly), I strum a few chords and it sounded terrible, all the chords I played (C,F,G,Am, D, D7, Dm E Em etc.) all have BUZZ sound, the strings do not have enough clearance to the FRETS, I think this could be the NUT and SADDLE are too high, You can never play a clear note with this condition, also extremely difficult for beginner to learn the basics.	-1
Short length, not Ernie ball brand, knock off product	-1
The product I received was a knock off brand and not an Ernie Ball strap. It even came in an "cose" package	-1
This no bueno	-1
The lubricant on the pad was dry on arrival and not usable. I compared what I received in this order with the same product available off the shelf at the local music store. The pad should have enough lubricant soaked in it that it is visible on your finger when touched or even pressed. Since the manufacturer's packing does not include any seal, just a tin lid as shown it dries out on the retailer's shelf or in the warehouse if not sold soon enough.	-1
Did not work well for us!	-1
Worthless !	-1
Dried out after a week. Kept inside of tin with lid on. I used it once a night for the week and it was dry by the end of the week. Maybe I got a dud. Who knows. Likely will not buy again. Dunlop sells a similar product in a bottle and it has lasted me months and seems to stay on the strings longer.	-1
Way too small. Not a good value. Buy a small pillow and some Velcro instead.	-1
I purchased this item to dampen my 22in bass drum but although well made, it is of such a light construction that it has little to no chance of working correctly. It will most likely work on a smaller type drum like a traveler kit (16in bass) but not a full size kit.	-1
I just don't get why so many people use this capo. In my experience, it is useless.  The spring is so tight, that it's going to pull some of your strings (probably the E,B and G) out of tune, every time you barre a fret with it. If you enjoy re-tuning continually, then you will probably like this capo.  But I suggest you spend a little more and get the Planet Waves Tri-Action Capo. It will save you time and grief. The Tri-Action Capo keeps every string in tune, while giving a great tone, unlike the sharp, harsh tone that the Kyser produces. And yes, you can park it on the head when not in use.  Forget this capo, and invest in the Planet Waves Tri-Action cap.	-1
I am a bit disappointed this product is not made to fit a bass drum of most common lengths as I prefer it to touch BOTH heads to limit overtone ringing. This one was a bit short in length. Be sure to look up its fit dimension before ordering.	-1
I like the product itself, I've bought it many times before in the store and always had a good opinion of it. However when I purchased this on Amazon the item arrived without a factory seal. This caused the item to be in four separate pieces when it arrived to me, the tin can, the tin cap, the brush and the brush cap were all apart in the box. So the product is now dried up and the worst part is that the enclosed cloth was not included. This tells me that before shipping, it was opened and the cloth was removed. The description states that I would be receiving a new, factory sealed product with cloth enclosed... Definitely won't be purchasing this online again.	-1
The handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar, and I feel rushed to clamp on the capo because it's unpleasant to use - hurts the fingers. It's cheap and easy to use. It'll do the job, but I don't like it.	-1
I recently bought a few packs of Jazz IIIs and I was shocked.  They don't play at all like what I was expecting.  Under high magnification the edge doesn't look the same as the old Jazz III either, and they don't play the same if you turn them over!!!  What's up with that?  I'm sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like Dunlop.  Let's hope this is just a short-term fluke.	-1
I've been playing guitar for over 40 years, and these Tortex picks are nearly the worst I'v ever used.  They are so noisy that they overpower the guitar strings with their clackity-clack noise.  Dunlop Ultex picks sound much better.	-1
I bought one of these in July of 2013.  I had a black one that I have owned for over 10 years and works great.  This one, the spring doesn't keep the string down snug enough to prevent buzzing.  A complete waste of money.  I am going to buy one of these in the future...http://smile.amazon.com/G7th-Performance-Capo-String-Silver/dp/B0007GGUGA/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&ie=UTF8&qid=1447375034&sr=1-1&keywords=g7%20capo%20for%20acoustic%20guitar My friend who is a professional highly recommends the one above.	-1
Cheap price not very comfortable, was pretty secure thought	-1
Fit my fat fingers quite nicely, though it is a bit heavier than expected (it's brass, duh). The sound it produces is very good for the studio, but for every day play I'll stick with the small & light one for my pinkie.	-1
There was no plastic cap and no cloth, and the metal cap had opened in the box and it had lost most of its oils	-1
I purchased this Dunlop model 224 Heavy wall brass slide, size medium, at the same time as ordering the Dunlop "Moonshine" model 243 slide also size medium...NEITHER of these Two slides are a Medium size. I have slides from many makers that fit my Pinky perfectly and they are size Medium. I now own TWO USELESS Dunlop slides...How two size "mediums" from the same maker can be different is totally RIDICULOUS and a lousy business practice. Buy Rock Slide for the best or Imperial Valley.... I'm Disgusted	-1
Don't Bother with it.  Way too expensive and has many disadvantages over a powered mixer.  I was using it to get a couple more inputs for a Boss RC-300 looper.  I was hoping I could get away with one less power cord.  However, the signal loss is very significant.  Also the volume and signal loss of the other channels are effected by turning up and down the sliders.  In other words, you lose power left and right and every which way between.  It was practically impossible to find a good setting on it.	-1
This is a wonderful product JUST BE CAREFUL  not to purchase from Brook Mays, my order never arrived and after waiting an extra 6 weeks hoping that my order arrived the said that a month had already passed. so I never got my product and they have nothing to do with that now. So great product but be aware who you purchase from. The product gets 5 stars but Brook Mays gets 0 out of 5 stars.	-1
Don't waste your money here; cheap feel	-1
I got an Ernie Ball strap in red for my Epiphone SG. Seems like a great deal for the price. The ends are real leather, which is the reason I bought it. The slits in the leather fit tautly over the guitar's strap buttons. The nylon has some sort of depth to the weave, producing decent friction against my clothing. This is really useful, as SG's are known to be neck heavy, and it can prevent neck dive (where the guitar neck wants to fall down), which can result in a broken tuners or other unpleasantness. Highly recommend! Remember, if you get a strap, get strap locks! I like the guitar savers rubber locks.  ------- Update about a year later. Downgraded my rating to 2 stars. For a few more dollars you can get full leather straps. I fell out of love with this strap because the part where the leather met the nylon was a bit rough and scuffed the finish on my guitar right around the strap button. Not major, but good suede or leather wouldn't have done that.	-1
Can't recommend these strings at all.  I used to play these and liked the sound enough, but they break quickly.  Never while playing but they'd unravel overnight over the fingerboard, and that's never happened with any other string.  The last straw was when I changed the strings, played literally one night, opened the case the next day and the D and A had both unraveled.  I play Pirastro Tonicas now, they have a darker tone that I like more, and they have never broken on me.	-1
I never come the product to my hands. I do not have information of the product, which I spend with the order?	-1
For the price, it's better than not having a strap at all; but when all things are considered, it's probably the worst strap I've ever used. The material is rigid and rough, it's very uncomfortable and very cheaply made. I would not expect it to last very long. Prolonged use would undoubtedly leave the guitarist with an aching shoulder. The strap is also very short, so anyone who likes to play with their guitar low will definitely dislike this strap. Most importantly, though, the holes for the guitar pegs are way too small. So unless your guitar has locking tuners or unnaturally small strap pegs, this will NOT work for your guitar. Overall this is another very disappointing product from Ernie Ball. After several years of playing guitar I can't understand why they are considered to be "name brand." Ernie Ball strings are poorly made and break regularly. The Ernie Ball wah effect pedal is also mediocre. I was hoping to redeem the company for myself by trying out their line of straps, but it was evidently a waste. Nobody should have to pay more than $20 for a decent, quality strap, but this strap definitely does not make the cut. Again, a bad strap is better than none at all, but do yourselves a favor if you are looking at buying this strap and spend a little bit more for a different brand.	-1
Learning the guitar is expensive and this is one lesson. The odor is bad. So bad I can not take it. Change the strings, Don't mess with this junk. Its not just the odor. I do not want anything this string close to my eyes. I was hunting for a solution to sweat and sticky. It helped the sticky thing some but created more problems that it helped.	-1
Cheap. No grip to them at all. Spend a little more for a better strap.	-1
These picks slip out of my fingers to easy... They're just too smooth I guess. My Dunlop picks are much easier to keep gripped.	-1
This product is not what it seems. It has a cool name, but that's about it. It's a tool oil that stinks. I tried my best to get use to this product, but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. After doing away with the Fast-Fret, my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. I now use Old English and my guitars thank me, my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. You will too...	-1
TOO SMALL, LIKE STUFFING A TURKEY.	-1
really too fat and clumsy to use ... you will probably go back to metal brushes...	-1
Strap is not good..... Bought two for my basses and quickly noticed how cheap they are. Very cheap and hard material. It is very rough on the shoulders so I tried to get pads for them but they did not help.... Slips off shoulders during performance which is very frustrating. I guess its true what they say..." You get what you pay for".	-1
Update: Just up and died. I have no idea why. Nothing bad happened to it. It made it through several gigs and then one day, nothing. It was great while it lasted.  What do you expect from Furman besides rock solid reliability when it comes to your power? This is an essential part of my gig bag now. The cable is very generous and can always get power to my rig from anywhere in the clubs that I play. Even if they only have one outlet on stage and the guitar player needs it for all his pedals. I haven't had a chance to test how it handles power problems but so far I haven't had any issues to speak of. (Correction, see Update)  It is SOLID. Well worth the money. This is a no brainer. Every gigging musician should have one in their kit.	-1
The strap is rough and uncomfortable against the skin when worn for long periods of time. The edges of the strap are not smooth and start cutting into the skin.	-1
I bought my guitar used (like new), and the strings it had on it were fantastic. Very easy to play, and made the guitar sound fantastic. I switched to these when the strings were getting worn, and they initially sounded good, but the next day it just came across as muddy. Not to mention, it was like it lost its action; It no longer had any of the playability I bought the guitar for. I'll have to call and see what he was using, but for now I have 3 different types of strings on the way, so hopefully one will bring the guitar back. They sound ok I guess, but I won't be using these again.  Should mention the 0-12 VS is a slot head, so maybe that had something to do with it. Hope that helps someone.	-1
worst experience ever!!!!!	-1
When I put a reed on the mouthpiece that came with this set, you cannot put the cap over the mouthpiece.  won't at that point go on the ligature.  I need some help.  This just isn't right.  I've played alto sax for years and I don't understand this.	-1
Cannot use with more than three AC adapters (e.g. 9 volt "wall warts" for effects pedals). Poor design. They should have either spaced the outlets more or oriented the rows of three in opposing directions).	-1
I heartily recommend *against* purchasing these strings.  Immediately after putting these on my guitar, I was _unimpressed_.  The tension seems less than others (for example:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Elixir-Light-Nanoweb-80-20-Bronze-Acoustic-Guitar-Strings/dp/B0002E1O2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Elixir Light Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/D-Addario-EJ16-3D-Phosphor-Bronze-Acoustic-Guitar-Strings-3-Sets-Light/dp/B000OR2RNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">D'Addario EJ16-3D Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, 3 Sets, Light</a>), and they rattled as if to agree with what my left hand felt in the tension.  To both hands, the strings felt slightly tacky.  Played fingerstyle, they sound dull, or muted, especially on the low end.  When played with a slide, they sound noisy, as if my left hand muting isn't working all of a sudden.  That was just the first day!  I hoped they would improve, but they did not.  They continued to sound dull, especially played fingerstyle, as if they were really old.  In fact, that's it, in a nutshell: these strings feel and sound as if they'd been strung on a guitar gathering dust and oxidizing for a year; yet they were brand new.  Ultimately, the high E broke, (other reviewers have mentioned strings breaking too).  In the spirit of complete disclosure, I switch tunings a lot (DADGAD, open D & G, standard) and of course this will shorten the life of strings.  But still: these lasted less than 2 weeks.  It's fun to experiment, but these strings were so disappointing that I'm glad a string broke, to entice me to rid the guitar of them sooner!  For now it's back to D'Addarios; they are excellent sounding and value.	-1
Sounded nice, but quite a few snapped on me. Don't last as long as some other brands I have used.	-1
EDIT:  3/14/2013  All good things must come to an end.  Kyser no longer donates money to the Komen foundation, the lifetime warranty has been shortened to a 1 year warranty, Kyser's latest products do not say, "Made in USA" on them, and all that good mojo has pretty much been sold up the river trying to squeeze a couple more pennies out of their customers...  For about eleven dollars LESS, you can buy a high quality Kyser knock-off, right here on Amazon, and put the extra money into your own pocket instead of into the hands of some greedy MBA types who ruined what used to be a great American product.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  For every pink capo sold, Kyser donates a dollar to the Susan G. Komen foundation.  Also, Kyser capos are made in the USA by Americans.  A good product, a good cause, a good company, and good mojo...  And what better way to impress the ladies!?  ;-)  Charity starts at HOME!	-1
One of the sockets broke the second time I used it.	-1
Very light weight, not very satisfying feel on the guitar. The hole in the very thin attachment points wears quickly, causing concern that the guitar might come loose. But it is easy to adjust if that matters to you.	-1
I was reading the reviews before I bought this. People are really happy with them. I am not. 1) The process of putting them on.   The tape has 2 sides. One with a rubbery texture (I would assume that goes on the outside of the stick) and the other a paper  like texture( no friction). I was not sure which side goes against the stick so I tried both ways. The paper side kept on sliding off while I was wrapping the stick. It was frustrating and I did not finish putting them on. I am pretty sure this was the inted way for the tape to be orientated. I flipped the tape over and tried the rubber side down. Sure it was easy to apply, but why would I want the paper part against my hands.  2) Imperfections   while wrapping the tape at an angle there were some parts where the tape would rise and create a lip, instead of being flat. This is probably because it is a wide piece of tape and the materials do not really conform to the body of the stick. When I found an angle to avoid this, the taper overlapped itself to much and there was not enough tape to get half way up the stick.  3) Materials   The rubber side of the tape does not feel that great. If you disregard everything I said, listen to this. I bought my 2nd pair of ahead aluminum sticks. One of the best investments I've made in my drumming career. On my first pair I used the VATER Grip Tape. It was great. Felt great. Maybe I was spoiled by getting a better prodict to begin with. But the fact remains, There is a better product out there. For sticks and tape I got a good 6 or 7 months out of I would spend the extra bucks on it.    Ahead sticks are great! Ahead grip tape is not.	-1
if you are a dj or musician and drop it or rough hande it, the internal wiring to the sockets are only pressed in spring loaded, not screwed in or soldered, they will fall out or make a weak connection, internally cheap construction	-1
Basically, it's a cheap plastic strap, probably strong, but very slippery.  My neck-heavy Hofner bass points at seven o'clock the second I let go of the neck.  A lighter instrument with more neutral balance might like it better.  I added a suede strap pad from an old suitcase, which helped a little, but I'm sticking this in the case for a backup, and finding something with adequate quality and a nonskid under side.	-1
while i do love the cheaper vandoren reeds, and maybe it is this box, these reeds are awful..fuzzy sounding...with the cheaper reeds, i get a rich full sound...with these...my sound is like a tire going flat...ugh...	-1
Doesn't stay clamped very well. It would be better with a screw clamp.	-1
Worst Amazon experience ever.  The product itself -- a portable battery operated amp which is indeed legendary and which I have owned and loved in the past -- is now apparently being manufactured by a cut rate outfit -- lots of cheap plastic parts, badly assembled that tend to fall apart.  It took three tries before I got one that held up after one use.  Just as cheap was the customer service from Amazon.  The return procedure from this item was not set up properly and it seemed impossible for customer service to manually override, so that I could return the defective merchandise.  Resolving the issue took six contacts. Eventually I was promised small credits and upgraded shipping for my troubles, but none of that came to pass either.  If you must buy this product (it's kind of a unique item) I strongly recommend you get it at Sam Ash or Guitar Center and test drive it to make sure your not getting a lemon.	-1
This drumstick holder is just ok.....not great but not bad. It's really not strong enough to clamp on and stay on. You have to pull the sticks straight out because if not it pulls the clamp off the stand. My opinion, go ahead and spend a little more and get a stick bag w wide opening	-1
Cheaply made.  Returned.  Will not be buying an Ernie Ball strap again.  Check out Fender's $10 strap on Amazon.  That is a good low end strap.  Durable and I love the Fender logo on it.  Cheers.	-1
I've had one of these stick holders for 20 years.  Part of the clip finally broke off, so I ordered a new one.  The old one still works fine, and I plan to put the new one in the "main" position under the hi-hat, and the old one attached to a cymbal stand on my right side.  Now I can have an extra pair of sticks on both sides and never worry about fumbling after a dropped stick again!!  Update: I initially gave this a 5-star review based upon the fact that the old one I had stood up to 20 years of use before it broke. I got the replacement months ago and after using it for a while I had to drop the review down to a 1-star review based upon the fact that the clamp is nowhere near as strong on this one as it was on the earlier version. Just brushing against the sticks in the holder can cause the whole thing to pop off of the stand and go flying.  I will definitely have to order a different stick holder and use this one as a backup or even just toss it.  It isn't worth the price.	-1
It is literally just a very small sponge (like the ones you buy at the grocery store for less than a dollar each) in a plastic holder. I feel like $8 is WAY too much to charge for something that costs pennies. Plus, worst of all, IT DIDNT WORK!! I kept a humidity meter in my guitar case and measured for a week making sure the sponge was always wet and the humidity in the guitar never changed. At least not on the meter.	-1
Kinda cheap. one of the tabs broke soon after purchase. Didn't like to have to loosen strings just to get in in place. There are better products out there.	-1
I own a few and have a hard time remembering to "refill" the sponge. I'm better off just humidifing the room	-1
Does nothing but dries up quickly	-1
I realize this is apparently a very popular head. I've been playing over 51 years and have had a l-o-t of snare drums and heads, especially in the past 10 years. I tried this on two DW snares and, soundwise, I might as well have been playing a cardboard box. Not much better on my DrumCraft. I realize lots of people are into near-field micing where you don't really hear, want to hear or need to hear the same as acoustic playing. But I won't buy another of these. After much effort to try to like it, including removing the muffle ring, I cut mine up to use the mylar for other purposes.	-1
I have a previous version of this humidifier from Planet Waves, and I'm confused.  Compared to the competition, even the "old" design was only marginally effective; the sponge inside that holds the moisture was barely big enough to do the job.  Now, rather than slightly raise the price (which I'd rather pay for a unit that's gonna work), they SHRINK the size of the absorbent media.  In the case of candy bars, all you get is less for your money.  In the case of a guitar humidifier, you get a product that WILL NOT protect your investment (aka: your guitar).  I recommend NOT wasting time on this unit.  There are other units that your guitar would celebrate as a veritable "oasis" of moisture.	-1
the lit rocker switch is poorly position, VERY easy to hit and thereby shutting off all power when plugging in near the switch. The switch is also easy to trip; almost no finger pressure needed to turn off the unit. Furman makes pro level stuff and IMO items like this one tends to cheapen the Furman reputation	-1
I don't like the way it spreads the strings and pops up when you open the case. And, it dries out way too quickly. I have resumed using the "stone" type of humidifier. My luthier, who recommended trying this type of humidifier, has also gone back to the old style.	-1
Dont bother!	-1
This part does does not fit my 2008 Gibson Robot Les Paul Studio Silverburst Ltd Ed.	-1
