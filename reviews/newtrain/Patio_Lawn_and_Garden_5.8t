We have a tremendous squirrel problem and used Wild Bills for many years until the squirrels started knocking them down and broke 2 of them. This feeder, bolted on a pole, does keep them off. I have seen a couple gyrating up the pole and managing to get seed off the tray. but this doesn't seem to be the rule. So cautiously I give this a great rating.	1
The bird feeder is squirrel proof. The squirrels found the new feeder before the birds. However, the squirrels did not have access to the seed. I almost felt sorry for their frustration.	1
works great	1
Really like this feeder, although did not like the small pole and it wobbled.  Mounted feeder on a sturdy pipe and set in cement.  Good service.	1
We really like this feeder. It took a while for the birds to start using it, but now they love it. And the squirrels don't even try to get at it. It's cute to watch a line of little birds eating from this feeder. We did find the pole a bit wobbly so we put a pipe inside the pole - worked great.  Keeps the seeds dry from the rain and dew.	1
Works as described	1
Birds enjoy it & Squirrels cannot defeat it.	1
I do love this one. The squirrel can sit on the roof and reach down and get a few nuts to eat so in order for it to be completely squirrel "proof", one needs to hang it far enough away from any surrounding branches to stop the squirrel from leaping to the roof. That, or put it on the pole provided. Very good value and I like this one the best because it is double sided feeding unlike the Absolute 1. It arrived timely and in great condition. Well packed.	1
Seems well-made.  My only complaint is the multi-part pole that comes with it--had to epoxy the sections together to make it stable, and it's not long enough to mount the way they provide.  I wouldn't use the included PVC pipe to mount the pole in the ground; instead find a pipe that fits inside the pole and pound it into the ground (then slide the pole over the pipe).	1
It's  doing the job..our. squirrels are pissed!	1
Best squirrel resistant feeder yet. Holding a lot of feed will be an asset in the snowy Northeast winter. Pole came with it but it wasn't as high as we wanted so we bought an extra pole kit and used a couple of pieces to go higher.	1
Protects the bird seed from pigeons and other large birds, allows me to cater to the songbirds I enjoy having in my yard.	1
The pole mount seems too short once you bury a portion into the ground. Had to buy an extra to raise it up to a more standard height. Feeder seems like good quality though.	1
So far so good.  I have had this in use for almost a year and even though the squirrels try to get to the food they can't succeed......	1
MADE IN THE U.S.A. !!!! That should be all it would have to say for me to buy this feeder, but it has so many other qualities I can't quit here. I have had one of these feeders for 13 years and it is finally time to buy a new one. The South FL. Sun and Salt air has finally rusted the bottom out. I am buying a new one and not having any issues with the price of this quality feeder. I think I more than got my monies worth from the old one. As a matter of fact I had my wife buy the last one for my Birthday and she paid more for it back then. I can remember her questioning the price and saying, "If that's what you want I'll get it for you"! Although not much is totally squirrel proof this unit comes close as any out there.  I like to Vasaline the pole for extra amusement and most squirrels will give up after a couple of days of defeat. Boy they get mad at that pole and chatter all kinds of thing to it before the leave in a huff.  Thanks for continuing to create a great product.	1
This is a well-designed, attractive feeder that does what it promises: feeds the birds, but not the squirrels.  I stupidly forgot to bring in the feeder one night not long after I bought it, and it got trashed by a bear.  But I got out my rubber mallet, pounded it back into shape, made a couple of repairs and added some reinforcements.  The side coil mechanisms that control the weight at which the bunkers close were undamaged in the onslaught, so it still works, even if it isn't quite as pretty as it was pre-bruin.  I would definitely buy this feeder again (and will have to, if my memory doesn't improve).	1
We have 2 of these now and have ordered one for a dear friend, loved watching the squirrels trying to get into it until one finally figured out how to hang by one toenail and curve around upside down to rob the feeder.  We have hung them with a rope, swinging from a limb now where they have not been able to even get on it.  It is still fun to watch them try.	1
What a great feeder.	1
my birds love this	1
Awesome bird feeder, especially if you hate feeding squirrels too much!	1
The vendor delivered the feeder very promptly, and in perfect condition.  The feeder has worked flawlessly, and as advertised; we have had no problems with either squirrels or raccoons since installing it. It has my unconditional recommendation.	1
Good quality metal - I imagine the kind you make a John Deere tractor with. The roof has a pretty secure hitch on it. I have my bird feeding station about six feet from a public sidewalk and sadly my husband thoughtfully built stairs up my hillside yard for mischief makers to more  easily  access mischief. I had one bird feeder stolen. When I saw the quality of this one, I thought "Gee, this is one I might steal if I were a bird feeder thief!" So, my son, who fills my feeder brought a small lock and chain to secure it to the roofed platform it sits on. Birds took to it immediately. City birds in Northern CA are just a bunch of house wrens and occasional chickadees - not like Texas. I do have two doves who have decided they are not exclusively ground feeders, and they perch on the platform and run the smaller birds off.	1
It took the birds 2 month to get used to this new thing in my yard but now I have 4 Cardinals feeding on it.	1
After the doves ate through 9 pounds of black oil sunflower seed in just one day, I'm buying a second Absolute II squirrel proof bird feeder so the smaller birds can eat their sunflower seed in peace. Thank God, the doves are too stupid to coordinate the perch on this feeder & yes, they will get to keep their regular hooper feeder, but now, it will now be filled with a cheaper bird seed. Update #1 The smarter doves can balance with one foot on the bar & one foot on the feeder, for thankfully, just a short time. One female squirrel can hang from the tree by her rear feet, swing over & grab one seed at a time, I allow this just because the adaptive behavior is so amazing to watch, it deserves reward. There is a baby raccoon who tries to outwit & break into the feeder, but so far, he is unsuccessful. The smaller birds still have to put up with the stupid doves, so if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. Update #2. The raccoons were able to unhook the hanger to both of the feeders crashing them to the ground. I am now at a loss of what to do next. Last night, I watched with a flashlight as the raccoons preformed their gymnastics, it was a irregular gathering of the raccoon family, several deer & a lone skunk. Papa raccoon beat the heck out of the piata until the candy to flew everywhere to the joy of the opportunistic gathering, had there not been a skunk present, I would've gone out to protest. Raccoons 2, Human 0.	1
The product is very well made and sturdy. Squirrels have not been able to get at the seeds and all birds have had no problem with feeding.	1
I have bought these feeders before and they are durable and work great. They have a large seed capacity and can be hung or placed on the enclosed pole. The squirrels are disappointed but the birds love it. You will not be disappointed.	1
I really like this feeder.  It holds a lot of see, which it protects from the elements, you can set the weight bar to keep heavier birds and squirrels from eating all your seed, and the lid locks open, which is a huge plus when filling it.  I have been very pleased with it so far, though my birds have yet to figure out that the new feeder is full of seed.  Some have caught on, but the others are slow.  I'm hoping that with time, it will become more popular.	1
I've had a few squirrel proof feeders.  For example, the Wild Bills feeder, when provides a mild electric shock to squirrels.  Invariably, any feeder that relies on electronics, motors, etc, will fail out in the elements (I live in NJ).  When I had the Wild Bill's feeder, I spent money to keep it going (new circuit board, replacement perches).  The design of this one allows one to set a mechanical counterweight to allow different sized birds to feed.  I set it so that even relatively heavy birds can feed, but it prevents squirrels from scattering the seed.  I have two - the older one is still going and has lasted 5 years.	1
I had actually ordered the "Heritage Farms Bird's Choice Squirrel Proof Bird Feeder" which is a single-side feeder and not a double-side feeder such as this one.  I upgraded to this feeder for two reasons:  1) I had to return two feeders to Amazon because they arrived with broken parts; and 2) the tensioner springs are designed that even on the lightest setting, heavier birds could feed from this feeder.  I would dare say that on the heaviest tension setting, even a small squirrel might get in! Thank you Amazon for your great customer service and return policy where I got a better product!! This feeder came to me intact and the tensioner springs work MUCH BETTER than the single-side feeder from Heritage Farms.  I find the birds really flock to this feeder because they can 'hit' both sides of this feeder.  I have noticed it is sturdier in construction than the single-side feeder previously described.  The tensioner springs work much better in selecting what types of birds you want to feed.  The setting between light and heavy tension settings are definitely noticeable. NOTE: Even though both feeders are sold by Heritage Farms, the "Heritage Farms Bird's Choice Squirrel Proof Bird Feeder" (single-side feeder) is made in China; the "Heritage Farms Absolute II Squirrel Proof Bird Feeder" (double-side feeder) is made in the USA (you will also see this on the Amazon site where you look at the bottom under 'Product Details - Origin').  Go to Heritage Farm's website and you will actually see the "Made in USA"  for this feeder but not the other.  This may explain why I found this bird feeder to be superior in quality and setting the spring tensioners.  Buy this one and you really can't go wrong for being able to serve your many feathered friends (cardinals, titmice, chickadees, nuthatches) and able to keep the larger birds (grackels, blue jays, pigeons) and squirrels out.	1
Squirrels have been defeated! They have tried and they failed. It is an ongoing battle that I intend to win. This bad boy works.	1
5-2-2013.  I have used this type of bird feeder for eight years and it has performed flawlessly. I now bought another for a family member. The feeder has two sides and can dispense a lot of feed, if you want.  I used a piece of plastic and aluminum tape to block off one side and a few of the feeding slots on the other side to reduce the flow of bird seed. Install the blocking  adpation on the insife of the feeder. I have the feeder mounted on a six foot pole in our yard so we can view the birds easily. The feeder has spring-loaded doors that will close if large birds or squirrels attempt to eat the food. The door is spring-loaded and has several pressure settings so it can be adjusted to the types of birds you want to feed from it. I adjusted it to exclude large birds (crows, blackbirds, etc.) but cardinals and blue jays are able to use it easily.  It comes with a 1" thin metal pole (four sections) and an adapter with screws that attach to the bottom of the feeder, if you want to use that. I found the steel pole so flimsy that I purchased a 1.5" diameter plastic water pipe 10' section from Home Depot and installed that in the ground after cutting the pipe to a 7' length (burying one foot deep into the ground). You can use the pipe adapter and shim it for instertion into the plastic pipe to create a very sturdy pole that will withstand any weather. For the new one I purchased the "Birds choice Mounting Flange For 1" Pole by Birds Choice" from amazon.com. It requires some shimming and drilling screw hole into the bottom of the feeder to mount, but it fits the plastic pipe better, especially if you use a 1.5" to 1.25" plastic water pipe reduction adapter fitting, also available at Home Depot.  My first pole setup has lasted perfectly for eight years, but I like the newer idea better.	1
The feeder has less capacity than it seemed and is not completely squirrel proof.  It is sturdy, attractive, and better than most at keeping pests at bay.  The birds seem to like it better than the feeder it replaced.  I plan to buy one more for the front yard.	1
I worked for Wild Birds Unlimited for five years. Prior to working there I purchased this feeder. I had it for a total of about fifteen years (then I moved out of state). I have tried just about every feeder on the market. When I lived in IL, I had all types of birds....and a whole lot of Gray Squirrels. These guys are far more aggressive than Fox Squirrels, and will stop at nothing to get to a food source. I had 16 feeders in my yard (a drawback of working for a wild bird store, to be sure!), and every kind of "squirrel proof" (read as squirrel *resistant*...most of the time....!) feeder and baffle made on the market. This one fit the bill. I did have one incident where a squirrel outwitted the weight system by wrapping itself around the feeder so as to avoid hitting the perch (there are now so many of these kinds, they have figured them out). Even so, he still didn't get much food that way. By far the best bang for your buck. Holds up in all kinds of weather. I used shelled seed, and it stayed dry in the snowiest/rainiest/most humid times. Never rusted. Be sure to get this one, which has two (2) perches. Their other version only has one (1) perch. The manufacturer stands by their product. Parts can be obtained through a local Wild Birds Unlimited or possibly through a local nature store that sells this. Or you can call the manufacturer directly. Amazon's price is the best I have seen anywhere for this feeder (at least as of this moment!).  Feeders on poles should be no more than 3' from a window (to help avoid window strikes), or otherwise as far back in the yard as possible. It's always good to put a feeder on a pole 10' away from anything (and I mean anything!) that a squirrel can jump from. If you use a type of feeder on a pole other than this one (which does not need  a baffle), the best kind of pole baffle is a metal cylinder squirrel baffle (or the longer raccoon cylinder baffle, if they are a problem); they work wonders....as long as the top of it is at least 5' up (so a squirrel can't jump up over the top of it). The best cylinder baffles and pole systems are from Wild Birds Unlimited....they are fabulous! You can order them online from WBU. More expensive, but worth the money. And by the way, if you hang a feeder from a tree, use the Arundale Mandarin baffle (sold here on Amazon). It's the best. If you live where you have ice in the winter, though, you want to be sure to scrape the ice off of it; otherwise the squirrels will get traction on it and be able to get to the feeder underneath.  And always keep those feeders CLEAN and the food FRESH (especially in damp/wet/humid conditions). Nyjer (aka "thistle") seed - for the Goldfinches, etc. - should be changed about every 2 - 3 weeks, sometimes sooner depending upon conditions. Disease is easily spread by dirty feeders/contaminated seed.  And that, my fellow Amazon bird watchers, is my two cents for the day!	1
I was at the end of my rope trying to beat the squirrels. I was almost ready to give up feeding the birds when I purchased this feeder. It is really squirrel proof for me. I hang mine from a large pole. Holds a big supply of food. I did attach some small clamps to the handle on the inside of feeder. The handle was only held in place using tension. The clamps make sure that the handle cannot pop out. Not a big deal, and the small clamps were inexpensive,	1
Face the facts, people: NO bird feeder is "Squirrel Proof," but this one, mounted on a pole, with a baffle, away from shrubs or trees they can jump from and by spraying Pam on the pole you can get to about 85% and that's as good as it gets! Unless you get an extra pole, to make it a lot taller, it will not be deer-proof, but that's another story. A great thing about this feeder is it never rusts, breaks or even needs to be cleaned. It's nice looking, too. I only need to get another because a giant tree branch fell on mine during Hurricane Sandy & knocked it out. This is the best feeder by far & totally worth the cost.	1
I have had this out now for several weeks, and it works just as designed. The smaller & medium birds which here which are currently mostly cardinals, titmice, sparrows, chicakdees, juncos, and wrens are all able to feed in peace. The bluejays & grackles which used to use their beaks to rake all the seed out onto the ground are no longer able to get on the feeder! They quickly learned that it closed when they perched on the rail. I have it on the medium setting. Large capacity- I've only had to re-fill it once, and it is under heavy use. At any given time there are from 2-15 birds! The doves eat anything spilled on the ground as do the juncos. I have it hanging, so cannot speak to the pole-mount that comes with it, but it appears to be a sturdy system if anchored in the ground as directed. And the seed stays dry too. Very happy with this product!	1
I really liked it.  Easy bird weight adjustments.  The top locks up into place when you fill it.  Comes off the pole for easy filling.  5# of seed lasts.  The pole is a little chinsie, five pieces for shipping size, not sturdiness.  Good top cover lock down also. I am adding this after 6 years. What a studly feeder. It isn't even showing it's age. It it ever give out we will buy another just like it. It is in it's third home. We have a mountain bebind us. I drilled a hole in a stump and stuck it in that. It is not uncommon to have three dozen birds waiting to feed. The hopper is so large it takes more than a week for them to empty it. We ars buying a $325 camera system so we can record and id the birds on our TV. The bigest problem is,we had to install screens on the Windows because the birds were so numerous the were killing themselves hitting the windows.	1
When I told my father-in-law about the issues I was having with other bird feeder designs, he surprised me by sending me this feeder as a gift. I've only been using it for a couple of weeks, but already I think the feeder is a winner. I've been luckier than some here because my local squirrels are not as nimble as theirs. While I've watched them jump on top of the feeder and try to gain access to the nutty goodness within, they've been unable to figure out the secret. On more than one occasion, I've seen them try to reach down to the landing bars, and either immediately fall to the ground, or hang on, but be thwarted by the metal gate that lowers due to their weight.  I did have some slight issues when a couple squirrels learned that they could reach the feeder by clinging to a nearby tree branch, but I pruned the branch off, and it's no longer an issue. Picking the right location for the feeder may be the key to keeping the squirrels from raiding it.  Installation was easy. I bought a little fast drying concrete mix, and buried the enclosed PVC sleeve into it, and had the feeder up and operational within a few hours. The capacity of the feeder is huge, meaning I don't need to refill it more than once a week, despite the fact that I live near a nature preserve, and have hundreds of birds visiting. The squirrel baffle/landing bar mechanism allows for three sensitivity settings, and I chose the middle one, allowing all but the heaviest birds access. This means that cardinals and blue jays visit my feeder where before, there were relegated to feeding off of the seed that other birds dropped.  I couldn't be more pleased with this feeder, and I'm considering purchasing a second unit to put in another part of my yard.  UPDATE: 2/9/2011 --- Well, it's been a month or two, and some of the squirrels in my yard HAVE figured out a way to raid this bird feeder. They somehow manage to hang from the side, and lean onto the feeder bar without triggering the bar to lower it, and they can steal the bird seed. However, they can't steal very much, at least so far. From what I've observed, they only manage to get a small handful (one or two sunflower seeds) at a time, and then they have to jump to the ground or a nearby fence to eat their ill gotten booty. Considering this, I still give high marks to the feeder, since they barely make a dent in the huge quantity of feed it holds. If it really bothered me, I might consider filling the feeder with&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Safflower-Seed-25-Lbs/dp/B000QFQA2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Safflower Seed, 25 Lbs</a>, since the squirrels don't like it.	1
When we bought this feeder, we were delighted, as it holds so much bird seed and the birds love it.  So did the squirrels and they did acrobats to get to the feed.  It was quite comical.  We decided to hang this down on a wired line between two trees over our rose garden.  The squirrels have a fit.  Try as they might, they cannot walk that tiny wire.  They have even climbed up the thorny rose bushes trying to get the feed.  This is a very sturdy feeder.	1
This bird feeder does what it says--it keeps the squirrels out.  But there are two drawbacks.  The first is the plastic flange you're supposed to use on a pole mount.  It's way too flimsy to hold up for very long, especially with the weight of the seed when the feeder is full.  I replaced it with a metal flange, and also had to buy longer flat-end screws and nuts to accomodate the new flange.  The second is there is no lip on the little shelf where the birds get the seed, so a lot goes on the ground, especially with finches because they like to throw seed around.  I fill the feeder with black-oil sunflower seed, so it's not because they prefer one food over another.  That being said, I do like this feeder because our sqirrels haven't figured out how to get at the seed yet.  With my old feeder, they'd empty it in a day or two.  Other birds clean up the seed on the ground (along with the squirrels, who get a small snack)so I suppose there's not much waste.	1
This feeder is excellent at keeping the squirrels out(and I have tons of them in the yard) but at first the birds also would not use it. When they tried it seemed that they could not get there footing on the perch. My husband attached a wooden rod to the existing perch and now they LOVE it. The metal perch seem to be to big for the birds to get a hold on. That is the reason for the 4 stars. I think if the perch came wooden I would give this product 5 stars. 9/2010	1
I am so glad I bought this feeder!  We mounted it on the pole that came with it and within a day the squirrels were entertaining us with their antics.  The bird feeder has weight-sensitive perches that close off the seed supply if a heavy bird or animal try to sit on it or, in the case of the squirrels, grab it from below or climb down on it from above.  I have it set to the lightest weight.  The squirrels climb the pole and reach for the perch, only to have the feed door slam down.  They can scrounge a few little seeds but they can't break open the feeder and gorge themselves.  It is so fun to watch them trying to figure out a way to get in!  (They can see the seed through the glass).  They try holding on with one paw and scratching at the glass, they try sitting on top and reaching down, and they try to sneak their heads up under the perch.  No go.  But good for a lot of laughs.  The smaller birds feed easily.  The big birds and squirrels clean up the ground.  Finally, I love that this feeder holds so much seed at once.  Nice feeder, lots of fun for everyone.	1
I splurged on this double sided feeder, and placed it outside my den window so that I could watch both feeding stations.  This feeder replaced an older "squirrel-proof" feeder that had rusted away two years ago, and had been a sore disappointment in both the birds it attracted, and the squirrels who turned it into the neighborhood hangout.  I've filled this with a good quality backyard bird blend, and have been THRILLED with the birds we've seen during the first week!  We've had the usual cardinals, blue jays, and sparrows, but for the first time, we've enjoyed chickadees and yellow finches.  It has been a true delight to watch during afternoon feeding time.  For over 25 years I've maintained one or two feeders, and done very low-key suburban backyard birding, all in the same 1920's heavily-treed neighborhood.  I have to say that this is the most successful feeder I have put up yet in terms of the birds it has attracted, and the fact that no squirrels have yet made it their hang-out.  As far as the seed spilled on the ground, there's another group of birds that seem to find that attractive, so it isn't going to waste at all.  The feeder comes with a perfectly adequate pole, as well as a hanging arm, your choice which to use in your yard.  The pole put it at window height in my yard.	1
The material used for construction is a bit thinner than I was expecting but it seems to be OK.  For mounting, I use a 3/4 plumbing pipe fitted with a floor flange because the pole that is supplied with this feeder is very weak.  As to squirrel proof - perhaps the squirrels that live in my yard are not as advanced as in other parts of the country, but they have not figured out how to get to the food - other than that which the birds drop on the ground.  Before I bought this feeder, the squirrels could empty my feeder in one day.  I use the strongest setting for the springs without any problem.  The only problem I have noticed is that the metal perch is quite slippery - perhaps it's good for squirrel proofing but a bit tough for the birds. I'm thinking about painting a thin coat of silicon calk on the perch but, for now, I am enjoying watching the birds - not the squirrels.	1
This has been my best 'Squirrel Proof' Feeder to date and I now have six various kinds of feeders meant to keep out the 'grey hoards'.  When filled with mixed seed it also attracts the greatest variety of birds of any feeder I own, particularly Eastern Cardinals. Is VERY heavy when fully loaded and I found that hanging it is more secure than using the included pole. You MUST use a long and sturdy hanger to keep squirrels from hanging onto a branch or tree trunk and bypassing the weight triggered closing mechanism. Will keep out at least 90% of your Squirrels which usually content themselves to forage on seeds dropping to the ground below the feeder.	1
I initially hung the feeder from a branch on an ornamental fruit tree, but discovered the squirrels could reach from another nearby branch and bypass the spring-loaded perches.  Ended up moving it to a different tree where it could have enough side clearance to prevent this.  I never would have guessed the little buggers could reach out a foot with nothing to hold onto until a front paw caught the tray the seeds land on.  They can still get on top of the feeder, grab a hinge or the hanger hook with a back paw, then reach around to the tray with a front paw.  I've not lost much seed this way, but pole-mounting, with a squirrel-guard on the pole would have probably been the best way to go.  Then you also loose the hook.  The only open areas I had were not easily visible from the house.  If it's too close to a tree or the house they can jump.  Let's hope they don't learn how to build hang-gliders.	1
This Absolute Squirrel-Proof Bird Feeder is a clever idea, but it's not as clever as the local Einstein Squirrel who figured out how to hang from the roof of the feeder by one toe and eat his fill of sunflower seeds without putting any weight on the perches that are supposed to make the steel doors clank shut.  That little genius immediately taught all of his friends how to beat the system, and now they take turns all day using the Absolute Squirrel-Proof Bird Feeder as an Absolute Squirrel-Friendly Buffet Table.  In my experience, this invention has been COMPLETELY ineffective.	-1
We've been inundated by squirrels raiding (taking over) our platform birdfeeder that came with our country home.  After extensive searching and reading of consumer reviews, we decided on the Heritage Farms bird feeder.  It looked extremely durable and it holds a lot of seed.  The perches are weight adjustable so you can exclude blue jays or pigeons from eating the seed if you want.  I had the feeder set up in no time and it took about 1 hour before the first bird lighted on it and started eating.  Soon, the word was out and several birds were enjoying the seed.  We look forward to many years of enjoyment - it's built like a 50's metal toy truck, if you're old enough to remember!!	1
My birds thank you - my squirrels and chipmunks are not grateful at all!	1
I use it on oil lamps and it burns consistently for four hours on a pint or longer time. Only draw back would be it could include like a drip less screw on lid to pour into torch. Opening is too big. Could of made it smaller but manufacturing would take longer I assume. So. I should find a "thingie" I Forgot the name of.  Product itself is great! no debris inside. Good oil fuel.	1
The little birds love it. The squirrel barrier doesn't keep the raccoon from using it occasionally.	1
Just waiting for the braces so we can put it on the post. It looks great so far. We'll see what the birds think soon!!	1
Wow! Bigger than I was expecting. Wish the wood had been better treated for moisture.	1
Nice feeder	1
PRODUCT WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED, SPIPPING WS PROMT	1
This design was purchased to replace the same model purchased over 10 years ago. This newer model showed improvements over previous design which should provide even more years of use. Would have rated a 5 star if the quality of the base assembly was of better quality workmanship. It was a simple fix for a handyman, but it is apparent these units are mass produced with limited attention to quality control.	1
Super nice bird feeder.  Looks lovely on our trimmed out and painted post outside of our breakfast room.  My biggest problem is squirrels - not the feeder's fault.  If squirrels can get to the feeder then they will!  They will eat you out of house, feeder and home in no time.  I have let my feeder go dry.  I put a large plastic container upside down in the feeder and poured marbles between the plastic container and the plexiglass sliding view ports....nice burst of color that is pretty to look at.  I have plenty of other bird feeders for the birds that the squirrels CAN NOT GET INTO so I really wanted this feeder for looks.  I also figured, since the squirrels had been absent for months and months that maybe they would stay way.  Hah, never going to happen.  I also have a large picture window separating my breakfast room area from outside that looks right at the feeder only a few feet away from the window which drives my young springer spaniel crazy when a squirrel shows up!  Okay, get rid of the dog or get rid of the squirrels - no contest....get rid of the squirrels.  Happy with the feeder and it is very well made, pretty on the post, does what I want it to do and I would definitely buy again.  I only wish I could keep it filled.	1
This is our fourth feeder of this type.  Three are ours and one for a gift.  It really works to keep most squirrels out but we have one that has figured our how to open the top lid to get the seed.  It is the only feeder that I would recommend for ease of use and durability.  If you are serious about feeding the birds buy this one even the birds feel protected.  In addition it just fits in the 20 Gallon metal trash can that has kept Raccoons from opening the trash can and eating all the seed.	1
Great feeder that holds lots of seed and keep large birds (blackbirds) out. A little spendy, so look for it on sale.	1
Great feeder for small birds. Painterd Buntings love it!	1
This is an attractive and well-made feeder.  But I purchased it to keep out cowbirds and, unfortunately, female cowbirds can slip through the cage and feed to their hearts content.	-1
This feeder has defeated the Blue Jays and the squirrels from pigging out on expensive black oil sunflower seed!  What a pleasure not to constantly have to chase the "pigs" away.  I feel so magnanimous in victory that I feed the squirrels peanuts.  It took the Cardinals about 3 days to get used to the new feeder so be patient.	1
This feeder is truly red squirrel-proof! Most squirrel-proof feeders can keep the grey squirrels from the bird seed, but the red squirrels are the true enemy. This is the first feeder I have owned that can keep the red squirrels away from the seed. I have had it since mid-June, it's now mid-August. The red squirrels try very hard to hang onto the feeder and/or the perches, but they can't do it. They even tried to chew through the top lid but all they did was scratch the coating. On top of this, the birds love it. Grosbeaks, cardinals, finches (gold and purple), titmice, etc, etc, love to sit and eat from it. I would recommend this feeder to anyone with red squirrel problems. It eventually pays for itself because it saves about 50% or more of the birdseed (that used to be consumed by red squirrels).  UPDATE: As of 12/3/2008 this feeder is still going strong. The red (and gray) squirrels cannot position themselves to get any seed nor can they chew through the feeder. After 30 years of birding, this is the best squirrel-proof feeder I have ever tried. It has already paid for itself in saved bird seed.  UPDATE: It's now January 2011 and this feeder is still doing the job. One of the perches broke off last summer but the birds still cling to the seed hole with no problem. The red squirrels still have a hard time with it. The most they can do is jump on and off it to try to spill a few seeds on the ground.  UPDATE: It's May 2013 and the red squirrels have managed to break off all four spring perches. It would be nice if replacement spring perches were offered online through Amazon. We have removed the feeder until we can find replacement perches.	1
It's hard to imagine that ANY feeder is totally squirrel proof.  They seem to grow fifty foot long arms anytime they're near a feeder and they seem to be able to figure out just about anything.  I recommend this feeder because it's one that large birds can't stay on---anything larger than a cardinal just basically falls off the perch because each perch is spring-loaded.  So, if you're bothered by bigger birds taking over your feeders, this is a good choice.  In fact, it's worth the price just to see large birds fall off it.  That leaves four perches for basically finch-size birds and they can eat to their heart's content.  Here in the Southwest we have lots of white-winged doves and all they can do with this feeder is sit longingly on top of it, staring down and wishing they could get the seed.  The feeder has a really large tube, so you won't have to fill it as often, so that's nice.  Then too is Droll Yankees great workmanship and lifetime guarantee.  It's worth the coin!! (Could somebody get Amazon to spell squirrel correctly???)	1
You cannot go wrong with a Droll Yankee product.  I own several different styles of the Droll Yankees and I'll most likely will still purchase them in the future.  This Dipper does work very well against squires.  Never seen a squirrel yet bet it.	1
I got this bird feeder as a present. It does exactly what it says. Squirrels cannot eat from it - they have no place to sit. The top is solidly clamped on - although super easy to remove to refill. So the squirrels just sit on it - chewed it a couple times but it is solid metal so they gave up. The bottom where the  seeds are is too far from the top for them to reach down. So they must try to sit on the perches. Impossible, as the perches are on springs, and the squirrels just fall to the ground. I can hang this anywhere, even right next to the branches where the squirrels come from. No problem - they can't eat from it. Period Had it for several months now, and the birds love it, since the bushy tailed critters don't get in their way. I've seen a few cardinals sit on it, but I think the perches are a bit too springy, and they have a problem. Smaller birds (finches, nuthatches, etc.) eat from this and empty it inside a week. It holds a lot of sunflower seeds, which come out of the feeder holes when they eat, but don't fall out on their own. It's perfect for the purpose it was designed.	1
squirrels are deterred but not large birds like grackles, crows etc.	1
I have tried umpteen feeders. Droll feeders keep squirrels out & are very resistant to rain. I have the flipper, tripper, dipper & whipper. Our birds and I love them all.  Not only effective, but each hold a lot of feed	1
We've had the feeder up and working for about a month now.  The pesky little grey tailed varmints haven't found their way in yet and it definitely keeps the blue jays away.  They tried it and didn't like it.  That'll  save about 100lbs of sunflower seed a year.  It's noisy.  When the birds take off from the perch bars, which are spring loaded to keep the squirrels out, they push down, and then snap back causing a sharp tin like sound.  It took a while to get used to the sound.  Quite irritating at first, but like most things, once you get used to it, it's not so bad anymore.  And it didn't take the tweeters long to figure it out.  The gold finches, thrushes, cardinals and titmice are quite adept at emptying it out about every 2.5 days!	1
The grackles, blackbirds, crows, cardinals all learned very quickly to eat the seeds.  They put one foot on the dipper and the other foot in the seed hole.  Therefore only half their weight is on the dipper level.....so it doesn't dip and flip them off.  And the little birds were being chased away by the bigger birds.   My solution was I returned the Droll Yankee Dipper Feeder and got a wide diameter cage and put my tube feeder inside this.  The small birds hop in an out and eat .....while the grackles at first would go round and round the cage trying to figure where they can get their head through and get to the seed, but to no avail as their head can't reach in far enough....and they give up and pick up any ground droppings.	-1
Ha, ha! No squirrels! Well made. Holds LOTS of seed. Wish there were more posts for birds higher up. Plenty of room.	1
This feeder really works well, it is large and holds a lot of food, I generally only have to fill it once a week despite lots of birds. The other advantage of the dipper is that the larger birds like crows and doves have a lot of trouble raiding the feeder. Its not completely crow proof and I had go to safflower seed until they left after a month, but generally works well. My only complaint is that it is a little clumsy to refill and very heavy to rehang on the hook. Generally well made and holds up well. It is a little on the expensive side but after having the squirrels trash two previous feeders it was worth the money.  winter 2013 update the feeder is still going strong and still is squirrel proof. The squirrels now no longer bother to try and raid my feeder, they go after my neighbors. every once in a while they will try and watching them slip slide away is fun. They have tried to chew the lid off and while it is marred from the effort still hangs on. The only real wear that shows is some weathering of the polycarbonate tube and the latch assembly for the cover is a little bent and requires some care to get back in place. Generally could not be more pleased with this purchase it has lasted well for over 4 years now, the squirrels cant get at it and the birds like it	1
I love Droll Yankee products and this one was no different.  Well thought out and well made.  I have several feeders that are squirrel-resistant but some of them are filled with larger and more aggressive birds, like Blue Jays, Grackles, Northern Mockingbirds, European Starlings, etc.  I wanted something just for the little guys.  Where I live we get both the American Goldfinch (mostly passing through) and the Lesser Goldfinch.  They, along with Purple and House Finches have the feeder pretty much to themselves (yesterday I saw a Painted Bunting at the feeder, WOW!).  Bigger birds, like the ever present White Wing Dove (similar to Mourning Doves) attempt to sit on one of the perches and then they slide off when it "dips".  My only complaint is that the perches seems a little TOO sensitive.  Northern Cardinals can barely sit on one without it dipping, and then only with the help of a lot of wing-flapping.  Still, I really like this feeder for finches and other small birds.	1
great product	1
great gift	1
The kids loved all the animals!	1
I have eighteen in all. This one looks very well with the others. I am glad I took the time to select this house as part of the set.	1
Looks great in my yard hanging from a big pine tree.  It's more for me than the birds.  That's okay for me.	1
The ark is cute but it could have been a more functional real bird feeder rather then just decorative. There is wasted space within the ark but I guess that is all it is decorative.	1
The birdhouse wasn't made very well, construction was sloppy and very bulky. The animals were few and were very dull in coloration. Would not recommend it to anyone.	-1
I collect birdhouses and they are mounted all over my back porch.  This one makes a wonderful addition to my collection and is a really neat idea for a birdhouse.	1
this ark is made pretty good and I like the grapics. I just wish everything wasn't made in China. Would like to see more made in USA products.	1
I bought this for my mother for Mother's Day and she just loves it. While not a bird feeder or bird house, it's just a very cute ornament to hang outside in her garden.  Well made with lots of detailing, just as the picture shows.  There are other wooden bird houses shown with the Noah's ark that I am considering getting my mother for her birthday. I'm very pleased with my purchase.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/When-I-Dream/dp/1608605809/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">When I Dream</a>	1
Fixed my non-working irrigation valve!	1
This solenoid was a perfect replacement for my old one --- and at a reasonable price.	1
Just what I needed.	1
Great	1
Great , replaces Irritrol  valve.	1
works as expected, nothing more to say.	1
No issues is always good.	1
Needed solinoid for a Lawn Genie valve nd this worked great. Quick delivery and correct part.	1
Works well and as expected.  Time will tell on the quality.	1
o.k.	1
Just what I needed for my drip system. I have ordered another one	1
Although the 811 nomenclature matched my old solenoid, this one would not work.  I replaced it with the Orbit 57241 Solenoid which did.  I suggest you examine the tip on the screw end portion of your solenoid and confirm they are the same.	-1
Were exactly what I needed, fit perfectly. Thought it was time to replace my 12 yr old ones. Price was great and shipping was fast.	1
What can you say about a hose mender?  I cut out the leaky part of my hose and install this little goodie, and now it doesn't leak any more.  If the hose is small, you may have to use a little muscle to get this into the hose.  If the hose is large, you may have to put some electrician tape around the hose so the clamp will clamp down hard enough. Not a problem, I thought.	1
I had a hose with a leak in the middle of a 100' hose.  I guess I could have made 2 50' hoses but with this I just cut out the leaky part and slid this on and tightened it up.  The hose is back to 100' with no leaks.	1
Worked great and no leaks!	1
The picture is different from what I received. The screws are NOT stainless steel, the package no longer states lifetime warranty and the part does not say Gilmore, it is more like a $2 Orbit product.  About ten years ago Gilmour started making these in China, the product was still about the same , but now it is cheap brittle plastic.  Returning for refund.	-1
A little pricey, but it did the trick perfectly.	1
I'm violating my own rule and posting a review before I've actually tested it.  But I've already repaired a garden hose with this, but just haven't tested it for leaks and how long it will last. It's made of plastic, though seems durable.  You simply cut out the section of hose that is damaged (trying to keep the ends as square as possible)  It consists of a piece with two ends with ridges that are inserted into the ends of the hose, you then put the clamps over the hose ends and clamp them on to the nipple. One tip:  I pushed the inner piece into a hose end and then realized that I should have put the clamp onto the hose first. So I worked to get it out again and attempted to put the clamp over the hose end, but it wouldn't fit. so I had to loosen the screws and ended up taking them all the way out. At this point I realized that you CAN slide the inner part into the hose ends, then, with the screws loosened, take the halves of the clamps and position them properly and then simply start the screws and ensure that you tighten them both evenly.  In other words, it works best if you take the clamps apart first, then insert the black plastic part into the hose ends, then place the clamps over the ends.	1
Description says that it is for 5/8 or 3/4 inch hose.  It is not.  The packaging says so, and it doesn't fit.  Back it goes.	-1
ok	1
Fixed my hose works good	1
Better than metal - doesn't overheat and cause the end of the hose to fail.	1
k	1
These hose menders work wonderfully.  They are great!!!	1
good	1
Works great. Hose is as good as new.	1
it did repair the hose, no leaks, Gilmour does it right	1
Caution; this mender is sized for the larger 5/8"-3/4" range of garden hoses, not the small short 1/2" hoses.	1
These worked very well to fix my broken hose.	1
Quality product	1
Very solid, very functional, works terrifically!	1
Works exactly as expected.	1
This worked great. I have an old garden hose that had a large leak that just kept getting more and more duct tape. I was ready to throw it out when I realized I needed a hose I didn't care if got ruined but I needed it to function. This mender was exactly what I needed. I cut out the section covered in tape, put the hoses on either end of the mender, and put the clips on. That was it! No more leak! It was fairly easy to put on (and I'm not strong) without putting anything on it. Saved me from having to buy a new hose. Very happy with my purchase!	1
There is always a hose that gets damaged and leaks and these are easy to repair with instead of throwing a good hose away.	1
As described.  Screws turn a little hard	1
Easy to use	1
Usually I throw away broken hoses. But no more! Easy to install & saved me money on hose replacement.	1
Good Quality	1
Fixed a 5/8 hose, simple to use. I've used the hose once a week for the past couple months and it shows no sign of failure. Only complaint is that it now likes to get caught on corners, but I never expected otherwise.	1
worked as exactly as described, saved me from buying new hose	1
Thank You!	1
I had a hose that was so split up, and then it got run over by the lawn mower.  I duct taped it first, then used these and the hose is good as new.  It was a nice long hose I didn't want to have to spend the $$ on a new 100' hose, so this fit the bill perfectly!  Screws fit solidly.  Not worried at all that they will come loose or fall out, because honestly, they took some muscle for this 55 year old woman to get out.  Who knew fixing a hose could be this easy?	1
does the job at good price  would recommend	1
Is a tight fit getting the hose on this fitting but is expected if you don't want it to leak. Works great and I have not had any issues so far. I use it on a regular garden hose that I ran over with the lawn mower. Cut the ends flush and used this to slice them back together.	1
Just as described A++++++	1
excellent	1
these work well when needed to extend a hose	1
Product arrived in a timely manner and was a positive customer experience.	1
exactly as described.  I have these in the past and work like a charm.	1
Definitely works to fix a hose that my dog bit!!	1
Easy to install, worked like a charm, no leaks.  Couldn't be happier!	1
Works good for it's purpose.	1
Worked as expected	1
Work good	1
Did the job works well I have had no problems	1
I JUST PURCHASED THESE 'MENDERS' FROM AMAZON AND USED 1/3 TO REPAIR MY LEAKING 10 YR OLD HOSE THIS MORNING..IT WORKED PERFECTLY/TOOK ABOUT 15 MINS TO COMPLETE THE REPAIR/AND IT DIDN'T LEAK DURING THE PRESSURE TEST/..I NORMALLY DON'T BUY ITEMS MADE IN CHINA BUT COULD NOT FIND ANY MADE IN U.S.A. WITHIN 60 MILES OF MY RANCHO IN S-AZ/SO SETTLED FOR THESE...THE ONLY 'MINOR' ISSUE I FOUND WAS THE SCREW HEAD[SLOT/PHILLIPS] WAS NOT MACHINED TO U.S. STANDARDS SO COULD 'EASILY' BE STRIPED DURING ASSEMBLY IF ADDITIONAL CARE IS NOT TAKEN. HOWEVER ALL THINGS CONSIDERED I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR USE BY OTHERS IF CARE IS USED DURING ASSEMBLY.	1
Large easily read digits.  Appears to be quite accurate and reasonable  battery life.  Good value for the $$	1
way too sensitive	-1
Works fine.	1
Very happy with this product. It matches the humidity indicator on my humidifier, so apparently both are working correctly.	1
I've wanted/needed, shopped, and bought several Hygro-Thermometers in the last 10 years or so for monitoring homes and commercial spaces to informally assess and help diagnose HVAC equipment operation. To date, this unit has given me the most confidence and satisfaction with accuracy and operation in its price point. This is my recommended pick.	1
Works great!  Exactly as described. Fast shipping!	1
This works fantastic, I have no real way of knowing how accurate the humidity reading is, but I think it is very accurate.  I have owned all kinds of humidity guages, and this is the first one I have ever liked.	1
works great-be sure to get the sensor with it. Good purchase.	1
I keep this on the wall of my music room. The guitars and other wooden instruments are very sensitive to humidity and this unit, with its very large display, can be seen across the room to make sure the ambient humidity stays within recommended limits.  Used in conjunction with a humidifier and/or dehumidifier, this accurate and highly visible meter allows you to keep things safe.	1
Have not given it the salt test yet to check calibration, but has functioned perfectly for a month in my music studio. Very helpful to keep temp/humidity levels at proper levels.  Sturdily built. Can put on wall or stand it up. A bit pricey but a lot of the cheaper ones are junk.	1
Has worked fine for 2 months. Have checked it against another humidistat and other ther meters and accuracy is good.	1
They were what they were supposed to be. All is good.	1
These are great; I own four of them now. One issue: the RH adjustment is almost always maxed-out .. and just one point off from being adjustable; I have had each of my four 445715 hygro-thermometers calibrated in an ISO17025 lab against a really high-end RH sensor that is calibrated against a NIST standard at another ISO17025 lab.  A more accurate hygrometer will cost about 10X this one ...	1
Good reasonably accurate Hygro-Thermometer.  One must open the battery compartment to change from Farenheight to Celsius.	1
big numbers easy to read...	1
Bought 2 of these and they are accurate, easy to read, easy to work, and easy to mount.  Nice product!	1
For the few additional dollars, if I were to buy again, I would go with Extech 445715.	1
Hard to calibrate. Otherwise, it is fine.	1
I bought mine used - Like New for $21 delivered.  Works fine.	1
Seems reliable and fast acting.  Have no reason to doubt its readings.	1
You have to love the other reviewers that measure their glowing satisfaction of the hygrometer by how closely it reads to other digital hygrometers they have.  This tells you absolutely nothing of its accuracy.  - I recently purchased THREE of these Extech 445703 Big Digit Hygro-Thermometer units as well as a $19 La Crosse Technology 302-604R-TBP from Amazon.. - I then put all four in a zip lock bag along with a slurry salt mixture which is the only sure way to cailibrate a hygremeter and check for accuracy. - I let them sit for 24 hours in the zip locked bag and lo and behold, all 4  were within 1% apart!  Accurate, right?  Not!  A salt slurry calibration humidifies the air in a zip lock bag to exactly 75%.  The problem here is that three read 66% and the third 65%.  Enough for a glowing rating from other reviewers.  I repeated the test adding two old, cheaper hygrometers.  The four new ones were again all 9-10% low and the two cheap ones were 75% and 76%.  All of 5 them were within 1 degree of the correct temp (69) which is why I gave this unit 2 stars.  If just based on the hygrometer, would have been 1 star.  One of the cheaper but accurate units was the Western Caliber IV Hygrometer  Do the salt calibration and see for yourself.	-1
Excellent, works as advertised.	1
An good looking and accurate device, well worth the money.	1
Very accurate, have several in our home.	1
Nice, large easy to read screen. Appears to be accurate. Durable.	1
Very nice unit	1
fits perfect	1
The relative humidity reading is within 1% of a government weather station half a mile away that provides updates every 15 minutes; often it is identical. The temperature reading is 1 degree higher than the weather station. That's incredible accuracy at any price.	1
This was extremely accurate out of the box.  The temperature was accurate to .1 degree, with reference to a high end Netatmo unit.  The humidity was off by 4%, which is within the mfg. specs.  I was able to calibrate it to 100% accuracy using a Boveda One Step Kit.  The surprising thing is how responsive this thing is.  Just getting near it will change the readings, virtually instantly, no lag time.  I think the fact this has an exterior sensor makes it far more responsive than one which is built into the unit, which many are.  A note on the picture.  It looks much larger than it is, which is 4.25"x4", I wanted to show detail so I got in close.	1
Works perfectly--or perfect enough for me.	1
Very reliable. Good build quality. I'm going to buy another one.	1
This is the real thing. Accurate.	1
Hung this in the garage to monitor temp and humidity.  Quality product that works well.	1
Very pleased with this purchase. It seems pretty accurate, and I can read the big display from across the room. I like to keep an eye on our apartment temperature since we don't have air conditioning. Wish I would've bought one earlier!	1
It works as designed.	1
Great product - use it in my greenhouse.  Handles high temps and humidity well.	1
Ok - it' not all that accurate but it is consistent. At less than $35.00 this thermometer does everything I need. I use it in my car storage area to keep track of the humidity and temperature. I would love one that communicated to my computer and used Excel but I can't justify the expense. This one really does everything I need at the moment.	1
I purchased this hygrometer to go into a bird room that required an accurate humidity reading.  At the same time I also purchased a Vornado Ultra 3 humidifier.  This hygrometer is extremely accurate, and the speed that it picks up changes in humidity in the room is amazing.  I set the Vornado humidifier to 'auto' at 60%.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Extech 445715 hygrometer gives me 100% accurate readings.  I am very happy with this, and will never purchase any cheaper hygrometers again.  They are a waste of money.  If you require accurate humidity readings, you can't go wrong with this hygrometer!  I definitely would purchase it again.	1
I have a large home and have two in the lower level - 1 in a 'guitar room' where humidity is very important.  Another in an unfinished storage room so I know that the humidity is within a normative range.  The other is upstairs in a centralized location - but away from the kitchen.  I tested two of them by placing them side by side.  There was a temperature difference of 1.1 degree (75.9 vs 76.6).  The humidity was identical at 47% with an occasional reading of 1% difference.  So... the calibration seems pretty good.	1
Really like the large display and modern look. Eyes are not as good as they used to be so I am glad they make these.	1
I paid a little more for it, but it seems to be more accurate than others. I've purchased a number of different hydrometers and when you put them all in a row, this one is giving me an accurate reading. It's big and easy to read.	1
Huge letters, easy to ready, accurate, what more could you want from a hygro-thermometer?  I bought two of these, one for the basement to monitor my dehumidifier and another in the upstairs to make sure it wasn't too humid.  So far so good.	1
Works great! Big numbers and shows the 2 things I need to know at a glance, temp and humidity. Been running almost 3 months now and is accurately measuring Min & Max temps and humidity, 24/7.	1
I use this in my wine cellar and it's great - keeps track of the record high and low and gives me instant read out on the temperature and humidity.  Battery has lasted at least 2 years, and the display is easy to read.  A great buy!	1
I needed to measure temperature and humidity for my sun room. I had a wall unit but it fell and broke. So I got this one. And it's great.  Very simple to set up and the numbers are big enough to read from across the room. Comes with an AAA battery too.	1
After my (very unofficial) home testing of this unit, I find it acceptable for the typical home use.  Other posters here have done much more exhausting analysis  Temp readings are right on, and the unit is very responsive.  RH (relative humidity) readings are close enough to satisfy my needs.  Not a bad unit, but not a true scientifically accurate tool to be sure.  I can only offer 4 stars because I believe that the claims for this unit are a bit rosy.  Decent buy though.  Get one.  CARPE DIEM	1
Bot this due to my basement having too much humidity and put in exhaust fans and I have something to base my readings on now. Works good and would highly recommend this to a friend and family or just anybody who wants to monitor humidity readings.	1
I bought two of these for our 38' 5th wheel trailer. They are just great. Very accurate reading and easy to see. I highly recommend this product to anyone seeking the best of this type product.	1
This is the most inexpensive device of its kind on Amazon - a guaranteed accurate hygro-thermometer.  The outside sensor in the product photo is attached to a small cylinder-shaped arm affixed to the side of the unit.  All the twenty dollar type units that provide temperature and humidity levels will generally be in the correct range yet not with precision.  Notice how the diligent reviewers of those cheap units cite comparisons with various hygro-thermometers to each other.  In those citations, cheap units don't agree and it's impossible to know which is more correct.  Better to get one accurate unit and if needed, compare the others against it.  This unit is accurate - guaranteed per the product description.  The sensor is always on the outside of highly accurate units, and normally such units cost even more than this one.  My experience with this unit is positive.  It's more accurate than the temperature gauges in my house that control heating and cooling, for example.  I don't bother with other humidity reporting units because cheaper ones are notoriously inaccurate.  Extech makes many high-tech measuring devices, especially multimeters.  The company is well-known to house inspectors and electricians.	1
Extech makes multimeters and other high-tech devices.  They have tons of products and this one isn't even on their website.  But just check out their hygro-thermometer that costs about 3 more bucks than this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Extech-445715-Big-Digit-Hygro-Thermometer/dp/B000NI4AQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Extech 445715 Big Digit Hygro-Thermometer</a>.  If you compare, you'll see this guarantee under the product description of the one I linked: "Accuracy: 4%RH; 1C/1.8F. Optional NIST traceable certificate satisfies ISO and. other regulatory body requirements for product accuracy. traceability to nationally recognized reference standards."  The difference is the humidity sensor is outside the unit.  All the devices with it inside the unit will be less accurate than if it was outside the unit.  Therefore, I recommend that if you're thinking of getting Extech, go with the one linked above.  Also, Extech is way better than the twenty dollar unit manufacturers.  I purchased and use the product I linked above.  See my Amazon Verified Purchase there.	1
I needed a digital thermometer with a large readout so that I could read the temperature from a distance without glasses.  I also needed one that could be mounted on a wall.  This Extech device fulfilled both criteria admirably.  It seems very accurate too.  It can also be placed on a table top if necessary.  I recommend it highly.	1
The unit was ready to use right out of the box - easy to see from anywhere in the room.	1
Wolf-Garten makes a number of different size cultivators that have similar shapes, making it hard sometimes to tell how they differ from just looking at the pictures. This is a medium large cultivator, about 4 inches across, with thick, heavy tines. It's about the same size as WOLF-Garten Classic Soil Cultivator 1315004, but it adds the weeder on the other side. That comes in handy for cultivating around individual plants etc. However, for weeding large areas, you will still want the WOLF-Garten 3226004 Push-Pull Weeder.	1

Excellent product for hummingbirds and their slaves. Instead of filling 3 X a day, I can do it every other day. Items were delivered promptly and work well. Excellent service.	1
Perfect transaction!  The birds have picked this one as their favorite. Excellent gift idea!	1
Fun, but plastic. Not glass	1
Good but be careful the plastic bird perch can snap easily	1
I had one of these years ago and loved it.  This one looks exactly the same, but functions differently.  The bottom comes apart and also leaks.  Returned it.	-1
This by far is the greatest little hummingbird feeder I have ever bought.  Works very well has all the things that make a feeder easy to care for and the birds just love it.	1
LOVE this--I had so many hummingbirds with this--my original feeder was highly recommended but I mainly got wasps and bees--this one was almost immediately taken over by a female hummer who would perch on the hook over it--I have many photos of her doing this and she would chase any other ones away....of course they came back while she was away!	1
Great little whimsical feeder.  We wanted something a little different but did want 'perches' for our hummers.  This is very well made and delightful colors.  Would recommend.	1
I loved this item because it reminded me of the balloons I would see floating overhead in New Mexico on a cool morning.  Unfortunately the hummingbirds do not feel the same nostalgia.  I had two different feeders.  One in the back and one in the front.  This one remained virtually untouched while the other emptied in two to three days.  I even tried switching locations but it made no difference.  My other feeder is the Perky-Pet 209.  The hummingbirds love it and I love how easy it is to clean.  It comes apart both on the bottom and has a wide opening in the bottle part to get the gross gunk out which seems to happen more and more as the weather heats up.  I make sure to keep it maintained and clean as I have learned that otherwise hummingbirds will become sick otherwise.  Sad that my balloon floated into the Goodwill giveaway basket.	-1
I put up this very cute hummingbird feeder and within 10 minutes I had 3 hummingbirds fighting to get to this feeder. They absolutely LOVE this feeder!	1
Wow, something new. We placed this feeder right next to the tried and true hummingbird feeder to give the birds time to check it out. After a week or two the hummingbirds drink from it regularly just as if it was always there. Fun to watch.	1
Why not get a feeder with some style to it? This one delivers great looks and functionality ...and ... it even attracts hummingbirds  The red color does the trick  Go get one and enjoy!	1
Thought it might be flimsy because it is plastic..  My bottle brushes did fit inside the lip so I could clean it.  I have had it about 1-2 months so far it is lasting.  One of the best things about it is IT IS MADE IN USA...	1
When I wrote the first review I hadn't actually used the feeder yet. It leaks like a sieve and I'm left holding the bag because the return policy is only for one month. Go to Walmart, they're much cheaper and better looking. This feeder is a good size and attractive but it's just a matter of time until the plastic holder on top breaks. It's not a really good deal either, I've seen cheaper ones that are nicer.	-1
This really worked well and didn't harm my five clown loaches and five plecos. I like it so much I am keeping some on hand just in case.	1
When I do a water change sometimes it stirs up the gravel bed and the fish muck.  It has been my practice for years to use this product at half strength in such cases.  It seems to prevent shock and parasitical or fungal problems in that environment.  I also suggest if you have silver colored fish to go half strength. IE, Silver Dollars, Tinfoil Barbs, etc.  Silver colored fish seem to be more sensitive to this product.  I use this at the first signs of stress or disease in the tank.  Follow with a water change and another treatment for best results.  I rarely have to do this more than twice.  For what it is worth my fish are going on seven years of age.  This product has been my first line of defense and really works.	1
One of my fish from one source arrived with the beginnings of Ich so I used this with him. He is now a happy healthy fish with no Ich issues.	1
Like the title says, Kordon Rid Ich Plus is the best product that I've ever used to treat freshwater Ich. While it does help to raise the temperature above 85, I have had great success simply following the directions on the bottle alone; frequent water changes are an absolute must here. If you're trying to treat saltwater Ich, my personal opinion is to avoid copper, and instead put your fish through the Tank Transfer Method (Google it). It is 100% effective if done properly.	1
Helped my sick fish. Does have a strong blue dye in it don't get it on anything you don't want blue	1
Seemed to do the trick fixing my koi	1
Great fresh product that treats diseases fast	1
Works great along with other treatments such as raising the temp.	1
The Kordon Rid Ich works great, and it was a great buy. I use it to treat ich outbreaks in my aquarium tank. It works wonderfully.  It conjunction with raising the temperature of my aquarium, the ich goes away very quickly.  If you do not raise temperature of your tank, it will be less speedy.  But, it will still work over time.  I have had no issues with using the Kordon Rid Ich.  Kordon is a very good trusted aquarium brand in the industry,  It works for freshwater and saltwater aquariums.  It has been scientifically proven effective in the control of external parasites.  Read the instructions carefully.  Be careful with fish that do not have scales, and be careful with invertebrates.  Ich medication can kill them.  You can raise the temperature of the tank and use aquarium salt as an alternative.  Both will kill ich.  Ich cannot live in temperatures above their range.  I always buy them on Amazon because of the lower prices. I have Amazon Prime, so the Free 2-day shipping on my orders are a huge plus.	1
Cleared up my fish tank quickly	1
Works fine in a tank with Amano Shrimp and Cherry Shrimp.  Perhaps I should quality that with a disclaimer.  In my situation, under uncontrolled circumstances, this product has not harmed the above shrimp species using the standard dosing.  When I say "uncontrolled circumstances", I meant that this is not a laboratory situation.  Rather, it is typical home aquarium situation with all of the complications and unknowns present.  So, if you're shrimps are precious to you, then please relocate them to another tank prior to treating the sick tank with this medication.  Do not take the risk if you have the spare tank to move your invertebrates prior to treatment.  Medicating a planted community tank that contain several species is a compromise.  Another choice you will need decide on is whether to raise the temperature or not.  As we have discussed in previous reviews of fish medications, there are advantages as well as disadvantage to raising the temperature.  Doing so speeds up the life cycle of ich.  This is important because this parasite can only be "poisoned" when it is in a free swimming stage.  Medication will not harm the parasite when it is in the encysted stage (the white spots).  However, raising the water temperature will stress the fish, lower oxygen levels in the tank, and could make the tank unstable.  If your tank is already in the 75-78 degree range, then leave it alone.  That will mean increasing treatment time, but it will be safer.  Also,increasing the duration will increase your chances of getting rid of the ich completely.  Follow the directions carefully, do not improvise.  This medication is gentle and has a wide margin of safety.  It will treat the conditions listed on the bottle.  However, please understand that this will not treat anchor worms, leeches, and internal worms.  Those are serious parasites that will require serious medication.  Use this product for the diseases listed on the bottle.  Use this product according to directions on the bottle.  Do that and you will have better success.  Using this product for leeches and flukes is like trying to treat a 30 caliber gunshot wound with aspirin.  Start the treatment as soon as you see the first signs of ich.  Do not wait.  Time is important.  Ich is a fast killer of small, delicate fishes like neon tetras.  Larger cichlids can last a long time with ich.  Sometimes the ich infection has already done a lot of damage to the gills by the time you see the familiar white spots.  For small tetras, it is sometimes too late.  A large, tough specimen like an Oscar should recover.  If one fish has ich, assume all of them has it.  The whole tank will need to be medicated.  Taking only the fish showing white spots to a treatment tank and leaving the main tank untreated will not work.  Ich must be eliminated from the main tank.  The ich is an environmental parasite in the sense that it is in the environment.  In my experience, ich medications are effective.  When treatment fails, it is usually due to violating one of the principles of ich treatment.  Think of ich treatment in terms of treating a large kennel facility that is experiencing a severe flea infestation.  Taking the dog with the most visible signs of flea infestation to a separate building and treating it there will help that dog.  But it will not do anything for the other dogs in the kennel who may be harboring fleas in low numbers, as well as the fleas in the environment.  You have to treat the whole kennel, dogs, bedding, and building.  The same idea applies to your fish tank.  Treat the whole tank.  Highly recommended.	1
Decent product	1
Stopped the ich	1
I tried a few solutions from the store before buying this (and after losing a bunch of fish and shrimp).  Worked well and stopped the kill-off almost immediately.  Turns the water a shade of blue so don't be alarmed when it happens after you apply it.	1
great product  and helps the fish so far	1
good price	1
Works Great in My Tanks.	1
Fish seem happy	1
Perfect!	1
Worked in 2 days	1
Effectively rids your tank of ich.  But you do have to follow directions and not stop the treatment too soon.  Patience is a virtue when it comes to getting rid of ich.  There are stronger medications out there that will get rid of ectoparasites.  Copper is stronger than Rid-Ich and will kill even the most resistant of ectoparasites commonly found in the hobby.  However, copper is not for the novice and its use require you to measure copper concentrations in the tank.  So, to use copper, you really need to own a copper test kit.  Long story short, for something like ich, copper is not necessary.  Kordon's Rid-Ich will be more than sufficient for ich.  Based on my experience, this product is safe for plants.  Mind you, I can only make this claim based on the plant species in my tank.  Rid-Ich seems to be a fairly gentle treatment that has not had noticeable side-effects in my tanks.  I do not have any scale-less fishes in the tank.  These are said to be sensitive to the active ingredients.  Should you raise the water temperature to speed up the lifecycle of the parasite?  That would depend on your fish.  Some species do not like high water temperatures.  Most tropicals should be fine with 77-80 degrees.  At this temperature range, the parasite should complete its life cycle within 7-10 days.  This is important because the parasite is only vulnerable to the medication during certain stages in its life.  You can dose the tank every 24 hours, for 8 days.  Feed sparingly during this time.  You do not want to decrease the water quality during the treatment period by overfeeding.  You can do water changes during the treatment period if necessary, but please keep in mind that doing so will cause temperature fluctuations.  Dose for the actual quantity of water in the tank, as close as you can.  Do not use carbon filtration during the treatment period, as it can remove the medication from the water.  Observe your fish carefully during the treatment period.  The instructions say that you can decrease the time intervals down to 12 hours if the fish show no signs of improvement.  Ich is present in the tank, so even if only one fish is showing the symptops, you still need to dose the entire tank.  Be consistent and be patient during the treatment.  At the end of the treatment period, perform your normal water change.  Clean out the filter, replace the filter media, and add fresh carbon.  Slowly decrease the water temperature, if your fish require it.  Observe the fish carefully for the first few days.  If you see signs of the disease again, it means that you have not eradicated the parasite.  You will need to start over.  Rid-Ich will not work for leeches, tapeworms, and internal parasites.  For worms and leeches, you can use praziquantel or copper.  I would rate Kordon's Rid-Ich as equally effective as Seachem's Paraguard for ich.  Both are gentle medications for the treatment of ich.  This is not a complicated medication to use.  Raising the water temperature is not even required, although it can accelerate the life cycle of the parasite, thereby shortening treatment duration.  However, should you not wish to raise the temperature, you can still treat ich, it will just take longer.  Do an internet search for ich and its lifecycle.  You should not have any trouble finding a chart that shows how long the lifecycle takes for a given temperature.  Use that to help determine your treatment duration.  You can add an extra day or two, just to be safe.  Highly recommended.	1
Suggested by a petco worker as petco has goon to all natural remedies. Did kill my scaleless catfish but saved the tank.	1
used full strength and hasn't hurt my plants or fish. Works fairly quick for eliminating Ich. Follow directions and do water changes as directed. Removing charcoal is not necessary. Research and testing have been done that prove that removing charcoal has no affect on cure time or effectiveness . First read about it on aquariumfish.net . Great product.	1
we use this weekly for our fish tank and we swear it helped them greatly.  they are healthy and before we were losing them weekly until the fish store said they use this product.  we love it	1
Highly rated.  Helped clear up the "ich" that came with my "chain pet store" fish.  This stuff can be harsh on the "weaker" fish - it had a deleterious effect on my neons (meaning they all died), but it did save all of the hardier fish.	1
I've used this product before with no problems and it did a good job of taking care of ich. However, this time I used it in a tank with discus and a large school of neons and black neons. The discus were fine this morning, but every single tetra was dead. The tetras were not sick. I did this as a preventative measure as one of the discus looked to have a small fungal issue. Was paying attention to the tank for the first few hours [as recommended on the label] and all seemed fine.	-1
I have only used this twice but it didn't have any negative effects on my fish.  It worked well and I also raised the temperature some.	1
With having a tank full of tetra, Cory's, clown loaches, and weather loaches, this product is the only one I will use for ick. Very safe when used properly, great product!	1
The effect of this device really depends on a lot of circumstances.  If the wall that is opposite the prism is 4 ft or less, then the prism rainbows will be bright... but if it is longer, then the rainbow becomes dim and harder to see.  Also a window (such as a large window) that lets in too much light will also dull the effect.  So if you have a small window and the opposing surface is 4 feet or less from the window, then this could be a good prism... otherwise the effect is not going to be spectacular.  Though I don't know of any prism that is.  An ordinary equalateral prism can produce a strong, but short/small rainbow.  Maybe some more research is needed. Anyway, I bought this for feng shui purposes more than anything else, and seems to do a lot better than a windchime at blocking negative chi from a funeral home outside of my dwelling.  Maybe not as good as a bagua symbol... but still.	1
HANG IN THE SUN AND YOU WILL BE THRILLED WITH THE LIGHT SHOW IT PUTS OUT!	1
it's not sunny today - but I can tell this is going to be awesome - it's very well made	1
My house gets a lot of sun on one side, so I thought I'd spice up the sunlight coming in and let it add to the decor rather than being plain old sunlight.  I picked this up and am very pleased with the effect, though it did take some effort to find the best place for it.  In direct sunlight, this makes some very impressive rainbows for its size including multiple refraction points (see pics).  The rainbows form a large star pattern around the shadow of the suncatcher.  This means that for most times of the day, the rainbow--much like real rainbows--is going to be going onto the floor a short distance from the window; not exactly exciting.  I was able to work with this, however!  I put this in my stairwell's window to allow more room for the vertical variations of the rainbow positions and the result is delightful!  Ideal placement for this suncatcher is in an elevated window of a white-painted room lit by a single window that gets direct sunlight.  This catcher will diffuse a portion of that sunlight into a large rainbow star pattern around the otherwise direct square of light coming out of the window, giving you lots of rainbow lines around the room.	1
Cheap	-1
The Suncatcher is an attractive way to prevent people, especially children, from crashing into glass sliding doors.	1
Does not work even tho the sun shines directly on it in the afternoon.  Tried changes places, but still barely shows up.	-1
The rainbows created were a huge surprise.  If it didn't cost as much I would buy another one for the other room.	1
Good news & bad news.... Bad News 1st... suction cup sux, does NOT suck to window great, so disc fell & cracked right in half due to poor suction quality of teeny tiny suction cup to stick to window... Good news.... It still works & is gorgeous in the sunlight!!! This is my 3rd one... I had one years ago & the exact same thing happened, then I bought another & left it behind when I moved, so I bought this one & forgot about the horrible suction quality till it broke too...	1
O.K.	1
Very nice.	1
I am very happy with this sun catcher.  It produces vivid colors.	1
love the rainbows	1
nice	1
Love them very cool , grand kids think they are great	1
It does absolutely nothing for me.  It's in a spot where I once had the solar spinner, and this one does not do anything other than keep someone from walking into the sliding glass door.	-1
I hung these in my classroom around finals time this spring. The light finally gets around to hitting them late in the afternoon. They are beautiful.	1
We love the stationary rainbows across the walls.	1
This is my most favorite thing.	1
suction cup falls off window and the prism falls and the glass breaks, end of story	-1
This is the coolest prism that I have and I have lots. The display of rainbows is very bright with a cool pattern. My only complaint is that the sun moves quickly out of line of sight and they are gone much too quickly!  But they are briefly amazing every 24 hours.	1
Incredible. Place on lower inside window to prevent window from not opening.	1
I do like this..  It does exactly as advertized and the rainbows it creates are extremely bright with very deeply saturated colors.  They are static and arranged to make stripes that point inward around a circle.  I"m not a huge fan of this forced form, but the result is a lot of nice rainbow patterns none the less.  ( I guess I'm still looking for that item that simply fills my room with a single large rainbow ).  This works very well to lay down a colorful rainbow base in combination with the Kikkerland Window-Mount Solar-Powered Heart Rainbow Maker.	1
Fantabulous	1
We have about eight glass diamond faceted crystals.  Getting the light to produce rainbows is difficult.  Considering buying or building a light box.  This one is a straight through rainbow.  It throws many rainbows in a large ring on the floor in line with where the sun would hit otherwise.  Since it is plastic I do not have to worry about it falling when the suction pads fails.  Until I find better this is my favorite by far.  Happy Trails	1
This one provides a nice star burst of rainbow strips.  This is best used in a smaller room where the light only travels 15 feet or so.  If you can get it to spin with the A/C it makes a cool pattern	1
It gives much stronger, better rainbows than all the many others I've tried. from a wider angles too.  And quality in incredible: my wife literally drove the car over the mail letter package it was in and no damage at all!  amazing.  the Large tear drop crystal is nice too. and so is the 40mm Heart Crystal Prisms.	1
I LOVE rainbows, and have several solar-powered rainbow makers in my windows.  I'd like to buy one of these, but I don't see a description of its dimensions.  Can someone please post how large this is?  2" across?  6"?  Thank you for any help you can provide!	1
This trap turned out to be a lot nicer than I expected - very clever and easy to operate.  It's easy to set and VERY easy to trip.  I even caught a few sparrows that were silly enough to try to get inside and get the bait.  Thankfully it is also a humane trap so I was able to release them without harm.  One caveat: Though it's called a "rat, mouse, squirrel" trap, apparently it is not strong enough to hold rats inside once it catches them.  The egg-stealing rats in my hen house literally tore the trap to bits and got out by the time I was able to check it in the morning.  Either that or I have some mighty strong rats.  Anyway I would advise only using this trap for mice and maybe squirrels.	1
HAPPY TRAP === This says a lot of truth about this trap for the trapper and the trappee, if that is possible, for WE think no being wants to find itself sitting inside of a Trap === Horrors, but really,WE find this HAPPY TRAP,  IF one needs to have a Trap for any reason are the BEST traps on this planet. WE find The HAPPY TRAPS not only are the most efficient, but the safest, for trapping animals EASILY, RELIABLY, SAFELY, and ALIVE!!! No worry ever have WE found with this trap. And, WE find HAPPY TRAPS are built to trap YOUNG and OLD alike. And, WE find HAPPY TRAPS are VERY sensitive and quick-shut without harm to anyone. WE have tried some of the more widely publicized  and more widely available traps, but WE find that ALL the other traps are NOT reliable, DO harm beings, do NOT succinctly catch small beings or young beings reliably, and are a complete waste of time, energy and money. WE find HAPPY TRAPS are not inexpensive, but WE find HAPPY TRAPS are DURABLE, EASY TO SET, RELIABLE TO CATCH, HARMLESS, and WORTH EVERY CENT WE put in to buying these for certain HAPPY Traps. WE will buy NO other trap for ANY reason. When WE buy these traps through our favorite Amazon, from Maine Supply, WE usually purchase a hefty quantity, not because we need a hefty quantity, but because this Trap is not always so easy to find, and even though Amazon blessedly continues to carry this item, their vendor Maine Supply does not always have this item in stock, and some times, one needs to wait some amount of time for Maine to restock and ship, and Maine Supply seems to be NOW the ONLY source for this HAPPY TRAP. WE find The HAPPY TRAP is all metal and seems to be put together with chewproof materials, at least, WE have not ourselves ever experienced any animal being able to evacuate itself from these Traps. And, once, a rather unhappy Opossum found its way into one of these Traps, but even the Opossum was reliably trapped until the professional was ready to remove the Oppossum. And, after all, WE want a Trap to be reliable for the safety of all concerned. So, WE continue to buy this HAPPY TRAP whenever we need to replenish stock, and WE are fully satisfied to pay the cost of this Trap and not ever buy any other brand. THANK YOU, to our favorite AMAZON for continuing to carry this HAPPY TRAP all the way into the next Millenium, so that WE ALL have ALL WAYS the most reliable and safe HAPPY TRAP on this planet. Blessings.	1
Wow.  This trap has, so far, caught 9 rats, 3 squirrels, and 2 (unfortunate) birds.  Great design, simple to re-set, humane.  Can't imagine a better designed trap.	1
I bought 2 live traps to catch chipmunks and mice.  The first one was the Havahart 0745 livetrap that looks like the original, simple design of years ago where it drops the door if the bait pan is moved.  But - when setup outside that one got robbed of the bait every night. The Havahart just isn't sensitive enough to trap a mouse so they eat the bait.  Then I tried the "Rat, Mouse, Squirrel Trap" Model HT1 made by Happy Trap and I had much better results. It's big enough to hold a chipmunk, squirrel, etc but it's so sensitive it catches even the smallest mouse.  This model uses several sets of spring loaded, cleverly positioned rods to make a very sensitive trap.  Its balanced well enough that it didn't misfired even outside in the wind.  It caught 6 mice and 1 chipmunk in about 10 days and never had a misfire or any stolen bait.  It worked even better than regular and expensive snap-shut type moustraps that were setup nearby.  Those missed half the time or more, but not this one.  It's bigger than a little mouse trap but actually more sensitive.  It only takes about 7 grams of force to set it off.  That's the weight of about 3 pennies so even the smallest mouse will set it off.  I caught a lot of them and weighed a few by weighting the trap with and without the mouse.  A very tiny mouse weighed 12 grams and most are about 20 grams each.  It took a few minutes the first time I set it up to figure out where to position the trip rods since it's an uncommon design. Once I knew how to set it, that took just 10 seconds to set it.  The door is spring loaded so it snaps shut very fast and then a lock bar slides down and blocks the door. Pretty clever.  The Havahart brand trap is more solidly built with heavier gauge wire so that's good but it doesn't have enough planning put into making it very sensitive so it was not very effective.  HT1 trap has thinner wire but is holding up fine and sure worked well for me.  I already ran out of mice so I can retire the traps for a while.  I suspect the HT1 would also work well indoors since I've caught some unusually  small mice with no issue.  And whether a rodent is clever or not, if they weight a few grams and go for the bait they will set it off.  It may be worth noting this type of livetrap may be good if you have pets around since it won't whack your dog or cat in the nose if they sniff or bump into it since it's not like a regular spring loaded mouse trap.  A big dog might break the trap though if he finds it with a mouse in it later.  Good Hunting.	1
The hummingbirds recognize this feeder right away (better than the saucer kind) but it started leaking after a couple months.  Pretty unreliable.	-1
Good purchase	1
they leak.received older one without ant guard that didn't leak at first so ordered 2 more.  easy fill and keep out ants, but as time passes and refill after refill leak becomes worse--I'm so disappointed!	-1
Leaked a bit and then stopped	1
Old review: Best oriole feeder I've tried. Bees can't get into this one, but the orioles can drink from it. It's a little harder to clean, but I have a system that works -- 8" square food container with lid that I fill with hot soapy water, place the base in and shake. The sponge on a stick hummer feeder cleaning tool for inner recesses. Be sure to get the older version, this one. The new version leaks (I have two that I can't use). I like glass feeders, as you can pour hot sugar water into them and let it cool -- sterilizes the glass each time. When cool, you can store the feeder upside down sitting in a plastic container in the frig until ready to use.  I really hope they send the old version for my re-order!  UPDATE: THEY SENT THE NEW LEAKING VERSION! AND I HAVE TO PAY TO SEND IT BACK!! DO NOT ORDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
I love it, and more importantly, the hummingbirds love it!  The new improved larger mouth on the jar, makes it easier to clean and refill.  I have a few different feeders in my garden, and the hummingbirds seem to like this style best.	1
This is one of my favorite feeders.  It holds about 2cups liquid.  My hummers love it a lot, and unfortunately the bees do too.....	1
This seems to be the ideal shape - to a hummingbird's eye.  It's always the one they come to first to feed.  The other day I had 5 female hummers at the bottle at once.  The males, of course, have to play dog-in-the-manger!	1
Love hummer feeders and the glass ones outlast the plastic for years.  My hummers come every year.  Jus boil 1 cup sugar to 4 cups water let it cool and hang it out for the sweeties.  You can add a dab more sugar in spring and fall to nourish them after their long journeys to and fro but don't overdo it because the mixture will get rancid unless changed often.	1
And so do our Hummingbirds.	1
One of the best hummer feeders at a great price.  It is so easy to order these things on line and get wuick delivery.	1
Love hummingbirds. I added this to my feeders in patio.	1
WONDERFUL, just wonderful little feeder. I had noticed some hummingbirds on some of my flowering bushes, but I could not see them unless I was on the first floor level....at the walk out basement level. And, I have a small porch upstairs on the second level directly over the flowering bushes, which is also located off my family room and next to my kitchen. So I hung one of these and within hours the little feeder was visited. The hummingbirds come all day and even visit while my husband and I are outside reading on the porch! It has been an unbelievable joy to see them up close and to hear their little chirps and the whirring of their wings as they fly in. DO NOT add red food coloring to the water and do use plain sugared water. Here is the recipe recommened by the Smithsonian Zoo website, which I use and change every 4 or 5 days: 1 part sugar to 4 parts water....so for this one I use 1/4 cup sugar plus 1 cup water. Bring to a boil and immediately take off the heat and let cool to room temperature. You can make up a bigger batch but that seems more trouble than it is worth and I need the space in my refridge for other things. Be care when you fill the feeder nor to spill any of the sugar water on the feeder itself or anywhere around the feeder....I learned the hard way that the bees, etc. are atrracted to the sticky residue. So, now I am really careful and no problems. Also, the feeder is glass and comes all apart easily so I wash it out well with a little Ivory Dish Soap and very hot water to keep it clean....once a week or every other time I change the water.	1
I purchased 3 of them, and they leak. I had two 32 oz feeders I purchased last year.  One of those still works perfectly.  The other 32 oz split at the weld line in the threaded area and had to be scrapped.  ALL THREE NEW ONES LEAK.  One leaks slowly and only drips out in about 24 hours.  One will empty in about an hour and the third somewhere between. I have tried everything, but can't get them to leak either less or more.  It is not a "tightness" or a seal problem with the glass.  I even put on plumbers tape to see if the leak was coming from there....nope.  It has to be a bad hermetic seal of the weld between the bottom to the top piece of plastic.  This is manufacturing problem that will be widespread.  If they are not monitoring this part of the process, they have big problems.  These are JUNK.  I have to recommend you do not buy.  Wish I could get my money back but all the packing was thrown away.  I didn't expect problems like this.	-1
This is the old style, however this company shipped the Perky Pet new style feeder to me. I did not want the new style because of many.many reviews about how badly the new style leaks! The reviews are absolutely true. We cant all be wrong! The new style is numbered as (Perky-Pet 203CPBN Pinch Waist Glass Hummingbird Feeder). The old style is numbered as Perky-Pet 210P Popular Pinch Waist 16-ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeder. The old style does NOT leak! I have 16 of them so I would know LOL Know to try to see if I can find any of the old style before they are gone and we are stuff with this dripping thing. I am going to find contact information for Perky Pet and let them know as well.	-1
THESE ARE THE BEST FEEDERS WE HAVE FOUND. THEY REALLY SEEM TO BRING IN THE BIRDS. THEY ARE THE RIGHT SIZE AS WELL. ALSO, THEY ARE VERY EASIER TO CLEAN AND HOLD UP MUCH BETTER THAN ANY PLASTIC FEEDER WE HAVE EVER USED. AND, OF COURSE. AMAZON HAD THE BEST PRICE FOR THE SIZE WE WERE LOOKING FOR.	1
This feeder is very popular with my Hummer friends. They use the little perches - most of the little guys will land and sit and eat for a while.	1
All Perky-Pet. I have eight - eight oz. and three sixteen oz.  Even though the birds come and go all day they all show up at seven PM. It's quite entertaining watching fifteen to twenty birds visible at one time.  I get about four days before having to refill.	1
great for the hummingbirds.  Good size and not too hard to clean.  I appreciate the bottom fill feature.  I would buy again.	1
Have purchased several of these for gifts and have several ourselves.  The hummingbirds love them. For under $10 a good buy.	1
I have used this particular model of Perky Pet Humming Bird feeder for 35 years!! I have tried many other feeders from this manufacturer and others but always return to this model. What can I say it works the best.  I have always paired it with a red round steel rain and sun shield with an ant trap above.  The position of the feeder holes and the correct size of their openings keeps almost all insects from crawling into the holes while allowing easy feeding for the Hummers, butterflies, and in very early spring the first of the wild honeybees that become active and sluggishly looking for food.  I fill it with Perky Pet's Humming Bird Nectar mix adding only 3 cups of water instead of 4 cups to each batch.  This is because both the Hummers and the butterflies feed at this particular model and the butterflies and young Hummers need a stronger mix until late summer here in Florida where Hummers usually raise two or three broods over the season. This model also comes in a version that holds a quart of nectar and I use that larger copy of this exact model in spring and early summer in addition to several of this 16 oz. model to feed the many hummers around this large country acreage. These feeders are sturdy and my first one lasted 20 years until I accidently dropped the glass nectar container onto the pavers below the rear deck. This one I purchased recently from Amazon as a gift for my nearest neighbors about a half mile down the road after they saw how active mine was all the time. She hung it on her back porch near the table she uses frequently every day.  When I visited and sat with her at that table I was constantly dodging hummers coming in for a landing at the feeder. I suggested she move it further down the porch but she likes it close to enjoy the birds. After 35 years of testing feeders this is the only Hummer feeder I would ever recommend. Period.	1
I have several of the smaller pinched waist feeders that hold one cup of nectar.  The smaller ones have the ball-shaped bee guards, which must be removed and opened in order to clean them inside.  And you do want to clean them inside to prevent black mildew from growing.  The flat bee guards on this feeder are easier to clean.  Hummingbirds depend on sugar-rich nectar for up to 90 percent of their diet; the rest is made up of insects and pollen that provide essential protein.  Hummers need nectar for their survival.  For those that migrate in the fall, they need to double their body mass before the long trip.  Don't worry:  a hummingbird feeder will not prevent them from leaving.  They are hard-wired to migrate.  Hang several small feeders in different locations.  Best to keep them far apart so that one hummer doesn't try to guard all the feeders!  My three are located in my back yard, side yard, and front yard.  Fill the feeder with the amount of nectar (sugar water) that will be consumed within a week (three days in warm weather).  Use sugar water:  combine four parts hot water to one part white sugar, stir, boil for one or two minutes, and allow to cool.  (Use a stainless steel pot.)  Never use honey (promotes growth of harmful bacteria) or red food coloring (not necessary to attract the hummers).  You don't want red dye in your food and neither do hummers.  I make up the nectar ahead of time and refrigerate it for up to one week in a clean mason jar.  Then when it's time to wash and refill the feeders, the nectar is ready.  Filling the feeder:  using a funnel, pour two cups of fresh nectar into the feeder.  If you don't use a funnel, you will end up pouring half the nectar down the outside of the bottle.  Hanging the feeders in the shade will discourage fermentation. Change the sugar water before it gets cloudy, twice a week in warm weather.  At the end of the week (or half week in warm weather), empty the unused nectar and start over with a clean feeder and fresh nectar.  Experiment with filling the feeder with less nectar if it is not consumed within a few days.  Clean the feeder every time you refill it:  one part white vinegar to four parts water.  The small brushes made for these feeders work well to remove dirt from the small parts.  Rinse all the parts three or four times with warm water and allow to air dry.  Thorough and regular cleaning keeps the feeders clean and also helps prevent the spread of avian diseases.  I use a set of brushes purchased on Amazon.  (See my review and instructions for cleaning.)  Black mildew.  If you see this in your feeder (and you should not if you are washing them with vinegar and water each time you refill them),  mix up a 10% solution of bleach and hot water instead of the vinegar.  Soak all the parts of the feeder for 20 minutes before you begin washing them, using the brushes.  Rinse everything three or four times.  Air dry.  Ants!  You don't want them in or on your feeder.  Ants do not like chalk, so I use ordinary blackboard chalk to draw several rings around the shepherd's hook that holds the feeder.  I also use small reservoirs, filled with water, between the feeder and the hook.  The water can evaporate in a few days, so you need to check it at least twice a week, every day in warm weather.  Heavy rain can wash the chalk away.  Do not spread petroleum jelly on the hook, as it will contaminate the birds' feathers should they come into contact with the jelly.  Be vigilant with the reservoirs and the chalk rings!  Enjoy watching the hummingbirds on your feeder.	1
Ths s the third of these that I have ad. They are wonderful...hammers love them. But the sn beats up the plastic and after two,years r so they ave to be replaced.	1
I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean properly. This one is the perfect size to hold 2 cups of homemade sugar syrup, which the birds love. It took a good few days to a week before the birds would use this feeder. I don't think they like the perches, as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. They don't seem to feed for as long on this feeder as my old feeders either. I also think they preferred my old feeders because they had the raised yellow flowers, this feeder has flat flowers which doesn't seem to attract them as much.	1
This feeder didn't come with nectar guards thus my poor hummingbirds can't drink due to the swarm of bees.  I will be returning both	-1
The only reason I gave this feeder two stars instead of only one is that I like the glass bottle, much nicer than plastic.  Even at that, the glass is hard to clean unless you have an overpriced feeder "mop" or a flexible bottle brush.  Despite the advantage of glass over plastic, this feeder is not even useable.  I hung it in the shade but it still leaks like crazy.  It leaks when the wind blows.  It leaks when the temperature rises.  It leaks just because it feels like leaking.  And that attracts ants, armies of tiny, biting ants.  I've tried filling it to almost the top and I've tried putting just a bit of food in it - doesn't matter, it leaks.  Even if that weren't a problem, I still would not like this feeder.  The plastic bottom and the flowers inserted into it are next to impossible to clean.  The flowers have little ridges that cry out to be filled with mold and nasties.  A dirty hummingbird feeder is worse than none at all.  I think the manufacturer is doing the birds a real disservice by selling something that is likely to end up with dirt and mold, and be bad for the birds.  So, this product is for the birds.  And very much NOT for the birds, not if you care about them.	-1
I received this feeder from Woodstream (Parent of Perky Pet brand) as a replacement for the wildly poorly designed 120TF model. Although it had a tiny initial leak, which took a while to detect, it was easily fixed and has been serving well since.  After filling the unit for the first time with home brewed sugar water (1 part sugar to four parts water), I found that the birds seemed to be able to down a cup of liquid in no time at all. The tiny leak on the bottom of the unit showed itself after my wife and I noticed that one of the hummingbirds was feeding off of the BOTTOM of the feeder, licking the bottom inside of the rim. An inspection of the area below the feeder showed a building crowd of ants feeding on the occasional drips. At the next refill, I took care to find the lead site using water during the cleaning (*** Note, I follow the instructions to avoid soap and detergent and use hot water. My experience is that hot tap water works great if you wash the unit twice a week as I do ***). After carefully drying the base, I used some liquid model airplane cement to penetrate the crack where the leak was coming from. Althernately, I could have used silicon rubber sealer, but my thought was that the glue would penetrate and seal the crack better while the sealer would leave a channel for the sugar water to be trapped in and breed bacteria. Also, the glue dries way faster and I had impatient customers hovering in my yard :-)  This quick fix did the job and the 210P retains all of its food for the birds. In our case, the three birds that frequent our yard in the SF Bay area drink about a cup every 3 days. So, I do not fill the whole reservoir (16 oz or two cups) since the instructions, and most online commentaries, say to change the food out every 3 days or so to reduce bacteria growth and keep the birds healthy. BTW, if you leave your leak on the bottom un-repaired, it is also better to have less fluid in the tank because it will put less pressure on the leak and reduce the loss.  Finally, if you really don't feel like you want to repair a new feeder, Woodstream customer service seems to be quite responsive. A quick call and they will send you a new unit. Happy Hummer-watching!	1
I keep going back to this feeder because of its volume only to be reminded that it usually leaks.  Bees love it for this and the hummers have to dodge bees to feed.  It seems to leak from the bottom v. the feed sites or the bottle entry.	-1
Purchased 4 of these feeders and one of them leaked profusly right away. Sent it back and Amazon replaced it with another one that also leaked. Since then, the other three started leaking also. Don't know if I can still return the entire batch since it has been a couple of months, but I am going to try. I had these same feeders in the past and they lasted several years. Somebody "improved" them.  Update: I contacted the manufacturer direct since the Amazon return policy is only good for 30 days and they replaced all four feeders with no hassel whatsoever. Havn't received them yet, so I don't know how these will perform.	-1
This is an excellent feeder. NO leakage like a lot of feeders. I have 7 of these feeders. Very happy with the product.	1
very nice feeder.easy to take apart & clean.wife has a lot of different feeders this one is one of the better one to own	1
There is something about feeding hummingbirds that creates an almost Zen like feeling.  Watching them as the fly around and feed multiple times a day.  They are actually quite friendly and many will fly within a foot of you or less and listen to you talk to them.  We have had this feeder for several years and it is the best one we have owned.  It is easy to clean up with the large hardened glass bottle and the hummingbirds like the perches to sit on.  We like how the bottle screws into the base and then you can flip it and hang it.  I even have a photo of a hummingbird, a monarch butterfly and a honey bee drinking at the same time.  In the summer time the humming birds can drink up the sugar water like crazy.  Now if I could only get them to stop fighting over it.  They all think that they own it and they sit there all day long and guard it like it is their personal lunch line.  Feeding hummingbirds is fun and enjoyable.  This is the best feeder we have owned out of about 5 styles.  Try it and you will like it!	1
The hummingbird feeder came well protected and packaged.  The price, two-day delivery, was some nine dollars less than the local stores price of $23.99 vs Amazon's delivered price of $14.48.  We can't afford local brick-n-mortar pricing, so with all due respect, they'll have to survive without our money.  We have another one of these already up and have been using it for years without problems.  Somebody mentioned the included wire hanger.  I simply knot the end of the wire, string it though the cap and tie a loop for hanging purposes.  Takes a few minutes with a pair of needle nose pliers but doing so works a treat.  The top holder is a screw on plastic top.  So, as long as the top is intact, one doesn't need to worry about the glass container falling and breaking on the cement patio below because the top cap slipped off the glass container.  As to cleaning this unit, yes, we do use a few drops of laundry bleach and dish soap.  If one takes the time to heavily rinse the container out, a dangerous level of residual chemicals isn't left behind.  The choices are, use a few drops of bleach and dish soap or allow a heavy accumulation of fungus to grow.  Not much that I've found in the middle.  I find that an inexpensive baby bottle brush also helps with the cleaning of the inside walls of this container.  A healthy bit of caution and creativity goes a long way in safely cleaning one of these feeders.  Overall, this is a quality product, at a low by comparison shipped price, that will give the user many years of trouble free use.	1
I keep going back to this feeder.  I've tried others but the hummingbirds seem to really like this one.  However, it seems some that you get are leaky to start with. So, it definitely is some of these are not being checked properly before being sold. I like the way the 30 oz. Perky Pet is constructed a lot better and wish they would do the same with the 16 oz.	1
Feeders came way before they were due.  I no sooner had it up when the hummers were slurping from it. They were packed well; and had no trouble with the filling them and hanging them.	1

The nectar leaks all the time and the bee guards are full of bees.  This isn't bee proof by any means.	-1
My wife liked this for the first year but the yellow combs fall out very easy and get lost. We ended up tossing it after the first year as 3 of the 4 combs were lost. Other than that we enjoyed it very much as did the hummers.	1
Good product.	1
Hummingbirds love this feeder. Not too difficult to clean, opening is narrow so you definitely need a bottle or hummingbird feeder brush. Bee guards fall out pretty easily which is annoying.	1
I thought I reviewed these already. These hummingbird feeders leak. The seller was great and refunded my money but I wouldn't buy these again.	-1
I like this newer, updated version much better than the previous design that required a small funnel to fill the jar. With this wide mouth design I can fill directly from the pitcher that I use to store my homemade sugar water.	1
Excellent	1
It's not that I like this one but the Hummingbirds have voted for this one. I had several different ones and they picked this one above all others so I bought three more to replace the others. So far, the red has not faded and it is easy to clean.	1
The "new and improved" design of this feeder is not improved at all in my opinion.  My hummingbird feeder hangs where it receives direct afternoon sun and although I had no problems with the old design, this new design leaks and drips constantly.  Completely unusable in direct sunlight because all of the sugar water is soon on the ground instead of being in the feeder available to the hummingbirds.  Since it seems that the old design is not available for purchase any longer, I'll be shopping for another brand.  That's too bad because the old design feeder had been my favorite.	-1
Leaks in shade or sun.  I do like the bee guards that can be opened for cleaning, but that's it.  I thought the extra wide bottle mouth would be convenient for re-filling, but the thing constantly leaks.  No amount of tightening or readjusting stems the flow.  So if you plan to position this over anything you want to keep clean and ant free, like a patio, try a different style.	-1
These are the feeders with the narrow mouth and they don't leak!!!!! The ones with the wide mouth leak!!!!!! I have 6 of each and the wide mouth all leak! None of the narrow mouth feeders leak!!!	1
Hummingbirds come around for the entire season.	1
Have 3 of these!!  May buy more this spring!	1
Item arrived on time and was as advertised. Completely satisfied	1
The hummingbirds love this.  They do use the perches.  Bees cannot get in.  Well made.  Good price.	1
Good feeder. Bought 3 and they all had a slow leak. Somehow the leaking has stopped and they're working fine now.	1
The birds love these	1
The birds love it	1
I like the design, and the birds seem to like it too.  The perches are removable, but the hummers nearly always use them, and I figure it sames them energy not having to hover.  I can't say how long it will last, but it seems to be well-made and it is quite attractive.	1
Finches love it.  We put it up for hummingbirds, of course, but the finches are all over it all day.  We refill twice a day.  Actually we have 2 of these feeders and with the finches waiting in the trees, we take one down and put up the other the same time.  We did take the bee guards off for the finches.  If we get a bee problem we can always put them back on.  The glass is very sturdy and easy to clean.  We live in Arizona and I always leave one pre-filled in the fridge so it starts out cold.	1
AAA+++ just as ordered!	1
Not the prettiest but the one the birds go to first and most often. Easy to clean and refill. Doesn't leak.	1
fair	1
Love this feeder -- easy to use ... easy to clean and the little birds love this	1
Very good product	1
leaks really bad....less than 1 year old...I bought this last august and it worked great. Then I washed it and put away for the winter and now it leaks horribly....I tightened the screws thinking that was the problem, but it continues to leak really badly. I have it hung on my upstairs porch so there is no problem with any other critters getting at it....but the sticky puddle that results is a big problem. I am just trashing it. do not buy this feeder.	-1
Perfect Hummingbird feeder. My hummers love them. Well made and easy to fill. No bee's, A plus. The hummers love to perch to feed and are at them all day long	1
I love it and so do my hummers! I live on the second floor of the apt. house and have it on my patio. It was easy to fill. I may have to buy another one. It looks like two pairs of birds are fighting for "first dibs".	1
The humming birds have give their five star approval.	1
changing my 5 star review of the old Perky Pet model to 1 star for their 'new improved' model which leaks constantly making a total sticky mess everywhere.  threw away my two new Perky Pet feeders and ordered another brand that don't leak.  so disappointed in Perky Pet, they had such a great product for many years.	-1
What arrived was similar to picture. Not exactly what expected but o.k.	1
This is the BEST hummingbird feeder. Period!	1
Birds loved it. It was a little hard to keep clean. Overall an okay hummingbird feeder.	1
This hummingbird feeder is my favorite out of all I have tried and I have tried many of them.  The hummers always come to this one over anything else I've put out there and yes they are picky.  I don't mind spoiling my babies at all.  I do make my own sugar water mixture and wouldn't touch the premade stuff with a 10 foot pole.  It's just not good for them with the dye in it.  This feeder will stand up to just about any type of weather except for this sub zero stuff we are having right now I suppose.  The hummers also like the little stands so that they can relax a bit while taking their fill of sweetness.  I have several of these as I have found that having just one or two the hummers get territorial with them.  Stinkers.  Oh well, they are like children and they have to have their own way but I won't complain because they are my favorite babies.	1
These feeders are so easy to maintain and clean.  The hummingbirds love them.  The little perches are used frequently and give us a great opportunity to watch the birds as they feed.  Contrary to myth, they do perch and stay still occasionally!	1
Small, but fierce.  Well made glass feeder with a plastic base.  No leaks. Easy to clean if you use the right stuff.  I have this feeder in the shade.  My hummers go through this feeder in one day during the summer and in two days during the winter.  (I live in Southern California).	1
These glass ones are the best and also like this size. My opinion is the large ones are a waste, because you are supposed to change the stuff every 3 days. so this size is perfect. I just have more of them around my back yard. I have 5 or 6 of these.	1
Lost of use. After a couple years they fall apart, but i am happy with them still.	1
The one we got leaks really bad, won't buy again.	-1
This will give you a lot of cheap entertainment, since hummingbirds are ferocious when it comes to defending their food sources.	1
GREAT FEEDER====	1
I feed the hummingbirds and have honey bees so this is the type of feeders I need	1
Exactly as agreed upon.	1
Like it	1
Leaks!	-1
Makes my birdies happy	1
I've had many feeders but they like this one the very best.	1
Looks nice and the humming birds like it, but it leaks, Bad. Most of the fluid leaks out before the humming birds get it.	-1
All Good.	1
My Hummingbird loves this feeder. it was so natural for the Hummingbird as soon as i hang the feeder, the bird came and landed on perch, allowing it to rest during feeding.	1
I really like this feeder with one exception... I can't find a brush small enough to go inside the glass bottle.	1
Honey bees still get to the nectar and swarm around this all the time.  Honestly, I haven't found one yet that does ward off bees. It is a good feeder to welcome more than one hummingbird at a time, though.  Fairly easy to clean and easy to refill and hang. I would buy it again.  I just hose off the feeder outside every now and then between fillings and it deters the bees for a while.	1
I've been feeding what is now a large flock of hummingbirds for 22 years (Ruby Throated).  I don't know exactly what it is about this particular feeder that makes it so special to them.  I can put up ANY other kind of hummingbird feeder, they won't touch it.  This Perky Pet feeder can go bone dry while another brand of feeder 10 feet away is full of fresh juice and the little boogers won't touch it.  It's been that way for 22 years!  I'm sure I'm not the only one who has seen this feeder preference obsession. We brew our own 4 to 1 water to sugar mixture for them.  You don't need colored juice.	1
I am totally happy with this hummingbird feeder. It is a great price and my hummingbirds really love it and discovered it immediately. It is very easy to clean and refill.  Thanks very much.	1
great !!!	1
Love the wide mouth feature.  Makes it so much easier to clean and refill.  Only disappointment is the little "S" hanger provided is not functional for me.  I'd prefer the red plastic coated wiring Perky-Pet has always provided with their feeders.	1
Another good product.  Attractive for the birds - priced reasonably - delivered to my door.	1
This is the best hummingbird feeder we have ever had. Hummingbirds love it, and, to our surprise, so do woodpeckers. It is a great way to help the birds and to also watch them from close by.	1
Great items made by Perky Pet.  Just with they had kept the old bee guards.	1
This old design is hard to clean because of the narrow neck on the glass part. Without proper cleaning the hummingbirds will get sick. These feeders often come from Amazon with missing bee guards. The bee guards do not stop bees from feeding st the feeder, but, do prevent bees from getting int the feeder and drowning. Extra bee guards with Prime cost $6.25 for four and you need to have them on hand even if the feeder arrives complete. From time to time a bee guard will fall off of a feeder and be chewed by a squirrel. I continued to use this design because it was cheaper than the new one and parts interchange. I do not recommend this old style and will not buy another one.	-1
So, I had so many hummingbirds this year, I had to order another feeder.  This is the one that they like the best!  They empty 4 of these twice a day during July and August.  This is the easiest to clean and refill.  A must for anyone's yard!!!	1
This feeder is my hummingbirds favorite.  They fight over the two that I have.  It has little perches for them to sit on while feeding and there is an ant trap on top.	1
This is a great size and the little perches for the hummingbirds to sit are awesome.  Now when I watch the birds they actually sit there for a second sometimes and I can get a good look at them!	1
There is something about feeding hummingbirds that creates an almost Zen like feeling. Watching them as the fly around and feed multiple times a day. They are actually quite friendly and many will fly within a foot of you or less and listen to you talk to them.  We have had this feeder for several years and it is the best one we have owned.

I think it is the best one out there	1
thanks	1
The Perky-Pet Hummingbird Feeder is a hit in my garden.  I have lots of hummingbirds this year and two feeders, and the Perky-Pet is the birds' favorite feeder.  I have to refill it every day.	1
Great humming bird feeder..  They really like it and it's inexpensive..  I have 2.	1
more important the birds (hummingbird and hooded oriels) love it	1
All expectations met	1
Love it.	1
The feeder is of great quality and well made.  This order was mixed up in that I wanted a kit of the yellow filters that go in the red 'blossom.'  I ordered the feeder first, then went to order the kit, only to find the kit was a special item that required it to be ordered with something else.  I went to the account, cancelled the order for the feeder.  Then went back to the catalog, put the kit in the cart, added the feeder to the cart, and completed the order. Unfortunately, the order arrived with only the two feeders.  Bad karma in the order department.  I decided to keep the extra feeder due to cost of return verse the cost of the item.  I ordered the kit elsewhere.	1
Best one EVER!  Here's why: 1. No Bees - they can't get in,, bee guards work. 2. Easy fill - no spill  3. No ants - Vaseline on hangar and anti-ant design work 4. Four port access - more than one bird at a time  Will buy another one for the back deck	1
Messy when refilling it, gets all over	1
I thought it would be great, but it leaks all out, not sure why, but very annoying to have it drip all over my front porch since we know what sweetness brings.. ANTS !!	-1
Love this feeder, rain water doesn't get into it	1
We've tried others, but Perky-Pet Hummingbird feeders are simply the best. They last longer than other brands, and attract tons of little hummers to our yard. Can't go wrong with Perky-Pet.	1
A fine feeder, but go for the newer version with the wide mouth.	1
I like how the feeder appears to be big, but the part that holds the water isn't really that big.  I feel like I'm not wasting sugar water when I change it each week.  Hummingbirds love this thing.  Nice watching them hover around and feed.	1
Decent hummingbird feeder. Durable.	1
Love it, it comes apart for full cleaning. I have three so that I can just switch out the feeder - and so that I can make larger batches of nectar and fill a feeder the night before swapping the feeder out so that I am not putting ice cold nectar out.  I can clean the one I took down without missing out on birds coming to the feeder.	1
What a great design. I can't believe this product is selling for the price I paid. I'm a product designer and can appreciate the detail and thought that went into this. Every part comes off to make it easy to clean. The flowers remove as well as the wasp guard baskets and even those are hinged so you can easily open and clean them. WOW! The top removes so you can dishwash the glass or stand upright while filling.  The only thing I didn't like was the tiny hole that made it difficult to clean out the inside of the glass. But you can't have everything as it is important to the overall design. I cut a thin strip of sponge and used a skewer to wipe the inside and it slid right out when I was finished.  There are a lot of negative reviews on this. It does take a bit of work to clean, but the birds and I just love it.	1
I expected to get what the picture shows, and the Humming Birds might have liked this one. They sure do not like the one that was sent instead. I am going to a bird supply store to find its replacement.	-1
Nice glass body with plastic "flowers" - in a nice size.  You do not want a Large hummingbird feeder so this nice smaller size is perfect.  A too large feeder just results in having to dispose of the "old" nectar after 3 days as it ferments and then the hummingbirds do not want it.	1
I have two of these small feeders now. These are the favorites for the birds in my area. They will go to these first before they go to the larger ones. My only complaint is the size. Even with two the birds drain these in a few hours.	1
AAA seller.  The hummingbirds love it.  I've tried three different feeders and this is the best.  The birds like a nectar of 1 part sugar and 4 parts water the best of all -- better than the prepared mix.	1
The hummingbirds and finches love this feeder! Its light weight, durable, and holding up very well in the Texas sun & heat.	1
Of all the hummingbird feeders I have tried, this is my favorite one.  The large red flowers are great at attracting hummingbirds and we usually have two or three birds buzzing around all day drinking the nectar.  The only slight drawback is that the feeder is a bit hard to clean.  You will need to purchase a long, thin bottle brush to be able to scrub the inside of the cleaner.	1
Design is a bit flimsy.  When I tried screwing the bottle back into the base, I had difficulty lining up the plastic threads and inserting the fill bottle without it going in slightly crooked.  It holds 8 ounces of nectar which is a good thing for me since I can mix up a single batch of hummingbird mix in an 8 ounce measuring cup quickly. Especially useful since the opening of the fill bottle is VERY narrow.  If you are filling this bottle up, you need to have a measuring cup with a lip on it or refilling this feeder becomes a messy chore.  If you try pouring your nectar mix from a jug, be prepared to use a VERY small funnel or do it in the kitchen sink since it is hard to fill.  You can't see it in the picture, but the fill bottle has an opening that is about 3/4 the size of a standard size 2 liter soda bottle opening.	1
I have 2 of theses and I get lots of hummers! You must keep them ant free and clean and the hummers will come for food! Be sure to change the food often, especially if they are in the sun.	1
Often sold in garden stores, but the price here was better. It's outside all winter (down to 25 degrees) and has held up well.	1
Yes, it's inexpensive and yes, it works adequately to feed hummingbirds. BUT, it's a bear to clean and it needs to be disassembled and cleaned regularly.. It holds one cup of sugar water and was fine for the first two weeks (cleaned and replaced sugar water each week). During the third week, mold started to grow in spots inside the glass container and on the plastic flowers. The only way I could remove the mold inside the bottle was with a toothbrush. I had to disassemble the entire feeder and clean each part. Very tedious. If there were no other choices out there, this would do but there are better ones available for a little more money. Spend a bit and save a toothbrush.	-1
No hummingbirds yet but nice feeder, I recently moved it to a different spot in the yard, so we'll see if that helps attract more birds.  Easy to fill, holds the liquid well.	1
I have been using Perky Pet Hummingbird Feeders for over 5 years now and this model is by far the most effective.  However, they've improved the bee guards--they are rounded now instead of flat and stay in so much better.  I have 3 other HB feeders and this is the only one my birds come to.  Great price as well.	1
I have bought several of these over the years from Home Depot for more money.  This one is of the same quality and is made by the same company, but less expensive than the Home Depot ones.  They don't leak or drip and bugs don't get in it very easily.  But like any hummer feeder, it should be cleaned and refilled on a regular basis.	1
I got this last year,it worked great. Hummers love perches. This year it has leaked and I can't find out where or why. Needless to say I have had to remove it. I did salvage the perch and attach it to another feeder like this that I have had for years. It is not the easiest to clean,but can be done.	-1
This product came to me where I had to put the yellow center's in the product.  The stands are flimsey and the nector leaks.	-1
The design on this hummingbird feeder allows other birds to drink from the petals because the petals are at an angle and not level so I don't recommend this feeder.	-1
We have several hummingbird feeders of different designs. It is obvious that the birds prefer this one because of the perches. Wish they made it in a bigger model!	1
Looks just fine. Will use along with Perky-Pet 203CPBN. I think these will work very well for my needs. I only make my own sugar water mixture.  Never packets.	1
There is always one hummer who will take over a feeder and run everyone else off. This small feeder is just right for the bully.	1
I had ordered 3 of these in the early winter preparing for spring Hummingbirds. My last set of feeders were getting old. I put these feeders out a few weeks ago and noticed two very troubling issues with them. One: when they swing in the air the angle of the feeders is such that the sugar water seeps out of the individual feeders.  Makes for a nice feeding area for 'ants' and I have had one feeder almost completely drain onto the ground due to persistent windy day.  And Two: The feeder filler necks are very small and you are bound to spill while refilling. No big deal but again, a poor design. My old ones were so much better. I am going to shop locally for new ones. These just won't do!!!!	-1
The Perky Pet 203 CP is difficult to fill and clean since the only opening is the diameter of a soft drink bottle.  Perky Pet makes other models which open on both ends allowing you to clean and fill the glass jar though the larger end.  That means that you can use a soapy paper towel (rinse well afterwards with hot water to remove all traces of soap), to clean the bottle rather than having to purchase and use a narrow bottle washer brush.  This model also lacks and included hook for hanging.  I have and far prefer the Perky Pet&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Perky-Pet-130TF-8-Ounce-Glass-Top-Fill-Hummingbird-Feeder/dp/B007UII50W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Perky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Top Fill Hummingbird Feeder</a>&nbsp;which has not of the above shortcomings and is a easy to fill and clean.  It comes with a small "S-Hook" for hanging, too.	-1
This is a nice feeder and I prefer it to the cheap plastic ones. I have refilled it four times in a month so far and have not had any trouble with it. Hummingbirds seem to like it too!	1
Good price for a well-constructed product. I've had fancy ones. Something always goes bad: a gasket that leaks after a year or two; plastic parts that break. So I figure it's not worth getting something more expensive. This one is sturdy and not hard to clean.	1
Buzz, my Anna's male hummer who has claimed my yard and this feeder as his own, seems to like this feeder.  I have two now, I rotate them each week as I clean, refresh them.  They are a bit hard to clean, I use a toothbrush to clean the feeder part.  The newer one is a bit different than the one I got a couple years ago, the perches don't seem as good, seem a bit short, but, it works so far.  Price is right anyway, especially if you only have one or two hummers that use it.	1
We have lots of hummers and every year I seem to need to add or replace a feeder. This design is definitely their favorite.	1
I have only had a few other kinds but this one is the birds favorite. I use a bottle brush to clean it. One will last about 4 seasons before the plastic basic will show some where and get a little loose to screw on the bottle.	1
Nice hummingbird feeder, easy to open and clean,  I like the perches for the birds to sit on. It looks like it will attract the hummingbirds.	1
Birds love the feeder and attracts many different humming birds, we have multiple feeders as humming bird males become very territorial, so we space them out so they can be shared.	1
although the capacity is some what small its a good hummer feeder that will not disappoint. its a go to feeder	1
I bought this glass feeder to replace a plastic feeder I had that was leaking. I had another glass feeder identical to this one and that is why I purchased this.	1
I have several Perky Pet feeders and these seem to be the ones that the Hummers like the best. I highly recommend.	1
I HAD TO REMOVE 2 OF THE FLOWERS-THE RED LEAF PART SO THE BIRDS COULD FIGURE OUT THAT THE FOOD COMES FROM THE YELLOW PART!  BUT NOW THEY ARE USING ALL 4 SIDES.	1
Not too hard to clean.  I appreciate the bottom fill feature.  I would purchase again.  It is a good size to watch the birds.	1
Bought it as a Christmas gift have not used it yet.  Waiting for Spring to come and will set it up.	1
The ants, hornets and wasps love it.  They also get stuck inside the screen which is supposed to keep them out.  The hummingbirds don't seem to like it.  Read my review of First Nature 3088 32-ounce Oriole Feeder.  The hummingbirds do like this one, and the pest problem is reduced to just ants.	-1
The little Hummers like this style of hummingbird feeder at my place. and stay all year long. Easy to clean	1
I have these all over the yard.  The Hummingbirds love this feeder.  It is very durable and this will be the 4th season for me to use them.	1
I love this feeder.  I only have to fill it every three days as it is in the shade the majority of the day.  I've had mine well over a year with no sign of aging or even fading of the plastic parts.  The glass holder is sturdy and has not broken even though I've dropped it twice on my kitchen floor.  I am ordering another one today while on sale.  Glad would pay the full price for this, though!	1
Our hummingbirds show up every spring, hover at the window until I put the feeder out. They seem to like this kind for some reason. I have had other types and they ignore them. Whatever works ! The hummingbirds have voted.	1
I've had a lot of hummingbirds this year and they seem to love this feeder	1
This is a good size for the times of the year when there aren't as many hummers around and you just need a little feeder.  My hummers seem to like the glass feeders better too.  I wish it had a bigger neck though because it would make it easier to clean.  Because of it's size, it works better to just fill it with a mixture of bleach and water and let it soak for an hour to clean it.	1
I have tried several hummingbird feeders to no avail.  A friend recommended this one and told me to simple make up my own sugar water without dye or color. I  did.  A week or so later, out came the hummingbirds.  I bought a second and plan to get two more next year.  I just LOVE the hummingbirds and the hummingbirds clearly LOVE the feeder.	1
Amazing Hummingbird feeder. We've tried several different feeders. All were pretty much dismal failures. We would get a visitor every so often. I put this up yesterday and we've got three different birds all using it every few minutes. It looks more like a natural flower than most of them and it sits at an angle they like. They actually sit there for a minute or so eating. You can see the bubbles. We made our own food using 1 cup of sugar & 4 cups of water. Boiling for a couple of minutes to flash off chlorine. We're using no color die. We're ordering another one today to put near our kitchen. What Fun!!!	1
What can I say it is a bird feeder for Pete's sake.  Nice and easy to use.  As usual the birds liked it.	1
the Hummer birds like it, so why should I? I wish it had its own supply of nectar that it would re-fill itself!	1
I have another style of feeder, as well, but this one is the birds' favorite.  I've found that having a couple of smaller feeders also works better than one big one.  You waste less nectar.	1
I have had about 6 feeders-This feeder is the best!-We get 3-4 hummers feeding a once-sturdy and functional-Love it! Thanks	1
This one is the second of the same style that I have- with one exception- the "bee guards" are better- rounded instead of flat- seems to prevent the wasps from swarming as much (although not entirely) I still keep a wasp trap a few feet away to lure them and let the hummingbirds not have to fight so much to feed.	1
I purchased this feeder for a Valentine's Day gift...and have been enjoying our hummers all summer. (We had at least 4)  The only thing that is needed is a small brush to clean the bottle from mold that builds up on the inside glass.  I have been using a toothbrush with fairly good results.  As the birds fly south for the winter, I will give it a good bleach bath and pack it away for winter.  I would definately recommend this product.  I also ordered the ant moat...that was excellent keeping the ants away too.	1
Have tried several other types over the years but the birds and I think this one is the best.  Easy to fill and keep clean. Have three in use from April to Aug.	1
I've tried others, but have found this design to be the most functional for me.  Easy to switch out with a fresh bottle that I keep in reserve.  The one cup capacity is enough since I have several placed in different locations.  Very little goes to waste as I must change the nectar often in the heat of the summer.  Would suggest using with an ant moat.	1
For an inexpensive feeder this one is a good value.  The bottle has a small opening so it's a little hard to get a regular size cleaning brush inside.  However, the birds love it and the bee guards are fairly easy to remove for cleaning.	1
This is the BEST hummingbird feeder ever.  Do this:  pull off the bee guards, pull off the big red flowers, put the bee guards back on.  That way, you'll have the bee guards in place but will be able to see the hummingbirds a lot better, and you don't really need the flowers to attract the birds.  Do not put red dye or anything like that in the water, using it with clear sugar water (1 part sugar to 4 parts water) works great.  I've used this one all over and have been most happy with how it attracts birds.	1
Anna's Hummingbirds live year round in the San Francisco Bay Area.  For that reason, I need feeders that will last and also be attractive to the birds.  To ensure against leaks, make sure the "collars" on the flowers are rotated with the narrow section on top.  Be sure to push the collars in all the way.  Hummingbirds depend on sugar-rich nectar for up to 90 percent of their diet; the rest is made up of insects and pollen that provide essential protein.  Hummers need nectar for their survival.  For those that migrate in the fall, they need to double their body mass before the long trip.  Don't worry:  a hummingbird feeder will not prevent them from leaving.  They are hard-wired to migrate.  Hang several small feeders, such as this one, in different locations.  Best to keep them far apart so that one hummer doesn't try to guard all the feeders!  My three are located in my back yard, side yard, and front yard.  A big feeder could hang there for weeks before all of the nectar is consumed, which means the nectar would not be fresh.  Just as you need healthy fresh food, so do hummers.  Use sugar water:  combine four parts hot water to one part white sugar, stir, boil for one or two minutes, and allow to cool.  (Use a stainless steel pot.)  Never use honey (promotes growth of harmful bacteria) or red food coloring (not necessary to attract  the hummers).  You don't want red dye in your food and neither do hummers.  Hanging the feeders in the shade will discourage fermentation. Change the sugar water before it gets cloudy, twice a week in warm weather.  At the end of the week (or half week in warm weather), empty the unused nectar and start over with a clean feeder and fresh nectar.  Experiment with filling the feeder with less nectar if it is not consumed within a few days.  Clean the feeder every time you refill it:  one part white vinegar to four parts water.  The small brushes made for these feeders work well to remove dirt from the small parts.  I use a baby bottle brush inside the feeder.  Rinse the feeders three or four times with warm water and allow to air dry.  Thorough and regular cleaning keeps the feeders clean and also helps prevent the spread of avian diseases.  Ants!  You don't want them on your feeder.  Ants do not like chalk, so I use ordinary blackboard chalk to draw several rings around the shepherd's hook that holds the feeder.  I also use small reservoirs, filled with water, between the feeder and the hook.  The water can evaporate in a few days, so you need to check it at least twice a week.  Heavy rain can wash the chalk away.  Do not spread petroleum jelly on the hook, as it will contaminate the bird's feathers should he come into contact with the jelly.  Be vigilant with the reservoirs and the chalk rings!  I make up the nectar ahead of time and refrigerate it for up to one week in a clean mason jar.  Then when it's time to wash and refill the feeders, the nectar is ready.  Filling the feeder:  pour one cup of fresh nectar into a one-cup glass measuring cup.  Use a small funnel to fill the feeder.  Hang the feeder and enjoy watching the hummingbirds.	1
The hummingbirds seem to like this feeder.  A friend had one in CA and she had plenty of hummingbirds so I purchased one because they didn't seem to like the feeder I had.  Would come and look at it and then fly off.  While we don't have a lot of humming birds at our elevation, we did have hummers visit the Perky-Pet feeder each day and even sit on the perches and stay longer.  This feeder is easy to clean and completely comes apart to make it very easy to keep clean which is so important for the health of the hummers.	1
The old glass Perky Pet nectar feeder that still have is from the late 1980's or early 1990's. Hope this new "Perky Pet Glass Nectar Feeder" will last as long as that old feeder is lasting! With the construction being very similar i think it might. Differences being:new style has perches & new style has a threaded top & plastic cap where the old style did not have perches & it has a rubber cap & a grove in the top of bottle for a wire to hold the cap onto the bottle. The bee guards on the new feeder really do keep the bees out. If Looking for a glass nectar feeder that the hummers would like;this one by Perky Pet would be an excellent choice!	1
I had to buy a second one.  I have 15 hummingbirds fighting over this particular one.  I also have another feeder, but they don't care to use it. I use to just get excited over one hummingbird, but now I'm refilling this 8 oz. feeder 4 times a day. If it helps any, When I started my flower garden in my backyard I planted every flower or bush that would attract these hummingbirds, and this year it finally paid off.  Will show a video attached soon.	1
We've tried several multi-port feeders and this one works best for us. When the fall feeding starts, we have 6 of these out. The last 2 had rounded bee guards which pop open for cleaning. Very nice.	1
I had "neat" looking hummingbird feeders around with some success, but it was not until I hung this one that they started flocking in.  Don't know why, but it works.  feeder is of good quality and would order again.	1
I already have two of these feeders and have wasted money buying other feeders that are going to the Salvation Army. DO NOT waste your money on feeders that don't have a perch. The hummingbirds stay at a "perched" feeder longer. Right now I have 4 feeders and 20 - 30 hummingbirds. I had to rig a perch on the other two feeders and the hummers do not feed from them as much as these. Great price, great feeder.	1
I love this feeder... it is easy to clean. The hummers love it. I love it so we are all happy.. Have two of them and they both get utilized by the hummers.	1
A few weeks ago we helped my mother clean her garage and came across two of these feeders, both brand new and in their original boxes. Mom did not want them, so we gave one to a neighbor and brought the other one home.  Nothing happened for the first few days... we were initially a bit disappointed. Then, after two more days we noticed that the fluid level dropped a bit. Following directions, we emptied and cleaned the feeder at week's end and then refilled it -- and that is when the nectar carnage really started!  As week #2 of our feeder experience got underway, the feeder emptied in about four days and we began to see hummingbirds coming and going at all times of the day.  Guess the word got out!  Now, in the middle of the fourth week the feeder is emptying every 2.5 days or so.  We have wonderfully colored green, yellow, blue and kinda magenta hummingbirds flying around in singles and in pairs, and they are awesome to watch. They love this feeder, flying in to land on a perch and sipping until content, then buzzing right off.  Highly recommended!  Totally fascinating.	1
I have filled this up 3 times already. No humming birds but leaks slowly over the day. I have tried to readjust the lid and this did not help. I would not spend the money on this. I made a poor choice.	-1
I have been feeding hummingbirds for years and have tried several different feeders.  I now have two of these as they have been easier to deal with compared to others I have owned.	1
This feeder is half the size of my former glass feeder from Perky pet which means I can fill it with less sugar water. I also like the feeder flowers because the downey woodpeckers can't pull them off with their beaks. Those flowers are a bit hard to clean but all in all I am pleased with this feeder. Glass is much better than the plastics that sweat and dilute the water.	1
Like many of you I have tried them all. Big ones, short ones, flat ones, you name it. The Perky-Pet has worked the best for me. The birds really seem to like this style feeder. I like it because it only holds 8 ounces and I don't waste sugar water. I usually only have 2 or 3 birds and with the big feeders, the food would get icky even if I did not fill them up all the way. This holds just the right amount that the birds will eat before it gets that ickiness. No problems with ants or bees either. Finally, the perfect feeder!	1
We really enjoy the free show right outside our kitchen windows where we have hung two hummingbird feeders. We have visitors from dawn to dusk, though they tend to go take a nap on really hot sunny days - perhaps the nectar gets too warm to suit them. It's so interesting to watch the different feeding strategies - some hummers hover and dive in for quick sips; others perch on the foot rest and guzzle. It is rare to see 2 or more birds at the feeder at the same time as depicted in the illustration, since they are quite territorial, but it does occasionally happen. The birds seem to have learned who refills the feeder. Several times when I've been in the backyard weeding or watering, a hummer will hover right in front of my face, maybe 2 feet away, and make eye contact. I'm sure he's saying "hey lady, the feeding trough is empty!" Sometimes they buzz right by my head when I'm sitting out there reading. As I said, they're always entertaining :)  We have seen some bees on the yellow part of the flower, but not enough to be a nuisance. The major issue I have had with the feeder is the tendency to drip after you refill it. I always bring it indoors to clean it under hot running water, then refill with homemade nectar (4 parts water to 1 part sugar boiled briefly until the sugar dissolves). When I refill it in the kitchen sink and carry it outdoors I invariably dribble a little sugar water on the floor. Do you know how hard it is to clean up sticky sugar water from the floor? I should know by now that it would be better to refill it outdoors!  Others have criticized the plastic parts, which won't last forever, but at the price, I don't mind having to replace it every few years. I had an all glass feeder a few years ago which was quite a pretty piece of art, but I gradually broke off all the flowers and perches, and it only lasted about a year...	1
This 8 ounce glass hummingbird feeder is made very well.  I plan on ordering another one for the other patio door I have off the office.  It has an elegant look to it	1
This replaces a previous hummingbird feeder.  This one is much more superior than the one it replaced which cost more money.  It's easy to fill, the hanger was disappointing only because it was basically a wire and a little too short for my use, but overall, great product.	1
Great product. Well made. Shipped very well wrapped. Think I'm going to buy another one right now! Makes a great gift too!	1
My hummingbirds love this feeder the best!!  I have 3 different feeders and they drain this one first!!  Probably the Stand Up flowers that attracts them the most.  LOVE IT!!	1
This was priced very fair and packaged well.  I wouldn't think twice about doing business with this seller.  The feeder was well made and the 'hummers' love it.  Use it in Northern Wis.  just take the one hanging on the cabin in front of window down at night.  Seems the 'teenage' black bear enjoys it also.  Never had the problem before but I think he is just passing through the area.	1
To begin with, we have and use a very large number of feeders and have for years.  We have a very large number of different feeders which have been collected from here and there over the years.  We have been using this particular feeder in our arsenal for about six years now - as a matter of fact at present we have five or six of them in active use.  Like most things we purchase and use in life, there are good things and bad things about this particular feeder.  Nothing is perfect and nothing is absolutely bad and useless.  Most hummingbird feeders fall into the middle and probably one of the biggest problems with this feeder and other feeder is simply expectations.  Some folks set the bar very, very high, while others more or less are willing to take the bad a long with the good.  We personally fall into this category.  Now let's start with the positive:  First and foremost, and I feel the most important, is that these feeders do attract hummingbirds and the little guys seem to like them. During peek season we actually have trouble keeping all of our feeders filled on a daily basis, ergo, we rotate the filling and cleaning session.  Second, these feeders are extremely economical.  To maintain and use as many feeders as we have would be a major financial strain if we used only the high end feeders exclusively.  We have quite a number of these too, but hey there is only so much money in our household to devote to this one project.  Third, the four perches provided are a welcome addition and I feel is one of the big attractions causing high usage.  Forth, these feeders contain only 8 oz of nectar solution.  This "forces" me to continually check them and since we maintain so man feeders there is less likely hood of my getting "lazy" and not changing the unused (a rare occurrence) as often as I should.  There is less likelihood of cloudy and contaminated nectar.  fifth, these are easy to hang in various locations and in winder they are quite easy to store and do not take up all that much storage space.  Sixth, these are plastic and if you drop one, something that I frequently do, they will not shatter.  It is discouraging to drop a 20 or 30 dollar feeder and spend an hour making sure you get all the shatter glass cleaned up to say nothing of the loss of money.  Now the bottom side:  First, these are not "forever" feeders like most of the glass feeders we use.  They will over time, depending upon how much sun they get per day, deteriorate, become brittle and break.  We personally get from two to three years use out of each feeder but at that is an acceptable cost for us.  Second, yes, these things are just a bit more of a pain to clean than some of our other feeders.  We do need to use special little brushes and to do the job right, they must be completely disassembled.  This is not a great burden though and truth be told, I kind of enjoy the process and it gives me a chance to check everything out to make sure all is well.  Third, the bee guard is not 100 percent effective.  Small bees can and do get into the feeders and the guards are completely useless as to the ants we have here.  On the other hand I find that a coating of Vaseline to the wire holding the feeder pretty well stops the ant problem and since these things are being constantly cleaned and refilled the few bees that do get in, while unsightly, are not that great a problem.  All in all, for us, the positives far outweigh the negative.  Is this the only feeder we use?  No, most certainly not.  I took a look the other day and we have about 10 different feeders in use at this time.  By the end of the summer we will have more when the birds become more active.  Is this be very, very best feeder we have?  No, but they price wise and effective wise they serve their purpose quite well.  We are quite satisfied with this feeder and will continue using them as long as they are available.  Don Blankenship The Ozarks	1
I have several hummer feeders and about half of them are this one, which I consider one of the best.  My only admonition is to clean it regularly and systematically, lest it become fouled with algae and other crud.  Of course, this is something we hummer aficionados should do any way, right?	1
UPDATE 8/12/13 - My little hummers absolutely LOVE this one!  They have it empty every few days (I checked and it is NOT leaking!)  I've only seen three hummers at once but all day I hear them buzzing round and round the house which is just adorable!  I took it down to clean it yesterday and a little guy stopped by and was watching me through the kitchen window waiting for it to come back out.  I hurried up!  I'm not sure what is so different from the 16-ounce version but this one is a hit with the little guys!  :)  It's too bad that the seasons are changing soon and they will be gone until next spring!  :(  I had the Perky Pet Pinch Waist Glass 16-Ounce Hummingbird Feeder for many, many years.  It served me well but the squirrels kept pulling off the little yellow flowers so I had to keep replacing them.  I finally put duct tape over three of the holes and just used one.  You can imagine how awful that looked!  I don't get too many little guys so I decided to purchase a smaller version of my old one which is this 8 ounce one.  The little guys love it and so far Mr. Squirrel has left it alone!  It's nice and bright in color so the hummingbirds can find it easily and I really like that it has perchs for them to sit and stay for a little bit.  The smaller size is perfect and it's very easy to clean and fill.  I like that it's glass and not plastic so it's much sturdier.  I did have to get a smaller funnel than the one that I had but they are very inexpensive.  The old one I tried using was had a 1/4" opening and it was just a wee bit too small to fill this one.  Overall this feeder is absolutely perfect and I'm sure it will last for many years like my other Perky-Pet feeder did!  :)	1
I haven't used the feeder yet. This is an out of the box review. But I have used this type of feeder successfully in the past so that was a good part of deciding on this one. It is very well built, with nice sturdy plastic and a thick glass water bottle. It is a very good price. It would have received a 5 if it had an ant guard. I will see how it does this summer and do a follow up review.	1
I used Perky Pet feeders for many years and was always satisfied, however they must have changed their quality control people because the ones they sell now are junk. If you just screw the bottle on to the base snugly, they leak, and if you try to tighten them they twist off and have to be discarded. The flowers and the wasp guards do not stay on after a couple of washings and have to be glued on.	-1
I have always used this particular type of feeder for my Hummers.  My only complaint is that the bases do not last as long as the bottle and Perky Pet charges almost as much (if you include the shipping charge) as it costs for a whole new feeder. Therefore I am forced to either throw away perfectly good feeder bottles that could still be used or spend as much on the replacement base as I would on a new feeder. I have three bottles right now sitting unused under my kitchen sink that could be outside but for the fact that I can not being myself to pay for the replacement base.	1
How can you ask for more than a device that is simple, inexpensive and works.  The Hummers came to the feeder within minutes of hanging it the feeder pole.  My only suggestion is to buy the larger version.  I mix my own nectar with a 1 to 4 ratio.	1
While I try to always keep plenty of flowering vines and plants around that are hummingbird favorites, I also make sure to keep nectar feeders available throughout the entire hummer season.  They always seem to show a preference for certain natural flowers; but there are many stretches of time when they're feeding solely from the feeders.  Several years ago, someone suggested to me that I put out my hummingbird feeders earlier in the spring (early to mid-March here). The male hummingbirds arrive earlier than the females in order to find an ideal feeding and nesting spot.  This gives them a leg-up (wing-up?) on the other males in wooing the females when they finally arrive. Well, I did as suggested and it worked! For the past three years, we have ended up with a nest in our large crape myrtle tree at the end of the porch. It's been fun to watch as the babies begin to fly and drink at the feeder. Hummingbirds are devilish little things...quite territorial and aggressive (even with their siblings). Because of this territorial nature, I've had to hang an extra feeder to reduce the squabbles. Hummingbird habits may vary by region or type, but having the multiple feeding holes on each of the feeders has been unnecessary since they fight each other off and usually only one bird will feed at a time.  I've been using this feeder in addition to the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Aspects-429-Hummzinger-Highview-Feeder/dp/B003XL7WZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Aspects 429 Hummzinger Highview Feeder</a>.  While the Aspects model offers the advantage of slightly better visibility of the birds when feeding, this Perky-Pet Pinch Waist feeder has one difference that I find very beneficial.  Because it's important to not leave nectar in the feeders for more than 2-3 days during very hot weather due to spoilage and bacteria build-up, this model by Perky-Pet is considerably less wasteful of the nectar.  With the Aspects model, you must fill the feeder up to a fairly high level in order for the hummingbirds' beaks to reach down through the hole to access the nectar.  However, with this Pinch Waist style, I can pour just an inch or two into the bottle at a time (rather than filled nearly all the way to the top as seen in the product page photo).  When the bottle is inverted, even that small amount of nectar is immediately available for feeding.  As a result, I'm not having to regularly throw out and replace old nectar.  I just put in however much nectar they'll eat in 2-3 days time and then rinse the bottle with hot water and add more nectar.  It seems to be the  birds' favorite feeder, too, since it appears to receive much more hummer traffic than the other one.	1
This hummingbird feeder is easy to fill and hang.  It attracts a lot of humming birdss who seem to love to perch on the small rests in front of each serum delivery "flower".  It fits the bill, or in this case beak!	1
This is the favorite for my hummers. While it is a bit difficult to clean, it holds up year after year and doesn't discolor.	1
MY ORIGINAL REVIEW WAS 3 STARS.  I STATED THAT IT WAS CHEAPLY MADE BUT FAIR FOR THE PRICE.  WITHOUT SOLICITATION FROM ME, THE COMPANY WROTE ME AND FOLLOWED UP.  PRETTY AMAZING AS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW WAS 3 STARS, NOT TOO BAD.  BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE A COMPANY WHO WORKS THIS HARD TO MAKE SURE THE CUSTOMER IS SATISFIED WITH THEIR PRODUCT. HAVE BEEN USING THE FEEDER FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW AND IT WORKS FINE.	1
I've tried two other feeders and this one I have found to be the best one yet! The biggest problem I have now is too many hummingbirds fighting over the feeder. Great choice and I'm contemplating on getting another for the front of the house.	1
looks great hanging on my window. just to early for the hummingbirds to come a calling here in madison, wisconsin. hope it'll be busy soon.	1
Where I live, the bees will take over a hummingbird feeder; the bee guards on this really work, and the feeder does not leak.  It holds just the right amount of nectar to put out, without it going bad.  This feeder is worth every penny.	1
The pros: + Reasonably priced & free shipping was included. + Small 8oz size, with a nice shape... easier to hold on to! + Hardened glass + Removable perch. + Hanging wire is included. + Small size = easier cleaning & fresher nectar. + We haven't noticed any nectar dipping out of the feeder.  The cons: - The attachment screw for the removable perch is steel, I upgraded ours to stainless steel. - The first feeder had to be returned, as one of the yellow bee guards was missing. The Amazon return process was very easy & I had the replacement within 2 days. Now that's customer service!   Our homemade nectar: To make a batch of homemade nectar, we add 1/4 cup of regular sugar to 1 cup of boiling water. We use a 2 cup measuring cup, filtered tap water & 3 minutes in our microwave gets the water to a fast boil. Pour in the 1/4 cup of sugar, stir & let it cool. This is the exact amount needed to fill the 8oz feeder. We decided not to color the nectar, as most say it's not necessary.   Our cleaning routine: The cleaning is very easy & should be done at each refilling. While the freshly made nectar is cooling, we prewarm, then fill the glass bottle with boiling hot water & let it sit. No need to scrubing the inside of the bottle. Next we pull off the bee guards & set them in the sink to be cleaned by pouring boiling hot water on & thru them. The last item to clean is the base & perch. You guessed it, more boiling hot water is used to flush everything clean. No need to pull anything apart, the boiling hot water will get to all the nooks & crannies. Cleaning = piece-of-cake! :)   Notes:  It's easy to tell when the feeder is completely empty, as the Hummingbirds will move from one flower to the next testing each flower for nectar.  It disturbs the Hummingbirds to remove the feeder for refilling, so we do this now after dark. When we did this during the day, one Hummingbird would come within a couple feet to investigate!   Update - April 8, 2013 The Hummingbirds have started visiting our feeder, so I've upgraded our product rating to 5! :)   Update - April 28, 2013 We have regular vistors now & it's a real treat to have the Hummingbirds frequent our feeder. The formula we're using seems to be perfect, as the Hummingbirds love it! Not want wanting to be without a feeder, we decided to buy a spare one... just in case ours needs to be replaced.   Update - May 15, 2013 When the "spare" feeder was delivered, we were surprised to see the bee guards had been redesigned. Instead of the square shape, the bee guard is now rounded... a more realistic flower shape. Today we installed those bee guards & right away we noticed the Hummingbirds spending less time probing & more time perched & feeding. Yes, the improved shape is a winner in our book!   Update - November 24, 2013 We never realized Hummingbirds stayed around our area this late in the year. We don't get as many vistors, but they do come by, so we make sure the feeder is kept filled.   Update - November 29, 2013 - A problem & a solution!  It's getting cold now & there's a problem with the nectar freezing! I had to use a hair dryer to melt the ice that had formed. This worked, but I decided a better solution was needed. I wired up a single red 7 watt, C7 incandescent indicator bulb (like a Christmas or nightlight bulb) & attached it to the glass (touching) with Velcro ties. This keeps the nectar in the upper forties when the air temperature is below freezing. I have a red bulb installed & the red light doesn't look bad at all, especially at night! I'd post some picture, but this listing doesn't allow pictures to be posted. :(  We noticed that the Hummingbirds perch on the side that has the bulb, so we think they enjoy the heat given off by the bulb as they feed.  The temperature has dipped to 10F & there's no ice forming on lower part of the feeder. The heat from the small 7 watt bulb can't keep the entire feeder ice free when the temperatures are too low. We notice the Hummingbirds like to sit near the light to keep warm while sipping nectar.   Update - November 12, 2014 - problem found + fix!  While doing a thorough cleaning inside of the feeder, I found one of the ports that allow nectar to be accessed was partially blocked? The blockage was caused by plastic flashing that wasn't removed from the plastic molding process. The fix was easy, just cut out the thin flashing with a knife tip to match the other ports.  When I checked our second feeder, it had the exact same issue!  Now I know why the Hummingbirds weren't feeding out of all the ports. :)	1
I like it!  A good, cheap, inexpensive feeder.  We bought two so we could watch the hummingbirds flying between them.	1
I've had several Perky Pet hummingbird feeders over the years.  They do attract hummingbirds but are notorious to keep clean.  I mix my own nectar and maintain my feeders on a weekly basis.  It got to be such a chore with the Perky Pet feeders I almost gave up.  Then I heard a local hummingbird expert mention the Dr. JB feeder.  Now it's the only hummingbird feeder I recommend.  So simple to fill and clean.  A much better choice for me.	-1
My old feeders were getting brittle.. The perches were starting to break so I found these on Amazon & ordered it.	1
Took a while, but the humming birds finally found the feeder.  I'm hoping we're on next years rotation and they tell their friends.  I had no idea humming birds were attracted to red...	1
LOVE this hummingbird feeder AND SO DO THE HUMMINGBIRDS!!! Easy maintenance, even for those who are not gardeners or birdwatchers. The hummingbirds stop in for a drink in the mornings AND come back in the evenings! I have bought several for friends and neighbors.	1
The hummingbirds just love this thing! It is very simply designed and the top is glass which makes it very easy to clean. Also, I rubbed a little vegetable oil on the "petals" of the feeder to keep out wasps and it seems to have worked well. I even see a very small, miniature-type hummingbirds feeding on this. Perhaps, it is baby hummingbirds? Anyway, I just love watching the birds use this feeder and it is easy to keep clean.	1
This double set, humming bird acquifier and ant feeder is a wonderful addition to any senior citizen's home. Sitting in your air conditioned porch and watching birds of all distinction taste the syrupy flavor that comes out of the spout will make anyone go wild, unless you are blind.	1
I've tried other feeders and I keep coming back to this one. It just works and it's easy to use. The plastic parts are sturdy and help keep it lightweight; the part that holds the food is glass. Be careful not to screw the base (plastic) on too tight or you can crack it; just tighten slightly. You'll want a good brush to clean the inside and the small parts. Ants can find this, so get an ant guard for sure.  At least one bee manages to get inside once every season and die, clouding up the water, so watch for that. I've had other kinds of birds land on this to get a drink, especially with the drought we've had in Texas.  The photo shows red liquid, but the birds are attracted to the red of the flower parts themselves, so you can save money by making your own hummingbird food. I got this recipe from a hummingbird site:  Mix 1/4 c. granulated sugar with 3/4 c. boiling water, cool. It's the perfect size for this feeder. Must change the water every few days, or within a week because it will go bad.	1
I guess I am speaking for the Hummingbirds here, but my hummers prefer Perkey feeders and I don't even know why.  I have tried other brands and I always go back to buying perky's because those are the feeders that my birds seem to congregate around.  They will ignore the others and always fight to use the Perky's.  So, there you have it.  A testimonial from Michigan hummingbirds.	1
We ordered two from Amazon based upon the reputation of the company and pictures presented. Totally disappointed with the total lack of quality. The price is low because of the low quality of materials used. Bottomline is that a 'good' feeder cannot be purchased at this price. The units purchased leaked the sugar water all over our patio. The unit can be sold as an ant feeder. We returned the units.	-1
I have had several feeders and have always had a problem with dripping..I bought cheap ones and expensive ones and always ended up giving them away or throwing them away well I found this one at target and liked that it was smaller with the bee guards and best of all it did not leak! Well being new to the hummingbird feeding I did not realize how territorial they were..I thought they were being playful..I went back to Target and got found another(BTW it was $12.99 at Target) but it was missing a bee guard while in the store I called the 800 number on the product and they said they would send me a new one so I went ahead and got it...4 days later I got the guards in the mail..anyway now I have 3 I am such a sucker and feel bad for all the hummingbirds and their little hummingbird wars but they are fun to watch...I have since found some small single feeders that I have spaced out on the cyclone fence but they do drip a little so have have to angle them and refill them daily but at least some it gives more hummingbirds a chance to drink ...it is migrating season and I went from 1 or 2 hummingbirds last year to it seems like 30 or more..love the little chittering the do from the trees and how they stand guard watching over their feeders	1
Used same feeder for several years. The two I ordered were replacements. They do wear/break but only after several years of heavy use and hot weather.	1
I bought this feeder and the Hummzinger for our backyard.  After a month, the verdict is in: Hummers prefer the Perky-Pet. I've had to refill this one three times while the Hummzinger remains half full.	1
First, I will not use feeders with the perch that circles the feeder.  In my search for the 'perfect' feeder, I found an article with a very sad picture of a dead hummer trapped in between the perch and the feeder.  So I tried some without perches, OK, but I like to see them able to perch and rest while feeding.  Also found 2 or three types that leaked badly.  So all in all this is the best I have found and is now all that I use.  I just have one question, where do they get those pictures of 4 hummers all feeding happily together?  LOL  Mine spend more time chasing each other away than eating, and I have 3 of them placed some distance apart.	1
I own this feeder & the hummingbirds prefer this one over the "Aspects" model. I have tried switching them around but they still prefer the Perky-Pet feeder. It is made in the USA. UPDATE: Some hummingbirds use both type of feeders now & some prefer the "Aspects" feeder. I can't figure out hummingbirds too well.	1
I am very disappointed in this feeder.  I've only had it for 45 days and it leaks a lot.  I guess I'm a whole 15 days pass the period I can return this poor quality bird feeder.  I hope something can be done about this.	-1
True - there are a lot of parts to this feeder, yet of all the feeders I've tried so far, this is one that hasn't leaked like a sieve in the wind.  Of all the feeders I've hung out, this one with the big flowers and the little perches is the hummies' favorite for some reason.  The yellow grid bee guards (along with a Perky Pet AntGuard) has been deterring our bees without killing them.  I had heavy swarms of bees hanging on the old feeders and many crawled into the reservoirs and died.  Now, they smell the nectar, can't get to it through the bee guards, give up, and don't come back. And the hummies are very crafty about getting their long tongues through the yellow grid of the bee guards to drink.  Sometimes they sit and rest for a long while, then resume sipping again.  Some even sit two to a perch while taking turns drinking! Also, I went online to get replacement parts for this feeder - every part of this feeder is replaceable - cap, wire, screw, perch, bottle, flowers, bee guards, base, insert - plus I bought two more new pinch-waist feeders to rotate around so that I always have a clean, dry feeder available for the next fill-up. It took a lot of trial-and-error styles to finally come up with a workable feeder to hang on our 4-arm yard pole.  This feeder also comes in a less expensive plastic bottle but I like the heavier glass bottle because it's more stable in the wind. Most reviews on this pinch-waist were so good that I chanced the purchase and will not use anything else now. Actually, the hummies' preference for this feeder over other styles was also an important factor for getting more.	1
A previous reviewer noted it is a cheaper and gaudy feeder, but there are 3 to 1 more hummingbirds at this feeder than the other models I own. I've had to replace the yellow bee guards after 3 years of use, but they are readily available for $5.79 here on Amazon. Dissembles easily for cleaning. I have an electric water boiling kettle and use boiling water to clean the parts. I think the hummingbirds like the flower openings facing to the side versus up. Here in Texas there are very few flowers because of the drought, so between my Mexican Firebushes and these feeders I need an air traffic controller in my back yard.	1
I have had several feeders that leak or the hummers don't like it including the Aspects 153 & 367 models.  I admit the Aspect model are easier to clean but if the birds don't care for it...  I live in Florida where hummers at my location are not large as in Texas and Cal.  So the size is better for refilling here.  Bees are not a problem here  and the yellow bee guards do not draw them to the feeder.  In fact, I cut small hole in the guards so the hummers could feed easier and also I liked the contrast of yellow because I could have taken them off completely. As for the color you could paint them with hobby shop paint or just nail polish.  Anyhow, I like it and the birds like it what else do you need.	1
These are very decent hummingbird feeders. They definitely get the birds attention and attract them in. The problem is, they attract bees and wasps as well. They do have bee guards, but they aren't very effective, imo. That said, it does appear to be one of the hummingbirds feeder of choice. I have more than a half a dozen different makes and models of hummingbird feeders in my yard, and have hundreds of visits per day, and this one gets as much, if not more attention, than the others. Again, I agree with those who mention the downside of these feeders, but, I'll always have one of them in my yard, despite its lack of being perfect. For the price, imo, it's a must have for any hummingbird enthusiast.  If you do have too many wasps being attracted to this feeder, try the following:  [...]  Rather than using duct tape, as suggested in the link to hold the wasp trap together (What were they thinking? Maybe they use it as a "fix all" solution, who knows?) Rather, staple the sides of the bottle together, add "wasp bait", a 3 to 1 mixture of water and sugar does the trick, filling about half of the trap (and make sure that some liquid is spilled onto the top of the trap to attract them. Then, punch or drill two holes towards the top of the trap, add string, twine or part of an old wire hanger, so that you can hang it up near your hummingbird feeder (or, simply place it near the feeder on the ground). I recommend using an old Mountain Dew bottle, as the green color really attracts the wasps, away from your hummingbird feeder. I've used these traps, and you'll be surprised how many wasps that you'll catch, they really work well!	1
haven't used it yet. want to put up a "HANGER ROD" in my flower garden. procrastinating!! THANX	1
I hung this feeder up after filling it with one cup of water mixed with 1/4 cup of table sugar. The next day I was out watering my garden and had hummingbirds buzzing around me! I retreated indoors and not more than a minute passed before a bird landed on the built-in perch and started filling up. Today I was kneeling next to my garden and one of the birds hovered only a few feet from my face in between drinks! If you're scared of various things you may want to mount this further from human usage areas but for me it's thrilling to get such a close look.  My opinion of this feeder is that hummingbirds immediately recognize it as a food source with non-colored liquid and use it all throughout the day. The bad things about it are that the parts that screw together fit poorly and there is not a feeling of a positive connection. It hasn't leaked yet though so it's just the feel that I'm uncomfortable with. Also, I have large black ants that are walking around inside the yellow 'bee guard' caps in the flowers so I will spread some tanglefoot on the post it is hanging from.  My first fill up has lasted about a week in high heat and heavy feeding so it's big enough yet nicely compact. It holds exactly 1 cup of liquid. I am here today to put another one in my cart since I see hummingbirds flying around on the other side of the house and I want to feed them wherever they are in my yard since they eat bugs but not my fruit. They are also uniquely entertaining when they fly near me or even when I hear them coming.	1
I have 4 different styles of feeders and this one attracts the hummers most often. It's easy to fill and clean, so I'm pretty happy with this feeder and will definitely buy another if something should happen to it.	1
I love hummingbirds.  They are wonderful acrobats, as anyone who as seen one will attest.  And I've gotten buzzed a few times myself.  This is my basic, all-purpose hummingbird feeder.  It's glass with a plastic feeder bottom.  It holds about a cup of sugar water.  No dye is necessary, and the hummers thrive on a pure sugar diet.  It cleans nicely (I use a small bottle brush), it holds enough for a week's worth of food, and it goes up easily.  It includes what are billed as bee guards.  I don't have a problem with bees, so sometimes I just leave them off.  And the bee guards are the only thing that I consider a problem with this product; the guards are very hard to clean.  If mildew gets on them, it the devil's business in cleaning them off.  So I just don't often use them.  Highly recommended.  Perky Pet has a winner here!  Four-and-a-half stars for the Pinch Waist Hummingbird feeder.	1
Hummingbirds immediately responded.  It is fun, and therapeutic for me. Despite a jerky neighbor, the device is wonderful for city dwellers with any type balcony or sitting area.	1
Very bright and really attracts the hummingbirds.  Before I hung it up I would see a hummingbird once a year; now I've seen two at a time on the feeder.  I do have a problem with the feeder, viz., it's a bit tough to clean, and I do need to clean it as it's close to other bird feeders.  However, I would definitely buy it again.  I've been using sugar water (2 pts water, 1 part sugar), refilling once a week.	1
I hadn't put out a feeder for several years, but a little green hummer kept bopping over the the patio this past week whenever I was outside.  He'd hover and dart around the chimes and lights, making it obvious that he was looking for a feeder.  So ... I ordered two of these because I wanted some that were small, affordable and had a bee guard. Thanks to Amazon, they arrived very fast and my little hummingbird has already found it.  He's happy and I'm no longer feeling guilty. These are easy to fill and just the size I wanted.	1
Well, despite what Mr. One-Star Review says, we've used Perky Pet Hummingbird feeders for years (dare I say decades) and love them.  More importantly the Hummingbirds seem to like them.  And do get the one with perches!  For regardless of what the sources tell you about the high energy levels of Hummers, when we've had feeders with and without perches, they use the latter more.  I mean, who doesn't like to rest for a spell.  As to accessories: Skip the special food.  You can make your own 'nectar' by using 1-part regular sugar (not honey or brown sugar) to 4-parts tap water.  You boil the water briefly to drive off chlorine, then dissolve the sugar thoroughly.  (Don't boil too long, you'll mess up the 1-to-4 ratio.)  After the solution cools, you can then dye the sugar water red with regular household food dye.  BUT do buy more bee guards.  They are cheap and should be replaced every season as apparently Hummingbird spit is pretty disgusting, and the guards will get a mold that might not be entirely cleansed away and might make the birds sick next season.  Finally, do take one of the bee guards off.  We have a chickadee who has been coming for several years, who apparently has a sweet-beak.  It's funny to see him line up with the rest of our tiny friends.  And whether you go low-end like this one, or high-end like some might steer you, make sure that you keep everything reasonable clean.  This is someone's kitchen afterall.  Regards!  Pam T~	1
I have tried many feeders but Perky Pet is the  best.  Sometimes I have 10 hummers trying to feed at the same time.	1
I have two of these feeders and yes... they aren't the easiest to clean... but so far this is by far my favorite feeder, and I've tried many.  The hummingbirds love it, and with an ant guard on top it stays very clean.  I bought a tiny bottle brush and bent it in a 90 degree angle, and it works just fine on cleaning the bottle's tough-to-get-at shape.  I too have used the saucer shaped feeders, and while the hummingbirds loved it, so did the squirrels.  During the really hot, drought months, I would see squirrels hanging off the thing, emptying it of all the nectar.  Who knew squirrels would drink that stuff... but they do.  They also broke the perch off in several places on the saucer model.  So far, they have left this one alone.	1
I have always liked this feeder. The perches allow them to sit & drink, giving you a good look at them.  The 8 oz is nice since the feeders should be cleaned once a week.  I used to have large feeders but I could never get more than one Hummer to feed at a time.  They will drive others away while they feed.  I sure do enjoy seeing these aggressive little "puppies". Perky Pet Feeders are well made & parts are available if you break part of it.  Janet Witman	1
This double set, humming bird acquifier and ant feeder is a wonderful addition to any senior citizen's home. Sitting in your air conditioned porch and watching birds of all distinction taste the syrupy flavor that comes out of the spout will make anyone go wild, unless you are blind.	1
Attracted several hummingbirds all summer. Used natural sugar and water solution (1 part cane sugar to 4 parts water). You'll need a bottle brush and a pack of pipe cleaners to keep it clean once a week.	1
We and other family members have tried various hummingbird feeders through the years, and we always come back to this type.  Get the glass tube and this type of flowers where the hummingbirds feed!  Hummingbirds seem to like it the best, it's the easiest I've had to clean (with a small brush), and lasts the longest.  I'm now buying them as gifts for other people.	1
I have had one of these for about ten years and only purchased another because the bees started robbing it and had lost the bee gaurds. Hummers have no trouble getting past them but bees and finches are kept out. The bottom is easy to overtighten and strip so some care must be taken there. Tighten until the threads just bottom out and it should last for years. Only real drawback is it's kind of a pain to clean inside of bottle because of the shape.	1
The feeders were great and my Hummingbirds (50 to 60) are enjoying them.  They have eaten 20 pounds of sugar so far.	1
The little humming birds love this feeder so much I can hardly keep it full!  So wonderful to see God's little helicopters.  Isn't His creation wonderful?	1
I've tried all kinds of hummingbird feeders and I keep coming back to this because of the bee guards.  Without these, and this is about the only one I know of with these, at least this type, you attract ALL KINDS OF BEES so bad sometimes the hummer can't get a word in edge wise.  The guards are a pain cause sometimes they fall off and get lost or you just have to keep putting them back, but you can get replacements and this one works good.  Kind of hard to clean, but overall if you want to attract hummers with a reliable performer, this is it.	1
This is a very good item for helping to keep your hummingbird feeders clean---an absolute must for the health of hummingbirds.  You can insert this mop cleaner into the feeders that have bottlenecks and it will help get out the mold that inevitably forms. Be sure to rinse the mop thoroughly after cleaning.  I find that these mops usually last for a season or two, but graduallly they will come apart and need to be replaced.  Overall they work very well.  Another good item to get is&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Droll-Yankees-PLB-Perfect-Little-Brush/dp/B00004ZB4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Droll Yankees PLB Perfect Little Brush</a>.  These little brushes are the best for cleaning the holes of feeding ports.	1
These mops work great. Easy to get inside the feeder to wash it clean. The wire could be a little heavier but they still work well. I keep coming back for more. They do a great job.	1
Wonderful, I love these cleaners.	1
Works great!	1
This works really well when I clean my feeders.  I just hope that it lasts as it is not as sturdy as the brush style.	1
This thing sucks don't last long sponge is very cheap	-1
Cheaply made but it pretty much works. I think it should have more "fingers" as I have some bare spots and have to really swish and swish to get feeders clean. Which is better?...brush or sponge?/...both pretty much work the same. Buy both, all are inexpensive and clean feeders till you're satisfied.	1
Very efficient way to clean feeder bottles	1
This is really just a little junky.  I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it.	-1
Bad. They were all dried up.  I had one before and it was great but these were terrible	-1
I love the mop for my larger feeders. I had ordered it for my smaller feeders that are very difficult to clean. This was too large for that. I also squeezed the mop end with pliers to keep the foam from sliding out.	1
Brushes work as advertised and fit into a small neck bottle to clean the insidies of cloudy deposits.	1
If you have hummingbird feeders, you know how hard it is to clean them!  These work perfectly!	1
I have used quite a few of these, I am pleased with the product because it gets through the small opening of the glass feeders that I have and I am able to clean the sides of the feeders.	1
not worth the price I payed for it.	-1
works great for humming bird feeders. And any other narrow open bottles1	1
didn't last very long	-1
Luv, luv, luv this handy little sponge! I didn't buy it for my hummer feeders. I bought it to clean squirt top bottles that have openings too small for any other type of long-handled scrubber/sponge cleaners. NOTE: the sponge strips are held in place by metal prongs. I recommend using a pair of pliers to tighten down the clamps just a bit to secure the strips even better.	1
Was able to use this in a very narrow opening to my bird feeder! Cleaned very well	1
came on time just as shows	1
So far so good.  It cleans the feeders well and hasn't fallen apart yet (about 6 weeks).	1
Works great for cleaning the inside of narrow mouthed Humming Bird feeder.  Crimping the wire as described by another reviewer was very helpful.	1
it is what it shows	1
This is exactly what my wife was looking for to clean her humming bird feeders.	1
It really does clean the inside of the bird feeders. Works ok	1
Hate it.  This mop began ok, but after about 3 months, it started unraveling the sponges from the end, so I pitched it.	-1
I had to trim the foam to fit into the hummer feeders but not a problem.  Mop works great and gets rid of any mold, etc.	1
AOK	1
A great little brush when it comes to clean up it will mop up like no others and it'll have you foaming at the mouth wanting to clean more!	1
I never knew this cleaning tool existed until I saw it on amazon.com.  It is worth every penny.  I had an old hummingbird feeder that wasn't coming clean with just soaking in soapy water.  Wit the cleaning mop, it is getting squeaky clean every time.  Great product.	1
You pay for item you get. In other words, it was cheap and it fell apart, but after fixing it, gave up and bought a higher price one that cleaned also.	-1
This thing looks awfully fragile (hence 4 stars), but it works well in my big Best 1 feeders.  So far, so good!	1
Perfect for maintaining my Perky-Pet 210P small neck feeder.	1
love this mop.  now I can get down in the container and make sure it is properly cleaned,makes keeping the feeders nice and clean	1
Before I got this I had a really hard time cleaning my perky pet hummingbird feeder. This is just the thing you need for those bottles with tiny mouths.	1
I have used these for years to clean my perky pet pinch waist feeders.  The feeders have a small opening and there is nothing else  I have found that will get inside and clean them except this product.  I wet the "mop" before using it, and it works very well-- for a while.  I always buy several, as they will not last forever.  The foam product at the end of the mop will start to fall apart, eventually.  It would probably last someone with one or two feeders an entire season, but I have 6 or 7 feeders going, so it usually needs to be replaced twice a season.  I will definately buy this product again.  FYI,  I've found out pipe cleaners are great to clean out the  the feeding ports in the bottom of the feeder.	1
Perky-Pet 23T Bird Feeder Foam Cleaning Mop is the best cleaner I have used. It cleans my bottles easily and I can see how clean it gets. The bristles don't always get the gunk but this one does.	1
These foam cleaning mops are able to squeeze into the small openings of most humming bird feeders.  I use them to keep the feeders free of harmful mold.	1
This "mop" is too flimsy and too short.  The foam pieces will come out if you don't take a pair of pliers and pinch the metal ring that holds them tighter together.  It also bends very easily.	-1
I have a 16-oz. Perky-Pet hummingbird feeder and purchased this mop to clean it out.  Well, it's too short to reach the bottom of the feeder.  You'd think the manufacturer would have checked this out.  Needs to be another 1.5" long.	-1
This is a simple product and design, but a regular bottle washer doesn't fit some of the hummingbird bottle feeders.  The thin wire and sponge material fit easily into the bottle making it possible to clean any residue.  You need to wet the sponge as directed before forcing it into the bottle dry (or it might tear upon being forced).  The only reason I didn't rate this a 5 is because it is just a little too short to reach all the way to the bottom of the feeder bottle.  To avoid any mold developing that is difficult to reach, I might suggest avoiding completely filling the bottle with nectar.	1
There are many reviews for this brush on Amazon that trash it for coming apart too quickly, yet I have one which has lasted me for years. The solution is simple. The new brushes sometimes arrive with the metal loop around the foam insufficiently clamped shut, which allows the foam to pull free. Simply inspect the brush on arrival and, if necessary, crimp the metal loop around the foam shut with a pliers before using your new brush. Problem solved!  I am taking the time to write this review because this is a fine, long-lasting brush, and the only one I have found that cleans not only my feeder's bottles, but also their bases (via entry through the slots in the bases).  BTW, I use Perky Pet's '209 Our Best 30-Ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeders,' and I truly do consider them Best. Their large size allows me to re-fill them less frequently (although I get so many hummers they can empty one in a day). Please ..... spend a bit more and get a quality glass feeder, don't waste your money on the acrylic ones. A glass feeder will last you longer, will not discolor, and will keep the nectar within more cool and fresh for a longer period of time. Your hummers will thank you for it.  Finally, don't waste your money buying nectar when a solution of one part sugar in four parts water (3/4 cup sugar in 3 cups water, for example) makes perfect nectar. I like to boil my nectar for a few minutes and then re-stir it to ensure the sugar is fully dissolved, then I simply allow it to cool. Also, please do not add red food coloring to your nectar since it is completely unnecessary for attracting hummers, and is not healthy for them.  Enjoy your birds, and all the rest of our Creator's MARVEL-ous creation!	1
The Perky-Pet foam cleaning mop was what I needed to clean my class feeder, needed to remove some black mold spots and it did a great job quickly.  My hummingbirds are now eating from a mold free source.	1
I could not believe the poor quality of this brush. It was made in the USA but not of the expected high quality of other USA made products I have purchased recently. A piece of wire and a few spongy looking strips add up to a waste of money. This loser came apart during first use. After throwing this piece of junk away I went to the Dollar Tree and for a single buck got a multi-purpose brush that looks like a Rolls Royce compared to this Perky Pet jalopy. I have been a Perky Pet fan but if this is what they are putting out these days I will become an ex-fan. If you have access to a Dollar Tree go get a brush that will do what this brush does and much more all for a single dollar.	-1
I have been using these mops for cleaning the bird feeder for years and they usually last quite a bit longer.  I don't know why they are falling apart very quickly and the mop sponge part does not feel sturdy at all like they used to.  COME ON PERKY-PET start making a good product again!!!!!!  If I remember right seems they used to be made out of actual sponge material instead of this foam garbage.	-1
These work well when new.  But quickly disintegrate and are useless after a few uses.  I find nylon brushes are the only things that work for any extended period of time.	-1
This is advertised often as a non-scratching bird feeder cleaning mop. I like most Perky Pet products but this mop does not work for me as it was advertised. The clump of sponge strings are mounted at the end of a metal handle that will not fit into the Perky Pet 8oz pinch-waist bottle neck. The sponge strings bunch up at the bottom of the mop and do not fit through smaller bottle necks. Also, the metal that is at the sponge end WILL scratch anything it touches - it scratched a plastic bottle I used it on. I had to catalog order from a different manufacturer a long, narrow, soft-bristled brush to fit into my narrow neck feeder bottle. The mop doesn't fit into any of my feeder bases either. As for cleaning the feeder bases, I soak them in a bleach solution, then rinse well, and thoroughly air-dry.	-1
I had looked a long time for a decent way to clean out the skinny-necked hummingbird feeders I keep.  When I bought the Perky-Pet 23T, I hoped my dreams had come true. Imagine how my dreams crushed to the ground like bits of broken black-oil sunflower seed when on the second use -- the 23T fell apart, like clouds separating in the wind.  I do give the item one star, since I used it successfully once.  But the design is embarrassingly ill-configured: a metal hoop into which the spongy is just stuffed.  Or at least that's what I could tell when the two pieces fell apart upon the second use.  I hadn't jammed roughly, hadn't bashed or jumbled or crushed or any other harsh actions.  On the second occasion -- I pulled the thing out after gently washing, and the sponge and the metal holder were in two unrelated places.  Not to be totally negative, I plan on tying a piece of cotton onto the remaining metal "hook" and making do from there.  Maybe I'll call it "rag on a stick."  In truth, the 23-T isn't terribly expensive.  But I will make sure I have clean hummer feeders.  I remain a big Perky-Pet fan, and will continue ordering their feeders, which I truly think are excellent.  But I'm afraid this particular product needs to go back to the drawing board.	-1
Is it just me? I can't get the mop into the small feeder neck. I have three different feeders and it won't work on any of them. The mop comes off the handle whenever I force the issue. I'm a pretty smart person - but this doesn't seem to be the cleaning tool I need for the feeders I have. Hmmmmm	-1
In the fall of 1775 the first ships of the Continental Navy assembled on the Delaware River.  Commodore Esek Hopkins issued instructions that the vessels in the fleet would fly a striped Jack and Ensign.  Since there is no example or representation of this flag, this has been taken to be what you see here: a flag consisting of thirteen red and white stripes, with a superimposed image of a rattlesnake and the motto "Don't Tread on Me."  The design has been inferred from both Hopkins' original instructions and a color plate of the "Don't Tread Upon Me" ensign in Admiral George Henry Prebel's "History of the Flag of the United States" (1880).  The three key components of the First Navy Jack are distinct origins.  The thirteen horizontal red and white stripes was known as the American Merchant Stripes (today this is popularly known as the Sons of Liberty flag, but that was originally nine vertical red and white stripes).  The stripes were used by American merchant ships during the Revolution and obviously is a precursor to the stripes on the Betsy Ross Flag.  The rattlesnake has become the key symbol of resistance to the British in the colonies and also was associated with American because of Ben Franklin's famous 1754 "Join or Die" political cartoon.  Specifically this was the Timber Rattlesnake, with the rattle having thirteen segments (matching the number of colonies).  The accepted idea was that the rattlesnake did not strike until it was provoked, which leads to the final element, the motto.  "Don't tread on me" comes from a standard that Colonel Christopher Gadsden presented to the Continental Congress to be used by the commander in chief of the American navy.  Known as the Gadsden flag, it was a yellow field with a rattle-snake in the middle in the attitude of going to strike, and the words "Don't Tread on Me!" appearing underneath.  In 1980, Secretary of the Navy Edward Hidalgo ordered that the ship in the U.S. Navy with the longest active status should display the First Navy Jack until the vessel was decommissioned or transferred to inactive duty.  On September 30, 1998, the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk (CV 63), commissioned in 1961, became the oldest active-status ship in the United States Navy and began flying the First Navy Jack.  However, on May 31, 2002, then Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England directed all U.S. Navy ships to fly this flag in honor of those killed on September 11th and for the duration of the War on Terrorism.  Consequently, the First Navy Jack has taken on a new symbolism in modern times.  This 3 by 5 foot single reverse flag is made of 100% heavyweight nylon fabric and I am pretty sure you do not need to fly it from a ship.	1
Looked all over for this flag. Good value	1
as advertised	1
Top shelf quality, I would highly recommend. You won't be disappointed. I am totally satisfied with the purchase. Thank You.	1
Well we have had this up for 3 days and my plants are loving it.  They have grown with this light on and if they had thumbs they would be up.	1
My grow light arrived faster than I expected(as usual with Amazon) ,which is nice. They packaged it so neither the fixture or the bulb would be damaged. I set it up, plugged it in,and turned it on,and it's a lot brighter than I thought it would be,for a fluorescent light. It also runs very cool,as it has been running for a couple hours and it's still just warm when I put my hand on it. The high pressure sodium and metal halide lamps are overkill for my application,and they get really hot,which forces you to figure out how to ventilate them really well. It's perfect for a few plants,so I'm very happy with this product.	1
Great light poor amazon packaging...  My bulb cam damaged too... The manufacturing box amazon decided to send me had a gouge on the side of the box... placed inside a large amazon box without any packaging paper, peanuts, or air bags.  so the box with in the box can thrash around in transit.  but amazon customer service came through and gave me a credit for the bulb 32 dollars but then the price of the bulb jumped up to 35 dollars.. lol  I say buy it but only through amazon as the seller so if your bulb is damaged in transit no hassles to complain...  But hydrofarm packaging of the bulb itself is to blame too, shame on them for not having the bulb more protected!!!	-1
I had to return this item 3 times before I finally gave up. So this is more of a review of the overall amazon experience on this item. Each and every time I received this, the ballast was broken. The problem is in the way this item is shipped. The bulb, which is very heavy is screwed into the ballast when shipping and has no other support. What that means is that there is a 3 inch space between the bulb and the shade so the normal jarring of shipping wear and tear breaks the ballast because of the lack of support. It was a very frustrating affair to say the least. Amazon handled the returns very well at no cost to me but it was still a hassle to pack and ship this 3 times. You may be better off finding a retail outlet for this item. I saw one at Alsip nursery here in Indiana but it was WAY more expensive that the amazon price. So buyer beware. If you order it, check the ballast real good!	-1
Not sure why but our birds don't like this one but they aren't eating it much. We bought the Woodpecker suet before and they ate it up quickly but not this one-Peanut.	-1
Most of the corn we buy in products is GMO corn unless specified differently. I want to help my birds and I can't in good conscience feed something that is detrimental to their health. I will not be buying this product until it says "GMO free."	-1
The birds barely touch this.  I have had the product in the feeder a week, and 2/3 of it is left.  When I put my home-made suet out, they gobble it up in a few days.  This attracts less bird activity than my home-made suet.	-1
I have found less expensive and higher quality products at stores nearby. The birds don't seem to like it and I will be looking elsewhere for my next carton of suet.	-1
I have two large and two smaller bales in my fishpond, and the only thing I see is the fact that those bales get very fast waterlogged (3 -4 days) and sink.  I have to fish them out and it takes several days for them to dry out.  It is a lot of money for a little bit of straw contained in netting and not doing anything!	-1
Not so good --- appears to have killed all the fish after 2 weeks in pond. Also caused water lilies to develop yellow leaves. Removed it. All went back to normal. Algae?  maybe less --- but killing fish and water lilies is not noted on package	-1
Sunk within days, even after letting it dry out and try again. Also, didn't do anything.	-1
woud nit buy again	-1
sinks to the bottom every day, need to take out to dry out, not sure how much good it does.	-1
Its only been 3 weeks, but its also only needing to treat a mere 10 gallon bowl pond. Not helping in the least bit yet - still having to use a net to get the guck and green algae off the bottom. Water hasn't cleared. Will repost if anything changes miraculously next week or beyond the 1 month mark.	-1
This stuff really doesn't work. I tried it because others have had success. My 400 gal fountain gets gunked up and the small barley bales make no difference.	-1
Didn't work at all, it was pretty bad that the barley straw was turning green with the algea it was suppose to prevent. Don't waste your money!! I put it in an established pond, did not submerge then added the other bundle 1 month b-4 the other one was done as per instructions and they both turned green with algea. Was it really barley straw? I couldn't be sure what I was buying I could only trust what the package said it could've been field grass for all I know, but one thing I do know it DID NOT WORK!	-1
Waste of money.	-1
Not happy with this product. I was expecting much larger boards. These are about the size of a postcard. Would not buy again and don't recommend.	-1
The product that these glue pads are used in does not meet my expectations..  It did NOT attract any of the flys that were in my house.  An old fashioned fly swatter did much better.	-1
it was a refill pack and I couldn't stick it anywhere did not work	-1
I have used this product for a few years, it works for both small fruit flies and normal house flies.  However the quality of  my latest order of the glue board refill is very low.  As soon I pull the wax paper off one new glue board, I noticed the glue side is very uneven, some areas show much thicker glue, and also the glue area is way off on one side, almost right on the edge of the board.  The lamp holding area has two holding edges on both side that require certain amount of glue free space on the glue board so you can slide the board in and out easily.  Without the clean space on one side, I had trouble to slide the board in since the glue sticks on the lamp holding edge before I can put the whole board in.  I tried the second one and it was the same problem.  Eventually I was able to push the board in the place, but I can tell the glue board is now stick on the lamp holding area so it would be a mess when I need to change another one.  This use to be a good product.  I never had to think too much every time when I changed a new board/sheet.  Please fix this problem.	-1
It fails to glue flys well enough.  Waste $$.	-1
idk	-1
I put this on a shelf in my truck,no flys went to it,so then I put a piece of candy on it. Still nouthing. I guess you have to get the yellow trap thing that goes with it.	-1
First off I should note that I used this product without the electric thing that you're supposed to put it in.  I didn't realize that these sticky sheets are refil pads for it and I don't have that so I just tacked the pad to the wall.  That being said it didn't catch any flies but a couple of poor geckos got stuck and died on it.  Same thing happens with the sticky roach motels (which are effective at catching roaches ahoyhoy).  So don't try using this product to catch flies by itself or if u have geckos.  I can't speak for the effectiveness of this product when used with its electrical counterpart.	-1
didn't work at all. waster of seed	-1
The design needs improvement since rainwater collects at the bottom two inches and ruins the seed.  Not sure what the answer is but this is the 3rd unit we have tried to attract goldfinches.  They do attract the birds, but must be cleaned too often.	-1
Just build it... its a 4 by 4 with a roof. Although I hope the money I payed went to something like a save, the bees program.	-1
The handle fell off and got lost in the first week of use, now it is useless. One don't expect that you'd have to check if it was assembled correctly.	-1
This POS valve replaced the oldie but goodie.  I hate this new style.  They have the same "03V" part number, but I have the old style that has a solid brass two sided twist lever, not the black handle type lever.  The old style also has a different style black hose connector that has 'paddles' that stick out and make it really fast and easy to twist on to the hose.  Why they ruined a perfectly great valve, I will never know.  These new style ones are REALLY hard to turn and hurt my hands.  I have two:  One I hate that hurts my hands to turn and the other one that the black lever is broke off and I have to use pliers to turn it.  The old style one I have is still working perfectly after years and years of use, turns smooth and easy and I love it.	-1
Bought one of these in 2010 to replace an older unit and the birdbath froze the first night.  Ended up buying another model that was rated at 250 watts.  This one is only 50 watts...that could be the problem.	-1
Well made, high quality item.  Works great!  Follow up!  picture shows brass on/off knob, it came with plastic.  On fourth use the screw holding the lever must have been getting loose and came off (did not break off) and disappeared somewhere in my yard :-(.  Valve is now useless but could be if I knew where to get another on/off lever with a screw (this time I would remove the screw and dab a little locktight on the threads.  Too bad it did appear to be well made even if the picture does not match what was sent.  so I have changed my rating to one star as a result	-1
Quit working before I got through one winter.  Not happy with it at all!	-1
I purchased one a year ago in the early spring and put it away, still in the package, until this winter.  It did not work when I set it up.  Since it had been several months, and I hadn't saved the receipt, I didn't try to return it. My mistake.  Based on favorable reviews, I took a chance and ordered another one this December.  It worked fine for about 6 weeks then quit.  I now have a concrete bird bath filled with a solid ice mass and the heater at the bottom.  This time I contacted the company.  The good news,  the product is warranted for 3 years. The bad news, they will not send a replacement unless I return the faulty product.  Looks like I'm stuck paying the shipping to return it too.  So I struggled to haul into the house the concrete bird bath filled with solid ice to allow it to thaw so I can go to the trouble of packaging it up, taking it to the post office and paying for shipping.  Don't make the same mistake.  Buy something else.	-1
I missed my return window as I kept giving this more and more chances. It does not keep the water open. It stays a slushy mess that the birds won't drink from. I live in Massachusetts; our weather is difficult at times. This does not meet my expectations. I wish I had returned it earlier.	-1
for the money it's pretty good and seems sturdy.  I'd change two things:  I would have the lever turn toward the hose as that direction has more clearance would be nice if the ball inside was a touch bigger to restrict a little less.  But for $7 it seems to be a keeper.  If I could have given it 4.5 stars I would have because of the price.  update: after a couple months the lever fell off and it was now obvious how flimsy  that lever is and how weakly it's attached to the body.  It's now of now use.	-1
I've had this heater about a month now and it has worked great for me.  We've had temperatures as low as -3 and it has kept the water completely free of ice.  I have it in a VERY small natural "lace stone" bird bath that I bought from our local nursery.  It actually barely fits in a nook in the bottom.  The cord is quite short, but I think bird bath locations will vary so much that it makes sense to use an extension cord that meets your needs.  The birds have been enjoying a source of water and I'm very happy with this purchase!  UPDATE 11/29/2017 : like other users this heater wouldn't work when I tried to use it for the a second season.  I'll be trying to find another one.	-1
This heater shorted out after the return period. I will not buy this model again'	-1
I live in NC, so only need this device on the rare occasion when we get ice storms and freezing temperatures. The first time I used it was during our January ice and snow event--worked beautifully, birds out there even while snowing. Second time to use was this week. Apparently it crapped out, so the water froze, cracking the birdbath.  So now I am out the $27 I paid for this AND the birdbath.  So it worked maybe a total of three days. But I got it before xmas so I suppose I can't return it.  There was a cheaper one online, maybe I'll try that.	-1
Hardly keeps water in a small bird  bath from freezing	-1
Sorry this stopped working after a couple weeks of usage.  If others had better luck I'm happy for them, but I need something that works.	-1
I purchased this unit (thru another website), and it worked great here in Massachusetts - for one season, then it failed. Not impressed with the longevity.	-1
Seeking the best available, I choose Gilmour. Having used their variety of connectors for over 2 seasons, I am and remain disappointed. The brass seems of poor quality and has a tendency to corrode. Leaks are too prevalent. This particular item is very difficult to open and close the valve, especially after not using it for a period of time. Plastic ones actually work better but don't hold up as well. I just wish these were of more professional quality.	-1
Froze solid in my birdbath.  Sent it back.	-1
I had a great time with this for ONE month. Was VERY happy that I solved a leaky problem with what I thought was ALL BRASS. After 1 month, I was watering and suddenly it started spraying everywhere. It broke and after turning off the water at the main faucet I came back to the connector only to find that there is plastic inside this thing. Very disappointed. Back on the search of a TRULY all-brass connector that won't break!!!	-1
I have several of these and they work well but on one, the little screw holding the shut off dial to the body fell out.  I wrote to Gilmour, asking them to please mail me a replacement screw as I couldn't find one to fit.  They replied, asking me to provide the original sales receipt AND informed me that there would be a $5.00 charge to send the screw to me.  $5.00 for a 2 cent screw.  I will never buy another Gilmour product as long as I live.  They know what they can do with their screw.	-1
This is in case anyone was wondering about longevity. I purchased this to go on my leaking outside faucet that is too involved to replace. It started leaking 8 months after I put it on. I also tried replacing the black rubber O ring that came with it with a new one and that did not stop the leak, either.	-1
Not that I hate it as the one star defines.  BUT it doesn't work.  I bought it in Nov ahead of winter for birdbath. I read all the reviews and looked a competitors.  I was disappointed in the extremely short 18 inch cord but decided it was the best for my needs. Had our first hard freeze here last night in GA and the water was frozen over.  Plugged into same outlet as water pump for small fountain and that motor was gasping along somehow, so I know it's not lack of electricity.  Going to return.	-1
This is another crap garden hose product. It broke with in weeks of use. First the screw came loose on the valve then the plastic nut cracked and made the hole thing useless. I also purchased and would recommend the (Dramm 12353 Heavy-Duty Brass Shut-Off Valve) (*The Dramm valve that I recommend is MADE IN THE USA!) you can find it here on Amazon. Yes it is expensive but it's made of machined brass and it very well built. It did make it though the summer and most likely will last a lifetime.	-1
Works as advertised.  But only for one season.  Although many reviewers have this same complaint, customer service claims that failures are "very rare".  I believed them and tried another,  ... and then another with same results.  Now looking for an alternative.	-1
Only melts enough where the unit is.	-1
Every year I have to buy new ones.  Wish I could find a more durable brand.  I'm looking but this is what's locally available	-1
I have somewhat lower water pressure, about 45 psi, and I think your average town water supply runs about 60, so that may have something to do with it.  But this thing was a joke, it sprayed about a 10' radius, ran for about 10 minutes, and then just stopped, spraying in just one spot.  I checked for clogs, etc. but no luck.  the one thing I can say is that it is quiet.  but I guess I'll go back to the old spring-type that makes that noise... I have several that are over 10 years old and they still work like the day I bought them.  Oh well, lesson learned.	-1
This sprinkler has three nozzles for near, medium, and far spray coverage. Unfortunately, the spray from each nozzle is too narrow, so there are gaps between the areas covered. As a result, you get rings of spray coverage (watered grass) separated by rings of no spray coverage (dry grass).  Also, this sprinkler is relatively big, and its bright coloring makes it stand out against the lawn.  Orbit sells a much smaller compact rotor / gear drive sprinkler, which provides better spray distribution, and is less expensive. Max distance is about the same, which is mostly dependant on your water pressure.	-1
This de-icer was working fine when the winter was mild.  However, once we started getting sub-freezing temperatures and lots of snow, it died!  I would not recommend it.	-1
With the weather in MA these last few weeks being below freezing a lot, this has been great for the birds.  Update February 10, 2014: shortly after writing this review the de-icer stopped working, it dead and, of course, its not returnable! It lasted less than two months! Another thing to consider the cord is too short and too heavy duty so when its cold it keeps popping out of the birdbath.	-1
Seemed to work fine the first few months, it's pretty much plug it in and forget it.  Then stopped working.  Like many other reviewers, reliability seems to be a problem.  Would not buy this model again.	-1
On the coldest winter days in NJ, it would keep an area of open water, not thaw the whole birdbath, which is fine. The birds find the spot OK. Near the end of last winter, I had to keep filling the bath more frequently than normal. I discovered that the thermostat was stuck on and the thing was hot and cooking the water, even on a mild day. It sports a 3 year warranty sticker, but is past the Amazon return period, having bought it in Dec 2010. Not sure I will go thru the mfgr's warranty hassle, paying freight both ways and probably getting a measly partial refund for a $30 product.	-1
I bought one of these back in Nov. 2004 and it just quit working which is pretty good. That said, I never liked it much. It only thaws a softball size area in the water in freezing weather. And the paint on the thing constantly flakes. Also the cover on the underside has a space between it and the element which traps all kinds of gook and is hard to clean out. If they made the bottom plate just snap on somehow instead of being screwed on you could remove it to clean it. Four stars for longevity, 2 for melting power and engineering.	-1
I find that convenience often outweighs the quality or even usability of the product. The thought that you could just place your plants out of sight out of mind while some miraculous grow kit does the work for you is an ideal based on nonsense. If it was that easy, there wouldn't be instructions.  I have found that warmth assists in germination over 40 years of gardening. But I don't buy a dedicated germination kit. The standard seeding kits available for $3.00 are fine. I have one I like for the windowsill, not because I love the brand or soil it contains, but because it FITS ON THE WINDOWSILL!! That makes it convenient for me and agreeable to the wife.  Heating pads are kind of silly. The cost is ridiculous and, if you really want to heat your seedlings, then put an electric blanket or throw under them. You can get a single blanket electric or throw for about $20 and you can sit like 6 of these starter trays on them and warm them all with a totally reusable unit.  I did notice that when on the electric blanket, the seedlings start a bit earlier. And if in a colder area (basement/attic) the blanket was essential to get them to kick into gear. But the blanket is huge and you can cover a much wider starting area. If you want a smaller area, fold the blanket. Low temp is usually enough to keep my kit around 70, but your environment may be different. Don't put either outside in 20 degree weather or you will get chilling results.  At any rate, these warming seed starting kits are a waste of money. If you have absolutely no sun exposure or are starting so many you can't keep them in the house on a window sill or near any window, then get a heating blanket and a grow light. Much cheaper in the long run.	-1
Unbelievably expensive for what you get. It does the job but you could make your own heated seed tray for a fraction of the cost. I simply didn't have time to do that so I bit the bullet.	-1
VERY CHEEP JUNK LID HAS CRACKED ALL READY	-1
Plastic warped after a few weeks. Get the items individually instead of in this little bundle.	-1
pure junk why to much $$$$	-1
The package was damaged beyond use.  I don't have the time or patience to wait around for another one to actually be packaged correctly. Shouldn't be that hard not like you flipping burgers. Returning your broken product is to much of a hassle. You are required to buy a printer if you need to print off the label to return the crap you guys sent packaged like it was a box of rocks and not a piece of plastic that breaks super easy.	-1
Just put this together.  Yech.  Really, really flimsy construction -- paper-thin plastic dome with paper thing plastic vents that don't stay in their mounting slots.  The holders for the seedlings are also quite thin as is the base into which they sit.  No surprise that it arrived damaged, but still usable.  Finally the directions are inadequate and incomplete.  Hopefully will get me through this spring then I will find something else.  I do not recommmend purchasing this item.	-1
DO NOT BUY. This is junk I bought this filled the seed pods with miracle grow seed starter put in some pansy seeds and after 6 weeks I got two straggly seeds come up I kept the Miracle grow damp not too wet. I put the unit on a wooden shelf that gets plenty of sun and is well protected and nothing I thought at one time the heat mat was not working and had a second heat mat sent to replace the original no difference. I have been a home gardener for 40+ years and planted seeds directly in the ground and always got good results I just wanted to get a jump start on growing season what a waste of money	-1
I was shocked that the dome was not made of sturdy plastic.  Instead, it is about the weight you would find over a plate of supermarket cookies.  Mine arrived all misshapen and bent.  The trays, too, are pretty cheaply made.	-1
Cheap flimsy plastic. Not worth $1	-1
Heat mat is weak. Tray is just ok....	-1
didnt come with plugs now i have to order extra.thought that it was a kits lol next time i'll read detail better woudv've brought it without the plugs	-1
This wouldn't last one growing period! It's thin, cheap, brittle plastic. The tray was cracked, broken & warped, the cover was warped as well. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone! Buy a separate heating pad & purchase some heavy duty trays & covers on your own. It'll be cheaper in the long run  & WILL last longer then this piece of garbage!	-1
it is a waist of money it dry out to fast and the water is leaking out of the side the top should be inside of the bottom not the way it is right now	-1
I asked the seller to give me a replacement heating mat because the one I got I couldn't feel any heat from even after hours of it being on inside the house on the carpet. So what does the seller do. Well the seller completely ignored my message of what was wrong specifically because instead of just replacing the heat mat. They sent a completely replacement of everything which is not only not what I asked for since I only wanted a replaced heat mat and nothing else. But now I have to pay the return shipping and go through the work and effort of shipping period just to return the old package. It would have been easier if the seller had listened to my complaint and then just would have known that all I needed was a new heat mat with nothing to be returned. Since there is no need to return even the old heat mat because it's broken. Well the new heat mat that I received was not much better than the first. I do notice slightly a little heat. But barely any. And I'm starting to see a pattern with this company as this is not the first product that has had to be replaced. I also had to replace a scope magnifier that had a broken led. And the batteries that it needs to work do come with the package but you better never need to replace them because they use some foriegn non american batteries that they need to work. Because American size AAs won't work because they won't fit very well at all.	-1
I bought this hoping to speed up a late start on a few veggies. I planted a dozen different seeds using potting soil in the cell tray.  After 24hrs I took off the dome and was just about over whelmed by a strong chemical smell. I left the cover off for a couple of hours and the smell lessened somewhat. I put the dome back on and left it over night. The next day the strong smell was back. So I left the dome off and covered the tray with plastic wrap. Again next day same smell just as strong. I determine that the smell was from the bottom tray. I move the cell tray to an old garden tray and rigged the dome on to it. Two weeks later nothing has germinated and the soil still smells faintly of the chemical. Whatever the chemical vapor was it killed my seeds.	-1
Excerpt from Amazon description: "The system includes 72 seed starting plugs. These OMRI-certified pre-sized drop-in plugs provide for quick, easy starts without the fuss and mess of dealing with dirt. A tall domed cover makes it perfect for starting cuttings."  *** there are NO GROW PLUGS INCLUDED!! *** This was a Xmas gift & the one that bought it THOUGHT it was a COMPLETE kit, well it AIN'T! So now I have "the fuss and mess of dealing with dirt" - LOL The dome fits OUTSIDE the 'waterproof' tray and will drip condensate on your work surface, mine is a wood table, so another 'waterproof' tray is needed to put this grow tray in, whats up with that? Poor design? The dome is also very thin & came with crease/dents due to shipping damage (maybe poor packaging). The same item from the big-box store does include grow plugs and sells for about the same price, or less. The heat mat works great, I have a thermostat with mine & am happy with both them & the waterproof tray......... I'm only using this for seed starting so I bought plastic six packs & root riot grow plugs, the plugs will NOT work in the 72 hole insert - so it went in the Gar-bage, just cover the 6-paks with cling wrap if you want or need humidity, done, IMHO.	-1
not user friendly	-1
This timer is the worst battery operated timer I've ever purchased...does not close with brand new batteries installed and in ca that's the worst thing you can have is a water timer not stop when it is supposed to. Very very disappointed that amazon would sell a product that had poor reviews to start with and disappointed in myself for not paying attention to the reviews myself	-1
I originally gave these timers a 5 star review, but after having 4 of them for awhile, I am finding I just can't trust them.  The biggest problem is when they go from working just find to constant "on"... In southern california, this is considered sinful, not t mention expensive!  Is has happened to 2 of my 4 stations.  The other problem is when they go from working fine to just not working at all even tho the batteries are good.  I love the idea of these, but my cheaper more cumbersome older models have been much more reliable.  Original post:  This is a great little unit, and I have tried a number of them over the years.  This one seems well made, is easy to use, and has the added feature of being able to remove the programmable box, so that you can actually read what you are doing without bending over in the hot sun and craning your neck in a contortion to try and read the panel.	-1
Worked for less than 2 years and then stuck in open position, wasting water. Glad I wasn't on away.	-1
I had used an identical timer a few years ago.  It kept good time and was reliable.  So I paid more to buy the same model again.  During the installation, it came apart in my hands and try as I may, I could never get the pieces back together.  Very disappointing after liking the previous one.  The quality difference was night and day!  If my bare hands caused it to fall apart this way, I dread what continuous water pressure might have done over time.	-1
This timer was not that easy to setup with all the button pushing. I would often turn it off by accident and the watering would not happen.  The timer worked for one season and then the display stopped working.  I replaced it with the Orbit 62061N-91213 Single-Dial Water Timer. I like the dial, it makes it easy to understand what is going on. AND it is half the price. Lets see how long it lasts.	-1
I bought this at the beginning of July and it will not shut off Mid Oct. It's life was what, 31/2 months, I do not think it is worth the MONEY. NEWS FLASH!!!!! Additional information------ As I stated above the obit 62001 quit working. Because it worked so well to begin with I decided to take it apart. When I got it all a part I found a couple of drops of water in the piston barrel that is activated by the magnet that surrounds it to close a diaphragm, shutting off the water flow. Took a paper towel, dried out the barrel and piston and BLAM it is working again. I do not know if that was the cause of it not working but I am willing to take it apart each time it stops shutting off the water because when it works it's great.	-1
I have two of these timers.  One only lasted one season.  The timer still works but the unit does not properly turn on and off even though the program is correct - it is sometimes on when should be off and sometimes off when should be on.  I did a unit reset and that didn't help, neither did putting in a new battery.  The solenoid is not high enough quality.  The remaining unit is still working fine, its a perfectly good timer when it works.	-1
I have used these for the past couple of years. I need 9 to control my drip system. I've just come to accept that these don't last thru more than one summer, and often not that long. They are poorly made and poorly supported. I just consider this a yearly ritual, replacing 75%(ish) of my last years hardware. If you leave them out thru the winter, they will not survive, based on my inadvertant oversite of leaving 2 out thru the winter.  These are not quality items. If you can accept that they only last one season (at best), it it may be an option for you. If not, choose something else.	-1
I bought two of these.  One failed after a few months by staying on at the end of the cycle, flooding my yard.  Seemed to work on manual some of the time.  New batteries made no difference.  I dismantled it and there was no damage or debris.  The solenoid mechanism is extremely delicate, depending on a fine spring and the magnetic properties of a small plunger.  I finally got it working but it failed again after a few months.  Bad design.  I would prefer that it fail by not going on.  If the lawn starts looking dry, I can address that.  If it floods for 12 hours before I see it, it will do damage, cost a lot of money (water is expensive where I live), and will break the law (watering is only allowed on certain days and times).  UPDATE: The second one just failed.  I found my back yard flooded this morning.	-1
Looked forward to this unit...now must return because it leaks terribly at the point of attachment..tightened over and over...tried new washers..still leaks....	-1
I waited a few months to post a review to give this a good workout and see how it holds up. Well I can say that I like this alot, and after a few months of constant use it still works just fine. Its easy to program and use just don't lose the instructions.  UPDATE: Lasted one year and then it stopped, don't buy it	-1
So far I've purchased two of the Orbit 62001 Lawn Timers, but I've gone through about four of them with Amazon and the local mega-mart. The first 62001 I purchased in 2008 died (and it was my fault) when I left it out for a day during a freeze (note: I live in southern Texas, and by "freeze" I meant - it hit 30 for about two hours at night). The digital portion worked fine but the actual physical housing which rotated the open-and-close water flow restrictor would simply no longer operate. I replaced this unit with another from Amazon and it worked fine for the following summer. Having learned my lesson, I unhooked the timer for the next winter and left it in a dry, insulated, garage. The garage would hit a low of around 40 versus the outdoor temperature of 30 or less. The garage never hit freezing temperatures and the batteries were out of the unit until the following spring. When spring came, the same problem occurred - the digital portion worked fine, the physical water restrictor would no longer move. I ordered replacement #3 from Amazon and this time straight out of the clamshell the unit would not work - same exact issue. I returned the unit to Amazon and grabbed a replacement from the local mega mart - again, same exact issue.  Now, I should state that I live in an area with hard water and yes I can see that being a possible issue.  Perhaps gunking up the the inner-workings of these timers and restricting the mechanics from moving about properly. However with my two "mostly-broken" units I've torn them apart and found no calcium build up on the regulator or even evidence of rust or circuit corrosion (I am not an engineer but when comparing a working to non-working unit, it all looked the same). I should also note that I have a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Orbit-62032-Yard-Watering-System/dp/B000BH7KQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Orbit 62032 Yard Watering System</a>&nbsp;in my backyard and it has been working fine for three years running. After multiple tries with the 62001, I've stepped down to the slightly less functionally robust&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Orbit-62061N-Single-Dial-Water-Timer/dp/B004INGS8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Orbit 62061N Single-Dial Water Timer</a>&nbsp;in hopes that it might last longer than a year.  I've given these units two stars (instead of one) because there is the slightest chance that I simply might have been unlucky with my four units. When these worked, they worked flawlessly day-after-day. Multiple timers and day-to-day nuances made watering during drought restrictions a breeze. I just wish they would last.	-1
I programmed it as instructed. Then, I used the "manual" which allowed it to water. When I tried to go back to auto mode the unit could not turn off. I even reset and reprogrammed the thing. No matter what I tried from that point on it was on all the time. I sent it back.	-1
This would be a great timer. It is easy to set. Keeps the settings when you change batteries. Resists water. Allows manual override and lets you remove the timer from the valve to program. The big problem that it shares with most of these timers is lack of reliability. Mine stopped working within a week. The company was very easy to deal with and offered to ship a new one next day but I need a timer now or my plants will die so I will return it to Amazon.	-1
This is the Velcro model which is a pain to deal with - spend the extra money and get the K13 model which has a zipper	-1
I have tried numerous bags of all types and this one is THE worst yet. The actual sand silt portion of bag is very small and does not pick up the sand well at all. Tossed it out. Beware...	-1
Piece of crap!!! My last bag lasted two seasons and this lasted a day. Made like garbage and had a slit in it where attaches to Velcro. Very upset and now without a working bag. Please send me another or refund.	-1
I didn't receive the sink in the picture. The connector is lower down and it leaks like hell. Would really like to buy the one as advertised.	-1
Velcro doesn't wash out very easy. Zipper bag us much better.	-1
The photo shows a genuine Kohler oil filter, but I received a generic filter. The filter was wrapped in plastic and under the plastic was about a teaspoon of some sort of green goo. I opened the plastic and wiped off the goo and there was rust on the filter where the goo had been. Very disappointed in what I received and the condition it arrived in.	-1
I bought this lounger from Sharper Image for $149 a couple of yrs ago and I hate it. It is uncomfortable, the material is stretched hard across, the cushions are hard, and you can't read thru the hole coz it's too close you your face.	-1
Way too small.	-1
This bird bath is *so* shallow ..way  more than even the picture makes it seem.  The metal is flimsy - and the plastic is cheap.  The tabs didn't hook in enough to even catch - so I guess thank goodness the metal is flimsy, as I was able to end it in by hand enough so that the tab catches, but I doubt it will stay that way.  The only reason I haven't returned it yet is that I'm going to try using it as a squirrel feeder.  But, yeah, a $50 squirrel feeder. :~(  If I had had an opportunity to spend a few minutes with this birdbath in person (say, in a store), I would *never* have ordered it. Save your money, and get a nice freestanding birdfeeder.	-1
The plastic portion of the bird bath bowl is solid and sturdy.  However, the mounting bracket is poorly constructed and does not hold the bowl securely.  To hold the bold securely, you must tighten the bolt on the mounting bracket to the point it damages the wood of your deck.  I returned this item for a refund.	-1
I sent this back.  Totally out of balance for a railing and if a turkey sat on the edge would fall apart.	-1
Worked fine for about 6 weeks, then the display started showing nonsense.  Replaced the batteries, no change.	-1
The weather meter shows temperature and moisture level in a room.  It has a large digital display that I can see across the room.  I don't know about the temperature; but the moisture level number "seems" to kind-of match what is shown in my humidifier.  The bottom line is that it is cheap and good, and I bought two of them -- one in each floor.  UPDATE ON 08/22/2012: Sadly after one year, both units died.  Therefore, I will have to give it a low rating.	-1
The accuracy and features of this were just what we wanted, but we were no prepared for how poor the LCD display was.  You must mount this in a very well lit area to see it.  Note to Amazon: The photo above is misleading.  The LCD is NOWHERE NEAR as bright and high contrast as the product photo above.  I think I'll post a customer photo that shows it a little more accurately.  I'm wishing I'd have spent a little more for a nicer unit, but not dissatisfied enough to go through the return hassles.	-1
I gave this as a Christmas gift, the sensor (placed in a protected area) quit working within 3 months of the gift.  Unrealiable product.  Of course as it worked when it purchased I didn't keep the receipt, add to that the fact that Amazon will not accept returns on anything older than 30 days even if it is a gift.	-1
This product worked for only about six months before either the outside sensor or the internal receiver stopped working and I could no longer see the outside temperature.  Battery replacement was futile.	-1
Temp registers 4-7 degres off actual temp.  Usually too high.  Clock consistently 5 minutes ahead of actual time<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/La-Crosse-Technology-WS-9013U-Wireless-Temperature-Station/dp/B00077AA4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">La Crosse Technology WS-9013U Wireless Temperature Station</a>	-1
Purchased as replacement for Polaris booster pump which lasted 8 years.  This version lasted 1 year and 1 month,  Has 1 year warranty.  My next purchase will be different brand.	-1
Junk. ... stopped working within 6 months.  I've been working on pools and with pool equipment since the 1970's and can assert that this piece of junk was installed correctly. The motor starts so there's no issue with the starting capacitor. The problem is it's not pumping water.  Now I have to deal with the problem of disconnecting and repairing	-1
DIRECT replacement works perfect. 08/14/2016 Pump seal failed. Warranty is parts only. A $.50 seal is all they provide only after having you jump through several hoops proving what contractor or pool installer installed the pump. This companies warranty is crap. I will certainly look at other options. Certainly will not buy anything further from Zodiac or Polaris, no warranty.	-1
Did not order	-1
Burned out after only 3 months - it remains to be seen if Zodiac will provide good warranty customer service (thus far, they haven't been very helpful at obtaining repair service). I'll update review at the conclusion of this misadventure, but I'm beginning to worry that it won't end well.	-1
I've been working on and installing pools for over 20 years, and have installed hundreds of Polaris pool cleaners.  In the last two years, I have purchased, for my customers, this Zodiac motor, to replace the original Polaris motor.  Apparently Zodiac has purchased the Polaris name.  This motor makes 75% more noise than the original Polaris motor!!!!  I have one, that is one year old, in a electric motor repair shop, for a replacement bearing, to try and make this thing run quiet, like it should.  Either they are putting a cheap bearing in this motor, or it's coming from overseas, and the bearings are rusting in route.  The one I just installed is far enough away from the pool, it is tolerable, and seemed to quieten down, after running for about an hour.  The first one I ordered is in the shop, to see what they can do, so people around the pool will be able to have a conversation, while this thing is running.  This shouldn't be making this much noise.  I'll probably never buy a new motor again.  If possible, I will repair the old Polaris motor	-1
I had a professional pool service install this pump and he said the shaft does not turn freely.  It seems to be in a bind.  I am returning the pump for a refund.  Very disappointed as this was going to save me about $150.	-1
Bought this when my 6 year old model began to run loudly. Had it installed by pool/spa man. Then by end of January 2013, began making noises again. Not happy with this motor. July 14, 2013 pump made two loud noises and stopped working....I am going to contact the seller and ask NOW WHAT.  very UNHAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.	-1
Poorly made. Barely lasts a year and a half (~6 months past warranty). Will not buy again. This is in regards to the POLARIS PB4-60, 3/4HP 115/230V BOOSTER PUMP.	-1
We had a hot weather spell in California last week, five consecutive days over 100 degrees and barely cooled down at night.  This pump did not make it, started making horrible noises.  Thought it might be the seal so I took a look.  But no, it is the motor that is toast, makes grinding noise if I turn the shaft.	-1
skimming through some of the recent posts it looks like I'm not alone. This pump lacks any kind of durability. I purchased this July 23, 2012 and it is already dead. This is definitely not typical of the pumps I have used for the main or auxiliary on the pool. Quite a disappointment. Certainly looking for other options at this point. Considering the thing runs a small fraction of the time in comparison to the other pumps, this seems a quality manufacturing problem.	-1
Pump from lowes was stronger. If height is required for water, i'd pass. By eye ball, it gets 6" or so on small attachment (less volume). Not very strong.	-1
Returning this, but not for the reason you might think.  It seems to work ok, from what I can tell.  But it's so big it won't fit into the area in any of my four fountains, for a pump.  And two of them are very large fountains. AND it's very, very noisy.	-1
WARNING!!! This pump we bought stopped working after a few days. This was such a necessity for us. We've had 3 fountains working round the clock and you get use to the tranquil noise instead of the freeway noise. We returned it and bought this again and the second burned out. A third and burned out.	-1
Having used industrial Little Giant pumps I had high hopes for this.  Sadly I was very disappointed.  When first plugged in it would not run.  I even adjusted the front in case it was too far towards the - side.  Still nothing.  I was taking it out of the water and it turned on.  So I reassembled the fountain plugged it back in and nothing.  I took the fountain apart once again (3-tier and very heavy concrete) and as I went to take it out of the water it began working again.  Because I wanted to give it a fair chance I reassembled the fountain and it worked.  I unplugged it while I reset the external timer.  When I plugged it back in - nothing.  I don't want to risk breaking a 40-year old fountain fiddling with this pump.  It is on its way back.  I stopped by a local garden center today and bought some brand that they recommended and it started up first shot and all is well.  Very disappointed.	-1
Here's the problem: most fountains require a water-tight plug around the electric cord so that the water can't escape out the hole in the fountain through which the cord passes.  While you may be able to salvage the old water type plug from you existing fountain, you will have to cut through the old extension cord to slide it off.  This leaves you with the dilemma of how to get the old stopper onto the cord of your Little Giant Submersible Statuary Fountain Pump.  1. Option 1 is to disassemble the pump, remove the electric cord, slide the salvaged rubber stopper over the end of the cord, reattach the cord to the pump, and seal up the pump.  Unfortunately, you have broken the pump's watertight seal in the process.  2. Option 2 is to cut the plug off the electric cord and slide the salvaged rubber stopper on from that end.  Now you just have to rewire and tape the severed plug to the end of the cord.  This is not a good idea if the cord is left out in the weather or buried in the ground, as eventually water is going to seep into the repaired cord.  3. Option 3 is to slice open the salvaged rubber stopper, slide it around the electric cord, and repair the cut stopper with silicon.  The only alternative to the above surgical operations is to forget about the internal plumbing of the fountain and drape the electric cord over the edge of the fountain's water basin and let it dangle.  That's very unsightly and presents a tripping hazard, as well as an obstacle to running a lawn mower or other lawn care tools around the fountain.  Any replacement pump for statuary fountains really should come with a factory-installed stopper already on the electric cord.  Unless you have the tools and patience to perform one the above operations, DO NOT BUY THIS PUMP!!!	-1
Plugged it in in December and it stopped working in the 2nd week of January.  It kept kept blowing a fuse.	-1
It worked for about two weeks. Now it just trips the GFCI breaker. I considered cutting off the ground pin, but that might end up electrocuting my birds.	-1
The unit wants to float on top of the water... scares the critters with its shiny surface.  I see others weigh it down with something.  Our bird water dish is 12 inch round and only 3 inches deep.  It worked okay until the temperature was in the single digits.  Now the top of the dish is frozen solid.	-1
This worked well as far as preventing the water in the bird bath from freezing, but it formed a green slime on the surface and had to be repeatedly cleaned.  Would not buy another one.	-1
sent back  and replaced and it did not work either	-1
worked for just one year, but sometimes did not come on at all and water froze.  Like the low wattage usage, but not reliable.  Sometimes fails as it kicks off the GFI and since the reset is in the basement, do not notice for a day or more, so water freezes.	-1
Only worked for three weeks then stopped, wasn't even that cold out yet. There was a section of the cord close to the foil that got warm to the touch, probably wasn't supposed to be doing that. The foil covering didn't seem like it would have lasted all winter anyway. Might be better for a smaller bath - I have a large concrete one.	-1
Do not buy this.	-1
Well, the old saying "you get what you pay for" since this is a real flimsy construct and my expectations are low for it to last one season.  This is a junk product.  It never worked in my bird bath.  Do not buy this product because it is poorly made and very filmsy construction.  Poor product and it failed to work for me.  Threw it away in the trash where it belongs.  Bad bad bad.	-1
I have revised my review. This worked for one season and I now go to use it for winter 2016 - no good. It just sat in my shed over the summer in a small box. You get what you pay for. Spend a little more and get a better heater.	-1
Doesn't keep ice out of bird bath	-1
Sent back right away.  It did not work.  Waste of money and effort.  My poor birdies still don't have water in cold winters!!!!  Any suggestions out there please email me.  vskelley51@yahoo.com.	-1
Wouldn't sit flat without adding a rock to it. Cord is too short to reach up and over the lip of the fountain. Failed after 3 days. SHOULD HAVE KNOWN AT SUCH A LOW PRICE.	-1
Disappointed with product as our birdbath was frozen over all winter - will look for a better qualit heater next winter	-1
It didn't keep my bird bath from freezing.  It would only work if it was 30 degrees.  Anything below that temp and the water was frozen.  Don't waste your $ or electricity.	-1
It does warm the bird water, but also dries it up so water has to be added regularly.  Do go away and leave this alone for more than 24 hours.	-1
Its difficult to use in my garden and rather ugly to look at. But it does heat up as promised	-1
I bought two of these in June 2012, since a more expensive one died after one season. First, these don't have a thermostat, so during a spell of warmer weather, the water will steam away and evaporate in no time unless you unplug it, a PIA. The thing floated in my 4 inch deep bird bath, so I gently placed a brick over it to not only keep it down but provide another perch for the birds and animals. It is best to cover over the cord with something too, as it resembles a snake and scares some birds away. Anyway, it worked fine during Dec and Jan, when last week I noticed that the water was gone after filling it one day earlier and the warmer was hot. Corrosion had created a hole in the foil and possibly shorted it out. We have pretty good quality neutral city water in NJ. So I replaced this one with the spare and will try to return it to the mfgr since the Amazon return limit date is passed. Also, plugging it into a ground fault breaker will keep tripping it in many instances. If anyone knows of a better quality warmer with a thermostat, pls comment.	-1
I ordered three of these "Farm Innovators B-9 Economical Birdbath De-Icer, 44-Watt", 2 for our yard and one for a friend. Luckily, the one bought for our friend is working. The two for our birdbaths do not.  One immediately trips any outlet that it is plugged into. The other does not trip the GFI but it does not keep the water from freezing. Also, the ones I bought were Amazon Prime but when I tried to return them on the order center, it said it was over 30 days from the purchase and I could not return them. WHAT? I ordered them Oct 30, it is now Nov 12, and this is the first time we have had hard freezing at night, so the first time they were tried. Plus, the link to the PDF "Product Manual" is for different models, not this one.  I am dissapointed and also MAD!	-1
<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Farm-Innovators-Economical-Bird-Bath-De-Icer-Model-B-9-44-Watt/dp/B000793M68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Farm Innovators Economical Bird Bath De-Icer Model B-9, 44-Watt</a>  I really wanted to like this heater. It's made in my hometown. First of all, it floated and I had to weight it down with a rock. I called their help line and was told that was okay. As long as the temp was above 25 degrees it worked fine. But any lower, it froze on the top inch. It froze all the way when it got below that. I wasn't able to remove the Farm Inno heater until the water thawed. When I did, it tore. Also, I cracked my birdbath trying to thaw it. I didn't know that until I had purchased another heater. Of course, all the water leaked out. I am thankful that I realized that & I caught it in time to prevent the new heater from burning out.	-1
Obviously, there's a quality control issue with Farm Innovators' econo de-icer.  Mine worked great for a month or so. It no longer functions. Those lucky enough to get a defective one right out of the box can return it and try again, others are either satified or 'left cold'. I regret not paying a few dollars more and perhaps receiving something more durable.	-1
I'd used a similar bird bath heater before and it was getting corroded looking after a few years' use so I decided to replace it.  This one just didn't work after a couple of days.	-1
Terrible design.  You'd think Fiskars could find a better way to attach the Spring.  15 minutes of pruning, spring gone.  It's black, not shiny, searched 20 min and gave up because I had a second unit standing by.  That one too, maybe 15-20 minutes into pruning my fruit trees -- adios spring.  It'll probably get stuck in my lawnmower but until then, I have two of these headed to the junk heap.	-1
I've had these for almost a year and, while I like the overall design, the quality just isn't there. I have 3 sets of pruners around the house and these have only seen light duty around the garden. The steel in the blade doesn't hold up well. I sharpened it, but the whole blade has turned black and tarnished. This is probably the difference between regular steel and stainless.  Worse, the plastic locking slider has stripped so now the pruners stay open all the time. The plastic seems like about the cheapest available, seems a little higher quality wouldn't be out of the question.  That said, the ergonomic handles and general feel is solid. Just wish they weren't so cheaply made. Two stars for not lasting more than a year.	-1
I've had my trusty Weber charcoal grill as long as I've had my house(16 years) and it's starting to look a little rough.  Yes, I should have purchased a cover years ago, but never thought that I absolutely NEEDED a grill cover.  Now the grill looks so bad I didn't think twice upon seeing one on clearance at my local red-store for less than 3 bucks!  Yeah, the reviews aren't great, but if you just need something CHEAP for a short time this will do the trick.  It fits the grill fine, but I feel it's a few inches too short.  Also, the material is so light I've had to retrieve it from my neighbor's yard anytime there's a windy day(maybe a longer length would help there too?).  It looks good from a few feet away, but you can tell it's pretty flimsy anything closer.  I'm not sure about the durability yet, but I'm not sure it will be an issue as it will probably blow away before it gets any damage.  It will keep bird poo off your grill and it makes a great frost-cover for your outdoor pepper/tomato plant(I speak from experience) so that's an added bonus!  In fact, if I can find more at the same price I will get them for all my outdoor plants.  Two stars for just barely doing the job, but having other uses if you're creative.  Jae	-1
AWFUL.....tore 'spontaneously' after only a few months being on the grill....not even being used or taken on/off.  It 'may' have had a little early morning sun, but that's it....I can't even think of a reason this would tear and disintegrate like I just discovered it had!  VERY DISAPPOINTING.	-1
Looked great when received. After less than a week it looked like I had taken a razorblade to it. It started falling apart from not being used. Not the Weber quality I had anticipated.	-1
This is a different material than the last one that got cracked in the elements. Still ok but seems lower quality.  Update: lasted 6 months. The sun destroys this material. Total garbage.  Update2: I bought another one because I'm stupid. The bright side is that you can buy 5 if these and still won't pay as much as you would for the "premium" one.  Anyone have any suggestions for a third party cover?	-1
when the weather got cold item ripped apart.	-1
Junk, don't waste your money	-1
this cover did not fit on his weber smoker,,, i will have to send back	-1
I bought this flag in September 2015 and the threads at the bottom started coming out shortly after hanging. I was able to trim them off, but  now, June 2016,  the flag has a 2" deterioration tear at the side diagonal from the stars.  This has been flown every day in Florida, but the winter sun/weather shouldn't have been a factor.  Most other flags have a different style pole and attachment -- metal clasps -- so I will probably have to get a whole new flag and pole.  Which brings another problem of the flag holder which is a bear to attach to my garage stucco.  This flag has had such great reviews ... maybe I just got one from a bad batch.	-1
it's not true about it never tangling up around the pole!  I have to untangle this flag every other day!  am about ready to retire it after only having it displayed for a week!	-1
This flag looks good on my Grace Alley flag pole which is supported by the black forged flag pole holder from China. I am happy with the purchase. The life of the flag is unknown and has to share the flag pole holder with a Ukrainian flag (I have three adopted children from Ukraine) and the Israel flag. Update: I finally noticed it is a one-sided flag and I hate it! I am sorry for the sloppy original review. However, if one sided is good for you then this is probably a good buy.	-1
So very disappointed when putting up this flag today! The bracket was not included as stated plus there was a ring with a clasp at the bottom of the inserted flag with no directions as not sure why the clasp was there. This was also not the quality of our previous flag so don't know if I must have ordered a cheaper one. I also don't like the other parts being made in China when the flag was advertised as being made it the USA.	-1
I was impressed by the description and some of the reviews for this flag. ( I should have paid more attention to the negative ones). Unlike its claim, it does twist and wrap around the pole. After only two weeks of use, the end is frayed and looks like it is a couple years old. I wanted to buy  an American manufactured flag that would not twist around itself. I fly a flag almost constantly, except in severe weather I am returning this flag with hopes that I can find one that actually does as described.  Although others have had success, I can not  recommend.	-1
This flag fell apart in mere months, frayed, and it had to be replaced far too soon.  I have purchased over 6 flags from 2 or 3 different companies over the years.....this one performed the poorest unfortunately. I live in SW Florida and the sun, wind, rain does not bode well on fabrics I guess.	-1
Unfortunately this flag tattered and came apart within a few weeks.  I am trying to figure out how to request a replacement as I'm normally very happy with the quality of the Valley Forge flags.  Seems my only option according to Amazon is to write a review and hope someone reaches out?	-1
These are minimally okay as long as you don't use a full size flag in windy conditions. My flag is a lightweight nylon variety, 3'x5' and this bracket has broken twice on me. The first lasted a couple years, the second lasted only a few months before high winds snapped in half.  I'm in the search for a more heavy duty bracket.	-1
Broke November 29th in Wind's here at home.	-1
Purchased a second one of these after the first broke in wind. Just lost the second one to wind. Had a plastic one before these two which lasted 8 years without breaking. Figured metal would be stronger...nope.	-1
Seven Brothers did fulfill the order for an embroidered flag.  But the picture shown is that of a Valley Forge brand flag.  That is not what was received.  It was a flag stuffed in a 4"x6" brown envelope with no packaging.  It is obviously a knock off.  It is not so much the product I am unhappy with (don't know how long it will last yet...), but the deception involved.  Seven Bro.s should just show the product for what it is.  Do not buy from Seven Brothers if you expect to get the name brand product that they show in the picture!  Following is communication I had with Seven Brothers.  Decide for yourself if you want to do business with them: ______________________________________________ Amazon Communication Center wrote: Hello from Amazon.com. - A potential buyer has sent you the following message about an item you have for sale on Amazon.com:  You are deceptive in showing an image of a Valley Forge Flag.

Stupidest thing I've ever heard. I must also say I am disappointed that almost a year later Amazon has not required this seller to be truthful.	-1
I guess that I should have known that a nylon flag wouldn't last too long but this one is badly frayed in just over four months.  If you're going to fly a flag 24/7 in a windy area buy a polyester flag.	-1
Holds in light wind areas. Broke two tithin a month	-1
I have used two or three of these and they DO NOT hold up under windy conditions.  They break off at the base.  I thought it was just a fluke until the third one broke off at the base too.  If you have windy conditions, I would not buy this unit.	-1
Valley Forge should be ashamed of themselves....once upon a time that name in Manufacturing meant nothing but the finest in flags. In MY OPINION, this flag may look great being draped over a chair at a Veterans meeting or something along that line OR maybe on a pole inside a building in the backdrop, on a stage, along a walkway; BUT NOT where there is any wind to speak of.....maybe a gentle breeze! It is nice looking but that is all I can say for it!	-1
This bracket looked strong and we were very pleased with it, right up until it snapped in two just as the other reviewer mentioned. Very disappointed.	-1
I love the design of this bracket.  It's adjustable and easy to use.  But as you've seen from the other reviews - there is a major flaw in metal of the base.  It simply snaps in two under wind-pressure - the last thing one expected when buying a more expensive metal bracket.  So, it is effectively useless.  Real bummer for such a well-designed product to fall apart because of shoddy metal-work.	-1
I have flown this type flag for years, this one was up only about 3 months when the end seam tore off and the flag started fraying. The US flag that I fly with this still looks new.  Update on new flag purchased March of 2013. I decided to add extra stitching along the outer end of the flag. I stitched between the factory stitching which added 3 or 4 more lines of sewing. The flag has been up5 weeks and the end has already come off and it is starting to fray! I will not purchase this type of flag from Valley Forge flags again.	-1
This cast aluminum bracket broke in half at the base, at the point where it adjusts to different angles. It is not well engineered. This failure is apparently the same as several others have had before me.  I called Valley Forge Flag to see if they would replace the bracket and they would not. But the funniest part was that two different reps (including one supervisor) told me tha the flag & pole had to be removed from the base if ANY wind & rain was expected.  I go out of my way to buy American made products but ...  Do yourself a favor and buy elsewhere ... Made in America (PA in this case)does not automatically guarantee good quality.  I wish I had taken the time to read the reviews before buying this bracket.	-1
Had it for 7 months and it broke at the base of the holder above the adjustment bracket during a moderate storm.	-1
I purchased this item on October 13, 2010.  I installed it on October 16th.  I was very pleased with it until, less than two months later, on December 12, 2010 I found my flag laying on the ground.  The adjustable portion of the casting had broken off at the base.  Needless to say, I would not recommend it to my friends.	-1
I can't give this flag holder too high of a rating:  1. Construction is mediocre - it feels like they've used the casting mold for WAY too long.  Things are measuring out of spec.  2. Included screws are too short.  These screws will not hold up a heavy pole, or if the pole is very long, or is the flag is very big and catches a lot of air.  I replaced these screws with some 4 inch stud screws instead.  It's a simple flag holder, and it's designed well.  It's a shame that the details were overlooked and the execution is shoddy.	-1
If I could give it zero stars, I would due to return policy. Non-returnable even as an add-on item. I previously bought this last year and misplaced it in my house. Found it after ripping the house apart for 2 days after ordering this one and found it. Now I'm stuck with something I don't need and money wasted.	-1
So Valley Forge makes THIS and the Six Foot Flag Pole with wall mount.  I bought the latter three years ago. And this year, the plastic wall mount broke.  So I ordered this metal one. BUT the holes to affix it to the building don't line up with the holes previously drilled for the plastic mount. BUGGER!!!  Who's in charge of that goat-rope at Valley Forge to not catch THIS?	-1
Brackets themselves seem just fine.  My main issue is that the screws provided to attach it are low quality, so low that the head would strip simply driving into ordinary pine or fir before they were in fully.  (Yes, I used the right size Philllips screwdriver.) .	-1
If you are going to use it for an American flag where the pole is pointing upwards it would be fine. But if you are going to use it for a banner flag that hangs horizontal then you will have to pad the opening as my flag was hanging at a downwards angle.	-1
The mount is a painted, cheap cast unit but should be fine for non-tornado use. The supplied screws however are indicative of some bulk China garbage. I'm a DIYer with enough tools to make sure that I'm using the proper size Philips head screw driver, but I'm not a monster that can drive nails with his fists. Ask screws stripped (x3) when applying medium pressure using first an electric drill, then a hand screwdriver. Basic treated deck wood, we're not talking concrete here folks. For the money, if you have your own screws, buy it and use THEM, as I had to. None on hand? Buy something else, you WILL not get the screws flush, rendering your mount useless.	-1
mine came broken otherwise I'm sure I would have liked it	-1
I like the flag pole holder, good quality.  I would have expected the screws and pole fastener to be made of stainless steel but all rusted out within 6 months.	-1
With slight wind the pole holder ripped out of a solid wood post secured with 4" long screws, took the flag & pole with it into my neighbors lawn. Needless to say I am no longer using this and tossed it.	-1
After one year the bolt has rusted to nothing.  This company needs to put in stainless steel screw bolts that don't rust.  After all these were made to be used outside.  I lived on a sailboat for 5 years and EVERYTHING had to be rust proof.  If you get this holder, buy a stainless steel bolt to replace the screw bolt that comes with it.	-1
If you live where there is no wind, this will work. Bent after two days and there was barely a breeze.	-1
Very nice holder for flag pole, I was replacing my old one that has been here for 30yrs and the screws do not line up for me to replace it. So I gave it to my nephew. He was very happy!	-1
shattered after a stiff breeze. I guess it's not built for weather	-1
Not adjustable	-1
I have a 3 X 5 foot flag on a 4 foot pole. This bracket is unsuitable for use in *any* wind over about 5 mph. Mine lasted a couple of days.  I ended up welding up my own pole bracket after being unable to find a suitable one for sale.	-1
junk	-1
Total piece of junk.  Even the photo shows the flag holder upside down so you know who you are dealing with.  My flags fall out, time after time. The silver side twists do not work; they don't even fit so you cannot secure your flags.	-1
This is one of the few amazon items I am returning- we didn't even open the package and can see the paint chipped off of it.	-1
sent it back, the was a defect in the forge process.	-1
I know we live in a Global economy and so we will use products made in other countries - especially China.  I don't blame China for taking jobs from America - I blame greedy American companies that move their production to China and move jobs that American families need to make an extra 2 cents profit.  Here is the quote from this products description; "Valley Forge Flag is committed to providing high-quality flags and accessories exemplifying our countrys national honor and spirit, raising its colors to express respect and pride for our American way of life."  Instead of telling us about Valley Forge Companies American Pride, try showing it.  But I also think the American public needs to support American companies better and so we need to go ahead and pay the 2 cents or 2 dollars more for products made in the USA.  I'm not a crazy isolationist, buying products from other countries is just a fact of life these days...BUT my American Flag and Flag holder needs to be made in America.	-1
This does keep squirrels away but not many birds come to this one. No bigger  bird. More and different kind come to the smaller one better. This one has the same problem of feed getting packed down in the tray after rain or snow. If you add feed frequently keep with the small one and if needed buy 2.	-1
Squirrels tore it. Up,bottom separated, even duck tape would not holdout,  The trash can held it well,  A real waste of money...  Wish it had worked. Out,,	-1
I definitely would not buy.	-1
Totally worthless if you have any other bird feeder in the yard. We have had this in our yard for 4 months and the food level has never dropped at all. We are continually refilling the other feeders. I even move it to about 3" off the ground and the squirrels won't go for it. They would rather feed off whatever has fallen on the ground. My conclusion is, compared to other feeders, the food is too far back, much harder to get out.	-1
Been a month, birds have not touched it!  Loaded it up with the same type of bird seed used in the previous (broken feeder) and zero customers so far	-1
I bought this and it is not like my roginal, plastic instead of metal. It arrived broken and when I tried to return, it does not allow me to return it.	-1
worthless, didn't work. was allwoing too much propane to go to our small grill and kept tripping the grills regulator. The advertising on this makes it seem like it will work with any grill. It sure doesnt work with ours and I wish I had kept the packaging so that I could return it!	-1
It did not last. Used it 3 times and 4th time it would not let gas through. Replaced with local company product that we have used a couple dozen times since	-1
Used three times last year. Brought it out this year and the hose is bad. Just like other reviews, it will not allow propane to flow. Stay away, this isn't cool for a lightly used product.	-1
This was an expensive investment and squirrels eat easily out of this feeder.  Very disappointed.	-1
This feeder is a great idea but poorly made or designed! Im sorry to say im returning it. I have a lot of birds to feed, so I need feeders that hold several lbs. of food and can accommodate 12+ birds at one time. The problem here is the 4 holes that empty seeds into the feeding tray are so small & narrow, nothing comes out! I end up having to replenish seeds in the tray once or twice a day by pouring more into the tray but not from the reservoir! For the high price, I expect the feeder to work as described, and I love the dome, but it doesnt work for winter feeding unless you have only 4 birds feeding and then they can sit at the openings and pull a few seeds out.	-1
Did not like this very expensive feeder. Cardinals weren't thrilled either and I used special seed. Squirrels came down along top of tube because they got over the little cap . I came home one day and found 2 squirrels stretched out stealing seed They prefer other brands of feeders that are cheaper but not so squirrelproof.	-1
Works well but the finish on the handle is very rough. It is sure to raise a blister. I'll be able to sand it but why should I have to complete the job that should have been done by the manufacturer. If I need another, I'll have to look elsewhere for better quality.	-1
Negative stars are needed to rate this! I thought this was the real thing. As soon as I opened the box I could see this was a cheap, unfinished tool. 2 1/2 inches of the point broke off in the first minute of use. I feel totally ripped off. The cheapest drug store garden tools are far superior.	-1
So disappointed in this feeder. No birds have used it yet, but the chipmunk is delighted. He crawls down the wire, stretches to the edge of the roof, gingerly reaches around the cover and latches onto the cage. From there he pulls himself down, crawls inside the cage and dines at his "personal" table! A Hairy woodpecker tried to get in once but couldn't, so left. It DOES keep big birds like starlings and grackles out, along with squirrels. I'm going to try putting the feeder out away from branches on a very tall shepherd's hook to see if the chipmunk leaves it alone. The shepherd's hook has a squirrel baffle so critters cannot crawl up beyond it to access the feeder.	-1
I loved this feeder when I received it. Quality all the way. After a few months of using there are squirrels in it almost all the time. The wiring holes are too big and they are chewing the feeding ports and ruining a beautiful feeder. Sorry guys this may keep the grackles out but the squirrels are feasting. At first I gave it a 5+ but not now.  Thanks	-1
We purchased this feeder for our smaller winter migrating birds, but we've discovered that they don't like to use it. It seems that they don't like that there's no solid bottom to the feeder as we have a similar feeder that does have one & they all crowd into that one & avoid this one. So we stopped using it. Otherwise, the quality is excellent.	-1
the cage really keeps the squirrel out???	-1
The perch is plastic that easily broke during assembly. I returned it for a refund, not a replacement, because if it breaks that easily a squirrel could break it in short order.  When they design a perch that doesn't break so easily I will buy it because the rest of the design is genius.	-1
Cardinals did not feed at this bird feeder. Cardinals are the main bird I want to attract. Returned. It's a high quality product though and squirrels could not get to the feeder. 1 star because cardinals don't like it but 5 stars for quality and the squirrel proof factor.	-1
I have a large cardinal population and they won't fly to it.  They don't want to put their heads in those tiny holes.  But it is good for the other smaller birds.  I'm still on the hunt for a cardinal bird feeder.	-1
DIFFICULT TO PRAISE A SQUIRREL PROOF PRODUCT WHEN YOU HAVE TWO  SQUIRRELS  INSIDE OF THE UNIT EATING TO THEIR HEARTS CONTENT.  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SQUIRRELS AND WANT TO KEEP THE BIG BIRD OUT THIS WILL WORK. OUT SIDE OF THAT NOT WORTH THE TIME EFFORT OR MONEY	-1
birds do not go to the inside circle to eat it has little value	-1
I have the smaller squirrel buster but wanted one that would attract cardinals, so I got this one because of the round rim that cardinals like to feed from.  I had an old one at the same location with the same seed that the cardinals like, but now I have only seen one after a month.  Finches don't even seem to like it.  I would not buy again.	-1
Bought this about 4 years ago from another site (much more expensive). It worked well. The pole holding it gave out (wet soil from heavy rain and snow), and the feeder hit the ground (frozen grass). It literally smashed into about 10 pieces; I don't know if I even found them all.  The interesting part of this story is that the thistle feeder hanging on the opposite hook of the pole and 2 poly rain rings (over the tops)  did NOT break. Only this feeder broke!! I suspect that it was either weather-worn, OR an old(ER) feeder with limited life to the plastic, OR that it was made of poor cheap material originally.  A few feet away, I also had a large barn-type feeder on a pole which was not effected (anchored in cement), i.e., NOT attacked by an animal which the company seemed to want to blame: an animal attack.  I wrote MANY times to the mfg for replacement. FINALLY, they said that an animal probably got at it, but they couldn't guess which one. DUH. I said that the other pieces which fell did NOT break, AND that the other barn style feeder, only a few feet away, was not touched, basically ruling out an animal attack in my simple assessment.  Last email from mfgr: Their policy was that they could NOT replace the entire feeder!? I asked about the lifetime warrantee again. They asked for photos. I sent them.  Then they asked what pieces were intact and which were broken. I wrote that they'd just have to look at the pix because I had never taken the feeder apart and could not say. Answer: NO REPLACEMENT; must have been an animal attack (their words).  BOTTOM LINE: Forget the lifetime support. They won't replace the feeder. Be ware of expecting any type of replacement or support from the company. The emails were almost accusative; really off-putting, as if to discourage further contact. And I had shown them a photo of the pole AND the other elements on it which did not break. We exchanged probably half a dozen emails.  I'd like this feeder again, but I'll be d....d if I spend money on something which is NOT supported when the mfgr says that it is supported for a lifetime replacement.  Whose lifetime? An ant's?  Probably made of SHODDY MATERIAL with a limited life is my conclusion. The company will insist that "some" animal attacked it, and they don't support animal attacks. Great excuse (not).	-1
Hi price was intimidating, but based on the reviews.... I bought it anyway.  I HATE it,  I don't get ANY birds... have tried different food,  different placement, different spring setting,,, including the least sensitive at all.... and I can  not get any birds to eat out of it at all,  never even see any land on it.... Wish I had kept teh packaging, because for the price I would definatey return it.... Now it wi become a lesson learned and good will donation.....	-1
The birds in my back yard here in Baton Rouge, LA avoided this thing like the plague. I gave it about 3 weeks and returned it.	-1
There is no doubt this is a great idea.  Here in South Florida the weather does a number on plastic parts so when my cardinal ring broke after 5 months, I needed to get another one.  I wish I could just BUY one, but apparently I cannot.  I have to write the company etc, etc, etc.  I mean just sell the damn part and be done with it.  It does work well when I can use it.  We will see how long it takes to get the part.  Geez!	-1
THis is a nice feeder. If your squirrels aren't particularly aggressive it might work for you. However, they easily can knock it off the pole/branch and eat the seed off the ground. Another issue I have is with moisture and sometimes FUR (YUCK) getting in the feeder holes, thus defeating the whole purpose. I was too frustrated & had to throw it away. Also, one time the top wasn't secure and the squirrel literally crawled into the tube. I saw him eating and was just amazed at his feat. Hand to God.	-1
Initially I was pleased as it rid me of the grackles. However taking this apart and then reassembling after cleaning  became a  dubious chore. Alas finally getting it all back together the lever controls for the individual feed stations seem to no  longer function. I give up!	-1
This comes close.. but not close enough. The company is great. I have ordered several replacement parts after squirrels have torn it apart. I have had this feeder for 5+ years. Here's the problem: the cardinal ring.. when the ring is attached, squirrels EASILY poke their heads from underneath and feed from the port holes at will.. if Brome would do as I'd suggested.. and make the cardinal ring SOLID all the way through, this feeder would be squirrel proof. As it stands now, the feeder is useless.. without the cardinal ring, cardinals cannot feed from this feeder. And yes, I have a squirrel baffle below the feeder.. they still feed at will 24x7.. all they do is poke their heads from underneath and feed.. then when I remove the ring, the cardinals cannot feed+ the squirrels simply tear the feeder apart. I have replaced the base 10+ times in 5 years.. the company is great to deal with.. but should listen to my idea about making the cardinal ring a SOLID aluminum or steel, lightweight, piece.	-1
For everyone out there that is an avid bird feeding enthusiast, you are by now well aware that you will spend half your time selecting seed, buying feeders, setting up and tending to them, and the other half battling squirrels for control of them. Squirrel's are nothing less than amazing in both their tenacity and technique when it comes to getting at the bird seed we desire so desperately to keep them away from.  Squirrel baffles of all shapes and design are only effective about half the time at best. And weight sensitive perches are soon made obsolete or at least only partially effective when word gets around as to how to hang down from above and keep your body weight elsewhere. This very expensive squirrel buster is really nothing but a little better design on an old idea.  The weight sensitive perch is nothing new.  Its been in the arsenal of attack on squirrels for quite a few years now.  A weight sensitive perch is only as effective as what's overhead for the wily squirrel to hang his feet on and drop below.  The squirrel buster does just about as good a job at making the top of its feeder pretty near paw proof as I have encountered, but not totally.  My neighbor who owns one of these has seen quite a few squirrels attempt to drop from above to the seed below only to slip and fall, (much to her giggling delight).  However not a day goes by that some future Olympian worthy fellow somehow manages to lock his feet above securely and feast on the spoils now at his disposal below. Now that she has had it for a few weeks it has become an everyday event that at least a couple of squirrels beat the system. Its my opinion that there is no such thing as a foolproof squirrel busting feeder.  This one is close, but at the price their asking for it I don't consider it a worthwhile investment at all. Take away its design and its no better made than any other feeder costing half its price.  It will get just as dirty and is just as hard to clean.  Its all up to the individual of course.  But its my take that this feeder is extremely overpriced regardless of its promise and performance.  If you are interested in a feeder that is every bit as squirrel proof as this one and is about a third the price, try the Backyard Bistro bird feeder available on the web.  I own 5 of them and they are made of very tough impenetrable vinyl and aluminum and its shape and hardness makes it just as effective against squirrels as the buster here. You can even buy six of these in a case for the price of two of these feeders, and with free shipping thrown in.  Check it out and see for yourself.  And happy hunting!	-1
I have 3 of these feeders and they do a very good job of defeating the squirrels, raccoon etc.  However they are not very good at keeping the seed dry.  Rain enters the feeder through the top and it gets in the feeding holes; a couple of days after a rain storm the seed in the feeding ports will be spoiled, and the bird stay away.  We put squirrel domes on the top of these feeders - stop rain from getting into the feeder tube.  However feeding hole still get wet and the food will spoil - you need to clean out the feeder holes after every rain.	-1
The birds don't like it at all....I saw about four just sit at the feeder and try to figure out what they were supposed to do.  I think one of the birds actually flipped me off for getting this.  If you don't tighten the lid and bottom secure enough the bird seed will spill ALL over your floor, and it's amazing how quickly a full bird feeder will empty on the ground.  I would have to say that I can't see how a squirrel would get to the food...I will say that about it.  But what good is it if the birds don't get to it either?  I'll probably go back to one of the others and just feed the squirrels with the birds.	-1
My 1 star is actually for Amazon.com. I have no idea how this product performs. I guess that if you look at the back of the box, it has a map of the United States and the bottom half uses this product. The top half uses Octenol, a different chemicle. I wish Amazon would have told me this because now I am stuck in New York with a product that will not do me any good. Amazon wants me to pay for return shipping, and will deduct the original "free" shipping charges, all because of their mistake.  1 star for amazon.	-1
Did not work for me. Attracted no Asian Tiger Mosquitos	-1
Doesn't work in Texas very well - the whole contraption should of yielded hundreds of mosquitos - no I got 15-20.  After running for 30 days...BOOO.	-1
Save your money a piece of worthless junk not worth the plastic and metal it took to make, will not  cut twiggs nor will the chain stay on, amazon sholud be ashame to offer such garbage	-1
Crappy design, the extension didn't work (free spin) and the oil didn't feed to the chain.  I think they may need to rethink the design on this one-	-1
this is the third gas powered, chain saw pole attachment that I have owned. This one failed very soon after purchase and was a total waste of money. I am sure Amazon would have taken it back but i just never returned it!	-1
After looking at product it looks like it was a returned used product. It was shipped in a hand made box. It did not have an instruction manual. It had oil in oil tank. And after looking it over, I noticed wood chips behind chain guard. I thought and believed I was buying a NEW pole saw.	-1
DOES NOT FIT A WEED EATER. my weed eater has a square cable operating system, but this attachment is not compatible. My model has a plastic threaded fastener and this unit only attaches with a single round tension pin. Waiting on return label.   Beware of comments. One comment said the box listed as compatible with weed eater, box does not list weed eater. UPDATE. Amazon promptly refunded my account for this Item. Amazon's Customer Service is why I am a return customer.	-1
No good. Get a Remnenton Gass that is 5 star.	-1
Piece of junk but I put it in an area where it won't matter when it falls apart. You get what you pay for.	-1
This is cheap made I had gotten one two years ago at the dollar store for 8 bucks that was more of a value than this, It comes with a tool to help put holes in the ground to install the legs and its flimsy and makes putting the holes in the ground very difficult for this price that should be better made. The plastic holders are cheap and the two ornaments on the top are plastic and cheap I though they were metal.  Its cute in the garden but don't expect to last long Id not put anything that would be there for years, I was going to do roses but decided to go with morning glories.  If I had it to do over again Id not buy this.	-1
I got this in the mail, when needed right after a big snow storm, to find it had none of the hardware, no support brackets, not bolts to hook each section together, pretty much making it worthless. Now I need to go through the hassle of returning it.	-1
I bought one of these, retail, at a local hardware store.  The box came without instructions inside.  When I attempted to use it the shovel assembly cracked and broke.  Turns out the unit was supposed to come with some braces and bolts for them.  No braces, no bolts and no instructions that would have explained this.  The pictures on the outside box do not clearly show the braces.  When I e-mailed the company for support they offered to send the braces and bolts at no charge.  At the same time the response stated:  "I am sorry that the two braces were not in the carton when you purchased the roof rake, however, why would you use an item that is missing parts and not realize that you might do damage to the rest of the unit?"  Gee, had the unit INCLUDED DIRECTIONS or ALL OF ITS PARTS then maybe I'd have had a chance to use it correctly.  Just who's running their support department that thinks it's OK to insult a customer like that?  Yeesh.  Fortunately the local hardware store is good about their return policies.  I returned it.  I would have swapped it out but not after getting that kind of response from the factory.  No way I'd want to buy another one from a company that lets their support people respond in that manner.  So I'm buying an all-metal Garelick one instead.  I've got a number of other Garelick products on our boat and they make reliable products.  I strongly encourage everyone else to AVOID Suncast products.	-1
After the first couple of seasons and few dozen pruning sessions, its drive jams very easily. Unlike some other B&D tools, this trimmer is not sold for appreciably less without a battery.  The NPP2018R pole saw 3.5ft extension is compatible with this trimmer. Compatible with other B&D 18V drills, string trimmers, pole saws the battery needs frequent recharging for this trimmer.  B&D's provided 18V NiCd battery and charger are not very good; I recommend the ExpertPower 18v 3000mAh NiMh battery with Black & Decker BDFC240 charger.  A replacement blade assembly (p/n 5145128-00) costs about $52 with shipping; the similar-appearing LPHT120 blade assembly costs about half that. Assuming similar durability; that trimmer could cost less over the long term, but the LPHT120 replacement blade (p/n 90568531) is listed as having limited availability or obsolete, on some websites.	-1
This is a terrific tool. Sadly after one season of use the motor burns out. The B&D store replaced it twice under warranty & said that was it. So this year when I used it the 1st time, you guessed it, the motor started to burn. Dn't think I'll replace it & will make do with a weed wacker, not nearly so versatile.	-1
<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Black-Decker-NPT318-18-Volt-Cordless-Electric-Pole-Hedge-Trimmer/dp/B0007NP05U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Black & Decker NPT318 18-Volt Cordless Electric Pole Hedge Trimmer</a>  I purchased this on 5/31/2011 and received around 6/2/2011. First time I used it there were no issues. However the 2nd time the motor burned up and the way the switch is wired it is a safety hazard. Because I am disabled I depend on my grandson. Just as the honey suckle limbs were being cut smoke and sparks started coming out. Once you pull the trigger you are required to pull back on a 2nd switch which locks the trimmer in the run condition. It was so hot he could not cut it off. This is a safety hazard in that what if he caught his paints or finger. This is a very dangerous piece of equipment and need to be recalled. You never lock or bypass a safety device when someone is using it. So needless to say that was a bad deal. SO BUYER PLEASE BE AWARE.	-1
I had to return this iem due to the fact the motor burned out after 2 days of work. B&D under power thier tools. Black and Deck tools are the Walmart of tools,cheaply made.	-1
UPDATE:  it is ok on small stiff hedges and dead grass, but does NOT work well on tall green grass. It is heavy, weak, and the battery does not last that long. NOT recommended: get a corded one instead.  ==================================================================== I hate string trimmers, so I tried this as an alternative. I am pleased.  Its clean, quite, and works well on tall, thick grass. The adjustable blade angle is important, I used it mostly at 90 degrees, but some at 45 degrees. Its heavy, and its a bit awkward "upside down" as a grass trimmer. I'm tall, and the length is just about right for me. Still, probably get tired faster than with a regular trimmer.  My assessment as a weed eater:  Pros good with tall thick grass clean quiet less damage to surroundings  Cons heavy awkward limited battery life plus slow charger  minus 1 star for ergonomics, otherwise looks very good	-1
I purchased this because my arms would burn from holding my regular electric trimmer above my head, well this helps with the reach but it weighs at least 3 times as much as the electric version. Wish this one was electric at least that would eliminate the battery weight. It's also a little awkward to handle because of the weight and balance but it does reach where my normal one doesn't. I use my normal trimmer to do 90% of the work and then pull this out for those hard to reach places.  So just be ready for the extra weight, I was rather shocked and it I would have seen this in a store I probably would not have got it for that reason.	-1
Update: Stopped working effectively after about 16 hours of use.  James on a twig slightly larger than a matchstick and then makes a whining noise and a nice electric burning smell until I whack it with my hand a few times, then it'll work in a promising manner until you actually bring the blade to bear on a hedge.  I've found that the cutting bar is so flimsy you can bend it permanently without much effort.  Might be why its jamming all the time.  Might be interesting to try to bend it to a semi circle for custom cutting before I jam it into the garbage can...  No power, fibber marketing guys, impractical for anything other than marginal light duty work here and there.  Very first piece of outdoor equipment that I've bought that just stopped working after a short usage period.  Maybe i've been fortunate. --------------------  original review:  I'll say something good first.  Its not the worst hedge trimmer i've used. (update: yes it is)  That having been said, the box shows that its ten feet long, and after fiddling with it for 15 minutes trying to figure out how to extend it and reading the manual twice, i came to the conclusion that this includes the height of the person holding it.  Love the marketing spin...  The cutting end is a good 7-8 lbs.  Try holding that at an angle on the end of the (actually) four foor pole for a while.  Would have been brilliant to put the motor on the bottom and some kind of actuation through the pole and just the blade on top.  The specs say it'll cut almost a half inch.  Not exactly.  Anything about a third of an inch or so will stop the blade dead.  Now you've got a heavy cutter on the end of a long pole stuck on a branch.  If you're lucky, you're also on a ladder.  Not worth a hundred bucks.	-1
The motor quit after a couple of months. Not happy with this purchase.	-1
The saw itself is good, tension is easy to set, nice little scabard to go with. Long enough.  The battery is simply unusable. 18v that takes 9.6 hours to charge? Then lasts all of 20 minutes? I have two Dewalt 18-volt XRP batteries that each go all day on a single charge running an impact driver and radial saw, then charge in about 15-20 minutes from dead. Why can't this B&D battery even come close to that?? There's only a $10-15 difference between the Dewalt and B&D battery.  So this saw is only good for very occassional trimming, and just a few cuts before its done for the day (literally).	-1
Don't waste your money on this. All though the trimmer works,the battery last for 15-20 min. under light use. Purchased a back up battery,same issue. With a 9 hour charge time, can not complete any task. Go electric or gas.	-1
Enough said: the first one lasted for 3 rather light usages and then completely died (it wasn't the battery, and I had to drive for 45 minutes each way to return and have it exchanged), got a new one under warranty, that lasted for one use. Unbelievable.	-1
I am very concerned that this product is defective in some way. After using several times the trigger mechanism started sticking and would not turn off. I am pretty sure that having a pole saw that will not turn off can be pretty dangerous. However, I continued to use to complete my job at hand. About half way through cutting a limb the chain gets stuck and because I could not turn the product off the motor began to smoke. Now, I have a 14 foot pole saw that doesnt work. Very upset with my experience here.	-1
Here's the problem. Because it's an alarm, they designed it to be intrusion proof. But realistically, the majority of people buying this are those worried about their kids, and unlikely some burglar taking a midnight dip. And here in lies the problem. You need this little red magnet every time you take it out to go swim AND... AND PUT IT IN! Why the heck does this thing alarm when I put it back in? The simple chirp it does is all we need.  Overall it functions well. I had one false alarm so far this season on a very windy day and I don't fault the product for that. I don't think it's long enough either. We have a typical in ground pool with normal water level height. They recommend 4 inches submerged, and the best I can get when my pool as at recommend water level is 3. They say minimum of 2.5... so yeah.  If it wasn't $200 I might not be so critical, however it just makes simple hops in the pool a pain. There could have easily been a remote on/off tied to the remote alarm, or maybe even a model option with a button on the unit itself to disarm. Sure, sell the intrusion proof model for those worried about burglars swimming in their pool, but for the rest of us just worried about getting distracted and having a kid fall in, just give us a button so we can pop in and out of the pool without going to grab a key!	-1
Very disappointed. The pin that secures the alarm to the deck was missing. An integral piece of the equipment. Not disappointed with Amazon but with PoolGuard, who should have checked their product for parts before shipping. There are only 4 parts... It would not have been that difficult.	-1
Crap	-1
Rated tops in In-Ground Pool Alarms.  It may be but we were not willing to drill a hole in the pool surround to mount it and find out.  Only the box shows it has a stabilizing "pin".  Its existence is not described anywhere pre-purchase.  After buying the product, you either see the pin mentioned on the box or open it up and then find what is the thickness of a nail, not a pin, which must fit in a drilled hole.  We were really disappointed.  I think it used to be made without the pin but could be wrong. Don't know where to go from here.	-1
The design of this device is such that there is a larger than needed gap between the pool surface and the device, because the wheels are too big or mounted too low. So the large gap makes it so it doesn't do a very good job sucking things up. Returned.	-1
The product contained oil within it and could not even get them off, definitely can't use in a pool. I returned it therefore cannot be recommended for any pools.	-1
Would not recommend this duck for your hot tub.  Rides high in water, turns over.  Really a west of money	-1
Rain barrels have been used for centuries. I am glad people are resuming the use of these practical devices. But, c'mon, $135 for a simple low-tech plastic barrel? I KNOW I can find a source for these at under $25.	-1
Yes it catches bugs, but it catches more of the smaller non biting flying millers, not that many mosquitoes and the mosquitoes it does catch are not killed and when you go to empty the tray a lot of them escape. I would not recommend.	-1
Quit working after second use!	-1
Worked great at first but then the power pack died after only 2 months of use.	-1
I am not entirely sure this works.  there are very few bugs even after almost 3 weeks of use.  Husband still says he got bit by bug.  I don't notice many bites.  But I'm not convinced this big ugly thing is really doing its job.	-1
This was set up in a fly filled house.  Both fruit flies and regular house fly's.  It operated 24/7 for a week, all the while we were battling these pests.  I decided to empty the trap, thinking it must surely be full by now. It was dead empty.  Literally, not even dust!  For those that say something about placement, this was in the middle of the room with the most problems, on a counter at medium height (so literally, middle...height included).  We killed hundreds with a basic fly swatter during this time....this thing trapped and killed an alarmingly amount of zero, even though by the sheer number of fly's one surely would have climbed into the thing on it's own accord and by accident.  This device seemed to actually scare them away.  I returned, and the process was hassle free.  There were no arguments, no problems.  Although it did take prompting them a month after they received the product in order to get the money sent back. They paid shipping. At least there is that....	-1
This design is garbage, i had one of these for about 1.5 years, it did not kill or trap anything. Do not buy this!	-1
Does not work on flies at all , mosquitios a few but the fan is so weak that a spider started making a web inside the housing and the spider web catches more that the device does .	-1
I like the concept, but this product does not deliver. Did not catch gnats, fruit flies, house flies or anything else after almost a month of non-stop use. Had to pay return shipping and that just adds insult to injury. Extremely disappointed. Do not buy.	-1
Moths in house, but none ever in the trap; ran several days and nights??? Ended up killing moths with a rolled up newspaper.	-1
No good.  Mosquitos fly by looking at the pretty purple light... not a single one ever caught.	-1
Didn't work very well. Killed a few gnats. On the noisy side Replacement bulbs aren't cheap	-1
after running it 3-4 days, I was lucky to get a few bugs captured...they're still flying around my patio area.	-1
I deployed this item as suggested in the manual.  It was in a dark portion of our RV and I ran it 24/7 for a couple of weeks.  Barely caught anything and we had plenty of insect flying in and out of the RV over this period.	-1
Seems like this pulls a lot of electricity.  Hasn't caught too many insects considering that I have had it running almost non-stop for a month.  Caught 1 fly, some mosquitos and mainly gnats.  I wanted to return it but it is past the date to return it.  The light bulb is already starting to burn out.  This wasn't worth the money I spent on it.  The drawer is hard to get back in once it is pulled out, very cheaply made in China.  Not too impressed.	-1
Excellent for SMALL bugs; but, not for large ones.  The large house flies are strong enough to be able to escape being drawn into the trap.	-1
Returned it. Defected. Blew out and not in, blowing bugs away and not sucking them up! Idea is clever if t had worked.	-1
Did not like the item too loud	-1
I just bought this while in a rush.  I should have paid more attention to the reviews that said it is noisy.  This is quite loud!  I will use it for a while, as I am desperate to get rid of some gnats and fruit flies.  However, when my other electric bug zapper is back in stock I will purchase another one of those.	-1
VN designed, quiet, quality construction, and conceptually a perfect lure to capture brown moths in our home in NJ. Unfortunately, didn't capture a single moth over a 3 month period while the sex lure stickie strips were highly successful. I should have returned the unit...worthless.	-1
It sort of works out of thousands of Flies it caught maybe 5. As for how well it works with Miskitos I could not say we got it because it was supposed to work good on flies.	-1
Very disappointed in this. I've recently been eating a lot more fruit, and as a result I have noticed more fruit flies in my kitchen. I thought this would be a good solution, but after a couple days when I pulled the trap out to check results, there was nothing in it. The problem is that the mesh size used is so large that the small flies can wiggle right through.  I had a trap like this years ago from Sharper Image and that worked great.  The only difference is really the mesh size.  I considered going out to purchase some finer mesh to add in, but I don't think i should have to do that myself.	-1
I had this thing on top of my fridge and on all day and night for 3 days.  it did not catch a thing while 3 feet away the cheap glued traps caught a dozen moths in the same amount of time.	-1
I bought this for fruit flies, gnats, and mosquitos. Actually anything flying in the house. Here is the issue, first you need to have this ugly thing 3 feet off the ground and in a dark room. Its not too noisy but it makes a fan sound.  The major flaw in the whole design is that it just lets them right out. As others said, a small gnat will escape along with small mosquitos. I tested this now for over a month and checked the cage daily. It would have a bug in it and then hours later I would check again and it was gone. This kept happening so it is just useless. The only thing I can see this being helpful for is house flies but they never flew in it.	-1
This trap has been running for several days and has only caught gnats and a moth. It is loud and very cheaply made. I would not recomend this product to anyone. The more expensive ones mays work better but this is useless.	-1
A friend couldn't sell this at his garage sale so he gave it to us. After a brief trial it's going somewhere other than inside our house. It is loud and ineffective. When you empty the tray, many of what little bugs are in it fly out. I'm going to buy another electric zapper for my kitchen. We live in the country and it is unreal how many insects make it into the house. A zapper does the a good job of keeping the house pest free.	-1
My first Nosquito trap ran, steadily, for at least 8 years, in an enclosed patio.  I did use the replacement bulb, which came with it, and the whole unit died, right after the bulb was installed. My second unit was purchased in 2011, and lasted just a few months, before the fan died. I'm getting another unit, only because there's nothing else, out there, for anywhere near the price. I'll let you know how that goes;).	-1
I bought this thinking it would be an indoor bug zapper. What it is a light with a fan that's suppose to draw the bugs in with the light into a compartment they can't get out of. It does not work!	-1
I bought one of these last summer.  It caught maybe a dozen or so bugs the entire season.  I went to turn it on this spring and the bulb started flickering, then went out.  I thought it was the bulb and ordered a replacement, but it doesn't work either.  The fan runs, but the bulb won't light.  I had the exact same problem with a Stinger outdoor bug zapper; it quit working after just a single season.	-1
returning only worked two nights	-1
Ordered this for a big party we were having -- delivered as advertised. After reading instructions and hanging the unit, all worked great - for 2 hours - the light went out!!!  Followed troubleshooting tips - no luck.  Am returning it but am not sure what bug "zapper" to order. Other reviews seem to indicate this Stinger model has some quality control problems as my unit and a few others seem to have short lifespans with the lite not working. Amazon has a great return program for such occasions - that is why I keep using them.	-1
You can find bulbs for these everywhere. Bulbs for the Flowtron are harder to find. There is a reason for that: These bulbs burn out much faster and seems to lose their intensity much faster as well. I've had Flowtron's last years and years. Bulbs lasting 2-5 years, ballasts lasting 3-7 years. Stingers? The bulb rarely makes it past a year and ballasts about 3 years. I bought 2 Stingers during the last 10 years. Both performed about the same. I bought about 10 Flowtons and all but one lasted 2-3 times longer.	-1
I bought this product from home depot. Electric grid the first time lasted 4 weeks. I did all the necessary trouble shooting and no solution. I return it to home depot and got a brand new one fresh out the box. This time it only lasted two weeks. You got to be kidding me. I got stung by mosquito the whole summer. Either this product is really really bad or the bugs in my back yard sabotage it. I should of read other people comments on this before I bought it because I am not the only one experiencing this. I am buying different type of zapper with better rating. for get this ultra crappy thing.	-1
I bought two of these at a Walmart three years ago and one lasted only one season then just crapped out.  Got it replaced free cause I lied about how long I had it then the second one crapped out also...was not able to get that one replaced.  The first one finally gave out as well.  They worked so good when they worked but both went out on me.  And it was not the bulb...tried replacing the bulb but finally had to go with a different brand that did not cover as much area though...we have a BIG yard.. The old ones last for years, what's up here?	-1
Stopped working after 3 hrs! This zapper is complete garbage. Won't work on anything larger than a misqiuto. Had a month infestation and it killed about 2 dozen then just quit workinbg. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
We bought this and the electric cord that comes out is only a few inches long and on top. Can't use without an extension cord which would look really stupid if used indoors in our living room. What a peiece of crap. One of the worse products ever purchased. Throwing it in trash, will never buy a Stinger brand product ever again as long as I live. Totally stupid design.	-1
In my area the only brand of bug zapper that any storefront sold was Stinger.  Each and every one of these bug zappers has failed in 1 year or less.  Some burn out with the bulb still working but not zapping any longer.  The others have failed where the ballast fails and even a new bulb (at $20) obviously won't work.  Of course you don't know it's the ballast until you fork out the $20 for a new bulb and find out the zapper is shot.  Save yourself the grief and stay away from the Stinger brand all together.  Go with the Flowtron and you'll be a much happier person.  Flowtron zappers actually work, don't plug up like the Stinger brand, and when the light quits working its almost certainly just the bulb and not the entire zapper that needs replacing.	-1
It worked for 3 months, now the grid is dead. No voltage between the grids. the grid is clean (have to blow it out regularly- canned air works). The bulb that came with it burned out in about 30 days.  Not recommended.	-1
I have bought 3 over a 2 year period. The all failed due to defective starters. They do not self clean like the flowtrons and are always clogging.	-1
I tried the 1/2 acre and 1 acre versions.  The light attracts tons of bugs, but the grids rarely zap one.  The bugs fly around in there like crazy.  I put a white plastic bucket under each one.  After 2 hours there was only a handful of dead bugs in each bucket, even though there were clouds of bugs flying into each unit.	-1
I purchased one of these exact rain gauges about 5 years ago.  If I had not left the glass in over winter this year I would still have it.  I needed the new glass only, however it was less money to order the whole unit with another item and get free shipping.  Nice brass piece, however in less than two weeks the paint is flaking off the glass tube. Give me a break!  That is the most important part.  The old glass had what appeared to be baked on mearsurments and made it through almost 5 years, this is just paint - bet ya' done in China now to save a few cents.  I woud return this, but not worth the money.  Don't waste your money like I did.  Cheap parts like this loose customers.....I'll have to figure out how to fix before all the marking are gone.  I won't even bother to get just the glass from this company as I am sure it is the same junk!	-1
product does kink..so never say never	-1
I have owned this for about 4 - 5 years and cannot tell you how much I dislike it. The hopper door does not operate consistently and either dumps my material out or gums up while being towed resulting in areas not being spread to. Not this unit's fault, but my new scag tiger cat is much larger than my freedom z resulting in difficulties reaching the control handle; not that the numbers correlate to anything meaningful as the door will either not open at all or comes completely open even while set at the lower feed rate buttons. One other problem I have unfortunately noticed is that the unit is severely top-heavy. Be careful executing turns when loaded as this unit's wheels are not sufficiently set far enough apart to keep it from turning over dumping your material out.	-1
Anyone who's seen my reviews know I'm a stickler for decent instructions and documentation. So this product had earned THREE stars just from the assembly ordeal. That was before it even hit the turf.  It comes with quite substantial spreader settings documentation for fertilizer and seed. But the assembly instructions consisted of a set of pictures for parts and assembly. There were no written directions. There was a scanner symbol on the front page with instructions directing you to a free Showuhow mobile app for further instructions, but I couldn't find the app for my android.  I found video instructions online but not at address shown on the outside of the box. It was located here: [...]  Since the volume of the video was too low to hear on my phone I did the assembly near a desktop. In the video each part is described by number, but it's not the part number, nor do they match up with the paper illustrations which are labeled with alphabets.  Assembly didn't go smoothly even with the video because the parts fitted together poorly, which is why you have to leave the screws loose during assembly, tightening them later. Further the control assembly seemed to be backwards and came apart while trying to attach it.  In operation I loaded some bermuda grass "one step complete" seed to spread around where needed. The control assembly was literally INOPERATIVE. I could close the opening with it, but not open it. In fact part of the plastic slide that opens and shuts the bottom of the bin had broken off. As it was totally useless, I had to manually open and close it.  All in all, it was an ordeal from assembly to operation.	-1
wheel base too short. Prone to tipping	-1
The assembly was relatively easy but things went down from there. The spreader adjustment switch is very flimsy and tough to use. The biggest flaw with this product is that the vetical axle that the spreader wheel spins on does not have any agitator on the end that's inside the hopper. This means that if the material you are spreading has any chunks in it, the hoper will clog requiring you to stop and fix it and resulting in very uneven application.  I have 1 acre lawn so I wanted something I could connect to my Craftsman YT2000. This spreader connects just fine and when it isn't clogged, does a decent job on level ground but pulling it across any kind of incline is a pain. The front of my yard is on an incline and going across the front lawn, the spreader would frequently clog and on one occasion it tipped over spreading about 30 lbs of lime pellets onto my lawn... that wasn't fun to clean up..  This is one of those cases where I should have spent a little more money for a more solid product.	-1
The axle end that goes into the wheel is bent into a shape that won't fit into the wheel. Tried a rubber hammer to tap it in and the axle started to split. Now it's stuck.  Axle is busted. And I'm sure the wheel bearings are too, if I try to pull it out. Awesome.	-1
Updating my review - purchased this unit Nov 2014. The control cable no longer functions (this unit was also stored in dry, out of weather) and since I am within 1 year warranty, tried to get a replacement part. I tried Amazon first,  punted me to the manufacture Agri-Fab (which I understand so I'm not upset with Amazon). Contacted Agi-Fab online form (per their site), forget that, never got a response, submitted again today. At this point I'd purchase the part to get it operational again. Avoid this frustration. I'm sure I can find a cable local and make work, but shouldn't have to go that route.	-1
Peice of junk only lasted one day . I had to drill my own holes it it to put it together . Should have bought one from Tractor supply like my wife wanted too. Amazon Verified Purchase	-1
Didn't care for the quality and overall operation. Sent it back.	-1
Arrived with parts missing	-1
What, no zero stars?  I've had this spreader for a few years.  It tips on turns, and dumps your load on the lawn, which leaves a big dead spot in the lawn -- even if you try sucking up all the spill with a shop vac attached to a couple extension cords.  Worse than that, the gearing is weak plastic, probably the same as used in walk behind units spreading much less product per load.  Might last one or two seasons, or not, before the gearing fails.  You can buy replacement gearing, and repeat the process -- however, crummy replacement gearing of the same low quality cost about $30, plus an hour of time to replace, and don't last any longer than the first set of gears.  Basically,  you're really losing money in the long run.  Either buy a more durable unit, or go to a smaller push unit and pay more per small bag of fertilizer spread AND you have to push it.  If you've got an acre or more, that's a total BS waste of time...  Avoid, if you really want something that works.  Same thing applies to other similarly equipped tow-behind units...  They ought to either take this POS off the market or figure how to provide it with decent gearing that will last ten years or more, like the bigger units have.	-1
This hose kinks constantly. I only bought it a month or so ago. It truly sucks but I'm giving it two stars because water comes out of it consistently.	-1
kinks up too easy	-1
Commercial grade hose? It got a swell blister about halfway, and the water pressure here is about 35psi. JUNK	-1
Kinks very easily, hard to roll back up	-1
leaks on year 2	-1
The hose, like most garden hoses, does it job and it looks fairly nice.  Unfortunately, mine does not recoil well on the hose hangout.  I had a 50 ft garden hose for 27 years that coiled very nicely before it finally developed a leak.  I wish I knew who manufactured it.  I personally would rather have a hose that coils without curling than have a never-kink hose that is too stiff.  A balance for me is preferred.  UPDATE: I was hoping the summer hot weather would relax the hose yielding a tamer, more compliant re-coiling profile.  Didn't happen.  I did find that allowing the hose to bake for about 30 min with full water pressure helps.  But, the hose eventually goes back to it's original form factor and becomes unwieldy on the hose hangout.  I don't like the hose at all and would return it if it hadn't been so long.	-1
Too heavy and kink. Hard to carry around. Expensive to much for female gardener. I am not able to drug around to water my flower beds.	-1
I am so mad, I'm going to put it on the trash pick-up. I will only get rubber from now on. The makers should be ashamed to advertise it as never kink.	-1
I have bought less costly hoses that perform better. I was disappointed in this product. Don't Reccommend. I will stick with the rubber instead.	-1
For under 6 or 7 years of age at most. Cheaply made.	-1
It's "child size" and that's a give away that it's really a toy. Maybe the one I got doesn't work right or maybe it's the soil conditions here, but I couldn't find anything I didn't already know was there. I have owned high-end metal detectors in the past and bought a cheap one just to locate nails in the pasture. I could find a nail if I placed one on top the ground and placed the center of the head directly on the nail, but if I moved it off just a half inch, nothing. Maybe for a child it would be a lot of fun.	-1
One is better off buying a better detector. It detected, but many times it was a false detection.	-1
I am a big fan of the Bounty Hunter line, however I think they cheaped out on this model. Wasnt very accurate and my kids didn't enjoy the hassle of having to stay at each holw for so long. I finally caved and bought the next step up and couldn't be happier. Was only $30 more and works like top of the line model machine. If anyone is interested, here is the link. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002J1LNO?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B0002J1LNO&linkCode=xm2&tag=jrsqe-20 Overall I recommend you don't cheap out and just move to the better step. Face it, you're kids are going to be hooked on detecting anyway, might as well prepare!	-1
Very cheap... extremely short	-1
Bought for my 13 yr old Godson... no way can I give this to him! It is tiny and looks cheap.	-1
I realize this is for young people but I still would expect it to work better than it does. Very very weak.	-1
detector would not even find a quarter i buried in 2 inches of coal ash	-1
Thought this would be a great idea to use in the backyard or park with the grandkids. All my 8 year old grandson wants to do is go out and use it, find stuff with it. After receiving it and reading all about how to use it properly, I put several different coins out in the backyard in the grass. I then had him try to find them. Such a let down. The thing just doesn't work as advertised. I've now purchased a real one. Don't waste your money unless you do just want a toy.	-1
My 6-yr-old's needs are pretty slim for a metal detector.  As long as he hears a noise he's usually good to go.  Unfortunately, this thing had no metal detecting ability short of being placed on top of the item.  If the item was barely placed under the dirt it couldn't find it.  The "meter" was either off or full.  I honestly can't believe the positive reviews.  This was sent back to Amazon this afternoon, so I'll keep looking.  It seems like all of the detectors in this price range get similar reviews, but I just can't be getting my son anything more technical.	-1
I purchased this for my son at the same time that I purchased one for me. This metal detector does not work as well as others in the same price range.  Save your money and buy something else.	-1
Bought this and the IV and NEITHER of them are accurate. Also bought the Ambient Weather Station and another hygrometer.  All of those out of the box are all within 2% of these and should be accurate out of the box with the settings in my house.  These are both over 10 degrees higher in temp and neither of them have the same humidity reading and both are WAY off.  If I can't calibrate it and it doesn't hold then money wasted.  I tried the factory restore to zero and both units are still way off and not even close to each other.  Personally, save yourself from wasting money and don't buy them.  Even if you can calibrate it why is it like this out of the box when this is supposed to be such a great item.  People that have good reviews - I hope you checked it for accuracy.  Two separate sellers and neither are calibrated so it can't have anything to do with where it came from.  It's the brand.  Sadly I have a third one coming!  Wasted money buying 3 of these because of the reviews!  So far 2 are junk out of the box.  If it won't measure temp what do you do with it?  Ambient Weather Station - out of the box ACCURATE  THIS IS JUNK	-1
worse piece of crap i ever purchased from amazon; stoped working after 3 months so i could not return it past 30 day window. i must admit it was very accurate regarding humidity  ( i compared it with my other hygrometers ) but the display just went blank....no read out no way to get it back to work; so if you want a 2 to 3 month hygrometer ...this has your name on it	-1
Warning:  My Caliber III Digital Hygrometer reads much higher than actual relative humidity level (approximately 10% higher than my other calibrated lab units).  If you require accurate relative humidity measurements, I would not recommend this unit--especially for critical applications (fine instruments for example).	-1
I know other people are giving this good reviews however here was my issue.  Shortly after purchasing this unit and placing in my humidor I noticed that I could not get my humidor up to 70% no matter how hard I tried. I thought I had leaks or something. I ended up putting a cup full of distilled water in the bottom of it to see if that would get the humidity up which eventually i did. But wait, was that mold i see now growing on my humidor draws? It sure was. turns out that my humidor was always at 70% but this hygrometer was reading 10% lower than what it actually was. This means I actually had my humidor up to 80% for while, no wonder i got mold.  So I contact [...] about my issue and they tell me that these units are defective and I need to contact the manufacturer for replacement. Well here I am 3 months after I tried to contact them  times with no response. So i guess you should purchase this item if you want to take the chance that you may receive one of the defective ones. Just make sure you figure it out sooner than I did as it was past eligibility to return it to Amazon.	-1
I purchased two of these.  While the temperature gauge seems to work fine, not too much can be said for the relative humidity.  The advertising states no calibration needed.  Nor can any calibration be done. There are two different readings always within 6% of each other.  So which one is accurate??  Who knows??? It tells me there is a lot to be said for the quality control and waste of money.  Not recommended.  Try something else.	-1
I am unhappy with this hygrometer.  I ordered two of these, identical, from separate vendors and received within a day of each other.  These are NOT accurate as described.  They currently are sitting side by side on my mantel.  There is a constant 6% difference in the hygrometer readings.  While the vendors were great in shipping right out this product is useless and inaccurate.  I purchased these based in-part on previous feedback.  These had a specific purpose for a grand piano where monitoring the humidity is highly recommended.  Action on what to do is would be based on the reading of the hygrometer.  This is junk, not accurate at all.  How do I determine which is accurate and which is not.  Order a couple more and take the average?  I think not.  These will be returned and I will continue my quest for a good hygrometer.  This product is NOT RECOMMENDED>	-1
I have two of these. Initially i set them up in the same space and found that they are + or - two difference on the temp and or humidity. After about a weeks use in separate spaces i found that on of the units displays "--%" for the humidity for much of the time. Customer service were not helpful at all.	-1
I bought this from Ace hardware today (Aug 2015). The water pressure needs to be low, otherwise the outlets pop out.  This is poorly designed. Our water pressure is around 60 PSI.  Unfortunately there is no product warning on unit itself or the tag specifying the not-to-exceed limit.	-1
I found that the unit leaked all around the adjusters in the top of the unit.  Otherwise the unit functions well.  I can not find a place where I can get an idea as to why this unit leaks so badly?  signed Perplexed?	-1
Junk	-1
Not a pass through device. The pressure is drastically reduced BEFORE reaching the adjustments, not reduced BY the adjustments. It does vary the flow that is allowed to pass, but that flow is not the input PSI. Would be fine for low volume, drip system. Made of plastic, the adjustment "screws" can be damaged relatively easily if you are not aware. Adjust very slowly and do not attempt to apply excess torque to any adjustment.	-1
I have two on line now, and FIVE broken ones. Figure one year life span at best. They break - on their own. They leak. The connections eventually blow out. The adjusters simply fail. Etc. All in all a pretty terrible product after a year!!!!!!!!!	-1
Trash, buy them and you will replace them withing the year with something else! For your sake, I hope it is not Orbit! Let's just say they DO leak, (8 out of 8!) no need to mention more.	-1
I imagine this might be perfect for small, not too heavy children, but for adults, it is very narrow and rickety.  Very uncomfortable and tenuous to mount and dismount!  I'll spend a bit more next time to get a better quality ladder.	-1
Rusted in one week.	-1
I thought a ladder came with our pool and had to deal with serious disappointment from my kids when we discovered it didn't  I ordered this and had it shipped with Prime thinking we could suffer through 2 more days...  One of those days was so hot the road LITERALLY melted in few places.  Unfortunately, I hurt my shoulder and the pool was just a tad too big for me to lift the kids over the side and even I can't step over at a Hobbit-sized 5'2".  I thought this economical option would be my savings grace and for the price, I could deal with their sad doe eyes for 2 eyes...  So, it shows up and the box is immediately opened. I dump the pieces out as the kids race to get into their swimsuits and then I almost start to cry.  There are 3 legs... THREE LEGS.  THIS LADDER AIN'T GOT NO LEGS, LIEUTENANT DAN!!!  How did the packer miss the FOURTH leg?  I scrambled to try to find a way to make it work for just another 2-3 days until Amazon the Amazing could ship a replacement, but with this design, there was nothing to be done.  Just putting it together to TRY, it felt flimsy and I was a bit worried about an adult using it.  It also doesn't seem at all rust resistant, so you better plan to take it out and dry it after every use.  I would spend a little more, or just keep shopping. I ended up finding an Intex ladder - same size, but coated metal and a design that seems better suited to long-term water exposure - for the same price at a local K-Mart, of all places.  If Amazon had had it, I'd have ordered it, but between those sad little faces and waiting out another heat wave, I just couldn't do it.  This was such a disappointment!	-1
Very difficult to use - too small & unsteady. I plan to replace it with wooden steps this year.	-1
This is not a plastic repair patch.  It is some kind of sticky glue that is used to bond one item to another item.  There were NO patches in this kit.  Just the glue..  This is not for repairing plastic inflatables with holes in them.	-1
yeah, didn't work. followed instructions exactly first time. second time, allowed to cure for a few days to give every opportunity to adhere well. in both cases, it washed off after being in water less than 30min.	-1
The Photo show them to be white but they are clear! Clear doesn't work!! Misrepresentation!	-1
Doesnt stick as well as you would expect it to, my wife had to use several layers to make it work.	-1
I was drawn to it because of the side brushes.  You would think that wilth all the curves and brushes you would be able to easily clean the sides of your pool where the sides meet the floor, especially if there is a radius at that point.  But then..you'd be wrong.  This head makes cleaning it harder because you have to come at it at funky angles and it won't stay flat.  It is too light for the job.  Not sure what kind of cast iron weights they are using but it must be some new alloy, the head tries to float at the bottom of the pool.  I'll live with it but this will be my last one.	-1
I have a strong one horsepower pump on my above ground pool, but this hand vacuum would only pick up about 25% of the daily dirt on the bottom of my pool. The rest of the dirt would get mixed in to the pool water. An hour after turning off the pump, the dirt suspended in the water would settle on the bottom of the pool again. Save yourself a lot of time, energy and money. Pick up a Kreepy Krauly vacuum and let it do all the work for you.	-1
Update!- I finally gave up on the uneven cooking "wimpy" Meco grill, and gave it to Salvation Army! I ended up biting the bullet, and buying the GREAT Weber gas grill with THICK iron grates at HD! Wish I had done this years ago!- It cooks sooo even, and No flareups (sheilded burners/ less smoke than the Meco too! Weber costs more, but supposedly lasts for years longer than el-cheapos! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I'm "REALLY!" in to a healthier lifestyle, and subscribe to "several" respected health e-zines.  1. 15+ years ago I read tests that charcoal BBQ's, really put "LOTS" of very bad carciniogens into your meat!  2. So I went to a gas BBQ. Not as good tasting as charcoal, but "SUPPOSEDLY" healthier? NOT!- Now I read tests that gas BBQ's are little healthier than charcoal. The "deadly" carciniogens are in the drippings smoke- coming from the hot lava rocks below!  3. So I now go to the MECO electric grill. Pros- a. Healthier- as virtually no smoke (grill/elements are steeply slanted, and drippings collect in a handy pan under the grill).  b. No having to mess with expensive propane gas...  c. Well made, and sturdy.  d. Low fire danger- Acceptable for most apartment complexes. ASK!  e. Sears steaks well (preheat on high for 15+ min, and close lid FAST! Requires a "Heavy Duty" electric outlet!). Cooks just as fast (or faster) than gas. BUT, "NO!" BBQ taste! You will probably need a marinade... Good "web search" recipe I found for steaks...- I pre-mix & rub in, a blend of- salt ("AlsoSalt"- is very healthy and GOOD tasting!), black pepper, chili powder (all in equal parts...), and a little cayenne pepper. You can also add any other seasonings you like, to taste...  PAM makes a "High Temp" cooking spray, for the grill.	-1
I love grilling my meat products on this grill:  pork chops, chicken legs, etc.  Anything that is greasy.  What I mean is, I purchased this grill to keep greasy cooking out of my kitchen.  This grill is very tedious to CLEAN.  The first couple of times I used it, I wiped it out pretty good and wiped clean the grill with paper towels.  After 10 or so more uses, and a couple of rolls of paper towels later, the cleaning got more and more difficult.  Not only that, but the black inside paint is now peeling.  Why?  I think it is too late to return it.  I was looking forward to try grilling with the turn thing.  Forget it.  I was frustrated when I put the grill together in the first place.  I still don't understand about how the metal piece on the right side functions.  I don't know now if I should just put the whole thing in the trash or what.  I was trying to avoid using propane but I will have to buy a propane grill next year if i expect to grill outside and I don't like using propane - I feel like it can be dangerous.	-1
MAY 26, 2013  My apologies to CHINA, TALKED TO MECO, THIS CRAP WAS MADE IN USA. SHAME ON US. I checked this MECO grill all over the internet. They must hire a lot of people to spend a lot of time writing POSITIVE REVIEWS on their product. My Meco Grill is sitting partially assembled waiting for MECO to open after the Memorial holidays, which means I can't use this junk till then. The instructions are in two languages for two different grills. Install instructions don't start until  the bottom of page 7 and are confusing to say the least. They ask you to install an acorn nut on a bolt for the "Rotisserie Lock To Hood/Bowl", The acorn nut has a nylon bushing inside to keep the nut from slipping off. Problem is the nut with the nylon in inside the grill which reaches temps up to 300 to 400 degrees. After this nut is installed there's no clue how this part is supposed to work. There's a part called "Bracket Motor Mounting", no directions how or what to use it for or how to install it on the grill. The hardware sent to assemble this grill must be left over's from the 1920's. the nuts to assemble the Table Top stand are square, you need pliers not a socket wrench. The hardware to attach the glass to the lid are WING NUTS. These are installed inside the grill where they can collect grease and food. There are 37 parts listed in the parts list and 38 parts shipped with the grill. The 38th part is a length of rubber gasket with no instructions for it's use. (JUST TALKED TO MECO, THEIR ERROR NO INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS PART. --- WOW!!!! When you open and close the lid of the grill, you get the feeling it's going to fall off. It actually rattles when you put it up or down. I can't wait to see what happens when I turn it on to use it. I'd send it back but, it's too much trouble and I threw away the box because I believed the reviews.  You're probably bored reading this so I'll close with CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP.	-1
I bought this grill only because I live in a Condo which prohibits gas grills. It is essentially made from cheap stamped metal parts and is worth maybe $49. The single main problem is it catches fire all the time. This grill does achieve much higher temperatures than other electric grills. It does so by putting a reflector pan about a half an inch below the electrical element. The juices are supposed to run across the reflector pan and drain into the botton of the grill. The problem is the pan heats to 600 degrees and is only a half an inch away from the element. Fat is not going to run across a 600 degree pan. It ignites almost immediatly. The only way to keep this thing from catching fire is to clean the pan thoroughly every time you use it. A very messy job !  The routisserie spit turns on a cutout in the thin metal. It scrapes like crazy ! For $200 they could have thrown in a cheap bushing like most grills have.  There are rally no differnet cooking temperatures. The elemnet is controled by a simple thermostat. The element is either on or off. Sound familiar ? Yep! THis thing is nothing more than an outdoor toaster oven !  It is now in the dumpster as the last time it caught fire the folks across from me called the fire dept. The Condo associaltion told them I must have a gas grill on my balconey because electric grills don't catch fire. I had to let the fireman go onto my balconey to verify it was an electric grill. That was enough for me and into the dumpster it went !	-1
from Connector on June 9, 2016  Poorly engineered product. Will not last more than 2-years. Control handle usually shorts out even taking all of the precautions they recommend (such as keeping it unplugged when not in use).  Don't waste your money on this.	-1
Tilt mechanism was damaged during a very light wind  after owning it for 2 weeks and after would not remain straight. I have tried to find help from California umbrella but this lead nowhere and I also tried fixing it myself which ended with the same results. I would not recommend or purchase again. Would of given it one star but the umbrella material seems of decent quality.	-1
as usual this is the second belt wrong size even with model #they say it fits its for a 36 inch deck	-1
overpriced and too short a handle for my oven. the wood handle started cracking when left outside.	-1
The first time my husband used it, the end fell off. Would not recommend it. Put together cheaply Not worth it.	-1
Expensive. Flimsy. Will not hold 18lbs of bird seed. (Easily will hold 10lbs. )Loose fitting too.	-1
I do believe this is the first Amazon purchase I have made that was totally unsatisfactory.  The can lid is so loose that a stiff wind will blow it off.  The main reason I bought this was to ensure the contents would stay in place.  Because of the fit of the lid, you have to pick the can up with both hands or the lid falls off.  It was very pricy and the tin is extremely flimsy.  Certainly not as advertised...and I would NOT recommend purchasing for either storage or ash disposal.	-1
It fine but very small. I was expecting something much bigger. It is an okay product but still using it.	-1
I ordered this can thinking it would hold a 13.9 bag of charcoal. It doesn't come close to the task.  I returned it because it is too small and the lid doesn't fit tight. I wanted a weather proof can to store charcoal in outside on the deck. I thought this would do the job and it won't. It's kind of a lightweight can and not what I had expected considering the name on it.	-1
In theory, this seems like a great idea, and I ordered it having watched too many cooking shows on Food Network. But for a home cook, it just wastes too much sauce and is difficult to clean.	-1
This item was received damaged-- bent base and separated weld. Either it's poorly made or was packaged inappropriately.	-1
Before anyone buys this or any other beer can chicken cooker, I think they should first read about Beer Can Chicken on AmazingRibs. Com. I wish I had before I wasted my money on this. It does however appear to be well made of good materials but the little drip tray is a lot smaller than I expected. I am using mine but I use an empty can with the top and bottom cut out essentially turning it into a vertical chicken roaster without the beer. I use a larger pan too. My wife is using this drip tray as a decorative salt & pepper shaker tray in her kitchen because it is attractive.	-1
The mop seems flimsy and the bucket does not have a handle.  The picture clearly shows a handle on the bucket.	-1
Bucket is great. The mop, well never used it. Came out of the packaging with an odd odor. I left it soaking in water and soap then dried it out. Still had the odor. At least I got to use the bucket.	-1
DO NOT BUY THESE!!!! The FIRST time I used them, I picked up a hot tray and had to immediately put it down or I would've burned my hands. I had to go into the house and get some regular oven mitts so I could carry in the food from the grill.	-1
These are essentially fancy leather welding gloves. Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal, that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature. Cooking mitts, on the other hand, need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat. They also need to insulate even if they're wet.  I found that this glove, despite being well made and attractive, is no good for holding hot items. At best, it protects hand and arm while grilling, if you're using tongs, lets say, over a very hot fire. Just don't expect to be able to hold a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds before the heat is conveyed directly to your tender skin and you have to put it down immediately or drop it.	-1
After reading the review, I bought these for my BBQ guy.  Unfortunately, they were WAY too small for guy-hands and too big for mine.	-1
didn't fit my Stihl.	-1
I ordered one of these some time ago and it was great so I ordered another and it came in COMPLETELY different packaging and IT DOES NOT FIT MY chainsaw. What a joke...not worth the hassle to return.	-1
still didn`t fit right	-1
I'm very disappointed in this thing. It is very noisy, very hard to pull start, and the gear drive gets very hot after only a few minutes use. The soil has to be already pretty loose and broke up or it will just sit there and bounce up and down. Its tempting to put one foot on it to hold it down but its got a picture of doing that on it with a big red circle and X on it.   I tried to use it on an area beside my trailer to put in a flower bed. The ground had never been broke up before but it wasn't packed down either. This  thing wouldn't even scratch the surface. I had to use my shovel and do it by hand the old fashioned way first. Then this thing still didn't do a very good job of tilling the soil.   After wrestling with this thing for 30 minutes my hands were numb from the vibration and my neck was killing me. This thing is a LOT harder to handle than the full size walk behind tiller I used to have. I should have used the money that I spent on this one to get a new motor put on my old one.	-1
What a piece of trash?  I'm sure that the manufacturer knows that this machine is completely useless!!!  Just used it for the first time today.  After just 5 minutes it seized up and won't start again.  How do I get my money back for something that only worked for 5 minutes?	-1
We've tried this once on everything - beef, chicken and fish.  We haven't cared for it on any of it and the rest will end up in the trash.  We've been on a search for the best rubs and this is not it.  I'm not sure what it really tastes like, but we much prefer Kansas City Steak seasoning on steaks and&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Char-Crust-Roasted-Garlic-Peppercorn-Rub-4-oz/dp/B000Q0V7RO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Char Crust Roasted Garlic Peppercorn Rub - 4 oz</a>&nbsp;on poultry and fish.  Won't be reordering.	-1
To Amazon Returns group I'd like to say thank you for your great service.  My returns were handled promptly and courteously.  When my first unit arrived broken Amazon immediately expedite shipped me a replacement and when the replacement one arrived broken as well, they provided me a full refund plus return shipping on both units.  To the people at Weed Eater...  Bummer, I gave your gas powered edger product a decent review however you may want to remove the term "Rugged" from your product description for this one as it appears unable to even survive shipping (oddly the boxes they shipped in were in pretty good shape, maybe they were rugged).	-1
I purchased my brand new Weed Eater Wheeled Trimmer at Wal-Mart, after seeing it marked down to $79.97. Quite a deal, I thought, since it sold for about $150.00 a couple of weeks before, (I think I know now why they were dumping them) and I've owned Weed Eater products all my life.  It was easy to assemble, and after a few minutes I was pushing it around my back yard cutting weeds. After 40 minutes of use, and after the trimmer had already fallen over several times, it fell over again, digging the .115 string into the ground and throwing a quarter sized rock at my face at a frightning speed. The rock hit me right below the left eye and split the skin open right to the cheek bone. I received 7 stitches at the emergency room. I honestly thought that my cheek bone was broken because of the intense pain and the deep purple brusing covering almost half of my face.  So, let me point out some quickly observed MAJOR problems with this wheeled trimmer in an attempt to save you from possible injury or disappointment.  1. The wheel base is WAY too narrow! Even on level ground the trimmer wants to tip over. If you have uneven ground, or the occasional "pot hole" you'll have to fight hard to keep the unit from falling over and the string digging ruts into the ground, or throwing rocks.  2. The trimmer it top heavy. Combine this with the narrow wheel base, and it's a recipe for disaster.  3. The engine is TOO powerful. You may think I'm nuts for saying this, but since the trimmer is fairly light weight and unstable, the RPM of the trimmer head is unbelievably fast. Way too fast.  4. The rock guard on the trimmer head is too small and "somewhat" ineffective. (I've never been hit in the face with a rock with any other trimmer)  5. The oddly shaped hand grips are too narrow, and you're constantly fighting to keep the trimmer upright.  6. The speed control lever is in a bad place and it is very difficult to keep the power (or speed) where you want to be. Full speed is too much, and idle is not enough. Trying to squeeze the lever to just the right speed is hard to do, since the same hand is always trying to hold the hand grip hard enough so the unit doesn't tip over.  7. It's too short. I'm 6 foot tall and I had to bend over to grip the handles. If you're just over 5 feet, it should be perfect for you.  All in all, Weed Eater had a good idea here. BUT, I find it VERY hard to believe they ever tested the trimmer in someone's backyard before it went to market. If the wheel base were about 10 inches wider, I don't think the trimmer would fall over. The rock guard, power lever, handle grips and height of the unit could also use some re-design.  I won't be using the trimmer again, and I don't recommend that anyone use this trimmer. And by the way, if you do insist on buying one, use some serious face and eye protection! I saw this trimmer throw a golf ball sized rock more than 30 feet. I should have stopped using it then...	-1
I read the negative reviews but hoped for the best. Paid $50 for 1 day shipping. Out of the box the unit is really great looking, I added the gas an oil and it started up easily. But the string chingo wudnt turn. I took the string head off and figured out the shaft wasn't connecting. I fiddled with it for an hour and finally got the string head to turn. I got it going on some weeds on my half acre and had a heck of a time keeping it up level , its not made for uneven ground and was easily turning over. It was loud even with my hearing protectors on. Sounds just like a chain saw. But man its powerfull. Unfortunately the string head kept giving me trouble and I had to take it into the garage 4 dif times b4 I faially gave up in discust. Now i will try to find a dealer to help me with this thing. In all I spent 4 hrs and only got a 20 /60' area cleard. I did more in a half hour with my lawn mower. But I can see if the string head stayed engaged and my property was level it cud be a viable unit. I wudnt recomend u purchase this thing after what I've ben thru.	-1
Less than average...that assumes you can get it started.  Get yourself a can of starting fluid.  Used it a year, and just last week, bought a Stihl.  Stihl cost more, but much better, AND YOU CAN START IT STANDING UP WITH IT IN YOUR HANDS (not recommended that you do that though)  I was so impressed with the Stihl LEAF BLOWER, that I thought, if the leaf blower starts this easily, maybe I should check on the Stilh chain saw...Now I plan on leaving the Poulan in the garage until I get the Stihl  stuck or wedged into a tree.	-1
I bought this saw in late 2012 and initially only used it for some light trimming around the yard. This Spring I helped a neighbor take down some small trees in his yard. He had the exact model Poulan chainsaw as I did. Everything went well until he was cutting up the second tree for haul away and his saw came to a stop. When we pulled on the start rope it was obvious that there was no compression in the engine. He had the saw looked at and was told that it was junk. The saw was only a year old. A couple of days later I took down two small trees at the edge of my property. Half way through the job my saw stopped running and locked up tight. A neighbor used his saw, not a Poulan, to finish the job. I was told that the saw would cost more to fix than it was worth. I have owned and used chainsaws for years. This Poulan saw worked well for a short time but certainly was not a quality tool. i will never buy Poulan again.	-1
Ran OK for first season, after that a constant battle to keep it running.  The other reviewers do a fine job of outlining the technical defects.  Just want to make sure this hunk of junk sinks in the ratings.	-1
Bought this chain saw and used it one time. A few months later decided to winterize it and the gas cap will not come off without channel locks. Turns out the geniuses who designed this beauty made a gas cap that swells once it comes in contact with fuel. So now the cap is so tight you would think someone literally glued it on. And it's almost impossible to put back on once you get it off. Horrible design I will never buy a garbage Poulan product ever again.	-1
I wasted so much time trying to keep this thing running...finally bought a real chainsaw and never had any issues again.  All my tools are gas powered and this Poulan pro 42cc chain saw is the most unreliable gas motor I've ever owned.  Dies every time you let go of the trigger, does not want to start again.	-1
I have had many saws, have a full arsenal of tools in my shop, fix things for a living, and am a very handy guy.  I bought this saw in a pinch from a local hardware store, price seemed great for the size of the motor/bar/features.  The poulan held up great for about six months of only occasional use, I have 2 extra chains and have kept them sharp, always kept the oiler full............    Then just like with other peoples reviews..........it just stopped running, It would be very difficult to start, and would die out.  cleaned and adjusted everything........and the best I can manage is an easy start, it will run.......with some moderation of the throttle......and will die when hot, and not be able to be restarted till cool, just like several other reviews.  I've tried every adjustment possible on the carb, and that is the best it will give.  Took it to my local lawnmower shop, and they told me the same as others here have been told, P.O.S........don't bother fixing.    I really wanted to like this saw, size & weight is good.........The tool-less adjuster actually works, too bad the whole package doesn't work.  One more gripe.  I didn't see any other reviews with this same problem, but the fuel cap on mine is/was very tight....to the point of not being able to take it on/off without tools, very annoying.  Avoid this saw like the plague..........it is a waste of your money.	-1
Cuts well when it runs, the problem is it is hard to keep running. The idle adjustments are covered to prevent user adjustments so you have to pay to have a shop do it. I will not buy anything Poulan after this. I will pay more and stick with Echo or Stihl.	-1
Nearly worthless as a chain saw, but not a bad door stop. Just spend the extra bucks for that Stihl you KNOW you should have bought in the first place.	-1
junk.	-1
This is the single most frustrating piece of lawn "equipment" I have ever owned and used in 48 years. Takes many, many pulls to start, (yes, I follow the instructions to the letter), and still I struggle. Once started, WHEW, it runs better on "half or partial choke setting", then it does in "run" setting. I have had mine about one year and now when I do get it started and move it to "run" in immediately stops. (It has done this since I bought it brand new.) If am ever so fortunate to get it to operate in the "run" setting it stops as soon as I pull the trigger to use it. It is also so INCREDIBLY LOUD, YES, I AM SHOUTING TO MAKE A POINT!! Without ear plugs I actually have an earache in both ears when I am doing using it for 10 minutes. I am so very, very disappointed in so many ways! I don't even know that I would donate it to a charity to be "fixed". Why give them my problems, I am sure that have enough of their own. Don't waste your money on this one! I am so sorry I did!	-1
I just received mine via UPS. I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but I thought I should warn potential buyers about the way the thing is packaged. When I opened it up, the cardboard section that was supposed to hold the motor case in place had ripped and shifted so the motor was flopping around in the box, (which was a little beat up, the box that is; UPS isn't very gentle with packages sometimes). I took the thing out and put the saw attachment on it to test it out, attached a drop cord to it and pressed the switch to turn it on; NOTHING! I was not happy! I could see myself packing the bloody thing up and going through the hassle of shipping it back, so I decided to have a look inside it and see if it was something simple that was wrong. After some checking with a meter I could see power getting to the motor. I looked at the brushes and one of them had jumped past the end of the spring that puts pressure on the brush to hold it against the armature. I put it back in place and got the spring where it belonged, BEHIND the brush, put the case back together, and now it works. My theory is that the package had been dropped or whatever, and the impact, which did not break the motor case(it must be sturdy!) but did  knock the motor brush out of it's place. I say all this to tell you that this tool is packaged to sit gently on a store shelf, IT IS NOT PACKAGED PROPERLY FOR SHIPPING. It needs to be over-packaged or at least needs some foam blocks in the box to hold that heavy motor in place. So buyer beware. If I could have bought this at a local store, I would have, as it is easier and cheaper for return situations. ACE hardware sells it on their website for the same price, but some reviews of their 'free shipping to store nearest you' scared me off. I will add a review later after I have used it for awhile, and adjust the 'stars' perhaps. The one star is for my initial experience, which was lousy. --P.S.--It does come with the string trimmer attachment as a bonus.	-1
i ony got it to start once--it pulls so hard even the neighbor football player could not pull it over, i pulled the plug, and turned over fine BUT NOT WITH PLUG IN it will break the cord--piece of crap it is, i even tried to find a compression release for it - NOT AVAILABLE, so it sits under the bench	-1
If you can get this at a discount price it's not a bad deal. I got mine from Amazon for $67, and at that price, there's really nothing else on the market that is significantly better. But, if you're willing to spend more, then there are better choices.  This model has some benefits - when it runs, it has a lot of power to get through tough weeds. The bump and feed works as well as a bump and feed system can work.  The key words are "when it runs." Starting is a bit tough (and yes, I followed the directions to the letter, had the proper oil/gas mix, etc.) and it has a finicky idle. It will also occasionally just cut out under full load. Sometimes it restarts, sometimes you get an aerobic workout with the cord. It's not just a string trimmer, it's an upper body toner!  It got a good review at Popular Mechanics as the leading budget string trimmer. For my needs it's a workable choice - I have a small yard but lots of trees and obstacles that makes using an electric model a real pain due to the cord. If it cuts out before I'm done, I just put it away and try again next time I cut the lawn. But, if you have a big yard and need something that starts and runs reliably (and are willing to spend $175+), then you'd be happier with a model from a more durable, well-built brand such as Echo.  One more thing - if you get one and it breaks, don't even bother trying to deal with the "customer service" folks. You'll just waste a whole lot of your time and nothing will get fixed. Your better option is to donate it to a local school or vocational center - sometimes they have programs where they take in broken equipment, have the kids fix it (as a way of learning small engine repair) and then sell it to raise funds for the school.  UPDATE:  The starting problem got worse and worse, to the point that it was almost faster to trim the grass by hand. Ditched it and replaced it with a Troy-Bilt 70SS model. Just a few bucks more (Amazon had a sale on that as well) and it's been a night and day difference. The Troy-Bilt starts every time on no more than 3 pulls, and their spring assist system makes janking the cord a breeze.  On the down side, their bump head is not as good as the Weed Eater but what's the benefit of a good bump head when you can't get the thing started or, if it actually starts, have it keep running!!  Don't know what the long term reliabiity will be like for the Troy Bilt but so far, it's been a joy to use. Good riddance Weed Eater! Never again!!  I take back the three stars and give it a ZERO	-1
With now mulching this made little difference.	-1
Did not fit the listed model. Returned	-1
This was the first chainsaw I ever bought and likely my last Poulan. For starters, like so many others have said, it is very hard to start. Follow the priming and choke instructions to a "T" and it will still be hard to start. Make sure when you pump the primer bulb it actually is pumping fuel. I have noticed many times it takes more time just to get it primed then you count from that point the number of times you need to pump the bulb. To make matters worse once you get it to start it doesn't want to stay started. On many occasions it has stalled especially if you give it more gas. I have to very slowly release the throttle to keep it from stalling.  One it is started it cuts wood fairly well. I bought it for light to medium duty. I got a chain sharpening kit but it didn't sharpen the chain that well so I have bought 1 new chain since I've owned it. It goes through fuel and chain oil fast.  I have had this chainsaw for several years but it soon will be time to buy a new chainsaw as I am tired of the constant starting problems.	-1
Bought this saw last summer, couldn't get it to start, so I just stored it, maybe hoping to forget about it. I really should have returned it and after a while it became too late. This winter we had a tree fall across our driveway while we were in Florida, that now has to be cut up and moved totally out of the way. After 8 months I hauled out the Poulan....OK, maybe it will work. New gas, bar oil, even quick start, nope, ain't gonna start, not even a sputter. Lets pull the plug and spray quick start directly into the cylinder. What the heck is a Touch R7 spark plug, and why is there one in this saw when the manual specifies a Champion RCJ-7Y. Down to the small engine dealer, returned home with plug in hand, installed it and on the 2nd pull it started and ran for a while. I'm a little happier now. Next problem, making a tool to adjust the H-L screws that now have a spline and are not easily adjusted, just one more frustration. One solution is to cut a slot in the screws with a Dremel tool and use a flat screwdriver to adjust them. Lots of solutions to these screws on the Internet. Everyone knows when in the bush you need 4 tools, 1 wrench for the bar, a file for the chain, a spark plug socket and a flat screwdriver to adjust the fuel mixture. Will write a follow up later when and if I get it running.	-1
I've had mine two years and used it four times. It cuts fine if you can get it started. Hard starting, especially when hot, even if you follow their directions. It won't idle more than a few seconds. I would not buy it again.	-1
Don't buy this trimmer, You'll be sorry!  This trimmer was purchased a few years ago. I live in the northern USA, so the trimmer sees light duty only being used maybe a half dozen times a year during the summer, being stored the rest of the time. This is its third summer. When I filled it with gas and tried to start, it gave me some trouble, but finally started. I let it warm up in #2 position, when I flipped off the choke and tried to rev the engine, it died, like it was starving for fuel. Tried again, ...same thing. Tried again ...same thing etc.etc. I thought there might be some debris in the carb so I pulled it apart. It was clean as a whistle, put it back together, tried to start, ...same thing. Checked the fuel filter which is at the end of the pick up tube in the fuel tank, (you have to fish it out). Filter was clean. Checked the spark plug, it was clean.  Now I'm just scratching my head. I figure I used this trimmer all of a dozen times and now it won't work. It's either bring it to the shop and pay half of what it's worth to fix it, or cut my losses and just buy a different trimmer. I chose the latter and I guarantee you it won't be a Troy Built. I have lots of power toys, most have lasted a decade or more with no trouble, and start on the first or second pull after being stored all winter. I had an old Homelite Chain Saw that was thirty years old and running strong when I gave it away. There is just no excuse for this kind of crap to be on the market. Next time I'll pay a little extra and get a quality brand. I guess I was fooled by the name. Troy Built used to be synonymous with Quality, but no more.	-1
I will say this trimmer ran great for two summers. It was powerful and easy to handle for this woman in her 40's. This third summer it won't stay running. I read another review with the same problem. Good trimmer for 2 summers, moderate use, maybe 6 times all summer. Maintained, stored in a dry place. Third summer it starts but won't stay running. My mechanic friend said all the filters are clean, good fuel, but its only getting the fuel you pre-pump to start it. It would cost about the same to fix what is probably a carburetor problem as buy a new one. Not worth it. And after reading other similar reviews I'm going with something else.	-1
Poor quality. Started leaking after few uses and have to adjust the chain every time of use. You can do better with any other kind of electric chain saw. For sure I had bad experience with this tool and it was too late to return it as I used it infrequently.	-1
The chain tension adjustment screw nut split in half when I attempted to adjust the chain tension as part of the initial saw setup. This happened while I turned the adjustment screw with a screwdriver using only moderate pressure. Very disappointed. I returned the saw.	-1
Purchased saw to trim some medium sized trees. Unfortunately, when reading the literature which came with the saw, it states that using an extension cord more than 50 feet long is not recommended and that the saw could overheat with a longer extension cord. This makes it unuseable for anyone except those who have trees within 50 feet of an electrical outlet. You could use a gasoline generator, but this defeats the purpose of an electric saw and it is impractical. Nowhere on the website description does it caution you about this problem and this is a mistake for Amazon which I assume has many of these items returned for various reasons. Description should contain the extension cord limitation.	-1
Written in the blush of new ownership:  Let's be clear, this is not a go into the forest and cut wood for the winter chainsaw.  I bought this saw to use as a shop tool for preparation of blanks for woodturning.  Having said that, it cuts very well, has sufficient power for the purpose, is not too loud and is well balanced.  It is well made for the duty for which it is designed.  Several have reported that the sprocket gear was plastic.  Mine is metal.  It looks like it might be pretty light, but it is metal.  I expect it to hold up well under the use that I intend for it.  I would expect it to hold up for normal home tree maintenance use.  I would not expect it to hold up to days of bucking logs.  Cold experience:  Over the past 10 months or so, I have cut about 10 short log sections into chunks and cut some vertically for bowl blanks.  I don't think this constitutes a lot of use.  The painted name on the bar is barely marred.  The chain is still quite sharp.  Today I was cutting a log vertically which is the easiest cut for a saw as you are cutting with the grain.  Chain is nice and sharp, everything is great, except suddenly the motor is running and the chain is still.  Fast forward through a lot of diagnostic stuff to learn that the sprocket in the inside of the saw is in fact plastic and has in fact melted.  I was looking at the outside sprocket when I said it was metal.  My money was completely wasted.  This saw is junk as a number of other reviewers stated.  The best part of the whole thing was when I called Poulan customer service at 3:55 PM Central time and was told that the "general questions" section was closed, their hours being from 8:00 to 4:30 Central time.  I can't speak for customer service but their engineering department is clearly closed.  Avoid this purchase.	-1

I got about a half an hour out of the motor cutting some small pine trees into firewood.  I think I got four wheelbarrows of cord wood before the brushes started throwing sparks and the motor slowing down.  Then the GFI tripped and I was done.  Sent it back for a refund.	-1
I've used two of these syphon injectors for over a year and found that even with an extremely fine prefilter, they clog and stop syphoning once every ten minutes. When this happens I have to pull the small black hoses off and clear the syphon. They work good when syphoning, but the frequent clogging problems means they are not something from which you can start and walk away.	-1
I bought this for my grand kids what a waste of money this was a  replacement head for the one that comes with the machine it worked just as bad. Don't waste your money	-1
hard to get  rubber hose on far enough.  ended up that the plastic ones works better.	-1
Made for thick wide heavy duty hose ... won't fit my average size hose	-1
These are aluminum NOT brass. They are lightly anodized aluminum. They galvanically corrode and sieze permanently to any brass fittings. The neck of the male and female versions of this part quickly corrodes through and breaks off.  The fact that they lie about the material shoud be enough to warn you off.	-1
Not brass brass plated or paint not sure corroded very fast with well water. Total junk Would not recomend them	-1
I purchased both female and male couplings. The male units seal on the rubber hose and work fine. The female coupling seals on the hose, but leaks at the junction of the threaded swivel and the brass fitting.	-1
I have had several of these and multiple times the clamp has cracked open when tightening down.  So I question the comment "Premium construction for maximum strength and durability".	-1
I got about 5 years of use before the metal housing itself corroded through.	-1
not for Singapore.	-1
UPDATE: So I didn't bring my hoses in to the garage before the first frost.  My bad, I guess.  To my dismay, both of my nozzles froze and SPLIT making them unusable junk.  Both the plastic casing and the metal interior split right along the seam.  Now, this is partially user error but it is certainly something potential buyers should be aware of.  Other nozzles I've owned in the past have gotten left outside for an entire winter without suffering any damage.  I am super disappointed.  If I wanted something that fragile I'd have bought something from the dollar store. I have to retract my previous glowing review (below)  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I have bought so many hose nozzles over the years, from cheap to not-so-cheap.  They last a few seasons and then get clogged, leak or just plain break.  This Gilmour nozzle feels like it will last forever.  Nice solid feel, easy to use, good control over spray and velocity.  The threaded front is a bonus.  I add a "water breaker" to turn it into a gentle shower head for watering potted plants, without slowing me down by restricting the water volume output.  I can also screw on a pressure nozzle for a more focused spray and still have the pistol grip on/off.  Really happy with this purchase!	-1
This is just a plastic wrapper around an ordinary cheap pot-metal spray gun. An ordinary Southern winter blew out the metal and rendered it worthless.	-1
Threads not good and I had to toss it in the junk pile. Saving it for a crooked hose thread where it might work with a force crank. Be careful. If buying retail look for damaged or improperly mfg threads.	-1
Well, it's only a year old and it's on it's way out.  Don't count on it lasting more than one season.  The metal lock clip is missing, so it can't be locked in the on position.  There's a black plastic small rod which scrapes my hand every time I pick up the nozzle.  With the generally good reviews I expected more from this product.	-1
Edit:Gilmour no longer adheres to Lifetime warranty  My first nozzle sprang a leak after only one year, even after draining and storing it properly.  I called, and they replaced it.  The second unit lasted one summer as well.  Same deal, it began leaking around the metal seals.  This time no warranty since the company has now changed hands.	-1
you can get this in any store for half the price. nothing special about it, the packets you mix yourself are just as effective	-1
This product might be convenient, but I recommend NOT using it.  It contains red dye and a preservative, both of which may be damaging to hummingbirds.  You do not need red food coloring in nectar in order to attract hummingbirds.  Most hummingbird feeders have plenty of red on them to attract the birds.  A simple mixture of 4 parts water to 1 part granulated sugar is all that is needed for hummingbird nectar. Never use honey or sugar substitutes.  It's simple to make nectar and keep refrigerated and certainly safe for the birds.  We prefer safeguarding the health of these little birds rather than the supposed convenience of this product.	-1
Even though this is a very pretty feeder, my hummingbirds have totally ignored this feeder for some reason.  They prefer my window feeders to this one.  I'm not happy with this feeder.	-1
This is a pretty glass hummer feeder.  However, it is not easy to snap the base on and off, and the paint is already coming off after having been outside during a few rainstorms.	-1
started leaking after a few weeks of use...disappointing.	-1
Poorly made.  The top is too small to sit on base	-1

Had problems with this detector out of the box. Problems falsing, problems pin pointing, arm cuff broke after normal use. I do like the coil however.  I found another detector and it has been working for years without problems. Its the same price as the Ace 250, and it even comes with a pin pointer and sniper coil. Heres the link if anyones interested, I did have much luck with Garrett. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KHUC8NU?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00KHUC8NU&linkCode=xm2&tag=jrsqe-20	-1
Purchased this metal detector as my second detector. I previously owned a Bounty Hunter and wanted to go a step up. The hobby of metal detecting grew on me almost immediately and now its one of my favorite things to do. I bought this with high hopes, that were quickly let down. At first, all was going well, then the problems started. Random falsing began and continued even with fresh batteries. Then after about 3 months of use, the arm rest broke. After nothing but problems for about 5 months I decided to hang up the Ace 250 for another detector.  I bought this for a round the same price, and it came with a pin pointer. I have had no problems and have even pulled silver coins and gold necklaces with the alternate detector. From personal experience I advice you stay away from this detector. If you are interested in a detector that I has my seal of approval, with over 500 hours of detecting, here is the link. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KURXKY?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B001KURXKY&linkCode=xm2&tag=jrsqe-20	-1
